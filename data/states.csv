(Otto Kitsinger for Idaho Capital Sun)After 88 days in session, the Idaho Legislature moved closer to finishing its business for the year Thursday at the Idaho State Capitol in Boise. 
On Thursday night, the Idaho House of Representatives adjourned until 10 a.m. Friday, while the Idaho Senate adjourned until 9:30 a.m. Friday.
Legislators hoped to wrap up all of their work Thursday. But just before 7 p.m., Senate Majority Leader Lori Den Hartog, R-Meridian, said the Senate was short on staff and the paperwork and procedural work necessary to wrap up would have taxed the staff and kept everyone at the Statehouse way too late.
Moments later, House Majority Leader Jason Monks, R-Meridian, said the House hopes to finish its work Friday, but House members may need to work into the afternoon. 
“Hopefully we’ll be able to finish it all up tomorrow,” Monks said Thursday night. 
   Idaho legislators pass many unresolved state agency budgets 

To move closer to adjournment, legislators passed many of the unresolved agency budgets over the course of about 12 hours Thursday. 
The Idaho Senate kicked off the action Thursday morning by unanimously passing a key fiscal year 2026 natural resources maintenance of operations budget that the Senate had retained on its calendar for a month without taking action.
The natural resources budget, House Bill 248, was the last of 10 maintenance of operations budgets that needed to pass both chambers of the Idaho Legislature. The Idaho House of Representatives had already passed the natural resources budget back on Feb. 20.
By Thursday afternoon, the House picked up the budget-passing baton, passing key budgets for the Idaho Transportation Department, the Idaho Office of Energy and Mineral Resources and Idaho State Liquor Division — all three of which had previously failed. 
Thursday’s action by the Idaho Senate and Idaho House to pass many of the final budgets built upon the momentum JFAC generated a day earlier by rewriting the final failed budget enhancements and sending those rewritten budgets on to the Idaho House and Idaho Senate. 
  Budget committee co-chairwoman says fiscal year 2026 budget represents 6.7% increase over 2025 

During a break in the action Thursday, Rep. Wendy Horman, R-Idaho Falls, provided a summary of the fiscal year 2026 budget. Horman said the full budget represents a 6.7% increase over the current budget, with 5% of the increase accounted for in the maintenance of operations budgets.
Horman said legislators are leaving a $400 million ending balance, in case of an economic downturn.
“We have work that we can all be proud of, because we have been able to fund essential governance services while returning as much money to the taxpayer as possible in setting a balanced budget,” Horman said. 
Thursday was the 88th day of the 2025 legislative session, which gaveled in back on Jan. 6.
There is no requirement to adjourn legislative sessions by any certain date.
Most legislative sessions run for about 80 to 90 days.

(Photo by James Brooks)Rather than target Alaska in its response to a new round of tariffs levied by President Donald Trump, the Yukon government plans to pick on Trump adviser Elon Musk.
The action stands in contrast to moves taken by other provinces, such as British Columbia, which is considering a bill that could result in tolls on Alaska-bound vehicles.
In a statement Thursday, Yukon Premier Ranj Pillai said the territory will end its satellite Internet contracts with Starlink, a Musk-owned company.
The Yukon has about 90 Starlink contracts, serving isolated road maintenance stations, hospitals, and other facilities.
Electric vehicles and chargers manufactured by Tesla — another Musk-owned company — will no longer be eligible for the Yukon’s Good Energy Program, which offers incentives to residents who buy electric vehicles and energy-efficient appliances.
The territory’s official communications will switch away from X, the social media platform formerly known as Twitter. That platform is also owned by Musk, who limits news content and uses it to spread pro-Trump positions.
“These measures build on our initial response, which included ending the sale of U.S. alcohol in government-run liquor stores and stopping any new wholesale orders for U.S. liquor,” Pillai said in a news conference.
Pillai said he spoke with Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney and other provincial leaders early Thursday, and that those leaders intended to take additional actions.
He noted that Alaskans share a close relationship with the Yukon and thanked Sen. Lisa Murkowski, R-Alaska, for voting to end some tariffs that target Canada.
“We want Americans to keep coming here, keep spending money here, keep visiting your friends and family members in the Yukon and in Canada,” Pillai said. “Show your support for Canada by visiting Canada and by understanding why not as many of us may be in a hurry to come and visit you.”

(Lindsey Toomer/Colorado Newsline)U.S. Secretary of Energy Chris Wright, returning to the Denver area Thursday after he was confirmed as a member of President Donald Trump’s cabinet, repeatedly minimized the consequences of climate change when speaking to reporters during a press conference. 
Wright, founder of Denver-based fracking services company Liberty Energy, spoke to employees at the Department of Energy’s National Renewable Energy Laboratory in Golden for less than 10 minutes, touching on powering artificial intelligence, electricity production and growth, and supporting national labs. 
Talking to reporters after he spoke to staff, Wright said “emotional, not-fact-based stuff” like targeting hydrocarbons — the main components of climate change-causing fossil fuels — for reductions is “disruptive” and led to higher electricity and energy prices during the Biden administration.

Wright said that attributing the Marshall Fire — which in 2021 destroyed more than 1,000 homes in Boulder County, burned over 6,000 acres, caused more than $2 billion in property damage and killed two people — to climate change is “simply to not look at the data.” He said wildfires “peaked over 100 years ago” and that the U.S. government could better manage wildfire devastation through forest management to control wood fuels. 
“Calling climate change a crisis is just to say ‘I’m not going to look at the science, I’m not going to look at the economics, I’m just going to run with the politics,’” Wright said. 
Drier and hotter conditions in Colorado are widely viewed as having contributed to the severity of the Marshall Fire, making the potential for loss greater. Investigators said one of the fire’s origins was a spark from an Xcel Energy power line, and the utility company has since faced several lawsuits.
Wright has previously expressed deep skepticism of the scientific consensus that climate change is a global crisis.
Department layoffs
The Department of Energy, along with many other federal agencies, laid off probationary staff members, and a judge then ordered the department reinstate them. The Trump administration asked all department heads to plan for additional cuts through a “reduction in force” process. 
Wright did not say how many more employees within his department could expect to lose their jobs, but he said downsizing is an “ongoing process” and that “it would be downright irresponsible if we weren’t doing this.” He said department staff grew by 20% over the four years before he took over, and “what we got out of it was a little bit more restrictions in energy production around the country.” 
Energy Department leadership told workers this week it will undergo “restructuring.” Wright said each department will undergo “a very detailed organization, bottom up.” 
“Every part of the government, we have to look at, how can we make government services as good as they are today or better, but at lower cost,” Wright said. “Like I do with my business, we have to look carefully at the business of where we are today and how can we deliver services at least as good as we are today at lower cost.”
In Wright’s talk to staff at the NREL, he applauded the work and dedication of the employees he spoke with and said their work is “critical.”
“The range of stuff I saw today, different people that spoke on different technologies, incredibly impressive, passionate, smart people that you can see from their heart that believe in what they’re doing, that love what they’re doing,” Wright said.

After he was appointed, Wright said one of his first moves was to bring together leaders of the national labs from around the country to ask what they needed to make their work more efficient. Last week, he issued a secretarial order making changes he said resulted from those conversations. 
Artificial intelligence is “the next energy-intensive manufacturing industry,” Wright said in Golden, and the U.S. should not outsource that energy production to other countries. He said he issued a request for information Thursday to gauge developer interest in building on DOE land around the country to power AI.  
“We have land at all of our national labs and DOE sites around the country — who wants to come build a data center, build (a) nearby energy system, use the technology and smarts we got at the national lab … Maybe donate some computing power to us, or some lease money for the lands that’ll help fund our research,” Wright said. “We’re trying to find different ways to make the labs faster, smarter, better and more self-sufficient, more funding from other sources as well.” 
Wright said he would make “a commercial arrangement” with private data center companies that want to use federal land, because “that’s where the capital is.” 
NREL is responsible for researching and developing renewable energy systems and improving energy efficiency in the U.S. It has another campus in Arvada, as well as one in Alaska and in Washington, D.C., with 3,675 employees across the four locations.

(John Hult/South Dakota Searchlight)SIOUX FALLS — A $729,000 consultant contract will be added to the roughly $50 million South Dakota has already spent on a stalled prison construction effort. 
State officials signed a contract this week to pay a consultant to repeat and update a $323,000 prison facilities report that has framed three years of discussions on the state’s correctional needs.
The contract with Phoenix-based Arrington Watkins is just the latest deduction from a $62 million pool of money spent down to less than a fifth of its original size to prepare for a now-paused Lincoln County prison project.
On Thursday, representatives with the Gov. Larry Rhoden administration acknowledged that taxpayers will be out most of that money unless lawmakers vote to revive the controversial project — or a scaled-down version of it — during a June special legislative session.
Prison work group peppered with public testimony in first Sioux Falls meeting

About $50 million of the money is already gone. It was spent to secure land, design a campus, and secure a stake in the electrical, water and sewer infrastructure that would’ve been necessary to house and care for 1,500 inmates. The state’s under contract to spend millions more, but has paused that work.
The state could “claw back” some of that $50 million, but Lt. Gov. Tony Venhuizen said the administration knew there could be “significant costs” to shifting course.
“We’re doing what we can to reduce that, but it could be a considerable amount, and that’s something we have to consider as we move forward,” Venhuzen said after a meeting of the Project Prison Reset work group at the South Dakota Military Heritage Alliance.
The state based its earlier decision to pursue an $825 million facility largely on the recommendations of a 2022 report from the Omaha-based DLR Group. Lawmakers rejected that idea in February.
That report outlined the state’s correctional system deficiencies and recommended a host of potential solutions. The lawmakers most skeptical of the Lincoln County prison proposal repeatedly cited that report’s lower men’s prison price estimate, as well as its smaller-scale alternative prison construction options. 
The forthcoming Arrington Watkins report will ask the same sorts of questions. Ryan Brunner, the Rhoden adviser who serves as his point person on prison issues, said Thursday that eight members of the work group reviewed the contract before the state signed it.
The state is also preparing to release a request for information, Brunner said, seeking interest from any landowners who might be willing to sell their property to the state for prison projects.
Work performed based on old report
After the meeting, Venhuizen said the work group would use the Arrington Watkins report and any interest gleaned from the land-seeking notice to decide where to go next on prison construction.
The DLR suggested a 1,300-bed men’s prison, but affixed a far smaller price tag than the one lawmakers were presented with last November. 
Under the direction of the Department of Corrections, a 2022 summer study group endorsed a 1,500-bed facility. 
Initial 2023 design contracts for that facility, partially redacted versions of which were given to South Dakota Searchlight by the DOC last month, put the top price at $450 million — roughly in line with DLR Group’s estimates. An amended contract soon pushed that figure higher. A contract amendment in April of 2024 put the “not to exceed” price at $740 million.

That figure was not offered during a legislative Appropriations Committee the following month, though. At that meeting, and another legislative meeting later that summer, lawmakers were told that the “guaranteed maximum price” would come in November. 
By the time that $825 million number arrived, the state had already spent millions to design the facility, drill test bores for a possible geothermal energy system, and to scan for cultural artifacts and wetlands.
The state continued to sign contracts for the Lincoln County prison project into early 2025. The $825 million guaranteed price expired in March.
Lawmakers who’d hoped to move forward with the project warned their compatriots that the price would only grow through inaction. 
Michelle Jensen, one of the Lincoln County landowners who sued the state over the prison plan, offered a different perspective in her public testimony to the work group on Thursday.
Jensen noted that a final decision from the state Supreme Court in that lawsuit could come after the June special session. 
The remedy for financial losses in Lincoln County, Jensen said, should have been for the state to “stop spending money out there if you know it’s a thing that might not happen.”
Jensen also suggested that the state could sell the land. 
The DOC transferred about $8 million to the Office of School and Public Lands to obtain the title to the 320 Lincoln County acres upon which it had hoped to build its prison. The land had passed into the ownership of the state Office of School and Public Lands years ago when the owners died without heirs or a will. 
On a roadside viewing of the property Wednesday afternoon, Brunner told the work group that the state only needed half the property for the prison, and that the other half was reserved for possible future use.
Federal funding could still benefit state, but only near Lennox
Brunner sounded a hopeful note Thursday on a $10.5 million contract with the city of Lennox for a sewer line. 
The line’s not in the ground yet, even though Lennox has collected the money.

Funding for all but $500,000 of that contract came from the federal American Rescue Plan Act of 2021. The ARPA dollars had to be obligated to a water or sewer infrastructure project by Dec. 31, 2024.
Had the prison project gone forward, Lennox would’ve been in line for $50,000 monthly payments from the state. Those monthly payments would amount to less than $30 per person for each of the people — inmates and staff — who’d have used the prison’s toilets, sinks and showers. 
“It’s not that much different than your household sewer bill,” Brunner reasoned on Thursday. “And so we don’t start paying that until we actually start running sewage.”
If the work group picks a site within 10 miles of Lennox in any direction for any other prison project, Brunner said, the state will still get something from that investment.
“If you’re within 10 miles of Lennox, it’s possible we could run that line to it,” Brunner said.
The state also entered into agreements with Southeastern Electric Cooperative and South Lincoln Rural Water to pay for portions of upgrades planned by the respective utility providers. The state has paid for some of its stake in those projects. Brunner said the state could still pull out of a substation project, since the station has yet to be placed and could move to another location.

(John Hult/South Dakota Searchlight)SIOUX FALLS — Twenty people lined up Thursday at the Military Heritage Alliance to share their thoughts on South Dakota’s correctional needs with the group of lawmakers and other assorted officials tasked with finding ways to address prison overcrowding.
There was talk of offender re-entry, rehabilitation and second chances. The state penitentiary in Sioux Falls was called unsafe and inadequate, but also endorsed as a building with life left in it. There were calls for a work release center in Vermillion and a small, new men’s prison in Rapid City.
One prominent idea, however, drew no public support: the $825 million men’s prison the state Department of Corrections spent $50 million last year preparing to build before lawmakers shut it down. 
With $50 million spent already, state hires new consultant to restart prison planning

The public testimony came at the end of the first meeting for the Project Prison Reset work group. Gov. Larry Rhoden created the group in response to the legislative defeat of the 1,500-bed Lincoln County prison project, asking its members to determine what, if anything, should be built to ease the burden on the state’s correctional facilities.
During the first half of the all-day Thursday affair, Corrections Secretary Kellie Wasko repeated statistics she’s rattled off over the past three years. The state penitentiary in Sioux Falls has twice the inmates it’s designed for. Other facilities, such as the Rapid City minimum custody center, have as many as triple the inmates they ought to.
Mike Durfee State Prison in Springfield, a former college campus, is home to more than a thousand inmates. That population, Wasko told the work group, shouldn’t rise above the hundreds.
It’s the state penitentiary and its once-hoped-for Lincoln County replacement, however, that served as both the catalyst for the work group’s creation and the flurry of public commentary its members faced Thursday.
Safety, location concerns
A parolee who’d been ducking supervision shot a police officer on Tuesday afternoon in central Sioux Falls, Mayor Paul TenHaken noted in his testimony. He suggested the state prison system releases inmates it shouldn’t because “there’s no room at the inn.”

Without a new prison, TenHaken said, “I’m afraid we’re going to continue to see the kind of thing we saw this week.”
TenHaken has said in the past that he’d rather not have a prison in Sioux Falls city limits, but said Thursday he hadn’t come to the meeting to stake out a position on the site. 
Joel Arends did, though. Arends represents southern Sioux Falls on the Lincoln County Commission. He called the proposition of a prison on land that would otherwise become high-value homes “a buzzkill” for his county, one of the fastest-growing in the state. 
“The prison site is designed for rural housing, not commercial, industrial uses,” Arends said.
Another Lincoln County commissioner, Douglas Putnam, argued that the penitentiary has never been well-placed in Sioux Falls. It was built prior to statehood, and Putnam said the logic behind placing the Capitol in the middle of the state ought to apply as its leaders now ponder a replacement for the 1881 facility in South Dakota’s southeast corner.
“This needs to be in the middle of the state, to serve everybody,” Putnam said. 
Some call rehabilitation, second chances key to reform
Karen Schwebach, a 30-year prison volunteer, zeroed in on the potential of mercy to lessen the state’s correctional workload. There are numerous inmates with life sentences who have long since changed their ways, she said, and clemency actions for those with records of self-improvement ought to be part of any conversation on how to address the prison population.
“South Dakota can still be tough on crime, but we can strike a balance by giving another chance to the men that really have changed their lives,” Schwebach said. 
Bob Schatz, a former inmate who left the prison system in 2014, also focused on issues outside of building needs. He had several ideas for reducing the number of inmates who fail upon release and wind up back in the system.

Perhaps the simplest, Schatz suggested, would be to expand the state’s drug court program to include parolees. Currently, all the drug court participants who get 18 months of intensive supervision and support for sobriety are probationers, working their way through the program to avoid a prison sentence. 
Opening up such a program for parolees would help set more of them up for long-term success, he said.
“Six in 10 people complete that program,” Schatz said.
Pam Pakieser of Sioux Falls also spoke of her time in the state’s prison system, several decades ago at this point, and what’s helped her stay out. It wasn’t a parole officer or re-entry program, she said, but the kindness of volunteers and others willing to support her along the way.
Today, she tries to help others on the inside and their families. A loved one is currently imprisoned at the state penitentiary, she said, and fears for his safety in the face of repeated bouts of violence and the ensuing lockdowns.
A new building might be necessary, she said, but finding out the why behind the deteriorating security situation in the buildings the DOC should be just as serious a focus.
“We can put whatever we want on a pretty chart,” Pakieser said. “I would like people, mostly you people, to talk to the ones in the trenches to see what’s really going on.”
Sam Lint, a man serving a life sentence for first-degree murder, spoke into the microphone through the speaker of his mother’s phone.
Lint spent 14 years in the Jameson Annex of the Sioux Falls correctional campus unit before transferring to “the Hill,” the informal name for the 1881 penitentiary. The state “needs a new prison,” Lint said, but it also needs to find a way to better serve its inmates and protect correctional staff.
In the past three years, he said, life behind the walls has gotten more difficult, particularly for the majority of inmates who, unlike him, will be released into their communities eventually.
“What we have here are buildings full of classrooms that sit empty most of the time,” Lint said.

Defense lawyer, former warden: Consider more than one location
Ryan Kolbeck, a Sioux Falls defense lawyer, asked the work group to look beyond one Sioux Falls-area prison as a solution. 
His clients often struggle with addiction, Kolbeck said, and they have better chances in his city because there’s a better chance they’ll get a slot in treatment. 
He said the state ought to find ways to expand probation supervision and addiction treatment in rural areas so defendants there have as many chances to sidestep a prison sentence as those in Sioux Falls do. 
Ideally, Kolbeck said, a judge is able to deal with a defendant the way a parent deals with a child who spills milk: by giving them a chance to correct the problem. 
“When the kid cleans up the milk, there’s nothing for the parent to do,” Kolbeck said.

Kolbeck suggested smaller work release centers around the state, in addition to any higher-security facility. He pointed to Vermillion, where voters just approved a new jail and students at the University of South Dakota might partner with the Department of Corrections to help boost the number of inmates earning their high school diploma behind bars.
Earlier in the day, Corrections Secretary Kellie Wasko ran through slides showing how many of the 3,900 or so inmates in the state system had earned high school equivalency diplomas in the previous year.
Between male and female inmates, the number was 135. Just one was female, Wasko said, owing to the loss of an instructor for the program last year.
Kolbeck reacted strongly to those statistics.
“That’s embarrassing,” he said.
Darin Young was warden at the penitentiary until 2021. That year, he and a handful of other DOC employees were removed by the administration of then-Gov. Kristi Noem under allegations of nepotism and harassment that were never fully publicly explained and never resulted in criminal charges. Since then, four people have cycled through as Sioux Falls warden. Former Warden Teresa Bittinger resigned last fall, shortly after a weekslong lockdown that saw the complex’s sweat lodges dismantled in a search for contraband. 
The current warden, serving in an interim role, is Amber Pirraglia, who had been working as director of prisons until Bittinger’s departure.
On Thursday, Young told the prison reset group that the penitentiary could still safely house inmates if the state were to think beyond a single replacement for it. The DOC could build a floor onto the Jameson Annex, he suggested in a letter to the group. It could also put a new building on 28 acres of land it owns to the north of the penitentiary, build a smaller medium-security unit on state land near the Human Services Center in Yankton and take a handful of other steps to upgrade facilities across the system.
In his spoken testimony, Young reminded the group that lawmakers have set aside nearly $600 million for prisons in recent years. If the state’s going to spend that kind of money, Young said Thursday, “it has to be a home run.”

Arkansas is one of 13 states with an asset limit for SNAP recipients. Assets include cash on hand and in the bank, savings certificates and stocks and bonds, among other things.
Sen. Jonathan Dismang, R-Searcy, attempted in 2023 to raise the asset limit from $2,250 to $6,000 for Arkansans to qualify for Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) benefits. He and Rep. Jon Eubanks, R-Paris, are cosponsoring a bill this year with the same provision, and House Bill 1915 would also require the asset limit to be adjusted for inflation every two years. 
HB 1915 did not receive a vote Thursday after members of the House Public Health, Welfare and Labor Committee said they wanted clarity about how much the change would cost the state.
SNAP is entirely federally-funded with the exception of administrative costs, Department of Human Services Secretary Kristi Putnam said. Even so, Putnam said she opposed new changes to the SNAP asset limit while the state has not yet seen the impact of Act 675, the final version of Dismang’s 2023 bill.
Act 675 kept the $2,250 asset limit — which the federal government increased to $3,000 last year — but authorized a USDA waiver request to allow exemptions for individual families with more assets. Those families would have a new asset limit of $5,500 and remain enrolled in SNAP as long as they receive an exemption within a year of exceeding the current limit, and they would only be allowed one exemption every five years. HB 1915 would repeal this provision and replace it with the $6,000 asset limit.
Gov. Sarah Huckabee Sanders signed Act 675 after it had been amended twice. The original version would have raised the SNAP asset limit to $12,500, but Sanders said she opposed “expanding welfare,” even after Dismang reduced the proposed limit to $6,000.

Advocates for child well-being call for removal of barriers to Arkansas SNAP participation


Earlier on Thursday, the Arkansas Legislative Council’s Executive Subcommittee approved an emergency rule to amend DHS’ SNAP Certification Manual with the requirements put forth in Act 675.
When asked why the policy took two years to enact, Putnam told the subcommittee that DHS “made it more complicated than it needed to be.”
Act 675 and the new emergency rule allow families who qualify for the Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF) program to also qualify for SNAP. Arkansas Advocates for Children and Families expressed support for this policy change in a January report that called for the state to remove barriers to SNAP qualification and enrollment.
DHS Division of County Operations Director Mary Franklin told lawmakers in January that enacting Act 675 did not require a USDA waiver as stated in the law, but the department needed to ensure it had the funding to enact the policy.
Dismang said at the time that he was “disappointed” that Act 675 had not been implemented at all in two years. He repeated this statement in an interview Thursday.
 Committee debate

Eubanks similarly expressed disappointment with the lack of action on HB 1915. He told the Public Health committee that he had been under the impression DHS was neutral on the bill.
“How long are we supposed to wait?” Eubanks said. “I believe we need to move forward on this.”
Republican Reps. Jeremy Wooldridge of Marmaduke and Cameron Cooper of Romance said they were sympathetic to the intent of HB 1915 but wanted to know the fiscal impact of the bill before voting on it.
Putnam said DHS will examine income trends and try to project how many people will remain on SNAP longer under a $6,000 asset limit.
She said DHS will have the fiscal impact report ready by Monday, and committee vice chair Wooldridge said members will vote on the bill Tuesday.

The bill would have to advance with no roadblocks or amendments in order to reach Sanders’ desk by the end of the legislative session on April 16, Dismang said.
He also said potential fiscal impact should not be an issue, not only because SNAP is federally funded but also because allowing SNAP recipients to collect more assets while enrolled in the program “should eliminate some of the turnover that may be occurring right now, so there may actually be a decrease in the demand that’s getting placed on DHS.”
“I sure wish they were as diligent running impact [statements] on this as they are with some other bills that have run through the session,” Dismang said.
If HB 1915 does not clear the Legislature by April 16, Dismang said he is willing to try again in 2027, but there might be some ways to address the asset limit “that do not require legislation” in the meantime.
In addition to Putnam, Opportunity Arkansas CEO Nicholas Horton spoke against HB 1915, saying it would keep low-income people reliant on government aid.
Arkansas Hunger Relief Alliance Advocacy Director Lance Whitney disputed Horton’s statements while speaking in favor of HB 1915. He said most SNAP beneficiaries are only enrolled in the program for 18 to 22 months on average.
“We are currently looking at seniors, veterans and households who are looking for the ladder to get out of the hole… to get out of these safety net programs, but they need to have the rungs on the ladder to reach that,” Whitney said.

Ed Byrne said on Thursday.
The Bigfork legislator’s bill isn’t that way anymore and has become a property tax option for the Montana Legislature.
“It was beautiful, because nobody in the House knew it was coming, except the coalitions we built around it,” Byrne said in an interview with the Daily Montanan. “So the support I had throughout the whole thing, building at this for two months to get the votes.”
HB 528 drops agricultural land to a property tax rate of 1.7% from 2.61%, while residential properties less than $1.5 million would be taxed at 0.76%, currently at 1.35%.
Residential property at more than $1.5 million would be taxed at 1.35% and commercial property in Class 4 would be taxed at 1.35%. Currently, residential property more than $1.5 million and commercial property in Class 4 are taxed at 1.89%.
Two major property tax bills — House Bill 231 and House Bill 154 — were tabled in the Senate Taxation Committee on Wednesday as debate continues on a fix for homeowners across the state.
HB 528 has bipartisan support, and Byrne, a Republican, worked with Sen. Mary Ann Dunwell, D-Helena, on the legislation. It passed 12-11 out of the appropriations committee on Tuesday.
It previously passed the House on a 88-9 vote on March 21.
Byrne’s bill adjusts property tax rates on agricultural, residential and “Main Street” commercial properties, Dunwell said. It’s similar to SB 189, which was brought by Dunwell and tabled in the Senate Taxation Committee on April 1.
The hope was that either Byrne’s or Dunwell’s bill would gain traction in the Legislature.
“And at the end, if it’s not the vehicle, which it very well may not be, at least the meat of it would be in there, because our bills were simple, no complications,” Dunwell said.
Dunwell also said their bills could be implemented immediately, giving Montanans access to property tax relief sooner.
Byrne stressed the bipartisan nature of the legislation, noting how he watched then-speaker Sen. Matt Reiger, a Republican, work with Democrats, Rep. Mary Caferro and then minority leader Kim Abbott, last session, as they worked on problems they had with the Governor’s budget.
“When you can work bipartisan on the budget issues, you still don’t agree on the social, moral issues, you’ve got to put all that aside,” Byrne said. “It’s not personal, and you come in to fix what’s right on fiscal and taxes. And our biggest mandate here was taxes.”
  ‘It’s not over ‘til it’s over’ 

HB 231, brought by Rep. Llew Jones, R-Conrad, would have shifted some of the tax burden onto those who are not residents of the state, but own property in Montana. 
Jones called HB 528 the “preferred bill for implementing tax cuts” in an email to lobbyists on March 28. The bill also ran into trouble in Billings and Sunburst.
During the bill’s Senate hearing, Billings officials said HB 231 would shrink the tax base by about 12%. 
Sunburst and Billings have a unique charter, which has specific stipulations around how many mills they can levy without voter approval. Leaders there say they would have to go back to voters in their towns to raise taxes for critical services, like police and fire.
HB 231 was supported by Republican Gov. Greg Gianforte, and the legislation came to be known as the “Homestead bill.” Gianforte said he was disappointed in the tabling of the legislation, “the fairest approach,” during a Thursday press conference.
“It’s not over till it’s over, but we collectively, including myself and the legislature, we can’t leave here without implementing permanent property tax relief for the people of Montana,” Gianforte said.
HB 154, brought by Rep. Jonathan Karlen, D-Missoula, was a tax credit seeking to give direct help to renters and middle class property tax payers. HB 231 and HB 154 were both tabled.
“So, of course, it’s disappointing, but tabling a bill is not permanent,” Karlen said. “We take bills off the table all the time. We can blast bills in the Senate. So by no means I view it as the end of the line.”
Republicans have also brought a steady flow of rebate bills. Those aren’t the whole answer, Karlen said.
“My take on a rebate is that it’s like putting a band aid on a very deep wound that needs surgery,” Karlen said. “And so I think that any place for rebates should be to augment structural tax reform.”
Senate Bill 90, brought by Sen. Carl Glimm, R-Kila, sought to use lodging and rental car tax revenues to provide relief, but was tabled in the House Taxation Committee on Thursday morning.
Other property tax bills have also been discussed. Sen. Daniel Zolnikov, R-Billings, has SB 117, which puts limits on what government property tax increases local municipalities can do and changes the inflation limitation for calculating property tax levies.
Both bills were cited by Senate President Matt Reiger as part of the solution for property tax relief. However, Reiger also said two bills from Sen. Greg Hertz, R-Polson — SB 204 and SB 205 — would have completed the needed fix. SB 204 failed on a third reading in the Senate and SB 205 was indefinitely postponed.

“It was always going to be difficult, because anything that we do in Montana is just shifting taxes from one taxpayer to another,” Hertz said to the Daily Montanan. “And that’s a very difficult thing for anybody to raise somebody else’s taxes.”",https://dailymontanan.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/GettyImages-652093876-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-04-03 22:03:59.179055

(Pat Sutphin for the Idaho Capital Sun)Editor’s note: A previous related article on the bill passing the Idaho Senate was mistakenly removed from the Idaho Capital Sun’s website Thursday afternoon. This article includes information from that article, and the bill’s House passage.
In one day, the Idaho House and Senate floors widely passed a bill to let ivermectin be sold as an over-the-counter medicine.
Typically used to treat parasites in humans, ivermectin has drawn interest since the COVID pandemic — after largely conservative activists, doctors and politicians inaccurately touted it as an alternative medicine. 
The U.S. Food and Drug and Administration, or FDA, hasn’t approved ivermectin to treat or prevent COVID-19, saying the federal agency finds existing clinical trial data don’t show “ivermectin is effective against COVID 19 in humans.”
Idaho’s Senate Bill 1211 would let ivermectin be sold over-the-counter, without a prescription or consultation with a health care professional.
Supporters argue making ivermectin more widely available for human use would avoid people buying versions of the drug intended for animals, and it would make human use safer by providing more information on appropriate doses. 
Idaho lawmakers didn’t hear public feedback on the bill from doctors, pharmacists or health care professionals.
In arguments supporting the bill, Idaho Republican lawmakers often leaned into national rhetoric that inaccurately suggests ivermectin is a medical cure-all drug. That portrayal conflicts with national medical guidance that supports ivermectin in limited applications.
Dr. Sky Blue, who works with ivermectin in his practice as an infectious disease doctor in Idaho, told the Idaho Capital Sun the bill is part of a broader trend to promote unproven medical remedies and disregard their risks — over more proven treatments. 
“We have had very well done, well-executed and favorable clinical trials showing that paxlovid, molnupiravir and remdesivir have positive effects (as anti-viral COVID treatments),” Blue said in a Tuesday interview. “And all the studies with ivermectin have not shown to have benefit,” adding that severe toxicities have been found in ivermectin’s COVID use. 
Rep. Faye Thompson, R-McCall, said she recently went to a local feed store hoping to buy ivermectin for herself and her family to use, but stopped out of confusion over the appropriate dose. 
Usually, the FDA handles whether drugs should be made available over-the-counter, a process that uses data on safety and effectiveness.

 In the House, only 1 lawmaker voted against the bill. Several Democrats supported it. 

On Thursday, the bill cleared both chambers of the Idaho Legislature, which appears to be approaching the final days of its 2025 legislative session. 
In the Senate, the bill passed on a 25-9 vote. In the House, it passed with 66 votes in support and just a single vote in opposition: by Rep. Steve Berch, D-Boise. 
Debating in favor of the bill, Rep. John Gannon, D-Boise, drew a comparison with medical marijuana.
“It’s the same argument. … There are people who believe that it works, that it is a better way of dealing with pain,” he argued. 
The bill now heads to Idaho Gov. Brad Little for final consideration.

If Idaho’s ivermectin deregulation bill becomes law, it would take effect immediately — through an emergency clause.
When the bill is transmitted to the governor, he has five days, excluding Sundays, to decide on it. He has three options: sign it into law, allow it to become law without his signature, or veto it.
The bill is cosponsored by the top Republicans in the Idaho House and Senate — Senate President Pro Tempore Kelly Anthon, R-Rupert and House Speaker Mike Moyle, R-Star — along with two other lawmakers: Sen. Tammy Nichols, R-Middleton, and Rep. Jordan Redman, R-Coeur d’Alene.

 Pharmacies won’t be ready, Idaho industry representative testifies

One of only two people to testify in support of the fast-moving bill, an Idaho pharmacy industry representative testified that without an over-the-counter label, pharmacies can’t sell ivermectin over the counter. 
The bill does not direct drug manufacturers to develop such a label, which could warn about the drug’s risks if used in too high of doses, or ivermectin’s interactions with other medications. 
The FDA warns large doses of ivermectin “can be dangerous.” Overdoses can risk death, the federal regulator’s website says, and human-appropriate doses can interact with other medications, such as blood thinners. 
Two states allow ivermectin to be sold over-the-counter, according to local news reports: Arkansas passed a law this year, and Tennessee passed a law three years ago. North Carolina is considering a similar bill.
 Many Idaho Republican senators tap into ivermectin cure-all rhetoric — conflicting with medical guidance

When he pitched the bill in committee on Wednesday, bill cosponsor Anthon appeared to tap into the broader national rhetoric, saying ivermectin has been called a “wonder drug.”
“This is a drug that has had really immeasurable impacts on improving the lives of billions and billions of people throughout the world since it was discovered. It’s been called, in many places, a wonder drug,” Anthon, the top Idaho Senate Republican, told lawmakers in committee. “It’s been able to serve in treating and in many ways curing human diseases — treating parasites, worms in humans. And in most countries, it is legal over the counter.”
The Senate passed the bill on a 25-9 vote Thursday, sending the bill to the House. Five of the Senate’s six Democrats opposed the bill, joined by four Republicans; Democratic Sen. Ali Rabe, from Boise, was absent. 
 Sen. Tammy Nichols touts ivermectin as cure-all. Doctors, FDA disagree.

In opening arguments for the bill on the Senate floor, Nichols spoke for about seven minutes — out of the roughly 35-minute debate. 
She listed a range of ailments people have used ivermectin for.
“Some people will use it like taking vitamins,” Nichols told lawmakers.
Anthon has said the bill would mean people aren’t turning to veterinarian sources to find the drug, arguing patients could use it more safely with better dosing information.
Stressing he wasn’t a doctor or pharmacist, Sen. Kevin Cook, R-Idaho Falls, said the doctors and pharmacists he’d talked with say making ivermectin available without a prescription is “not a good idea because there is no testing yet. … We don’t know all the benefits or the faults of it.”

Debating in favor of the bill, Sen. Carl Bjerke, R-Coeur d’Alene, incorrectly claimed the FDA never fully approved a COVID vaccine.
“If we’re using the FDA as the benchmark for what’s approved or not approved, if you trust that, I believe that — I don’t think the COVID shot ever got out of emergency use authorization. That was never approved by the FDA, as far as I’m concerned,” Bjerke told the Senate. 
In 2021, the FDA approved Pfizer-BioNTech’s mRNA vaccine — which was the first COVID vaccine to advance past emergency use authorization. 
 Some committee members worried about lack of doctor input

The lack of input from medical experts drew consternation from some lawmakers on the Senate State Affairs Committee, which spent about a half hour considering the bill on Wednesday.

In committee, Sen. Treg Bernt, R-Meridian, said he wanted to talk to a couple doctors about the bill. But he repeatedly suggested the bill’s risk wasn’t high.
“I’m not a tin-hat-wearing legislator. I’m not a conspiracy theorist. I think we’re going to be OK with ivermectin,” he said. “I’m not — certainly wouldn’t be against it, I guess. But I just … want to know more about it.”
On Thursday, Bernt voted for the bill on the Senate floor. 
The committee’s only Democrat, Sen. James Ruchti, D-Pocatello, said he’d oppose the bill. He said the drug is being politicized.
“Political reasons are not a good basis for making a decision to make a prescription drug an over-the-counter drug,” Ruchti said in committee. “That decision should be driven by the science. It should be driven by data and research. And we have none of that in front of us.”

The committee’s chairman, Sen. Jim Guthrie, R-McCannon, said he’d oppose the bill in committee but he might change his mind later.
His younger brother took ivermectin when he got COVID, and “he thought he was going to die,” Guthrie told the committee.
“Now, was that the ivermectin or advanced COVID? Who knows. But he felt like it could have very, very well been the ivermectin. Did he think that if a little’s good, a lot will do better? Possibly. And maybe that’s … the risk you take when you don’t have that consultation,” Guthrie said. 
Guthrie opposed the bill on the Senate floor, joined by four other Republican lawmakers: Sens. Van Burtenshaw, from Terreton; Cook; and Dave Lent, from Idaho Falls. 
 What the committee heard: Opposition from pharmacy industry representative, and support from attorney

Only two people testified on the bill:

Brian Festa, an attorney who is the co-founder of the nonprofit Caldwell-based public interest law firm We The Patriots USA. Saying he represented himself, Festa testified briefly in support of the bill. He referenced a lawsuit his law firm was involved in over a Minnesota patient’s struggle to get ivermectin as a need for the bill. 
And Pam Eaton, the CEO of the Idaho Retailers Association which represents Idaho pharmacies. In the past eight hours, she told the committee she’d heard from more pharmacists than she’d heard from throughout this year’s Idaho legislative session, adding that 99% of people she’d heard from were opposed to the bill. 

Eaton said without an over-the-counter label, pharmacies can’t sell ivermectin over-the-counter. Some might be able to, but she said most are saying they can’t.
Throughout her testimony, Eaton stressed she is not a pharmacist. But she relayed patient safety concerns she said she’d heard from a pharmacist about ivermectin.
“It has serious interactions with five medications, and requires close monitoring with 51 medications, including commonly used antibiotics, cholesterol, heart medications and other (over-the-counter) antihistamines,” Eaton said. 
That’s the sort of information that would be on an over-the-counter medication label, she added.

(Zach Wendling/Nebraska Examiner)LINCOLN — After anger, threats of stalling legislation and accusations of discrimination, the Unicameral on Thursday resurrected a priority bill by State Sen. Terrell McKinney to help keep at-risk youths out of jail. It’s now part of another proposal that advanced.
Earlier in the day, McKinney’s Legislative Bill 48 was doused on a 22-14 vote. Eleven lawmakers marked present but not voting.
That led the North Omaha legislator to call opponents hypocrites. He said they claim to “care about kids” but are more interested in “keeping up with the status quo” and “keeping black kids in the system.”
 ‘Because he is Black or a Democrat’ 

His priority bill calls for an around-the-clock Family Resource and Juvenile Assessment Center pilot program in Omaha. The goal is two sites that address family dynamics, mental health, substance abuse and educational challenges contributing to juvenile delinquency.
  State Sen. Machaela Cavanaugh of Omaha. March 26, 2025. (Zach Wendling/Nebraska Examiner)
The effort would integrate “culturally relevant services delivered by and for the communities served.” Subject to available funds, up to $1 million annually for five years would come from a Medicaid cash fund.
State Sen. Machaela Cavanaugh of Omaha, after the earlier vote that sank LB 48, promised not to sit down until lawmakers “fixed” the McKinney situation. She said she believed opponents have been unfairly dismissing his ideas.
“I don’t know if it’s because he is Black or a Democrat,” Cavanaugh said, imploring certain colleagues to “have a frickin’ backbone.”
During later debate on a different bill, State Sen. Danielle Conrad of Lincoln helped revive McKinney’s pilot program. The rescue came in the form of a floor amendment attached to an aging services-related proposal championed by State Sen. Glen Meyer of Pender.
Meyer’s LB 382, which had seen little opposition, proposes to direct $4 million over two years from a Medicaid cash fund to keep afloat activities and services offered by the state’s eight designated agencies for the aging. That includes nutritional programs such as Meals-On-Wheels.
The floor amendment that revived McKinney’s pilot program passed 27-7, picking up six new Republican votes and losing one from State Sen. Stan Clouse of Kearney.

Four of those six additions had sat out the first vote — Speaker John Arch of La Vista and State Sens. Myron Dorn of Adams, Jana Hughes of Seward and Mike Jacobson of North Platte — while the other two, State Sens. Mike Moser of Columbus and Dave Wordekemper of Fremont, originally voted “no.”
Meyer’s revised LB 382, including McKinney’s proposal, moved on to the next phase of debate with a 37-2 vote. 
Meyer, a member of the Legislature’s Health and Human Services Committee, was part of the group that advanced McKinney’s pilot program bill out of committee and onto debate. But after that he voted twice against it, including when it was being attached to his LB 382.
 ‘Unnecessary bureacracy’ 

State Sen. Merv Riepe of Ralston was among those who remained opposed to the McKinney pilot program partly because of its cost. He also said Omaha has various nonprofits devoted to youths that already seek to curb juvenile delinquency.
Sen. Kathleen Kauth of Omaha, another opponent, said she’d prefer to see a comprehensive assessment of all Omaha-area programs available for at-risk youth. She views the McKinney-backed Family Resource and Juvenile Assessment pilot program as “unnecessary bureaucracy.”
Sen. John Cavanaugh of Omaha called it “foolish” not to embrace programs that intervene in a youth’s life on the front end rather than pay back end costs such as incarceration.
  State Sen. Merv Riepe of Ralston. Aug. 16, 2024. (Zach Wendling/Nebraska Examiner)
McKinney said his pilot program was supported by law enforcement groups with whom he is typically at odds. He said his priority bill was a preventative effort to provide mentoring, mental health care, parenting and other support before youths sink into trouble.
It comes at a time when other public officials, including Riepe and Gov. Jim Pillen, are pushing to lower the age at which youth offenders can be detained and charged as adults. Riepe’s priority bill, LB 556, would lower the age at which a Nebraska youth could be detained for an alleged crime from 13 to 11, and it would drop the age at which a minor could be charged as an adult for the “most serious” felonies from 14 to 12.
McKinney argues adamantly that the Legislature should be doing more to prevent youths from going down the wrong path, one he said costs taxpayers more.

At a brief meeting of the Montana Board of Regents this week, Chairman Todd Buchanan said “enthusiasm was palpable” during a visit last week by two finalists for “clearly one of the more important jobs in the state.”
The finalists include a former dean at the University of Montana.
“It was really exciting to see the quality of folks seeking this opportunity,” Buchanan said.
One finalist is Dr. Kurt Schnier, vice chancellor for planning and budget and the chief financial officer at the University of California, Merced, according to a news release from the MSU search committee. It said Schnier also is a professor of economics there.
The other finalist is Dr. Brock Tessman, president of Northern Michigan University and former dean of the Davidson Honors College at the University of Montana in Missoula. The news release said Tessman also has been an associate professor and assistant professor at the University of Georgia’s Department of International Affairs. He also served as served as the Deputy Commissioner of Higher Education overseeing the 16 campuses that comprise the Montana University System.
In August 2024, MSU President Waded Cruzado announced she would retire in June 2025 after 15 years in the role. MSU is the largest public institution in the state of Montana.
In an email Thursday, Galen Hollenbaugh, with the Office of the Commissioner of Higher Education, said a decision should be made soon, although a timeline isn’t set.
“The Montana State University Presidential Search Advisory Committee and the Board of Regents are moving closer to a decision, but the process is ongoing and the timeline for an announcement remains in flux,” Hollenbaugh said.
The Board of Regents went into a closed, executive session after a brief update of the search process to discuss the finalists.
“We have determined that the discussion of the finalists involves individual privacy rights that outweigh the public’s right to know, and we are closing the session to ensure confidentiality,” Buchanan said.
Buchanan said the visits by the top two candidates came after a “robust and thoughtful vetting process,” which included numerous interviews. He said on campus, both finalists met with staff, faculty, students, alumni and the public.

(Photo by Hal Bernton)The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration has long struggled to compete with corporate America to recruit tech workers to maintain the complicated computer systems that track the federal seafood harvests off Alaska.
These chronic staffing shortages at NOAA Fisheries’ Alaska Region have been greatly exacerbated by the Trump administration’s efforts to cut the federal workforce.
As of mid-March, the Alaska Region had 29% of its staffing positions vacant, and the Information Services Division, staffed largely by tech workers, had a vacancy rate of 45%, according to an internal agency memorandum obtained by the Alaska Beacon.
The memorandum offers a window into the impacts of the Trump administration downsizing campaign on the agency’s Alaska Region, which plays a vital role in overseeing federal harvests in a nearly 1.5 million square mile swath of the North Pacific that produce about half of the fish caught in U.S. waters. The memorandum states that the region is “evaluating core functions necessary to maintain minimal functionality to keep the fisheries operating…we are aligning existing staffing resources to maintain and ‘keep the lights on.’ “
That task will likely become more challenging in the weeks ahead.
NOAA Fisheries is part of the Commerce Department, which has been instructed by a Trump executive order to shrink its federal workforce in a quest to “eliminate waste, bloat and insularity.”
Some NOAA Fisheries workers who had not completed a probationary period of employment already are off the job. They were let go earlier this year, then placed on paid administrative leave after a judge, in response to a lawsuit, found fault with that move.
Meanwhile, the Commerce Department is encouraging employees with long years of federal service to take early retirement. Others can leave and collect “lump sum” exit payments of up to $25,000, according to a copy of the NOAA offer obtained by the Beacon. Employees have until April 17 to decide whether they want to leave NOAA Fisheries voluntarily. If they do not, they will still face the risk of getting laid off at a later date by a reduction in force, according to the offer. As the deadline for voluntary departures approaches, staff members say that morale has eroded. Some who had considered staying are opting to leave as they confront expanded workloads with less support. Three current federal workers who spoke with the Alaska Beacon declined to comment publicly due to concerns about retaliation, but said that there was fear among frontline workers and one worker said that extended to leadership.
The responsibilities of the NOAA Fisheries Alaska region include enforcement of the Marine Mammal Protection Act, marine conservation, and collecting and managing catch data. The regional offices also work closely with the Alaska Fisheries Science Center, which is charged with carrying out much of the fishery survey work and also has been slammed by staff losses.
The Trump administration cuts to NOAA Fisheries alarm Bill Tweit, vice chair of the North Pacific Fishery Management Council, a federal advisory group that develops harvest policies for the 200-mile U.S. fishery zone off Alaska.  As climate change intensifies, the council faces an increasingly challenging task of helping to manage the fisheries. And if Alaska staff cuts substantially weaken NOAA Fisheries’ scientific capabilities, then he expects the council may consider tighter harvest limits.
“‘That’s because the less information we have – the more conservative we have to be,” said Tweit, a Washington state Department of Fish and Wildlife official who has served on the council for almost two decades.

Sources within the Alaska regional office say some of the  greatest concern is focused on the Alaska Region’s Information Services Division. The division staff support an aging computer system, and   “Development work to improve our IT (Information Technology) systems is particularly at risk,” said the Alaska Region internal memorandum, which stated that the division’s vacancy rate will soon reach 55%.
The computer division tracks the progress of a multitude of harvests, along with the bycatch of accidentally caught species. Accurate tallying of the rapidly changing harvest totals is essential to preventing overfishing in derby-style fisheries, such as the Gulf of Alaska pollock harvest,  which have boat crews who race to grab as much fish as possible before a fleet-wide quota is reached. 
In a public document filed March 28 with the North Pacific Fishery Management Council, the Alaska Region listed eight of the staff who were “lost,” including two supervisors and a  software developer from the Information Services Division.

	During a Thursday meeting of the North Pacific Fishery Management Council, NOAA Alaska Regional Administrator Jon Kurland did not disclose any details about the vacancy rates but acknowledged  “some very challenging circumstances.” 
“This will be a new paradigm, less staff and less capacity,” Kurland said in testimony to the council. “I can say we will have limitations and delays in delivering things that council and stakeholders are expecting…. Our staff have been under quite a lot of stress, and they have really been touched by numerous, very kind acknowledgements of their public service.”
In later remarks to the council, Kurland said “we are expecting to see some further big changes, and those changes will have impacts on the services that we can provide. But…. I really can’t go into any more detail than that at this point.
Also on Thursday, Bob Foy, director of the Alaska Fisheries Science Center, testified to the council. He noted staff losses, travel restrictions and an effort to keep “any of the core balls from being dropped.”
“That’s really the space we are in right now. A heck of a lot of uncertainty,” Foy said.

(Photo by Robin Opsahl/Iowa Capital Dispatch)The Iowa Senate Education Committee advanced a number of bills impacting both K-12 and higher education on Thursday, ensuring they will remain active as the session’s second funnel deadline looms.
Sen. Lynn Evans, R-Aurelia, said during the committee meeting the group will have one more meeting early next week, but will focus on appointments instead of policy.
K-12 education
The first bill discussed during committee, and one of the most contested of the day, was House File 884, which would allow public and nonpublic school districts to bring in a chaplain to work with students. It states in the legislation that schools cannot “require or coerce a student to utilize” chaplains’ services and bars chaplains from being used as guidance counselors.
An amendment from Sen. Sarah Trone Garriott, D-West Des Moines, to prohibit chaplains from proselytizing on school grounds, failed. Sen. Mike Pike, R-Des Moines, floor manager for the bill, submitted an amendment to require chaplains be mandatory reporters and “have a certification from a nationally recognized school Chaplain professional credentializing organization,” he said, which passed.
Senate democrats voiced concerns about the amendment limiting who would be allowed to work with a district as a chaplain, with Trone Garriott saying the only organization providing the necessary credentials is a Christian advocacy group that would not allow those who don’t follow its goals to receive credentials.
“State sanctioned Christian indoctrination,” said Sen. Sen. Molly Donahue, D-Cedar Rapids. “That’s what this is about.”

Once passed, the bill as a whole also caused worries for Trone Garriott and others. She said being a chaplain is hard work that is not for everyone, and this legislation would allow “untrained, unvetted, unsupervised individuals” into their children’s schools and gives them a title and authority.
“It is a groomer’s dream to have access to our children this way, to have this authority, and then to be able to come in and operate with no guidance and no guidelines and no oversight,” Trone Garriott said.
Pike said the bill would give control back to local school districts, and to the communities within them, to decide for themselves whether they’d like to have a chaplain working with students.
“If the parents and the district chooses not to be involved with the chaplains, then they’re not going to be,” Pike said. “But if the district chooses so, then they will, with the agreement of the parents. The parents always have a say in their school board.”
House File 785 would modify rules for charter school boards to allow no more than one board member to reside outside of Iowa, but would require that all members be U.S. citizens.
Sens. Mike Zimmer and Herman Quirmbach expressed concerns that allowing people living outside of the state could take control away from the people who utilize the school.
“I do believe that one individual from outside of the state sitting on that board could have an undue influence,” Zimmer said.
Sen. Jesse Green, R-Boone, said in closing comments the legislation will be useful to the charter schools located close to Iowa’s borders. There are no such constraints in place for nonprofit boards, he added, calling into question why school boards should need one.
“There’s only three states right now that have restrictions on board memberships, and so we’re pretty unique in that we’re requiring only in-state board memberships,” Green said.
The committee moved the legislation ahead with a vote of 11 to 5.
House File 189 would set requirements for public school districts with nonpublic school students wishing to participate in extracurricular athletics. Sen. Tim Kraayenbrink, R-Fort Dodge, said it would require school districts to allow students living in the district but attending a nonpublic school to participate in athletics provided by the district but not the nonpublic school in the past two years.
Trone Garriott called the legislation a “one-way bill,” as it does not allow students from public schools to join sports only offered by the nonpublic school in the district.
“It’s really inappropriate that even though we’re funding both school systems, only one student gets to pick and choose from all of the available opportunities while our public school students are shut out,” Trone Garriott said. “This is inherently unfair.”
The legislation passed with an 11-5 vote.
Four pieces of legislation were passed unanimously during the committee meeting, aimed at making those allowed to direct students with concussions to sit out of activities and school district budgets more flexible.
House File 471 would add those with a doctorate in psychology and specialized training in concussion management or neuropsychology to the category of licensed health professionals who can direct a student to be removed from an extracurricular activity due to showing signs or symptoms of a concussion or brain injury.
House File 579 would allow the modified supplemental amount ratio school districts can levy for dropout prevention programs to go up to 5%, Sen. Tom Shipley, R-Nodaway, said, if approved at an election. It cannot increase by more than .5% every fiscal year.
House File 316 would make changes to career education and exploration in K-12 schools, Evans said, including expanding career planning curriculum to fifth and sixth grades and adding additional criteria for career education in seventh and eighth grades.
The bill would also have the Iowa Department of Education form a list of industry recognized credentials, create a seal and provide it to schools to add onto student transcripts and other documents if they have earned a credential before graduating.
House File 315 would make school districts impacted by a natural disaster eligible for an additional year of budget guarantees, Evans said. No districts would have need of this adjustment the majority of the time, he said, but it would help those who have.
Sen. Cindy Winckler, D-Davenport, said the bill needs to move forward and urged its adoption. A similar version of the House bill, Senate File 64, has been assigned a subcommittee in the Senate Ways and Means Committee.
Higher Education
House File 295 would prohibit higher education accrediting bodies from taking negative actions against state universities and community colleges for following, or refusing to violate, state law, like eliminating diversity, equity and inclusion programming that an accreditor may require.
If an accreditor does take an action against an Iowa university, the institution can seek authorization from the Iowa attorney general to file a civil suit against the body.
Winckler and Quirmbach pointed out the removal of any mention of the Higher Learning Commission, an accrediting body they said provides accreditation to 51 colleges and universities in Iowa, from the legislation, and said taking it out allows for universities to use lower-quality accreditors.
“I can’t support the bill. I think it dumbs down our higher education system,” Winckler said. “I think that with the possible elimination of the U.S. Department of Education, it puts us and any of our higher learning institutions in a very precarious situation.”
Sen. Kerry Gruenhagen, R-Walcott, agreed with Winckler that accreditation is important, and added that this bill will protect it. Names in the bill aren’t important, he said, as new accreditors may come down the line later on.
It passed 11-5 and will head to the Senate calendar for debate.
House File 401 would set new general education requirements for Iowa’s public universities, mandating a certain number of credit hours be taken in English, math and statistics, American and western heritage, natural and social sciences and the humanities.
While the bill states instructors’ academic freedoms and the freedom to discuss ideas in the classroom will not be infringed upon, it also states general education courses cannot “distort significant historical events or include any curriculum or other material that teaches identity politics or is based on theories that systemic racism, sexism, oppression, or privilege are inherent in the institutions of the United States of America or the state of Iowa.”
Lawmakers said in a subcommittee meeting Wednesday they anticipate amendments will need to be added to the legislation.
Quirmbach said universities are perfectly able to set their own standards for general education, and the Legislature would probably do a much worse job at it. Echoing comments he made in the subcommittee meeting, he said including “identity politics” without a definition would throw educators into “complete chaos.”
He would also like to know what is expected to be excluded from education due to the section about systemic oppression, bringing up slavery and its inclusion in the Constitution as an example.
“Our history is one of institutions that have supported sexism and racism, oppression and privilege, and if we are going to require a course on American heritage, we cannot, we cannot, honestly avoid those topics,” Quirmbach said.
If the argument from the subcommittee persists that the language is in the present rather than the past tense, Quirmbach said it could then bar instructors from speaking about the Legislature removing transgender protections from Iowa Civil Rights code this session.
Sen. Jeff Taylor, R-Sioux Center, provided his own definition of “identity politics” — “identity politics politicizes certain demographic traits, thereby defining people by their sex, race, sexual orientation and so on, and prioritizing public policy issues on that basis.”
While there were systems of sexism, racism and oppression in the U.S. 200 years ago, Taylor said that is not the case today and that is why it is barred in the bill.
“I’m not saying that there isn’t racism, that there isn’t sexism, that there isn’t oppression or privilege — all of those things still exist, but they are not institutionalized,” Taylor said.
The bill passed with an 11-5 vote.
House File 440 would direct the state higher education system to study the pros and cons of implementing a tuition freeze for first-year students so they won’t see increases during their first four years of study, as well as set tuition prices for the upcoming year by April 30.
Universities would also be required to develop three-year baccalaureate degree programs and work study programs for students working part-time while attending classes paid for by their employer.
An amendment introduced by Quirmbach to provide an exception to the April 30 deadline if the Legislature has not yet approved higher education appropriations failed to pass.
Green thanked Rep. Taylor Collins, R-Mediapolis, for his work on the bill in his closing comments, and it moved ahead to the Senate calendar.
House File 856 would bar state entities from spending any money, from public funding or otherwise, on opening or maintaining DEI offices or officers. Community colleges are included in the legislation as well as private universities, who would risk Iowa Tuition Grant ineligibility if they do not comply.
Sen. Ken Rozenboom, R-Oskaloosa, introduced an amendment to strike the division dealing with private universities from the legislation, which passed unanimously.
Quirmbach and Zimmer reiterated concerns during the meeting they expressed on the Senate Floor during debate on Senate File 507. Zimmer said the use of the word “promote” could bar local and state government departments from encouraging good initiatives aimed at getting more women into male-dominated fields, and Quirmbach said entities could potentially be stopped from celebrating Black History Month and other established events.
“This bill, more than anything else I think, suppresses freedom of free speech, it suppresses freedom of opinion…,” Quirmbach said. “It’s one of the saddest pieces of legislation I’ve seen coming along.”
Rozenboom said this legislation is in line with others considered last session, and it “addresses a problem that needs to be addressed.” While the definition of DEI in the bill is a wide-ranging one, and one he said that is “what you make of it,” but added it is well thought-out and gets to the core of the issue he sees.
“It is not the proper place of a state entity to promote ideologies and opinions as their official role,” Rozenboom said.
The legislation passed with an 11-5 vote.

Free.,"U.S. Senate GOP moves ahead with budget resolution, setting up final vote this weekend",Jennifer Shutt,,,,,https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/us-senate-gop-moves-ahead-budget-resolution-setting-final-vote-weekend,,"WASHINGTON — U.S. Senate Republicans on Thursday advanced a budget resolution that, once approved by both chambers of Congress, will pave the way for trillions of dollars in tax and spending cuts.The 52-48 vote moved senators one step closer to a marathon amendment voting session, which will likely take place Friday or Saturday, before they give the budget their final stamp of approval. Kentucky Republican Sen. Rand Paul was the only member of his party to vote against moving forward.The House will have to vote to adopt the revised budget resolution in order to unlock the complex reconciliation process that GOP leaders plan to use to enact an extension of the 2017 tax law, hundreds of billions in new funding for border security and defense, and substantial cuts to federal spending.The compromise budget resolution, released Wednesday, will also clear the way for Republicans to raise the debt limit later this year by between $4 and $5 trillion.The tax-and-spending blueprint is not a bill and never goes to the president for a signature. It’s what’s known as a concurrent resolution, so only the House and Senate need to approve it for its provisions to take effect.Once GOP lawmakers do that, they can move their sweeping policy goals through the Senate without garnering the support of at least 60 lawmakers to move past the legislative filibuster.That means GOP leaders won’t need to negotiate any part of the yet-to-be-drafted reconciliation bill with Democrats, only the various factions that make up the party.But that will prove a challenging task given their especially narrow majorities.In the House, there are only 220 GOP members at the moment, a much smaller number than when the original tax law package passed during Trump’s first administration.Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., can only lose three Republicans on partisan bills if all members of the chamber are voting. There are currently two absences, but if that changes before Congress clears the bill, Johnson’s margins might shift slightly.Republicans hold 53 seats in the Senate and can lose only three members on the reconciliation package, if Vice President J.D. Vance is available to break a tied vote.",,,,2025-04-03 20:02:46.120772

Much of the discussion around the resolution centered on whether to delay a vote on the controversial proposal made by board member Christina Boggess. There were questions about specific examples of Utah schools not complying with a 2024 law restricting DEI efforts in all public institutions, and also whether a rule, and not a resolution, would be a more appropriate path to eliminate DEI programs. 
LeAnn Wood, a board member who supported postponing the discussion indefinitely, said she worried about the hundreds of calls and emails she received from constituents in her district about the resolution. That much angst, she said, indicates something is not right.

“I don’t think a resolution is the answer. If we need to define what compliance looks like, then we need to do that,” she said. “We need to do our job. We do not need a political statement of what we think should be happening.”
Boggess, however, pushed back against an indefinite postponement.
“I think we’re giving the proverbial middle finger to the Legislature,” Boggess said. “I think we’re giving the proverbial middle finger to our federal agencies who have spoken very boldly on these issues and have asked us to address them.” 
Utah State Board of Education to consider resolution tying DEI programs to communist goals 

The draft, which had been controversial among Utahns for tying DEI programs to communist goals, was updated to eliminate references to communism and to make distinctions for special education programs, among other provisions. But, ultimately, like all of the proposed actions to postpone the discussion, the resolution failed.
A couple of members from Latinos in Action, a nonprofit that offers a year-long elective course aimed to bridging opportunity and graduation gaps for Latino students, spoke against the resolution during the meeting’s public comment section. 
Christian Hernandez, a social studies teacher, highlighted how immigrants have vastly contributed to innovation in the country and why programs like Latinos in Action are necessary to provide leadership tools and academic support for students who may feel overlooked. 
“The notion that programs like (Latinos in Action) are Soviet style is divisive and misleading,” Hernandez said. “Programs like this embody the very spirit of America, and how we can become leaders promoting progress and opportunity.”
  Utah State Board of Education votes on an anti-DEI resolution on April 3, 2025 (Alixel Cabrera/Utah News Dispatch)
Under Utah’s anti-DEI law, affinity and cultural groups in public institutions are still permitted as long as they don’t exclude anyone based on their race, color, ethnicity, sex, sexual orientation, national origin, religion or gender identity. However, according to Hernandez, the program would have to be eliminated if the resolution passed.
However, Boggess pointed to an addition to the draft made by Utah’s congressional delegation, she said: “Without a firm directive to comply with the Executive Order, the State of Utah stands to lose Federal Funding for education,” the newest version of the resolution states.
And, she said the resolution had to be considered seriously, since she’s personally aware of over 100 complaints of DEI violations in Utah schools made in a U.S. Department of Education online portal. 
Board members also raised other concerns about the resolution. 
“​​This appears to be a rule dressed as a resolution,” said member Joseph Kerry, questioning whether approving it would go against the board’s policies.
It would actually violate two of their policies, a member of the board’s legal counsel said — backing a resolution that mandates something to happen as if it were a rule, and the board’s policy on policies, which dictates that all board policies are binding. 
Should the U.S. Department of Education be dismantled? 
The majority of the board also voted against signing a letter of intent addressed to President Donald Trump, Secretary of Education Linda McMahon and the Utah congressional delegation to allow the state to manage federal dollars for education purposes.



Let us know what you think...


 


“I think there’s nothing wrong with us saying, ‘if you’re going this direction, we’ve got the qualifications to do this,’” member Jennie Earl said. “I think this also lets the legislature know we can do this.”
But, that proposal also failed despite some attempts to make it shorter and “less disparaging” to federally-managed programs, according to board member Carol Lear. 
But, still, after the Utah Legislature rejected to fund some items the board deemed important for Utah students, many of the members said they don’t trust the state to protect some programs that are managed at the federal level.
Lear cited programs like Utah Fits All, the school voucher program that the state’s largest teacher union is challenging in court for its constitutionality, and a 2025 bill that — before it was vetoed — would have rerouted property tax revenue for schools into the state general fund. 
She also fears for programs like the McKinney-Vento Homeless Assistance Act, which provides students experiencing homelessness with equal access to public education.
“That’s not going to be a popular use of funds for either the state or for individual LEAs, so I am one very grateful person that those children are served directly by federal regulations,” Lear said.
Other members, like Boggess, said that while they believe government is best when it is closer to the people, they still were skeptical about the move, especially because it would imply that the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services would take over Department of Education tasks 
“It presents this conundrum wherein we advocate for the abolition of an agency which only redirects to an agency that is not an expert in education,” Boggess said.

,DC,2025-04-03 23:19:42+00:00,News From The States - Fair. Fearless. Free.,"Contempt finding possible for Trump officials behind deportation flights, judge says",Ariana Figueroa,,,,,https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/contempt-finding-possible-trump-officials-behind-deportation-flights-judge-says,,"WASHINGTON — Judge James E. Boasberg on Thursday strongly implied there was probable cause that the Trump administration violated his orders over deportation flights carried out under the Alien Enemies Act of 1798.“It seems to me ... that the government acted in bad faith throughout that day,” he said of March 15, when the administration sent three flights of Venezuelan nationals to a notorious El Salvador mega-prison and seemingly defied his order to return them.“If you believed everything you did was legal, I can't believe you would have operated the way you did that day,” Boasberg said to Drew Ensign, a deputy assistant attorney general who is representing the administration in the case.An order of contempt could come as soon as next week, Boasberg said. He said if he finds the government in contempt, there would be hearings to determine the official, or officials, who defied his order and the possible consequences of those actions.Contempt would allow Boasberg to issue a fine against certain officials in order to force compliance or he even to order U.S. marshals to jail an official.During Thursday's hearing, Boasberg questioned why the proclamation was signed “in secret,” noting it was put into use before a judge could review it.“Is there any other inference (than) that there was an expedited effort to get people on planes…before my hearing,” Boasberg asked, referring to a March 15 hearing that ended with the judge placing the temporary restraining order blocking the use of the law.For more than an hour Thursday, Boasberg grilled Ensign about the timing of three deportation flights after the wartime law was invoked.In the order, Boasberg also required the return of any mid-air flights to the U.S.But rather than return the flights, the government delivered more than 261 men to a notorious mega-prison in El Salvador known as CECOT. Boasberg questioned Ensign on which government officials were aware his temporary restraining order was in place and asked for the name of the person who decided not to turn the flights around.Ensign said he was not sure and then cited attorney-client privileges, which Boasberg seemed skeptical about. Ensign then said he was not aware of who made the decision to not turn the flights around.The Trump administration has denied it violated any orders and has said that it followed the law.Contempt hearings possibleBoasberg asked American Civil Liberties Union attorney Lee Gelernt what process for a contempt finding they would recommend.Gelernt said having the government write sworn declarations answering pointed questions and having officials questioned under oath would be acceptable steps.“We feel the order was violated,” Gelernt said. ACLU has already filed for a preliminary injunction while the case proceeds.In the motion for a preliminary injunction, ACLU argued that the Trump administration’s use of the Alien Enemies Act violates administrative and immigration laws and constitutional rights to due process.“Plaintiffs will suffer severe and irreparable harm in the absence of a preliminary injunction, as demonstrated by class members who have already been removed and consigned to a life sentence in a Salvadoran prison without … notice or the opportunity to contest the government’s designation,” according to the brief.A hearing for a preliminary injunction is set for April 8.The Trump administration on March 28 made an emergency appeal to the U.S. Supreme Court to allow for deportations under the wartime law – something that until now, had only been used during wars: the War of 1812, World War I and World War II. A decision from the high court is expected soon.Seeking informationPresident Donald Trump has publicly attacked Boasberg, calling for his impeachment. The Justice Department has also tried to have Boasberg removed from the case.Attorney General Pam Bondi invoked the “state secrets privilege” late last month to refuse to answer Boasberg’s detailed questions about the flights.Boasberg rejected that argument in Thursday's hearing, asking Ensign if the information was classified.Ensign said it was not classified.Boasberg then questioned why the Trump administration refused to show him the information he was seeking, as is common in cases with sensitive information such as national security details.There are specific rooms called Sensitive Compartmented Information Facility, or SCIFs, where sensitive information can be discussed with officials, such as a federal judge.Boasberg said the administration was acting “pretty sketchily"" in not showing him the information. In various hearings, Boasberg has expressed doubt that the Trump administration can use the wartime law to deport Venezuelans accused of gang ties without due process. Boasberg has agreed that the president has broad authority over foreign policy and deportations, but has deemed deportations can’t be done without due process.Aside from determining if the Trump administration violated his restraining order with the deportation flights, Boasberg is trying to determine if the president violated the Alien Enemies Act by deporting Venezuelans without proper judicial review.Department of Justice attorneys have argued that those subject to the Alien Enemies Act do not need to be notified. Instead, they argue anyone subject to the proclamation who wants to challenge it can make a habeas corpus claim – that is, challenge the legality of their detentions.Flights to El SalvadorAt issue are three deportation planes that eventually went to the prison in El Salvador on March 15. Two of the planes left before Boasberg gave a verbal order to pause deportations under the Alien Enemies Act.One plane left after Boasberg issued a written order, but the Trump administration has said those on the third flight had removal orders under Title 8, not the wartime law.Ensign said the proclamation was signed on March 14, but didn’t go into effect until the next day.Boasberg questioned how U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement was able to have enough time to load up three planes and deport Venezuelans under the proclamation if they only knew about it that day.Ensign conceded that ICE likely was preparing for the proclamation ahead of time.“If that’s true, one could infer, they were working on the proclamation before it was public,” Boasberg said.Boasberg also noted public comments the president made, where Trump said he wasn’t sure who or when the proclamation was signed.Ensign said he had not seen the press conference during which the president made those remarks.Deportation errorsBoasberg questioned Ensign about who was notified when he first placed the temporary restraining order. Ensign stuttered and seemed uncomfortable, and said he could not remember. Boasberg gave him time to recall.Ensign listed off members of his DOJ team and points of contact at the State Department and the U.S. Department of Homeland Security.Boasberg again noted the “rushed” nature of the flights and how the government has erred in deporting people, including a Maryland father who originally from El Salvador who was sent to prison due to what ICE and DOJ have called an “administrative error.”Boasberg also noted that eight women and one Nicaraguan national were returned from the March 15 flights because the prison was only for men and El Salvador was only taking Venezuelans and their own nationals.Boasberg asked Ensign why the Trump administration would “risk putting people on these planes that should not be on (the) planes.”Ensign said he didn’t have specific operational details.Family members and attorneys for many of the men have disputed the Trump administration's claims that those taken to El Salvador were members of the Tren de Aragua. They claim the men were deported because ICE agents misinterpreted their tattoos. Many deportees had no criminal record and were in asylum hearings before an immigration judge, they added.",,,,2025-04-03 20:02:46.120772

Sam Zurier, a Providence Democrat, wants to radically revise the Crowley Act, which regulates school district takeovers in Rhode Island. The current law does not offer much detail on how the takeovers should operate. (Screengrab/CapitolTV)Providence’s public schools may remain under state control until 2027. Three senators who represent parts of the city want to change the state law that made the takeover possible.
The Crowley Act was first introduced in 1997 and lets the state education department seize control of underperforming school districts. The act’s sparse instructions for state intervention — about 380 words in all — is not exactly adored by present-day lawmakers, its unpopularity concentrated in the capital city of Providence, where the school system’s many stakeholders continue to lament the state’s 2019 seizure of its schools. 
“I am one of three councilors back in 2019 that actually testified against the takeover by the state,” said Providence City Councilor Helen Anthony at a meeting Wednesday of the Rhode Island Senate Committee on Education. “One of the reasons that I was strongly in opposition to the takeover was because of the Crowley Act itself. It was woefully inadequate, in my opinion still is, in what it does [and] doesn’t do.”
Anthony was testifying in support of two bills, S0860 and S0861, by Sen. Sam Zurier, a Providence Democrat who previously visited city councilors to discuss his plans to codify a better receivership model should state takeovers happen again. The bills belong to a suite of four pieces of legislation crafted during a special legislative study commission led by Zurier in 2023 and 2024 that sought new ways to structure the relationship between the many stakeholders in the Providence public school system.
Zurier’s tweaks to the state’s framework for intervention are based on the Springfield Empowerment Zone in neighboring Massachusetts, where a school district staved off state control through a radical revision of teachers’ union contracts.
“That vision, I am pleased to report, is union friendly,” Zurier said of the Springfield initiative, noting that 96% of the district’s unionized teachers approved of the most recent contract.  
Zurier’s bills would apply to Providence only, and would create a statute authorizing a third-party receiver to manage the district, rather than the state doing so directly. The state would appoint the receiver, who would be “a nonprofit entity or an individual with a demonstrated record of success in improving low-performing schools or districts or the academic performance of disadvantaged students,” according to one of the bill texts.  
The receivership would be authorized for up to three years, and allow the third-party to oversee staffing and budget decisions, teacher renewals and a turnaround plan with clear metrics to determine the takeover’s success. The receiver would also have some power to modify collective bargaining agreements, and Zurier’s bill specifies time periods for contract and dispute arbitration.
The current Crowley Act fails to specify much in its regulation of state takeovers in its two paragraphs on the process of state intervention, compared to the 10 pages of regulations in one of Zurier’s bills.  
 “I know it’s strange to be thinking about amending the Crowley Act when the city of Providence is considering returning to local control, but I think it’s absolutely critical,” Anthony said, arguing that the bills have value for school districts statewide. “Even though this is Providence specific, they will ensure future interventions are more effective, more accountable, and ideally less necessary.”
Former Providence schools superintendent Susan Lusi told senators that Zurier’s bills “will create legal clarity regarding the state’s authority moving forward.”
One example of the Crowley Act’s ambiguities: Last year’s protracted legal battle between the state and Providence in which a judge agreed the city owed at least $15 million to plug up deficits in the state-controlled budget. The parties had contradictory interpretations of the city’s statutory obligations for school funding under the Crowley Act. 
Rather than dismiss the possibility of state control, Zurier’s bill is actually meant to codify a stronger form of receivership, should it happen again.  
“None of this could have happened in Springfield if they weren’t scared of a state takeover under the rigorous Massachusetts law,” Zurier said. “The argument is that you need to have a structure like this in order to…incentivize people to do the right thing.” 
Jeremy Sencer, testifying on behalf of the Rhode Island Federation of Teachers, disagreed. 
“We can do many of the things, if not all, of the things that they do in the Springfield Empowerment Zone,” said Sencer, who was part of Zurier’s study commission. “It is possible, but that requires building trust, and we are not going to have trust at the end of a threat. It’s just not going to happen after this takeover…You cannot legislate trust.”

Contemplating alternatives to takeover
Two other Providence Democratic senators on the education committee offered alternate visions of state takeovers. Sen. Jake Bissaillon’s S922 would permit state takeovers but only for individual schools, not entire districts. Union representatives spoke in favor of this approach, which stemmed from Bissaillon’s utter dissatisfaction with the state takeover.  
“What grade would you give the takeover over the last six years?” Bissaillon asked Anthony when she spoke on Zurier’s bill. 
The city councilor gave the takeover a “C,” but when Bissaillon spoke on his bill, he graded it without a curve: “The takeover in 2019 completely foundered…I think I would give it an F for abject failure.” 
Sen. Tiara Mack also offered a school-based solution, with legislation that would require Providence schools to “form local elected school-based councils” at each of the district’s public schools, according to the bill text. 
All four bills were held for further study, which is standard practice.
The same day state senators mused on the mechanics of receivership, the collective voices of Providence public school students were compiled in a document released by OurSchoolsPVD, an assembly of youth-led activist groups that began in 2019 in response to the state takeover.  
The 11-page “community needs” document details the trends and prominent concerns about the city’s schools shared by students themselves at a December event,.
The students’ collected opinions reflected a ground-level vantage point, describing a number of more material and social issues like poor school buildings with mold and falling ceilings, subpar transportation and curriculums that don’t make space for students of different backgrounds or center people of color.  
The report noted that “People are not satisfied with school leadership broadly…They are frustrated by a lack of progress, transparency, accountability, and care for students.”
But the biggest complaint was a general lack of support, which was mentioned 54 times by students who attended the event.
“There is overwhelming agreement that students feel unsupported in school,” the report states.

(Aaron Sanderford/Nebraska Examiner)LINCOLN — The lawyer for four Lincoln-area gun owners told the Nebraska Supreme Court during oral arguments Thursday that his clients shouldn’t need to break a Lincoln city ordinance to gain the legal standing to sue and stop a weapons ban on city property.
Jacob Huebert, a Texas-based lawyer for the Liberty Justice Center who represents the Nebraska Firearms Owners Association, argued that all four of his clients have altered their practice of arming themselves when visiting public parks and public spaces because of the ordinance.

Thursday’s case against Lincoln echoes the argument in a separate lawsuit against the City of Omaha over a similar ban. Both lawsuits argue Lincoln and Omaha cannot ban guns in parks, trails and other public spaces because the Legislature outlawed most local gun restrictions with Legislative Bill 77 in 2023.
That law allowed Nebraskans to carry concealed handguns without a permit or state-mandated training. It also curbed some of the power of Nebraska’s larger cities to more stringently regulate guns than Nebraska law does in the rest of the state.
The Omaha case is essentially in a holding pattern in Douglas County District Court after a judge paused enforcement of an executive order from Republican Mayor Jean Stothert, who just advanced Tuesday to the May general election for a fourth term.
Lawyers for both cities have argued that past practice and ordinances and the language of LB 77 itself left room for cities to maintain some ability to restrict weapons on property the cities directly control. Attorney General Mike Hilgers disagreed.
On Thursday, Lincoln City Attorney Yohance Christie argued, as he had in his brief, that the people suing lacked standing because they had not broken the law and the city had not prosecuted anyone for the offense. He described the lawsuit as hypothetical.
He argued a district court had correctly tossed out the lawsuit because the plaintiffs lacked standing. He said the people suing had suffered no “injury.” Justices asked if he was saying they needed to break the law to sue. He said he wasn’t suggesting that.
“The only issue in front of you today is standing,” Christie said. “The standing inquiry is not whether the claim has merit. It’s whether the plaintiff is the property party to assert the claim. … There’s no reason to even get to the merits.”
Huebert said Nebraska risked holding the plaintiffs to too high a standard to sue. He said they should be allowed to make their case, because the city took away their choice to exercise their 2nd Amendment rights and feel safe.
“In the federal courts and in other state courts, plaintiffs do not have to violate a law that carries criminal penalties,” Huebert said. “To challenge that law in court, they don’t have to subject themselves to arrest, prosecution or other enforcement actions.”
Many of the justices’ questions sidestepped the constitutional issue of whether the City of Lincoln overstepped by banning weapons in city parks and some public spaces. Instead, they focused on the narrower legal issue of whether the lower court had mistakenly decided that the gun owners lacked standing to sue.
The Nebraska Supreme Court does not immediately decide such cases. It will issue a written order once the court decides.

(Joshua Haiar/South Dakota Searchlight)PIERRE — South Dakota Attorney General Marty Jackley said Thursday that a woman’s conviction for stealing $1.8 million from the state should send a message.
“Don’t do that,” Jackley said during a press conference after the announcement of the verdict.
At the end of a three-day trial and an hour of deliberation, a Hughes County jury found 68-year-old Lonna Carroll guilty on two felony counts of grand theft. She’ll be sentenced later.
Jackley said he also hopes the case sends a message to potential whistleblowers.
“That they can come forth to us, that we will take action on it, and we will do everything that we can to protect those employees that are doing the right thing,” he said. 
Carroll’s conviction is the highest-profile outcome in a recent wave of white-collar prosecutions in South Dakota state government, which have also spurred reforms and increased scrutiny on departmental financial controls.
During the trial, Jackley’s prosecution team laid out a paper trail illustrating Carroll’s scheme, played her recorded confession, and showed a document she signed saying she committed the crimes.  
Carroll formerly worked as an administrative assistant for Child Protection Services in the Department of Social Services. Her crimes were discovered by a department employee after Carroll had retired and moved to Algona, Iowa.

Carroll was found guilty of submitting fraudulent financial requests on behalf of children no longer in the state’s care, depositing the funds into accounts opened under their names, and withdrawing the money in cash for herself. Prosecutors said she did that 215 times between 2010 and 2023, stealing a total of $1,777,665.73. 
She faces up to 25 years in prison and a $50,000 fine for one count of aggravated grand theft, and 15 years in prison and a $30,000 fine for the other count.
Defense makes its case
Carroll’s defense attorney, Timothy Whalen, argued the state bore responsibility due to lax oversight. He also contended that the statute of limitations should have prevented the prosecution. 
Whalen had Logan Aukes, who manages Williams & Company CPAs in Sioux Falls, testify as an expert auditor. He said the compartmentalized nature of responsibilities within the state department created an environment where employees could look around and say, “I’m not really being looked at in anything I do.” 
Prior testimony explained that Child Protection Services has three tiers of approval for payment requests, and Carroll was authorized for all three levels.
Whalen said that because “my client was authorized,” the charges don’t fit the behavior.
Jackley called that absurd. He said there is no question the department left the door open for Carroll. But he said that leaving a door unlocked does not give someone the right to go through it. 
Afterward, when asked why the case went to trial, Whalen said Carroll exercised her constitutional right after plea discussions failed to result in a resolution.
Asked whether an agreement was ever close, Whalen responded that there were plea offers back and forth, “for pleading to one count, two counts, different recommendations of sentence.”
“My client made the decision,” Whalen said.

(Greg LaRose/Louisiana Illuminator)The University of Louisiana at Monroe will ask the University of Louisiana System Board of Supervisors for permission to furlough staff to head off an approximately $5 million to $6 million budget shortfall that must be addressed by June 30. 
The earliest the UL Board can approve the plan is April 24, so the furloughs would start no sooner than early May, acting ULM  President Nick Bruno said in an interview with the Illuminator. Because they would begin so late in the academic and fiscal year, the furlough schedule may have to be aggressive to achieve the savings necessary by June 30, the last day of the current state fiscal year. 
“We’re going to work hard to minimize the impact on [employees],” Bruno said. “I will make sure [my furlough] is heavier than anyone else’s.” 
Faculty and staff layoffs are not currently being considered, Bruno said. The university is also planning to restructure, although Bruno said no specifics have yet been ironed out. 
Bruno, 73, previously served as ULM president from 2010-20 before he retired. The UL Board tapped him to lead the campus on an interim basis while they conduct a search for a permanent replacement for Ron Berry, who was removed ahead of his planned resignation in May.
UL System Board Chairman Mark Romero said Bruno was needed to deal with the university’s budget shortfall. Berry is on administrative leave, though he is expected to return to his faculty position in the fall. 
The university instituted a hiring freeze Monday, Bruno’s first day as acting president. It is also looking at other cost-saving measures, including a temporary pause on travel and shutting air conditioning off at night. 
Gov. Jeff Landry announced a statewide hiring freeze for the executive branch Wednesday, which includes higher education. The UL Board will have to seek permission from Landry’s budget chief, Commissioner of Administration Taylor Barras, to fill any position, including the ULM presidency. 
Bruno said he would not allow the university to end the year in the red and that he does not intend to seek a handout from the system office. 
ULM is not alone in its fiscal crisis. The University of New Orleans faces a much larger budget deficit and has been working since last fall to address the shortfall. The Board of Regents last week recommended moving UNO back to the LSU system to address the crisis.

(Michael Achterling/North Dakota Monitor)The North Dakota Senate unanimously passed a property tax bill Thursday, but adopted major amendments that could set up a conference committee showdown between the House and Senate.
Amendments to House Bill 1176 reduce the maximum primary residence credit from the $1,450 approved by the House to $1,250. Gov. Kelly Armstrong, who backs the original bill, had proposed a credit of up to $1,550 for homeowners.
The Senate also adopted what Senate Majority Leader David Hogue called a “skin-in-the-game” amendment that would limit the credit to 75% of the property owner’s total tax liability. Homeowners would get a minimum tax credit of $500, the same level approved by lawmakers in 2023.
Committee advances North Dakota property tax bill but reduces level of tax credit

Another amendment includes language urging lawmakers in the 2027 session to consider reducing property taxes for other property types, such as agricultural and commercial.
Sen. Janne Myrdal, R-Edinburg, said she worries about excluding agricultural property from the tax credit when about 40% of the Legislature represents rural areas. She added rural areas depend more on property taxes than urban areas and excluding agricultural land from the bill puts a greater burden on those taxpayers.
The Senate version of the bill would provide an estimated $478 million in tax relief for citizens for 2025-27, Tax Commissioner Brian Kroshus said. 
Gov. Kelly Armstrong said he is still advocating for the House version of the bill, but he’s shifting his focus to the conference committee.
“I think if the original version was on the floor of the Senate it would pass,” Armstrong said. “I think there is plenty of room to get it back to where it was.”
The bill will now be sent back to the House for approval of the amendments. If the House does not concur with the Senate’s changes, a conference committee made up of three members from each chamber will be appointed to iron out the differences.
Hogue, R-Minot, who advocated for the amendments, said it’s possible the conference committee won’t be able to agree on how to reconcile the bill. 
He added the Senate Finance and Taxation Committee still has two property tax bills, House Bill 1575 and House Bill 1168, under consideration. Both of those bills would reduce taxes for other  property types, while House Bill 1176 only affects primary residences.
Senate lawmakers weigh questions of fairness in North Dakota property tax debate

“There may be no compromise and so we’ll go onto some other form of tax relief for North Dakotans,” Hogue said. “The Senate consensus is that what we passed today reflects the will of the Senate.”
Armstrong said the Senate may have property tax measures in reserve, but they still need to clear both chambers.
Rep. Mike Nathe, R-Bismarck, primary sponsor of the bill, said the House supports the version of the bill with a $1,450 primary residence credit. 
“This is the No. 1 issue coming into this session and people have spoken loud and clear, and that’s what’s so disappointing about these amendments being kept on and reducing the benefits,” Nathe said. “I don’t understand why they did what they did.”
Sen. Mark Weber, R-Casselton, chair of the Senate Finance and Taxation Committee, said if the bill gets to a conference committee, there will be some haggling over the primary residence credit that could go on for multiple days.
He added the two property tax bills in his committee could be used to provide technical corrections for House Bill 1176 depending on what happens during the conference committee.
“We’ve come a long ways and now we’ll begin the third period,” Weber said. “I think the governor obviously wanted the bill to come out as is so he could quickly sign it and get it out there, which is a noble thing. But there was a little difference in thinking on some of this and that’s why we have the Senate and the House.”

Free.,Judge to temporarily block Trump administration from yanking $11B in health funds from states,Jacob Fischler,,,,,https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/judge-temporarily-block-trump-administration-yanking-11b-health-funds-states,,"A federal judge in Rhode Island will grant a request from Democratic state officials to temporarily prevent President Donald Trump’s administration from cutting state health grants, the judge said at a Thursday afternoon hearing.U.S. District Court Judge Mary McElroy said the 24 Democratic attorneys general and governors were likely to prevail on the merits of their case seeking to restore funding that the Trump administration’s Department of Health and Human Services abruptly rescinded late last month.““I’m going to grant the temporary restraining order. The balance of the equities are to maintaining the funding as it is,” McElroy said after brief arguments from attorneys representing a consortium of state governments and HHS. “The harm to the plaintiff states and the plaintiff agencies if we cease that … is clearly irreparable.”HHS, under Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., revoked $11 billion in grant funding to states beginning on March 24, the states wrote in a Tuesday filing requesting the court block the move.McElroy indicated at least part of her decision was based on the broadness of the Trump administration’s argument.The administration was hampered from fighting the case after receiving the states’ motion for a temporary restraining order and “4,000 pages of exhibits” mere days ago, Leslie Kane, who represented HHS, said.“Given the time limitation … it really significantly limits any substantive argument I can make at this time,” Kane said. She still offered a general objection to the “extraordinary emergency relief” she said the states were seeking.But McElroy, whom Trump appointed during his first presidency, ruled that the “voluminous” record provided by the states weighed in favor of granting the order.“Given that the government really hasn't had time to make any kind of objection except a broad objection, I don't see how I can deny the temporary restraining order on the record that's before the court, which, again: quite voluminous,” McElroy said.States scramblingThe rescissions of grant funding in late March from COVID-19-era laws surprised state health departments and led to rapid layoffs and pauses in contract work while states scrambled to understand what other cuts they would need to make.Sarah Rice, an assistant attorney general in Rhode Island who argued for the Democratic states, listed several effects already or soon to be felt by the states.In Minnesota, 170 employees had already been laid off, with hundreds more at risk of job loss.

(Catherine McQueen/Getty Images)Humanities Montana received notice Wednesday from the National Endowment for the Humanities that its $1 million general operating grant was “terminated immediately,” according to executive director Jill Baker.
The federal money represents the bulk of the budget for Humanities Montana, which supports arts and civics programs across the state.
“Today is not a great day,” Baker said Thursday morning.
Established in 1972, Humanities Montana is a nonprofit affiliate of the NEH, “created in order to better infuse the humanities into public life.”
Baker said the $1 million pays for grants that support cultural institutions in Montana and the Humanities Montana staff, who support the grants and programs.
It pays for public humanities programming, such as a program that funds visits to schools and communities by the poet laureate or workshops by other artists, historians and philosophers.


Humanities Montana dollars
In 2023, Humanities Montana funding was spent as follows:
Programs: $371,045
Grants: $184,631
Administration: $299,892
Fundraising and outreach: $47,039
In 2023, it received $817,342 from the NEH; $160,000 from other grant revenue; $20,188 from royalties and income; and $13,699 from individuals.

Poet Laureate Chris La Tray, a Métis storyteller, said he has put roughly 40,000 miles on his truck in the last 10 months in Montana talking to people about the arts, and it connects people across cultures, ages and political leanings.
“It’s something that binds us all and is critical to our society, in Montana and beyond,” La Tray said.
A letter from National Endowment for the Humanities Acting Chairman Michael McDonald to Baker said the grant “no longer effectuates the agency’s needs and priorities” and is subject to termination “due to several reasonable causes.”
“NEH has reasonable cause to terminate your grant in light of the fact that the NEH is repurposing its funding allocations in a new direction in furtherance of the President’s agenda,” said the letter, provided to the Daily Montanan by Baker.
It cited an executive order by President Donald Trump called “Commencing the Reduction of the Federal Bureaucracy” and said termination is necessary to “safeguard the interests of the federal government, including its fiscal priorities.”
“The termination of your grant represents an urgent priority for the administration, and due to exceptional circumstances, adherence to the traditional notification process is not possible,” the letter said.
The letter is dated April 2, 2025, and said the grant was terminated “in its entirety” effective April 2, 2025.
The Trump administration and billionaire Elon Musk, through the Department of Government Efficiency, or DOGE, have been making deep cuts to the federal government.
The White House did not respond to a request for comment about the extent of the cuts at the National Endowment for the Humanities.
However, citing a senior official at the NEH, National Public Radio said the decreases are estimated to be in the millions, and no awards will be made in 2025.
Humanities Montana said its programs operate in museums, libraries, community centers, parks and educational institutions, including homeschool settings.
“It’s an essential part of building vibrant communities,” Baker said in a statement.
Michelle Nowling, executive director of the Ravalli County Museum and Historical Society, said the funds are a way that communities keep their own histories alive, and the cuts will hurt institutions in small towns.
“I think it’s a tragedy,” Nowling said.
In 2024, the museum received a $7,000 grant to support a documentary, “Bitterroot at War: The Vietnam Era.”
Nowling said the film was timed to screen this year, the 50th anniversary of the end of the war, and it features five Vietnam veterans from the Bitterroot.
“Most of them, all but one, had never spoken publicly about it before,” Nowling said.
An estimated 70 people attended the first screening, an emotional event, she said, and the museum honored all veterans who attended.
With a template in hand for such a documentary, Nowling had hoped to embark on a similar project with Bitterroot veterans of the Korean War.
However, she said small institutions don’t have many places to turn to for projects that educate and build community, and now, she isn’t sure if that idea can get off the ground.
“If we don’t have the funds to pay the people with the skills to tell our stories, how will future generations know who we were?” Nowling said.
Baker said Humanities Montana has received federal dollars for 50 years, including some increases for inflation, and the funding has been consistent.
Last year, the funding reached all 56 counties, according to Humanities Montana. The organization said the impact is “particularly significant in rural areas,” where other sources are limited.
“Investing in our communities has always been a point of pride for Montanans, and most of us have benefitted from a grant from Humanities Montana,” Baker said in a statement.
On its website, Humanities Montana shares quotes from rural educators, who said bringing quality speakers to schools is expensive, and the program is meaningful.
Money covers a stipend and travel costs, and an administrator from Baker said it’s important, “particularly for our very rural school district.”
“It can be incredibly costly and difficult to bring quality speakers to Baker, so we are very grateful that a program like this can help to make it possible,” the principal said in a quote on the Humanities Montana website.
La Tray, also a book author, said he travels the state in various capacities, including in ways supported by Humanities Montana, and he will continue to look for ways to talk with rural audiences.
He said he doesn’t imagine Trump will be able to hold onto power beyond this term, but he also said this administration isn’t the only one that hasn’t cared enough about the arts to ensure it’s an integral part of society.
In other words, La Tray said people haven’t chosen leaders, Democrat or Republican, who made funding for the humanities reliable, money that couldn’t just be “yanked” away.
“We need to change that. That begins with us at the ground level, at the grassroots level,” said La Tray, an enrolled member of the Little Shell Tribe of Chippewa Indians.
A list of Humanities Montana grants for the 2024 fiscal year includes $500 awards to rural book clubs, Big Sky Reads, and $1,000 to $10,000 awarded for films and community projects.
Projects include support for a Cree language revitalization program; an oral history of the Jewish community in Montana; and a program about “unsung hero” York, William Clark’s slave.
Baker said Humanities Montana had received the federal three-year grant of $1 million a year. The grant was set to conclude at the end of September 2025, and the termination notice ends the grant five months early.
She said continuing resolutions in Congress might affect some funding. A lot of the implications of the cut are still unclear, but she believes it would be DOGE’s intent not to reopen humanities grants.
“We’re learning this as we go,” Baker said.
Baker also said she hopes Montanans will reach out to the Congressional delegation and their friends.
She asked them to share the reasons the humanities are significant to them or to find “creative ways to safeguard this funding and the programs and individuals it supports.”
Baker said the organization has implemented a contingency plan and has “a limited privately donated reserve fund to assist with essential expenses for now.” She said staff have not been terminated but furloughs may be necessary “in the near future.”

Instead, he was on the defensive over his office's investigations and losses. (Dana DiFilippo | New Jersey Monitor)State legislators rebuked Attorney General Matt Platkin Thursday for several recent high-profile court losses and suggested New Jersey needs an inspector general to oversee his office’s work during a legislative hearing in Trenton Thursday.
Platkin, appearing before the Senate’s budget committee to discuss his $1.6 billion budget request for the next fiscal year, pushed back on the attacks that peppered nearly three hours of testimony, prompting the committee’s chair, Sen. Paul Sarlo, to chide Platkin for being “combative” and urge all parties involved to quit talking over each other.

Some of the testiest questioning came from Sen. Doug Steinhardt (R-Warren), who interrogated Platkin over gun data in the wake of Bruen, the U.S. Supreme Court’s landmark decision that forced states like New Jersey to remove restrictions on carry permits.
Steinhardt and Platkin sparred over whether an increase in people carrying firearms results in more violence. Platkin maintained that it does, which Steinhardt called a “false narrative.” Steinhardt noted that Platkin himself testified that the 778 people who were shot last year in New Jersey represents the smallest number of people shot here since state police began tracking shooting data in 2009.
“What you’re saying makes zero sense,” Steinhardt said. “You come in here telling us that shooting stats are down, yet 60,000 more people have carry permits than they did in the two and a half years preceding Bruen. With people running around carrying firearms like they would be, why aren’t the stats through the roof?
Platkin responded: “I’m not sure that anything I said doesn’t make sense … The statistics that I’m referencing are kept and collected by the state police. I don’t cook them up in my office.”
A 2022 study by Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health found gun assaults rose in states that relaxed restrictions on conceal carry permits.
The criticism of Platkin was bipartisan, with several senators bringing up recent losses by Platkin’s office of public integrity and accountability. That office led a racketeering investigation into South Jersey Democratic power broker George Norcross that resulted in a 13-count indictment a state judge dismissed in February. Platkin’s office has appealed that dismissal.
 Sen. John Burzichelli (D-Gloucester) listens to testimony during the Senate budget committee hearing on March 11, 2024. (Dana DiFilippo | New Jersey Monitor)
Sen. John Burzichelli (D-Gloucester) told Platkin the Norcross case was “painful to watch.”
“That case did appear to be a very personal matter,” Burzichelli said. “I would say, if we were talking off to the side, that a number of people feel equally aggrieved at the Norcross event, top to bottom.”
He zeroed in on comments Platkin made when he appealed the Norcross dismissal, when Platkin said the dismissal, if allowed to stand, would send a message that the “most wealthy and well-connected few” live under a diferent criminal justice system than everyone else. Those comments, as well as the loss itself, created “a distraction of confusion that doesn’t reflect well on you,” Burzichelli said.
But Platkin defended the public integrity and accountability office’s record, saying it’s had “well over 100 successful cases and … less than a handful” of losses. The media, he complained, typically ignore the wins and focus on the losses.
On his lament about two systems of criminal justice, Platkin said: “Whatever case it is, I’m the attorney general of the state. I want people to believe in the criminal justice system.”
Both Steinhardt and Burzichelli also questioned whether the Attorney General’s Office should continue overseeing state police or should be subjected to oversight itself, suggesting Platkin has a vendetta against the state police that is illustrated by recent investigations by his office that uncovered widespread problems in the agency.
Platkin rejected both suggestions. Keeping the state police under the state attorney general’s supervision would ensure coordination and oversight, he said. Supervision by an inspector general is unnecessary, he added.
“We already have robust procedures to ensure that any allegation of misconduct is taken seriously, is addressed independently within our office, and is handled appropriately,” he said.
Republican legislators in February called for Platkin’s ouster, partly over his lawsuits targeting the Trump administration.

Jessica McGowan/Getty Images (2018 file photo)Georgia senators will get one last chance this year to pass a divisive bill that spells out legislative committee investigative powers to subpoena witnesses and require them to turn over evidence. 
The Senate could take up the latest version of Senate Bill 255, which cleared the House Wednesday by a 91-67 vote following a debate over whether legislative power to conduct probes could be wielded as partisan political attacks against public officials and advocacy groups.
Rep. Rob Leverett, an Elberton Republican, said Wednesday that the measure does not expand current legislative powers but instead provides more explanation into how committees are able to legally exercise their subpoena powers in a transparent manner.
The bill was filed while Athens Republican Sen. Bill Cowsert chaired a Senate special investigative committee that became embroiled in a legal battle over the right to issue subpoenas compelling Fulton County District Attorney Fani Willis to testify and turn over a trove of documents related to the election interference case she brought against President Donald Trump and 18 codefendants. 
The Senate special committee was convened last year after Willis came under fire last year when she admitted to a romantic relationship with the special prosecutor she hired to lead the  sweeping felony election interference case following former President Joe Biden’s 2020 election victory.
  House Minority Whip Sam Park. Ross Williams/Georgia Recorder
House Minority Whip Sam Park argued Wednesday that SB 255 could be used by lawmakers to continue  efforts like the Senate committee’s investigation of Willis despite a state appellate court recently disqualifying the Fulton district attorney from the case over prosecutorial misconduct accusations. Willis has said her relationship with special prosecutor Nathan Wade did not overlap with the time she retained him to press the case against Trump and his allies.
Park, a Lawrenceville Democrat, said future legislative committees could begin using its powers to “subpoena election workers, nonprofit leaders, poll observers while demanding private emails and phone records from individuals who never committed a crime but now they’re forced to testify under oath and spend thousands on legal defense.” 
Park said GOP legislators with majority control of a chamber could also target advocacy groups they oppose on other hot button issues like women’s reproductive rights.
Cowsert’s Senate Special Committee on Investigations is also expected to begin a probe of former Democratic gubernatorial candidate Stacey Abrams’ ties to a voter registration nonprofit recently slapped with one of the largest campaign ethics fines ever levied by the state.
Earlier this session the Senate advanced Cowsert’s Senate Resolution 292, which would allow the committee to investigate the Abrams-founded New Georgia Project following a Jan. 15 settlement in a 2019 case alleging illegal campaign contributions to Abrams’ 2018 gubernatorial campaign.
  Sen. Bill Cowsert. Ross Williams/Georgia Recorder
In March, Cowsert said the committee’s purpose is not to target prominent figures in the Democratic Party, but is about holding candidates running for public office and nonprofits accountable for potentially using “dark money” to make illegal campaign contributions. 
“We’re wanting to make sure we restore the faith in our in the public that you don’t have to worry in the future that funds donated to nonprofit advocacy tax-free organizations aren’t used illegally to collaborate support campaigns on either side of the partisan divide,” Cowsert said late last month.

(Sean McCallister | Charleston Gazette-Mail photo)On the heels of a federal office in Morgantown firing dozens of employees, union representatives of West Virginia’s federal workforce call on the state’s elected leaders to speak out against what they say are “reckless cuts.” 
“We need congress to ask our president to stop the reckless cuts and take a measured approach to reforming government and balancing the budget such as was done in the 1990s,” said Dan Doyle, vice president of the American Federation of Government Employees Local 1995. “The current actions are chaotic, disruptive, counterproductive and frankly wasteful.” 
Doyle’s comments came during a press conference Thursday outside the House of Delegates chamber at the West Virginia State Capitol. Since January, hundreds of thousands of federal employees have lost their jobs as President Donald Trump and Elon Musk carry out their plan to downsize the government through the Department of Government Efficiency. 
About 23,000 employees work at 20 federal facilities in West Virginia and 33,000 federal workers live in the state, Doyle said. The total number of West Virginia federal workers who have been laid off is difficult to say, because many are under orders not to talk about it. Doyle said West Virginians will also be affected by potential cuts to federal programs and services like Social Security and the Mine Health and Safety Administration. 
“Instead of letting cuts be made by powerful interests to enrich the hands of a few, we came here today to ask our elected officials in Charleston and our citizens in our state, speak up together with us for the good of the families, for working people and for West Virginia,” Doyle said.  
About 400 workers at the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health facility in Morgantown have lost their jobs, Cathy Tinney-Zara, president of AFGE Local 3040 said. Tinney-Zara had initially said the number was around 200. The new estimate includes 185 bargaining unit employees, nonbargaining unit employees, management, contractors and others, she said. 
“We have millions of dollars of research that is just sitting there, I guess, to be destroyed,” she said Thursday. Tinney-Zara and other workers there are terminated as of June 7. At this point, the office is expected to close completely, she said. 
Altogether, a restructuring of the federal Health and Human Services will include cutting the workforce by 10,000, federal officials have said.
“I was [at NIOSH] 32 years, and people do not get into public health unless they care,” she said. “It’s devastating. People are going to die.”
The Trump administration has said it plans to cut 80,000 employees from the Department of Veterans Affairs. Bryan Hunt, president of AFGE Local 2384, said that any cuts to staffing at the state’s four Veterans Affairs Medical Centers will have a negative impact on the veterans seeking care and the communities where employees live. 
“I just ask that our representatives speak that, how concerning that is,” he said. “And know that our veterans in West Virginia are important and the VA is important. The employees are important.” 
Democrats in the state Legislature also called on Republican leaders to stand up for West Virginia workers as DOGE and the Trump administration’s tariffs potentially lead to more job loss. 
Del. John Williams, D-Monongalia, said since January, the state’s north central region has lost about 1,000 jobs. Those include cuts at NIOSH and around 200 jobs that will leave Fairmont when the Novelis facility closes after 100 years in the community. The Legislature’s Republican supermajority have done nothing to mitigate those job losses, Williams said. 
“No one is sticking up for West Virginians,” he said. “No one that they elected is sticking up for them. We can talk about it until we’re blue in the face every single day, but until Republicans start working for the people that elected them and stop trying to win MAGA member of the month, none of this is going to change.” 
Asked about recent job cuts for West Virginia workers during a press conference Thursday, Gov. Patrick Morrisey said the state should do everything it can to drive job development and pointed to some initiatives the Legislature is considering, including universal licensing reciprocity, a bill to speed up permitting processes for businesses looking to locate in the state, and legislation meant to incentivize the creation of microgrids and data centers in the state.  
“No one wants to lose a job and certainly my heart goes out to everyone. We’re going to work and fight so that there’s so many jobs in West Virginia that we’re going to really succeed as a state,” Morrisey said. “I know that there have been a number of stories [about job losses] recently, but I’m optimistic the long-term arc, if we do what we need to do here, is going to work out well for the people of our state.”

A review by the Michigan Secretary of State’s Office found 15 additional people who may have voted in the 2024 general election despite not being U.S. citizens—a significant increase from previous reports. The newly identified voters are scattered across Michigan, with no immediate indication of any broader coordinated effort, officials said.
The information comes as lawmakers at both the state and federal level consider requiring documentary proof of citizenship before voters are able to register.
The results of the review, first reported by The Detroit News, are in addition to the single reported instance of noncitizen voting: Haoxiang Gao, a University of Michigan student who allegedly cast a vote in Ann Arbor last year despite not being a U.S. citizen. Gao faces felony charges for the accused crime and is expected in court later this month.
Though the 15 potential noncitizen voters represent a tiny fraction of the more than 5.7 million ballots cast in the 2024 general election, Michigan Republicans pointed to the findings as justification for their recent proposed constitutional amendment, which would require new voters to prove their citizenship at the time they register. The amendment leaves it to future Legislatures to define what qualifies as valid proof. Voters already registered could also be forced to prove their citizenship as the proposal requires the state to run continual citizenship checks on the voting rolls.
“First it was 1, now it’s 15,” Rep. Bryan Posthumus, a Republican from Rockford and the primary author of the proposal, said in a social media post shortly after news broke. “The truth is, we have no idea how many. And now that everyone knows the loophole exists, how many more if we don’t close it!”
Angela Benander, spokesperson for the Secretary of State’s Office, said the state began cross-checking Michigan driver’s license records with the Qualified Voter File — the state’s official list of more than 8.1 million registered voters — late last year. Noncitizens can legally obtain Michigan driver’s licenses and state IDs, so the comparison focused on individuals listed as noncitizens in licensing records who also voted in the general election.
Officials noted that newly naturalized citizens don’t always immediately update the state, instead opting to show their new citizenship when they next renew their license.
Of 15 new potential cases, 13 were referred to Attorney General Dana Nessel’s office for investigation. One of the 15 people has died since voting. The final person is being investigated for other potentially fraudulent voter activity, SOS spokesperson Angela Benander told Votebeat.
Secretary of State Jocelyn Benson, in an emailed statement to Votebeat, said that noncitizen voting was a “serious issue” but one that required “a scalpel, not a sledgehammer.”
“Our careful review confirms what we already knew – that this illegal activity is very rare. While we take all violations of election law very seriously, this tiny fraction of potential cases in Michigan and at the national level do not justify recent efforts to pass laws we know would block tens of thousands of Michigan citizens from voting in future elections,” said Benson, a Democrat who is running for governor. “Instead of those failed policies, we will continue to work with lawmakers on reasonable, data-driven efforts to improve security while ensuring that eligible citizens can always make their voice heard.”
Nessel’s office confirmed it was reviewing the cases, saying it would announce charges if they were filed.
“Attorney General Nessel is, of course, disappointed to learn any number of non-citizens were able to cast ballots in our recent elections, and Michiganders should be assured that those criminally responsible will be held accountable to the fullest extent of the law,” Nessel spokesperson Danny Wimmer said.
Benander said Michigan’s findings are consistent with other states. In Georgia, for instance, officials last year found that about 20 noncitizens on the state’s voter rolls of more than 8.2 million registered voters. Benander said the state will do similar analyses in the future to ensure only citizens are voting in the state’s elections.
Benson has acknowledged noncitizen voting as a legitimate concern, but argues that requiring broad documentary proof would not solve the issue. Benson said in February that she would instead work with Democrats in the legislature to close loopholes that make noncitizen voting possible, although no such legislation has been introduced yet.
The proposed constitutional amendment, known as House Joint Resolution B, passed out of the House Election Integrity Committee last month and is now before the full Michigan House, where it has the support of a Republican majority. But even if it passes the House, it faces slim odds in the Democrat-controlled Senate.
A parallel citizen-led effort may move the proposal forward instead. “Prove It, Michigan,” the group backing a ballot initiative to require proof-of-citizenship, is scheduled to appear before the Board of State Canvassers as soon as this month to confirm their proposed ballot language. If approved, they could immediately begin collecting the more than 446,000 signatures required to be on the ballot.

(Henry Redman | Wisconsin Examiner)The Wisconsin Supreme Court heard arguments Thursday in a case related to a statewide literacy program that considers Gov. Tony Evers’ partial veto power and lawmakers’ handling of emergency funds.
The case comes as the result of the last state budget and efforts by state lawmakers, Gov. Tony Evers and the Department of Public Instruction to overhaul literacy programs in Wisconsin. 
During the 2023-25 budget cycle, lawmakers placed $50 million aside in an emergency fund controlled by the Joint Finance Committee that was meant to go towards funding new literacy programs. Lawmakers also passed AB 321 — now 2023 Wisconsin Act 20 — to establish the policy portions of the initiative, which included creating a new office in the Department of Public Instruction and instructing the agency to hire literacy coaches and create a grant program. 
Lawmakers subsequently passed SB 971, now 2023 Wisconsin Act 100, to create a mechanism for DPI to spend the money when the funds were transferred. A partial veto by Gov. Tony Evers caused lawmakers to sue, saying it wasn’t an appropriations bill therefore not subject to a partial veto.  Evers argued that the law included an appropriation and further asserted that DPI has been urging lawmakers to release the funds, which will lapse back into the state’s $4 billion budget surplus if not used before June 30.
Before the Supreme Court heard the case, a Dane County judge had ruled Evers’ veto proper, but said there wasn’t a case for the release of the funds. Both parties appealed to the Wisconsin Court of Appeals, but the Wisconsin Supreme Court agreed to take the appeal directly
Assistant Attorney General Charlotte Gibson, the Department of Justice lawyer for DPI and Evers, argued that lawmakers don’t have the power to withhold the money and the court should order the release of the money to DPI. 
The issues at hand, Gibson said, “reflect an interlocking strategy to control how the executive branch spends funds and to limit the governor’s partial veto power. It involves dissecting appropriations into multiple bills and crediting funds set aside for executive agency programs to [the Joint Finance Committee] to control their destination and use. Those efforts are illegal, and they misread the governor’s veto authority.” 
Gibson said that the intention of the law, and the money being placed in the emergency fund, was to give money to specific agencies for specific purposes. A brief notes that “over the past few decades, the Legislature has increasingly used that appropriation not for emergencies, but rather to fund anticipated expenses through a legislative committee that purports to retain veto power over how the executive branch spends appropriated money.” 
Gibson said that the purpose of the emergency fund statute was not to serve as “a holding pen for lots of money that the Legislature wanted to give [the committee] power over,” but lawmakers are using it “to say, actually, we can spend it on whatever purpose…” 
“We think to correct the constitutional violation here, this agency can order those funds to be released,” Gibson said. 
Justices questioned Gibson on why the funds would need to be released to DPI if there was never an appropriation.
“The reality is the money’s sitting in a fund right now, and it hasn’t done anything with it,” Justice Rebecca Dallet said. “For all, we know they are going to use it for an emergency and not give it to anybody for anything else … that just hasn’t happened yet.”
Gibson replied that DPI has asked for the money and lawmakers haven’t given it to the agency. 
“But, I’m saying, [JFC] hasn’t appropriated it anywhere,” Dallet said. “Is DPI having an emergency where you think this is emergency money that you should get…?” 
“No, we think it’s unconstitutional for DPI not to get the money.” Gibson said. 
“Even if you were right, that the statutory structure here is constitutionally problematic, I still don’t see how you win and get the money, because that is not what the law says,” Justice Brian Hagedorn said. “There’s no provision of law that actually gives the money to DPI or appropriates the money to DPI.”
Gibson noted that the co-chairs of the committee Sen. Howard Marklein and Rep. Mark Born have said the money is earmarked for the purpose of the literacy programs. 
“What we’re struggling with is that we understand that there are hints and clues, earmarks — so different from an appropriation — and the way I’m looking at it, it could probably be parked in that fund indefinitely and that’s where I’m struggling with what’s the legal nexus,” said Justice Janet Protasiewicz. 
Ryan Walsh, the attorney representing the Legislature, argued Evers’ veto was inappropriate because the bill was not an appropriation bill, and that the remedy should be that the bill is law as passed by the Legislature, without Evers’ veto. 
“You can’t have an appropriation bill that makes no appropriation. It just doesn’t make sense,” Walsh said. However, he also said that if he is wrong then it means the law was improperly enacted because lawmakers passed it by voice vote, not roll call as is required of appropriations bills. 
Walsh said that under his argument the money would stay in JFC and go back to the treasury at the end of the biennium. 
“It doesn’t go to DPI,” Walsh said. “There is no obligation for [JFC] to disperse this money.” 
Justice Jill Karofsky said that she didn’t disagree about the discretion of the committee, but asked about the potential for lawmakers to abuse the discretion. 
“There aren’t really any guardrails here,” Karofsky said. 
Walsh said abuse “just doesn’t happen.” 
“What would stop the Legislature from emptying every last dollar of the Wisconsin treasury into a [JFC] emergency account?” Karofsky asked further. 
Walsh said many things could prevent that from happening, including the governor refusing to sign a budget that does so. 
Walsh also said the emergency account is a small portion of the state budget. He said that in the last 10 years the percentage of the budget that has gone to the supplemental account has ranged from 0.06% in the 2017-19 budget to 0.33% in the 2021-23 budget.
Justice Ann Walsh Bradley said she thought “part of why we are here [is] that some want us to take a look at this structure — allowing JFC to have this discretion — and that to not address it would be a rather lame opinion.”
Walsh said that he didn’t think the Court needed to reach the constitutional question. 
“I don’t think anybody is insisting that you decide whether [Wisconsin should retain the] supplemental funding structure, which has been in place a long time, and by the way, the governor and the Legislature are assuming it’s still in place,” Walsh said. “We have a new budget pending… There are lots of reasons to be cautious here.”

Brian Strickland from McDonough aims to ease the pressures of the increasingly expensive cost of raising a family for Georgians. Getty ImagesThe rising cost of child care and workforce shortages have hit Georgia families and providers hard in the aftermath of the pandemic. 
While the state did see the burden alleviated via temporary federal relief programs for families and financial support for child care workers, those programs have ended. Advocates for children are calling on state lawmakers to now increase financial support for Georgia’s families. A pending proposal aims to introduce tax credits to offer parents some support, but time in the legislative session is quickly running out. Friday is the last chance for lawmakers to take action before the 2025 legislative session closes.
Child care expenses are a concern that hits home for John Jackson, head of financial planning and analysis for BlackRock in Atlanta and a member of the board of directors for Georgia Early Education Alliance for Ready Students.  
“As a dad of three daughters, I know how challenging it can be to find reliable, high-quality child care,” Jackson said. “I’ve had mornings where our backup child care is unavailable, and it’s instant chaos in terms of my wife and I trying to figure out who’s going to miss work, what schedule and meetings will be changed and how we are going to close those gaps.”
Several nonprofits like GEEARS and Voices for Georgia’s Children are advocating for financial support for families, especially those with young children. In the COVID era, many parents pulled their children out of child care facilities while teachers also left their workplaces due to stay-at-home orders. This allowed providers to lower their prices significantly, but as parents have returned to work and new families search for a place to take care of their children, providers have struggled to maintain enough openings at an affordable price.  
“The child care system that we have now really doesn’t work for families who need care, or for the teachers who teach and care for the kids who are in care,” said Ife Finch Floyd, director of economic justice for the Georgia Budget and Policy Institute. “Often people call that a market failure, where we can’t always meet the needs of the demand.” 
Child care providers face a hard time attracting new employees and retaining current workers while keeping prices affordable for families. Since other employers can offer more competitive wages, many workers may opt for a career outside of the child care industry. Many providers have raised prices to cover their expenses and increase workers’ wages.   
A bill sponsored by Republican Sen. Brian Strickland from McDonough aims to ease the pressures of the increasingly expensive cost of raising a family for Georgians. 
  Sen. Brian Strickland. Ross Williams/Georgia Recorder
Strickland proposes to allow taxpayers to claim 50% of a portion of their child care expenses on their state taxes, up from 30%. His bill would also create a new $250 credit per child six years of age or younger. It also aims to offer a $1,000 tax credit for child care facilities for each employee whose child is six years of age or younger and is enrolled in the facility.
Strickland’s bill has now been tacked onto House Bill 136, legislation designed to increase financial support for foster care providers. Last year, Strickland was involved in a Senate study committee that explored child care costs in Georgia, where he says he learned more about how child care access affects not only families but businesses too. His work on this bill comes from a personal place – his own family life. 
“Having two young children myself, a lot of people that I come in contact with have kids the same age as my kids and we’re are all struggling with the same thing,” Strickland said. “We’re all trying to figure out ‘can we make enough money working to cover child care costs?’ It’s something that’s affecting people all around our state.” 
 The bill has received bipartisan support throughout the session. Advocates and legislators emphasize the economic benefits of strong support for early education. A flyer passed out by GEEARS at a recent press conference read, “Every $1 invested in high-quality early learning yields as much as $13 in savings.” 
“This is a piece that is designed to help the taxpayer,” Strickland said. “This is keeping more of the money that you’d otherwise be paying the government.” 
Since the credits offered by Strickland’s bill are non-refundable and cannot exceed the taxpayer’s tax liability, they would cost the state tax revenue. State estimates of the original bill’s cost calculated the hit to the state budget to be about $179 million in the first year. Floyd said that the cost is likely higher than this number now, as the federal match provision increased the the state credit from 40% to 50%. 
“We are supportive of tax policy that supports families with low to moderate/middle income,” said Floyd. “GBPI has long supported tax credits for the families of everyday Georgians and individuals to make sure that they can afford their basic needs and help plan for their futures.” 
While there is bipartisan consensus on the reality of rising child care costs, there are differing views on the best ways to offer relief.
  Rep. Lisa Campbell Ross Williams/Georgia Recorder
Kennesaw Democratic state Rep. Lisa Campbell proposes the “Georgia’s Children First” trust fund in House Resolution 396. Her bill would take a portion of Georgia’s budget surplus to support the Child and Parent Services Program, allocate money for child care providers and help purchase supplies that young children need, like diapers.  
“The annual rate of child care in Georgia right now is about $11,000 per child per year,” Campbell said. “And that’s in many cases more expensive than a college degree.” 
Creating a new trust fund in Georgia requires a constitutional amendment. Although her proposal did not receive a committee hearing before the Crossover Day deadline in early March, Campbell hopes to continue supporting this bill next year when bills filed this year that don’t pass in 2025 can have a second chance. She said Strickland’s tax credit is a “great thing to do.” 
She also recognizes the role that gender plays in the fight to support families. 
“When women exit the workforce to care for children and come back, it’s often very difficult to catch up in terms of the types of roles and responsibilities that they are offered,” she said. “It’s very rare that a woman will catch up to her peers who did not leave the workforce.”  
The proposed tax credit was unanimously approved by the Senate in late March. Strickland frames this bill as a “step” towards increasing support for Georgia’s working families. Inside and outside of the Capitol, supporters of legislation like this are advocating for Georgia’s young children to be prioritized in various ways. 
“We at Voices are big advocates for dollars and support for quality afterschool and summer learning programming as well,” said Polly McKinney, advocacy director for Voices for Georgia’s Children. “We know that school aged children deserve developmentally appropriate, safe, educational and fun places to grow into the happy, healthy and wise adults who will carry the rest of us into the future.”
The House approved Strickland’s proposal Wednesday but made a tweak to an unrelated part of the bill, so it still needs another vote in the Senate to make it to the governor’s desk and turn into law.

,DC,2025-04-03 21:47:56+00:00,News From The States - Fair. Fearless. Free.,Economists blast calculations for 'bombshell' Trump tariffs as faulty while stocks plunge,Ashley Murray,,,,,https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/economists-blast-calculations-bombshell-trump-tariffs-faulty-while-stocks-plunge,,"WASHINGTON — Markets and business owners in the United States and around the world reeled Thursday following President Donald Trump’s announcement of sweeping and steep tariffs that are not “reciprocal” but rather punish many countries that U.S. importers heavily rely on, experts say.U.S. stocks plummeted to their lowest levels since June 2020, financial media reported at the closing bell Thursday. Business groups issued criticisms, experts predicted increases in household spending and even a conservative Republican senator pushed legislation that would increase congressional power over tariffs.Trump unveiled the tariffs Wednesday during a White House Rose Garden event billed as “Liberation Day,” where he told the crowd that trading partners and allies have “torn apart our once beautiful American dream.”His answer: Signing a “historic executive order instituting reciprocal tariffs on countries throughout the world. Reciprocal. That means they do it to us, and we do it to them. Very simple.”But economists say the new U.S. tariffs Trump revealed Wednesday — illustrated on a large display table — do not match one-for-one other countries’ levies, as Trump said during his remarks.Trump held in his hands a chart that claimed to show a list of other countries’ taxes on American imports.But it was wrong.The problem with the chartVietnam does not charge a 90% tariff on American imports, as the chart said. Rather its rate for imported U.S. goods was on average 9.4% in 2023, according to the World Trade Organization.“The actual calculation (circulated by the White House) doesn't factor in other countries’ tariffs,” said Brad Setser, senior fellow on global trade at the Council on Foreign Relations, a think tank focused on international affairs.In other words, Setser told States Newsroom Thursday, “It’s a tariff on big bilateral trade deficits.”And so, what does that mean? And why did the president’s chart say that the U.S. would now be charging a 46% tax on every imported good from Vietnam?Vietnam is a small country, but a competitive exporter, particularly in broadcasting equipment, microchips and computers. And the U.S. is a big customer.In 2023, the U.S. imported $118 billion in goods from Vietnam, while Vietnam imported about $9.6 billion in U.S. products that year, according to the Observatory of Economic Complexity, a trade data project with roots at MIT.The White House claimed on the chart that Vietnam applies a 90% tariff on the U.S. — when actually that percentage is roughly the dollar amount of the U.S. trade deficit divided by the dollar amount of how much the U.S. imports from the country. So, $120B - $10B = $110B, then divide that by $120B, and you get roughly 91%.Trump said he would be “kind” and give trading partners “discounted” tariff rates by about half, and that’s how Vietnam landed at a 46% tax on its imports into the U.S.“So Vietnam got hit with a huge tariff. It is literally that simple,” Setser said.Economists and journalists almost immediately took to social media to question the glaring inaccuracy.‘Bombshell’ tariffsThe new rates are a “bombshell” on U.S. allies and trading partners, said Jack Zhang, a professor of political science who runs the Trade War Lab at the University of Kansas.Vietnam tried to head off Trump’s announcement in March by cutting levies on U.S. imports and signing “big purchase agreements,” Zhang said, but it didn’t work.Historically countries have negotiated tariffs product by product in “laborious” talks, Zhang said.“You know, ‘You reduce tariffs on your stuff, I will reduce tariffs on maybe some other stuff.’ And it nets out to be fair. This sort of lazy, back-of-the-envelope kind of calculation based on the trade deficit, it makes it really hard to negotiate in those terms,” he said.Products from the European Union will now be taxed at 20%, Japan’s new rate is 24%, and South Korea’s 25% — all significant U.S. allies and trading partners. The EU has already threatened to retaliate if the U.S. does not come to the negotiating table.Countries carrying a trade surplus with the U.S. — meaning they import more American goods than they sell back to the U.S. — did not escape the policy, as Trump imposed a universal 10% tariff on every nation.The United Kingdom, which runs a trade surplus with the U.S. and in 2023 charged an average of 3.8% on imported American products, will now see a 10% tax on its items headed to U.S. buyers. Australia, whose Prime Minister Anthony Albanese called the tariffs “totally unwarranted,” faces the same situation.Trump’s informational table falsely stated that the U.K., Australia and a host of other countries — including the Heard and McDonald Islands, inhabited by penguins and seals — have been charging a 10% tax on American goods.‘Damage to their own people’Trump did not include Canada and Mexico in his announcement Wednesday.But those countries are already subject to up to 25% taxes on steel, aluminum and other imports that the administration enacted in March, after declaring emergencies over illicit fentanyl and immigrants crossing the northern and southern borders.Additionally Trump’s 25% foreign car tax launched Thursday.  The neighboring countries factor big into the automobile supply chain.“Given the prospective damage to their own people, the American administration should eventually change course, but I don't want to give false hope. The president believes that what he is doing is best for the American economy,” Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney said Thursday in remarks that streamed on C-SPAN. Carney said he and Trump have agreed to economic and security negotiations next month.The proposed tariffs will amount to an average $2,100 tax increase per American household, according to an analysis released Thursday by the center-right Tax Foundation, which advocates for lower taxes.The average levy on all imports will reach 18.8%, compared to 2.5% in 2024, according to the foundation’s modeling.Numerous trade and advocacy groups spoke out against the tariffs.The National Association of Manufacturers urged the Trump administration to “minimize tariff costs for manufacturers that are investing and expanding in the U.S.”The center-right Taxpayers Protection Alliance issued a scathing statement Thursday. “​​American consumers and taxpayers should be appalled by this executive overreach,” said its president David Williams.States Newsroom spoke to small business owners from around the country who expressed fear about the cost of day-to-day supplies. One Arizona coffee shop owner told the news outlet that he purchased a year’s supply of disposable coffee cups from China last year in anticipation of Trump igniting a trade war.Trump announced a 34% tax on Chinese imports Wednesday, and some experts say that will stack on top of the existing 20% tariffs Trump imposed during his first administration that were kept in place by former President Joe Biden.Senators want more control over tariffsA bipartisan pair of senators introduced on Thursday what they’ve titled the “American Trade Review Act of 2025,” aiming to claw back congressional power over the president’s near unilateral decision-making on U.S. tariffs.“Inflation and high costs are a threat to the stability and prosperity of American businesses of all sizes, to our farmers and to our consumers,” Democratic Sen. Maria Cantwell of Washington state said on the Senate floor. She and Republican Sen. Chuck Grassley of Iowa are co-sponsoring the legislation.“We live now in an interconnected world, a global economy, and advances in technology and transportation have brought that world closer and closer together. We have a global economy,” Cantwell continued.States Newsroom sent a list of questions to the White House regarding their informational table of tariffs presented Wednesday and an opportunity to respond to criticism.In a statement, White House spokesperson Kush Desai said, “Trillions in historic investment commitments from industry leaders ranging from Apple to Hyundai to TSMC are indicative of how this administration is working with the private sector while implementing President Trump’s pro-growth, pro-worker America First agenda of tariffs, deregulation, tax cuts, and the unleashing of American energy.“These America First economic policies delivered historic job, wage, and investment growth in his first term, and everyone from Main Street to Wall Street is again going to thrive as President Trump secures our nation’s economic future,” the statement continued.TSMC, a Taiwanese mega semiconductor producer, received $6.6 billion in direct funding from the U.S., plus $5 billion in cheap loans, under Biden’s administration after he signed the CHIPS and Science Act, according to an analysis by the Council on Foreign Relations. The country announced an additional $100 billion investment in early March.Trump announced a 32% tariff on the island nation.",,,,2025-04-03 18:06:33.935065

(Photo by Drew Angerer/Getty Images.)Here’s the real kick about how President Donald Trump’s tariffs are going to hike prices for everything: Once that happens, even if the tariffs go away, the prices are never, ever going back down again.
This will impact nearly every item you can imagine: clothing, shoes, computers, phones, tablets, gaming consoles and controllers, automobiles, wine and spirits, everyday household items, furniture, coffee, chocolate.
The White House expects the tariffs to raise $6 trillion in tax revenue. That would be the largest tax hike in U.S. history.
The businesses that pay the import taxes will pass nearly all of it on to consumers by raising prices. So the responsibility for paying for this tax hike will fall hardest all regular American families, especially those who already have fixed and limited incomes.
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
In Ohio, that’s a significant chunk of our population.
Ohio currently has the 12th highest poverty rate in the nation.
The current poverty line for a family of four is a household income of $32,150.
Ohio’s overall poverty rate is 13.4%, and the child poverty rate 17.7%.
Ohio has about 11.8 million people, including about 2.6 million children.
This means that roughly 1.5 million Ohioans are living at or below the poverty line, including about 460,000 children.
These families will suffer the most, especially in the short-run, and are anticipated to lose about 4% of their disposable income.
When your entire household is trying to survive on less than $32,000 per year, that $1,280 loss in buying power hurts a lot.
That’s more than $100 per month, money that could’ve been used on groceries, toiletries, bills, basic necessities.
Imagine what $100 a month means to our senior citizens on the fixed incomes of their retirement and Social Security.
Ohio’s median household income is $69,680. A family at that level can’t afford to lose $100 a month either. And it will probably be even more for them.
While the impact as a percentage of income hits those on the lowest end of income the hardest, the actual dollar amount goes up alongside earnings/spending.
If you split up household incomes into tenths from the bottom up, the Yale Budget Lab projects that the average annual cost to households in the 2nd, 5th, and top decile rise to $1,700; $3,000; and $8,100 respectively.
We all get to pay the price for this in one way or another.
Trump’s auto tariffs, for instance, are expected to cost more than $30 billion in higher vehicle prices and reduced car sales in the first year.
Stellantis has temporarily laid off 900 U.S. workers affected by plant pauses in Canada and Mexico due to the tariffs. The UAW has hit back, calling that unnecessary. Regardless, the chaos will push corporations to protect their profits first, considering human damage control second, and to expect anything else would be foolish.
American auto companies can expect to be hit with retaliatory tariffs, which may impact auto-manufacturing and jobs and workers in Oho.
Ohio farmers can also expect to be impacted by retaliatory tariffs.
More than 20% of farm income comes from exports. Ohio is a major exporter of soybeans and corn. Ohio soybean exports generate $5 billion to $6 billion annually, but soybean exports have sank significantly in recent years, starting with the tariffs of the first Trump administration.
A potential $110 billion economic hit: How Trump’s tariffs could mean rising costs for families

The current Trump trade war with the entire rest of the world will only sink them further. The impacts on soybean and corn will affect more than 75,000 Ohio farms statewide.
Many farmers also rely on imported goods like fertilizer. The price hikes on that will raise the cost of production, and that cost will again be passed along to Ohio and American families.
Trump is promising that a revival of manufacturing will happen, eventually, because of this trade war.
Even if that comes true, it will take years, and therefore it will take years of suffering this trade war — with no guarantee of benefit to follow, much less anything better than where we were before Trump blew up the American-led world economic order.
But don’t worry America, all that Myanmar-style garment factory work you’ve been clamoring to do is coming, baby. 
That’s the message, apparently.
But I think Ohioans should remember that during his first term, Trump made the same such promises about manufacturing revival.
One of his primary boasts way back then was that Republic Steel was going to be bringing back 1,000 jobs to Lorain, Ohio.
It never happened.
Being great again is always just around the next corner, isn’t it?
In the meantime, we all get to suffer for Donald Trump and Elon Musk so that they and their country club buddies can have more.
They’ve got massive tax cuts for the rich that add $9 trillion to the national debt to pass next.
Isn’t that fun? A $6 trillion tax hike on everyday Americans, and a $9 trillion tax giveaway to the rich.
But I don’t want you to worry. If they tank the economy, Donald Trump and Elon Musk are going to be OK, even if your 401k isn’t.
When the economy tanked during the pandemic, workers lost $3.7 trillion worth of wealth while billionaires gained $3.9 trillion.
And even if they do needlessly tank the economy, we can all rest easy knowing that they shredded the social safety net before they did.

Byron Donalds was in Tallahassee Thursday, where he met with House Speaker Daniel Perez and members of the House he once served with.
“Well, I mean everybody knows we had some scheduling changes in Washington,” Donalds said, referencing the decision by GOP leaders in the U.S. House of Representatives to cancel votes after failing to block a change in rules. 
Donalds was one of nine Republicans to buck GOP leadership and agree to allowing new parents serving in the chamber to vote by proxy. 
 “So, it opened up a day for me to come down here, have some meetings with people in Tallahassee about what their views are, what their goals are for the future of the state, share with them my thoughts. 
“And then, it’s always good to be back at the Florida House. It’s been a long time since I’ve been on the House floor.”
Donalds was a member of the Florida House of Representatives from 2016 to 2020. He has served in Congress since 2021. 
In a media availability with reporters, Donalds defended President Donald Trump’s economic policies, played down recent Florida election results that saw Republicans win by smaller margins than in the recent past, and dismissed increasing tensions between Perez and Gov. Ron DeSantis.
Regarding the Perez-DeSantis relationship, Donalds said it’s “actually pretty typical.”
“I think the most unfortunate thing is now it’s spilling out,” he said. “They’re going to finish their business here. I’m quite sure that the governor, the House, and the Senate will come to a resolution on a lot of these issues.”
President Donald Trump has endorsed Donalds to be the next governor of Florida. The endorsement has strained his relationship with DeSantis, who has repeatedly said his wife, First Lady Casey DeSantis, would be a good choice to replace him. The first lady has not publicly announced any run.
Donalds said he didn’t collect any gubernatorial endorsements from state legislators while in Tallahassee.
He didn’t share his opinion about whether he preferred DeSantis’ approach to reduce property taxes or House Speaker Danny Perez’s push to pare back the state sales tax rate from 6% to 5.25% instead. Donalds said he didn’t want to get in the way of negotiations.
“Because, to be blunt, there’s one governor at a time. They are going to take care of this and we move on from here.”
He said the goal is to “make sure that the people of Florida are getting what they need.”

The company has 30 days to file an appeal with the state’s Waste Management Council. A Casella spokesperson did not immediately return a request for comment regarding whether the company would do so.
For years, local residents have rallied against the project, citing its proximity to a pristine lake and forest, and related fears about how the landfill would impact the environment and public health. Republican Gov. Kelly Ayotte joined them in their efforts, vowing in her inaugural address in January that the landfill would not be built. At the same time, solid waste management across the state has come under greater legislative scrutiny, especially after the state approved hotly contested updates to its landfill regulations in December.
A permit application becomes dormant when the applicant fails to submit required information requested by the department within a year of first being notified that the application is incomplete. For Casella, that one-year mark came on Feb. 28, according to a letter sent to the company Thursday by Mike Wimsatt, the agency’s solid waste management division director.
A dormant, incomplete application “shall be deemed denied without further action by the department,” per the letter.
Wimsatt said the application remained incomplete for a number of reasons. For one, it lacked a “site report that demonstrates that the location of the proposed facility complies with all applicable siting requirements and that the site is a suitable location for the proposed facility …,” according to the letter. Additionally, “the maps, figures, and hydrogeological report” submitted by the applicant in 2023 had not been updated to show compliance with the state’s regulations that were updated in December, Wimsatt said.
Legal agreements submitted by the company “failed to fulfill application requirements because they were heavily redacted and referenced other legal agreements, which were not provided,” Wimsatt said.
The company also had not submitted “copies of the documents that demonstrate that the applicant and their successors and assigns will have a legal right for the use of the properties as proposed in the application,” which the state requires, according to the letter.
For those who have invested years in fighting the landfill, it was a moment of optimism. But for many, the work doesn’t end in Dalton. Adam Finkel, a former federal regulator and Dalton resident who has advocated for solid waste reform in the state, pointed to pending legislation to bolster the state’s landfill siting requirements and other aspects of the recently updated regulations that raised deep concerns last year.
“Very happy that DES has done the right thing, but it doesn’t in any way, large or small, deter me from the larger goal,” Finkel said, “which is making sure that no community in New Hampshire ever has to deal with this kind of inept vanity project in a terrible location, unneeded, ever again.”",https://newhampshirebulletin.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/IMG_7519-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-04-03 18:06:33.935065

Photo by A.J. Olmscheid/Senate Media Services.Minnesota Senate Democrats are proposing a first-in-the-nation tax on large social media companies that collect data on Minnesota consumers.
The bill, chief authored by Senate Taxes Committee Chair Sen. Ann Rest, DFL-New Hope, would impose a tax on social media companies based on the number of monthly active Minnesota consumers from whom the company collects data.
Minnesota is facing a looming multi-billion dollar budget deficit, and lawmakers are working to cut spending and generate new revenue to offset the imbalance. In an interview, Rest said taxing social media companies is a solution that doesn’t hurt Minnesotans — it doesn’t cut critical social services or increase their taxes.
“We know we’re going to see some cuts, but I also felt it was my job to look for some fair ways to provide the revenue,” Rest said. “We’re talking about folks like Elon Musk and Mark Zuckerberg. We’ve been giving to them for years and years, and now we’re going to ask those social media businesses to participate in solving Minnesota’s budget challenges.”
Under the bill (SF 3197), if a social media company has fewer than 100,000 monthly consumers from Minnesota, it wouldn’t be taxed. If the social media company has between 500,000 and 1 million Minnesota consumers, the tax per month would be $40,000 plus 25 cents times the number of consumers over 500,000.
For the largest social media companies — those that have over 1 million Minnesota consumers — the tax per month would be $165,000 plus 50 cents times the number of consumers over 1 million.
The Department of Revenue estimates that the tax would apply to 15 social media companies. The tax, which would begin in January 2026, would generate around $46 million in the first fiscal year, $92 million in the second and about $100 million annually after that.
Meta, the parent company of Facebook, reported $62 billion in profit in 2024, on $164 billion in revenue.
Even as the companies make hundreds of billions of profit, social scientists are sounding the alarm on the widespread use of the apps, especially by young people.
Republicans this year have said that they will not support any new taxes on Minnesotans, so lawmakers have been looking for areas to cut spending. When asked whether House Republicans would support a tax on social media companies, a spokesperson said no.
“Our position is no tax increases,” a House GOP caucus spokesperson said.
New York since 2021 has proposed taxing social media companies for data collection, or data mining, and a similar bill is again being considered by the New York Legislature this year.
Rest said that she hopes Minnesota’s legislation can be regarded as a model for other states that are experiencing budget shortfalls.
The bill will be heard in the Senate Taxes Committee on Wednesday, and Rest said House Taxes co-chair Rep. Aisha Gomez, DFL-Minneapolis, will be introducing the House version soon.",https://minnesotareformer.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/250306_AO_2245.jpg_1741797144-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-04-03 18:06:33.935065

(Photo Courtesy NMHC website)An organization that provides small grants to uplift and explain New Mexico culture and history will have to close its doors, following deep cuts to the National Endowment for the Humanities and local humanities councils across the country.
The New Mexico Humanities Council has been around since 1972 and has provided schools, tribes, colleges, cultural centers, libraries and others grants to engage “New Mexicans with history, culture and humanities topics.” 
Recent events that credit the council include a Taos exhibition honoring Hispanic stories of northern New Mexico; a youth history competition; and virtual learning experiences at the New Mexico Farm & Ranch Heritage Museum in Las Cruces.
“Those will essentially go away,” said Brandon Johnson, executive director of the humanities council, in a phone interview Thursday with Source New Mexico. 
Johnson received two letters around 11 p.m. Wednesday from Michael McDonald, the acting director of the National Endowment for the Humanities, related to two NEH grants the council received. About $500,000 had not been awarded to the council, Johnson said, from what online records show were initially $11.3 million contracts.
“NEH has reasonable cause to terminate your grant in light of the fact that the NEH is repurposing its funding allocations in a new direction in furtherance of the President’s agenda,” McDonald wrote in the letter dated April 2, citing a February Trump executive order seeking to reduce the federal bureaucracy.

“Your grant’s immediate termination is necessary to safeguard the interests of the federal government, including its fiscal priorities. The termination of your grant represents an urgent priority for the administration,” McDonald wrote.
The letter goes on to note that an audit may still occur, even though the grants were terminated, and provides a Microsoft email address to contact “with only urgent questions.”
An unnamed official told NPR that McDonald recently told senior staff of the so-called “Department of Government Efficiency” team that he wants to “claw back” $175 million in grant money that has not been disbursed.
A large number of NEH employees will soon be fired, as well, according to the New York Times. 
Johnson said the news came as a shock and called the cuts “very disappointing,” though he acknowledged he’d withheld much stronger words he wanted to say about the abrupt cancellation of the program. He noted that the NEH has enjoyed bipartisan support for decades and that the council here has done great work across the state.

“That’s money that won’t go to our New Mexico communities,” he said. 
A statement from the National Alliance for the Humanities, an advocacy group, called on members of the public to fight back against the cuts, noting that the spending was already approved by Congress. 
“We condemn these actions in the strongest possible terms,” the alliance wrote. “We support the mission of the National Endowment for the Humanities and the agency staff who make that mission possible, and we call upon Members of Congress to ensure that this crucial government agency fulfills the mandate set by Congress.”",https://sourcenm.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/NMHC-NHD-TopHat_0-4-2-web30.jpg,,,2025-04-03 18:06:33.935065

Kevin Stitt’s proposal to eliminate the state Forestry Service after the Republican criticized its response to wildfires last month.
The legislative remarks came a day after Stitt told reporters he wanted to axe the agency amid frustrations about its response to wind-fueled wildfires that ripped through parts of the state, damaging or destroying over 400 homes. Stitt said he lost a ranch in the blaze. 
He later fired Mark Goeller, the head of the Oklahoma Forestry Service. Goeller has said nothing was held back after Stitt criticized his agency’s response. The agency is responsible for preserving the state’s forests and is the primary state body responsible for wildland fire detection, prevention and suppression. Several firefighters have defended how Goeller handled the historic wave of fires that swept across the state.
Stitt on Wednesday said officials can’t get answers about where the resources were and questioned why the state had the agency, which takes up 33% of the Oklahoma Department of Agriculture, Food and Forestry’s budget to the tune of $75 million a year.
He suggested getting rid of it or giving a portion of the funds directly to local fire departments.
Republican lawmakers on Thursday criticized the suggestion.
“It sounds like a really bad idea to me,” said Senate President Pro Tem Lonnie Paxton, R-Tuttle, a longtime volunteer fire firefighter.
Paxton said the Legislature created the Forestry Service, adding that it is a useful tool for the state.
He said he has had no conversation with Stitt about abolishing it.
It would have been a more prudent course of action to issue a burn ban earlier, Paxton said.
House Speaker Kyle Hilbert, R-Bristow, said elimination of forestry services is “unacceptable.”
Hilbert said he and other lawmakers are hearing from firefighters in their districts “who are frankly furious about what has happened and the insult not only to the Department of Forestry but also to the fire service in general.”
The state needs to fully fund and staff the positions in the Oklahoma Forestry Service, Hilbert said.
The mid-March fires left four dead and injured 200 people, according to the Oklahoma Department of Emergency Management. A state of emergency was declared for 12 counties.

(Photo by Jay Waagmeester/Florida Phoenix)Florida high schoolers would not need to pass algebra or English final exams to graduate under a bill the Florida Senate unanimously passed Thursday.
That proposal is part of SB 166, which its sponsor, Sen. Cory Simon, a Republican representing 13 counties in the Panhandle and Big Bend, called public school “deregulation.”
The bill would remove a state requirement that students pass the Algebra I and 10th grade English finals. Students would still have to pass the classes notwithstanding a failing test score. (The test would count toward 30% of the course grade.)
“As we focus on providing parents with the choice in education, school districts must be given the chance to compete,” Simon said on the Senate floor Thursday. 
Last year, under Speaker Paul Renner, the House rejected removing the testing requirements. ExcelinEd, former Gov. Jeb Bush’s education think tank, opposed the idea then and now. In office, Bush established the A+ Plan for education, which put in place school grades based on student test scores and the Florida Comprehensive Assessment Test.
Several school districts lobbied in support of the bill.
The bill would expand eligibility for teachers’ professional certificates, looks to enhance teacher recruitment, and would remove requirements for schools to have internal auditors. 
Third-graders who score a 1 out of 5 on their third and final reading progress monitoring tests could  advance to fourth grade if they scored a 2 on the first two progress-monitoring tests. A score of 3 is considered “on grade level.”

Students testing like ‘robots’
Simon said adding progress monitoring has allowed teachers to understand in real time how to shape instruction. 
In 2024, 55% of third graders could read at grade level. In 2023, that level was 50%.
“A few years ago, when we passed the universal school choice bill, we made an obligation to parents that we were going to fund students and we were going to fund their choice to choose the school that is best suited for them. Well, 75-to-80% of our parents are choosing our public schools, and it is part of the choice. It’s not the default,” Simon said. 
Focusing on test scores only can turn students into “robots,” Simon said. 
“​​We all learn differently, but we take a test that doesn’t focus on all of our strengths, and so it’s important for us to continue to do this work, making sure that our kids leave our schools, and they’re not defeated, they’re encouraged. They’re emboldened to take on their future,” Simon said. 
The bill looks to “level the playing field amid other school choice options,” Senate President Ben Albritton said in a news release. 
“None of this bill decreases the rigor of what our schools are doing. What we’re saying is, what they’ve done all should add up to something,” Simon told reporters following the vote. 
The bill does not have a companion in the House, which will have to pass it before the governor could sign it into law. 
“Thank you for your leadership and continued work on education and helping our public schools to have an environment where those that are running and trying to create policy to manage the district gets a little relief from all of the things that we mandate on them on the state level, as well as being focused on our children and helping them to learn and grow without overburdening them,” Sen. Rosalind Osgood, a Democrat representing part of Broward County said.

(Screenshot of SCETV legislative livestream)COLUMBIA — A Senate committee on Thursday rejected the governor’s pick to lead the state’s public health agency over criticisms of the state’s response to the COVID-19 pandemic.
After running the Department of Health and Environmental Control for three years, Dr. Edward Simmer was Gov. Henry McMaster’s nominee to run the newly created Department of Public Health.
The second day of Simmer’s confirmation hearing brought a bigger, louder crowd that several times prompted Chairman Danny Verdin to call for decorum, as he both reminded a freshman senator of Senate rules and warned the audience he would clear the room.
The opposition centered around the state’s rollout of the COVID-19 vaccine. Vaccinations were in beginning stages when Simmer took over the department in February 2021.
The 17-member Senate Medical Affairs Committee voted 5-12 against recommending that the Senate confirm Simmer. But that doesn’t automatically reject Simmer’s nomination. It’s essentially on pause indefinitely. The full Senate could decide to take up his confirmation and vote, despite the committee’s disapproval, which is what McMaster is encouraging.
Simmer will remain interim director of the department for the time being.
“I remain resolute in my support of Dr. Ed Simmer and am hopeful that the full Senate will see through the falsehoods and mistruths being spread about his service to our state and nation,” McMaster said in a statement posted to X soon after the vote.
Odds appear to be against Simmer if the full Senate, which has a Republican supermajority, decides to take a vote on his confirmation. Only one of the committee’s 13 Republicans voted in favor of his confirmation Thursday.

“There’s just no way I can sugar coat it,” said Senate Finance Chairman Harvey Peeler, R-Gaffney, before voting against advancing Simmer’s nomination. “I’m not telling you something you don’t already know. Your confirmation is facing an uphill battle.”
Unless a nominee has a glaring issue in their background, senators traditionally give the governor deference in confirming Cabinet nominees, said Sen. Tom Davis, the only Republican to join the panel’s four Democrats in a favorable vote.
“At the end of the day, do you truly think that the governor is in clear error?” the Beaufort Republican said to his fellow senators. “Do you think that he truly has put forward somebody who is unfit? Who is not qualified? Who doesn’t have the competency?”
This is not the first time the Senate has rejected one of McMaster’s nominees to a Cabinet position. In 2020, the full Senate voted 41-2 to reject McMaster’s nominee to run the Department on Aging over accusations that he made derogatory comments to women and minorities, which he denied.
The year before, another Senate committee gave an unfavorable report for McMaster’s pick to lead the board of state-run utility Santee Cooper, citing a lack of experience working for utilities.
Other Cabinet nominees over the years have withdrawn from consideration, knowing they either wouldn’t legally be able to take the role or didn’t have the votes. Among them were McMaster’s 2020 nominees to lead state departments overseeing veterans’ affairs and public safety, as well as former Gov. Nikki Haley’s choice to run DHEC in 2015.
Simmer sailed through the confirmation process in 2021, when senators voted 40-1 to confirm him. When he took the agency’s helm, it had been without a permanent director for eight months.
In his opening statement two weeks ago, and again in answers Thursday, he said his detractors were spreading lies about him and pointed to his accomplishments aside from the COVID-19 pandemic.
“There have been a lot of falsehoods said about me,” Simmer said Thursday. “I think, in the end, the results speak clearly.”
Senators didn’t ask about his background, and they asked little about other problems the state health department addresses, except to compliment the agency’s work. Instead, senators Thursday took aim primarily at the state’s COVID-19 vaccine rollout.
“To be clear, what’s being scrutinized is not your ability to lead the Department of Public Health during ordinary times but during extraordinary times, should another pandemic arise,” said Sen. Richard Cash, R-Piedmont.
Trying to encourage more people to get vaccinated, DHEC deployed mobile vaccination units, set up vaccine booths at events across the state and offered perks such as free beer to people willing to get the jab.
In each case, people getting vaccinated were advised of the possible rare side effects of receiving the COVID-19 vaccine, Simmer said. He never required people to get vaccinated, nor did he support businesses mandating employees and visitors be vaccinated, he said.
What Simmer did was encourage people to get the vaccine if they chose, based on the information he had about it at the time, he said.
“No one forced anyone to get a vaccine,” he said. “I’ve never mandated anyone to get a vaccine.”
What Simmer described as encouragement, Verdin said he and other senators saw as a different sort of mandate, which they opposed.
Some senators repeated debunked claims that the COVID-19 vaccine contains harmful strands of DNA and questioned whether it was wise to offer the shot to children, despite its federal approval for that purpose.
Those concerns demonstrate a larger issue, Verdin said.
Following the pandemic, public trust in the state’s health care system — and, by extension, Simmer — frayed. Senators are looking for a nominee who can rebuild that confidence among the state’s residents, Verdin said.
“We need to enjoy a greater level of trust than we enjoy now, and that’s where I’m going to be putting all my energy and efforts,” the Laurens Republican said.
At issue was not whether Simmer was qualified, Verdin said.
Simmer spent three decades in the Navy, including overseeing Tricare Health Plan, the military’s massive health system for care outside military hospitals. As the head of DHEC, outside of pandemic response, he was very capable and accessible to legislators, Verdin said.
As a naval doctor, Simmer worked in psychiatry, which prompted Peeler to ask whether he might be interested in working instead at the Department of Mental Health, though Peeler didn’t clarify what role he had in mind.
Simmer said he’d leave that decision up to the governor and his wife.",https://scdailygazette.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Screenshot-2025-04-03-at-4.41.35-PM-1024x515.png,,,2025-04-03 18:06:33.935065

(Kyle Martin/For the North Dakota Monitor)A divisive prison sentencing bill introduced by Attorney General Drew Wrigley’s office failed in the House Thursday after more than 90 minutes of debate by lawmakers.
Senate Bill 2128 sought to make sure inmates in the state prison system spend most of their sentence behind bars.
This included a requirement that inmates spend at least half of their sentence in prisons before they can be eligible for a transitional center or parole.
It also contained provisions that would have established steeper penalties for fleeing and assaulting law enforcement.
North Dakota attorney general calls for more prison time; opponents say spend more on police

Earlier this week, the House Judiciary Committee voted 9-5 to forward the bill to House Floor with a do-not-pass recommendation. The House on Thursday rejected an amendment proposed by the committee, which included language giving lawmakers the option to study parole and the state corrections during the upcoming interim session.
“This bill is trying to make too many sweeping changes too quickly,” said Rep. Nels Christianson, R-Grand Forks, who carried the bill on the floor.
Opponents of the bill, which included the head of the North Dakota Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation, have said Wrigley’s proposal would further encumber the state’s already overcrowded prisons. They also said it would have prevented inmates from accessing programs that reduce recidivism and help them prepare for life outside of prison.
“The Attorney General and Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation fundamentally disagree on the facts and the solutions, and we shouldn’t rush to make these sweeping changes to policy with far reaching consequences without having all the facts,” Christianson said.
Proponents of the bill said the proposals would best serve the interests of the public, as well as crime victims.
“We’re talking about the victim here, and the responsibility of the people in blue and brown,” said Rep. Bill Tveit, R-Hazen.
The original bill was estimated to cost the state $22.7 million in the 2025-2027 biennium and another $21.3 million for the 2027-2029 budget cycle.
The Senate in February passed the proposal by a 28-18 vote.

U.S. Reps. Jeff Hurd, Lauren Boebert, Jeff Crank and Gabe Evans sent the letter to Polis, a Democrat, on Wednesday asking him to reject Senate Bill 25-3, which has been passed by both chambers of the Legislature.
“Despite making some amendments to the legislation to appear less restrictive, the Colorado State Legislature proceeded with a partisan vote to pass one of the most restrictive gun ownership laws in the United States — on par with California and Illinois’ gun laws. The bill would impose a deceptive ‘permit-to-purchase’ system riddled with bureaucratic hurdles and impedes our constituents’ ability to freely exercise their right to self-defense,” the letter, first reported by Colorado Politics, reads.

SB-3 would limit the ability to purchase semiautomatic firearms with detachable magazines to those who have completed a safety training course — either four hours of training if they already have a hunter safety license or 12 hours if they do not. It would not criminalize possession, but it would be one of the largest changes to Colorado’s gun purchasing laws in recent years.
The bill originally would have outlawed those guns with detachable magazines outright, but it was amended in the Senate to create the permit-to-purchase system. It passed the Senate and House on partisan votes, with some Democrats joining Republicans in opposition.
It now sits on Polis’ desk for him to sign into law or veto. A bill can become law without the governor’s schedule after 10 days. It was officially sent to Polis on Thursday.
The congressional Republicans wrote that the process laid out in the bill is burdensome, time-consuming, potentially costly and violates the Second Amendment. A person would need to undergo a background check and obtain an eligibility card from their sheriff before they could enroll in a class. Sheriffs could deny applicants if they believe the person is a danger to themselves or others.
“Not only does this new scheme come with additional fees and time commitments that no criminal will ever participate in, but it also gives any sheriff hostile to the individual — or semi-automatic firearms in general — carte blanche authority to block the enrollment,” they wrote.
Polis spokesperson Shelby Wieman wrote in a statement that the governor welcomes input on legislation that comes before him.
“The Governor was clear he would oppose banning any guns, and his team worked with the sponsors, and got feedback from the hunting and sport shooting community, and members of law enforcement to amend the bill to address the overarching concerns, remove any bans on guns, and ensure people could continue to purchase the gun of their choice. The final bill allows responsible Coloradans to continue to purchase the gun of their choice as long as they receive gun safety education,” she wrote.
Members of Congress do not often weigh in directly on matters at the state Legislature, unless a bill is especially controversial or consequential. Democratic Reps. Diana DeGette and Brittany Pettersen lent their support last month to Senate Bill 25-5, which would eliminate a second election required in the union organization process. That bill passed the Senate but has not been debated on the House floor. Polis has expressed desire for labor and business groups to work out a compromise on the issue.
The legislative session ends in about one month.

(Perry Bennett | West Virginia Legislative Photography)Funding for foster care has been slashed in the House Finance Committee as members opted to ignore Gov. Patrick Morrisey’s proposed budget, including his $182 million request for a child welfare system in crisis. 
There are more than 5,800 children in foster care, and there aren’t enough Child Protective Services workers, in-state available beds or services to help them. 
The House’s version of the fiscal year 2026 budget, up for passage this week, would give roughly $121 million to the Department of Human Services to manage its foster care system. 
The governor’s proposed budget was still less than what the department needed. It proposed $3 million for CPS, which was less than a third of what the agency had said it needed to hire more than 100 new CPS workers. The state’s CPS workers are often managing overwhelming caseloads.
Now, the agency could have to operate with even less.
Angelica Hightower, a DoHS spokesperson, said the original $182 million requested by the governor was “essential funding” to meet the ongoing needs of the Bureau for Social Services, including serving children in foster care and operating critical services for families. 
“In contrast, the proposed budget reduction put forward by the House Finance Committee would significantly hinder the department’s ability to deliver services effectively and respond to the pressing challenges currently facing the foster care system,” Hightower said. 
House Finance Chairman Vernon Criss, R-Wood, disregarded Morrisey’s budget, opting for the House to present its own budget bill that includes a surplus “cushion,” as he put it. “It’s our job to tell him how much money to spend,” he said. 
Criss said his committee looked at last year’s foster care funding to determine what to allocate for the upcoming fiscal year. 
“We didn’t necessarily take cuts from what he did, but what we did was ignore his budget entirely and used our ‘25 budget to drive a ‘26 budget,” he explained.
  Del. John Williams, D-Monongalia
Del. John Williams, D-Monongalia, minority chair of the House Finance Committee, said that skinny budgets passed under Gov. Jim Justice meant that foster care had already been underfunded. Foster care can’t be fixed without putting money into it, he said. 
“When you have any foster kids living out of trash bags in a hotel, that is not a point in time in which you give tax breaks to the rich,” he said. “These programs are struggling.”
Morissey, when responding to a question from West Virginia Watch on Thursday, said that he put forth a “common sense proposal” on foster care funding. The state may need more funding to make positive changes to foster care, CPS and more, he said.
“My philosophy … is that when you have ongoing programs, you generally try to have ongoing revenue that matches. And that’s what we’re trying to do,” Morrisey said.
Kelly Allen, executive director of the West Virginia Center on Budget and Policy, said the House’s budget bill fell short of what was needed to truly improve child welfare outcomes. She cited more than $50 million in proposed cuts to Medicaid along with no new financial investments in public education.
“The ability to make those investments is hindered by a stubborn commitment to keeping the budget flat, even if that leaves critical needs unfunded,” she said. “Without making much-needed investments in evidence-based primary supports, it will be challenging to stem the untenable flow of children into our overburdened foster care system.”

Some line item increases for CPS and other child welfare
The House’s budget bill does include a few million dollars more specifically for CPS workers than what was requested by Morrisey. It also includes $5 million for guardians ad litems, which are attorneys who represent the interests of children in child welfare court proceedings. There’s also $1.8 million allocated to Court Appointed Special Advocates, or CASA, a volunteer program that helps abused and neglected children in the court system. 
  Del. Adam Burkhammer, R-Lewis
“I am glad to see we are making some investments in child welfare, specifically for our [guardian ad litems] and CASA. I can always wish that we would have received more for child welfare but these allocations shouldn’t be overlooked. Any investment is a step in the right direction,” said Del. Adam Burkhammer, R-Lewis, a foster parent who has spearheaded child welfare legislation this session.  
Criss said he felt confident that DoHS would be able to adequately operate the foster care system under the House’s proposed budget.
“If not, we’ll be back in January, [and] there’ll be additional supplementals at that time,” he said. “We know that we’ve got a $100 million surplus in the current year.  If there’s monies left over, we’ll be able to maneuver and take care of things as things move along, and in January, we’ll have a better picture.”
The Senate’s budget version, vetted by the Senate Finance Committee on Thursday, would fund foster care at the same level requested by the governor.
Morrisey said he believed that issues with foster care funding would be resolved by the end of lawmakers’ budget process. The legislative session is scheduled to adjourn April 12.
“There are some differences ….  I’m hopeful that as time goes on, the different parties are going to get together. I think that they will,” the governor said.  
Jaycie Bias is the executive director of the WV Foster, Adoptive & Kinship Parents Network, which represents 1,800 families.
Funding isn’t the issue, from her point of view. Instead, the state needs to focus on improving the quality of the foster care system. CPS workers are failing to check on children living in foster homes, she said, and reimbursement payments to foster families are irregular. 
“There are statues in place that aren’t being followed through,” she said. “The state is doing so little for us in terms of follow through that you are having people fall through the cracks.”
While the state struggles to have enough foster homes, Bias said DoHS prioritizing and communicating with those who are willing to foster — which doesn’t take money — would likely solve that problem.

On Wednesday, the Great Lakes advocacy organization For Love of Water — or FLOW — announced it had filed an application for leave to appeal with the Michigan Supreme Court. The Bay Mills Indian Community, Little Traverse Bay Bands of Odawa Indians, Grand Traverse Band of Ottawa and Chippewa Indians, and the Nottawaseppi Huron Band of the Potawatomi also filed a separate application for leave to appeal alongside the Environmental Law and Policy Center and the Michigan Climate Action Network.

For many years, Native American tribes and environmental advocates have called for a shutdown to the pipeline, which transports more than 22 million gallons of crude oil and light synthetic crude daily from northern Wisconsin through the Upper and Lower Peninsula into Sarnia, Ontario. 
About four miles of the 645-mile long pipeline runs through the Straits of Mackinac, where Lake Huron and Lake Michigan meet. The pipeline’s opponents have repeatedly warned that a spill into the Great Lakes would be catastrophic with a University of Michigan study finding the Straits would be the “worst possible place” for a Great Lakes oil spill, quickly contaminating nearby shorelines, with another study finding a spill could bring more than $6 billion in damage to the environment and local economies.
Additionally, a 2018 anchor strike which dented the pipeline in three places generated further concerns of a spill, with Enbridge later agreeing to replace the dual pipelines running through the Straits with a new segment inside a concrete-lined tunnel located beneath the lakebed in hopes of containing any spills. 
In order to move forward, the project must receive permits from the Department of Environment, Great Lakes and Energy, the United States Army Corps of Engineers and the Michigan Public Service Commission, the state’s energy regulator. 
Attorneys representing the tribes and environmental organizations argued the Commission had blocked them from presenting evidence challenging the public’s need for petroleum products transported by Line 5 and detailing the scope of the project’s environmental impact, and that the commission failed to consider the pipeline’s impacts on climate change and greenhouse gasses alongside evidence supporting alternatives to the tunnel.
However, the three judge panel hearing the case determined there was “no basis to reverse or remand” the commission’s permitting decision.
In its request to the Michigan Supreme Court, attorneys representing the tribes argue the Public Service Commission failed to properly consider the risk of oil spills when approving the project, violating the state constitution and state laws requiring agencies to protect the state’s natural resources from pollution and destruction.
“Even if the public has been misled into believing this tunnel project is safe, the truth is that it is not,” Whitney Gravelle, president of the Bay Mills Indian Community said in a statement.

 “Enbridge’s track record speaks for itself—catastrophic spills, environmental destruction, and a complete disregard for tribal sovereignty and the rights of future generations,” Gravelle said. “The Straits of Mackinac are not just a waterway; they are the heart of creation for Anishinaabe people and a vital source of life for all who depend on the Great Lakes. An oil spill here would be devastating, not only to our way of life but to the entire region.”

The Michigan Climate Action Network and the Environmental Law & Policy Center argued the Court of Appeals’ decision does not follow the Michigan Environmental Protection Act’s requirement of rigorous, independent determinations of all likely environmental effects of Enbridge’s proposed tunnel project.
“We are asking the Michigan Supreme Court to accept this appeal so that it can provide much needed guidance on the proper interpretation and application of Michigan’s Environmental Protection Act,” said David Scott, a senior attorney for the environmental law and policy center. “We hope that the Supreme Court will review this case because it involves important environmental, health, and welfare issues for the people of Michigan, and important legal issues for Michigan courts to properly and consistently fulfill their responsibility under the Environmental Protection Act.”
In its own brief, FLOW argues the commission is obligated to follow the public trust doctrine under common law, which requires the state to manage natural resources for the benefit of the public.
“The Great Lakes are a public resource of incalculable value,” FLOW’s Legal Director Carrie La Seur said in a statement. “The MPSC has a fundamental responsibility to protect these waters, and its decision-making must be guided by the public trust doctrine. The Court of Appeals’ ruling dangerously undermines that responsibility.”
Enbridge spokesperson Ryan Duffy told the Michigan Advance in an email that the Court of Appeals correctly affirmed the Commission’s permitting decision. 
“The Michigan Court of Appeals concluded that the MPSC appropriately examined the location of the Line 5 replacement segment within the Great Lakes Tunnel, consistent with Michigan law,” Duffy said. 
“As we proceed with this modernization project, we remain committed to operating Line 5 responsibly with enhanced safety measures in the Straits that protect Michigan’s natural resources and infrastructure in the Straits,” he said. 
While the tunnel project has also received permits from EGLE, the Department is currently reviewing two applications, one to redo its Wetlands Protection and Great Lakes Bottomlands permits and another for its National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System permit, which is intended to protect water quality by limiting the amount of pollutants that can be discharged into a body of water.
The United States Army Corps of Engineers is still working to develop a draft environmental impact statement for the project, after announcing in March 2023 that it would extend its environmental review of the effort. The Corps is expected to issue the draft state this spring, though environmentalists and tribal nations have raised concerns that the Corps could fast track its consideration of the project following an executive order from President Donald Trump. 
“The federal government is bending over backwards to fast track required permits in support of a Canadian company’s fossil fuel project that provides minimal benefit to domestic energy production,” said David Gover, managing for the Native American Rights Fund. “But today, it’s up to Michigan’s courts and elected leadership to be responsible public stewards for clean water, for Tribal rights, and for every community along the Great Lakes.”

(Brian Lyman/Alabama Reflector)The leader of the Alabama Senate said Thursday there would be no efforts to create a lottery or expand gambling in the state in the current legislative session.
Senate President Pro Tempore Garlan Gudger, R-Cullman, said in a statement emailed after the chamber adjourned Thursday that passing gambling legislation in the chamber will require “long-term and intense negotiations among members” and votes to be secured before beginning another legislative session.
“With 12 meeting days remaining in the session, both budgets still awaiting approval, and other important bills and measures demanding focus and attention, the comprehensive gaming bill released today is simply too little, too late, and has too few votes to pass,” Gudger said in the statement.
The Senate leader’s statement came as Sen. Greg Albritton, R-Atmore, had been shopping what he described as a “trimmed-down” version of a gambling package filed last year that failed to pass the Legislature.  That package included a constitutional amendment and legislation to legalize a state lottery and gambling, which stalled in the Senate.

Albritton did not push back against Gudger’s statement in a phone interview Thursday afternoon, saying that “the last part of that phrase is the most accurate.”
He also confirmed he’s not introducing a bill in the 2025 legislative session.
“We’re not going to drop a bill this year,” Albritton said.
The gambling package failed last year amid disputes over what kinds of gambling would be offered and distribution of revenues. House sponsors were sharply critical of changes the Senate made to the package, and House Speaker Nathaniel Ledbetter, R-Rainsville, said in February that the chamber would not bring its own version of the legislation. 
The state’s 1901 Constitution outlaws lotteries and gambling. Gambling that exists in the state operates under local constitutional amendments or on land owned by the Poarch Band of Creek Indians, a federally-recognized tribe that runs casinos in Atmore, Montgomery and Wetumpka. Efforts to create a lottery or expand gambling have been stymied by divisions among Republicans in the Legislature; disputes among gambling interests and disagreements over distribution of gambling revenue.
Alabama is the only state east of the Mississippi without a lottery.

(Kyle Martin/For the North Dakota Monitor)The North Dakota House of Representatives on Thursday voted 15-78 against a bill to give a tax cut to prison industries, sustaining Gov. Kelly Armstrong’s first veto in office.
Senate Bill 2261 would have provided businesses tax credits when they buy goods or services from Rough Rider Industries, a state agency that sells various products made by prison inmates. The tax credit would be equal to up to 10% of the cost of the purchase. The bill cleared the Senate with nearly unanimous support, and passed the House with about 63% support.
Armstrong issued the veto March 21, calling the tax incentive anti-competitive.
“This bill creates an uneven playing field by giving Rough Rider Industries an unfair competitive advantage over out-of-state manufacturers,” he wrote in the letter, which is addressed to Lt. Gov. Michelle Strinden, who is president of the Senate.
The Senate a few days later voted 45-2 to override the veto.

“The only thing this bill suggested was that if you’re an in-state manufacturer and looking for somebody to subcontract some of your equipment, some of your parts, that Rough Rider could be the folks you want to go to,” Sen. Jerry Klein, R-Fessenden said on the Senate floor. “Not only will that keep the folks at Rough Rider busy, but once again it’s training, giving those inmates valuable experience.”
Rep. Emily O’Brien, R-Grand Forks, spoke against the bill on the Floor on Thursday. 
She said Rough Rider Industries didn’t ask for the tax credit and that the business is already successful.
“It will not bring in any new business,” she said. “All we’ll do is give a tax credit to companies that are already doing business with Rough Rider Industries, and it will not address our workforce shortages that we are seeing continually.”

Chip Campsen, Majority Leader Shane Massey and Stephen Goldfinch chat in the Senate chamber. The Senate passed legislation Thursday, April 3, 2025, clearing the path for a new power plant and addressing the future of energy in the rapidly growing state. (File/Mary Ann Chastain/SC Daily Gazette)COLUMBIA — The Senate passed a long-anticipated bill clearing the path for a new power plant in South Carolina and fulfilling its pledge to address future energy needs in the rapidly growing Palmetto State.
The legislation, approved 41-3, saw major changes to the sweeping energy bill halted last session over criticism that proponents had fast-tracked it through the General Assembly. Backers say it strikes a balance, empowering utilities charged with meeting the state’s energy needs but in a way that’s more palatable to consumer and environmental advocates.
The three Republicans voting “no” included Senate Majority Leader Shane Massey.
“We still have concerns but it’s nothing like what it would have been,” said Frank Knapp, president of the state’s Small Business Chamber of Commerce, who advocates on behalf of small business owners in the state.
The bill, sponsored by GOP House Speaker Murrell Smith of Sumter gives permission for Dominion Energy and state-owned utility company Santee Cooper to partner on a possible 2,000-megawatt natural gas plant on the site of a former coal-fired power plant along the Edisto River in Colleton County.
Santee Cooper customers should expect a double cost hike in 2025 after years of frozen rates

In its original form, the legislation saw significant pushback on its sweeping regulatory changes and rollback of consumer protections passed in the wake of South Carolina’s failed nuclear expansion.
A nuclear failure
Santee Cooper and Dominion’s predecessor, South Carolina Electric & Gas, abandoned an expansion of the V.C. Summer nuclear plant in Fairfield County in 2017, but not before they’d already jointly spent $9 billion. The debacle left power customers on the hook for much of that cost on a power plant that never produced a single kilowatt.
Angered by the failure, which was fraught with fraud and cost overruns, legislators cracked down. They fired and replaced the state’s utility regulators, loosened the leash on the state’s utility watchdog and put an extra set of eyes looking out for power customers in the state’s consumer protection agency.
As originally proposed, the House bill would have undone some of that work, consumer groups warned.
In response to those concerns, new committee-level leadership in the House made its own changes: keeping the consumer advocate in place and doing away with a proposal that would have reduced the size of the panel regulating power companies in the state.
Here’s how much SC power customers are still paying for a failed nuclear project

The Senate, in a debate that stretched nearly until midnight Wednesday, tweaked the House legislation further after leadership cautioned against changes that could swing the law too far in power companies’ favor following the nuclear fiasco.
“Those who are Santee Cooper or Dominion customers, you are paying for V.C. Summer. You’re going to be paying for V.C. Summer for the next 14 years even though you’re not getting anything from it. And now the proposal is that we pay to build a new gas plant at Canadys,” said Massey, R-Edgefield. “That is my biggest heartburn on this.”
“They’re essentially going to be asking, if not forcing, customers to pay for two power plants when they only needed one,” he added.
The companies will still need the OK of state regulators to begin construction, as well as state and federal permits to connect to an interstate natural gas line needed to fuel the plant.
The other two Republicans voting “no” were Sens. Shane Martin of Spartanburg County and Tom Corbin of Greenville County. Massey, who co-led a Senate investigation into the V.C. Summer debacle, voted against it over his continued disgust over the nuclear fallout, but not before pushing for major changes.
Data center demand
Among those Senate changes are limitations on power-related incentives the state allows for data centers.
Massey said the amendment mirrors efforts by utility regulators in Georgia to say the cost of providing electricity to these centers, full of power-gobbling computer servers that run technologies ranging from artificial intelligence and 5G streaming of videos on mobile devices to high-speed financial trades, is borne by those companies.
Utility executives have testified that the largest of these centers can use upwards of 200 megawatts each and are a driving force, over and above residential and manufacturing growth, behind the state’s need for more power.
Sen. Chip Campsen, R-Isle of Palms, told the Senate that power usage by data centers in South Carolina is equivalent to 65% of demand from residential customers.
Data centers gobble up energy. Should SC block them from getting special deals?

At the same time, Dominion brokered a discount electricity deal for a $510 million Google data center proposed near Summerville. The deal, approved by utility regulators last year, allowed the Virginia-headquartered utility to grant Google a special “economic development rider” rate — 6 cents for every kilowatt hour, compared to 14 cents that residential customers were paying at the time.
Utilities have said, even if data centers don’t come, South Carolina will need more power to meet federal regulations requiring them to eventually shut down coal-fired plants in favor of more carbon-friendly options.
But if more of these center for come to the state after May 30, 2025, Massey said he wants them to pay an equivalent share of the costs for power plants built to serve them.
Permitting power
Still, the bill contains some wins for utility companies, too.
It starts by setting time limits on the environmental permitting process, as well as lawsuits that power executives testified are often used to drag out the building of new power plants and natural gas pipelines for decades, to the point that theconstruction projects are no longer financially feasible.
The House took steps to limit the permitting timeline to six months.
SC nuclear reboot sees interest from big tech, large utilities

To appease environmental concerns, the Senate passed an amendment to say the clock doesn’t start until regulators deem an environmental application is completely filled out. The change came after the Conservation Voters of South Carolina said it’s not uncommon for companies to submit these applications while they’re still missing all of the information needed to evaluate them.
The Senate also added a provision urging South Carolina’s court system to handle legal appeals of permitting decisions within a year’s time. And the bill pulls the state Appeals Court from the series of courts that hear these cases.
“I do think that the appellate process has been abused and and that’s why I think we ought to shorten that process,” Massey said.
Paying for power
Finally, the Senate added a section to the bill that would make it easier for utilities to raise power bills on an annual basis.
In their pitch, utility executives testified about comments from customers made during the company’s recent rate hike. Dominion’s South Carolina President Keller Kissam said customers asked why the utility didn’t raise rates on a smaller but more frequent basis, making it easier for those on a fixed income to adjust.

Kissam said the state uses a similar process for natural gas rates.
Utilities would go before regulators annually for up to five years to seek permission to raise prices. Rate payers can still protest and regulators still have the final say so over whether expenses meet the necessary requirements for an increase. But the process is less in depth because it doesn’t call into question a utility company’s allowed profit margin.
The process includes a cap. So, unlike the legislation that paved the way for the V.C. Summer debacle, it can’t be used to pay for a major project, such as the proposed Canadys gas plant, while it’s still under construction.
Consumer advocates, environmental groups and businesses organizations, large and small, opposed the measure.
They argued, while gradual annual increases might ease the burden for customers, power companies also would be less incentivized to hold down costs.
The state would review the process after five years to determine if its working the way utilities claim.

(Photo by Baylor Spears/Wisconsin Examiner) Justice Ann Walsh Bradley will retire from the Wisconsin Supreme Court in July with one more title on her curriculum vitae: chief justice.
Bradley, the Court’s most senior member, was elected by her colleagues Thursday to serve as the leader of the Court. She’ll succeed outgoing Chief Justice Annette Ziegler, whose second two-year term in the top position ends April 30.
Bradley’s term will run about two months starting May 1, and she’ll step down June 30 in anticipation of her retirement. In preparation for that, the justices also elected Justice Jill Karofsky to fill out the remainder of the two-year chief justice term, ending April 30, 2027. 
Both Bradley and Karofsky, who was elected to the Court in 2020, are members of the Court’s liberal majority. 
From the late 19th century to the mid-2010s, the state Supreme Court’s chief justice had been selected by seniority. In 2015, a constitutional amendment drafted by the Legislature’s Republican majority changed the selection process to a majority vote of the Court’s seven justices. The amendment also instituted a two-year term for the chief justice.
The amendment was aimed at unseating Justice Shirley Abrahamson, the Court’s first woman justice. Abrahamson had been chief justice since 1996, the second-longest to serve in the position. After voters ratified the amendment in April 2015, a majority of the justices — at the time, five conservatives — elected Justice Pat Roggensack chief. They reelected her in 2019, then elected Ziegler as her successor in 2021.
Bradley said in a statement that her election as chief justice is a “tremendous honor.”
“It has been my life’s goal to honor the rule of law, enhance access to justice, and serve the 5.9 million people who call Wisconsin home,” Bradley said. “Serving as Chief Justice enables me to further those goals.” 
Bradley also participated in her final oral arguments Thursday morning, where Ziegler delivered kind words about her and called attention to her thorough resume and accomplishments
Prior to her time in law, Bradley served as a high school teacher before earning her law degree at UW-Madison Law School in 1976. Bradley worked in private practice, as a city attorney and as a public defender, including being appointed to the state public defender board in 1983.
In 1985, Bradley was appointed to serve as a circuit court judge in Marathon County. 
Bradley won her first term on the Wisconsin Supreme Court in 1995, and was reelected for two consecutive terms in 2005 and 2015. She decided to retire this year and will be succeeded by Justice-elect Susan Crawford, who defeated her challenger Brad Schimel Tuesday ensuring a 4-3 liberal majority on the Court until at least 2028. 
Ziegler said Bradley has likely heard over 2,400 cases in oral arguments, give or take some cases, during her many years of service.
“I can assure you it’s quite impressive,” Ziegler said. “I don’t know how many opinions that you’ve written, Justice Ann Walsh Bradley, but that number is also certainly impressive, and so, I would like to thank you Justice Ann Walsh Bradley for your service to the public and your service on this court.” 
Bradley thanked Ziegler and said that it’s been an honor to serve. She also thanked her husband and family for their support throughout the years. 
“People ask me, ‘Will you miss this place and miss this job?’ And, of course, I will,” Bradley said. “What makes this job is not only the heavy responsibility and an opportunity to serve, but an opportunity to serve with people who care deeply about the rule of law and care deeply about the people of this state.”
Karofsky said in a statement about her election to serve as chief justice that she appreciates the confidence of her colleagues and she will “continue to work respectfully with every member of this Court to ensure the administration of Court business is conducted in a fair and efficient manner.” 
“The people of Wisconsin have great faith in this Court, and I intend to be a Chief that increases the people’s confidence even further,” Karofsky said. “I hope to be someone that every judge and staff person in the judicial system finds approachable, so we can continue to improve the service we provide in all 72 counties, keeping each of us safe and ensuring access to justice.”

(Photo by Leah Romero / Source NM)Attorney General Raúl Torrez is seeking restitution for veterans he alleges were defrauded by a consulting company based in Las Cruces.
Torrez filed a civil suit against Disabled Veterans Consultants, Inc. Thursday claiming the company violated the Unfair Practices Act by using unfair and deceptive trade practices and unconscionable trade practices. During a press conference in Las Cruces, Torrez said the company offers consulting services to veterans to help access their benefits. However, the company is not accredited with the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs as they are required to be to charge for services. And such services are provided to veterans for free through various agencies, including Veterans of Foreign Wars, American Legion and Disabled American Veterans.
Torrez described the company as a “claimshark,” or “organizations who prey upon our veterans in their moment of need when they’re trying to access the disability benefits that they’re entitled to as a result of their service to our country.” He said such companies often offer to process claims on behalf of veterans for large fees or percentages of the person’s benefits.
“Sadly, this country has not invested enough in supporting our veterans. This country, indeed, this state, has not invested enough in supporting our veterans,” Torrez said. “We have men and women who have honorably served this country who have disabilities as a result of their service who don’t realize or may not have access to free services to help.”
Court documents also state that payments the company received from veterans were not made to the company itself, but to Zeplin Global Group, LLC; MJJL Holdings, LLC; and GTM Bookkeeping, LLC – codefendants in the suit and all based out of Chula Vista, California. 
Torrez is asking the court to grant an injunction to prohibit the company from continuing to operate in such a manner. According to court documents, Torrez is asking that the company issue full refunds to the impacted veterans, cancel all contracts and pay fines of up to $5,000 per violation.
“The action that we have taken today is intended to send a very clear signal to claimsharks, both in this community in Las Cruces, but around the state, that this kind of conduct will not be tolerated by my office,” Torrez said. “We will be aggressively investigating anyone who is engaged in this conduct.”
Brian Ravak, state commander of the Veterans of Foreign Wars, told members of the media during Thursday’s press conference that state and federal legislation should be passed to further protect veterans from bad actors.
“The VFW, along with the American Legion and [Disabled American Veterans], have actively urged Congress to pass legislation that would prohibit the exploitation of veterans and survivors of unscrupulous claimsharks and strengthen the accreditation system,” Ravak said. “Each of our organizations have accredited veteran service officers who file VA claims for free – not one dime of a veteran’s benefits goes to a veteran service organization.”
He also mentioned House Bill 245, legislation introduced during the recent session that died in the House Judiciary Committee, which would have prohibited companies or individuals from asking for payment for helping a veteran obtain their benefits, unless they were permitted to ask for compensation under federal law.
Ravak said he will “demand” the bill be reintroduced in a future legislative session.
At least three states have passed such legislation, while Louisiana passed a law last year that would allow consulting companies to charge veterans up to $12,500 in fees for benefit services.
Torrez said the case against the Las Cruces company is still in the early stages and it is unclear at this point how many veterans may have been taken advantage of. 
“I can tell you that while this is the first action that we’ve taken against a claimshark in this space, it almost certainly won’t be the last,” he said. 
He added that the state and federal government have expanded eligibility for benefit claims, but have not increased capacity for processing the higher number of claims, creating an “opportunity for businesses like this, and unethical and unscrupulous people, to step into that space and take advantage of folks.”
Torrez said veterans are encouraged to reach out to his office if they have a complaint about how their benefits were processed, particularly if they were asked to sign over a portion of their benefits to a consultant.

(Photo by Bill Oxford/ Getty Images)Following reports that mass firings at the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services wiped out the entire staff of the federal low income heating assistance program, Maine’s two senators sent a letter to the head of the agency warning of potentially devastating consequences. 
The Low Income Heating Assistance Program (LIHEAP) is federally funded and provides financial assistance to help lower income households afford energy bills, weatherization, and energy-related home repairs. 
Republican Susan Collins and independent Angus King, along with 11 of their Senate colleagues, penned a letter to Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. on Thursday, urging him to “reverse course on any staffing or funding cuts that would jeopardize the distribution of these funds to our constituents.”
While the program remains in effect, its roughly 20 federal staffers were reportedly among the approximately 10,000 HHS workers terminated this week as part of a mass layoff to make the agency “more responsive and efficient.” 
The senators wrote that, if true, the terminations “will undermine the HHS’s ability to deliver this critical funding to low-income seniors and families.” In addition, they noted that local community action programs that help enroll qualified residents could also be weakened by cuts undertaken by HHS and billionaire advisor Elon Musk’s Department of Government Efficiency, or DOGE. 
Maine has seen a sizable increase in applications for LIHEAP in recent years, jumping from 45,000 in 2019 to 70,000 in the past year, according to the Maine State Housing Authority.
For fiscal year 2025, Maine was awarded about $37.6 million in LIHEAP funds with an additional $1.4 million for the Wabanaki Nations, according to Collins’ office. 
In the letter, the senators noted that states “are expecting HHS to release nearly $400 million in FY25 funding later this month. Any delay in providing this funding will set back efforts to provide summer cooling grants, weatherize low-income homes, and plan for the next winter heating season.”

(Photo by Jay Waagmeester/Florida Phoenix)Testimony from the author of the 2022 report detailing how Florida property insurers gave millions to shareholders and billions to out-of-state affiliates while claiming financial ruin left some lawmakers on a House panel Thursday feeling like insurance regulators had lied to them.
The report at issue has prompted legislators to seek greater oversight over the flow of money from insurers to affiliates. House members have also questioned former and sitting insurance commissioners, who struggled to explain why they didn’t bring attention to the reports’ findings in 2022.
Jan Moenck, who wrote the report for Risk & Regulatory Consulting, told the Insurance & Banking Subcommittee Thursday that the firm submitted to the Office of Insurance Regulation its final draft on April 1, 2022, and didn’t receive any feedback or requests for changes, so RRC considered its work done.
Insurance regulators struggle to explain why stunning 2022 report wasn’t made public

That statement from Moenck prompted more questions from committee members, who heard testimony in March from OIR’s former and sitting heads that the report hadn’t been published because it was a draft and needed further review before release.
“You’re at your final draft, so it is inaccurate for them to have said you were not finished. So either they weren’t telling us the truth or you weren’t telling the truth. Which one was that?” Riverview Republican Rep. Danny Alvarez asked Moenck.
“In our mind, we had our final draft,” Moenck responded under oath.
House wants to dig deeper
The report sat until a Tampa Bay Times article brought it to the surface, highlighting how property insurers claimed losses following hurricanes Irma in 2017 and Michael in 2018, yet had paid $680 million in dividends to shareholders and billions in fees to affiliated companies for basic services.
The panel signaled that it would try to get more answers from OIR, with the subcommittee chair, Port Richey Republican Rep. Brad Yeager, telling reporters that the lack of communication from the regulating office after RRC submitted the final draft was telling.

Additionally, Yeager said, House Speaker Daniel Perez had authorized the subcommittee to find a firm to investigate shortcomings in the way regulators monitor insurer-affiliate relationships.
Tampa Democratic Rep. Dianne Hart, during the Thursday meeting, asked whether there would be more testimony from OIR.
“What is being revealed basically says they lied to us. They had a completed report and did not let us know that it was completed,” she said.
Not all lawmakers are convinced the Legislature should continue delving into the affiliate relationships. Delray Beach Republican Rep. Mike Caruso, a close ally of Gov. Ron DeSantis, used air quotes when talking about the investigation House Speaker Daniel Perez called for the subcommittee to carry out.
Caruso said some of the insurance companies that appeared to syphon money to their affiliates were paying them to do all of the claims processing.
What is OIR saying?
But OIR Commissioner Michael Yaworsky, who assumed the role in early 2023, rejected the notion in a phone interview with the Phoenix that he lied to lawmakers. He told the panel on March 14 that OIR in 2022 was dealing with the insolvency of several companies and investigating other insurers.
“If there’s a thought out there that OIR, or an OIR employee, or myself lied to them, that’s just not accurate,” Yawaorsky said. “I think what we’re getting caught up in is the mechanics of how projects such as these are completed, typically.”

The commissioner maintains that the report doesn’t provide a full picture because several insurers didn’t provide any or all information required for the analysis, which he emphasized wasn’t Moenck’s fault.
“There was extensive back and forth between the office and Moenck up to a certain point, and I think it seemed like it was the point that the market was collapsing that that communication stopped,” he said. “It did seem to stop at a point with no additional follow-ups.”
David Altmaier, OIR commissioner in 2022, echoed Yaworsky’s sentiment about the frenzy in the industry at the time the office received the report.
“Hindsight being 20/20, there’s probably some opportunities where I could have poked a little bit to make sure that this work was continuing. But, as the commissioner said, we were dealing with a lot,” Altmaier told lawmakers last month.
Months after the office had the report, the Legislature met for a special session in December that resulted in changes making it harder for policyholders to sue insurers, who claimed frivolous lawsuits drove up insurance premiums.
Lawmakers in the Insurance & Banking Subcommittee advanced a proposal, HB 881, that would require insurers to demonstrate that fees, commissions, and other payments to affiliates are fair and reasonable. The statutory lack of definition of fair and reasonable fees has also been at the center of discussions in the Legislature this year.
The bill approved Thursday states that when weighing whether a fee or commission is fair and reasonable, OIR must look at the actual cost of the service the affiliate provided to the insurer, the financial condition of both companies, the level of debt, the amount and purpose of payments and dividends, whether the contract benefits the insurer, and other information the office needs to made the determination.
However, similar bills appear stalled in the Senate at the midway point of the session.
Yaworsky said the office would have a difficult time complying with a legislative demand to produce a similar report with more recent data.
“We’re a pretty cash-strapped agency, and the House currently has us set to lose 20 full-time employees in their budget,” he said.

,DC,2025-04-03 20:41:01+00:00,News From The States - Fair. Fearless. Free.,U.S. Senate confirms Dr. Oz to lead Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services,Jennifer Shutt,,,,,https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/us-senate-confirms-dr-oz-lead-centers-medicare-medicaid-services,,"WASHINGTON — The U.S. Senate on Thursday confirmed former television personality and onetime Pennsylvania political candidate Mehmet Oz as director of the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services.The 53-45 party-line vote places Oz at the helm of the federal agency responsible for administering health care programs relied on by 1 in 4 Americans, including children, seniors and lower-income people.His confirmation comes as Republicans in Congress look to Medicaid, a state-federal partnership that covers medical expenses for some low-income and older Americans, as a source for hundreds of billions in spending cuts to help pay for extending the 2017 GOP tax law.Oz testified during his confirmation hearing in mid-March that there are several “painful truths” confronting federal programs within CMS.“Health care expenditures are growing 2 to 3% faster than our economy; not sustainable. The Medicare trust fund will be insolvent within a decade, that’s the 2.9% taken out of your paycheck,” Oz said. “Medicaid is the number one expense item in most states, consuming 30% of those state budgets, and that’s crowding out essential services like schools and public safety that many of you spent your careers trying to develop. Our health care cost per person in this country is twice that of other developed nations.”Oz said that chronic disease, which he argued is “linked to poor lifestyle choices,” drives much of the federal spending on health care. He singled out obesity as a central issue.Oz testified he intended to “empower beneficiaries with better tools and more transparency,” “incentivize health care providers to optimize care with real-time information” in part by using artificial intelligence to “liberate doctors and nurses from paperwork,” and modernize efforts that track waste, fraud and abuse.‘Ludicrous wellness grifting’Finance Committee ranking member Ron Wyden, D-Ore., said during the hearing that Oz’s comments during a failed Senate campaign about privatizing Medicare were unacceptable.Wyden also criticized Oz for promoting products on this daytime television show that had no scientific research supporting their claims of improving people’s health or preventing disease.  “Dr. Oz has used his program to promote some of the most ludicrous wellness grifting that I've heard about to date,” Wyden said.Idaho Republican Sen. Mike Crapo, chairman of the committee, said during a floor speech Thursday that Oz was well qualified to run CMS.“At his hearing, Dr. Oz spoke strongly about his desire to modernize the CMS and encourage a healthy lifestyle for all Americans,” Crapo said. “His vision for treating the underlying causes of chronic disease and equipping providers with innovative technologies to serve patients will also be a much- needed sea change at CMS.”CMS scopeThe agency manages several federal health programs, including Medicare, Medicaid, the Children's Health Insurance Program and the health insurance marketplaces established by the Affordable Care Act.The agency spent more than $1.5 trillion during the last full fiscal year, about 22% of all federal spending.The more than 6,000 people who work at CMS as well as contractors “process over one billion Medicare claims annually, monitor quality of care, provide the states with matching funds for Medicaid benefits, and develop policies and procedures designed to give the best possible service to beneficiaries,” according to the latest financial report.CMS is one of many agencies housed in the Department of Health and Human Services that is subject to restructuring plans from Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr.Oz backgroundOz received his undergraduate degree from Harvard University before earning a joint M.D. and MBA from the University of Pennsylvania School of Medicine and Wharton Business School.He starred in the daytime show “Dr. Oz,” which ran from 2009 until 2022.He won the Republican primary in the 2022 Pennsylvania U.S. Senate race but was defeated during the general election by Democratic Sen. John Fetterman.When President Donald Trump announced in November he intended to nominate Oz to lead CMS, he wrote that Oz would “cut waste and fraud within our Country’s most expensive Government Agency, which is a third of our Nation’s Healthcare spend, and a quarter of our entire National Budget.”",,,,2025-04-03 17:05:57.136078

The 13 spending bills use about $2.1 billion less overall and $800 [&#8230;]","House Budget Committee Chairman Dirk Deaton, a Republican from Noel, speaks Thursday at a news conference on the Missouri state budget. Deaton was joined, from left, by state Reps. Bishop Davidson of Republic, Wendy Hausman of St. Peters and John Voss of Cape Girardeau (Rudi Keller/Missouri Independent).The Missouri House sent the state Senate a budget of almost $48 billion to fund state agency operations in the coming fiscal year, a spending plan almost certain to grow as the upper chamber adds more money for public schools and child care.
The 13 spending bills use about $2.1 billion less overall and $800 million less in general revenue than recommended by Gov. Mike Kehoe when he presented his budget plan in January. More than half of the general revenue savings are cuts to Medicaid spending based on newer estimates of enrollment in the fiscal year that begins July 1.
Some of the other reductions are due to paring back state employee pay raises, cutting spending lines where no money is actually available and shifting incomplete projects to a reappropriation bill that is not included on the bottom line.
The budget plan didn’t just cut money from Kehoe’s proposal. There were several small additions for state agencies, like $28 million for deferred maintenance on college campuses; extra pay raises for Missouri State Highway Patrol troopers and commercial vehicle inspectors at a cost of $8.4 million; and 20 new holistic defense social workers in the Office of Public Defender at a cost of $1.2 million.
There are also 105 earmarked items with a total cost of $170 million, including $142.7 million in general revenue. The projects range in size from $25,000 for a road project in St. Joseph to $19 million for a new state park in the district of House Budget Committee Chairman Dirk Deaton, a Republican from Noel.
“We’re proud to have found savings and efficiencies across state government,” Deaton said at a news conference after the House action. “We also continue to have a really historic surplus, although it is being drawn down, but still leaving $2 billion on the bottom line.”
State Rep. Del Taylor, a St. Louis Democrat, said talking about how much was cut doesn’t impress him.
“We don’t measure ourselves in dollars saved and oh, ‘I cut $100 million out of this budget and that budget,’” he said. “What we really need to be measuring ourselves on is, are we addressing the needs of our people with funding for those non-profit organizations that our state has partnered with.”
 State Rep. Del Taylor, a St. Louis Democrat, is surrounded by other members of the Democratic caucus as a Thursday news conference about the Missouri state budget (Rudi Keller/Missouri Indepenent).
The state had a balance of $3.8 billion in the general revenue fund as of Monday, down from historic high of about $5.7 billion set in 2023. The budget on its way to the Senate spends $14.4 billion in general revenue, which would require about $900 million from the accumulated surplus if revenue meets expectations.
Democrats found a lot to like in the budget, even if they were not pleased with the outcome on school funding and child care subsidies.
“House Democrats were able to make a number of changes to the budget for the betterment of their communities and the state, and it was a refreshing change from what we’ve endured in recent years,” said House Minority Leader Ashley Aune of Kansas City.
Most of the 13 bills passed with fewer than 10 votes against them. The largest number of opposition votes came on the bills funding the Department of Elementary and Secondary Education and elected officials, where $50 million for private school tuition scholarship program called  MOScholars is appropriated.
There is new anti-diversity, equity and inclusion language in the bill funding the Department of Higher Education and Workforce Development as well as long-standing language denying in-state tuition to undocumented immigrant students who live in the state. However, despite raising objections on the floor, many Democrats supported the bill as it passed 117-17.
State Rep. Betsy Fogle of Springfield, the ranking Democrat on the House Budget Committee, said Democrats had a tough choice on whether to support the higher education spending bill. The votes in favor of it were not traded for earmarks, she said.
“There’s no price act, no amount of money that would make the House Democrats sacrifice our values, our morals and our commitment to diversity, equity, inclusion in the state,” she said. “My calculation was, and always will be, how do I bring home the most investments to the most Missourians without sacrificing the values of the House Democratic Caucus?”
There is almost $500 million tied up in budget lines that are sure to get a lot of attention during Senate deliberations.
The largest is $300 million for the school foundation formula. Under the calculation establishing how much should be spent on public schools, the basic rate for state aid, called the state adequacy target, is $7,145 per pupil. The House budget plan only funds an adequacy target of $6,760 per student.
Kehoe did not include the increase in his budget and neither did the House. Senate Appropriations Committee Chairman Lincoln Hough of Springfield has said he will find the money.
One item Democrats wanted to eliminate is the $50 million appropriation for the MOScholars program. The program, expanded last year, has not attracted the donations expected and is the first time the state is making grants of tax dollars to pay tuition at private and parochial schools.
Hough has also said he intends to restore a cut to Kehoe’s budget for child care subsidies. Kehoe asked lawmakers to use $107 million of new federal funding for child care to revise how providers are paid. Instead of being paid based on attendance at the end of a month, providers would get their money at the beginning of the month based on the number of children enrolled.
The child care money isn’t in the budget, Deaton said, because it could become a cost to the general revenue fund.
“I really never even got to the point of, is this good public policy? Is this bad? Is this a better idea? Is this a better way to do it, or not?” Deaton said “We really never even got past the fiscal concerns of can we make this work year in and year out?”
The problems with the current program, plagued by late or missed payments since the launch of a new computer processing system, make the changes proposed by Kehoe essential, Fogle said.
“We sat in that budget hearing room for countless hours,” Fogle said, “listening to people cry and scream and express their frustration about our inability to do our job as a General Assembly and the department to get those dollars out the door.”

Instead, the executive director of Childhood Lead Action Project sat stiffly against the wooden benches of a dimly lit third-floor federal courtroom in Providence, listening to lawyers argue case law and legal theory as it relates to federal agencies’ distribution of congressionally approved grants and aid.
The Childhood Lead Action Project is one of the many nonprofits nationwide awarded funding under Biden-era spending packages, yet suddenly unable to access the money after President Donald Trump took office. Its $500,00 grant would have covered the cost of training for landlords and community health workers about lead safety laws and the ramifications of childhood lead poisoning. It would have also paid for one new employee — increasing the nonprofit’s small but mighty team from five to six people.
Now, Brion is stuck in limbo, unable to hire or prepare for workshops without any guarantee that the funding her organization was promised, and had started to draw down, would continue. 
“I’ve managed a lot of federal grants in my career,” Brion said in an interview outside the courtroom. “I’ve never had anything like this happen before.”
She is not alone; thousands of nonprofits nationwide have had federal funds yanked out from underneath them, leading to canceled contracts, pauses on hiring and the threat of employee layoffs. So contends a lawsuit filed by a half-dozen nonprofits, including Rhode Island’s Childhood Lead Action Project, the Woonasquatucket River Watershed Council and Eastern Rhode Island Conservation District. 










This is about childhood lead poisoning, which we know is preventable. We have a signed grant award. There’s no reason we shouldn’t be able to do this. 


– Laura Brion, executive director for the Childhood Lead Action Project


The March 14 complaint filed in U.S. District Court in Rhode Island has already amassed hundreds of pages of legal documents and exhibits from attorneys representing the nonprofits, as well as the federal agencies they are challenging. Thursday marked the first opportunity for each side to make their points in front of Rhode Island District Court Judge Mary S. McElroy.
The case echoes the many federal lawsuits challenging President Donald Trump’s executive actions and the loss of funding for research universities, state governments, arts organizations, and education, among others. The frenzy of legal action has cast new scrutiny on the powers of the executive branch.
This time, arguments hinged on a 1946 law that defined the powers and authorities of federal agencies.

Who’s got the power?
Lawyers with D.C. nonprofit Democracy Forward and Providence firm DeLuca, Weizenbaum, Barry & Ravens argued that federal agencies violated the Administrative Procedures Act by suddenly pausing grants and aid already awarded to nonprofits under Biden-era Congressional spending packages. 
“There is no reasonable basis — the government has offered none — to freeze first and ask questions later,” Jessica Morton, senior counsel with Democracy Forward, said during arguments Thursday.
Morton also sought to differentiate the complaint from a January lawsuit in D.C. filed by a group of nonprofits affected by federal funding freezes. That complaint centered on general grants and aid, not specific awards made through Biden-era spending packages. The D.C. complaint is also limited to the Office of Management and Budget and its director; the Rhode Island case spans another half dozen federal agencies and cabinet members, including the Environmental Protection Agency and departments of Agriculture and the Interior. 


Plaintiffs 
Woonasquatucket River Watershed Council
Eastern Rhode Island Conservation District
Childhood Lead Action Project
Codman Square Neighborhood Development Corporation
Green Infrastructure Center
National Council of Nonprofits 
Defendants 
Department of Agriculture and Secretary Brooke Rollins
Department of Energy and Secretary Chris Wright
Department of the Interior and Secretary Doug Bergum
Environmental Protection Agency and Administrator Lee Zeldin
Department of Housing and Urban Development and Secretary Scott Turner 
Office of Management and Budget and Director Russell Vought
National Economic Council Director Kevin Hassett


But Daniel Schwei, the U.S. Department of Justice attorney representing the Trump administration, argued that the Rhode Island lawsuit was duplicative of its D.C. predecessor, since the National Council for Nonprofits was a plaintiff in both cases. 
After McElroy appeared unpersuaded by Schwei’s allegations of redundancy, he quickly moved on to his next defense: that there was never a broad funding freeze at all. 
Schwei in court filings included testimony from the U.S. Department of Energy — one of the federal agencies named as defendants — confirming that it was no longer pausing access to federal funds for one of the case’s affected nonprofits as of late February. Two other nonprofits, the Woonasquatucket River Watershed Council and the Green Infrastructure Center, were able to access U.S. Department of Agriculture grants as of March 31, according to court documents. The grants were paused at the time the lawsuit was filed. 
“I don’t think there’s any proven basis for concluding these reviews are just indefinite pauses,” Schwei said. “The money is going out the door in some cases.”
Schwei focused much of his argument on legal doctrine around federal agency powers, citing, among other examples, a 1993 U.S. Supreme Court ruling concluding that there was no opportunity for judicial review in Congress’ decision to end its annual appropriation to the Indian Health Service.
“The fundamental question in this case is whether federal agencies, upon a new administration taking office, may pause federal funding and review it to ensure consistency with the president’s priorities,” Schwei said. “We think the answer is yes.”
McElroy, who interrupted Morton and Schwei multiple times with questions, sought to differentiate between federal spending generally allocated by Congress, and spending already awarded to specific individual recipients through competitive grants.
“At its fundamental level, this isn’t an issue of what the agencies are doing or what priorities they’re setting,” McElroy said. “The government is entitled to do that. The question is how, and what comes first: the freeze or the review?”
The three-hour hearing was heavy on legal doctrine and case law. But the consequences for nonprofits nationwide, and the communities they serve, are far more tangible.
“These laws support projects that keep children safe from lead exposure, renovate homes of low-income Americans to keep them safe from mold and carbon monoxide exposure, help family farms make the most of technology to stay in business, conserve irreplaceable natural resources, promote resilience in the face of natural disasters, support local economies, and much more,” attorneys for the nonprofits wrote in their March 17 complaint. 
Years of work building trust and relationships with the communities they serve also took a major hit when funding was cut off, Morton said.
Stuck in limbo
When, or if, federal funding to the Childhood Lead Action Project is restored, it will be tough to recruit a new hire when candidates know the money that pays for their job might be turned off at any moment, Brion said in a written statement to the courts.
Alicia Lehrer, executive director of the Woonasquatucket River Watershed Council, was reluctant to resume the organization’s $1 million tree planting and community training initiative along the 7-mile Woonaquatucket Greenway, even though federal funds were unfrozen earlier this week.
“Right now, we’re not going ahead with anything major because we don’t know what we will have long-term,” Lehrer said, speaking outside the hearing. “This is a major, major project with a lot of planning and a lot of community partners. We have people we can’t let down.”
Lehrer was reluctant to comment on the courtroom hearing she had just watched play out. But, she acknowledged a feeling of disconnection between the legal battle and what she and other nonprofit leaders are facing in their daily lives.
Brion agreed.
“This is about childhood lead poisoning, which we know is preventable,” she said. “We have a signed grant award. There’s no reason we shouldn’t be able to do this.”
While Brion’s organization was not yet contemplating layoffs, a more imminent danger for other nonprofits named in the case, it was not out of the question.
“At this point, nothing is certain,” she said.
Lawyers for the nonprofits have asked McElroy to order federal agencies to release and resume any grant funding awarded based on Inflation Reduction Act and Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act spending, not only for the plaintiffs in the case but for any grant recipients awarded money via the Biden administration spending packages.
McElroy did not indicate Thursday when she would issue an order, though she noted it would not be this week. Thursday afternoon she was scheduled to preside over a virtual hearing in another federal court case challenging the cutoff of Centers for Disease Control and Prevention grants.

You’ll also find a passionate, hard-working staff of caregivers who work too hard for too little compensation and yet strive to provide high-quality care. 
The Washington state Senate has put forward a budget that increases funding for nursing homes, recognizing the need to invest in the caregivers who dedicate themselves to caring for our residents in need. However, the state House proposal cuts funding for nursing homes by delaying rate increases until 2028, which would devastate our workforce and ability to offer high-quality long-term care.
As an SEIU 775 represented certified nursing assistant and a chief executive officer working in Washington nursing homes, we are deeply concerned about the sustainability of this essential model of long-term care in our state. Families and communities across Washington simply cannot afford to do more with less after years of crisis and inadequate state investments.
Nursing homes are a critical component of our state’s rehabilitation and long-term health care systems. While some of our residents come to us for a short-term stay following surgery or cancer treatment, many more are residents who live with us full-time and receive round-the-clock care. 
Sixty-two percent of Washington’s nursing home patients are low-income and rely on Medicaid to access care, and Medicaid reimbursement rates are set by the state Legislature. Although our sector faces a significant increase in patients needing care over the next five years, we are plagued by chronic underfunding and a workforce crisis as a result. One-time funding patches are not the solution. 
Rising costs affect everyone, but in health care systems like ours, we are unable to respond to our staff’s need for higher wages or to increased food prices for residents’ meals without the Legislature taking action. 
Administrators and nursing staff alike are cost-conscious — we’re not serving steak and lobster every night for dinner, nor are we asking for unnecessary supplies. High-quality care comes first. Without adequate staffing or equipment, it becomes tremendously difficult just to ensure we are keeping up with the basics. However, the reality is that when we show up to work, we still do our best to care for our patients, and it ends up being our own bodies and our own families that feel the cost.
Today, Medicaid funding is insufficient and outdated because it is based on how costs were measured in 2022. This means that nursing homes struggle to offer competitive wages and benefits after years of record inflation. Following the release of budget proposals from lawmakers, it’s clear that the Senate is clear-eyed about this reality and the House has yet to recognize how devastating cuts would be to our long-term care workforce and system.  We cannot delay increasing Medicaid reimbursement rates any longer than we already have. If we want to offer high-quality health care to our residents — and avoid a long-term care crisis — the Legislature must invest in caregivers.
For those who do not know someone who works in long-term care, this is not a job for the faint of heart or the dispassionate. Our colleagues are among the most dedicated and kindhearted people we know. Most of us could make more money or find better benefits at different jobs that require less demanding work. But we are still here because we love our jobs and we love our patients. 
During the pandemic, we all learned the term “essential worker”, and it includes long-term care professionals like our colleagues. Pandemic or not, our patients need us. 
Legislators have hard budget decisions before them. But they could help long-term care workers and the people they care for by adopting a funding approach that keeps up with real-world costs and does not rely on one-time investments.
They could also help by making affordable health care available to the 18,000 essential workers in the sector.
While numbers and budget items get moved around, human lives and human dignity are at stake. Difficult times call for difficult decisions, and we hope that protecting funding for those who rely on skilled nursing — whether for care or employment — can be more than a talking point in Olympia.",https://washingtonstatestandard.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/long-term-care-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-04-03 17:05:57.136078

(Screenshot from Florida Channel) The Republican controlled Florida House of Representatives has passed a measure that will make it prohibitively harder for a citizen-led constitutional amendment to get on the ballot. The vote was for 76-31.
Its passage comes just four months after two constitutional amendments that would have respectively enshrined abortion rights and legalized recreational cannabis for adults narrowly fell short of passage.
  Jenna Persons-Mulicka via Florida House
The bill (HB 1205), sponsored by Lee County Republican Jenna Persons-Mulicka, includes a number of provisions that Democrats and voting-rights advocates say could essentially kill most attempts to place citizen-led constitutional amendments on future ballots.
At the heart of the argument by advocates is the need to prevent fraud. The Office of Election Crimes and Security published a report in January asserting that more than 100 representatives of the group attempting to pass the abortion-rights last year committed crimes related to gathering petitions.
And last week the Office of Election Crimes and Security informed Smart & Safe Florida, the group working to get a constitutional amendment regarding the adult use of cannabis on the 2026 ballot, that the Division of Elections was fining them $121,850 for allegedly submitting petitions more than 30 days after voters signed them — a violation of existing law.
“We have seen widespread and rampant fraud in this state and in this process,” said Persons-Mulicka. “We have evidence that we cannot take a blind eye to. We must take further action to put integrity back into the initiative process.”
The changes
Among the most contentious provisions is a requirement that the state Office of Elections Crimes and Security investigate if more than 10% of submitted petitions during any reporting period are deemed invalid.
The requirement amounts to a 90% validity rate, which Democrats say is impossible to overcome.
Orlando Democratic Rep. Anna Eskamani offered an amendment to reduce the percentage of submitted petitions deemed invalid to trigger an investigation to a 60% validity rate. It was struck down.
Other provisions include:

Requiring the petition sponsor to post a $1 million bond payable to the Division of Elections once the sponsor has obtained a letter from the department confirming that 25% of the requisite number of signatures has been obtained.
If a person who is collecting or handling initiatives petitions is found to not be a U.S. citizen or has been convicted of a felony without having his right to vote restored, the petition sponsor is liable for a $50,000 fine for each person.
The bill revises the deadline by which petitions must be delivered by the sponsor to a supervisor of elections from 30 days to 10 days and increases the fines from a $50 flat fee for each late petition form to $50 for each day late for a total fine of up to $2,500 per late petition form. If the sponsor or petition circulator acted “willfully,” the bill increases the penalty from $250 for each petition form to $2,500.
The bill requires all petition circulators — volunteers as well as paid staffers — to be residents of Florida. It says that before a paid petition circulator is registered, he or she must submit to a criminal background check to be paid for by the applicant or petition sponsor.
Removes  the coordinator of the Office of Economic and Demographic Research from the Financial Impact Estimating Conference, which prepares financial impact statements to accompany any proposed constitutional amendment. (The sitting  coordinator of the office, Florida chief economist Amy Baker, is the only member of the Financial Impact Estimating Conference not directly appointed by a Republican politician).

To get a proposed amendment by initiative on the general election ballot, currently a petition must be signed by 891,589 voters and the signatures must come from at least half of Florida’s 28 congressional districts. To pass, it must win 60% support from the voters.
Voters silenced?
During debate on the House floor, Broward County Democratic Rep. Robin Bartleman argued it would be unfair to make an onerous process even harder to accomplish.

“You are shutting out our fellow Floridians,” she said. “If we really are about the free state of Florida — which is we always like to say we are — then it’s our duty that the power remains in the hands of the people. Every hurdle that you are putting up here today takes it out of their hands. Our citizen-led constitutional amendment provision is already the strictest in the country.”
Before the floor debate, voting rights groups held a news conference in the Fourth Floor rotunda of the Capitol, where they blasted the bill as “undemocratic.”
“They are trying to silence us,” said Amy Keith with Common Cause Florida. “They are trying to make it impossible for everyday Floridians to put citizen-led amendments on the ballot. They don’t want us to be able to directly pass policies that we know our communities need. They think that they have the right to silence us but we are here to say, ‘No.’”
“Why are the legislators afraid of the average citizen talking to their neighbor?” said Cecile Scoon, co-president of the League of Women Voters of Florida.
 “Who are the legislators listening to? It appears when you look at these bills to limit citizen’s constitutional amendment process, they’re listening to big companies, they’re making it so that only big money can use the citizen process, which is supposed to be for the everyday person.”

(Getty Images) Veterinary experts nationwide have a variety of hypotheses for new and puzzling test results from cow milk being analyzed for avian influenza — including in New Mexico.
March marked one year since officials first reported Highly Pathogenic Avian Influenza — H5N1 — among dairy cattle. Since then, bird flu has infected 996 herds across the country, including 19 cases in the last month in California and Idaho.
New Mexico reported nine dairy herds in Curry County tested positive last April, and began milk testing its cattle in February following the rollout of a federal program.
The most recent results from milk-testing programs revealed that while more than 95% of the 93 cow herds in the state tested negative, a small set of inconsistent positives — all from three Curry County herds infected last year — remain, according to New Mexico State Veterinarian Samantha Holeck.
Enter the mystery: The cows themselves do not test positive, nor do they demonstrate the symptoms documented in the earlier avian flu outbreak, she said, such as huge drops in milk production.
“It’s been a real challenge to try to understand how it continues to circulate in some of these herds,” Holeck said.
New Mexico is partnering up with veterinarians in the U.S. Department of Agriculture to research the viral fragments found in the milk and sent samples to the federal National Veterinary Services Laboratories in Ames, Iowa.
“I know we’re a year into this situation now,” Holeck said, “but it seems like there’s still just so much to try to understand.”
New Mexico isn’t alone in experiencing the viral fragments, said Michael Payne, a food animal veterinarian at University of California, Davis, who noted there have been reports of similar persistent positives in quarantined herds there.
“I wouldn’t diminish the importance of it being small,” Payne said. “Yes, we’re talking about low levels of virus and yes, we’re talking about cows not getting sick, but it’s important that we’re not exactly sure where it’s coming from, and that in and of itself merits examination.”
He said more than $2 million dollars of research is being conducted in California on avian flu transmission across a dozen projects; including examining if it’s transmitted by flies; blowing in from dust storms; or carried by birds outside of waterfowl.
“It will be critical that we figure out how the disease is moving and how it’s changing,” Payne said.
‘Science is still very much in its infancy’
While scientists need to perform more research, Payne posited some possibilities for the detection of viral fragments: they could signify a different and less potent version of the virus; cooler weather might allow more viral fragments to survive in the bulk tanks, compared to the triple-digit temperatures in the fall; cows may have developed “herd immunity” against the virus.
“It could be that much smaller numbers of cattle are being exposed and are becoming infected, which has resulted in a much, much lower level of virus that’s being detected inside the bulk tanks,” Payne said. “It’s an area of active research.”
Veterinarian Andrew Bowman, a molecular epidemiologist at Ohio State University, said laboratory tests’ sensitivity could also be a factor: They may be picking up positives from environmental contamination in the tanks or on the farms.
“It doesn’t take much; we’re talking a few copies of the viral genome to be present in a sample to send it positive,” Bowman said. “We can pick up a positive that’s likely not a viable virus.”
Since the development of HPAI in cows is so new, as is the method of transmission — where the virus replicates in the mammary glands that produce milk — he said the basic questions of the interactions between the virus, the host and the environment still need answers.
“Science is still very much in the infancy of what we know about avian influenza in cattle,” Bowman said.
Offering reassurances
While scientists say it’s important to unravel the mystery of the viral fragments to better understand how the virus might change or spread in dairy cows, they also emphasize that risk to the public from avian influenza remains low.
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reports transmission of avian flu can occur from contact with milk from infected cows; eating, drinking or inhaling droplets contaminated with live virus; touching the live or dead bodies of infected animals. Thus far, the CDC has no documented human-to-human transmission. As of April 1, 70 people had contracted H5N1, mostly California farmworkers.
Most milk sold in the U.S. is heated to a temperature to kill bacteria and viruses, called pasteurization. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration tested milk products in 17 states and, finding no live viruses, reported that “pasteurization is effective at inactivating H5N1, and that the commercial, pasteurized milk supply is safe.”
Federal officials, however, warn that unpasteurized milk, also called raw milk, is unsafe to drink. Research from the National Institutes of Health in June using infected raw milk from New Mexico found that the H5N1 virus had survived for at least five weeks in refrigerated conditions. Further, mice that consumed the raw milk showed signs of illness, which  researchers suggest indicates drinking raw milk can transmit the virus to other organisms.
Holeck emphasized that New Mexico milk is safe.
“For dairies, it’s standard routine if they have sick cows for any reason, not just [avian flu], that milk is always diverted out from the milk supply, it doesn’t enter commerce,” she said.

(Legislative stream screengrab)The Nevada Department of Corrections is racking up $60 million in overtime a year because of the need to shift correction officers from one post to another to address staffing shortages, resulting in a $50 million dollar budgeting shortfall that took lawmakers by surprise during a hearing Thursday of the Interim Finance Committee. 
NDOC Director James Dzurenda told lawmakers he was instructed by the Governor’s Finance Office last year that the department’s personnel shortage could not be addressed until a staffing study initiated in 2024 is completed in June. 
Dzurenda testified the department is “usually about $60 million short on day one” of a biennium because of overtime demands. He predicted the study will “be devastating” and reveal a biennial shortfall of “over $100 million.” 
“So you’re saying that your agency told the governor’s office… ‘hey, we’re going to run into huge deficits. We’re going to overspend like nobody’s business in overtime,’ and they were aware of this, and they just didn’t bring it to our attention until March?” an incredulous Sen. Rochelle Nguyen asked Dzurenda. 
“I don’t know when they brought it to your attention, but these discussions have been happening since I got here in ‘23,” Dzurenda responded. “We knew we were going to be short, and I’m telling you, we’re going to be short next time, too.”
Lombardo did not respond to a request for comment. The governor, when asked about economic concerns in recent months, has repeatedly referred to “triaging” the state through any fiscal storm. 
Triaging in the state prison department amounts to reducing visitation and shifting in-person educational programming to correspondence courses. 
The overtime problem, Dzurenda said, “is complicated” and involves a number of variables, such as delays in obtaining a staffing study to substantiate the need for additional positions; unbudgeted costs such as transporting prisoners; staffing NDOC’s training academy; and the cost of overtime provisions included in a collective bargaining agreement negotiated in 2023 for correction officers. 
Democratic Senate Majority Leader Nicole Cannizzaro told Dzurenda if he was aware of a “regular, ongoing use of overtime monies,” a request should have been made for “a reserve of X amount of dollars that we believe we are going to have to pay overtime.” 
Instead, she argued Republican Gov. Joe Lombardo’s administration “turned a blind eye to it,” leaving lawmakers “halfway through a legislative session, to figure out how to fill that hole.”
One corrections officer has racked up 1,600 hours of overtime since the fiscal year began, “which puts you on track to work 80-hour weeks,” Nguyen said, adding she was “incredibly disappointed” and branded the episode “a failure on so many levels.”  
NDOC’s current solution, she added, cuts the education programs that “from what we’ve heard from you, Director, over and over and over again, actually make those prisons safer for your correction officers and safer for the people that are incarcerated in there. Is that my understanding?”
“Yes,” Dzurenda replied. 
Democratic Sen. Danielle Monroe Moreno, a former corrections officer, voiced a “need to apologize” to Dzurenda, adding she didn’t know if the governor or the Legislature had put him in a situation that “is not winnable.”
“We have a responsibility to make sure that you get what you need for your staff to be safe and the inmates in our charge to be safe,” she said, and directed NDOC to seek additional funding during the legislative interim. 
In other IFC developments, Monroe Moreno warned agencies with projects funded by American Rescue Plan funds, which will revert to the federal government if not spent by the end of next year, that because of President Donald Trump’s tariffs, increasing costs of construction and goods could jeopardize their timely completion.",https://nevadacurrent.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Image-4-3-25-at-12.53-PM-1024x775.jpeg,,,2025-04-03 16:04:16.203427

(Makenzie Huber/South Dakota Searchlight)South Dakota public university tuition will increase after remaining flat for the last three years.
The Board of Regents, which oversees the university system, approved a system-wide average 2.9% undergraduate tuition increase during its Thursday meeting at Northern State University in Aberdeen. Tuition will rise by roughly that amount at five of the state’s universities, while South Dakota Mines in Rapid City will increase its tuition by 4.5% “to align the institution” with peer universities, the Regents said in a news release, and to help support the university’s “special focus” on engineering, science and technology.
Regents director: Dearth of need-based aid dings South Dakota’s college affordability

The board also approved a $1 per credit hour increase in the mandatory general activity fee, which supports student activities and campus amenities, along with increases to housing and meal plan rates and other specialized or campus-specific fee increases. 
The total annual undergraduate cost for South Dakota students will increase by $520.15 next year to an average of $18,939.92, according to the board.
Inflation and legislative decisions in a tight budget year contributed to the increase, and tough budget years will continue, said Board of Regents Executive Director Nathan Lukkes. 
“We certainly don’t want to get into a place where we’re going too cheap, if you will,” Lukkes said, “and start to sacrifice quality for our students.”
‘Conservative’ increase helps cover ‘minimum’ cost increases
Competition with regional institutions largely drove tuition freezes approved by the Regents and funded by the Legislature in the last three years. South Dakota had the lowest tuition and fees for an undergraduate resident and non-resident degree compared to surrounding states in the last two school years.
Regents last approved a tuition increase of 1.1% in fiscal year 2021.


While the Legislature provided funding for tuition freezes prior to this year, that funding did not support a fee freeze, which the system chose to do anyway. The Legislature’s annual mandated increases in employee salaries did not come with extra funding either, said Heather Forney, vice president of finance and administration for the system. Universities absorbed the costs.
“In an era where our neighboring states are increasing tuition by double digits, we’ve really held the line,” Forney said.
The increases will help address “astronomical” inflation and insurance costs universities ate during the tuition freeze era, Forney added. For example, some building insurance costs rose 450% in the last five years.
The system couldn’t avoid increasing fees and tuition forever, said board member Pam Roberts. She called the proposal a “conservative” increase.
Board President Tim Rave agreed.
“I think the 2.9% really reflects, maybe in some aspects, the minimum,” Rave said. “It’s really not covering all the costs that the universities are exposed to.”
Softened legislative cuts remain an ‘ongoing concern’
The Legislature’s recent $2 million cut to the regental budget will lead to “tough financial decisions” for universities, according to a South Dakota Board of Regents press release Thursday.
“After many years of strong legislative support, these reductions may threaten key programs, support services, and physical infrastructure,” the release said, “potentially impacting the state’s long-term workforce development and economic growth.”
Lawmakers also upheld a price increase for South Dakota high school students taking dual-credit college classes, but defeated a proposed funding reduction for the state’s medical residency program. Legislators used one-time funding to avoid a proposed $9.1 million building maintenance and repair cut. That will “kick the can down the road,” Lukkes told board members.
“That certainly remains an ongoing concern,” Lukkes said, “in terms of how we make sure that we have access to the resources necessary to maintain our facilities and provide a top quality experience to our students without simply passing the cost along to students.”

This session, lawmakers are taking up bills that could impact the high-tech industry in Montana for years to come, from ones that ease oversight and taxes for data centers to another that would help legislators grasp complex new technology on the landscape.
Data centers are the digital infrastructure backbone for many advancements, including blockchain technology, but use significant amounts of energy.
House Bill 877, brought by Rep. John Fitzpatrick, R-Anaconda, is called the Montana Data Center Development Act, and seeks to block the Public Service Commission from preventing a utility from serving large customers in a way the agency itself opposes. 
“It strips away PSC oversight. It’s a deregulation bill,” said PSC President Brad Molnar, in the House Energy, Technology and Government Relations Committee. “Call it what you want to, it’s a deregulation bill.”
Proponents included NorthWestern Energy, which argued it would be able to produce enough electricity to meet new demands.
Senate Bill 330, brought by Sen. Gayle Lammers, R-Hardin, seeks to build legislative capacity for understanding blockchain and digital innovation as well as seeks inroads with companies engaged in blockchain and digital finance. It was sent to Gov. Greg Gianforte’s desk on an 81-18 margin on Monday afternoon.
“It really is going to be a big educational bill, and that’s what’s neat about it,” Lammers said in an interview with the Daily Montanan. “And it kind of solves the problem that everybody has with it. They say, ‘Oh, I just don’t understand, and I don’t know,’ and that’s why I brought this bill.”
Two other bills seeing movement also touch on the business, technology and power. 
House Bill 424, brought by Rep. Katie Zolnikov, R-Billings, seeks to revise taxes for Class 17 properties, which include data centers. 
Meanwhile, Sen. Daniel Zolnikov, R-Billings, has brought Senate Bill 265, which seeks to revise cryptocurrency laws in the state. It would affect so-called “network tokens” and would formally regulate businesses using blockchain technology. Network tokens are used in payments as an alternative to a payment card number.
 The energy question

Underneath all the technology bills is an underlying question as to whether Montana has the energy capacity to serve both its residential and industrial customers.
Cold is a major worry — there’s a lot of demand for energy when winter hits, and “brownouts,” when there’s a reduction of power in a specific area, are a major concern for some in the Legislature.
NorthWestern customers recently had to pay an extra $39 million following a cold snap because the utility had to buy power on the market.
“We need to make sure that the power that’s going to satisfy these larger loads doesn’t become a critical and potentially problematic factor when we’re at 20 below zero, and we’ve already experienced that,” Sen. Chris Pope, D-Bozeman, told the Daily Montanan.
In December 2024, NorthWestern Energy announced an expectation to serve “up to” 450 MW of power to data centers, according to Jo Dee Black, a spokesperson for the company, in an email to the Daily Montanan. Black added the utility owns 1,065 MW of production capacity, but it “would be wrong to state that all that generation, or all generation from an owned-generation resource, would serve a single class of customers.”
NorthWestern is also adding to its capacity, both at the coal-fired plant in Colstrip, and its new methane-fired plant in Laurel. But Molnar said data center businesses will put permanent pressure on energy providers.
“Data centers, they don’t scale up or down,” Molnar said. “They are a constant run of their computers storing and generating data. They do not ramp up and down based on how much electricity is available.”
At one point, NorthWestern was producing about 1,600 MW of electricity. Peak demand in 2023, according to the utility, was about 2,000 MW.
During the hearing for Fitzpatrick’s bill, Alan Olson, who was lobbying for NorthWestern, was asked if the utility could provide enough base load energy to meet customer demands.
“Today, we are short,” Olson said to the committee.
This session has seen a push to bring nuclear power to Montana, cited by tech companies as a way to ramp up domestic power production. 
Fitzpatrick’s bill brought the need for more production — and whether or not the utility can serve all of its customers — to the forefront. NorthWestern believes it will have enough generation capacity to follow through on the commitments it makes to businesses drawing large amounts of power, such as data centers.
“Recently, the PSC seems to have developed a novel interpretation of the law, which suggests that they get to decide whether or not Northwestern can serve a new industrial load,” Fitzpatrick said on Monday in House Energy. “This bill simply says no, it’s not within the purview of the PSC authority to tell NorthWestern who it cannot serve as long as the proposed new customers can demonstrate that the services received does not harm existing customers.”
The bill says the PSC’s “role does not extend to prohibiting large electric customers from obtaining service from certain public utilities.” Fitzpatrick is a former NorthWestern lobbyist. 
There’s been frustration from some Democrats with NorthWestern as well.
“Northwestern Energy says, ‘Oh, we can absolutely provide this energy,’” Minority Leader Katie Sullivan said in an interview with the Daily Montanan. “And at the same time, they come to us and say, ‘We have an energy crisis, and we can’t supply energy to homes anymore.’”
Currency mining is one the purposes of data centers, an industry some legislators want to grow in Montana.
Currency mining, or proofing, is an energy-intensive process that essentially involves a computer solving complex math problems. The more computers and larger the system, the faster it can process those problems, and miners can receive cryptocurrency as a reward for doing so.
In 2022, the U.S. Energy Information Administration reported cryptocurrency mining “probably represents from 0.6% to 2.3% of U.S. electricity consumption.”
To put it in perspective, one estimate out of Columbia University’s Climate School had cryptocurrency worldwide uses as much electricity as the country of Argentina. 
More computers means more energy consumption. This was at the heart of disputes in Missoula County several years ago, which eventually led the county to develop zoning regulations for cryptocurrency.
Essentially, the county forced mining companies to source clean power for their operations. A bill in 2023 — SB 178, brought by Sen. Zolnikov — took away a municipality’s ability to pass certain laws regarding cryptocurrency mining. 
 Task Force Blockchain

While energy usage is an important discussion point on data centers and new technology, Montana’s economy is too.
As Bozeman continues to develop as a tech hub and Montana remains an attractive place to live, legislators say some foresight will likely be needed to guide future laws.
Lammers’ bill, SB 330, will do just that.
A new task force created by his bill will be made up of a handful of legislators as well appointees of the governor, Senate and House leadership. The Attorney General’s office and State Auditor will also have representatives on the task force.
Their goal will be to provide recommendations that will shape future laws, as well as to attract businesses to the state. The businesses aim to bring include energy-intensive data centers, a focus this session, but a major debate across the state for about a decade.
Lammers’ bill specifically deals with blockchain technology. The blockchain is a type of ledger that records information transferred between entities.
Cryptocurrency — a decentralized, digital currency — has been most commonly associated with blockchain, but it’s not the only application. Advocates, including Lammers, point to potential in medical records, uses in agriculture, and tracking supply chains. 
Proponents of the technology, including IBM, say it’s more secure  — it’s stored on a network rather than on one server — and reduces the risk of fraud as blockchain records cannot be altered. Medical records, for example, are either stored electronically or as physical copies. The idea is technology like blockchain can make accessing records easier and quicker. Additionally, blockchain technology does not require a third-party to approve a transaction, keeping things between two entities.
The bill was heard in the House Energy, Technology and Federal Relations Committee on March 19 and had several proponents, including the Montana Bankers Association and the Satoshi Action Fund, a nonprofit dedicated to advocating for Bitcoin, a type of cryptocurrency. 
“We believe that Bitcoin and Bitcoin mining have the potential to positively impact our environment, our grid, our economy, and society as a whole,” the Satoshi Action Fund states on its website.
However, a 2023 United Nations study pointed to serious environmental concerns with Bitcoin, which it said is highly dependent on fossil fuels.
 Reputation problems

Not all of the pushback against blockchain technology and the data centers needed to run them involve energy. 
A controversy in Butte over CryptoWatt, a cryptomining company, involved a majority owner who was indicted in a $722 million Ponzi scheme.
Some legislators are wondering if this new technology has staying power or is the right industry for Montana to embrace.
“I think a lot of the problems with the reputation of cryptocurrency now was it was oversold and became a pretty easy Ponzi scheme to get into and scam, you know, pump and dump,” Rep. Kelly Kortum, D-Bozeman, said in an interview with the Daily Montanan. “There are legitimate uses of cryptocurrency and Bitcoin, but it’s been so abused by so many bad actors that they’ve lost a lot of credibility on their practical, real world uses.”
Legislators also discussed the makeup of the task force, a minor controversy. There’s also the question of what type of businesses Montana wants, an idea that doesn’t exactly hold to partisan lines.
For example, Senate President Matt Reiger, R-Kalispell, said he likes small businesses in Montana and “the rural feel.”
“You can make great money just being in the trades,” Reiger said during a media presser. “You don’t need a tech job. You probably make more being a plumber, honestly.”
 New regulations

Senate Bill 265, brought by Sen. Zolnikov and co-sponsored by Rep. Zolnikov, a married couple, has yet to hit the House floor, but had a hearing in the House Energy, Technology and Government Relations Committee the same day Lammers’ SB 330 was heard there.
The legislation is regulatory in nature, Sen. Zolnikov said during the hearing.
“We’re trying to attract these very on-the-leading-edge technology companies to our state and give them a framework in which they can live and play within without worrying about being thrown out or breaking a law they didn’t know they’re breaking,” Zolnikov said.
The legislation would also make it law that a governing authority can’t disallow a business from taking digital assets or currency as a form of payment. It also formally allows the operation of businesses either using or developing software for blockchain operations.
There’s also a securities exemption, which Zolnikov said would clear up ambiguities in the law. The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission requires, “Every offer and sale of securities must either be registered under the Securities Act of 1933” or have an exemption.
“This bill, with the help of the auditor’s office and other individuals, creates a clear pathway for entities who want to be in America, who are legitimate.”
To be sure these companies don’t get bogged down with federal U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission requirements, the bill also offers an exemption, which Sen. Zolnikov said would clear up ambiguities about whether they need to register.
House Bill 424, brought by Rep. Zolnikov, seeks to make the business climate more friendly and stable for businesses utilizing data centers. The bill does this by creating incentives for on-site energy production at data centers and extending the timeframe in which those businesses can be built. 
Some regulations surrounding the data centers sunset in 2027, she said during a floor debate on March 24.
That bill included an amendment from Rep. Fitzpatrick dealing with the price of power and taxation. Data centers would only be able to sell excess power for cost of production, in an effort to prevent price gouging during electrical emergencies. The amendment also revises the tax rate on power production, putting it in class 13 — the power plant class — after a period of 10 years.
The property tax rate for data centers is 0.9%, while power plants pay a 6% property tax rate. Power generation facilities at data centers would slowly have their rate increased over time, treating it as an introductory rate. Lastly, the amendment would also not exempt data centers from paying into tax increment financing districts.
“Class 17 property regarding data centers currently exist in state law,” Rep. Zolnikov said during a floor session on March 24. “What we’re doing in this bill is we’re expanding this class to include power generation behind the meter, and this is what’s key to supporting grid resiliency and benefiting Montana in times of electrical emergencies.”



 Blockchain Task Force

Some representatives took issue with who would be on the task force created by SB 330.
The amendments made some people feel more at ease with the legislation, Lammers said. The amendments put six legislators on the task force, as well as the state auditor and attorney general or their designees. 
The governor also gets to pick five people to put on the task force and those individuals who would need to have experience with blockchain, cryptocurrency, financial technology or digital innovation technology.
The majority leaders in both the House and Senate also get to pick four other members each who do not have to be in the legislature. Minority leaders in both chambers get to pick one representative each.
“I’m worried that some of the members selected could not necessarily be experts, but be marketing experts,” Kortum said. “And that’s something we’re seeing nationwide.”",https://dailymontanan.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/GettyImages-1353360317-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-04-03 16:04:16.203427

(Photo by Alexander Castro/Rhode Island Current)Legislation moving through the Rhode Island House and Senate could alleviate one pain point for parents: Filling a prescription for ADHD medications amid ongoing shortages.
On Tuesday, the Rhode Island House Committee on Health and Human Services OK’d an amended version of H5866, a bill led by Portsmouth Democratic Rep. Michelle McGaw that would improve patients’ access to prescription stimulants by allowing pharmacies to fill and dispense a 60-day supply rather than in 30-day increments as is currently allowed. The drugs are mainly used to treat ADHD and ADD, hyperactivity and attention deficit disorders, and since 2022 have consistently faced shortages nationwide.
The bill’s Senate duplicate — introduced by Sen. Alana DiMario, a Narragansett Democrat — was also heard in committee on Tuesday. It was held for further study, which is standard practice at a bill’s initial hearing, but at least one of DiMario’s colleagues on the Senate Committee on Health was supportive.
“As someone who has to do this, yes, it’s very angst provoking for the provider and for the patient,” said Sen. Pam Lauria, a Barringon Democrat and primary care nurse practitioner. 
DiMario’s bill would permit a more plentiful prescription by allowing pharmacies to issue a 90-day supply in a single filling. The original version of McGaw’s bill also endorsed a 90-day supply before being amended on March 28 ahead of its second committee hearing. The house’s legal counsel said at Tuesday’s hearing that there had been comments from physicians which spurred the change but did not provide details. 
DiMario wrote via text message Thursday that for now, her Senate bill will retain the 90-day stipulation.
“We just had the hearing so the [Committee] Chair will review all the testimony and decide how to proceed,” DiMario wrote, “but to my knowledge there isn’t a compelling reason to shorten the timeline to 60 days given those prescriptions can be written 90 days at a time in three separate prescriptions already.”
DiMario and McGaw’s bills are written to permit larger prescriptions for “non-opioid, non-narcotic Schedule II substances.” Schedule II drugs can be very habit-forming, but have at least some specific clinical applications, including prescription stimulants like mixed amphetamine salts (Adderall), Ritalin and Vyvanse, which are used to treat ADHD and ADD.
Since 2007, the Drug Enforcement Administration has allowed doctors to write prescriptions for 90 days’ worth of Schedule II medications. But these 90-day prescriptions cannot be picked up all at once, and they can’t be sent to a pharmacy at the same time. A physician must write three separate prescriptions, three months in a row. The patient will then see their doctor for another round of prescriptions, and the cycle begins anew. Multiple prescriptions may also be written for different strengths, to divvy up a larger dose and get around shortages.

No-brainer or bad idea? 
DiMario also sponsored a successful bill signed into law by Gov. Dan McKee last year that prepares state health officials to adopt a 2023 federal standard that allows for electronic transfers of ADHD prescriptions — another common obstacle for patients and doctors alike, as federal prescription regulations plus continued shortages frequently complicate accessibility for patients.
Dr. Gregory Fox, a pediatrician speaking on behalf of the Rhode Island chapter of the American Academy of Pediatrics, told senators Tuesday the bill was a “no-brainer” from a physician’s perspective as well. 
“I sat down with my two nurses today and they told me, when they arrived this morning, there were 20 refills for ADD prescriptions waiting for them, and then many, many, many come on through the day,” Fox said, estimating that his office nurses spend “at least three or four hours of administrative time per day on ADHD prescriptions,” which DiMario’s bill would slash by a third. 
Supportive testimonies for the legislation for DiMario’s bill and McGaw’s original draft came from the Rhode Island Pharmacists Association as well.
Dr. Howard Schulman, an internist and primary care doctor based in East Providence who said he often tried to bring a “from the trenches” perspective on health care to lawmakers in his public testimonies, was the lone person to submit a letter Tuesday against the bill.
In a phone call Wednesday, Schulman noted he was more comfortable with the 60-day rule over the 90-day proposal. He emphasized that he understands the motivation for the legislation, and has empathy for the lawmakers who expressed frustration at having to refill their kids’ medicine over and over.  
“This bill, if we pass it, is going to make my life better,” said Rep. Jennifer Boylan, a Barrington Democrat, at the initial March 18 hearing of McGaw’s bill. “I’m one of the parents that is going to the pharmacy three times a month. They cannot synchronize the prescriptions. I’m calling the doctor for three different prescriptions every single month. It’s ridiculous.”
But Schulman was not convinced it was wise to increase a patient’s supply of drugs that can become more habit-forming with higher doses, especially when the drugs are often shared among young people.
“​​I’m always trying to minimize the amount,” said Schulman of the stimulant prescriptions he’s been writing for 15 years in his practice. “There’s a fair number of people who are on it, [but] I’m not giving it out like candy.” 
Schulman prescribes at most 60 milligrams once a day — half the amount some patients say they’re taking when they arrive at his office from other prescribers. Schulman also asks his patients to read “Generation Adderall,” a 2016 New York Times article that detailed one woman’s account of dependence and eventual cessation from the popular amphetamine.
Asked if filling even larger prescriptions for the drugs could exacerbate existing shortages, Schulman chuckled but didn’t speculate. He said his concern was with lawmakers who aren’t doctors “regulating something that could affect people getting addicted to it.” 
Schulman said he hoped the Rhode Island Department of Health would have something to say about the bill. But the state health department “has no position on this bill,” Joseph Wendelken, an agency spokesperson, wrote via email Wednesday.
The House bill will now go to a floor vote, likely the week of April 21, said House spokesperson Larry Berman in an email Thursday.

(Photo via Getty Images)Starting on June 20, a new state law may help workers in New Mexico who are hurt on the job have an easier time finding a lawyer to handle their workers’ compensation claims.
State law previously capped the fees an attorney could collect for representing a worker making an accidental injury claim at $22,500.
New Mexico Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham on March 21 signed into law House Bill 66, which raised the cap on attorney’s fees in workers’ compensation cases to $30,000, and will raise it again to $32,000 in 2027, and then $34,000 in 2029.
Ben Sherman, a workers’ compensation attorney and an expert witness on HB66, told the House Labor, Veterans and Military Affairs Committee on Jan. 28 that many workers don’t have attorneys and litigate their cases on their own.
Sherman said there is a “huge shortage” of lawyers practicing workers’ compensation in New Mexico, especially in rural areas.
“It can be almost impossible — if you’re not in Albuquerque or Santa Fe — to find an attorney to represent you if you’re injured on the job,” he said.
The new law also allows insurance companies to advance a greater share of the injured worker’s legal costs for discovery, which is the process of gathering evidence in a case and could include testimony from the doctor who treated the injured worker.
Previously, the law capped this advance at $3,000. Workers only get the money back if they win, Sherman said.
HB66 increased the discovery cost advances to $3,500 and will raise it again to $4,000 in 2027, and then $4,500 in 2029.
Workers’ Compensation Administration rules allow doctors and other health care providers to charge up to $400 for the first hour of being deposed; up to $360 per hour for the second and subsequent hours; up to $200 per hour for the first hour of preparing to be deposed and up to $120 per hour for the second hour of preparation and subsequent hours.
Sherman told the committee there is a shortage of doctors in New Mexico who want to treat injured workers in part because they “are not paid commensurate with doctors who do private insurance or are paid in other ways to treat workers.”
He said some pending rules from the WCA would increase how much doctors can charge for their time preparing for and participating in depositions.
Stephanie Welch, workers’ rights director with the New Mexico Center on Law and Poverty, told the committee that her organization supported the bill because workers’ compensation offers a vital safety net that protects workers from the economic hardships created by medical bills and lost wages after they experience a workplace injury.
Welch said many workers who suffer workplace injuries, and who paid into the workers’ compensation system, never obtain the benefits in part because of the lack of incentive for private attorneys to take their cases.
“This bill helps level the playing field between workers and employers, and offsets some of the advantage that employers often have because they have more financial resources,” Welch said. “This bill is good for New Mexico’s workers and ensures a more equitable workers compensation system.”
Lawmakers in 2023 asked the state Workers’ Compensation Administration to create a task force to study attorney’s fee caps.
Rep. Pamelya Herndon (D-Albuquerque) sponsored HB66 and the 2023 memorial that created the task force. Source NM left a voicemail for Herndon on Thursday seeking comment on the bill’s enactment but had not heard back as of publication time.
Sherman, a member of the New Mexico Trial Lawyers Association and of the task force, told the committee that lawmakers last set the attorney fee cap at $22,500 in 2013. He said if the cap had followed inflation, it would be $32,750 today.
The new law also directs the Advisory Council on Workers’ Compensation and Occupational Disease Disablement to review the caps and make recommendations to the Legislature in 2029.

In order to ensure [&#8230;]","Planned Parenthood clinic in Marquette, the only abortion care clinic in the U.P., on Dec. 9, 2021 | Allison R. DonahuePlanned Parenthood of Michigan announced Wednesday that it will be closing its health centers in Jackson, Petoskey and Marquette at the end of the month and consolidating the two health centers in Ann Arbor into one location after the Trump administration cut millions of dollars in federal funding for family planning.
In order to ensure long-term sustainability amid funding cuts and expected future restrictions on reproductive health care enacted by President Donald Trump’s administration, Planned Parenthood of Michigan, or PPMI said in a news release that it is eliminating some clinics and cutting its staffing by 10 percent.
“Our decision to restructure reflects months of strategic planning and careful financial analysis,” Paula Thornton Greear, President and CEO of PPMI said in a news release. “These necessary changes strengthen PPMI’s ability to adapt quickly in a challenging political landscape. While implementing difficult decisions is never easy, they are essential to protect our long-term capacity to fulfill our mission and serve Michigan communities for generations to come.” 
Trump himself for years has articulated his interest in defunding Planned Parenthood for providing abortion care, and the Department of Health and Human Services, or HHS announced this week that it is placing a freeze on millions of dollars to a federal program dedicated to family planning for low-income patients known as Title X.
Nine Planned Parenthood state affiliates that receive federal money from the 55-year-old Title X family planning program got notices Monday, informing them that their funding is being “temporarily withheld.” The notice pointed to “possible violations” of federal civil rights law and President Donald Trump’s executive orders — including prohibitions on promotion of diversity, equity and inclusion and “taxpayer subsidization of open borders.”
Whitmer orders state departments to review Trump executive orders on DEI, transgender policies

The cut comes as a devastating blow to health care providers like PPMI, Thornton Greear said in the news release. And though PPMI plans on expanding hours for its Virtual Health Center for telehealth services like birth control, medicated abortions and gender affirming health care, the current administration’s attitude towards reproductive health care has PPMI preparing for further challenges.
“And in the coming weeks and months, additional attacks against sexual and reproductive health care providers are expected, including restricting access to medication abortion, restricting Medicaid coverage of Planned Parenthood health services, further restrictions on Title X funding, or even ending the program altogether, as the administration has already done to so many other lifesaving Federal funding streams and agencies,” Thornton Greear said.
With the Marquette and Petoskey locations set to be permanently closed by the end of April, Michigan’s Upper Peninsula and much of Northern Michigan will be more than 100 miles from a Planned Parenthood, with the next closest Planned Parenthood clinic to Marquette nearly five hours away, in Traverse City.
The closing of the Marquette clinic is a sad affair, the Marquette County Democratic Party said in a news release Thursday, adding that the group stands ready to advocate for those in the Upper Peninsula to continue to receive the services they had been accessing through the Planned Parenthood clinic.
“We are outraged by the partisan Republican federal funding freeze that caused the loss of the local clinic. Planned Parenthood has long put into practice values that Democrats hold dear, such as personal autonomy, women’s rights, LGBTQIA+ rights, and affordable access to health care services,” the party said in a news release.

(File photo by Pennsylvania Capital-Star)Untraceable firearms are a growing problem in Rhode Island even as overall crimes are trending downward, according to a newly published report from state Attorney General Peter Neronha.
The latest Gun Crimes Report released Thursday notes that state prosecutors charged and disposed of 751 cases involving illegal firearms in 2024. That represents a nearly 10% decrease from the previous year.
Despite the decline, the AG is still sounding the alarm over the number of illegally-possessed firearms in the state.
“The data provided in this year’s report supports what we know to be true: Rhode Island has a gun problem,” Neronha wrote in the report submitted to Senate President Dominick J. Ruggerio and House Speaker K. Joseph Shekarchi. “Our communities continue to be inundated with firearms, and as you are aware, more guns in the hands of criminals means more gun violence and death.”
That’s been especially true regarding cases in recent years surrounding so-called “ghost guns,” firearms that are crafted at home using a 3D printer or a mail-order kit. Legislation passed in 2020 prohibits the possession, sale and manufacturing of these kinds of weapons. 
In 2022, Rhode Island saw 66 cases involving ghost guns but over the past two years that number has jumped. In 2023 there were 99 cases and last year, there were100 cases. Most of the guns were  produced with parts from Polymer80, one of the country’s largest manufacturers of ghost gun kits. 
In addition to the state’s ban on ghost guns, the AG reports ongoing violations of the law prohibiting gun magazines holding more than 10 rounds. The law was enacted in 2022 and was upheld by a federal appeals court  last March following a challenge from a group of gun owners who said the legislation violated the Second Amendment.
Prosecutors last year charged 246 cases involving magazines with capacity between 11 and 30 bullets — down 16% from 2023. Cases where someone owned magazines with the capacity for over 30 bullets rose 5%, according to the AG’s office.
Neronha touted that his office is “working tirelessly” to address illegally-owned firearms through enforcement of existing laws and advocating for new ones such as last year’s mandate that all firearms not in use by the owner or another authorized user be stored in a locked container or equipped with a tamper-resistant lock. 
The AG, along with Gov. Dan McKee and other general officers, are pushing lawmakers to ban assault-style weapons.
“Combatting gun violence is, and will always be, a top priority for my office,” Neronha wrote. “Rhode Islanders deserve to live long, happy lives free from the threat of gun violence, and we intend to continue doing everything we can to keep them safe.” 
Reached for comment on the latest data, spokespeople for the House and Senate said Shekarchi and Ruggerio had not yet reviewed the report. The same applies to Senate Minority Leader Jessica de la Cruz, a North Smithfield Republican who has been a staunch opponent of the state’s gun safety laws. 
The House Minority Office did not respond to immediate request for comment.

Mike Braun signed another round of bills into law Thursday. (Niki Kelly/Indiana Capital Chronicle)Indiana Gov. Mike Braun signed 20 bills into law Thursday, including one that would expunge certain civil “red flag” proceedings and another impacting carbon dioxide sequestration projects.
Lawmakers have sent Braun 38 bills thus far, and he has signed all of them.
House Enrolled Act 1137 would create a method to expunge “red flags” from a person’s public record. The Hoosier State’s red flag law allows police to temporarily remove firearms from people considered “dangerous,” with an aim to curb gun violence.
There are two situations in which a person might receive an expungement. First, if someone who was alleged to be dangerous was later found not to be. Second, if courts determined someone was dangerous, but after the person got help, deemed them safe.
Committee testimony revealed that Hoosiers had lost jobs and volunteer opportunities because of old red flag notices. An amendment clarified that law enforcement would still have access.
A bill on carbon dioxide sequestration projects also got a signature.
Senate Enrolled Act 457 exempts pipeline companies from needing to get certificates of authority in certain cases, creates a permit for exploratory wells and well conversions; adds inspection provisions; charges new fines for legal violations; and tweaks other fee amounts. Originally, fines and fees would’ve gone to dedicated funds to defray state spending on project administration and monitoring.
But an amendment in the Senate directs the money to the state’s General Fund instead. Lawmakers are still trying to find a compromise, which could be put in another piece of legislation before the session ends.
Braun also signed House Enrolled Act 1033, which seeks to reduce financial strain on construction contractors. It impacts only public works projects.
It eliminates the minimum retainage requirement for publicly funded projects and lowers the maximum withholding percentages by 4%. Retainage is the portion of payment withheld from a contractor or subcontractor until a construction project reaches substantial or full completion.
All of the legislation Braun has signed is listed online.

(Pat Sutphin for the Idaho Capital Sun)In what appears to be the near end of this year’s Idaho legislative session, Idaho Republican legislative leaders are backing — and quickly approving — a bill to let ivermectin be sold as an over-the-counter medicine.
Typically used to treat parasites in humans, ivermectin has drawn interest since the COVID pandemic — after largely conservative activists, doctors and politicians touted it as an alternative medicine. But the U.S. Food and Drug and Administration, or FDA, hasn’t approved ivermectin to treat or prevent COVID-19, saying the federal agency finds that existing clinical trial data don’t show “ivermectin is effective against COVID 19 in humans.”
Idaho’s Senate Bill 1211 would let ivermectin be sold over-the-counter, without a prescription or consultation with a health care professional.
On Monday, it was introduced. On Wednesday, it passed by a Senate committee. On Thursday, it passed the Senate. 
All that happened without public input from medical professionals. 
Dr. Sky Blue, who works with ivermectin in his practice as infectious disease doctor in Idaho, told the Idaho Capital Sun that the bill is part of a broader trend to promote unproven medical remedies and disregard their risks — over more proven treatments. 
“We have had very well done, well executed and favorable clinical trials showing that paxlovid, molnupiravir and remdesivir have positive effects (as anti-viral COVID treatments),” Blue said in a Tuesday interview. “And all the studies with ivermectin have not shown to have benefit,” adding that severe toxicities have been found in ivermectin’s COVID use.

 Many Idaho Republican senators tap into ivermectin cure-all rhetoric — conflicting with medical guidance

When he pitched the bill in committee on Wednesday, bill cosponsor Senate President Pro Tempore Kelly Anthon, R-Rupert, appeared to tap into the broader national rhetoric, saying ivermectin has been called a “wonder drug.”

“This is a drug that has had really immeasurable impacts on improving the lives of billions and billions of people throughout the world since it was discovered. It’s been called, in many places, a wonder drug,” Anthon, the top Idaho Senate Republican, told lawmakers in committee. “It’s been able to serve in treating and in many ways curing human diseases — treating parasites, worms in humans. And in most countries, it is legal over the counter.”
The Senate passed the bill on a 25-9 vote Thursday, sending the bill to the House. Five of the Senate’s six Democrats opposed the bill, joined by four Republicans; Democratic Sen. Ali Rabe, from Boise, was absent. 
The bill now heads to the House. To become law, Idaho bills must pass the House and Senate, and avoid the governor’s veto. 
If Idaho’s ivermectin deregulation bill becomes law, it would take effect immediately — through an emergency clause.
The bill is cosponsored by the top Republicans in the Idaho House and Senate — Anthon and House Speaker Mike Moyle, R-Star — along with two other lawmakers: Sen. Tammy Nichols, R-Middleton, and Rep. Jordan Redman, R-Coeur d’Alene.

 Sen. Tammy Nichols touts ivermectin as cureall. Doctors, FDA disagree. 

On Thursday, Republican lawmakers who debated in favor of the bill the Idaho Senate also tapped into the national cure-all rhetoric around ivermectin. 
In opening arguments for the bill on the Senate floor, Nichols spoke for about seven minutes — out of the roughly 35-minute debate.

She listed a range of ailments people have used ivermectin for.
“Some people will use it like taking vitamins,” Nichols told lawmakers.
The FDA warns that large doses of ivermectin “can be dangerous.” Overdoses can risk death, the federal regulator’s website says, and human-appropriate doses can interact with other medications, such as blood thinners. 
Anthon has said the bill would mean people aren’t turning to veterinarian sources to find the drug, arguing patients could use it more safely with better dosing information.

Stressing he wasn’t a doctor or pharmacist, Sen. Kevin Cook, R-Idaho Falls, said the doctors and pharmacists he’d talked with say making ivermectin available without a prescription is “not a good idea because there is no testing yet. … We don’t know all the benefits or the faults of it.” 
Usually, the FDA handles whether drugs should be made available over-the-counter, a process that uses data on safety and effectiveness.
Debating in favor of the bill, Sen. Carl Bjerke, R-Coeur d’Alene, incorrectly claimed the FDA never fully approved a COVID vaccine.
“If we’re using the FDA as the benchmark for what’s approved or not approved, if you trust that, I believe that — I don’t think the COVID shot ever got out of emergency use authorization. That was never approved by the FDA, as far as I’m concerned,” Bjerke told the Senate.

In 2021, the FDA approved Pfizer-BioNTech’s mRNA vaccine — which was the first COVID vaccine to advance past emergency use authorization. 
Two states allow ivermectin to be sold over-the-counter, according to local news reports: Arkansas passed a law this year, and Tennessee passed a law three years ago. North Carolina is considering a similar bill. 
 Some committee members worried about lack of doctor input

The lack of input from medical experts drew consternation from some lawmakers on the Senate State Affairs Committee, which spent about a half hour considering the bill on Wednesday.

In committee, Sen. Treg Bernt, R-Meridian, said he wanted to talk to a couple doctors about the bill. But he repeatedly suggested the bill’s risk wasn’t high.
“I’m not a tin-hat-wearing legislator. I’m not a conspiracy theorist. I think we’re going to be OK with ivermectin,” he said. “I’m not — certainly wouldn’t be against it, I guess. But I just … want to know more about it.”
On Thursday, Bernt voted for the bill on the Senate floor. 
The committee’s only Democrat, Sen. James Ruchti, D-Pocatello, said he’d oppose the bill. He said the drug is being politicized.
“Political reasons are not a good basis for making a decision to make a prescription drug an over-the-counter drug,” Ruchti said in committee. “That decision should be driven by the science. It should be driven by data and research. And we have none of that in front of us.”

The committee’s chairman, Sen. Jim Guthrie, R-McCannon, said he’d oppose the bill in committee but he might change his mind later.
His younger brother took ivermectin when he got COVID, and “he thought he was going to die,” Guthrie told the committee.
“Now, was that the ivermectin or advanced COVID? Who knows. But he felt like it could have very, very well been the ivermectin. Did he think that if a little’s good, a lot will do better? Possibly. And maybe that’s … the risk you take when you don’t have that consultation,” Guthrie said. 
Guthrie opposed the bill on the Senate floor, joined by three other Republican lawmakers: Sens. Van Burtenshaw, from Terreton; Cook; and Dave Lent, from Idaho Falls. 
 What the committee heard: Opposition from pharmacy industry representative, and support from attorney

Only two people testified on the bill:

Brian Festa, an attorney who is the co-founder of the nonprofit Caldwell-based public interest law firm We The Patriots USA. Saying he represented himself, Festa testified briefly in support of the bill. He referenced a lawsuit his law firm was involved in over a Minnesota patient’s struggle to get ivermectin as a need for the bill. 
And Pam Eaton, the CEO of the Idaho Retailers Association which represents Idaho pharmacies. In the past eight hours, she told the committee she’d heard from more pharmacists than she’d heard from throughout this year’s Idaho legislative session, adding that 99% of people she’d heard from were opposed to the bill. 

Eaton said without an over-the-counter label, pharmacies can’t sell ivermectin over-the-counter. Some might be able to, but she said most are saying they can’t.
Throughout her testimony, Eaton stressed she is not a pharmacist. But she relayed patient safety concerns she said she’d heard from a pharmacist about ivermectin.
“It has serious interactions with five medications, and requires close monitoring with 51 medications, including commonly used antibiotics, cholesterol, heart medications and other (over-the-counter) antihistamines,” Eaton said. 
That’s the sort of information that would be on an over-the-counter medication label, she added.

Sharice Davids, both Kansas Democrats, object to President Donald Trump's imposition of sweeping trade tariffs because the result will undermine the agriculture economy and raise consumer prices. (Kansas Reflector screen capture of Democratic Governors Association's YouTube channel)TOPEKA — Gov. Laura Kelly condemned as unacceptable the imposition of sweeping tariffs on dozens of U.S. trading partners by President Donald Trump because of damage to the Kansas agriculture economy and additional financial pressure on consumers struggling with inflation.
Kelly, chair of the Democratic Governors Association, said Trump’s commitment to a chaotic global trade war was contrary to the president’s 2024 campaign promise to tamp down the plague of domestic inflation. Trump’s latest 10% across-the-board tariffs on U.S. imports amplified the prospect of international retaliation against goods exported by the United States. On Thursday, Wall Street fell into sharp decline as concern about recession in the United States and abroad escalated.
“As the governor of Kansas, a state whose farmers feed the nation and the world, the imposition of tariffs without consideration of the immediate and devastating impact on our agricultural industry and others, is unacceptable,” Kelly said.
The two-term Democratic governor said Americans didn’t elect Trump so the Republican president could foster “chaos, anxiety and uncertainty for businesses and consumers across the nation.” She said Trump’s perspective on tariffs, or international trade taxes, made it difficult for Kansas farmers to plan for the future. She said Trump’s tariffs were expected to cost U.S. families more than $5,000 per year.
“The cost of living is the number one issue, not only on Kansans’ minds, but on the minds of families across the country,” Kelly said. “From groceries to gas to housing, too many families are struggling to get by and are looking to their leaders for real solutions.”
Kelly said 36 states would conduct elections of governors in 2026, and “Republicans running for governor won’t be able to run” from Trump’s destructive tariffs.
While Kansas Republicans have been loathe to publicly criticize Trump’s trade agenda, U.S. Sen. Chuck Grassley, R-Iowa, and Sen. Maria Cantwell, D-Washington, introduced a bill that would provide Congress more leverage in terms of setting tariffs.
U.S. Rep. Sharice Davids, a Kansas Democrat serving the 3rd District centered on the Kansas City region, said Kansans would be forced to foot the bill for Trump’s misguided leadership.
“His trade policies are driving up grocery costs, forcing Kansas businesses to close and cutting off markets for our farmers,” said Davids, who serves on the House Agriculture Committee. “I’m focused on pursuing smart trade agreements that strengthen American industries without putting jobs and small businesses at risk.”
Davids said the right-leaning Tax Foundation reported tariffs enacted during Trump’s first term were paid for by U.S. consumers and businesses as the cost of trade barriers filtered down.
On Wednesday, Trump announced tariffs of at least 10% on most goods coming into the United States. He vowed to impose higher import taxes on dozens of countries and territories. Trump’s plan included tariff rates of 34% on China, 20% on the European Union and 46% on Vietnam.
Trump maintained tariffs would help the U.S. economy by bringing back manufacturing jobs. He asserted it was necessary for the United States to respond aggressively because “our country has been looted, pillaged, raped and plundered” by trading partners for decades.
Critics of Trump’s trade offensive viewed tariffs as a regressive tax, especially in the short run, because the financial burden of higher prices fell on households at the bottom of the economic scale rather than people at the top of the income ladder.
Connecticut Gov. Ned Lamont joined Kelly for the video news conference hosted by the Democratic Governors Association.
“A tariff is a six letter word for tax, and this is a tax on the American people,” Lamont said. “I see that Donald Trump is calling today ‘Liberation Day.’ As far as I can see, the only thing being liberated will be two, three, four hundred dollars a month out of your wallet.”",https://kansasreflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Kelly-tariffs-1024x526.png,,,2025-04-03 16:04:16.203427

The Oklahoma State Department of Health reported this week that people may have been exposed at the OU Health’s Children’s Hospital on March 23 from 6:15 p.m. to 10 p.m. in the facility’s emergency department, atrium and elevators.
People may have been exposed to the virus at Luigi’s Italian Restaurant and Lounge in Weatherford between 5:30 p.m. and 9 p.m on March 19. 
Officials said if people were not at the listed locations during those timeframes, there is no risk of exposure, but those who were should “exclude themselves from public setting for 21 days” if they are not vaccinated or have not previously had the infection. They’re also urged to report suspected exposure to state health officials.  
Oklahoma health officials reported the first cases of measles in the state last month. All 10 patients are unvaccinated or their vaccination status is unknown, according to data released this week by health officials.
The initial cases were reported in Owasso and Claremore areas. They were linked to an outbreak in Texas and New Mexico, which has sickened over 470 people and killed two. 
Health officials said two doses of the Measles, Mumps and Rubella vaccine are 97% effective at preventing the disease while one dose is about 93% effective.
Measles is contagious four days before the onset of the rash and until five days after the rash appears, according to the Health Department website.

State records indicate Angela Jansen of Central City worked for the DNR as a conservation officer from October 2018 to August 2023, when she was fired for conduct unbecoming a state employee and for the unauthorized personal use of a DNR database.
Jansen recently filed a lawsuit against the DNR in Polk County District Court, alleging the department violated her civil rights when it fired her as a result of post-traumatic stress disorder triggered by fatalities she encountered at work.
In her lawsuit, Jansen says she “witnessed multiple critical incidents involving the tragic deaths of others,” including a 2018 incident during her field training when a pickup truck become engulfed in flames and the occupant was unable to escape the vehicle.
In 2019, the lawsuit alleges, Jansen witnessed a second catastrophic vehicle accident at work where she was unable to assist the victims. “After witnessing these horrific events, Jansen was not offered any counseling or other services, in violation of department policy,” the lawsuit claims. “As a result, her mental health began to deteriorate.”
In May 2023, Jansen alleges, she was involved in an on-duty incident where a person drowned and again, the department failed to follow its critical incident policy by requiring her to attend mandatory counseling.
Jansen alleges that on the evening of June 14, 2023, while off duty in Ankeny, she consumed alcohol as a mechanism to cope with her mental health struggles. Officers from the Ankeny Police Department provided Jansen with a ride home later that same evening, the lawsuit claims.
On June 28, 2023, Jansen was informed by the DNR that she was suspended pending an investigation into her conduct. A month later, Jansen’s medical provider diagnosed her with post-traumatic stress disorder and she requested a leave of absence from the department, proposing the department pause its personnel investigation into her conduct on June 14, 2023, so that she could first obtain treatment. On Aug. 2, Jansen was fired.
State alleges unprofessional conduct
Jansen’s lawsuit seeks unspecified damages for disability discrimination, failure to accommodate a disability, retaliation, and violations of the Iowa Civil Rights Act.
The state has yet to file a response to the lawsuit. However, it did challenge Jansen’s claim for unemployment benefits after her dismissal. In that case, the state alleged that during the June 14, 2023, incident, Jansen was off duty and on a date while carrying her service weapon in her purse. At some point in the evening, Jansen called an ex-boyfriend to come pick her up from her date.
The ex-boyfriend is a felon, according to state records, and while he and Jansen were in his car the two began arguing. The argument escalated to the point where the ex-boyfriend’s Apple watch determined there was an emergency of some kind and dialed 911 without the two realizing it.
Ankeny police arrived on the scene and began investigating the matter. The DNR’s law enforcement bureau chief, Craig Cutts, later testified that he reviewed the officers’ body-camera footage and saw video of Jansen telling the responding officers she had a gun in her purse. When asked why she had a gun, Jansen reportedly identified herself as a DNR officer.
During the discussion with police, Jansen allegedly asked one of the officers if he dated older women and referred to him as “Officer Hot Stuff,” the DNR later alleged. In addition, she reportedly admitted more than once that it was likely that she was drunk at the time, then informed the officers she had used a state database maintained by the DNR to determine the marital status of at least one person she was considering dating.
Ankeny police did not arrest Jansen or issue any citations, but they did confiscate the purse with the gun in it and drove Jansen home where they returned the items.
Shortly thereafter, Jansen reported some details of the incident to Cutts. Jansen’s direct supervisor, Capt.  Deb Vitko, then contacted Cutts and allegedly told him she had heard about the incident over the police radio and there was more to the story than what Jansen had self-reported. She reportedly told Cutts about the firearm and said there appeared to be some question as to whether the ex-boyfriend had been held against his will.
Cutts then initiated an investigation and reviewed the body-camera footage and police reports.  The department ultimately concluded Jansen had acted in a manner unbecoming of a state employee and that she had improperly accessed and then used information from the DNR database.
Jansen’s application for jobless benefits was later decided by Administrative Law Judge Alexis Rowe who ruled that Jansen’s off-duty behavior was disqualifying job-related misconduct.
Jansen “acted inappropriately with a police officer, asking him if he dated older women and calling him ‘Officer Hot Stuff,’” Rowe stated. The judge added that Jansen “also admitted more than once that it was likely she was drunk. These actions were objectively harmful to the employer’s interests in maintaining the reputation of professionalism for its officers.”
According to state records, Jansen had one previous disciplinary warning for conduct unbecoming a state employee. That warning, which was coupled with a suspension, was issued in June 2021 after Jansen was arrested for drunken driving in Linn County where tests showed she had a blood-alcohol level of .172 percent — more than twice the legal limit.
In that case, Jansen was convicted of first-offense drunken driving and sentenced to 48 hours in jail to be served on weekends.",https://iowacapitaldispatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/DNR-lawsuit.jpg,,,2025-04-03 15:10:22.316581

(gregobagel/Getty Images)Washington is suing a property management software company and a handful of landlords over allegations they colluded to inflate rents through a price-fixing scheme, Attorney General Nick Brown announced Thursday.
The state says RealPage has three products to help landlords calculate rental prices and manage occupancy. The company uses nonpublic information that landlords agree to share to create an algorithm that pushes them to raise rents, according to the lawsuit filed in King County Superior Court. 
Instead of competing, the landlords all raise their prices together based on RealPage’s recommendations, according to the complaint. So instead of the market helping determine rents, it’s software.
RealPage also tells landlords to nix discounts they give to attract tenants, the lawsuit alleges. And it reportedly recommends keeping units vacant to keep rents up, instead of leasing them for a lower price.
In a press conference Thursday, Brown said property managers used the Texas-based RealPage software to price an estimated 800,000 leases in Washington between 2017 and 2024. About a third of Washington residents are renters, according to the lawsuit.
In 2023, more than half of Washington’s renters paid more than 30% of their income toward rent, according to a state report released in December.
“Pricing is higher and occupancy is lower for properties managed by landlords using RealPage than for those that don’t,” Brown said. “Washington needs a competitive market to help with our critical shortage of affordable, multifamily housing. RealPage’s unfair practices are drowning renters and pricing more and more families out of stable housing in Washington.”
The lawsuit alleges RealPage and nine landlords violated the state’s Consumer Protection Act by stifling competition.
“It’s price fixing, it’s illegal and it hurts Washingtonians,” Brown said.
Chris Vialpando, a renter in Seattle’s Lower Queen Anne neighborhood, said his landlord raised his rent over 50% in 2022 based on RealPage’s algorithm. He said he is one of many “falling victim to the collusion, thereby perpetuating this already complex, systemic housing crisis.”
“And I also understand that inflation and market adjustments are naturally part of the rental economy, but what I don’t understand is how these predatory companies can continue to operate freely without continuous authoritative examination and scrutiny,” Vialpando said.
The company didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment Thursday.
Gov. Bob Ferguson, when he was still attorney general, launched an investigation into the RealPage software in early 2023. 
The investigation came on the heels of a ProPublica report on RealPage’s algorithm that found just 10 property managers oversaw 70% of apartments in a Seattle neighborhood. All of them used RealPage’s pricing software.
The state had previously been part of an ongoing federal lawsuit along with other states and the U.S. Department of Justice over antitrust concerns, but dropped out of that case in late February. The attorney general’s office withdrew from that lawsuit because “we saw a bigger problem,” Brown said.
“We saw a conspiracy, and we saw a greater path to help more renters,” he said. “We filed this case in state court because we believe that state law protects a greater number of Washingtonians and tenants than the federal case.”
Tenants across the country have also brought a class-action lawsuit against RealPage and its property management clients that is ongoing in federal court in Tennessee. 
Washington’s lawsuit asks a judge to declare the conduct illegal, award restitution and hand down civil penalties.
The landlords named as defendants in the complaint are Greystar, Cushman & Wakefield, LivCor, UDR, Prime Administration, Quarterra Multifamily Communities, LaSalle Properties, MG Properties and Sares Regis Management Company.
Lawmakers in Olympia are also looking to ban algorithmic rental price-fixing this year. Senate Bill 5469 would prohibit the collection of data that feeds recommendations for rental rates and bar landlords from obtaining those recommendations. The attorney general would enforce violations of the proposed law.
The state Senate passed the measure on a party-line vote this month, and it is now moving through the House.
This week, RealPage sued the city of Berkeley, California, over a similar ordinance aimed at stopping landlords from using algorithms to set rents.
In an interview the day he took office in January, the new attorney general said one of his top priorities was tackling “unjust, illegal, misleading business practices” in the housing sector.
“It’s our job to be a watchdog, and make sure that housing is affordable and available for everyone,” Brown said at the time.",https://washingtonstatestandard.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/fremont-seattle-1024x685.jpg,,,2025-04-03 15:10:22.316581

(Photo by YouraPechkin/	iStock / Getty Images Plus)Sue Sheridan’s baby boy, Cal, suffered brain damage from undetected jaundice in 1995. Helen Haskell’s 15-year-old son, Lewis, died after surgery in 2000 because weekend hospital staffers didn’t realize he was in shock.
The episodes turned both women into advocates for patients and spurred research that made American health care safer.
On April 1, the Trump administration slashed the organization that supported that research — the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality, or AHRQ — and fired roughly half of its remaining employees as part of a perplexing reorganization of the federal Health and Human Services Department.
Haskell, of Columbia, South Carolina, has done research and helped write AHRQ-published surveys and guidebooks on patient engagement for hospitals. The dissolution of AHRQ is dislodging scores of experienced patient-safety experts, a brain drain that will be impossible to rectify, she said.
Survey data gathered by AHRQ provides much of what is known about hospitalizations for motor accidents, measles, methamphetamine, and thousands of other medical issues.
“Nobody does these things except AHRQ,” she said. “They’re all we’ve got. And now the barn door’s closed.”
HHS Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. posted on the social platform X on April 1 that layoffs at HHS, aimed at reducing the department’s workforce by about 20,000 employees, were the result of alleged inefficacy.
“What we’ve been doing isn’t working,” he said. “Despite spending $1.9 trillion in annual costs, Americans are getting sicker every year.”
But neither Kennedy nor President Donald Trump have explained why individual agencies such as AHRQ were targeted for cuts or indicated whether any of their work would continue.
At their first meeting with the leadership of AHRQ last month, officials from Trump’s Department of Government Efficiency said that they didn’t know what the agency did — and that its budget would be cut by 80% to 90%, according to two people with knowledge of the meeting who were granted anonymity because of fears of retribution.
On March 28, the administration said AHRQ would merge with HHS’ Office of the Assistant Secretary for Planning and Evaluation.
An AHRQ spokesperson, Rachel Seeger, said its acting chief, Mamatha Pancholi, was unavailable to answer questions.
Created on the foundation of an earlier agency in 1999, AHRQ has had two major functions: collecting survey data on U.S. health care expenditures, experiences, and outcomes; and funding research aimed at improving the safety and delivery of health care. It also has published tools and guidelines to enhance patient safety.
Its latest budget of $513 million amounts to about 0.04% of HHS spending.
Newly sworn-in Food and Drug Administration Commissioner Marty Makary, a surgeon who has advocated for patient safety, wrote or co-authored at least 10 research papers supported by AHRQ funding since 1998.
AHRQ research and guidelines played a key role in lowering the incidence of hospital-acquired infections — such as deadly blood infections caused by contaminated IV lines, which fell 28% from 2015 to 2023, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
Medical residents training in the 1980s were taught that such infections were an inevitable, often fatal byproduct of heart surgery, but AHRQ-funded research “showed that fairly simple checklists about preventing infections would be effective at going to zero,” said Richard Kronick, a University of California-San Diego researcher who led AHRQ from 2013 to 2016.
Medical errors caused by missed diagnoses, drug errors, hospital infections, and other factors kill and maim tens of thousands of Americans each year. Makary published a controversial study in 2016 hypothesizing that errors killed 250,000 people a year in the U.S. — making medical mistakes the nation’s third-leading cause of death.
“There are all kinds of terrible things about our health care system’s outcomes and how we pay for it, the most expensive care in the world,” Kronick said. “Without AHRQ, we’d be doing even worse.”
AHRQ-funded researchers such as Hardeep Singh at Baylor College of Medicine have chipped away at patient safety risks for more than two decades. Singh devises ways to integrate technologies like telemedicine and artificial intelligence into electronic health records to alert doctors to potential prescribing errors or misdiagnoses.
Singh has 15 scholars and support staff members supported by three AHRQ grants worth about $1.5 million, he said. The elimination of the agency’s office that funds outside researchers, among the cuts announced this week, is potentially “career-ending,” he said. “We need safety research to protect our patients from harms in health care. No organization in the world does more for that than AHRQ.”
Republicans have long been skeptical of AHRQ and the agency that preceded it. Some doctors saw it as meddling in their medical practices, while some GOP Congress members viewed it as duplicating the mission of the National Institutes of Health.
But when the Trump administration proposed merging it with NIH in 2018, a House-ordered study into health research priorities validated AHRQ’s valuable role.
Now, the naysayers have triumphed.
Gordon Schiff, a Harvard Medical School internist who has received AHRQ funding since 2001, was among the first to learn about policy changes there when in February he got an email from the editors of an AHRQ patient-safety website informing him “regretfully” that a 2022 case study on suicide prevention he co-authored had been removed “due to a perception that it violates the White House policy on websites ‘that inculcate or promote gender ideology.’”
The article was not about gender issues. It briefly mentioned that LGBTQ men were at a higher risk for suicide than the general population. Schiff was offered the option of removing the LGBTQ reference but refused. He and Harvard colleague Celeste Royce have sued AHRQ, HHS, and the Office of Personnel Management over removal of the article.
“All we were doing was presenting evidence-based risk factors from the literature,” he said. “To censor them would be a violation of scientific integrity and undermine the trustworthiness of these websites.”
PSNet, the AHRQ publication where Schiff and Royce’s article appeared, has been dissolved, although its website was still up as of April 2. Roughly half of AHRQ’s 300 staffers resigned following the initial DOGE warning; 111 staff members were fired April 1, according to an email that a top executive, Jeffrey Toven, sent to employees and was shown to KFF Health News. AHRQ’s remaining leadership was in the dark about Kennedy’s plans, he said.
HHS spokespeople did not respond to requests for comment.
Stephen Parente, a University of Minnesota finance professor who said he consults informally with Trump health officials, said much of AHRQ’s work could be done by others. Its most vital services have been surveys that Westat, a private research company, performs for AHRQ on contract, said Parente, who was chief economist for health policy in the first Trump administration.
At the height of the COVID-19 pandemic, he said, data produced by AHRQ and other government sources were outclassed by private sources. To track COVID, he relied on daily feeds of private insurance data from around the country.
Still, Parente said, the virtual disappearance of AHRQ means “we’re going to lose a culture of research that is measured, thoughtful, and provides a channel for young investigators to make their marks.”
The Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services and the CDC conduct some health system quality research, but they are also losing staff, Harvard’s Schiff noted.
One of Schiff’s current AHRQ projects involved interviewing late-stage cancer patients to determine whether they could have been diagnosed earlier.
“The general public, I think, would like cancer to be diagnosed earlier, not when it’s stage 4 or stage 3,” he said. “There are things we could learn to improve our care and get more timely diagnosis of cancer.”
“Medical errors and patient safety risks aren’t going to go away on their own,” he said.
With input from Sheridan and other mothers of children who suffered from jaundice-related brain damage, AHRQ launched research that led to a change in the standard of care whereby all newborns in the U.S. are tested for jaundice before discharge from hospitals. Cases of jaundice-related brain damage declined from 7 per 100,000 to about 2 per 100,000 newborns from 1997 to 2012.
The misfortune of Lewis, Haskell’s son, led to a change in South Carolina law — the bipartisan Lewis Blackman Hospital Patient Safety Act of 2005 — and later to a national requirement for hospitals to enable patients to demand emergency responses under certain circumstances.
Singh, a leading researcher on AI in health care, sees bitter irony in the way the Elon Musk-led DOGE has taken an ax to AHRQ, which recently put out a new request for proposals to study the technology. “Some think AI will fix health care without a human in the loop,” Singh said. “I doubt we get there by dismantling people who support or perform patient safety research. You need a human in the loop.”

(Cindy Gonzalez/Nebraska Examiner)OMAHA — It was not your typical day in the Nebraska Supreme Court.
Chief Justice Jeffrey Funke and six associate justices donned their traditional black robes and convened to hear customary oral arguments — but only after maneuvering past the theater props, art supplies and other items common to the back stage of a school auditorium.
The state’s high court judges peppered attorneys with questions about the appellate case at hand. But in a different twist afterward, they faced their own barrage of questions from a group of curious teenagers.

Wednesday’s official Supreme Court proceedings played out on a stage at Omaha Bryan High School. Taking a real-life court session out of the State Capitol and on the road was part of the Court’s efforts to increase public understanding and trust in the judicial system, and to inspire more young people to join the legal profession.
 Real people

For Kyra Carpenter, editor-in-chief of the Bryan High Orator, the event on Bear turf pulled back the curtain on a system she had only read about. She said she came to school “really nervous” to ask questions of the justices, but later felt at ease. 
“They seem more like people, more real,” the junior said after the event. “They even laughed at one of my jokes.”
Saúl Muñoz-Macias, also a junior, said he will be the first in his family to go to college when he pursues a political science and economics degree on the way to law school. 
“It’s cool to see this,” the 16-year-old said. “I’d like to be in a position like them some day.”

Joining Funke on the auditorium stage — before an audience of about 50 students from the school’s classes on American Government, Law and Juvenile Justice and AP History  — were Justices Lindsey Miller-Lerman, William Cassel, Jonathan Papik, Stephanie Stacy, John Freudenberg and Jason Bergevin. 
The Supreme Court, supported by the Nebraska State Bar Foundation, holds such school-based court sessions a few times a year in various parts of the state. A similar event was held earlier in the day at Creighton University School of Law.
While intended as outreach and education for students, Funke said in an interview that he believes judges also reap benefits.
“They ask us questions, they challenge us, and it makes us think a little bit about what we do, how we do it, why we do it and if there are ways we can do it better,” said Funke, a graduate of the University of Nebraska College of Law who was appointed to the Supreme Court in 2016 and elevated to chief justice last year.
 ‘Now a courtroom’ 

At Bryan, official business came to order about 1:30 p.m. with a shout from a member of the Nebraska State Patrol: “This room is now a courtroom…Welcome to the Supreme Court.” 
A student bailiff gave the “all rise” alert. Prior to that, the Patrol had searched and secured the school grounds. Student ambassadors escorted justices backstage, where they assembled before taking their seats.

 The spotlighted case had to do with a battle over a roadway, and a “prescriptive easement,” which is a legal right to use someone else’s property based upon a long-term, consistent and open use of that property without the expressed consent of the owner.
In this situation, a family had owned a swath of land in Otoe County since 1857. But the Little Nemaha River cuts off part of the property to the south, making it inaccessible to vehicles or farm machinery except by crossing through the neighboring Dowding property. 
The Dowding property owners grew frustrated enough to lock an access gate, which pushed the other family to sue, and a district court granted them access based on prescriptive easement. 
Attorneys David Domina and Ryan McIntosh argued their respective sides, and justices asked a lot of questions.
“I wasn’t expecting the judges to just interrupt them like they did — I was like, ‘Oh,’” said Kyra.
 Inquisition

Perhaps the tougher inquisition came after attorneys wrapped up their arguments, and as students stepped up to question the justices.
One teen wanted to know the judges’ most difficult or impactful case.
For Funke, that was deciding as a trial judge the fate of a child in a custody or divorce situation.

“What you want and what you can do sometimes are two different things,” he said. “You know the importance of it and if you get it wrong, the impact is significant for that child.”
Cassel talked about death penalty decisions.
“A very solemn and complicated undertaking,” he said, adding that such cases fortunately aren’t frequent. “That’s probably the highest single responsibility that one of us can have — (rendering) our judgement whether someone lives or dies.”
Asked to describe “most interesting” cases, Miller-Lerman recalled the Beatrice Six. Miller-Lerman — the first woman on the Nebraska Supreme Court and longest-serving member of the current high court — wrote the 7-0 opinion in 2007 that allowed DNA testing for two men in the Beatrice Six who had been convicted of murder in 1989.
Results showed neither man had committed the crime, leading to the exoneration of them and four others who had falsely confessed. They won a wrongful conviction judgement of $28 million.
Students ventured into politics, with one wondering if justices believed the country was in a “constitutional crisis” between the Trump administration and the courts.
Cassel suggested the student google President Franklin D. Roosevelt’s “court-packing plan” and said, “We aren’t even close.”











We think it’s important you trust your judiciary. That’s why we take these opportunities.


– Chief Justice Jeffrey Funke



Another wanted to know if the justices feared for their jobs under Donald Trump’s administration, given that the president called for the removal of a judge who ruled against deportation plans.
Funke used the moment to delve into differences between Nebraska’s method of appointing and removing judges versus that of the federal government. In Nebraska, he noted, voters choose whether a judge should be retained. In a case of alleged bad behavior, a process overseen by a Judicial Qualifications Commission made up of attorneys and lay persons can sanction or remove a judge from the bench.
In response to a question about $80 million being poured into a Wisconsin Supreme Court race, Cassel differentiated between states that elect their judges and Nebraska, where the governor appoints judges from candidates submitted by a nominating commission. 
To one student’s observation that the high court spent a lot of time obsessing over terms such as consent and prescriptive and necessity easements, Papik said law school would prepare them for this new vocabulary.
“Much of what you’re doing is learning a new language,” he said.
 Building trust

When asked what the Supreme Court does to earn high school students’ trust, Stacy said: “We’re here.”

She said the hope is students “learn a little about how the process works.” She added, “Some of you might even be thinking, ‘Law school doesn’t sound horrible.’”
Stacy touched upon open access to courts, cameras in the courtroom, publicly broadcasted proceedings. “We don’t do our work in secret,” she told the teens.
Funke said if the Court loses its authority, rule of law gives way to survival of the fittest, and whoever is the strongest, has the most muscle or guns, he said.
“We think it’s important you trust your judiciary,” he said. “That’s why we take these opportunities.”

Students got a primer ahead of the proceedings from a couple of local lawyers: Abigail Moland of the Omaha McGrath North law firm and Ceci Menjivar, a Douglas County assistant public defender, who also is a Bryan alumna.
“It’s a great opportunity to give back and have Latino students see there are attorneys that look like them … and let them know ways they can contribute.”
Bryan Principal Anthony “CK” Clark-Kaczmarek said he wasn’t sure how his school was selected as a site, but that he jumped at what would be a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity for many in the student body.
“I loved that our kids were so fearless in the question-asking,” he said, adding that they hear a lot of news and were eager to hear the perspective of the state’s highest-level judges.
“All students really want to know is that things are going to be okay — that government is going to do the right thing and protect them.”
 ‘Back to the normal’

As is standard, the Supreme Court did not immediately announce a determination on the civil case argued Wednesday, Fey v. Olson. The Court relays decisions in written opinions filed with the Court’s clerk.

The justices stuck around to take photos with students. The principal took a selfie with the justices and students, at the urging of Carpenter. Funke said such road trips help the court reset.
He said he appreciated the atmosphere — the occasional school bell during proceedings, voices from hallways. He got a kick out of assembling with fellow judges backstage amid drama props, a change from pristine quarters in the Capitol.
“It kinda brings you back to the normal, everyday world,” said Funke.

(Photo: John Partipilo/Tennessee Lookout)The Tennessee Senate on Thursday approved legislation that could subject churches and charitable organizations to lawsuits if they provide housing aid to immigrants without legal status who go on to commit a crime. 
The bill (SB227/HB11)  by Sen. Brent Taylor of Memphis and Rep. Rusty Grills of Newbern, has drawn pushback from some faith leaders who contend it is a violation of their religious freedom and their faith-based mission to care for the stranger, and all those in need. 
The bill has yet to reach the House floor for a vote.
The bill doesn’t explicitly bar churches or nonprofit organizations from providing aid to legal or illegal immigrants, Taylor noted. But organizations that do so knowingly, he said, are undertaking a “misguided mission.”
  Churches that help immigrants who are in the U.S. without permanent legal status have a “misguided mission,” said Sen. Brent Taylor, a Memphis Republican. (Photo: John Partipilo/Tennessee Lookout)
“All it says is if you have assisted an illegal alien, and they commit a criminal act, then you can be held civilly liable,” Taylor said. 
“It doesn’t stop from them from doing it, if that’s their misguided mission — that they want to try and bring in people who are in our country illegally and help them establish themselves in our community — then they need to better vet and supervise the illegal aliens that are in the community that they have helped bring there.”
Sen. Jeff Yarbro, a Nashville Democrat, noted the bill makes changes to a portion of Tennessee’s “Good Samaritan” statutes, which are designed to shield individuals and organizations that provide aid from lawsuits.
“What we are doing here is we are literally limiting the application of the Good Samaritan law,” Yarbro said. 
“We’re drawing in churches like the Catholic Church, which is focused on a great deal of work in housing and working with distressed communities — and frankly churches all across the state and other and non religious charitable orgs as well — and exposing them to civil liability for crimes committed by someone they helped.”
Taylor’s own pastor, Matt Crawford of Trinity Baptist Church in Cordova,  has pushed back against the notion churches should refrain from ministering to individuals without legal status, delivering a sermon in January that said “I don’t know the legal status of all our people who come to ESL. I don’t think we’re called on to police that as a church.”
The sermon, Fox13 Memphis reported, prompted Taylor to walk out.
Taylor told the Lookout last month that his message to churches was this:
“I would remind the churches that even heaven has an immigration policy,” he said. “You can’t climb over the wall in heaven.  You can’t slick talk St. Peter into the gates of heaven. There’s a very specific way you come into heaven to become a resident of heaven. They’ve got a very strict immigration policy, and I don’t think it’s unreasonable for Americans to have an immigration policy that people follow.”
Bills that target immigrant-serving nonprofits raise criticism from faith community 

The proposed legislation applies to Tennessee charities and churches that knowingly provide long term housing aid to individuals without legal status, including the act of providing assistance in obtaining or signing a lease.
The bill specifically excludes “temporary overnight housing,” such as services provided by homeless shelters, from liability. The bill’s language makes no specific exception for domestic violence shelters.
Under Tennessee’s personal injury laws, most crime victims and their survivors may sue for up to $1 million in non-economic damages and  $500,000 in punitive damages against those they are seeking to hold liable. There is no cap on economic damages, including lost wages and hospital bills.

Stebbins wrote in a memo announcing the investigation that the Inspector General Act of 1978 “authorizes us to have access to personnel and materials as we determine necessary to perform our oversight in a timely manner.”The purpose of the evaluation, he wrote, “is to determine the extent to which the Secretary of Defense and other DoD personnel complied with DoD policies and procedures for the use of a commercial messaging application for official business. Additionally, we will review compliance with classification and records retention requirements.”The investigation will take place in Washington, D.C., as well as U.S. Central Command Headquarters in Tampa, Florida.Concerns about the use of Signal, an encrypted messaging app available commercially, began after The Atlantic published an article detailing how its editor-in-chief, Jeffrey Goldberg, was inadvertently added to a group chat exchanging messages about national security plans. The ensuing controversy has been dubbed “Signalgate.”Vice President J.D. Vance, Hegseth, Secretary of State Marco Rubio, Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard, CIA Director John Ratcliffe, National Security Advisor Michael Waltz and others were all in the group.They were discussing plans for U.S. troops to bomb Houthi rebels in Yemen, which has raised significant concerns about how senior Trump administration officials are communicating and handling classified information.",,,,2025-04-03 15:10:22.316581

(Photo by Cecilia Lynch/USDA)Previously frozen funding from the U.S. Department of Agriculture’s Rural Development Office has been released, funding rural energy projects and infrastructure for selling ethanol blended fuels at gas pumps. 
USDA Secretary Brooke Rollins announced this week that funding allocated through the Higher Blends Infrastructure Incentive Program, or HBIIP, and the Rural Energy for America Program, or REAP, will be released, though the latter program requires an adjustment to projects. 
HBIIP, which funds projects to upgrade rural fuel stations to sell ethanol-blended fuels, like E15, E85, and B20, at the pump, was released for 543 projects, totaling $537 million, in 29 states. More than $4.5 million of HBIIP cost-share grants were awarded to upgrade Iowa fuel stations in a January allocation of the program. 
Rollins made the announcement during her first official visit to Iowa while at Elite Octane, an ethanol facility in Atlantic. Iowa officials, including Gov. Kim Reynolds, Iowa Secretary of Agriculture Mike Naig, U.S. Sen. Joni Ernst, U.S. Rep. Mariannette Miller-Meeks and U.S. Rep. Zach Nunn were also in attendance.

Ernst, who pushed for HBIIP funding in the past and for expanded access to ethanol fuel blends, thanked Rollins for creating “certainty” for farmers and biofuel producers in Iowa. 
“I’ve worked hard to help develop and maintain HBIIP over the years to ensure that from Casey’s to your local mom-and-pop gas stations, retail store owners have the tools they need to deliver higher blends of biofuels at the pump, expanding access to homegrown fuels and choices for consumers,” Ernst said in a statement. “This is another example of how the Trump administration is putting our rural communities first.”
Rollins said the announcement was part of the president’s “commitment to America’s farmers, ranchers and small businesses.” 
“Under the president’s leadership, we are moving away from the harmful effects of misguided climate policies like the Green New Deal,” Rollins said in a statement. “Instead, USDA will deploy energy investments that prioritize the needs of our rural communities.” 
On Jan. 14, USDA Rural Development announced a round of funding awards for REAP and HBIIP, with more than $5.6 million in grants benefitting Iowa businesses and communities. Nationally, USDA invested more than $3 billion in REAP projects and $323 million in HBIIP programs during the Biden-Harris administration. 
The latest round of funding, along with some previous rounds of the programs, was suspended by the Trump administration as part of the president’s day-one order to pause and evaluate programs established by former President Joe Biden’s Inflation Reduction Act. 
Iowa Renewable Fuels Association Executive Director Monte Shaw thanked Rollins for releasing the HBIIP funds and for noting the importance of the E-15, a fuel blend with a higher percentage of ethanol, in administration’s plan for “unleashing American energy.” 
“E15 is the only untapped, near-term market opportunity for American farmers and producers large enough to make a meaningful difference to today’s low prices,” Shaw said. 
IRFA and Attorney General Brenna Bird have urged congressional leaders to pass legislation that would permit the year-round sale of the fuel. A press release from USDA said the department is “aggressively exploring” ways to support the biofuels industry and to allow year-round E-15 sales. 
Ernst and U.S. Sen. Chuck Grassley were among 17 senators who signed a letter to the president Thursday urging permits for E-15 sales. 
“Utilizing American ethanol year-round is a direct solution to reinforcing our energy supply and reducing consumer costs, and the issuance of a nationwide waiver for the 2025 summer driving season is a clear path toward these shared goals,” the letter read.
REAP released, but with a catch 
REAP has funded initiatives such as rooftop solar power on small rural businesses and farms, energy efficiency upgrades including new refrigeration at rural grocery stores and other upgrades aimed at farm or rural business equipment. 
The USDA has said previously obligated recipients have 30 days, or until April 24, to submit revised project plans that eliminate any Biden-era climate mandates and Diversity, Equity, Inclusion, and Accessibility mandates embedded in previous proposals to receive the previously obligated funds. 
Andy Olsen, a senior policy advocate with Environmental Law and Policy Center, said the requirement means farmers and rural small businesses have to “jump through more hoops” at a time when they are “already struggling with high costs and uncertainty.” 
“This isn’t cutting red tape; it’s adding more,” Olsen said in a statement. “The USDA claims to deliver on commitments but these new rules could result in awarded grants being permanently frozen.”
The stated goals of the president’s executive order include revising, suspending or rescinding programs that are “unduly burdensome” on oil, natural gas, coal, hydropower, biofuels, critical mineral, and nuclear energy resources. 
Solar energy is not mentioned in the order.
“The (Inflation Reduction Act) was marketed as a cure-all but delivered more bureaucracy than benefits for rural families,” said Rollins in the press release. “This course correction puts those investments back to work to support President Trump’s vision for energy independence and sets rural America on a path to lasting prosperity.”
Olsen said the farmers and rural businesses already made investments into renewable energy upgrades after entering into agreements with USDA “in good faith.” 
“Farmers and rural small businesses want USDA to honor the commitments it already made,” Olsen said.

Nico Rios, R-Williston, speaks in favor of a resolution that would make public officials mandatory reporters of child abuse at an April 3, 2025, hearing. (Mary Steurer/North Dakota Monitor)A House committee on Thursday advanced a resolution that advises the 2027 Legislature to make lawmakers mandatory reporters of child abuse.
The proposal is sponsored by Rep. Nico Rios, R-Williston, and was drafted by the North Dakota Young Republicans. 
Rios said the organization is bringing the proposal, House Concurrent Resolution 3037, in light of news surrounding former Republican Sen. Ray Holmberg’s prison sentence.
A federal judge last week sentenced Holmberg to 10 years in prison after the former senator pleaded guilty to traveling abroad with the intent to have commercial sex with minors. Holmberg served in the state Legislature for more than four decades and held the powerful position of Senate Appropriations Committee chair.

Rios said the Young Republicans were particularly struck by a sentencing memo filed by a federal prosecutor last month that alleged Holmberg had a pattern of exploiting boys and young men. Mark Friese, Holmberg’s defense attorney, denied many of the allegations in the memo and said there’s no evidence Holmberg had sex with minors.
Rios said that he gets questions from constituents asking whether other public officials in state government knew about Holmberg’s conduct but stayed quiet.
“That is why we need mandatory reporting, we should be held to a higher standard,” Rios told the House Political Subdivisions Committee on Thursday morning.
Current mandatory reporters of child abuse include medical professionals, social workers, law enforcement and teachers, according to the North Dakota Department of Health and Human Services website.
The resolution also urges lawmakers to seek additional ways for the state to root out crimes against children by public officials, including by establishing new penalties.
The North Dakota Young Republicans suggest that the Legislature consider studying the issue during the upcoming interim session.
“We believe this study can begin to answer the question so many in our state are asking: How did this happen, and more importantly, how can we prevent it from ever happening again?” Derek Turbide, national committeeman for the North Dakota Young Republicans, said in testimony in support of the proposal.
The proposal originally contained verses from the Bible, which committee members voted to remove.
Some lawmakers also expressed concerns that the resolution ignores systems the state already has in place to combat child exploitation and neglect.
“I would support the study to make legislators mandatory reporters, but I think the rest is unnecessary,” said Rep. Jonathan Warrey, R-Casselton.
The committee gave the resolution a do-pass recommendation. The proposal is headed to the House floor for a vote.

The bill has moved to the House of Delegates for consideration. (Will Price | West Virginia Legislative Photography)The freedom to make your own choices is part of being an American. West Virginians take this seriously. We believe in individual freedoms and self-reliance. It’s baked into our state motto: Mountaineers are always free. 
In practice, freedom in our state doesn’t apply to everyone. For years, the leaders in our state government have sent a clear message: Some Mountaineers are free — they have the freedom to live their lives the way they see fit. Others have to play by our rules.
If you have decided to have an abortion, you can’t do that here. If you have decided to help your kid get the health care they need to be themselves, you can’t do that here, either. And with persistently high poverty, falling investments in public education, and a crisis in affordable child care, too many Mountaineers are trapped in generational hardship, working multiple jobs to scrape by.
Every year, our Legislature gets just eight weeks to address the concerns of hardworking West Virginians. But too often, these sessions are dominated by political agendas that create more problems than solutions for our most vulnerable, and just as often, any attempt to resolve structural challenges to our communities is pushed to the side by culture wars that just cause more harm. 
A clear example of these twisted priorities is abortion. Abortion is completely banned for nearly every person who lives in West Virginia. The Legislature made sure of that by enacting a near-total ban three years ago. And yet lawmakers continue to attack this care, advancing a bill this year that targets out-of-state providers of abortion care by threatening them with a prison sentence.
They’ve also kept up their attacks on gender-affirming health care. This year, lawmakers are working to eliminate an essential, life-saving mental health exception to the current ban on this care — an exception used by only a handful of young people who live here.
The thing is, these politicians are counting on us to sit on the sidelines. They would prefer that their constituents stay home and let them make all the decisions, no matter the cost. And if we let them get away with that, then we have truly lost our way as Mountaineers — as people who fight for our right to live without the government telling us what we can and cannot do. 
New bills are introduced week by week that seek to strip us of what little reproductive rights remain, and if we allow our lawmakers to act unchecked, they will just continue to take them from us and ignore the real issues that affect us. Our resistance is essential. 
That’s why, this Friday, April 4, Planned Parenthood South Atlantic is hosting a Reproductive Resistance Advocacy Day at the state legislature to provide Mountaineers from across the state an opportunity to show up, speak their mind, learn more about the state of their rights, and find community amongst life-minded advocates in this fight for accessible reproductive care. 
I’m a lifelong West Virginian and proud to be. I cherish my neighbors, my community, and, regardless of our differences, all of my fellow Mountaineers. We take care of one another. But it’s time we hold our lawmakers to that same principle and apply that care to our reproductive health as well. We can’t afford inaction or ignorance — our futures depend on it.",https://westvirginiawatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/SB-299-20250306.jpg,,,2025-04-03 15:10:22.316581

[&#8230;],"University of Kansas students protest April 2, 2025, in response to the elimination of gender-inclusive housing assignments for the fall semester. (Maya Smith for Kansas Reflector)LAWRENCE — The University of Kansas Housing fired scholarship hall proctor Anthony Alvarez after he spoke to the media and refused to intervene in protests against the elimination of gender-inclusive housing.
Students and residents of Grace Pearson Scholarship Hall launched a new protest Wednesday in front of Strong Hall to stand in solidarity with Alvarez.
Alvarez expressed little regret for participating in actions that led to his termination even though he can no longer live in the hall. He intends to keep protesting KU Housing’s decision.
“I can’t live in the place where I foster community,” he said. “I didn’t do this for the money. I did this for my community. It is very, very hurtful. But I am thankful for the amount of support I have received.”
KU Housing did not respond to email or phone calls seeking comment.
Alvarez was put on probation March 13 after a meeting with housing staff. In a letter obtained by Kansas Reflector, Emily Chellgren, KU Housing assistant director, said he violated policy by speaking to news media instead of forwarding the request to his supervisor “despite knowing job expectations prohibited (him) from doing so.”
Kansas Reflector interviewed Alvarez for a March 4 story about students protesting the decision to eliminate gender-inclusive housing.
Alvarez was terminated March 14 after staff were made aware via security footage that he helped residents hang a banner outside of Grace Pearson rather than addressing the situation with residents and filing an incident report. His termination letter, also obtained by Kansas Reflector, noted he was already on probation for speaking with a reporter.
“I think it’s a bad sign that for infractions as little as this, you could get fired and kicked out and very quickly find yourself in a position where you have to find a place to live,” Alvarez said. “This makes it so that these undergrad students really feel the necessity to enforce policy that they may consider to be unjust or discriminatory.”
According to an article published by the University Daily Kansan, eight residents and proctors of Grace Pearson spoke to the press under anonymity. No other proctors have been put on probation.
First Amendment lawyer Max Kautsch said because there’s no evidence of other proctors being put on probation for speaking to the press, KU Housing didn’t violate Alvarez’ free speech rights. But Kautsch said the university should be cautious of how it handles the situation going forward.
“The First Amendment’s been implicated, but to the extent there’s a violation, the facts right now don’t necessarily lend itself to that,” Kautsch said. “It’s the kind of thing if you’re the university, you got be conscious of.”
The protest Wednesday brought both Grace Pearson residents and other KU students together to protest in front of Strong Hall for nearly five hours. For student Leah Johnson, protecting the Grace Pearson community is key to the trans community at KU.
“As a trans person myself, gender-inclusive assignments are extremely important to me,” Johnson said. “Removing this is clearly a targeted action against trans communities that I will not stand for.”
Along with two protests, residents have taken to using sticky notes on their windows, creating messages like “GP for GIA” and “Keep GP Safe.” Banners hung in the hall by residents continue to be taken down by staff, seen in videos posted by residents.
“I’m choosing to protest because I think that it is a terrible decision to restrict gender inclusive assignments and to try to enforce gendered bathrooms,” said Michael Wieber, hall president. “I think it’s downright fascist, the idea of only certain people can use a bathroom, or we need to check your gender.”
According to the KU Housing handbook, decorations on windows should “generally be directed to the interior of the room.” Many residents with sticky notes in their windows were emailed this week by Housing notifying them they would be required to attend university conduct meetings in the next week.
Some students plan to continue protests and make their voices heard. Unlike scholarship hall proctors, residents including Wieber do not have restrictions on speaking to the press.
“We’re trying to get anything from KU,” Wieber said. “It’s effectively been two months where we’ve gotten radio silence from KU housing. It’s very clear that Grace Pearson doesn’t like the messages.”",https://kansasreflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/IMG_2276-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-04-03 15:10:22.316581

It’s one of several pieces of legislation in the House this session that would allow for more litigation — something Insurance and Banking Committee member Rep. Mike Caruso noted Thursday while arguing against HB 1181. He was one of two “no” votes on the bill, which now heads to the House Judiciary Committee, its last stop before a full House vote.
“This feels good for the trial attorneys, and maybe we should call this the ‘Insurance and Trial Attorneys Subcommittee’ because I feel like we’re doing a lot just for the benefit of trial attorneys. And by doing that, I think we’re doing wrong for Floridians,” said Caruso, whose hawkish position on immigration has already put him at odds with House Speaker Daniel Perez, an attorney.
The Senate companion (SB 1256) has been referred to three committees: Banking and Insurance; Agriculture, Environment, and General Government Appropriations; and Rules. The bill hasn’t been heard by any of them.

Florida drivers now are required to carry $10,000 in PIP (for personal injury protection) coverage plus $10,000 in property damage liability insurance. Those are minimum requirements, and drivers can purchase additional coverage. According to the Department of Highway Safety and Motor Vehicles, just under 6% of drivers on Florida roads were uninsured as of February.










The chiropractors want you to protect them. They just told you that. God bless them. I love chiropractors. The hospitals want you to protect them. The doctors want you to protect them.  And funny, the insurance companies want you to protect them, too. But I ain't here to protect any of them, and neither are you. We're here to make sure that it's a fair and equitable moment in Florida when you put your key in your car and drive and somebody hurts you.


– Rep. Danny Alvarez

HB 1181 would eliminate the state’s no-fault law and drop the PIP mandate. Additionally, the bill would increase the minimum bodily injury liability coverage limits from $10,000 per person and $20,000 per incident to $25,000 per person and $50,000 per incident.
Opposition
Representatives of the insurance industry, health care sector, and business interests testified against the bill, arguing the new insurance would cost more and could cause lower-income drivers to drop their coverage and increase the number of uninsured motorists on the road.
Mark Delegal represents State Farm, the largest auto insurer in the state, as well as the Safety Net Hospital Alliance of Florida, which represents some of the largest public hospitals and teaching institutions.
He testified that legislation passed in 2023 eliminating one-way attorney fees in coverage disputes and cracking down on bad faith lawsuits are beginning to take hold in the auto insurance market. Rates, he testified, are coming down as those changes take effect.
Also representing the hospitals, Delegal said scrapping the no-fault means drivers will go to court to prove who’s to blame for auto accidents and that takes time.
“Hospitals are going to see delayed payment and this is not good,” he said.
It was a theme echoed by Toni Large, who represents emergency room physicians and orthopaedic surgeons.
Large said that ER physicians bill the care they provide on a level of one through five, with the latter being trauma patients. 
Most care stemming from automobile accidents provided by her clients is a level three. While the PIP reimbursement for her physicians providing level 3 care is $1,500 she said, the payments come quickly.
“It really impacts physicians when they are waiting two years for payments,” she said.
Double paying?
Motorcyclists from across the state for the second time in two weeks trekked to Tallahassee to show support for PIP repeal because they are not eligible for the coverage. The Florida Justice Association, which represents trial attorneys, also spoke out in support of repeal, citing the high costs for paltry coverage.
Vero Beach attorney and FJA member Dane Ullian argued that PIP, initially passed 50 years ago and meant to provide health care for drivers involved in car accidents, is redundant now that an estimated 90% of residents have some form of health insurance.
Eliminating the mandate to buy the coverage means they won’t be paying double the costs of health insurance, he said.
“One of the reasons [auto] rates are so high is we have a vestigial tail of an antiquated insurance system from 50 years ago, the redundant PIP no-fault system which requires every single driver in the state of Florida to buy a state-regulated health insurance plan for $10,000 of coverage when almost 90% of Floridians already have health insurance,” Ullian said. 
“So, right now we’re forcing 90% of Florida drivers to buy a health plan they don’t want to fund coverage for the other 10% of Florida drivers to get a layer of coverage that they don’t need,” he said.
Bill sponsor Rep. Danny Alvarez said HB 1181 is about improving protections for Florida drivers and not about any particular industry. He noted that PIP laws have been changed at least five times since initially being passed — each time with the promise that the changes will reduce costs and ferret out fraud in the system. Savings have not come, he said, and the system does not make the driver whole.
“The chiropractors want you to protect them. They just told you that. God bless them. I love chiropractors. The hospitals want you to protect them. The doctors want you to protect them. And, funny, the insurance companies want you to protect them, too,” Alvarez said.
“But I ain’t here to protect any of them, and neither are you. We’re here to make sure that it’s a fair and equitable moment in Florida when you put your key in your car and drive and somebody hurts you,” he added.

But the House, which is evenly split between Republicans and Democrats, has agreed to spend up to $700 million on infrastructure projects — around half of the Senate DFL target.
DFL House Leader Melissa Hortman said Monday the House target could change in negotiations with the Senate and governor. 
Known around the Capitol as a “bonding bill,” the Legislature typically funds public works projects with borrowed money in even years; the Constitution requires a 60% supermajority for passage, which means the bill requires robust bipartisan support. Bonding bills raise money for infrastructure projects by directing state agencies to sell off bonds; the state then pays back the bond holders over time, with interest. 
“At a time when the federal government is slashing funds for community projects, it’s more important than ever that state lawmakers support these shovel-ready projects,” said Sen. Sandy Pappas, DFL-St. Paul, who chairs the Senate Capital Investment committee. 
There’s another reason lawmakers may feel more pressure to pass a bonding bill immediately: Congressional Republicans are considering changes to tax law that would cause interest rates on bonds to rise significantly, making infrastructure projects more expensive to finance.
Historically, the Minnesota Legislature passed a budget in odd-numbered years and a bonding bill in even-numbered years, but lawmakers failed to reach an agreement on a bonding bill in 2024. 
The DFL-controlled Legislature passed a $2.6 billion infrastructure package in the 2023 session, including $1.5 billion in bonds, following three legislative sessions without an infrastructure deal.
Pappas said the inconsistency in passing bonding bills has created a backlog in the list of projects; water and sewer plants across the state are aging out at the same time, she said. 
Labor unions back the bonding bill because it would create new jobs for blue collar workers; cities want the bonding bill to pass because they rely on state funds to complete local projects.",https://minnesotareformer.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/infrastructure-1024x698-1.jpg,,,2025-04-03 14:07:15.589359

(Michael Achterling/North Dakota Monitor)The rehabilitation of female inmates in North Dakota took a large step forward Wednesday as state officials celebrated the groundbreaking of the first prison in state history designed to house women.
The new Heart River Correctional Center in Mandan will be more than 191,500 square feet and includes space for 304 beds. The project is expected to cost $166.8 million and be complete in fall of 2027.
Gov. Kelly Armstong and other state officials joined Colby Braun, director of the North Dakota Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation, and Warden Connie Hackman Rivinius for an event that included women who are in custody.
“Today, we take another step toward a justice system that not only ensures public safety, but also provides opportunities for rehabilitation and second chances,” Hackman Rivinius said. “This project represents more than just walls and infrastructure. It symbolizes the commitment to dignity, safety and the possibility of change.”
In 2021, the department shifted some inmates from the primary women’s prison in New England to the Heart River campus in Mandan. More than 50 women now occupy two residence cottages at the site, which also houses a separate juvenile detention center. 
The new facility will give female inmates access to more employment and educational services, Braun said.
“It’s about making sure they are supported to leave so they don’t come back again,” Braun said. “This is that beginning stage.”

Lucila Madrigal, one of the women at Heart River, said having staff take an interest in her has made her a better person.
“It makes me want to follow the example they lead, strive to be the best version of myself, be a working member of society and hopefully be a role model for others like me one day,” Madrigal said.
The new women’s prison has been the subject of discussion and division among lawmakers during the legislative session. A bill that would allow the department to begin developing policies for female inmates to have their newborn babies live with them for up to 18 months passed the Senate on a 28-18 vote and the House on a 48-42 vote. 
Armstrong announced Wednesday he signed that bill, leading to cheers from the female inmates of Heart River Correctional Center in attendance. 
“Being tough on crime doesn’t work,” he said. Armstrong added holding serious offenders accountable is important, but funding for rehabilitation and addressing overcrowding is also a priority.
He said it is the state’s solemn responsibility to give the best care and rehabilitation possible to inmates under their care so they can be better citizens once they leave.
“A good criminal justice system holds people accountable, but it gives them grace and it gives them hope,” said Armstrong, a former criminal defense attorney. “We don’t criminalize people. We criminalize conduct and that is why lady justice is blind. That is why facilities like this matter.”
Braun said many inmates have been through traumatic events, battle addiction issues or may deal with mental health concerns, which is why he believes the prison needs to be a place of restoration.
“It’s about the vocational piece. It’s about learning those skills and it’s all the services around,” Braun said. “Really, this is so much more than just a bed.”
He added the road to the new women’s prison has taken about 40 years, beginning with a single female unit at the State Penitentiary in the 1980s. Prior to that unit, North Dakota contracted with other states to house female inmates.
Later women were housed on a floor of the James River Correctional Center in Jamestown. Lawmakers decided in the 2003 session that female prisoners needed a dedicated facility, which led to the department renovating the former St. Mary’s Catholic School in New England.
“We just turned some doors into locked prison doors and beyond that it was really just using that exact same foundation that was laid out for kids,” said Braun, who was the warden in New England from 2004 to 2010.
The New England facility is still the primary intake point for female inmates. After the new complex opens, the site may shift its focus more toward rehabilitation and minimum security beds, Braun said.
During the 2023 legislative session, lawmakers approved $131.2 million for the Heart River Correctional Center. The remaining $35.6 million is under consideration by the House Appropriations Committee after passing the Senate unanimously in February.
Rep. Jon Nelson, R-Rugby, said female inmates needed to be closer to services that they couldn’t get in rural southwestern North Dakota. The women will be able to use some of the same services that men receive at the State Penitentiary, which lawmakers hope will lead to better outcomes and lower recidivism, he said.
“New England did the job that it was intended to do,” Nelson said. “Treatment is such a big part of the rehabilitation process and finding treatment personnel in that region is difficult.”

(Screenshot from NCGA video feed)The state pension system has a $16 billion deficit, state Treasurer Brad Briner told a legislative committee Thursday morning, and the department’s investment division needs a new strategic direction. 
Briner used his appearance before the House Oversight Committee to talk up his proposal for changing how investment decisions are made. 
He also faced pointed questions from Democrats on the committee about potential crypto investments. 
A bill moving through the state House, one backed by House Speaker Destin Hall, would allow the Treasurer’s office to invest in Bitcoin.
Right now, the state Treasurer makes all the investment decisions. The office has investment advisory boards, but the Treasurer doesn’t have to listen to them. 
Briner wants the state to create a board, called the Investment Authority, that would make investment decisions. His proposal is in House Bill 506 and its Senate twin, Senate Bill 709. The Treasurer would sit on the board with appointees from the House Speaker, the Senate leader, the Governor and the Treasurer. Members would have a minimum of 10 years’ experience in investment management. 
Coincidentally, Briner’s committee appearance coincided with a sharp drop in stock market indexes triggered by President Donald Trump’s tariffs. 
“Today is going to be a very interesting day in U.S. capital markets history,” he said. “The temptation for everyone is to do something, anything,” Briner said. “The right answer is probably going to be to wait.”
For a political office holder, the temptation is greater, he said. Having an investment board would be a guard against that temptation and still provide political accountability, he said. 
North Carolina is one of three states where one person is responsible for investment decisions, he said. 
“I think more heads are better than one when it comes to having a disciplined, long-term investment strategy,” he said. “I think having this kind of concentrated power in a single individual, elected or otherwise, doesn’t really make sense.”
Former Treasurer Dale Folwell had an unorthodox approach to investing that was out of step with other large public pension funds, NC Newsline has reported. The pension fund held a far greater percentage of its money in cash than other public pension plans, which was a drag on returns.
Pension investments have fallen short of the 6.5% rate of return, Briner said, and the state pension fund ranks 49th or 50th in returns. 
With a sole fiduciary, “it is easy to be overly conservative in that model, and hard to be appropriately risky in that model, because you get all of the blame, and you get none of the credit. And I understand from a human emotion perspective why you’d end up where we are, and that’s not a good place.”
Democrats on the committee asked repeated questions about investments in crypto currency. Rep. Allison Dahle (D-Wake) said constituents are wondering about it. 
Briner said Bitcoin is “the best method to bet against the value of the U.S. dollar” but it’s also extremely volatile. 
“There probably is a role for them over time in a very modest proportion,” he said.",https://ncnewsline.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Screen-Shot-2025-04-03-at-10.03.02-AM-1024x545.png,,,2025-04-03 14:07:15.589359

(Matthew Perschall for Louisiana Illuminator)The LSU athletic department is not subject to budget belt-tightening measures the university announced for all departments last week amid an uncertain fiscal outlook, a school spokesman said. 
LSU President William Tate announced last week the university would withhold 2% of each department’s budget, with 75% of that money going to a fund to support academic and research initiatives. This won’t apply to the athletic department , LSU spokesman Todd Woodward said in a statement to the Illuminator and Tiger Rag, because it is considered an auxiliary to the university. 
During difficult budget times for the university in the past, LSU’s athletic department has transferred money to the university. After Gov. Bobby Jindal slashed the state budget, the athletic department began making annual transfers. 
The school received tens of millions of dollars from its sports programs from 2012-19, when athletic director Scott Woodward ended the practice shortly after he took the job. 
“It’s something that’s very dangerous, when universities rely on recurring money, especially from an auxiliary like the athletic department,” Woodward told Tiger Rag in 2019. “So no, I think, while I will always support the university in some form or fashion, we can not sustain what we’re currently doing.”
As the rest of the university gets ready for cutbacks, Todd Woodward — no relation to the athletic director — said the university is not asking for help from athletics. 
Universities, particularly research institutions such as LSU, are bracing for tough times as the Trump administration makes dramatic reductions to agencies that fund research on college campuses and at their affiliated medical schools and research institutions. Many of these cuts are on pause, pending the outcome of litigation. 
LSU spent $488 million on research in fiscal year 2023, the most recent period for which data is available. Most of that money came from federal grants. 
LSU could lose $12 million if Trump’s proposed cut to indirect cost reimbursements for National Institutes of Health grants are allowed to go into effect, and it would lose tens of millions more if other agencies followed suit.

Even if the athletic department was asked for help, its currently strained fiscal position could make that difficult. 
LSU’s sports programs collectively operated at a deficit in fiscal year 2024, according to a Louisiana Legislative Auditor’s report. It’s the third year in a row the athletic department finished the business year in the red.
The department is currently in a hiring freeze because of its budget constraints. 
“I would certainly hope that moving forward, if they do have surplus in their budget, that they would want to support the academic side of campus as they have in the past,” LSU Faculty Senate President Dan Tirone said in an interview. 
“I think that athletics has some questions about their own financial status at the moment, given some of the changes with the NCAA and some of the obligations they may be taking on,” he added. 
College athletic departments anticipate increased expenses as they prepare to start sharing revenue with student athletes. Starting next fiscal year, LSU has to find approximately $20 million more to share with its athletes. 
LSU athletics spokesman Zach Greenwell declined to make an athletics official available to discuss the department’s budget. 
Most major athletic programs are expected to pay the full amount allowed under a settlement in the federal case, House v. NCAA, in which former college athletes sued the athletic association over rules that prevented them from profiting on their names, images and likenesses (NIL). 
The proposed settlement, which is expected to be finalized in the coming weeks, will require schools to share athletic revenue of up to $22 million. It also requires the NCAA to provide back pay to former athletes who competed before it allowed NIL payments.
This increase in expenditures for major programs such as LSU could mean fewer handouts to struggling universities, sports administration scholars say. 
“Anytime a department – athletics or otherwise – is helping out the broader university, it’s usually because of some sort of marginal budget,” said Adam Cook, a sports administration lecturer at Northwestern University. 
Steven Rackley, a sport management professor at Rice University and a longtime former athletic director, said in an interview the cost of revenue sharing hitting at the same time as proposed federal funding cuts for higher education will force difficult decisions. 
“Presidents and board of trustees, whoever it may be, are going to have to decide how much is athletics worth as opposed to the worth of doing research in academia on campus, and that’s going to be just a tough discussion that those people are going to have to have,” Rackley said. 
The athletic department not pitching in during a difficult budget time could increase the chronic tension between faculty and athletics, which exists at nearly every university, Rackley said. 
“Those are the kind of things that make things challenging, where people look at athletics as being special, or they don’t have to do their part,” he said. “If athletics said, ‘Yeah, we were going to jump in here and do our part,’ I think that would really alleviate some of that [tension] and help bring some people back to supporting athletics.” 
Some universities could be looking to institutional support or student athletic fees to help fill budget gaps. 
LSU currently does not have a student fee supporting athletics, although other Southeastern Conference schools do, including Auburn, Georgia and Ole Miss. Their athletic departments bring in millions from these fees, according to data from the Knight-Newhouse College Athletics Database. With an annual collection of almost $7 million, Auburn brings in the most in the SEC in student fees.  
Seeking a student fee for athletics at LSU would come with its own complications. The university has increased tuition for certain high-cost programs, and state lawmakers are considering legislation that could decrease how much state financial aid LSU students receive.

Kentucky Public Health Commissioner Dr. Steven Stack will succeed him as CHFS secretary. 
The sprawling cabinet has a broad range of health and social services duties, from protecting children and vulnerable adults to administering the Medicaid program and inspecting nursing homes. It oversees billions of dollars in state and federal spending.
Speaking of the two men, Beshear said “their level of service goes beyond mere professionalism.” He praised them for “living out their values at the highest level, selflessly serving all of our neighbors.” 
Both Stack and Friedlander were instrumental in guiding Kentucky through the COVID-19 pandemic and pushing back against vaccine misinformation. 
“It has been an honor to serve,” Friedlander said during Beshear’s weekly press conference. 
He also said his job over the last few years would have been more difficult “if we didn’t have a governor that actually believed in science.” 
Stack echoed that, thanking Beshear for supporting “me in being able to be factual and straight with the people of Kentucky.” 
“It feels now that we’re entering a third act with all sorts of challenges coming from the federal government,” Stack said. “Public health and health and family services is essential to ensuring that we have healthier people and healthier communities. If we fail to invest in these services and supports to ensure that all of us have the opportunity to thrive, we will all be worse off for it.” 
Beshear said the choice of Stack’s replacement will be “collaborative.” 
Friedlander has been in his current role since 2020, though he’s worked in the cabinet for about four decades. He formerly worked as chief resiliency officer for the Louisville government.

Legislative Bill 22, from State Sen. George Dungan of Lincoln, passed 47-0. It expands on Dungan’s “Nebraska Prenatal Plus Program” in 2024 that offers services to Medicaid-eligible mothers to help prevent low birth weights, preterm births and adverse birth outcomes. Dungan said the bill represents “another step forward in ensuring that we have healthy moms and healthy babies in Nebraska.”
“This program will give an opportunity, do those who want it, to have nurse visiting to ensure postpartum care and reduce adverse birth outcomes all across the state,” Dungan said. “People should have access to this care no matter their background or where they live in the state.”
  State Sen. George Dungan of Lincoln. July 29, 2024. (Zach Wendling/Nebraska Examiner)
Dungan’s 2025 legislation, which heads to Gov. Jim Pillen, would expand care to include voluntary targeted case management for evidence-based nurse home visitation services, similar to the Family Connects program in Lincoln and Lancaster County and now being piloted in Omaha.
The goal is to expand the program statewide, deploying a nurse to the homes of eligible postpartum mothers and children six months of age or younger for one-on-one services.
Families would be allowed to decline home visitation services at any time. 
Defining ‘home visitations’
LB 22 also passed with LB 104 from State Sen. Jane Raybould of Lincoln, which helps define home visitations and what they cover.
LB 104 lays the groundwork for a potentially more expansive visitation program in the future, primarily in the homes of families with one or more children, who are 5 years old or younger, or expecting parents.
Raybould’s language requires the Nebraska Department of Health and Human Services to only fund a program if it includes periodic home visits meant to improve the health, well-being and self-sufficiency of parents and their children. Such a program could include nurses, social workers or other early childhood and health professionals.

The approved home visitation program would need to accomplish at least one of the following:

Improve maternal, infant or child health outcomes, including reducing preterm births.
Promote positive parenting practices.
Build healthy parent and child relationships.
Enhance social and emotional development.
Support cognitive development.
Improve the health and well-being of the family.
Empower families toward economic self-sufficiency.
Reduce child maltreatment and injury.
Increase school readiness.

To receive state or federal funding, programs must be founded on a clear and consistent methodology, associated with or certified by a credible organization, have comprehensive standards to ensure high quality and continuous services and employ well-trained and culturally competent staff, among others.
DHHS would be required to submit three related annual reports, beginning Feb. 15, 2026.
“They give confidence to a lot of new parents and they have evidence-based support showing that they do make a difference in helping families get adjusted to being new parents an being the best parents that you can possibly be,” Raybould, a former member of the Lincoln City Council and Lancaster Board of Commissioners, said.
340B Contract Pharmacy Protection Act
LB 168, from State Sen. Brian Hardin of Gering, also passed 42-5 on Thursday. It would prohibit 340B Program drug manufacturers from interfering with or denying sales of such drugs to hospitals, clinics or pharmacies that manufacturers contract with. The federal program requires drug manufacturers to provide discounts to eligible entities caring for uninsured or low-income patients in exchange for their participation in Medicaid and Medicare. No federal or state tax dollars are used for the program.
  State Sen. Brian Hardin of Gering. Jan. 9, 2025. (Zach Wendling/Nebraska Examiner)
Hardin’s bill, and others like it in other states, was criticized by a political action committee backed by Trump adviser Elon Musk. Republican lawmakers were criticized as “undermining Trump” and funding “gender transitions for kids, abortion procedures and health care for illegals.” 
Hardin, who chairs the Legislature’s Health and Human Services Committee, has said the claims have no truth. Nebraska lawmakers prohibited gender transition surgeries for minors, restricted gender transition medications and limited abortion procedures in 2023, with Hardin’s approval.
Hardin thanked his fellow senators for valuing the “life-saving work” from the 58 hospitals in the state that benefit from the congressional program, which he said is “paid for by Big Pharma.”
“Hospitals from Kimball to UNMC [the University of Nebraska Medical Center] greatly benefit from this program!” Hardin said in a text. “Good for Nebraska!!”
Other passed legislation
Among other bills passed Thursday:

LB 7, from State Sen. Barry DeKay of Niobrara, would clarify that Native American tribes are not foreign governments for purposes of the Foreign-Owned Real-Estate National Security Act. DeKay passed the law in 2024, at Pillen’s request, to prohibit foreign adversaries from purchasing land in the state. Approved 47-0.


LB 41, from State Sen. Merv Riepe of Ralston, would expand blood testing for pregnant women to check for syphilis from one screening during the first trimester to also include testing in the third trimester and at birth. Testing would be voluntary. Approved 47-0.


LB 105, from State Sen. Jana Hughes of Seward, would allow public power districts to split voting precincts when crafting subdivisions, without regard to population, “if in the opinion of the Power Review Board the district boundaries do not prejudice the interests of electric consumers.” District lines must currently follow precinct or county lines or contain substantially equal populations, meaning some voters are excluded from their local power district. Approved 46-1.


LB 143, from State Sen. Victor Rountree of Bellevue, would require that military families be able to get preliminary or advanced enrollment for their children regardless if they have an individualized education program, individualized family service plan or Section 504 special accommodations, or receive special education. Approved 47-0.


LB 195, from State Sen. Glen Meyer of Pender, would provide health professionals immunity for the prescription, administration or dispensing of any generic opioid overdose reversal medications, not just Naloxone. Approved 47-0.


LB 248, from State Sen. Rita Sanders of Bellevue, would exempt child care programs on a military base or federal property or a facility licensed by a branch of the U.S. Department of Defense or U.S. Coast Guard from needing to be separately licensed in Nebraska. Approved 47-0.


LB 312, from State Sen. Paul Strommen of Sidney, would allow nurse anesthetists to qualify for student loans or student loan repayment under the Rural Health Systems and Professional Incentive Act. Approved 46-1.


LB 501, also by Meyer, would expand a state program that allows properties to be reassessed after they are destroyed (such as after a natural disaster) for property tax purposes to include all damages not caused by the owner. Property owners could apply for a reassessment if damage meets or exceeds 20% of the land’s assessed value and is before July 1 of the same year. The current law, from former State Sen. Steve Erdman of Bayard, passed in 2019. Approved 47-0.

(Getty Images)A strategic plan released last month made dozens of recommendations for strengthening the state’s food system.
It painted a challenging picture for New Hampshire’s estimated 4,000 farms, which “rarely operate in a way that provides enough income for the farm family,” the plan said. And the pressures are growing, with agriculture sales decreasing 12.6% from 2017 to 2022, it said.
“The data demonstrates that we need to adjust our collective work to create a stronger local food system by centering the financial viability of farming, fishing, and food production in New Hampshire,” the plan reads.
The plan was created by the NH Food Alliance, a network based out of the University of New Hampshire Sustainability Institute that worked in partnership with the Department of Agriculture, Markets, and Food and others. It was supported by funding from the U.S. Department of Agriculture’s Resilient Food Systems Infrastructure Program, as well as the New Hampshire Charitable Foundation.
While the plan noted that different types of producers face different problems, it also pointed out common struggles, like the loss of 80% of the state’s farmland over the past 60 years, New Hampshire’s “shortage of affordable housing,” increased environmental pressures from climate change, and more.
At the same time, the plan pitched the benefits and opportunities of looking local when it comes to agriculture: “regional food security, economic stability for farmers, fishermen, and food producers, regional economic growth, protected open spaces, a stable food supply, climate resilience, and improved public health and nutrition.”
The plan engaged 118 subject matter experts in developing 27 briefs across a range of topics including agritourism, dairy, fruits and vegetables, consumer education, disaster relief, farmland conservation, and more. 
In the end, the plan issued 143 recommendations tied to each of the briefs. For the state’s “rapidly” dwindling dairy farms, for instance, it called for measures like creating an association to advocate for the state’s dairy industry, bolstering workforce development, and offering more grant support.
The plan was spurred by the NH Food Alliance’s participation in the New England Food System Planners Partnership, which aims for New Englanders to consume 30% regional food products by 2030, according to a news release from UNH. An analysis from the partnership found that only 3.2% of Granite Staters’ spending on food, beverages, and alcohol in 2022 went to regional sources.",https://newhampshirebulletin.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/dairyfarms-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-04-03 14:07:15.589359

(Governor's office photo by Dana DiFilippo)Former Englewood Cliffs Mayor Mario Kranjac will be on June’s GOP primary ballot despite legal claims by one of his rivals that Kranjac did not file enough signatures from eligible voters to stay in the race, Secretary of State Tahesha Way said Thursday.
Way, who is also lieutenant governor, agreed with an administrative law judge who said Wednesday that Kranjac collected enough signatures to qualify for the ballot. Kranjac in a statement attacked the attempt to boot him from the race as equivalent to Democrats’ efforts to keep Donald Trump from running for reelection last year.
“I never thought ‘Republicans’ would try to use the same left-wing lawfare tactics popularized by Adam Schiff on me and my supporters in this gubernatorial primary,” Kranjac said in a statement.
Schiff is an anti-Trump U.S. senator from California.
Way had until noon Thursday to certify candidates for June’s primary
The effort to keep Kranjac out of June’s primary was launched by the campaign for Republican Bill Spadea, a former New Jersey 101.5 host who is also seeking to become our next governor. The primary is June 10 (six Democrats are vying for their party’s nomination).
Candidates for governor must submit petitions with signatures from 2,500 registered voters. Spadea’s team said Kranjac’s signatures included some from voters who are not Republicans and that some of the people who circulated the petitions from Kranjac’s campaign should have been registered as Republicans at the time (they were unaffiliated and later registered with the GOP).
During marathon sessions Monday and Tuesday before a judge, hundreds of Kranjac’s signatures were deemed ineligible. Way said after this process, about 2,600 valid signatures remained.
Spadea and Kranjac are both seeking the GOP nod for governor by labeling themselves as the most pro-Trump candidate. Kranjac often touts the Star-Ledger’s coverage of him as the “Trumpy mayor” of Englewood Cliffs, while Spadea long championed Trump’s policies while he hosted his morning radio show.
In his statement, Kranjac took direct aim at Spadea, calling his case “fake and fraudulent.”
“Other opponents should take notice: I’m in this race to win,” Kranjac said.
A spokesman for the Spadea campaign did not respond to requests for comment.
Burlington County contractor Justin Barbera, state Sen. Jon Bramnick, and former Assemblyman Jack Ciattarelli round out the Republican field.
Twenty-one Assembly candidates also saw their petitions challenged. Of those, seven were removed from the ballot and one had their case remanded to the Office of Administrative Law. The remaining 13 were deemed eligible for the ballot.

(Photo by Marcio Silva/ Getty Images)When the Boston Red Sox step onto the field Friday for their first game at Fenway Park this season, members of the Maine House of Representatives will likely be thinking of their friend and former colleague, the late Lois Galgay Reckitt. 
“Somewhere up there, hopefully she’s got a great seat for tomorrow’s home opener,” said Rep. James Thorne (R-Carmel).
Reckitt was a Red Sox fan from the day she was born, said Rep. Matthew Beck (D-South Portland), who was elected to fill the seat Reckitt held when she died in October 2023. She was 78. 
“Everyday I’m here I’m humbled by the knowledge that I’m occupying the seat once held by Lois Reckitt and I know that I will never be able to fully fill her shoes,” Beck said, adding that her generous spirit and forgiving nature was reflected in her ability to be his friend despite his allegiance to the New York Yankees. 
Thursday’s discussion, held on the floor of the Maine House of Representatives, was born out of a resolution from Rep. Rachel Henderson (R-Rumford) to honor Reckitt in celebration of the Red Sox home opener. Regardless of party or team affinity, representatives from across the state took the opportunity to share the ways Reckitt shaped their lives. 
The heartfelt speeches provided a break from what had been a rancorous few weeks in the Maine House. Just over a week ago, multiple Republicans took to the floor to share feelings of broken trust and division between them and their Democratic colleagues fueled by censure votes and contentious budget negotiations that led to a technical adjournment and opening of a special session.
Despite their diverging political views, Henderson said she and Reckitt — a progressive known for championing gender and LGBTQ rights — became kindred spirits in the short time they served in the Legislature together. Henderson described her as the epitome of intellectual integrity and a phenomenal storyteller. 
Reckitt was called a great mentor, a constant, a lion who modeled fairness and integrity. 
“Like baseball, Lois marked the time for all of us,” said Rep. Adam Lee (D-Auburn), who shared memories of serving on the Legislature’s Judiciary Committee with Reckitt.
During one of his early terms, Rep. Will Tuell (R-East Machias) said a colleague set a challenge to meet five new people every session. The impression was for those to be people outside of one’s caucus. This led to Tuell, a self-described introvert, often chatting with Reckitt over breakfast. 
He described them as friends, but political opposites. They found common ground with the Red Sox, evidenced by Reckitt leaving boxes at Tuell’s seat with bobbleheads of the players she thought he would like, an act he found touching and humbling.
Tuell also said it’s not lost on him that Reckitt was one of the few lawmakers who visited a correctional facility Down East to research legislation introduced about it. Though they didn’t often change each other’s minds when it came to policy, Tuell spoke of the civility and respect they shared. 
“We worked to find common ground when we could and when we couldn’t, life went on, and that’s how it should be in this chamber,” he said. 
Rep. Vicki Doudera (D-Camden) spoke of the regret she has that Reckitt never got to meet her husband, Ed, who died in December. But she also thanked Henderson for putting the resolution forward and evoking happy memories of Reckitt and her husband.
“I hope if there’s a place where kindred spirits align somewhere in the universe, that Lois and Ed are talking about the Green Monster, and the curse of the Bambino, and how that was broken in 2004, and Pesky’s Pole,” Doudera said.

(Getty Images)Several voting rights groups sent a “notice of violation” to the Indiana Secretary of State’s Office and the Indiana Election Division on Wednesday, alleging that a new state law violates the National Voter Registration Act. 
“U.S.-born citizens would not face the same barriers while naturalized citizens would be required to jump through additional hoops to register to vote,” said Julia Vaughn, the executive director of Common Cause Indiana in a Thursday release. “Indiana already struggles with low voter turnout — it doesn’t make sense to impose new barriers.”
The pertinent portion of House Enrolled Act 1264 from 2024 doesn’t go into effect until July 1. It requires the state’s National Voter Registration Act official — in this case, the co-directors of the state’s election division — to “compare the statewide voter registration system with the Bureau of Motor Vehicles list of temporary credentials …” 

Groups signing the letter include: Common Cause Indiana, the League of Women Voters of Indiana, Hoosier Asian American Power, the NAACP Indiana State Conference, the Chicago Lawyers’ Committee for Civil Rights, the National Lawyers’ Committee for Civil Rights Under Law and attorneys William R. Groth and Daniel Bowman of Bowman & Vlink, LLC.

That official “shall” notify the local county that “the registered voter may not be a citizen of the United States.” The law further dictates that the registered voter must provide proof of citizenship within 30 days of receiving a notice or the county will cancel that registration. 
“The reality is that non-citizens are not voting in our elections and the citizenship check provision of 2024’s HEA 1264 will be harmful for voter access,” said Ami Gandhi, with the Chicago Lawyers’ Committee for Civil Rights. 
“By relying on flawed data matching processes that use outdated BMV records, and requiring citizenship verification under tight deadlines, this law increases the risk of wrongful voter purges. This is a violation of the (NVRA) and creates unnecessary hurdles that only naturalized citizens — and no U.S.-born citizens — will have to endure to exercise their right to vote.” 
According to the Secretary of State’s Office, the NVRA had a three-pronged goal: increasing the number of registered eligible voters, protecting the voting process’ integrity and enhancing voter participation. 
But the voting rights groups said it was also meant to protect citizens from “discriminatory and unfair registration laws, particularly those that negatively impact eligible voters from historically marginalized communities.”
“Requiring proof of citizenship to register to vote disproportionately impacts communities of color,” said Sadie Harper-Scott, the president of NAACP Indiana State Conference. “Many eligible voters, including Black people and people of color, may not have access to the documents that are being required in HEA 1264. This will suppress voter participation, not protect democracy.”
Thursday’s press release concludes by saying that if the state fails to respond and correct violations within 90 days, the coalition “may” file a lawsuit.

(Brian Lyman/Alabama Reflector)The Alabama House of Representatives approved a $3.7 billion 2026 General Fund budget 95-3 on Thursday morning.
HB 186, sponsored by Rep. Rex Reynolds, R-Huntsville, is $347 million more than the current budget, about a 10% increase. Black Democrats criticized the budget for cutting appropriations for the Magic City Classic; Birmingham Civil Rights Museum and Jazz Hall of Fame. 
Rep. A.J. McCampbell, D-Linden, said the programs were part of diversity, equity and inclusion and needed to be funded.

“If we don’t bring all of the minds, all of the cultures and all of the people together to work on things that affect all of the people, then we develop things in silos,” McCampbell said.
Rep. Juandalynn Givan, D-Birmingham, said a senator held a luncheon at the Jazz Hall of fame last week and wondered what happened in a week to the support of the museum in Birmingham.
“A couple of days later, we find out that the small funds that they would be receiving would be cut,” she said.
The programs get a total of $2.2 million (0.06%) in the current budget. Reynolds told Givan that the programs would be funded through a Senate amendment. He said the budget was run through a computer program that cut one-time appropriations and that he would be willing to add funds back in for programs that needed it.
“When members came to me and asked me to reinsert those, we often did,” Reynolds said. “But nobody had requested that those get put back in there.”
The House version of the budget is about $6 million higher than Gov. Kay Ivey’s proposed budget, filed in February. 
The chamber also adopted a committee amendment that appropriates money for a statue of Helen Keller on the Alabama State Capitol grounds. 
Reynolds also offered a floor amendment that added $425,000 for a Transportation Pilot Program under the Alabama Department of Human Resources. It passed 97-0.
“The $425,000 is for SAFE, Mary Hill Family Services Center and Circle of Care Center for Families,” Reynolds said.
The Alabama Medicaid Agency, which provides health insurance for over 1 million Alabamians, nearly all children, elderly citizens and those with disabilities, will get $1.179 billion from the state, a $223.8 million (19%) increase over this year. Ivey requested $1.184 billion in February, about $5 million than what the House approved. 
The Alabama Department of Corrections, which administers the state prisons, will get a $90.1 million increase (11%) to $826.7 million. 
The Alabama Department of Human Resources, which provides child and adult protective services, enforces child support payments and administers food and family assistance, will get $148.9 million from the state in 2026, a $4.7 million (3%) increase from the current budget. 
The Alabama Department of Mental Health, which provides mental health care services in the state, will get a $4.7 million increase (2%) to $244 million. The Legislature cut the funding from Ivey’s recommendation by $3.7 million.
“Sustainability is always my priority when developing the budget—we must make decisions that the state can afford not only now but, in the future, as well,” Reynolds said in a statement. “While high interest rates are driving revenue growth in state accounts, that will not always be the case, which is why we must continue to approach this process from a fiscally conservative standpoint.”
House Speaker Nathaniel Ledbetter, R-Rainsville, applauded Reynolds and the committee for their work on the budget. 
“Our budgeting process is calculated, transparent, and guided by the principle of not spending every dollar that comes in,” he said in a statement. “I commend Rep. Reynolds and the members of the House for their work in developing the state’s financial plan for 2026 and setting Alabama up for continued success.”
The budget now goes to the Senate.

(Photo by Dana Wormald/New Hampshire Bulletin)Seven years ago, we were in a tight spot.
My wife, daughters, and I were sharing a house in central New Hampshire with my parents, and even that frugal living arrangement wasn’t enough to make it affordable for any of us after a while. The property taxes were too high and climbing (even in our tight-fisted red town), the cost of upkeep became prohibitive, and there were too many years of paychecks going in the wrong direction. Amid that tense mess, my dad passed away — of course it was his heart — and my sister and her family ended up selling their place next door and taking over the old house, in part so my mom could stay. We all agreed it was the best option of the few available to our extended clan. Meanwhile, the four of us — the family within the family — found a starter home we felt like we could afford and began again in a new town with new schools for the girls. It wasn’t the softest landing, for any of us.
We were unmoored.
The first year in that new life was tough, and we almost lost everything. My wife and I were both working full time but carrying a lot of credit card debt. The minimum payments combined with the mortgage, utilities, and other standard living expenses left us with nothing at the end of the month. If you didn’t know us, if you weren’t there, it would be as good a guess as any that the debt was a result of us living beyond our means. After all, every family has to live within a budget, and every family needs to learn how to trim the fat.
The thing is, there wasn’t any. The thousands in debt wasn’t the result of vacations; we never took any. It wasn’t for nights on the town or Amazon splurges. It is just how much extra it cost, added up over the first 15 years of our life together, to keep a young family of four afloat in New Hampshire. It was for urgent home and car repairs that we didn’t see coming, school clothes and supplies for the girls, all of those incidental bills that turn ledgers red.
In the end, we felt our only option — after exploring all of them — was to do precisely what the experts say you should not do: We cashed out part of my 401(k) to pay off the debt. For us, the choice amounted to sink now or struggle later. In other words, there was no choice at all.

I’m sharing all of these personal details, and uncomfortably so, not because I think my family’s story is unique but because in most ways it isn’t. In America, it is so very expensive to have nothing. And that is why political debate in this country strikes me as a kind of madness. We have created a system that exerts endless economic pressure on the middle and lower classes, and the big myth is that whoever you perceive to be below you on that class ladder is the primary, and undeserving, beneficiary of your hard work, your taxes, your struggle. But they are not. And I have to believe — or at least hope — that all of you will see that one day, whatever political party you support.
The whole of the American political establishment — long owned by the actual beneficiaries of that downward economic pressure — serves as the architect for the grand illusion. But the American right takes the cake — has long taken the cake — for subterfuge and misdirection, and it’s a bitter bite.
In this state, they say:
Don’t ask about the $1.17 billion in lost tax revenue for New Hampshire due to all those ill-advised business tax cuts. The real problem is the transgender women and girls entering our public bathrooms and playing on our school soccer fields.
How can you talk about the N.H. GOP’s repeal of the interest and dividends tax in service to the rich, and the loss of another $150 million-plus toward public services, when we are so clearly under attack by murderous migrants?
Sure, your property taxes are high and getting higher, but don’t blame New Hampshire’s aversion to progressive taxation. The problem, you see, is that school districts are spending all of your hard-earned money on smut and critical race theory lessons.
Speaking of schools, pay no mind to how the Republican voucher program is diverting public money to private and religious schools, amid questionable transparency, and adding to the struggles of our beleaguered public schools. But do you know what you should worry about? People who have very little — those ne’er-do-wells enrolled in Medicaid and SNAP — taking advantage of the system. That’s a much bigger deal than billionaires like Donald Trump, Elon Musk, Jeff Bezos, and Mark Zuckerberg endlessly profiting from a system largely built by and for people just like them.

And don’t worry: Those forever-do-wells will totally have your back once the IRS is too gutted to come after them, environmental regulations no longer stand in the way of their manifest destiny, and the rich-guy tax cuts are extended. The first drops of that multiplied wealth in the top 1 percent might not trickle down to the rest in this lifetime, but just you wait. I mean, if you can’t trust a billionaire and his economic enablers, who can you?
In the years since my wife and I tapped our future to salvage our present, we have never regretted the decision. We’re still here, after all. But the pressure points never go away, and new ones are added. There will be a reckoning when we retire, if we can retire, and the debt pattern is repeating with our daughters through no fault of their own. We worry, constantly, about college costs (even for in-state tuition), the extremely high price of housing, and the direction of a state whose political majority chases every trumped up political issue that comes down the pike while avoiding or worsening the ones that really matter.
As I said, there is nothing particularly unique about our story, except maybe for one thing: We were lucky. Crazy lucky. We’re still standing because we had a small retirement plan to tap, but one little thing could have sent us reeling again in a heartbeat — a lost job, a health issue, even a major home repair would have done it. Would still do it. And now, with state and federal cuts to services underway, I know that a lot of people just like us are about to feel the crushing weight of that final straw.
Why is it so hard to get by when you’ve done everything right, or tried anyway? Shouldn’t paying the bills be a little easier, just a little bit, in the richest country in the world?
If those questions don’t form the immovable center of our politics, I have no idea what it is we are doing.

The storms left a path of major damage in Fayette, Hardeman and McNairy counties, according to the Tennessee Emergency Management Agency (TEMA). Crews with National Weather Service Memphis have deployed to Selmer, Tennessee to assess tornado damage.
Residents of West and Middle Tennessee received multiple severe storm, tornado and flood warnings throughout Wednesday night into the early morning hours Thursday. 
State officials warn that “generational flooding” — flooding so severe it happens once a generation or once a lifetime  — continues to pose a threat to multiple counties in Middle and West Tennessee as multiple rounds of heavy rain are forecast to stretch into Sunday. 
Rain totals could reach at least 10 inches in areas of West Tennessee north of Interstate 40 by the end of the weekend, according to National Weather Service Memphis. The northwest corner of the state could see up to 15 total inches of rain.
Gov. Bill Lee requested an Emergency Declaration for Tennessee and TEMA Director Patrick Sheehan issued a State of Emergency Wednesday evening in anticipation of the severe storms and flooding. 
Lee’s request includes federal assistance for debris removal, emergency protective measures and direct federal assistance.
President Donald Trump approved Lee’s request around 11 a.m. Thursday, making FEMA assistance available to all 95 Tennessee counties. Under the declaration, FEMA can provide equipment and resources to support emergency response, and direct federal assistance under the public assistance program will be provided at 75% federal funding, according to the agency.
The state remains under a level 3 State of Emergency status, which allows state resources to support local requests for assistance following severe weather while continuing to provide support for ongoing Tropical Storm Helene recovery efforts in East Tennessee.
Five deaths, multiple injuries reported
At least five people have been reported dead, state and local officials confirmed.
The Tennessee Department of Health confirmed one death each in McNairy County, Obion County and Carroll County.
A 48-year-old man was pronounced dead in Fayette County around 2 a.m. Thursday after the Fayette County Sheriff’s Office responded to a call reporting a tornado had overturned a modular home, according to the Fayette County Emergency Management Agency.
Four other family members were transported to a nearby hospital, two in critical condition and two in stable condition. The man’s 16-year-old daughter later died at the hospital, the Fayette County Sheriff’s Office confirmed.
Tornado damage assessments begin
NWS Memphis does not yet have an exact number of confirmed tornadoes from Thursday morning’s severe weather event.
Teams are assessing tornado damage in Selmer, Tennessee and Lake City, Arkansas to confirm and classify the strength of tornadoes, according to NWS Memphis.
The agency received additional reports of tornados in the region from spotters and radar but crews have not yet been able to survey damage or confirm.
Tennessee Highway Patrol deployed a strike team to McNairy County to support local officials, according to TEMA.
“My heart breaks for our city and county at this time,” Selmer Mayor Sherry Inman stated in a social media post expressing gratitude for those who have offered assistance or prayers. “Please continue to pray for all the families and homes that have been lost.”
State officials report power outages, roads blocked by water or debris
More than 15,400 power outages were reported across Tennessee as of 4 a.m. Thursday, according to TEMA, including 6,200 outages in Shelby County.
Multiple roads throughout Middle and West Tennessee have been impacted by downed trees and power lines and flooding, according to the Tennessee Department of Transportation (TDOT). Crews are working to clean up debris. 
Excessive rainfall to come
Excessive rainfall is expected to continue Thursday with the “bullseye” of enhanced risk storms encompassing most of West Tennessee from Memphis to Clarksville along Interstate 40. Widespread flash floods are expected, according to NWS Memphis.
Slight risk rain is forecast for Memphis on Friday, with marginal rain expected from Jackson, Tennessee down to Northern Mississippi.
Heavy rain is expected to return to the Memphis area and along Interstate 40 on Saturday.

Whether the General Assembly passes the bill, known as Senate Bill 370, may ultimately be a moot point. The state courts are currently considering a case that could also bring an end to certificate of need laws in North Carolina at the direction of the state Supreme Court, which in October wrote that the lawsuit’s allegations “could render the Certificate of Need law unconstitutional in all its applications.”
Currently, 35 states require health care providers to complete the certificate of need process before creating certain new offerings. In North Carolina, that process is overseen by the Department of Health and Human Services with the aim of restricting “unnecessary increases in health care costs” and “unnecessary health services and facilities based on geographic, demographic and economic consideration.”
The North Carolina Healthcare Association, which represents hospitals, supports the practice, writing in a 2024 policy brief that the program “ensures that hospitals and health systems maintain the resources to provide high-value care to all.”
Proponents of certificate of need laws say they prevent unnecessary expenses on new medical facilities and services that would be underutilized and whose costs would ultimately be passed down to patients. Opponents say that in practice, the program impedes vital health care expansion and forces patients to shoulder the cost of millions in consulting and legal fees that hospitals pay to navigate the certificate of need process.
Sen. Benton Sawrey (R-Johnston), one of the repeal bill’s primary sponsors, criticized the certificate of need process as “anticompetitive,” arguing that by allowing the market to decide where new facilities and services are necessary, patients will be better off and will be able to pay less for medical services.
“Ironically, a government program originally aimed at reducing health care prices is likely inflating them, at least in some situations,” Sawrey said. “I think we can be proactive about this decision, but it requires a willingness to have that discussion rather than fall back time and again on the same entrenched positions that don’t work, don’t control costs, and don’t let innovation occur in North Carolina’s healthcare space.”
Sen. Jim Burgin (R-Harnett), a longtime hospital board member, called the change “long overdue” and said in his experience, the process to receive a certificate of need takes a minimum of two years and $500,000 in legal fees.
“We could do not any cancer treatments in Harnett County up until this past year,” Burgin said. “We went through the CON process in the years, but it took six years — really eight, if you add the work-up to it — from the time we started talking about it.”
Tim Rogers, CEO of the Association for Home and Hospice Care of North Carolina, said during public comment that his group believes the certificate of need law “plays a vital role in ensuring the integrity, quality, and accessibility of this vital service.”
“The CON process helps prevent fraud, waste, and abuse by ensuring that new providers entering into North Carolina meet rigorous regulatory and financial standards before entering the market,” Rogers said. “This screening reduces the risk of bad actors, exploiting Medicare and Medicaid, safeguarding taxpayer dollars while ethical business practices are held.”
Cody Hand, a lobbyist with the North Carolina Radiation Oncology Society, said that linear accelerators, like those Burgin said were held up by the CON process in Harnett County, require such careful review because they emit ionizing radiation and so are classified as nuclear technology.
“They require strict safety protocols that in this state don’t exist outside of the CON process,” Hand said. “The CON process serves as a critical checkpoint in both the safety and the staffing, not necessarily for cost control and not necessarily for planning, but for safety and accountability.”

According to Nessel’s office, Michigan’s energy companies can only request rate increases once every 12 months, measured from the day they file their application. Friday’s announcement comes 364 days after the company’s prior announcement. The office further noted that Consumers’ notice, filed Friday, comes one week before their latest 2.8% rate increase is set to take effect. 
“By allowing Consumers Energy and DTE to file a new rate hike every twelve months, the State is allowing these billion-dollar businesses to ask for more and more before anyone can even gauge the impact of the previous rate hike,” Nessel said in a statement. “Meaning they’re back asking for more money before anybody knows if their proposed investments made any difference in reliability or affordability for customers.”
Both Consumers Energy and DTE have faced criticism and scrutiny over high electricity rates and poor reliability, with Michigan ranking 9th in the nation in the average number of outage minutes per customer, while facing the 14th highest energy cost burden.
Though Consumers Energy has not indicated how much it aims to raise its rates, Nessel’s office noted the company previously requested an 8.2% increase in 2024 and nearly 5% in 2023. The company sells electricity to approximately 1.9 million customers throughout Michigan and natural gas to 1.8 million customers across the state.
“Consumers Energy just got the green-light to raise electric rates, and one week later they’re back with their hands out before putting any of their new earnings to work for their customers,” Nessel said. “My office will continue to hold Consumers Energy and DTE accountable before the Commission, and expose again and again the unjustifiable costs they try, perennially, to foist upon their bill-paying customers.”
Katie Carey, director of media relations for Consumers Energy said Nessel was wrong on the facts, and that her statement was misleading. 
“Consumers Energy has told state regulators we intend to file a rate request no sooner than June 2. We have not made an actual request,” Carey said, with the notice stating the company expects to file its application on or after June 2, 2025.
“As a note, we are required to file the notice following the implementation of the 2016 Energy Law — this is not a new development,” Carey said.

In January, President Donald Trump signed an executive order pausing federal grants and loans, alarming HBCUs, where most students rely on Pell Grants or federal aid. The order was later rescinded, but ongoing cuts leave key support systems in political limbo, said Denise Smith, deputy director of higher education policy and a senior fellow at The Century Foundation, a left-leaning think tank.
Leaders worry about Trump’s rollback of the Justice40 Initiative, a climate change program that relied on HBCUs to tackle environmental justice issues, she said. And there’s uncertainty around programs such as federal work-study and TRIO, which provides college access services to disadvantaged students.
“People are being mum because we’re starting to see a chilling effect,” Smith said. “There’s real fear that resources could be lost at any moment — even the ones schools already know they need to survive.”
Most students at HBCUs rely on Pell Grants or other federal aid, and a fifth of Black college graduates matriculate from HBCUs. Other minority-serving institutions, known as MSIs, that focus on Hispanic and American Indian populations also heavily depend on federal aid.
“It’s still unclear what these cuts will mean for HBCUs and MSIs, even though they’re supposedly protected,” Smith said.
States may be unlikely to make up any potential federal funding cuts to their public HBCUs. And the schools already have been underfunded by states compared with predominantly white schools.










There’s real fear that resources could be lost at any moment — even the ones schools already know they need to survive.

Congress created public, land-grant universities under the Morrill Act of 1862 to serve the country’s agricultural and industrial industries, providing 10 million acres taken from tribes and offering it for public universities such as Auburn and the University of Georgia. But Black students were excluded.
The 1890 Morrill Act required states to either integrate or establish separate land-grant institutions for Black students — leading to the creation of many HBCUs. These schools have since faced chronic underfunding compared with their majority-white counterparts.
‘None of them are equitable’
In 2020, the average endowment of white land-grant universities was $1.9 billion, compared with just $34 million for HBCUs, according to Forbes.
There are other HBCUs that don’t stem from the 1890 law, including well-known private schools such as Fisk University, Howard University, Morehouse College and Spelman College. But more than three-fourths of HBCU students attend public universities, meaning state lawmakers play a significant role in their funding and oversight.
Marybeth Gasman, an endowed chair in education and a distinguished professor at Rutgers University, isn’t impressed by what states have done for HBCUs and other minority-serving institutions so far. She said she isn’t sure there is a state model that can bridge the massive funding inequities for these institutions, even in states better known for their support.
“I don’t think North Carolina or Maryland have done a particularly good job at the state level. Nor have any of the other states. Students at HBCUs are funded at roughly 50-60% of what students at [predominately white institutions] are funded. That’s not right,” said Gasman.
“Most of the bipartisan support has come from the U.S. Congress and is the result of important work by HBCUs and affiliated organizations. I don’t know of a state model that works well, as none of them are equitable.”

Under federal law, states that accept federal land-grant funding are required to match every dollar with state funds.
But in 2023, the Biden administration sent letters to 16 governors warning them that their public Black land-grant institutions had been underfunded by more than $12 billion over three decades.
Tennessee State University alone had a $2.1 billion gap with the University of Tennessee, Knoxville.
At a February meeting hosted by the Tennessee Black Caucus of State Legislators, Tennessee State interim President Dwayne Tucker said the school is focused on asking lawmakers this year for money to keep the school running.
Otherwise, Tucker said at the time, the institution could run out of cash around April or May.
“That’s real money. That’s the money we should work on,” Tucker said, according to a video of the forum.
In some states, lawsuits to recoup long-standing underfunding have been one course of action.
In Maryland, a landmark $577 million legal settlement was reached in 2021 to address decades of underfunding at four public HBCUs.
In Georgia, three HBCU students sued the state in 2023 for underfunding of three HBCUs.
In Tennessee, a recent state report found Tennessee State University has been shortchanged roughly $150 million to $544 million over the past 100 years.
But Tucker said he thinks filing a lawsuit doesn’t make much sense for Tennessee State.
“There’s no account payable set up with the state of Tennessee to pay us $2.1 billion,” Tucker said at the February forum. “And if we want to make a conclusion about whether [that money] is real or not … you’re going to have to sue the state of Tennessee, and I don’t think that makes a whole lot of sense.”
Economic anchors
There are 102 HBCUs across 19 states, Washington, D.C., and the U.S. Virgin Islands, though a large number of HBCUs are concentrated in the South.
Alabama has the most, with 14, and Pennsylvania has the farthest north HBCU.

Beyond education, HBCUs contribute roughly $15 billion annually to their local economies, generate more than 134,000 jobs and create $46.8 billion in career earnings, proving themselves to be economic anchors in under-resourced regions.
Homecoming events at HBCUs significantly bolster local economies, local studies show. North Carolina Central University’s homecoming contributes approximately $2.5 million to Durham’s economy annually.
Similarly, Hampton University’s 2024 homecoming was projected to inject around $3 million into the City of Hampton and the coastal Virginia region, spurred by increased visitor spending and retail sales. In Tallahassee, Florida A&M University’s 2024 homecoming week in October generated about $5.1 million from Sunday to Thursday.
Their significance is especially pronounced in Southern states — such as North Carolina, where HBCUs account for just 16% of four-year schools but serve 45% of the state’s Black undergraduate population.
Smith has been encouraged by what she’s seen in states such as Maryland, North Carolina and Tennessee, which have a combined 20 HBCUs among them. Lawmakers have taken piecemeal steps to expand support for HBCUs through policy and funding, she noted.
Tennessee became the first state in 2018 to appoint a full-time statewide higher education official dedicated to HBCU success for institutions such as Fisk and Tennessee State. Meanwhile, North Carolina launched a bipartisan, bicameral HBCU Caucus in 2023 to advocate for its 10 HBCUs, known as the NC10, and spotlight their $1.7 billion annual economic impact.
“We created a bipartisan HBCU caucus because we needed people in both parties to understand these institutions’ importance. If you represent a district with an HBCU, you should be connected to it,” said North Carolina Democratic Sen. Gladys Robinson, an alum of private HBCU Bennett College and state HBCU North Carolina A&T State University.
“It took constant education — getting folks to come and see, talk about what was going on,” she recalled. “It’s like beating the drum constantly until you finally hear the beat.”

For Robinson, advocacy for HBCUs can be a tough task, especially when fellow lawmakers aren’t aware of the stories of these institutions. North Carolina A&T was among the 1890 land-grant universities historically undermatched in federal agricultural and extension funding.

The NC Promise Tuition Plan, launched in 2018, reduced in-state tuition to $500 per semester and out-of-state tuition to $2,500 per semester at a handful of schools that now include HBCUs Elizabeth City State University and Fayetteville State University; Western Carolina University, a Hispanic-serving institution; and UNC at Pembroke, founded in 1887 to serve American Indians.
Through conversations on the floor of the General Assembly, and with lawmakers on both sides of the aisle, Robinson advocated to ensure Elizabeth City State — a struggling HBCU — was included, which helped revive enrollment and public investment.
“I’m hopeful because we’ve been here before,” Robinson said in an interview.
“These institutions were built out of churches and land by people who had nothing, just so we could be educated,” Robinson said. “We have people in powerful positions across the country. We have to use our strength and our voices. Alumni must step up.
“It’s tough, but not undoable.”
Meanwhile, other states are working to recognize certain colleges that offer significant support to Black college students. California last year passed a law creating a Black-serving Institution designation, the first such title in the country. Schools must have programs focused on Black achievement, retention and graduation rates, along with a five-year plan to improve them. Sacramento State is among the first receiving the designation.
And this session, California state Assemblymember Mike Gipson, a Democrat, introduced legislation that proposes a $75 million grant program to support Black and underserved students over five years through the Designation of California Black-Serving Institutions Grant Program. The bill was most recently referred to the Assembly’s appropriations committee.

(David Montgomery/Stateline)WATER VALLEY, Texas — On a recent day when the wind gusted close to 40 miles per hour, 82-year-old George Neill was making repairs on his ranch, oblivious to the nearby cluster of wind turbines churning the sky behind him.
“After about a year, you never know the things are here,” said Neill, who leases part of his West Texas property to an East Coast-based renewable energy company that placed three wind turbines on it four years ago.
Hundreds of other wind turbines stretch across this landscape, instantly visible to motorists traveling to nearby San Angelo and other towns. The turbines aren’t the only renewable energy producers amid the mesas: From a distance, a glistening array of solar panels resembles a small lake.
Texas is famous for producing oil and gas, but renewable energy has become deeply embedded in the state’s culture and economy. Texas led the nation in generating electricity from wind power and utility-scale solar power in 2023, and wind and solar energy projects contribute tax revenue to local governments and struggling school districts. Texas landowners are expected to receive nearly $30 billion in lease payments under current and expected projects, according to an industry study.
But in recent years, Texas has loosened its political embrace of alternative energy. For the second legislative session in a row, many Texas lawmakers are trying to derail or curb future renewable energy projects.













They are relatively new players to the market, so there’s going to be pushback from incumbents.


– Joshua Rhodes, research scientist at the University of Texas at Austin





The shift is rooted in a number of a factors, including the second Trump administration’s antipathy toward renewables and an aggressive recommitment to fossil fuels in Texas energy policy. There is lingering concern over the reliability of the state’s electrical grid, after all types of power sources failed during a devastating 2021 winter storm. Some people object to the aesthetics of wind and solar farms, or note that turbines and panels can harm some wildlife.
Texas is not alone. Once focused on stopping individual projects at the local level, renewable energy opponents have been making inroads in other state legislatures, too. They have received backing from the oil and gas industry. And they’ve been galvanized by the 2022 passage of the Inflation Reduction Act, the largest-ever attempt to speed the transition to clean energy.
In neighboring Oklahoma, for example, hundreds of people rallied at the state Capitol in January to urge Republican Gov. Kevin Stitt to issue an executive order halting new wind and solar projects. Like Texas, Oklahoma is a major oil and natural gas producer, but it generated 45% of its total in-state electricity from renewable resources in 2023.
Stitt, a strong supporter of renewable energy, is highly unlikely to issue such an order. But he will leave office in two years, and several Republicans discussed as possible successors appeared at the rally. One of them, Attorney General Gentner Drummond, last month on social media criticized what he called “the green energy scam” and urged Stitt and state lawmakers to tighten wind farm rules during the current session.
In Arizona, the House earlier this year approved a bill that would bar wind farm projects within a dozen miles of any property zoned for residential use — a restriction that would apply to about 90% of the land in the state, according to an analysis by the Arizona Republic.
In Ohio, a 2021 law allowing county commissioners to create restricted areas where utility-scale solar and wind projects can’t be built has had a huge impact, as 26 Ohio counties have banned renewable energy projects. This year, GOP lawmakers have introduced legislation that would end all state solar subsidies.
And in Missouri, Republican legislators are pushing a bill that would raise taxes on farmers who lease their land for wind or solar energy projects.
The expanding opposition to renewables isn’t unexpected, said Joshua Rhodes, a research scientist at the University of Texas at Austin who studies the power grid. He noted that wind, solar and battery storage have rapidly become the “cheapest way to put more energy on the grid.”
“They’re victims of their own success,” he told Stateline. “They are relatively new players to the market, so there’s going to be pushback from incumbents.”
 Opposing sides

At the center of the current debate in Texas is state Sen. Lois Kolkhorst, a Republican committee chair who has resurrected a 2023 bill that would require new utility-scale solar and wind projects to get permits from the state’s Public Utility Commission, regulations that aren’t imposed on projects for natural gas and other energy sources. The bill also calls for set-back requirements and cleanup funds.













The land isn’t just a piece of property to us. It’s our home, our sanctuary and a big part of who we are.


– Laurie Dihle, who lives on 154 acres in Franklin County, Texas





Kolkhorst, in a statement to Stateline, called the legislation “a common-sense approach to the encroachment of wind and solar facilities being scattered across our great state with no consideration or safeguards for landowners or the environment.”
At an hourslong Senate committee hearing recently where opponents of Kolkhorst’s bill outnumbered supporters, farmers, ranchers and small-town Texans sometimes found themselves on opposite sides, either arguing that sprawling wind farms and solar arrays are a lasting source of economic vitality or a threat to a beloved way of life.
“The land isn’t just a piece of property to us,” said Laurie Dihle, who lives on 154 acres in Franklin County with her husband. “It’s our home, our sanctuary and a big part of who we are. When we look out across the road, we see rolling green pastures and trees. Now we’re facing the possibility of that view and so much more being replaced by a sprawling solar farm.”
Environmentalists and industry representatives view Kolkhorst’s bill as a roadblock in the march toward green energy. Luke Metzger, executive director of Environment Texas, said the bill would open the door to “a really arbitrary discriminatory permitting regime,” requiring wind and solar developers to get permits that other energy producers do not have to have.
Describing herself as a “lifelong wildlife conservationist,” Kolkhorst said she introduced the bipartisan bill with nine other senators in an effort that “looks past the billions in wind and solar subsidies to instead focus on the total impact of these projects on our land, people and wildlife.”
But oil and gas projects also can harm wildlife, and scientists note that the emissions released by fossil fuels worsen climate change disasters.
Insiders following the legislation, including Metzger, identify one of the bill’s major supporters as Kolkhorst donor Dan Friedkin, a billionaire Houston businessman.
Friedkin, chairman emeritus of the Texas Parks and Wildlife Commission, is owner and CEO of The Friedkin Group, a consortium of businesses and investments that includes Gulf States Toyota. Gulf States is one of the world’s largest distributors of Toyota vehicles and parts, with exclusive rights to sell Toyotas in Texas and four other states. Gulf States Toyota Inc. State PAC made four donations totaling $42,500 to Kolkhorst from October of 2020 to October of 2024, according to the Texas Ethics Commission.
Friedkin is a stunt pilot and outdoorsman with a ranch in South Texas. Neither he nor his lobbyist, Laird Doran, senior vice president for public and legal affairs at The Friedkin Group, returned phone calls from Stateline.
Texas lawmakers have filed dozens of wind- and solar-related bills this session, including measures aimed at restricting the placement of battery storage facilities, curbing tax breaks and subsidies for renewable companies and limiting the amount of electricity solar and wind projects contribute to the state’s power grid.
Republican state Sen. Phil King, for example, is pushing a bill that would mandate that 50% of all new electricity must come from natural gas, nuclear or battery storage. King said solar and wind power should be part of the state’s energy mix, but he claims they aren’t reliable enough to serve as the foundation.
State Rep. Don McLaughlin, a Republican, has introduced legislation mandating a study of the economic impact of wind and solar projects on local communities, as well as noise and health effects, threats to wildlife and the challenges of disassembling worn-out systems. Sweetwater, Texas, has thousands of composite blades piled up in “a windmill graveyard.”
 Rural support

But many rural GOP lawmakers whose districts long ago sprouted oil rigs and pump jacks are now strong supporters of wind and solar power.
“It’s nonstop windmills on both side of the road for 70 miles,” said state Rep. John Smithee of Amarillo, describing a typical drive from his hometown in the Texas Panhandle to the Capitol in Austin. “Almost all of those [constituents] have benefited.”
State Rep. Drew Darby, whose northwest Texas district includes San Angelo and Water Valley, an unincorporated community of around 300, said revenue from wind power has resulted in countywide improvements and lease payments to property owners.
“It’s been a positive impact on rural effectiveness,” said Darby. “Landowners … are receiving nice payments for leasing the property.”
In Water Valley, taxes from the increased revenue paved the way for a tax-free bond election that enabled the town’s K-12 school to add an upscale weight room, a technical educational facility and a “cafetorium” that serves as a dining room and performance hall. The school building had previously been so small that students had to eat in shifts.
The wind farm is expected to generate $123 million in local taxes over the 30-year life of the project, as well as more than $100 million in payments to landowners.
George Neill, the West Texas rancher, said he takes the wind turbines in stride as he roams across his 1,700-acre spread.
He’s not at liberty to reveal the amount of his payments. He’s not getting rich, he said, but the money “makes a difference when you’re trying run a ranch.”

The measure (SB 56), sponsored by Miami Republican Ileana Garcia, would prohibit the injection, release, or dispersion of any means of a chemical, chemical compound, substance, or apparatus into the atmosphere for the purpose of affecting the climate.
Any person or corporation who conducts such geoengineering or weather modification activity would be subject to a third-degree felony charge, with fines up to $100,000. If an aircraft operator or controller commits a third-degree felony, they could be subject to a fine up to $5,000 and up to five years in prison.
“There is a lot of unauthorized activity that is currently not regulated both at a federal and a state level, and this is where we wanted to start,” Garcia told members of the Senate. “This is how we are trying to create a method to the madness by creating a reporting mechanism that starts with complaints to the Department of Environmental Protection [DEP] with complaints and concerns and then also at our local state airports.”
In questions on the Senate floor, Broward County Democrat Tina Polsky asked Garcia how could the DEP accurately investigate such a complaint if the “trail” dissipates in the atmosphere?
Garcia replied that the DEP could coordinate with other agencies such as the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration and “based on certain concerns or certain complaints or certain criteria” could decide what was “worthy” of following up on a more scientific basis.
The Miami Republican acknowledged that there were “conspiracy theories” regarding the issue, and said that while she didn’t want to get political, concerns about geoengineering had accelerated under former President Joe Biden.
“The previous administration … sort of opened up that area of allowing, I would say, apprentices to a certain extent based on a lot of the research that I’d seen or just various companies, various corporations from across the world, to come into our atmosphere and start experimenting with, whether it’s rock weathering, whether it’s solar radiation modification, whether it’s cloud seeding — something as simple as sending up a $30 balloon that you can buy on Amazon with specific chemicals so that you can alter the weather or solar radiation,” she said.
“It seems very concerning to me. I have a problem with people spraying perfume next to me sometimes. Don’t you have a problem with people spraying things into the atmosphere that really have no type of empirical data?”
The measure passed the Senate on a 28-9 vote.
‘Great piece of legislation’
Following the vote, Senate President Ben Albritton praised Garcia for producing a “great piece of legislation.”
Healthy skepticism is important,” he said in a written statement. “People have a right to know what is happening. There’s a lot we don’t know in this field of science and people are rightfully concerned.”
Gov. Ron DeSantis posted on social media a video announcing his support for Garcia’s bill, but slammed the House version (HB 477), sponsored by Pasco County Republican Kevin Steele, saying that it’s “gutted” Garcia’s measure.
“They would actually codify the practice of geoengineering and weather modification,” DeSantis said. “People got a lot of kooky ideas that they can get in and  put things in the atmosphere to block the sun and save us from climate change. We’re not playing that game in Florida.”
Steele’s bill has one more committee to get through before making it to the floor of the House.
Last month, Health & Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. said in a social media post that banning  geoengineering “is a movement every MAHA needs to support.”

Buttitta was one of roughly 200 veterans, VA nurses, union members and others who gathered outside the Durham VA Medical Center on Wednesday to protest the proposed cuts they contend will be catastrophic for patient care at the VA.
“We have to stop this now,” Buttitta said. “You can’t take this sitting down. You gotta’ get up and get out and protest this. Write every elected representative, call them on the phone and tell them you’re mad as you can be about this. This is not right, this is a betrayal.”
President Donald Trump used service members and veterans as “props” during the presidential campaign, then turned his back on them, Buttitta said.
“The first opportunity he [Trump] gets, he starts cutting programs,” Buttitta said. “They start taking their DOGE [Department of Government Efficiency] budget and slashing everything to do with the government without doing any kind of research beforehand.”
Big national layoffs
The Trump administration has proposed massive VA layoffs as part of the president’s controversial strategy to streamline the federal government. DOGE is led by tech-billionaire Elon Musk, who weeks ago made a show of wielding a large chainsaw to demonstrate how he planned to cut away at what he contends are rampant fraud and waste in the federal government.
In Asheville last month, U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs Secretary Doug Collins was adamant that veterans’ “health care and benefits are not being cut.” He acknowledged that 14 or 15 staff members at the Asheville VA were among the 2,400 probationary employees laid off. The layoffs in Asheville included one executive assistant, interior designers and some stock clerks, Collins said.
“Most of that is statutory and that’s not something we’re going to cut in the sense of what’s being said,” said Collins, an Iraq War veteran and former Air Force chaplain.

The proposed staffing cuts come amid recent reports by the VA Office of Inspector General which show severe existing staffing shortages in Veterans Health Administration facilities. In fiscal year 2024, 86% of such facilities reported severe occupational staffing shortages for medical officers and 82% reported severe shortages for nurses, the report said.
Buyer’s remorse?
Meanwhile, Buttitta said some Trump supporters in Craven County have begun to have buyer’s remorse, just months into Trump’s second term. Trump handily won Craven County where Buttitta now lives. The president received 59.6% of the vote compared to 33.5% for former Vice President Kamala Harris.
“Some of those people [Trump supporters] are at the end of their rope and they’re starting to get pissed off because … People voted for Trump and where proud of it, now it’s [support for the president] starting to fall apart around the edges. A lot of people are starting to have second thoughts because it’s starting to hit them where it hurts.”
At the Durham VA, on a day when pollen hung thick in the air, protesters’ chants competed against whirring propellers of a Duke Life Flight helicopter, screaming sirens as ambulances whisked by and the honking horns of passersby showing support for sign-toting veterans, VA staffers and union members.   
Like Buttitta, many service members in attendance said proposed Trump administration budget cuts felt like a betrayal. The cuts, they contend, will make it difficult for VAs across the country to adequately serve military men and women who were willing to risk it all after taking the Oath of Enlistment.

The wrong time for staffing cuts
Ann Marie Patterson-Powell, a VA nurse and an officer with National Nurses United (NNU), the country’s largest union and professional association of registered nurses, said Trump administration cuts would reduce VA staffing to 2019 levels at a time when workloads have increased due to the Promise to Address Comprehensive Toxics (PACT) Act, which added more than 400,000 veterans to VA health care rolls.
The PACT Act expanded VA health care and benefits for veterans exposed to toxic substances, including those exposed to burn pits and Agent Orange.
“With the added patients, we can’t survive at 2019 staffing levels,” Patterson-Powell said. “We cannot afford to have anyone cut from the VA because any cuts from the VA system affects patient care because we’re here to give care to veterans, all of us.”
Patterson-Powell said VA staffers were told there were about 17 probationary staffers let go from the Durham VA about two weeks ago. Remaining staffers were not told where the cuts were made, she said. NC Newsline could not independently confirm the Durham layoffs. Public information staff onsite declined to comment about Wednesday’s rally or to answer questions about any cuts that might have taken place.
“It’s almost like a secret, and they have not told us,” Patterson-Powell said, when asked if she knew where the cuts were made.
Patient care jeopardized
Irma Westmoreland, a registered nurse and chair of Veterans Affair for NNU who lives in Augusta, Ga., said patient care will suffer if the proposed staffing cuts are made.
“We are eroding patient care that we can provide to our veterans at a time when patient care is needed and it’s morally reprehensible,” Westmoreland said. “We must address these threats to our VA by naming the root cause … Trump and Elon Musk.”

Westmoreland said the VA is at a crossroads that will determine its future.
“On the one hand we have successfully brought care to more veterans on an almost unprecedented level,” she said. “On the other hand, just as the VA is struggling to meet that challenge, we’re faced with even deeper cuts with the proposal to lay off more workers.”
MaryBe McMillan, president of the North Carolina State AFL-CIO, said Americans must fight back against VA cuts and others being made across the federal government.
McMillan urged protesters to fight for a system the works for “we the people” instead of a “handful of billionaires.”
“This is a fight for all working people because laying off thousands and thousands of federal workers and cutting essential services affects all of us,” McMillan said. “It impacts veterans, it endangers the safety of our air, our food and transportation systems. It impacts millions of Americans who depend on life-saving programs like Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid.”",https://ncnewsline.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/IMG_4173-1024x768.jpeg,,,2025-04-03 12:18:24.739763

Under current law, school and park zones contain “the area within 300 feet or one city block, whichever distance is greater,” of the school or park property line.
The DFL-sponsored legislation (SF3207/HF2980) would reduce that buffer to 100 feet across the board.
People who possess drugs or attempt to sell them in school or park zones face stiffer penalties under a Drug War-era law aiming to protect children from the harms of drug use. 
In reality, few people ensnared by the law are actually attempting to target kids. Because of the way the law is written, prosecutors can charge people with prohibited zone violations simply for driving past a school incidentally during the course of their day.
In rural Polk County, for instance, a Reformer investigation found that prosecutors have filed prohibited zone charges against people who used drugs inside a home located within a block of a school; a homeless man who walked across a bridge near a park; and a woman who parked her car at an apartment complex within a block of a city park.
Statewide, few prosecutors apply the law this way. Polk County, for instance, is home to just 0.5% of the state population but prosecutors there charge 40% of the state’s prohibited zone violations. 
Although Polk County has successfully defended its use of the statute in appellate courts, defense attorneys have argued it’s a violation of the Equal Protection Clause of the U.S. Constitution. The uneven application of the law is a driver of the reform effort in the Legislature this year.
“This legislation is the start of a much-needed conversation on reforming drug-free zones in Minnesota to ensure the state has uniformity around criminal penalties,” said Jenny Catchings, a state policy manager with the Justice Action Network, which supports the bill. “This law has been misconstrued — to the point that there are valid reasons to see constitutional rights issues — and Minnesota now has a system of justice-by-geography around drug-free zones, with some counties as notable outliers.”
The reform bill would dramatically shrink the areas defined as school or park zones in Minnesota. The map below, for instance, illustrates how drug-free zones would change in East Grand Forks, the largest city in Polk County.

 
In the map, green areas are parks and plum-colored areas are schools. The regions shaded peach, representing distances of 300 feet or one city block beyond park and school property lines, are also considered drug-free zones under current law. The dark brown outlines show the much smaller extent of those buffers under the proposed law.
In practice, the one-block provision of current law means entire neighborhoods become drug-free zones if a tiny park is located within them, or if a neighborhood abuts the city’s sprawling Greenway: the vast natural area surrounding the Red and Red Lake rivers.
The illustration of drug-free zones under current law should be considered an approximation, as the statutes do not define a “block” for the purposes of calculating the extent of a drug-free zone. State courts have held that for drug-free zones in places with regular street grids, the buffer encompasses all eight blocks surrounding the block a school or park is located on.
But considerable uncertainty remains: What about situations where streets form “blocks” of irregular shape or size? What about cases where parkland, like the East Grand Forks Greenway, extends partially into a block? What happens near the margins of a town, where the distance between two roads can be a quarter mile or more?
Those ambiguities have not been addressed by the courts, meaning an enterprising prosecutor could file drug-free zone charges under any number of edge-case scenarios and try to get a judge to go along with it (Polk County Attorney Greg Widseth did not respond to a request for comment).
The reform bill would eliminate all of that uncertainty, replacing it with an across-the-board 100-foot buffer. But it would still leave the door open to aggressive prosecutions. 
Nothing would stop prosecutors from charging drug-free zone violations for simply driving past a school, as is practice in Polk County. And in a city like East Grand Forks, which is bounded entirely on one side by a large tract of parkland, it would remain impossible to traverse the city without passing through a drug-free zone.
The bill’s odds of passage this year are uncertain, as most legislative committees have a deadline of April 4 to advance bills under consideration. And with a 67-67 House, bills need bipartisan support to reach the necessary 68 votes needed for passage.",https://minnesotareformer.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/GettyImages-684174078-1024x684.jpg,,,2025-04-03 12:18:24.739763

(Photo by Michael Moline/Florida Phoenix)The Florida Supreme Court has rejected former Lt. Gen. Michael Flynn’s attempt to reinstate his $50 million defamation claim against Lincoln Project co-founder Rick Wilson over comments linking Flynn to Vladimir Putin and the QAnon conspiracy theory.
“This cause having heretofore been submitted to the Court on jurisdictional briefs and portions of the record deemed necessary to reflect jurisdiction under Article V, Section 3(b), Florida Constitution, and the Court having determined that it should decline to accept jurisdiction, it is ordered that the petition for review is denied,” the court said.
“No motion for rehearing will be entertained by the Court,” the justices added. Signing the order were justices John Couriel, Renatha Francis, Jamie Grosshans, Jorge Labarga, and Meredith Sasso. The decision came down on Wednesday.

“We’re not surprised, given the vast legal weaknesses of this trolling lawfare on their part,” Wilson told the Phoenix by text. “It is gratifying to know that it’s all over.”
The next step, Wilson said, is to seek to recover his legal costs from Flynn. “The process of which started immediately.”
A Sarasota state trial judge had ruled Wilson’s comments were protected by the First Amendment, and the Florida Second District Court of Appeal affirmed, citing the “profound national commitment to the principle that debate on public issues should be uninhibited, robust, and wide-open, and that it may well include vehement, caustic, and sometimes unpleasantly sharp attacks.”
Flynn briefly served as national security adviser during Donald Trump’s first term but was fired for allegedly lying to the FBI and Vice President Mike Pence about discussions with the Russian government before Trump took office.
The alleged defamation arose in part from a Wilson post referring to “Putin employee Mike Flynn.” In 2015, the state-sponsored Russia Today television network paid Flynn $45,000 to speak during a dinner in Moscow; a photo shows Flynn seated next to Putin at the event.
Additionally, Wilson retweeted a social media post by podcaster Jim Stewartson reading, “FYI, Mike Flynn is Q.” Flynn argued that QAnon is a terrorist organization and that the reference was defamatory. However, the trial court record notes that Flynn has used the QAnon slogan, “Where we go one, we go all,” and “WWG1WGA,” and authorized sale of merchandize with those slogans.
Courts rejecting Flynn’s lawsuit cited Florida’s SLAPP law, referring to “strategic lawsuits against public participation.” These are actions designed to intimidate or silence critics.

The U.S. Forest Service announced this week that it will temporarily prohibit commercial picking of huckleberries this summer in Gifford Pinchot National Forest in southwestern Washington. 
Commercially picked berries have fueled an entire huckleberry industry, flavoring ice cream, sodas, pies, jams, vodkas and wines – at the expense of Yakama Nation tribal members, as detailed in High Country News’ March feature.
“Huckleberries are a vital cultural and ecological resource, and we must ensure their sustainability for generations to come,” Johanna Kovarik, Gifford Pinchot’s forest supervisor, said in a written statement. “This change allows us to work more closely with tribal governments, and local stakeholders and law enforcement to improve management while reducing conflicts.”
The announcement comes after years of complaints from members of the Ḱamíłpa Band of the Yakama Nation about the agency’s commercial program. Gifford Pinchot is the only national forest that allows large-scale commercial harvest of huckleberries, which are a traditional food for the Yakama Nation and other Pacific Northwest Indigenous peoples. Members of the Yakama Nation have reserved rights under their 1855 treaty with the U.S. government to harvest huckleberries in Gifford Pinchot National Forest. 
“Our elders, I think, are smiling about this,” said Trina Sherwood, a 60-year-old Ḱamíłpa member and food gatherer. 
“It’s like a dream come true,” said Elaine Harvey, 48, who is Sherwood’s niece and also a food gatherer from the Ḱamíłpa Band. Harvey and others in her family have pushed the Forest Service to ban commercial picking for years, which she said has infringed on tribal members’ treaty rights to harvest. Both Harvey and Sherwood hope that the Forest Service will permanently prohibit commercial harvesting. 
Federal officials will conduct an assessment and consult with tribes this year before making any long-term changes to the commercial program. Forest Service officials were not immediately available for an interview.  
Most commercial pickers descend from Vietnamese and Cambodian families who came to the U.S. in the 1970s and found work picking huckleberries for low wages. Pickers sell berries directly to individual commercial huckleberry buyers, who are often small business owners or contractors for wild food companies, like Mikuni Wild Harvest, a Canadian corporation with a distribution center in Tacoma. Those companies then sell to private customers, chefs, wineries and other companies that create huckleberry products. Tillamook Creamery, according to a Forest Service official, buys berries harvested from Gifford Pinchot for the company’s huckleberry ice cream. In its press release, the Forest Service said that commercial pickers take 50,000 to 70,000 gallons of berries from the forest each year.
Huckleberries grow only in the mountains and have resisted Western scientists’ decades-long attempts to cultivate their genes to grow them on farms. That’s why the berries fetch a high price — up to $200 a gallon. Commercial pickers pay either $60 for a two-week permit with a 40-gallon limit, or $105 for a seasonal permit with a 70-gallon limit. Gifford Pinchot sold 928 permits last season, totaling $83,445 in revenue.
During annual meetings with Forest Service officials, Harvey and other Yakama Nation leaders have said that commercial pickers leave few berries for tribal members. They threaten elders, who are mostly women, by blocking roads, picking closely off the same bush and bringing dogs to the fields. Some also damage the shrubs, using illegal rakes to quickly strip berries from the bushes. Tribal members have observed commercial pickers harvesting berries before the commercial season begins in mid-August and encroaching on areas reserved for exclusive tribal harvest. “We’ve always explained it, year after year, that the situation is getting worse,” Harvey said of meetings with agency officials. “There was always the question of, ‘Why do we have to have commercial harvest?’”
In the past, Sherwood could harvest four to six gallons of berries per day. But with the increase in commercial pickers, she’s lucky if she can pick one-and-a-half gallons for herself. “It just has really changed the landscape with all this commercial picking,” she said. “I go back to places where I used to see berries in abundance, and it’s all just taken away.”
The Forest Service cited “sustainability concerns, enforcement challenges and escalating conflicts among harvesters,” as reasons for not issuing commercial permits this season but did not specifically mention the program’s impact on Yakama Nation members’ treaty rights to gather. Drought, habitat loss and invasive species, such as the spotted winged drosophila, a small fruit fly whose larvae have been found inside huckleberries, are also among the agency’s cited concerns.
Harvey and Sherwood want to see more Forest Service officers within the fields this summer to enforce the ban and protect tribal pickers who may face intimidation or harassment from those who oppose the temporary commercial closure. But the Forest Service has struggled to adequately patrol the fields for years, citing a lack of funding. And as the Trump administration has slashed the federal workforce, including Forest Service employees, Harvey worries that the agency won’t be able to increase patrols. “Hopefully people will be safe this summer,” she said.
Harvey was part of a volunteer federal committee appointed under the Biden administration that developed amendments to the Northwest Forest Plan, many of which center on cultural resource management. In those committee meetings, Harvey regularly brought up the impacts that Gifford Pinchot’s commercial huckleberry program has had on her community. “I think that’s when the real push came,” Harvey said, and Forest Service officials started to listen. But federal officials told committee members earlier this month that the agency will likely disband the group. With fewer federal employees, Harvey is concerned about how that will affect the temporary commercial harvesting ban and the Forest Service’s ability to complete the Northwest Forest Plan update.
Sherwood is proud of the efforts over the years by her family, including her niece Elaine Harvey, to advocate for the protection of huckleberries. “It’s always been instilled in us, by our elders, our mothers, our grandmothers,” Sherwood said of speaking up for traditional foods. “We’re very protective of our resources.”
The Ḱamíłpa Band has a long history of defending their treaty rights to gather huckleberries and other traditional foods that have been threatened by Forest Service mismanagement. Ḱamíłpa Chief atway William Yallup established what’s known as the Handshake Agreement in 1932, which reserved part of the berry fields in Gifford Pinchot for exclusive tribal harvest. Nearly 50 years later, Sherwood’s family pushed the Forest Service in the 1980s to allow the Ḱamíłpa Band to reestablish a traditional huckleberry feast in the fields to commence berry season, in late July or early August. Her brother and Ḱamíłpa Chief, atway Fred Ike Sr., worked with Cielo Chief atway Howard Jim, along with elders, including Sherwood’s parents, Moses Dick Sr. and Elsie Billy Dick, to host an annual feast. “We wanted to revitalize that history and recognize it and make sure our presence was known,” Sherwood said. 
She now helps organize the feast with Harvey and other family members, gathering berries and enough food to feed the longhouse for a few days. Her grandmother, atway Susie Walsey Billy, lived for weeks at Sawtooth Mountain in Gifford Pinchot during huckleberry season. “They’d stay there until it snowed,” Sherwood said. “I think about that a lot, and that’s what’s pushed me forward.”
Harvey, as well as Ḱamíłpa Chief Bronsco Jim Jr. and Yakama Nation Tribal Council member Jeremy Takala, will discuss the commercial huckleberry program and the Forest Service’s latest change at an event hosted by High Country News and the Native Arts + Cultures Foundation on April 9 in Portland, Oregon.",https://washingtonstatestandard.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/us-forest-service-huckleberry.jpg,,,2025-04-03 12:18:24.739763

Gretchen Whitmer.
Adam Fox and Barry Croft Jr. were found guilty in August 2022 of conspiring to kidnap and conspiring to use a weapon of mass destruction in connection to an effort that sought to kidnap Whitmer from her vacation home in northern Michigan in 2020. Federal prosecutors said the pair were part of a group that orchestrated the scheme in retaliation for her COVID-19 restrictions early on in the pandemic. 
Croft, 41 and a trucker from Delaware, was additionally found guilty of possession of an unregistered destructive device and was sentenced to just over 19-and-a-half years in prison. Fox, 49 and from Grand Rapids, is serving a 16-year prison sentence.
Attorneys for the pair appealed their convictions, arguing that there was insufficient evidence to find them guilty and that judicial rulings during the trial unfairly limited both the defense’s time for cross-examination as well as “the scope of the admissibility of certain government informant statements.”
However, in a 3-0 ruling Tuesday, the 6th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals disagreed and let the convictions stand.
“Based on the evidence presented at trial, the jury saw and heard a host of video and audio recordings of Defendants promising violence, planning and participating in trainings, bringing their own weapons and material, and plotting the abduction without reluctance,” the opinion said. It also said the defendants had presented “weak” evidence that they had been entrapped by government informants.
It was the second trial for Fox and Croft after an initial jury could not reach a verdict, while acquitting two other defendants, Daniel Harris and Brandon Caserta. Of the 14 individuals charged in both state and federal court with taking part in the plot, five were acquitted.
Authorities say the group sought to create chaos in the days leading up to the 2020 general election. Investigators said Fox and Croft conspired to obtain a weapon of mass destruction, related to their attempt to purchase explosives that could be used to blow up a bridge near Whitmer’s vacation home in order to slow police response to the kidnapping.
Evidence presented during both trials indicated Fox twice traveled to northern Michigan to scout out the area around Whitmer’s second home with Croft and an undercover agent coming along on one of the trips.
While authorities only charged the defendants with trying to kidnap Whitmer, she has maintained the ultimate goal of the plot was to murder her.
“The intent was not about ransom,” Whitmer said in an October 2020 interview with the Michigan Advance. “It was to put me on some sort of a trial and execute me. And for some reason that seems to have been lost in all of the coverage.”

(Getty Images)When the government puts legal barriers in place to strip away or prevent health care access, it’s not just politics — it’s real people’s lives at stake.
During the summer of 2024, countless transgender and gender expansive patients expressed to me fears about what might happen to their access to gender affirming medical care if a conservative administration were to win the White House. This worst-case scenario became reality in the first weeks of 2025, when President Donald Trump signed an executive order redefining legal gender identity as a strict binary of male and female — effectively erasing recognition of nonbinary and transgender individuals and interrupting federal funding to institutions providing gender-affirming health care.
As a transgender health program intern, I have seen providers try to reassure patients of their well-being and safety while they themselves fear how their job will be affected if the laws would drastically alter the way we practice medicine.
As a gay man about to enter the medical profession, I am afraid. The recent wave of anti-trans initiatives pushed by this administration is part of a much broader effort to dismantle diversity, equity, inclusion, and belonging (DEIB) programs across the country under the guise of “restoring meritocracy” and “leveling the playing field.” But in health care, the playing field has never been level. Minority populations continue to face disproportionate health risks and barriers to care.
DEIB is the foundation of medical education. It teaches future physicians how to address these disparities and combat the structural inequities that put vulnerable patients at risk. Studies show medical students have felt unprepared to manage transgender and gender expansive patients upon graduation. One study even claimed that only 27% of students were confident in their knowledge of the health needs of transgender patients. Beyond that, they could not correctly answer questions about race-related medical history despite affirming that understanding historical context is important in medicine. This lack of education was always a problem, and efforts were underway to solve it. Eliminating DEIB would not only erode this progress but set us back behind where we were even before we started.
In 2020, the American Association of Medical Colleges (AAMC) rolled out the Structural Competency Curriculum which aims to train providers “to recognize and respond to the impact of upstream, structural factors on patient health and health care.” Since then, medical schools around the country have adopted the values of this curriculum and incorporated it throughout the course of their students’ training. Health equity is a core pillar of medical students’ professional development and should be embedded into the culture of patient-centric care.
When DEIB is dismantled, programs like these disappear, and awareness of health disparities among marginalized patient populations fades from the culture of those whose job is to provide the proper care and treatment.
If physicians are not trained on specific health risks that directly impact transgender patients, how can we provide adequate care? If we are not taught about racial health disparities, how will we work to combat them? If we stop prioritizing inclusion, how can we ensure equal health care for all?
Everyone deserves to be treated with respect and dignity. Legislation cannot change a person’s identity, but it will change their access to health care. Medical schools need to teach this, and we as students want to learn. Future doctors like me are watching everything that is happening, and we are worried. When students apply to medical school, the number one question they are asked is, “Why medicine?” While the answer to this question can take many different forms, the bottom line is pretty simple: We want to help people. Medical schools can make a monumental difference in how future doctors navigate this political environment and provide care to patients. We urge medical schools to keep teaching us how to do that for all patients.",https://newhampshirebulletin.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/transhealthcare-1024x683.jpeg,,,2025-04-03 12:18:24.739763

Kentucky Gov. Andy Beshear had declared a state of emergency ahead of the storms, which weather forecasters had anticipated could spark long-track tornadoes and high winds. Forecasters had designated West Kentucky as having the highest risk for severe weather, and first responders from the region on social media reported injuries and property damage from the storms. 
Ballard County Emergency Management in a Facebook post said four were injured and homes and structures were damaged from “what appears to have been a tornado” in the unincorporated community of Gage.

Rural hospital leaders are questioning whether they can continue to afford to do business with Medicare Advantage companies, and some say the only way to maintain services and protect patients is to end their contracts with the private insurers.
Medicare Advantage plans pay hospitals lower rates than traditional Medicare, said Jason Merkley, CEO of Brookings Health System in South Dakota. Merkley worried the losses would spark staff layoffs and cuts to patient services. So last year, Brookings Health dropped all four contracts it had with major Medicare Advantage companies.
“I’ve had lots of discussions with CEOs and executive teams across the country in regard to that,” said Merkley, whose health system operates a hospital and clinics in the small city of Brookings and surrounding rural areas.
Merkley and other rural hospital operators in recent years have enumerated a long list of concerns about the publicly funded, privately run health plans. In addition to the reimbursement issue, their complaints include payment delays and a resistance to authorizing patient care.
But rural hospitals abandoning their Medicare Advantage contracts can leave local patients without nearby in-network providers or force them to scramble to switch coverage.
Medicare is the main federal health insurance program for people 65 or older. Participants can enroll in traditional, government-run Medicare or in a Medicare Advantage plan run by a private insurance company.
In 2024, 56% of urban Medicare recipients were enrolled in a private plan, according to a report by the Medicare Payment Advisory Commission, a federal agency that advises Congress. While just 47% of rural recipients enrolled in a private plan, Medicare Advantage has expanded more quickly in rural areas.
In recent years, average Medicare Advantage reimbursements to rural hospitals were about 90% of what traditional Medicare paid, according to a new report from the American Hospital Association. And traditional Medicare already pays hospitals much less than private plans, according to a recent study by Rand Corp., a research nonprofit.
Carrie Cochran-McClain, chief policy officer at the National Rural Health Association, said Medicare Advantage is particularly challenging for small rural facilities designated critical access hospitals. Traditional Medicare pays such hospitals extra, but the private insurance companies aren’t required to do so.
“The vast majority of our rural hospitals are not in a position where they can take further cuts to payment,” Cochran-McClain said. “There are so many that are just really in a precarious financial spot.”
Nearly 200 rural hospitals have ended inpatient services or shuttered since 2005.
Mehmet Oz — doctor, former talk show host, and President Donald Trump’s nominee to lead the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services — has promoted and worked for the private Medicare industry and called for “Medicare Advantage for all.” But during his recent confirmation hearing, he called for more oversight as he acknowledged bipartisan concerns about the plans’ cost to taxpayers and their effect on patients.
Cochran-McClain said some Republican lawmakers want to address these issues while supporting Medicare Advantage.
“But I don’t think we’ve seen enough yet to really know what direction that’s all going to take,” she said.
Medicare Advantage plans can offer lower premiums and out-of-pocket costs for some participants. Nearly all offer extra benefits, such as vision, hearing, and dental coverage. Many also offer perks, such as gym memberships, nutrition services, and allowances for over-the-counter health supplies.
But a recent study in the Health Services Research journal found that rural patients on private plans struggled to access and afford care more often than rural enrollees on traditional Medicare and urban participants in both kinds of plans.
Susan Reilly, a spokesperson for the Better Medicare Alliance, said a recent report published by her group, which promotes Medicare Advantage, found that private plans are more affordable than traditional Medicare for rural beneficiaries. That analysis was conducted by an outside firm and based on a government survey of Medicare recipients.
Reilly also pointed to a study in The American Journal of Managed Care that found the growth of private plans in rural areas from 2008-2019 was associated with increased financial stability for hospitals and a reduced risk of closure.
Merkley said that’s not what he’s seeing on the ground in rural South Dakota.
He said traditional Medicare reimbursed Brookings Health System 91 cents for every dollar it spent on care in 2023, while Medicare Advantage plans paid 76 cents per dollar spent. He said his staff tried negotiating better contracts with the big Medicare Advantage companies, to no avail.
Patients who remain on private plans that no longer contract with their local hospitals and clinics may face higher prices unless they travel to in-network facilities, which in rural areas can be hours away. Merkley said most patients at Brookings Health switched to traditional Medicare or to regional Medicare Advantage plans that work better with the hospital system.
But switching from private to traditional Medicare can be unaffordable for patients.
That’s because in most states, Medigap plans — supplemental plans that help people on traditional Medicare cover out-of-pocket costs — can deny coverage or base their prices on patients’ medical history if they switch from a private plan.
Some rural health systems say they no longer work with any Medicare Advantage companies. They include Great Plains Health, which serves parts of rural Nebraska, Kansas, and Colorado, and Kimball Health Services, which is based in two small towns in Nebraska and Wyoming.
Medicare Advantage plans often limit the providers patients can see and require referrals and prior authorization for certain services. Requesting referrals, seeking preauthorization, and appealing denials can delay treatment for patients while adding extra work for doctors and billing staff.
“The unique rural lens on that is that rural providers really tend to be pretty bare-bone shops,” Cochran-McClain said. “That kind of administrative burden pulls people away from really being able to focus on providing quality care to their beneficiaries.”
Jonathon Green, CEO of Taylor Health Care Group in rural Georgia, said his system had to set up a team to deal solely with coverage denials, mostly from Medicare Advantage companies. He said some plans frequently decline to authorize payments before treatments, refuse to cover services they already approved, and deny payment for care that shouldn’t need approval.
In these cases, Green said, the companies argue that the care wasn’t appropriate for the patient.
“We hear that term constantly — ‘It’s not medically necessary,’” he said. “That’s the catchall for everything.”
Green said Taylor Health Care Group has considered dropping its Medicare Advantage contracts but is keeping them for now.
Cochran-McClain said her group supports policy changes, such as a federal bill that aims to streamline prior authorization while requiring Medicare Advantage companies to share data about the process. The 2024 bill was co-sponsored by more than half of U.S. senators, but needs to be reintroduced this year.
Cochran-McClain said rural-health advocates also want the government to require private plans to pay critical access hospitals and similar rural facilities as much as they would receive from traditional Medicare.
Green and Merkley stressed that they aren’t against the concept of private Medicare plans; they just want them to be fairer to rural facilities and patients.
Green said rural and independent hospitals don’t have the leverage that urban hospitals and large chains do in negotiations with giant Medicare Advantage companies.
“We just don’t have the ability to swing the pendulum enough,” he said.

Chris Pappas with supporters in Manchester on Tuesday, Nov. 5, 2024. (Photo by Will Steinfeld/New Hampshire Bulletin)Chris Pappas, a Democrat who has represented New Hampshire’s 1st Congressional District in the U.S. House of Representatives since winning election in 2018, announced Thursday that he’s running for U.S. Senate in 2026.
Pappas is the first to enter the race, and his announcement comes after Sen. Jeanne Shaheen announced in March she was vacating the seat, which she’s held for nearly two decades.  His campaign is beginning early in the cycle with Election Day still about 19 months away.
Pappas’ entrance to the race was widely anticipated by spectators, many of whom see him as a favorite to earn the Democratic nomination and possibly win a general election.
Pappas could face a competitive race in both the primary and general elections. New Hampshire’s other Democratic U.S. representative, Maggie Goodlander, who represents the state’s 2nd Congressional District, is also considering a run, her team previously told the Bulletin. On the Republican side, observers are waiting to see whether former Gov. Chris Sununu, who left office with high approval ratings but has been noncommittal about a Senate bid, will enter the race.
In a video announcing the campaign, Pappas touted his work in Congress over the past few years, attacked Republicans for attempting to give tax breaks to billionaires like Elon Musk, and emphasized his work at his family’s business. Notably absent in the video was any mention of President Donald Trump.
“What I hear from people?” he said. “They want someone who shows up, someone who listens, and someone who isn’t afraid to take on the big fights and more importantly today, who knows how to win them.”
A centrist, Pappas was ranked the most bipartisan Democrat in Congress in 2023 by the Lugar Center. Some of his most significant votes have come when he’s crossed the aisle to vote with Republicans. Early this year, he voted in favor of the Laken Riley Act, an immigration and law enforcement bill pushed by Republicans in the wake of the death of a Georgia teenager at the hands of an immigrant. That bill was widely criticized by progressives and immigration advocates who argued it disregards due process and gives too much power to state attorneys general, among other issues; they also point out that crimes by immigrants living in the country illegally are rare and that Riley’s tragic death was an outlier. Another example of Pappas crossing the aisle came in 2020 when he was one of six Democrats opposing the Marijuana Opportunity Reinvestment and Expungement Act — which unsuccessfully attempted to legalize marijuana federally — over concerns about a provision to expunge federal convictions.
Pappas is the first openly gay man to represent New Hampshire in Congress, and if elected he could become the first openly gay man to serve in the U.S. Senate. There is currently only one openly gay member of the Senate: Tammy Baldwin, a Wisconsin Democrat. Pappas’ husband, attorney Vann Bentley, is featured in his campaign announcement video.
Prior to becoming a congressman, Pappas served on the New Hampshire Executive Council from 2013 to 2019. He also served in the New Hampshire House of Representatives from 2002 to 2006.
The congressman just completed a listening tour of all 10 New Hampshire counties, where he openly mulled over a bid for the seat. His video released Thursday includes scenes from that tour. Pappas plans to hold an event at his family’s restaurant, The Puritan, later on Thursday to kick off his campaign.",https://newhampshirebulletin.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/pappasmanch-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-04-03 11:05:01.860204

(Photo by Andrew Harnik/Getty Images)Since President Donald Trump threatened to withhold federal funding unless Maine complies with his executive order banning transgender girls from playing girls’ sports, the state has been the subject of several probes and funding cuts that have been widely interpreted as retaliatory.
“We’re going to follow the law sir. We’ll see you in court,” Gov. Janet Mills told the president in a heated exchange while attending a White House event as part of the National Governors Association winter summit on Feb. 21. 
The Democrat was referring to the Maine Human Rights Act, which was amended in 2021 to include gender identity as a protected class against discrimination. Mills and Maine Attorney General Aaron Frey maintain that law supersedes the president’s edict. 
Mills warned in a statement later that day that the “rule of law in our country” is at stake and that the president will likely continue to target those who speak out against his wishes.
“Maine may be one of the first states to undergo an investigation by his administration, but we won’t be the last,” Mills said.
In the hours and weeks that followed, the federal government launched a series of investigations into Maine institutions. Below is a running list of the federal government’s actions against the state:

Pingree calls for acting Social Security director to step down over ‘vindictive actions’


By: Lauren McCauley - Thursday April 3, 2025 10:32 am












U.S. Rep. Chellie Pingree reiterated her call for Social Security Administration Acting Commissioner Leland Dudek to step down after leaked emails reported on by The Washington Post revealed that he deliberately sought to punish Maine after Gov. Janet Mills’ heated exchange with President Donald Trump over the state’s transgender protections.
On March 6, the Social Security Administration notified the Maine Department of Health and Human Services that it would be ending the “Enumeration at Birth” process, which allows parents to check a box on a form shortly after a child’s birth in order to receive a mailed Social Security card.
In a response to an emailed warning from a staff member that the change “would result in improper payments and potential for identity theft,” the acting director made clear that he acting in retaliation.
“While our improper payments will go up, and fraudsters may compromise identities, no money will go from the public trust to a petulant child,” he wrote. 
In a statement Wednesday, Pingree asked, “If a federal agency can be turned into a political hit squad at the whim of an acting appointee, what checks remain on executive power?”
“Commissioner Dudek’s vindictive actions against Maine represent a fundamental betrayal of public trust that disqualifies him from public service. He should not only resign or be removed from office; he should be investigated for his flagrant abuse of power.” 
By March 7, the agency had reversed course after Sens. Angus King and Susan Collins sought answers about the action. A spokesperson for Collins previously told Maine Morning Star that the Republican received a call from Dudek during which he claimed it was done in error.
When asked about the insult, Mills told reporters: “This is the same guy that admitted that he suspended Maine’s enumeration at birth and funeral directors’ program. First, he said it was a mistake, said it was inadvertent, then, God bless, Sen. King and Sen. Collins got after him and then he admitted he did it on purpose because the governor of Maine was not ‘sufficiently cordial to the president and I said, ‘I can’t speak to that.’”

USDA pausing funding to Maine school programs over alleged Title IX violations


By: Eesha Pendharkar - Wednesday April 2, 2025 5:35 pm












The U.S. Department of Agriculture is pausing federal funding for some school programs in response to Maine’s alleged violations of Title IX, though the agency has not conducted a formal investigation.
“You cannot openly violate federal law against discrimination in education and expect federal funding to continue unabated,” USDA Secretary Brooke Rollins wrote in a letter to Gov. Janet Mills on Wednesday. “Today, I am freezing Maine’s federal funds for certain administrative and technological functions in schools.
“This is only the beginning,” the letter warned.
School lunch programs, which are funded by the USDA, will not be impacted by the freeze, Rollins said. However, the agency is “reviewing all research and education-related funding in Maine” for compliance with federal anti-discrimination laws “and the priorities of the Trump administration.”
For Maine to continue receiving funding, the state will have to “demonstrate compliance with Title IX’s protection of female student athletes from having to compete with or against or having to appear unclothed before males,” Rollins’ letter said.

Title IX case against Maine schools headed to U.S. Department of Justice


By: Eesha Pendharkar - Tuesday April 1, 2025 4:14 pm












The U.S. Department of Education’s Office for Civil Rights issued a final warning Monday to the Maine Department of Education regarding its noncompliance with a federal directive for allowing trans girls to participate in girls’ sports.
If the state does not propose an agreement that’s acceptable to the office by April 11, the case will be referred to the Department of Justice, the letter said.
Meanwhile, a separate investigation by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services’ civil rights office that found Maine in violation of Title IX for “continuing to unlawfully allow” trans girls to compete in girl’s sports has been referred to the U.S. Department of Justice, according to a Monday social media post from the agency.

Federal probe targets Maine school gender policies, citing parental rights


By: Eesha Pendharkar - Friday March 28, 2025 5:12 pm












District policies that protect students’ privacy when it comes to gender identity might be violating federal law by depriving parents of information, according to the U.S. Department of Education.
In another directed investigation launched by the department based on reports from right-wing media about Maine districts complying with the Maine Human Rights Act, the department alleged that by developing plans to affirm students’ gender, districts may be in violation of the Family Educational Rights Privacy Act (FERPA).
In a letter dated March 28 to the Maine Department of Education, Frank Miller, acting director for the Student Privacy Policy Office, highlighted a 2016 memo by the Maine Human Rights Commission that explains the interpretation of the Act: “In the event that the student and their parent/legal guardian do not agree with regard to the student’s sexual orientation, gender identity, or gender expression, the educational institution should, whenever possible, abide by the wishes of the student with regard to their gender identity and expression while at school,” the memo states.
“The overall memorandum on its face appears to give school officials discretion that would infringe on the rights of a parent under FERPA,” Miller said in his letter.
He also alleged that “this same rhetoric may lead to Title IX violations if applied in a school environment,” which may warrant the investigation to be referred to the OCR.

Gov. Mills responds to Trump’s demand for apology


By: Lauren McCauley - Monday March 24, 2025 12:49 pm












Gov. Janet Mills responded to President Donald Trump’s demand that she apologize after the Democrat refused to capitulate to an executive order banning transgender girls from student athletics.
“I don’t communicate with public officials by tweet or Instagram or social media,” Mills told reporters, referring to Trump’s weekend post on Truth Social, at a Monday event celebrating the purchase of Bangor mobile home park by its residents.
“Second, all of my issues are about the rule of law pure and simple,” she continued. “It’s not about transgender sports, it is about who makes the laws and who enforces the laws. I read the constitution. Constitution says the president, the chief executive, shall take care that the law be faithfully executed. It doesn’t allow him to make laws out of whole cloth by tweet or Instagram post or press release or executive order that is fundamental law, and I stand for the rule of law and the separation of powers.”
Without naming Trump, Mills went on to say that “if the current occupant of the White House wants to protect women and girls, he should start by protecting the women and teenage girls who are suffering miscarriages and dying because they can’t get basic, life-saving health care in states across this country,” according to the Bangor Daily News.
She added that people in Maine are waiting for an economic plan. “We’ve seen tariffs and threat of tariffs that threaten our economy here in Maine and across the country.”
Last week, the U.S. Department of Education notified Maine that its Department of Education was found in violation of Title IX, a federal civil rights rule that bans sex-based discrimination in schools, giving the state 10 days to comply. Maine is expected to respond with legal action.

Trump demands Gov. Mills give ‘full-throated apology’


By: Lauren McCauley -  9:14 am












In a post to his Truth Social account early Saturday, President Donald Trump demanded a “full-throated apology” from Gov. Janet Mills, following her refusal to cave to his administration’s order to ban transgender girls from girls sports.
Maine public schools follow the Maine Human Rights Act, which was amended in 2021 to include gender identity as a protected class against discrimination.
The Republican president also incorrectly claimed that the state has issued an apology for its policy — something that was swiftly rebutted by Maine Secretary of State Shenna Bellows, who wrote that, as the “official keeper of all state records and guardian of the seal,” she “can confirm ‘State of Maine’ hasn’t apologized.”
Here’s Trump’s full post:
“While the State of Maine has apologized for their Governor’s strong, but totally incorrect, statement about men playing in women’s sports while at the White House Governor’s Conference, we have not heard from the Governor herself, and she is the one that matters in such cases. Therefore, we need a full-throated apology from the Governor herself, and a statement that she will never make such an unlawful challenge to the Federal Government again, before this case can be settled. I’m sure she will be able to do that quite easily. Thank you for your attention to this matter and, MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!!! DJT”

U.S. Department of Education determines Maine guilty of violating Title IX


By: Lauren McCauley - Thursday March 20, 2025 10:04 am












The U.S. Department of Education notified Maine late Wednesday that its Department of Education was found in violation of a federal civil rights rule that bans sex-based discrimination in schools.
The letter, addressed to Maine Education Commissioner Pender Makin from the U.S. DOE Office for Civil Rights, said the determination is based on state and district policies that permit transgender girls from participating in girls’ sports. It gives the state ten days to comply with President Donald Trump’s executive order banning transgender girls from playing girls’ sports.
Maine public schools follow the Maine Human Rights Act, which was amended in 2021 to include gender identity as a protected class against discrimination. Title IX, the federal law banning sex-based discrimination does not reference trans people directly, but the Trump administration is interpreting Maine’s policy as discrimination against cisgender girls.



This finding is the latest among several federal probes launched against the state following a clash between Gov. Janet Mills and Trump over trans inclusion in girls’ sports.

USDA deems University of Maine System to be in compliance with Title IX


By: Eesha Pendharkar - Wednesday March 19, 2025 5:32 pm












Though the University of Maine System was officially cleared by the U.S. Department of Agriculture of any violations of Title IX, Chancellor Dannel Malloy said the system had been in compliance the entire time, having previously called the probe “an unnecessary distraction.”
UMS follows National Collegiate Athletic Association rules, which were updated last month to ban trans women from women’s sports after President Donald Trump issued an executive order banning transgender girls from playing girls’ sport.
The USDA investigation was among several launched last month as part of federal scrutiny of Maine’s education policies, stemming from a clash between Gov. Janet Mills and Trump over trans inclusion in girls’ sports. USDA froze funds to the university system last week for potential Title IX and Title IV violations, which ban sex and race-based discrimination respectively. After Sen. Susan Collins reportedly intervened with the Trump administration, funding to UMS was restored.
On Wednesday, USDA concluded its compliance review in a news release saying that the university system was in compliance but also warning the rest of the state to follow suit or risk losing funding.
“UMaine’s decision to side with sanity is a win for women and girls in Maine,” the release said. “The choice for the rest of Maine is simple: protect equal opportunities for women, as required by law, or lose funding.”

Trump administration says Maine Principals’ Association, high school violating Title IX


By: Emma Davis - Monday March 17, 2025 7:46 pm












The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services Office for Civil Rights announced on Monday that it determined the Maine Principals’ Association and Greely High School in Cumberland are each in violation of Title IX for allowing transgender girls to compete in girls’ sports.
On Feb. 21, DHHS issued a notice of violation against the Maine Department of Education for violating that same federal civil rights law, which bans sex-based discrimination in schools and colleges, and on March 5 expanded the compliance review to MPA, which governs sports in Maine, and Greely High School.
According to DHHS, the entities can “voluntarily commit within 10 days to resolve the matter through a signed agreement or risk referral to the U.S. Department of Justice for appropriate action.”   The full agreement, obtained by the Bangor Daily News, can be read here.

USDA backtracks on university funding halt


By: Lauren McCauley - Thursday March 13, 2025 12:30 pm












Two days after the U.S. Department of Agriculture announced it would be halting funds to the University of Maine System while it continues its Title IX compliance review, the agency backtracked.
In a statement, Sen. Susan Collins said after consulting with the Trump administration she was alerted that the funding had been restored.
“This USDA funding is critically important not only to the University of Maine, but to our farmers and loggers, as well as to the many people who work in Maine’s agriculture, aquaculture, and forestry industries,” Collins said. “Now that funding has been restored, the work that the University does in partnership with the many people and communities who depend on these programs can continue.”

Amid probe, U.S. Department of Agriculture halts funding to Maine university system


By: Eesha Pendharkar -  12:30 pm












On March 10, just over two weeks after the U.S. Department of Agriculture announced an investigation into the University of Maine System, school leaders received a forwarded email from USDA’s Office of the Chief Financial Officer apparently ordering a temporary pause in funding for the system while the agency evaluates whether it should take any follow-up actions to “prospective Title VI or Title IX violations,” according to a news release from the university system.
“Please take any necessary actions to effectuate this direction from leadership. This pause will remain in effect until further notice,” the USDA email said.
Last fiscal year, USDA awarded $29.78 million to UMaine for research on a wide variety of agriculture innovations and environmental issues, including PFAS contamination on Maine farms, sustainable packaging materials derived from Maine forest-based materials, potato breeding and varietal development, sustainable lobster fishing and support for 4-H youth leadership and STEM skill development programs, which serve tens of thousands of Maine youth every year. 
The University of Southern Maine also has several active USDA awards. 
The state’s public universities are members of the National Collegiate Athletic Association, which banned trans women from women’s sports following Trump’s executive order, and are “operating in a manner entirely consistent with that association’s recently updated policies,” university spokesperson Samantha Warren said.
That means that the funding was halted despite the fact that the system can’t allow trans women to compete on women’s teams.

Social Security snafu puts state on edge


By: Lauren McCauley -  12:29 pm












Another incident that was initially thought to be retaliatory but later deemed an “error” had state officials on edge. 
On March 6, the Portland Press Herald reported that Maine Department of Health and Human Services had been notified by the Social Security Administration that it would be ending the “Enumeration at Birth” process, which allows parents to check a box on a form shortly after a child’s birth in order to receive a mailed Social Security card.
The state agency sent an email to birth certifiers on March 5 alerting them of the change, “effective immediately.”
By March 7, the agency had reversed course while Sens. Angus King and Susan Collins asked for a briefing “to explain why this decision was made at the start.”
A spokesperson for Collins told Maine Morning Star that the Republican did receive a call from Social Security Acting Commissioner Leland Dudek during which he explained it was done in error and let her know it was fully reversed.

Maine Sea Grant to be renegotiated


By: AnnMarie Hilton -  12:28 pm












Less than one week after the University of Maine System was notified that funding for the Maine Sea Grant program had been cut, the U.S. Department of Commerce said on March 5 it would “reopen bilateral negotiations” after appeals from members of Maine’s congressional delegation.
Vice Admiral Nancy Hann credited Republican Sen. Susan Collins’ outreach to Secretary of Commerce Howard Lutnick. Independent Sen. Angus King and Rep. Chellie Pingree also sent a letter to Lutnick demanding he immediately reverse the “reckless decision” to terminate the federal grant.

Maine Sea Grant funding cut

The University of Maine said it was notified late Feb. 28 that the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration was immediately discontinuing funding for the $4.5 million Maine Sea Grant, according to university spokesperson Samantha Warren. 
The grant has helped finance statewide research, strengthened coastal communities and supported thousands of jobs over more than five decades. 
The Maine Sea Grant fosters coastal workforce development, hands-on marine science education for students of all grade levels, research to inform lobster and other fisheries management, as well as storm preparedness for working waterfronts. 
It has supported thousands of jobs over more than five decades, including 20 current university employees, according to Warren, who said that every federal dollar spent on the program results in $15 of economic activity in the state, amounting to a total annual impact of $23.5 million.
However, the letter from NOAA said the grant’s work is “no longer relevant to the focus of the Administration’s priorities and program objectives.”
Maine’s Sea Grant program is one of 34 across coastal and Great Lakes states throughout the country. However, it appears to have been the only one cut.

U.S. Department of Justice threatens to sue Maine


By: Maine Morning Star -  12:27 pm












In a letter to Mills dated Feb. 25, U.S. Attorney General Pam Bondi threatened to sue the state if federal investigations show that “relevant Maine entities are indeed denying girls an equal opportunity to participate in sports and athletic events by requiring them to compete against” trans girls. 
“Maine should be on notice,” Bondi warned, adding that “the Department of Justice stands ready to take all appropriate action to enforce federal law,” referring to the Trump administration’s interpretation of TItle IX.

U.S. Department of Health and Human Services determines Maine guilty of Title IX violation


By: Eesha Pendharkar -  12:26 pm












On Feb. 25, the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services issued a notice of violation against the Maine Department of Education for violating Title IX. 
Concluding just four days after it was launched, the investigation included no interviews, data requests or negotiations, according to the Maine Attorney General’s Office, which was notified by the agency via emailed letter that the state had violated Title IX, the federal law banning sex-based discrimination in schools and colleges. The letter also handed the case over to the U.S. Department of Justice —  a rare outcome for such a probe.
The lack of process followed by the agency’s Office for Civil Rights (OCR) defies decades of precedent, according to Jackie Wernz, a former OCR lawyer for the U.S. Department of Education who now represents schools nationwide in such cases. Within any federal agency, the OCR typically conducts lengthy investigations with fact-finding, interviews and legal analysis of how exactly the agency under investigation violated federal laws the office is tasked with upholding, including Title IX.
But in this case, OCR simply appears to be enforcing the Trump administration’s stance on trans athletes, according to Wernz. 
If Maine does not sue or comply, the department could withhold funds from the state as soon as 10 days after the notice, which was sent on Feb. 25. While the letter does not go into detail about the exact amount of funding that could be withheld, Maine received more than $700,000 from HHS in 2024.

U.S. Department of Agriculture Title IX review


By: Lauren McCauley -  12:26 pm












On Feb. 22, the U.S. Department of Agriculture notified Maine Gov. Janet Mills and University of Maine System Chancellor Dannel Malloy that it had also launched a Title IX review. 
As a land grant university, the University of Maine System receives funding from the agency’s Agricultural Research Service and National Institute of Food and Agriculture, which in recent years totaled over $100 million, according to USDA Acting General Counsel Ralph Linden. 
“Should the University of Maine or other entities receiving funds from USDA be found to be out of compliance, additional funding may be in jeopardy,” Linden wrote.

U.S. Department of Health and Human Services Title IX investigation


By: Lauren McCauley -  12:25 pm












On Feb. 21, the same day that the U.S. Department of Education announced its investigation into Maine, the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services’ civil rights division quickly followed suit. 
The agency said it was initiating a compliance review of the Maine Department of Education, including the University of Maine System, “based on information that Maine intends to defy” the president’s executive order on transgender athletes.
“The investigation will examine whether the State of Maine engaged in discrimination on the basis of sex under Title IX of the Education Amendments of 1972, as amended, and its HHS implementing regulation,” the announcement read.

U.S. Department of Education Title IX review


By: Lauren McCauley -  12:24 pm












Hours after Mills and Trump traded barbs, the U.S. Department of Education’s Office for Civil Rights announced it was launching a Title IX investigation into the Maine Department of Education as well as Maine School Administrative District 51, which is based in Cumberland, in response to reports that Greely High School is “continuing to allow at least one male student to compete in girls’ categories.”
The agency is arguing that Maine schools’ adherence to the protections in the Maine Human Rights Act is in violation of Title IX, which prohibits sex-based discrimination in any school or any other education program that receives federal funding.
In response, Mills issued a statement saying the effort to “withhold federal funding authorized and appropriated by Congress and paid for by Maine taxpayers in an attempt to coerce someone into compliance with his will” is “a violation of our Constitution and of our laws, which I took an oath to uphold.”",https://mainemorningstar.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/donaldtrumpfeb112025_0-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-04-03 11:05:01.860204

(Justin Sullivan/Getty Images)Under an emerging Republican plan to require some Medicaid recipients to work, between 4.6 million and 5.2 million adults ages 19 to 55 could lose their health care coverage, according to a new analysis.
The study, conducted by Urban Institute researchers with support from the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation, calculated that up to 39% of the 13.3 million adults in that age group who became eligible for Medicaid when their states expanded the program under the Affordable Care Act would lose coverage if Congress required states to impose work rules.
The report suggests that most of those people would lose coverage not because they aren’t complying with the rules, but because they would struggle to report their compliance to the state.
“Most adults who would lose eligibility for federal Medicaid funding are working, engaged in work-related activities, or could qualify for exemptions not readily identifiable through state databases but could still face disenrollment because of the reporting requirements,” it states. The study identified several barriers to reporting, including lack of broadband access and lack of transportation.
Forty states plus the District of Columbia have expanded Medicaid under the ACA. Overall, nearly 72 million people, about a fifth of Americans, are enrolled in the program for low-income people, which is funded jointly by the federal government and the states.
The two-year budget was ‘not the last word.’ Here’s what comes next.

Traditional Medicaid insurance was mainly available to children and their caregivers, people with disabilities and pregnant women. But the ACA, commonly known as Obamacare, allowed states to extend coverage to adults making up to 138% of the federal poverty level — about $21,000 a year for a single person.
Nationwide, more than 21 million people with low incomes have health insurance because of expanded Medicaid eligibility.
U.S. House Republicans in February pushed through a budget plan, now under consideration in the Senate, that would require about $880 billion in cuts to Medicaid over the next decade to help cover the cost of $4.5 trillion in tax cuts. The budget doesn’t contain specifics on how that target would be met. But work requirements are a likely money-saving option: A 2023 analysis from the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office found that imposing work rules on Medicaid recipients ages 19 to 55 who are not parents or caregivers would cut federal spending by an estimated $109 billion over the next 10 years.
The Congressional Budget Office based that projection on a plan the GOP-controlled U.S. House approved in 2023. That bill, the likely blueprint for the work requirements Republicans are considering now, would have required adults ages 19-55 to work, participate in a job training program or perform community service for at least 80 hours per month for three or more months in a calendar year. Parents and caretakers of dependent children, and those unable to work because of a health condition, would have been exempt.
Many Republican-led states are eager to impose work requirements on able-bodied Medicaid recipients. Thirteen states, including Maine, received permission to impose work rules on at least some Medicaid enrollees during the first Trump administration. Nine additional states requested permission to enact Medicaid work requirements during Trump’s earlier term but had not won approval by the time it ended.
When the Biden administration came into office, it rescinded all the approvals.
Supporters say requiring Medicaid recipients to work, study or train for a career gives them a boost toward self-sufficiency and financial stability. Critics, however, say such rules end up hurting far more people than they help.
The most likely Medicaid cuts would hit rural areas the hardest

The researchers from the Urban Institute mostly based their analysis on the experience of Arkansas, which in June 2018 became the first state to require some Medicaid recipients to work, volunteer, go to school or participate in job training to receive benefits. By the time a federal judge halted the policy in April 2019, 18,000 adults had lost coverage.
The researchers also looked at New Hampshire, which began implementing a work requirement but halted the program in July 2019 before suspending anyone’s coverage.
“What was found in a lot of qualitative research on the previous work requirement programs is that a lot of people were unaware of the policy, or they didn’t understand the policy,” said Michael Karpman, an Urban Institute researcher who co-authored the study.
“People who need coverage the most would do the most to try to maintain it. On the other hand, those people could also face the most difficulty with the administrative barriers,” Karpman said.
In a 2020 study examining how Arkansas’ last experience with work requirements played out, researchers from the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health “found no evidence that the policy succeeded in its stated goal of promoting work and instead found substantial evidence of harm to health care coverage and access.”
Arkansas Republican Gov. Sarah Huckabee Sanders announced in January that she would ask the federal government for permission to institute work requirements, regardless of what Congress decides. The state submitted the request last week.










Especially for a rural state like Arkansas, work requirements fail to take into account a lot of the realities that people may face. 


– Christin Harper, policy director for Arkansas Advocates for Children and Families


Arkansas Republican state Rep. Aaron Pilkington, who serves on the health committee in his chamber, said lawmakers “learned our lesson from the last go-round.”
Pilkington said that under the new proposal, the state will only pause coverage instead of canceling it, giving recipients an opportunity to prove they are complying. And, he said, the online portal for reporting will be a lot more user-friendly.
“I think it’s a reasonable thing to ask for able-bodied people to look for work, or try to obtain work,” Pilkington said.
But Christin Harper, policy director for Arkansas Advocates for Children and Families, said even the new version would be a challenge for many enrollees. Many people on Medicaid are juggling multiple jobs, and having to report to the state every month would be a significant burden.
“Especially for a rural state like Arkansas, work requirements fail to take into account a lot of the realities that people may face,” Harper said. She added that “with the overall job market, job opportunities may or may not be available in some of these rural towns.”

(Photo by James Brooks/Alaska Beacon)A bill that advanced in the Alaska Senate on Wednesday would provide a $1,000 per-student boost to the state’s school funding formula. It also would limit class sizes and tie funding for homeschooling to students being assessed through a standardized test or portfolio. 
The Senate Education Committee introduced and quickly voted in favor of its own version of House Bill 69, which the lower chamber passed earlier this month. It added several policy changes.
Sen. Löki Tobin, D-Anchorage and the committee chair, said in an interview before introducing the committee version that she hoped the legislation “showcases that we want to find common ground, that we want to build a better Alaska together.”
Mike Mason, an aide for Tobin, began a presentation on the bill by saying that Alaska schools are in crisis. 
“Funding has not kept up with inflation,” he said. “Simultaneously, there’s a nationwide shortage of teachers and other education professionals as a state. It looks like we are shortchanging the future academic and economic success of our children by not funding our schools to thrive.”
Mason described some of the key additions to the legislation, which originated as a measure to increase the core of the funding formula, known as the base student allocation.  
“It retains the heart of House Bill 69 that is the $1,000 BSA increase,” Mason said. “The BSA supports all forms of public education, that includes charter schools, the home school component …. It will allow schools to have better programs. In many cases, it will even allow schools to have smaller class sizes.”
Class sizes are addressed in the committee version with the new maximum class sizes, to curb overcrowding. The bill allows districts to exclude elective classes and mixed-grade classes from these caps. The target average maximum class size for each grade from prekindergarten through sixth grade would be 23 students, and the targeted cap for grades 7 through 12 would be 30 students. 
If districts cannot stay at or below the maximum class sizes, they would be required to report to the state why they’re unable to meet the limits and how they plan to meet them in the future. “And then districts that are unable to meet their grade level targets would be eligible for some grant funding,” Mason said.
The bill also expands open enrollment across districts statewide, allowing families to enroll students in the public school of their choice, with some exceptions and provisions for neighborhood schools. “For instance, school districts are allowed to make policies that include a preference for siblings and children of employees of the school. Districts can also give preference to military families, and the capacity of a school would be determined by the local school board,” Mason said.
The legislation also included provisions to boost career and technical training opportunities, and a new task force on education funding to help find ways to lower costs, such as insurance and school maintenance.
Another provision would attach homeschool allotment funding to students participating in standardized testing, including “state standards-based assessment, alternative assessment, or provide a student portfolio based on criteria established by DEED.”
Sen. Jesse Bjorkman, R-Nikiski, introduced an amendment Wednesday to allow that provision to start next year, which was adopted unanimously. 
“I want to make sure that people have time to adjust. And certainly no homeschooler should go without an allotment that is expecting it for next school year,” he said.
The amended bill was unanimously moved by the four committee members present on Wednesday, with Sen. Mike Cronk, R-Tok, excused. It is on track to go to the Senate Finance Committee next week. 
The price tag for HB 69 is estimated at $253 million added to per student funding, plus $22 million for the state’s reading program, according to the legislative budget analysts, to total $275 million. 
If there are additional costs for the committee’s bill, they will be presented to the finance committee, according to Mason. 
Tobin said Wednesday morning that she is confident in legislators being able to fund major priorities, including education. She rejected pitting the Permanent Fund dividend amount against school funding. 
“I think it is a false choice between having x and getting y,” she said. “I think once we put all the great minds in this building together, we can actually build a system that puts resources where they’re desperately needed into our state systems …. We can do it all.”

The Nansemond Indian Nation is accusing the state of Virginia of undermining its sovereign rights and violating federal law by refusing to pay out $1.7 million in Medicaid claims.
The tribe alleges in a new federal lawsuit that state agencies and officials are trying to shift the blame for Virginia’s financial mistakes and coerce Fishing Point Healthcare, a clinic operated by the tribe, into a new structure to compete less with other private providers.
“Rather than partnering with a federally recognized Tribal Nation to improve health-care access for low-income families and stabilize Virginia’s own faltering healthcare infrastructure, Virginia officials have instead weaponized the Commonwealth’s administrative machinery to punish a Tribal Health Program that dared to step into the breach,” reads the lawsuit, which was filed Tuesday.
The filing says Virginia appears to have thought Fishing Point would only be serving tribal members. The suit says state agencies likely claimed an incorrect amount for Medicaid payments for non-Native American patients than allowed, “thereby creating a substantial risk that the federal government would reclaim millions of dollars from” the state.
The tribe says the state argued after the fact that some of the services Fishing Point was providing were not authorized for Medicaid reimbursement “so they could shift any repayment obligation” onto the Nansemond.
The state also pushed the tribe to rework its clinic structure, away from the federally-recognized Tribal Health Program and to a model similar to private companies contracted with the state. The tribe argues the state’s pressure was intended to limit Fishing Point’s competition with other private providers.
The filing alleges the state has refused to pay out any Medicaid reimbursements for some services since October, and as of March 31stall of Fishing Point’s Medicaid claims were frozen – a total of 7,650 worth about $1.7 million – “thereby weaponizing the billing process to coerce Plaintiffs into capitulating to Defendants’ demands.”
Efforts to reach Virginia’s Department of Medical Assistance Services, which manages Medicaid in the state and is named as one of the defendants in the filing, received no response Wednesday.
Fishing Point says it’s continuing to provide care to both tribal members and non-Native American patients, but the funding freeze “represents a financial chokehold that threatens to cripple Fishing Point’s ability to sustain operations,” according to the lawsuit.
The Suffolk-based tribe started Fishing Point Healthcare in 2023, five years after it was federally recognized. Federal recognition allows tribal nations to provide health care to its members and serve anyone using federal healthcare assistance like Medicaid.
The system started with a clinic in Portsmouth and Fishing point just opened its second clinic in Newport News. Fishing Point CEO Lance Johnson told WHRO earlier this year the health system has plans for expansion to other cities over the next few years, including a Norfolk clinic already in the works.

Pete Ricketts in the midterms.  
The former Omaha labor leader’s announcement of a second possible Senate run comes after his populist bid against U.S. Sen. Deb Fischer, R-Neb., in 2024 made national headlines for turning an expected safe race into a potential upset. He attracted an extraordinary fundraising haul for a nonpartisan federal candidate in Nebraska of $14 million, including some late money from the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee once they saw his momentum. He lost by about six percentage points.

Osborn told the Nebraska Examiner last month that he had expanded his scope for his next political office run last month after initially thinking about running against Republican U.S. Rep. Don Bacon in the Omaha-based 2nd District or running for governor against GOP Gov. Jim Pillen. 
The steamfitter who made his name by leading the Kellogg’s strike in Omaha in 2021 and made waves by choosing to pay himself in 2024 with campaign funds chose the race that offered the clearest contrast.
“Multi-billionaire Pete Ricketts is Nebraska’s other Senator. He’s up next year,” Osborn said. “We could replace a billionaire with a mechanic.” 
Ricketts served two terms as governor before Pillen. He was the most established figure in the Nebraska Republican Party until some in the party’s base revolted against the leadership team loyal to Ricketts. As the eldest son of a billionaire businessman who founded TD Ameritrade and whose family now owns the Chicago Cubs, Ricketts has a significant political war chest and has used his own money to influence Nebraska politics.
Populism’s rise
But populism, whether Osborn’s approach or Trump’s, is the driving force in modern politics, as voters lose faith in institutions and seek alternatives. The same working-class-focused rhetoric that drove President Donald Trump’s victory gives someone like Osborn an opening. 
Typical political wisdom would suggest risk to the incumbent party during midterm elections, which could help Osborn, but Democrats bucked that trend and gained a firmer grip in the Senate in 2022. 
After losing to Fischer, Osborn launched a political action committee to support working-class candidates and encourage more “plumbers, carpenters, teachers, nurses and factory workers to run for office.” 
While populism is on Osborn’s side, Ricketts has the dominant political operation in the state. Republicans who crossed him have lost seats, and his endorsement holds weight. His endorsed candidate for governor, Pillen, defeated a Trump-endorsed candidate in 2022, Charles Herbster.
“Even Chuck Schumer’s $4 million wasn’t enough to sell Nebraskans on Dan Osborn being anything other than a liberal Democrat,” a political spokeswoman for Ricketts said. “Voters will reject Dan Osborn again because they know he will oppose the America First agenda and side with the coastal elites bankrolling his campaigns.”
Partisan questions
Nebraska Republicans, including Fischer, have called Osborn a Democrat in sheep’s clothing. Several joked Thursday about him tweeting a fundraising link from ActBlue, a key fundraising tool of used by many Democrats.
Osborn said on the podcast of his former campaign manager, the Dan Parsons Show, that he did not want to play spoiler in a potential three-way race in the 2nd District. Democrats haven’t yet announced a candidate for the congressional district, but have signaled they will. The potentially crowded 2nd District field contributed to Osborn choosing a different path. 
“It is our job to build the Democratic Party, and we are focused on doing that while creating alliances with candidates like Dan when it is the best path for Nebraskans,” Jane Kleeb, chair of the Nebraska Democratic Party, said last month. 
Republicans have almost completely taken over America’s heartland, a region once known for its prairie progressivism. If Osborn were able to unseat any of Nebraska’s federal delegation, it would be the first time a non-Republican had represented Nebraska in Congress since Democratic U.S. Rep. Brad Ashford upset Republican U.S. Rep. Lee Terry in the 2nd District in 2014. 
The last non-Republican governor was Ben Nelson in the late 1990s.  
“We could have a chance to win,” Osborn said. “We could take on this illness, the billionaire class, directly.”

(File photo by Travis Bell/STATEHOUSE CAROLINA/Special to the SC Daily Gazette)COLUMBIA — As she mulls a 2026 gubernatorial bid, South Carolina’s lieutenant governor says her decision is guided by a desire to build on the state’s economic growth under Gov. Henry McMaster using her own business experience.
Pam Evette has served alongside McMaster since the 2018 election, the first in the state with candidates for governor and lieutenant governor running on the same ticket. McMaster, the state’s oldest and longest-serving elected governor in state history, can’t run again.
“That plays a factor in this, making sure that legacy continues on, so I’m seriously considering (running),” Evette told the SC Daily Gazette on Wednesday.
She did not give a timeline for a decision.
Evette, who joined McMaster’s team as his running mate in November 2017, said the accomplishments she’s proud of include using the governor’s bully pulpit to promote the career paths available to students through the state’s technical colleges.
Her roles have included leading South Carolina’s 2020 Complete Count Committee, which had the unexpected task of getting an official tally of residents amid a pandemic.
The 57-year-old accountant will be aided by the political action committee Patriots for South Carolina. Made up of allies of President Donald Trump, the PAC has already secured $5 million dollars in donor commitments for Evette, The Post and Courier first reported.
It’s a boost she’ll need to stand out among an expectedly crowded field for the Republican nomination. Despite her travels across the state as the governor’s ambassador and her frequent appearances beside McMaster at news conferences, Evette is an unknown to many voters, as shown by the latest Winthrop Poll.
Although no one is officially in the race, Republicans considering a bid include Attorney General Alan Wilson, U.S. Reps. Nancy Mace and Ralph Norman, and state Sens. Sean Bennett and Josh Kimbrell.
Unlike any of them, Evette’s bid for governor would be her first solo run for elected office.
Mace, who constituents criticized for not attending a town hall in her district last Friday, was at the Statehouse on Wednesday and told reporters “things are looking very positive” for her decision on a gubernatorial announcement. She added that she was meeting with House Speaker Murrell Smith, R-Sumter, about the “future of the state.”
The First District congresswoman has made repeated jabs at Evette on social media.
However, the lieutenant governor said the comments don’t bother her much.
“That’s what you see in Washington (D.C.) politics, and that’s why we are where we are in Washington with an unbalanced budget and things not getting done,” Evette said.
One question is who in the potential field might get Trump’s endorsement. In January, Mace told reporters that Trump’s opinion on her potential run would be a crucial factor in her decision.
Evette said she’s not relying on his endorsement, though she called Trump an inspiration. She’s described herself as a “Trump girl” since 2017. It was at a reception in Washington, D.C., for Trump’s inauguration where she first met McMaster.
Last week, Evette traveled to Washington at the invitation of the White House for an event celebrating Women’s History Month. Mace was also among attendees.
‘Time is money’
Originally from Ohio, Evette moved to South Carolina two decades ago and made the Palmetto State her adopted home, she said. It’s where she raised her three children and grew her business.
When McMaster picked Evette, the political novice was the president and CEO of Quality Business Solutions, an outsourcing payroll and human resources firm operating out of Travelers Rest for clients nationwide. (Her husband became president when she joined McMaster’s team.)
Her business credentials and desire to cut bureaucratic red tape remain the key component of her potential sales pitch to voters.
During her conversation with the SC Daily Gazette, Evette said she’d want to put her “own stamp” on the state with a company-like approach to the governor’s office.
Sounding a lot like former Gov. Nikki Haley, who also had an accounting background and crafted her reputation as the “jobs governor,” Evette said she’d focus on making South Carolina the most business-friendly state in the nation — if she were to run, of course.
As a former business owner, now equipped with more than six years in office, Evette says she has a unique understanding of how to help the state’s business community.

[&#8230;]","Democratic Assemblymember Selena La Rue Hatch during a hearing on paid family and medical leave. (Legislative stream screengrab)Nevada lawmakers are considering vastly expanding access to  paid family and medical leave, though the proposal faces harsh opposition from business and industry groups.
Democratic Assemblymember Selena La Rue Hatch’s Assembly Bill 388 would require private employers with more than 50 workers, as well as all public employers, to provide paid family and medical leave. The bill was heard by the Assembly Committee on Revenue on Wednesday.
Only 4% of businesses employ more than 50 workers, according to La Rue Hatch, who attributed the figure to research by the Legislative Counsel Bureau, but that 4% of businesses employ nearly 1 million Nevadans — more than 60% of the state’s workforce.
In 2023, the Legislature established paid family and medical leave for state employees. La Rue Hatch described this year’s AB388,  as “a natural next step” to ensure nearly a million Nevadans are able to address their own and their family’s medical needs. Twelve assemblymembers and one state senator have signed on as additional sponsors.
La Rue Hatch, a public school teacher in Northern Nevada, shared with the committee that in November she had jaw surgery that required six weeks of recovery. Public school teachers are not covered by the state’s existing mandated paid family and medical leave law, so she relied on a union-negotiated program where members can donate their paid time off to others who need it.
Most Nevada workers don’t have access to an option like that, she added, and instead are left with options that lead to financial hardship. They return to work prematurely after giving birth, leave the workforce entirely to provide unpaid care to elderly parents, wrack up additional debt during extensive cancer treatments, or forgo needed medical procedures because they know they can’t afford not to work while recovering.
The United States is one of only six countries that does not have a national guaranteed, comprehensive paid leave program.
Thirteen states have comprehensive, mandatory state paid family and medical leave. Most offer the benefit through pooled payroll taxes paid by employers and/or employees, according to the Bipartisan Policy Center.
La Rue Hatch told the committee she didn’t believe Nevada was open to that approach.
Under her bill, Nevada employers would be required to offer it as a benefit after 90 days of employment. The leave would be available for specific purposes, such as the birth or adoption of a child, treatment of a serious illness, or caring for a family member who is seriously ill. There are also specific provisions for victims of domestic abuse and families dealing with military deployment.
Workers who earn  up to 110% of the state’s average weekly wage — about $1,200 per week or $57,000 annually — would receive 100% of their paycheck for up to 12 weeks. Workers who earn more than that would receive 60% of their wage or 60% of 150% of the state’s average weekly wage, whichever is less. (That 150% threshold currently translates to workers who make about $1,600 a week or $78,000 annually.)
La Rue Hatch said the sliding scale and cap acknowledges that the lowest wage earners may not be able to survive off only part of their paycheck.
AB388 is supported by numerous unions and worker advocacy groups, including the Communication Workers, SEIU, AFSCME, Washoe Education Association and Make It Work Nevada.
“Employees and workers are people,” said Erika Washington, executive director of Make it Work Nevada. “They are human beings… We believe that being able to support, advocate, love and support our families is indeed a human right and a reproductive justice issue. Everyone has somebody they would drop everything for, and it’s our responsibility to care for our families and each other.”
Ben Challinor with the Alzheimer’s Association testified that paid family and medical leave could benefit the estimated 84,000 Nevadans who provide unpaid care for someone living with Alzheimer’s or dementia.
Business groups, including the Vegas Chamber, Nevada Resort Association, Retail Association of Nevada, and several chambers of commerce, are opposed to the bill, arguing they oppose mandates that force solutions that need to be addressed business by business.
They also claimed it will drive up costs for business.
“If the government of the State of Nevada believes it is important to pay people in this state to not work for 3 months, then the State of Nevada can pay for that,” said Tray Abney, Nevada state director for the National Federation of Independent Business (NFIB).
He continued: “Bills with incredibly large fiscal notes or impacts to the state budget have a very hard time getting passed out of here. We don’t always seem to have the same concern for the fiscal notes that affect private sector job creators.”
In her closing remarks, La Rue Hatch argued that paid family and medical leave is an economic benefit that pays itself off in increased productivity and less turnover at business.
“Ikea offers 16 weeks” of paid family and medical leave, she said. “CitiBank, 16 weeks. Bank of America, 16 weeks. Google, 18 weeks paid leave after 90 days of employment. Huge corporations making significant profits have figured out how to take care of workers. It is not mutually exclusive.”",https://nevadacurrent.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Image-4-2-25-at-8.09-PM-1024x710.jpeg,,,2025-04-03 10:01:59.011138

Eleven days after 18-year-old Jesse Mickelson was gunned down in a South Minneapolis alley, homicide detectives returned to the home where Mickelson had been playing football moments before his murder. The detectives had good news to share, so Mickelson’s family and friends squeezed around the dining room table to hear it.
“Yes,” someone said. “Thank you.”
Dale and his partner, Sgt. Christopher Gaiters, told the family they had arrested a suspect, a man witnesses said they saw firing from the back seat of a white Dodge Intrepid as it rolled down the alley. His name was Edgar Barrientos-Quintana, and the police had the 25-year-old in custody.
As the family members hugged one another and cried, Mickelson’s father stuck his hand out to Gaiters, then wrapped the detective in a hug.
“Thanks a lot, man,” he said quietly. “Thanks a lot.”
The scene in the grieving family’s dining room was captured in October 2008 by cameras for the A&E true crime reality television series “The First 48.” The premise of the show, as explained by a deep-voiced narrator, is that homicide detectives’ “chance of solving a murder is cut in half if they don’t get a lead within the first 48 hours.” In each episode of the program, which debuted in 2004 and is currently in its 27th season, camera crews follow along with police as they work to beat a clock that counts down in the corner of the screen.
The episode, titled “Drive-By,” tracked the detectives from the moment Mickelson’s family dialed 911 to the arrest of Barrientos-Quintana. Under moody, dark music punctuated by dramatic sound effects, Dale and Gaiters determined that Mickelson, a lanky high school senior with icy blue eyes, was “a pretty good kid” and the unintentional victim of a gang-related drive-by shooting. Based on interviews with witnesses, their faces blurred and voices distorted for TV, the detectives pieced together that “Smokey,” a nickname for Barrientos-Quintana recorded in a police database, was the shooter.
The episode aired in April 2009, about a month before Barrientos-Quintana went to trial.
In court, the case against Barrientos-Quintana that Hennepin County prosecutors presented built on the clean, conclusive narrative of the episode. Witnesses from rival gang cliques testified they either were in the car with Barrientos-Quintana when the crime occurred or saw him shooting at them.
The prosecutors also told jurors that Barrientos-Quintana’s alibi, that he’d been with his girlfriend at a grocery store across town before the murder, still allowed him time to get to the crime scene.
After a jury found Barrientos-Quintana guilty, reruns of the episode ended with a title card that read, “Edgar ‘Smokey’ Barrientos was subsequently convicted of first-degree murder. He was sentenced to life without parole.”
Sixteen years later, that tidy narrative unraveled. Last year, the Minnesota attorney general’s Conviction Review Unit released a 180-page report concluding that Barrientos-Quintana’s conviction “lacks integrity” and ought to be vacated. In November, Barrientos-Quintana — who always maintained his innocence and was never linked to the crime by any physical evidence — walked out of prison.
At a press conference led by Hennepin County Attorney Mary Moriarty, who made the decision to dismiss the charges, Barrientos-Quintana shifted back and forth on his feet and smiled nervously, the grey in his beard a notable difference from his appearance in “The First 48” episode.
“Happy to be out here,” was all that he offered to the reporters asking how he felt. “It’s the best week. And more to come.” Barrientos-Quintana, through his lawyers, declined an interview request.
The Conviction Review Unit report that ultimately convinced both Moriarty’s office and a judge that Barrientos-Quintana should be freed outlined dozens of issues with the investigation and trial, many of them hallmarks of wrongful convictions. Long, coercive interrogations. Improper use of lineup photos.
Both the report and the judge’s order also highlighted one unique issue: the role of “The First 48.”
“In the episode, events happened out of order, and Sgts. Dale and Gaiters staged scenes for the producers that were not a part of the investigation,” wrote Judge John R. McBride. “What is more, the episode failed to include other, actual portions of the investigation, painting a wholly inaccurate picture of how the MPD investigation unfolded.”
Conviction Review Unit attorneys concluded that police and prosecutors became locked into a narrative they did not deviate from. In essence, the unit alleged, instead of the case shaping the show, the show shaped the case.
“They said, ‘We got the right guy. We got him,’ before they knew or really looked into the existence of Edgar’s alibi,” said Anna McGinn, an attorney for the Great North Innocence Project who represented Barrientos-Quintana. “It’s on TV. I mean, that’s problematic.”
Barrientos-Quintana’s exoneration may be the first in the country related to the “The First 48,” but it is not the first time the program has found itself embroiled in controversy, though not necessarily because of its conduct. In 2010, for instance, “The First 48” was filming when a Detroit police SWAT-style team raided an apartment and an officer shot and killed 7-year-old Aiyana Stanley-Jones. In Miami, a man featured on the show as the prime suspect in a 2009 double murder sat in jail for 19 months before the police finally determined he wasn’t responsible. In both cases, subsequent lawsuits accused the police of shoddy investigations and hasty decision-making in the service of creating good TV. Both cases ended in settlements — $8.25 million in Detroit — paid out by the cities, not “The First 48.”
“No one cared that my boy was killed, and the cops just rushed it for a damn show,” the father of one of the double murder victims told the Miami New Times.
Prosecutors, judges, defense attorneys and city officials across the country have bemoaned their police departments’ decision to allow the show into active crime scenes to film officers investigating sensitive homicide cases. It’s even been raised as an issue by an attorney who represents a death row inmate in Tennessee.
“I wish that the city would never contract with ‘The First 48,’” remarked one New Orleans judge in 2015 after the show was accused by defense lawyers of lying about deleting raw footage of a triple murder investigation. “I hope in the future they would think through that.”
“The First 48,” like similar programs such as “Cops” and “Live PD,” is sometimes derided as “copaganda,” pro-law-enforcement entertainment that poses as documentary. But it’s popular enough that A&E frequently programs hours of reruns back to back. Fans discuss favorite episodes on a busy, dedicated Reddit channel.
While other police reality shows have also received negative attention and have been canceled after high-profile incidents, “The First 48” has largely avoided broader public scrutiny. Over the past two decades, the cities of Memphis, Tennessee; New Orleans; Detroit; and Miami have ended their relationships with “The First 48” after the show’s presence snarled prosecutions or otherwise created problems.
Those severed partnerships seem to have done little to slow production of the show. Kirkstall Road Enterprises, the subsidiary of ITV that produces the show, simply moved on; the most recently released episodes were filmed in Tulsa, Oklahoma; Gwinnett County, Georgia; and Mobile, Alabama, although Mobile did not renew its contract in 2023 after complaints from defense attorneys.
Neither ITV nor ITV America responded to numerous requests for comment or to a detailed list of questions. A spokesperson for A&E Network declined to comment.
Moriarty was Minnesota’s chief public defender the last time she tangled with “The First 48” on behalf of clients in 2016, and she is still dealing with fallout from the show in her first term as Hennepin County attorney.

“They are allowed to continue to do probably a great deal of damage without being discovered, without really having any consequences,” said Moriarty. “Hopefully, places where this is happening, the city, city council, mayor, whatever, could put a stop to it, and cities where it isn’t happening, they could be prepared when ‘First 48’ comes to their town.”
‘A false narrative’ 
When Assistant Attorney General Carrie Sperling, the director of the Minnesota Conviction Review Unit, began her reinvestigation of the Barrientos-Quintana conviction, one of the first things she did was watch the episode of “The First 48” that featured his case. She was immediately alarmed.
“It’s a false narrative,” she said. “Investigators are just misrepresenting details about the case on TV.”
Barrientos-Quintana began reaching out for help with his conviction almost as soon as he got to prison. In 2011, he became one of a handful of inmates whose cases were accepted for review by the Great North Innocence Project, a nonprofit that investigates possible wrongful convictions in Minnesota and the Dakotas.
But his appeals went nowhere and, according to McGinn, the case was essentially dormant until the Minnesota attorney general’s office launched its Conviction Review Unit in 2021. Because the unit operates within a state law enforcement agency, its investigators had access to material Barrientos-Quintana’s lawyers said they never saw.
Sperling wanted to understand why detectives zeroed in on Barrientos-Quintana and left other potential suspects to the side. In Gaiters and Dale’s theory of the crime, Barrientos-Quintana was a member of the Sureños 13 gang and had recently gotten into a fight with a member of a rival clique called South Side Raza. The leader of that clique, nicknamed Puppet, lived across the alley from Mickelson’s house and may also have been seeing the same girl as Barrientos-Quintana.
Early on in the investigation, a student at Mickelson’s high school told police she’d heard that the shooter was named “either Smokey or Sharky.” Dale and Gaiters identified a 16-year-old boy known as Sharky, but for reasons the Conviction Review Unit report said are “not clear,” detectives decided that Sharky was an accomplice, while Barrientos-Quintana, or Smokey, was the shooter.
In the course of listening to hours of Gaiters and Dale’s original interviews with witnesses, Sperling was struck by how differently “The First 48” portrayed those conversations. According to the Conviction Review Unit report, about a half-dozen witnesses, some of them Mickelson’s friends and family and some from Puppet’s side of the alley, all agreed on one thing: The shooter was bald, “shiny bald” even. That fact is never mentioned in the episode, and footage of Barrientos-Quintana’s arrest and interrogation shows him with a full head of black hair.
“They show the video footage of Edgar being arrested at work, and he’s clearly not bald,” said McGinn. “That is an intentional omission, I believe, and that’s very misleading.”
At the time Mickelson was shot and killed, Barrientos-Quintana had an arrest record and had convictions for driving offenses and misdemeanor property damage, according to court records. He’d been affiliated with the Sureños 13 gang, but he told detectives he’d left that life behind and was working at a computer warehouse.
More importantly, perhaps, he told police he was with his girlfriend in a suburb on the other side of town the day of the shooting. In “The First 48,” Dale makes a phone call to a “family friend” of Barrientos-Quintana’s, a conversation that Dale implies has blown the alibi apart, leaving a four-hour window when Barrientos-Quintana could have committed the murder.
In reality, the 15-year-old girl Barrientos-Quintana was with on the day of the shooting was being questioned at the same time in a separate room. She told detectives repeatedly that Barrientos-Quintana had been with her the whole day at her home. When investigators suggested the pair couldn’t have spent the entire day indoors, the girl offered that at one point they’d left to go to the grocery store but had come straight back.
Toward the end of the episode, a distraught Barrientos-Quintana tells Dale, “Right now, I just want to get myself a lawyer.” In the episode, the interrogation stops, as if Barrientos-Quintana’s constitutional right to an attorney was immediately honored. But according to the Conviction Review Unit report, Gaiters and Dale ignored his requests for a lawyer and, at one point, a third officer told Barrientos-Quintana that the detectives would not listen to him if he kept asking for representation.
“The First 48” cameras were long gone when, months later, Gaiters and Dale obtained security camera footage of Barrientos-Quintana and the girl at the grocery store. The footage shows the pair together, smiling and walking toward the store’s exit, just before 6:20 p.m. The shooting took place roughly 33 minutes later and about 14 miles away, creating a narrow window of time for Barrientos-Quintana to part ways with the girl, change clothes and meet up with his supposed accomplices before witnesses first spotted the Dodge Intrepid behind the Mickelson home.

“The First 48” episode about the case aired about two months after this new piece of evidence came to light. There is no mention of it in the program.
The security footage was far from prosecutors’ only challenge heading into the May 2009 trial. In preparation, according to the Conviction Review Unit report, prosecutors Susan Crumb and Hilary Caligiuri learned that Dale had been “playacting for a reality TV crew” and the defense might be able to use that revelation to undermine the testimony of Dale or Gaiters.
In addition, prosecutors told their supervisors in a memo that the show had edited footage of the investigation out of chronological order, generating an inaccurate depiction of what happened. As a result, only Gaiters testified.
Because the episode aired before trial and a key witness watched it, Crumb and Caligiuri scuttled plans to ask him to identify Barrientos-Quintana in court. All of this was revealed in the memo Caligiuri and Crumb wrote to their supervisors immediately following the trial to express their concerns about the city working with “The First 48,” the contents of which were never shared with Barrientos-Quintana’s defense attorneys.
Caligiuri, who is now a judge, is precluded from speaking to the press by the Minnesota Code of Judicial Conduct, according to a court spokesperson. Crumb, in an email response to questions from ProPublica, took issue with many of the characterizations in the Conviction Review Unit report but agreed that “The First 48” had been a problem.
She said the producers’ scripting for Dale was “innocuous” but could have caused problems for prosecutors in cross-examination. And she said a young witness became so afraid after seeing clips of the episode that he ran away from home and, even after police arrested him, refused to testify for prosecutors.
“Contrary to the CRU’s assertion, Barrientos-Quintana was not wrongfully convicted, as the Minnesota Supreme Court confirmed and as an unbiased review of the file and trial record would confirm,” Crumb, who is retired, said in the email.
“The filming of the ‘First 48’ created problems the defense used to try to sow doubt regarding the Defendant’s guilt,” she added. “If there was any ‘hindrance to the administration of justice’ in this case, it was only to the detriment of the prosecution, not the defense.”
At trial, Gaiters testified that when he re-created the route from the grocery store to the crime scene, it took 28 minutes, enough time for Barrientos-Quintana to commit the shooting with just minutes to spare. But that did not account for how the girl he was with got home, nor did it square with the claim by Sharky, who was by now one of the prosecution’s chief witnesses, that after he met up with Barrientos-Quintana in a park near Mickelson’s home, they “cruised around,” adding several minutes to the timeline. A private investigator hired by the defense testified that his re-creation of the route took him 33 minutes.
The man identified as Sharky could not be reached for comment.
Dale, who retired from the Minneapolis Police Department in 2023, declined to comment. Gaiters rose through the ranks of the department to become assistant chief of community trust. Through a department spokesperson, Gaiters declined to comment.
The Police Department did not respond to a detailed list of questions other than to confirm that it ended its relationship with “The First 48” in 2016. But ahead of Barrientos-Quintana’s release, Chief Brian O’Hara said publicly he supported Dale and Gaiters’ original investigation and was “concerned that a convicted killer will be set free based only upon a reinterpretation of old evidence rather than the existence of any new facts.”
The jury struggled to come to a verdict, at one point close to deadlocking with three members unwilling to convict, according to the Conviction Review Unit report. But after being allowed to review Sharky’s testimony, they found Barrientos-Quintana guilty. He was sentenced to life without parole.
In his order vacating the conviction, McBride wrote that the “colossal failures” and “ineptitude” of Barrientos-Quintana’s original lawyers were — on their own — grounds for a new trial. The Conviction Review Unit report also criticized his lawyers, saying they repeatedly failed to challenge many aspects of the prosecution’s case as well as Gaiters’ testimony.
Messages left for Barrientos-Quintana’s four pretrial and trial attorneys were not returned. According to the Conviction Review Unit report, in the years following the trial, one of the lawyers was disbarred, a second had his law license suspended for unethical behavior and a third, who dropped out of the case just before trial, was convicted of swindling a client. The fourth lawyer, the report said, has a clean disciplinary record but had passed the Minnesota bar just a month before trial.
According to McGinn, being featured on “The First 48” gave Barrientos-Quintana an added — and unwelcome — notoriety in prison. She said that although he is now free, he is distraught that, until recently, “The First 48” episode was still available in reruns on A&E and other channels, and was available for streaming.
“There’s been no statement that says, ‘Hey, we retract this,’ or ‘This is an inaccurate depiction of what actually happened that night that Jesse was killed,’” said McGinn.
A&E said last week that the episode is not currently available.
Journalism or entertainment
Kirkstall Road Enterprises, which was once known as Granada Entertainment USA and Granada America, enters into agreements with police departments sometimes without the knowledge or approval of other departments in city government. That’s one reason prosecutors and other officials have felt blindsided by the problems “The First 48” has caused them.
After 7-year-old Stanley-Jones was shot and killed by police in 2010 as “The First 48” cameras rolled, then-Detroit Mayor Dave Bing said he was shocked to find out that his chief of police had agreed to embed a reality television crew with officers.
“That’s the end of that,” he reportedly told the chief before banning the practice.
Minneapolis police signed agreements to allow the program to film from 2007 to 2009 and then signed a new deal with the program in 2014. But the city ended its relationship with the show two years later, after legal fighting over the show’s raw footage delayed court proceedings and then-Hennepin County Attorney Mike Freeman slammed the program.
“‘The First 48’ is an entertainment device. It’s not a device seeking truth or justice,” Freeman said at the time. “It gets in the way of us doing our job, the defense doing their job. We wish the police would never have signed up for this.”
Freeman, since retired, did not respond to requests for comment.
Copies of contracts between police departments and Kirkstall Road Enterprises reviewed by ProPublica give producers broad access to investigations so long as they do not interfere with officers’ work. They also have creative control over the final product, though departments are allowed to review an episode before it airs. Police departments can request changes, but producers are not obligated to make them.
The contracts also show that Kirkstall Road Enterprises does not provide departments with any monetary compensation. Before ending its relationship with the show after nine years, the chief of the Miami police requested that the production company donate $10,000 for every Miami episode to the department’s charitable youth athletic league in order to continue filming. The show did not accept those terms.
There are benefits to law enforcement, like positive publicity and recruitment potential. Alabama police officials in Birmingham and Mobile said they believed the show helped them solve more murders.
After New Orleans ended its contract with the show, the head of the police union, the Police Association of New Orleans, told a reporter, “At a time when community relations are so fragile, locally and nationally, it was of enormous benefit to everyone to have an avenue open for the public to see what we do and how we do it.”
Although the New Orleans police ended their relationship with “The First 48” in 2016, they’re now participating in a new A&E program called “Homicide Squad New Orleans,” which began airing episodes this year.
Officers featured on “The First 48” also sometimes enjoy a degree of local celebrity. One Dallas detective became so well known that a suspect recognized him as soon as he walked into an interrogation room. A detective in Memphis, according to court filings, carried photos of herself to sign for fans of the program. Fan accounts on Instagram wish their favorite detectives happy birthday and track their promotions.
The biggest issue with the show for defense attorneys and prosecutors is access to the raw footage, especially in the days before body-worn cameras — footage that may not make the ultimate “The First 48” episode but could capture important conversations and some of the earliest images of the crime scene.
“It’s incredibly important for prosecutors and defense lawyers to have video of anything that pertains to the scene or witnesses,” said Moriarty.
But according to court documents, Kirkstall Road Enterprises instructs all of its field producers — employees “who act as producer, cameraman and sound technician all rolled into one,” according to an affidavit provided by the show’s senior executive producer — never to share raw footage with law enforcement. It is also the show’s practice to decline all subpoenas for footage using First Amendment arguments, citing state shield laws that protect journalists from turning over their reporting material. Prosecutors and defense lawyers have struggled to convince judges that the needs of the state or the defendants override those protections. The show also claims it is routine practice to destroy all raw footage after a completed episode is delivered to A&E.
But reporters and others say it’s important to protect their work from being seized by police and prosecutors, as well as to maintain their credibility and independence. In short, they don’t want to become, or even be seen as, arms of government. But Moriarty said she believes that, by embedding with police during an active investigation, “The First 48” occupies a gray area.
In 2016, when Freeman, the former Hennepin county attorney, was trying to get footage from “The First 48” in ongoing cases, he said that he found the show’s refusal to provide it problematic.
“If ‘The First 48’ tries to pull the mantle of the First Amendment around this and be sanctimonious — you know something, defendants have rights,” he said at the time. “And people want the truth.”
Later that year, the contract between “The First 48” and the city of Minneapolis expired and was not renewed. A spokesperson for the Minneapolis Police Department confirmed the end of the relationship and added that “MPD has transitioned away from formal contractual agreements with media partners and now engages with them on a case-by-case basis.”
A pivotal scene
Looking back on the “The First 48” episode now, the Conviction Review Unit’s Sperling said one part bothers her most: the oddly performative scene with Mickelson’s family jammed around the dining room table with Gaiters and Dale.
Tina Rosebear, Mickelson’s 44-year-old half-sister, was present the night of the detectives’ visit, though she barely registered that a camera crew was filming; she was still in shock over the murder.
Rosebear, a personal care assistant and gas station clerk, took on a lot of responsibility in her family at an early age. She was more than an older sister to Mickelson, becoming his primary caregiver when he was 8 years old.
“I know that’s your son,” she remembers telling their mother when Mickelson died, “but that’s my baby.”
Before “The First 48” became more widely available, Rosebear kept multiple copies of the episode on DVD, labeled in Sharpie with the date of his death. She’s watched the episode dozens of times. Although she acknowledges some might find it strange, she said she gets a sense of comfort seeing the blurred shots of her brother’s body — the footage captured one of the last times she saw him in his “human form,” as she puts it, before he was zipped in a body bag and later reduced to the box of ashes she keeps on her bookshelf.
But Rosebear said it only took until Page 40 of the Conviction Review Unit report for her to realize that she and her family had been misled by the police — and also by “The First 48.”
“I feel like it was all done for the TV show,” she said. “But that was unfair to him, and that was unfair to us.”
Rosebear attended the press conference announcing Barrientos-Quintana’s release. She’d seen him in court at his trial, but that was their first real meeting. She apologized to him on behalf of her family and gave him a hug.
“He gets to be with his family now, and now we can try to continue to heal with the loss of my brother now that everything was just ripped back open,” she told reporters.
The Conviction Review Unit report not only cleared Barrientos-Quintana, but it contained information that could theoretically point to the real gunman. But Rosebear isn’t sure she could handle going through the whole process again — another arrest, another trial.
Once a fan of “The First 48,” Rosebear said she now hopes that the program is shut down.
“Could they have did a better job if the TV show wasn’t involved? Probably,” she said. “Nobody knows now. Because it’s too late.”

Kennedy, [&#8230;]","Robert F. Kennedy Jr. gives remarks at the Renaissance Phoenix Downtown Hotel on Aug. 23, 2024 in Phoenix, Arizona. Photo by Rebecca Noble/Getty Images. I am one of the 68 million Americans living with mental illness and one of the over 10 million Americans who have been diagnosed with bipolar disorder. 
On February 13, President Trump issued an executive order establishing the President’s Make America Healthy Again Commission, chaired by Secretary of Health and Human Services Robert F. Kennedy, Jr.
Among other initiatives, the commission is charged with assessing “the prevalence of and threat posed by the prescription of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, antipsychotics, mood stabilizers, stimulants, and weight-loss drugs.”
Where does this initiative find its genesis, and what would be the consequences if Kennedy’s past and current public statements become reality? 
We are finding out right now.
In July 2024, during a presidential campaign town hall, Kennedy referred to Americans who take psychiatric medications for ADHD, depression and anxiety as “addicts.” He shared his plan to send Americans living with addiction — including presumably people with mental health diagnoses — to “wellness farms” in rural areas. He has described these “farms” as places where people would be cured of disease by eating organic produce and not taking previously prescribed medication.
During his Senate confirmation hearing in January, Kennedy suggested antidepressant medications may be as addictive as heroin — a claim contradicted by research. 
To test his credibility on the psychiatric medicines millions of Americans need, let’s examine his views on more well known medical issues, like vaccines. 
In February, Kennedy said “nothing is going to be off limits” with regard to children’s vaccine schedules, according to a leaked video viewed by The Hill.
Now we have seen the first consequences of Kennedy’s actions. On February 26, the FDA — under Kennedy’s direction—  cancelled a meeting of seasonal flu vaccine experts that had been scheduled to start planning the national response to the next flu season.
On March 10, amidst a deadly measles outbreak in Texas, Kennedy suggested that the measles vaccine had harmed children, among many other false and misleading claims not supported by research. Now we are learning that NIH is planning to terminate or limit grants for studies on why certain communities do not get vaccinated, as happened in the Mennonite community in Texas.
Peter Marks, the top vaccine official at the FDA, was forced to resign, saying that Kennedy was mostly interested in “subservient confirmation of his misinformation and lies.” 
Either by cruel malice or incompetence, Kennedy is steering the ship of national public health into a Charybdis that could have more devastating consequences than the Trump administration’s response to the 2020 pandemic.
The medications that I am prescribed for bipolar disorder and diabetes have greatly improved my life, and really made my life possible.
I take 120 mg of lurasidone daily, which is an antipsychotic medication that will be targeted by Kennedy’s commission. Clinical psychosis is where excited brain activity causes false thoughts, like delusions about being invisible or able to fly. I had my first episode in 2013 when I was 20 years old, a common age for a first episode. I had my second episode in 2017 after I asked my doctor for permission that I go off of lurasidone to lose weight. That was a mistake in hindsight, and I live with a lot of trauma because I wasn’t on that medication to prevent another episode of psychosis.
I take lithium and lamotrigine, which are mood stabilizers that work in different ways. I take 1,800 mg of lithium carbonate (the mineral) daily and 100 mg of lamotrigine daily. These medications are also targeted by Kennedy’s commission. They help regulate the ups and down of mania and depression that are common for Americans with bipolar disorder who are not on medication.
I also take two diabetes drugs. In May of 2023, my A1C, which is the measurement for diabetes, was in the diabetic range, so I started a GLP-1 medication to help correct that. I am now in the healthy, normal A1C range and take tirzepatide and metformin for diabetes and weight loss. These medications are also being targeted by Kennedy’s commission.
Like any good son of Abraham, I know that we humans are not perfect. Our brains and bodies were not evolved to be always well adjusted; they were evolved to keep us alive in a dangerous world. If you are paranoid about getting eaten alive, maybe there’s a greater chance that you and your family will survive and prosper.
But we live in the year 2025. We don’t have to live with clinical depression, anxiety, PTSD and all the rest. We can take medications backed by decades of clinical research that make huge improvements in our quality of life, every single day. 
Until recently, we also didn’t have to live with polio, measles or other diseases easily prevented with vaccines developed decades ago.
If Kennedy is able to fully complete his vision for American health care, 341 million Americans would be left without the seasonal flu vaccine and possibly other vaccines about which he has raised doubts.
Already, the Trump administration has stopped funding appropriated by Congress for COVID-19 test kits and other public health campaigns, leading to a mass layoff of workers at the Minnesota Department of Health. 
Kennedy and Trump are also cutting funding for basic medical research, slashing the budget of the National Institutes of Health, which is responsible for many of our medical breakthroughs and drug development, including in psychiatry.
The logical conclusion of Kennedy’s past statements and current actions is that he would like to rescind FDA approvals for psychotropic medications like those taken by me and tens of millions of Americans every day.
So what’s the worst that could happen? Consider a common malady like the flu: According to data from Centers for Disease Control, from 1999 through 2015, the highest mortality rates in other countries around the globe from seasonal flu are about four times that of the U.S. 
In the 2024-2025 flu season, the estimated flu deaths in the U.S. with current availability of vaccines and treatments is 21,000 to 100,000 for the season. So there is a real potential for somewhere on the order of 300,000 more deaths per year if Kennedy succeeds in his anti-scientific campaign. And that’s only the seasonal flu.
Americans have already been going to Canada for more affordable prescription drugs for the past several decades, especially before the Affordable Care Act and former President Biden’s move to curb the cost of medication.
If current trends continue, we may well see millions of Americans crossing the border to get their seasonal flu and COVID shots, their antidepressant medication, and other health care needs that were once legal and normal in America. We may see contraband lithium carbonate labeled as candy shipped in from Mexico. We can make a joke about how incredibly stupid it all is, but it’s no joke that Kennedy has the potential to kill hundreds of thousands and upend or ruin millions of lives that have been made well by prescribed medication backed by decades of clinical research.
The threat is real. It’s posted right on the White House website. It’s happening right now with the seasonal flu vaccine, measles and clinical research. 
It’s important to speak up, call out what’s stupid and harmful, share the stories of millions of Americans, and stop Kennedy’s fever dreams from coming to pass.",https://minnesotareformer.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/rfkjr-5-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-04-03 09:06:18.968861

The House of Delegates gave final approval Wednesday evening to a bill that would create a Maryland Reparations Commission, sending the measure to the governor for his signature.
The 101-36 party-line vote would make Maryland one of the few states in the nation with a statewide body to study the inequality endured by African descendants. California became the first state in 2020 to pass legislation; then Illinois in 2021 and New York in 2023.
If approved, the commission would assess specific federal, state and local policies from 1877 to 1965, the post-Reconstruction and Jim Crow eras. Those years “have led to economic disparities based on race, including housing segregation and discrimination, redlining, restrictive covenants, and tax policies,” according to the bill.
The commission would also examine how public and private institutions may have benefited from those policies, and would recommend appropriate reparations, which could include statements of apology, monetary compensation, social service assistance, business incentives and child care costs.
Passage Wednesday followed 90 minutes of sometimes emotional debate and attempts to amend the bill, which could have blocked its passage with just five days left in the General Assembly session.

Del. Lauren Arikan (R-Harford) tried to amend the bill to have the commission study the impact of government policyies on those who endured child sexual abuse and those as minors “in the care and custody of the State.” Arikan, who identified heraself as a victim of abuse, emphasized her point by reading out about three dozen names of child abuse victims.
“I will stand up again on any bill I can continue to read the names of victims that our state’s harmed today,” said Arikan, who told a reporter she had been “molested as a young child.”
“That is what reparations is, paying back the aggrieved and the injured,” she said. “So don’t wait 200 years to help the families of these victims who we have harmed today.”
Del. Joseline Peña-Melnyk (D-Prince George’s and Anne Arundel), said that she used to work as a child-neglect lawyer in Washington, D.C., and that she  understands Arikan’s passion for children.
But Peña-Melnyk, the chair of the Health and Government Operations Committee, told her colleagues to reject Arikan’s amendment because it rewrites the measure and “changes the purpose of the bill. They’re very different issues.”
The House appeared to agree, rejecting the amendment 101-34.
Delegates also rejected two amendments from House Minority Leader Jason Buckel (R-Allegany), one that would have limited reparations to Maryland residents and another that would have required the commission to estimate the fiscal impact to the state of any of its recommendations.
“We will have people come from all over [the] 50 states and try to find ways to receive those payments, justifiable or not, however you feel about it,” Buckel said of his proposed residency restriction\. “That is what will happen.”
Peña-Melnyk said the commission will assess and determine eligibility requirements. In addition, she said the commission must submit a preliminary report of recommendations by Jan. 1, 2027, to explain its findings, and a final report by Nov. 1 of that year.

The House rejected the residency amendment 101-38.
As for the fiscal reporting requirement, Peña-Melnyk noted that the bill already requires the commission’s final report include an estimate of costs “associated with awarding any type of reparations recommended.”
“So you see my friend, it’s already in the bill and it’s not needed,” Peña-Melnyk said. That amendment failed 100-37.
‘Reparation tax’
The all-volunteer commission would consist of nearly two dozen people, including two employees from the state’s four historically Black colleges and universities with expertise in the history of slavery; a representative from the Maryland Lynching Truth and Reconciliation Commission; and the state archivist or a designee from that office.
Although the House passed Senate Bill 587, sponsored by Sen. C. Anthony Muse (D-Prince George’s), many delegates hugged, smiled and even shed a few tears with Del. Aletheia McCaskill (D-Baltimore County). McCaskill sponsored the House version that didn’t advance out the Health and Government Operations Committee.
That’s fine with her.
“It’s about ushering the purpose and the plan. I work very well behind the scenes, and so it’s OK,” she said to two reporters after Wednesday evening’s debate. “I would love to give Sen. Muse the glory for accepting to be my cross-filer [bill]. Because in prior years, we did not have a cross-filer. So finally, we made it through.”
It also helped that, for the first time, the Legislative Black Caucus made the bill one of its top priorities for the 90-day session that ends Monday. A hearing on the Senate version was first held Feb. 27 and then approved by the full chamber March 14.
Critics, like Del. Matthew Morgan (R-St. Mary’s), called the measure divisive and said it would amount to a “reparation tax.”
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
“I think it’s disgraceful that we’re going to set up a reparation tax that might tax one race and give to another race,” he said. “It is the year 2025. Are you kidding me? All in the name of equity? Equity is a Marxist term. Splits people up and divides it.”
But Del. Stephanie Smith (D-Baltimore City), noted that Black Marylanders in the 1900s paid taxes but did not receive the benefits from them.
“There were roads they paid for, they could not drive them. There were schools they paid for, they could not enter,” she said. “We are offering just a conversation and a commission to acknowledge that they were here, that they lived, that they contributed, and I think they merit our time because they lived, they died … and guess what? They were taxpayers that never got what they invested in.”
The bill would go into effect July 1 and remain in effect until June 30, 2028.

Dozens of trucks filled with fresh food bound for Nevada’s food banks were pulled back last week then the USDA cancelled 40% of food deliveries ordered by the Nevada Department of Agriculture under the Emergency Food Assistance Program, funded by the federal Commodity Credit Corporation.
Three Square Food Bank ― which serves Clark, Lincoln, Esmeralda, and Nye counties ― was notified March 25 that about one million pounds of USDA food donations slated for the food bank had been canceled. Beth Martino, the CEO of Three Square Food Bank, said part of that delivery was funded through the Commodity Credit Corporation.
That same day, the Food Bank of Northern Nevada ― which serves about 160,000 Nevadans monthly across 12 counties ― was informed that 350,000 pounds of food they were expecting between April and August would be immediately canceled. 
According to the Nevada Department of Agriculture 35 trucks of fresh food scheduled for delivery to Nevada’s food banks were abruptly canceled by the USDA. The Food Bank of Northern Nevada was slated to receive 12 of those trucks. 
“This was additional food that we got through that program that, frankly, we need right now. The need is extraordinarily high at the food bank,” said Jocelyn Lantrip, the director of marketing and communications at the Food Bank of Northern Nevada. “We’re helping 160,000 people every single month, which is about 76% higher than it was before the pandemic.”
In October, the USDA announced $500 million in additional funding to support food banks through the Emergency Food Assistance Program. That funding has now been canceled as part of an ongoing campaign to slash the federal budget, leaving Nevada with less food to fill its emergency food pantries.
A spokesperson for the USDA said that while the Emergency Food Assistance Program “continues to operate uninterrupted with more than $166 million spent in recent months” the additional half-a-billion in funding for the program has been terminated.
Asked to explain the rationale for ending the funding, the USDA, in a statement, said the additional $500 million in Commodity Credit Corporation dollars were announced by the Biden administration “without any plans for long-term solutions.”
The USDA said that despite terminating the additional funding for food banks the agency “has not and will not lose focus on its core mission of strengthening food security, supporting agricultural markets, and ensuring access to nutritious foods.”
The USDA recently cut federal funding for two other food assistance programs in Nevada, including about $8 million in funding for the Home Feeds Nevada program which allowed food banks to buy directly from local producers.
Before the funding was frozen last week, the food bank received about two million pounds of food through Commodity Credit Corporation funding over the last 12 months. If the funding is not reinstated the food bank anticipates it will lose roughly the same amount of food donations next fiscal year.
“The situation has gotten worse for many families so as far as the food bank is concerned, we don’t think it’s a great time to cut funding for food programs, because we’re seeing more need than we’ve ever seen,” Lantrip said.
A cascade of challenges
The Commodity Credit Corporation funding offered more meat and dairy to food banks than other federal commodity programs. The high-protein staples that come directly from USDA funding aren’t easily replaced by donations or other sources, Lantrip said. 
“That’s what makes it so significant, because this type of food is harder to source. It’s more expensive,” Lantrip said. “Meat and protein items are always difficult for food banks to find, just because there’s less of that in the donation stream, and it’s more expensive to source if we’re purchasing.”
A diverse funding stream will allow the Food Bank of Northern Nevada to continue operating at its current capacity, but addressing wider USDA cuts to the food bank will be more difficult to overcome, said Lantrip.
“Replacing that food in the long term is the larger concern for us,” Lantrip said.
Other food pantry operators in Nevada said the cuts put yet another strain on nonprofits that are already trying to address high levels of need, leaving operators scrambling to quickly fill in gaps with their own funds, food purchases and donations.

The Community Food Pantry, which serves the Reno-Sparks area, said they would lose a third of their food deliveries due to the cuts. The food pantry has seen a 21% increase in the total number of clients visiting from the same time last year, an increase the extra dollars largely helped cover.
“The biggest drawback is that it brought in healthy foods. Potatoes, fresh veggies, and proteins ― whether it be milk or eggs or cheese,” said Barbara Monroy, the director of the Community Food Pantry.
“I’ve started to look around at other places where I could get food, because if the food bank doesn’t happen, I’ve got to find it somewhere else,” Monoy continued. “Right now we’re looking at applying for additional grants that aren’t government related, reaching out to donors, and trying to find other programs that might be able to fit the need.”
For the Community Food Pantry, the cut in USDA food donations adds to other financial issues brought on by inflation and higher operating costs for the nonprofit.
“Our car insurance went up 40% this year. It’s crazy that this is happening,” Monoy said.
Three Square Food Bank said the canceled shipments represent a small portion of the donations the food bank is expecting. Last year, Three Square distributed more than 41 million meals, the equivalent of more than 49 million pounds of food and grocery products.
But at a time when the cost of food and other basic needs continues to increase, and the threat that the increases could accelerate as a result of Donald Trump’s tariff policies, the loss of nutritional funding will be felt by low-income Nevadans. 
News of the canceled deliveries also comes as Congress seems poised to further cut other safety-net programs like the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP), which gives low-income Americans money to buy food. The prospect of such additional cuts  only intensifies the need for nutrition assistance programs, Monoy said.
“The need hasn’t gone away since COVID, by any means,” Monoy said. “Just this last weekend we talked to several people in line and their SNAP benefits are $23 a month. I know another woman who gets $17 a month. That just doesn’t seem to be enough to help people when a dozen eggs is $11.”
Prices for all food are predicted to increase 3.2% this year, according to data from the USDA, and grocery store purchases are now 1.9% higher than this time in 2024. The overall annual inflation rate for 2024 was 2.9%.
Nevada’s workforce has also been slower to recover from the financial impact of the pandemic. Nevada currently has the highest unemployment rate in the nation at 5.8%, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. 
“Everybody’s feeling the pinch,” Monoy said. “It’s just the high cost of everything that’s forcing people into the pantry line.”",https://nevadacurrent.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/PXL_20250305_172257574.PORTRAIT-large-1024x771.jpg,,,2025-04-03 09:06:18.968861

(Photo by Spenser Heaps for Utah News Dispatch)A bipartisan coalition of Utah lawmakers are calling on Congress to resume and expand a program that pays people sickened by nuclear weapons testing, which expired nearly one year ago and has hung in limbo ever since. 
On Tuesday, 41 lawmakers, mostly from the Utah House of Representatives, signed a letter to Congressional leadership urging them to revive the now defunct Radiation Exposure Compensation Act, or RECA, which compensates people who lived downwind from nuclear weapons testing in the 1950s and early 1960s. 
Known as downwinders, an untold number of people in the West were diagnosed with cancer from Cold War-era nuclear weapons testing and development. In 1990, decades later, Utah GOP Sen. Orrin Hatch successfully sponsored RECA. 
SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
But in June, the program expired after Congress failed to renew it, meaning any claim postmarked after June 10 was not considered. And in the year since, downwinders have been lobbying for some kind of action, with support from Utah Gov. Spencer Cox, a number of members of Congress and dozens of advocacy groups. 
“We support efforts to expand compensation for those affected by the nuclear testing that occurred throughout the West,” Cox said in a statement to Utah News Dispatch last year. “It’s the right thing to do.”
In their letter — addressed to House Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La, Senate Majority Leader John Thune, R-S.D., Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y. and House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries, D-N.Y. — Utah lawmakers echoed the governor. 
“Our state legislature has a long history of nearly unanimous, bipartisan support for related legislation, as shown in previous resolutions passed by this body. Our state’s tragic history of past uranium mining and downwind exposure from nuclear tests has compelled us to fight for Utahns who have been harmed, as well as to support those in other parts of the country who have similarly suffered,” the letter reads. “We agree with the governor: reauthorizing and expanding RECA is simply the right thing to do.” 
Sen. Hawley blasts rumors of expanding payments for Utah downwinders only

Since it expired in June, several versions of a RECA expansion have been proposed — that includes a bill from Missouri GOP Sen. Josh Hawley that would increase the compensation for downwinders, expand eligibility for certain uranium workers, and widen the current definition of an “affected area” to include all of Utah, Arizona, Colorado, Idaho, Montana, Nevada, New Mexico and Guam. It would also cover parts of Hawley’s district near St. Louis, where creek water was contaminated by radiation during nuclear weapons development.
The original version of RECA only covered a handful of counties in Utah, Arizona and Nevada, despite ample evidence that all of Utah and other states in the West were downwind from nuclear weapons testing. Cold-war era uranium workers in 11 Western states were also included. 
Hawley’s bill passed the Senate in March 2024, but it stalled in the House, with some Republicans concerned it was too broad and expensive. 
In the letter, Utah lawmakers called Hawley’s bill “significant progress.” 
“Unfortunately, Speaker Johnson refused to bring up this bill for a vote,” the letter reads. 
Hawley has worked on a compromise, but there hasn’t yet been a vote. Last week, The Hill reported that Hawley would not vote to raise the debt limit if there wasn’t some kind of RECA reauthorization and expansion attached. 
In the letter, Utah lawmakers say the state’s congressional delegation is on board with some kind of compromise. 
“We are gratified that through negotiations and discussions with our congressional coalition throughout the year and in response to constituent concerns, the Utah delegation is now in support of these efforts and put forward a compromise in late December. Negotiations on the expansion details continue,” the letter reads. “Efforts to pass RECA legislation are ongoing in 2025, and we urge the Senate and House leadership to act without delay. We request that legislation reauthorizing and improving RECA be included in the next viable legislative vehicle.”
The letter was signed by the Utah Senate’s six Democrats, and Republican Sens. David Hinkins of Orangeville, Ron Winterton of Roosevelt, and Derrin Owens of Fountain Green. 
In the House, all 14 Democrats and 18 Republicans signed the letter. Those 18 Republican representatives are:

She was opposing HB 244, sponsored by Rep. Mack Butler, R-Rainbow City, at a public hearing on April 2. (Anna Barrett/Alabama Reflector)Legislation that would expand the state’s “Don’t Say Gay” law and extend legal protections to those who misgender other people drew a large number of opponents to an Alabama House committee meeting Wednesday.
HB 244, sponsored by Rep. Mack Butler, R-Rainbow City, would prohibit public school teachers at all grade levels from teaching or discussing gender identity or sexuality. The legislation also prohibits the display of pride flags and insignia in the classroom.
The law currently bans such discussions from kindergarten to fifth grade, but Butler said the expansion aligns with President Donald Trump’s agenda and executive order.
“This simply is in line with President Trump’s executive order, and I would encourage you guys to pass it as is,” he said.
The committee also held a public hearing for HB 246, sponsored by Rep. Scott Stadthagen, R-Hartselle, that would give public educators legal immunity and students immunity from discipline for using a person’s legal name and pronouns aligned with their reproductive organs, instead of the name and gender with which they identify.
Opponents, many of whom identified as transgender or nonbinary, significantly outnumbered supporters 10-2. 
Susan Stewart of Huntsville, a critic of the legislation who is cisgender and heterosexual, said the Don’t Say Gay expansion was unconstitutional.
“You’re going to tell that teacher that they have to use words that they know will harm their student? You’re actually going to tell a teacher that if students ask questions about a classmate with two mommies, they have to drag students aside for private conversations, creating an atmosphere of shame and confusion in their own classroom?” Stewart said Wednesday.
Becky Gerritson, executive director of Eagle Forum, a conservative organization, said schools should be “neutral” in their curriculum.
“Schools should be places of learning, not activism, and this provision ensures that classrooms remain neutral and focused on education,” Gerritson said.
Former Rep. Patricia Todd, D-Birmingham, the co-chair of Alabama Equality, an LGBTQ+ advocacy group and the first openly gay person elected to the Alabama Legislature and testified that seeing a Pride flag or hearing about other gay people did not make her gay.
“It was a feeling of the heart,” Todd said. “We’re here. We’re not going away. We’re going to continue to be loud and proud.”
Butler claimed a small minority of teachers were pushing gender ideology on their students. He would not name schools where that is happening.
“I’ve talked to a student in my county talking about one teacher that cannot teach the curriculum without spending all their time focused on gender ideology,” he said.
The legislation bans discussion of gender ideology in “instructional time.” Rep. Jeanna Ross, R-Guntersville, said that does not apply to private conversations between a student and a teacher, fellow student or nurse.
“A student could still have a conversation with the teacher,” she said.
Stadthagen’s bill would require students to get a permission slip signed by their guardian for teachers to call them by a different name. Opponents said it would create an unnecessary burden for teachers. 
Allison Montgomery, a member of Alabama Trans Rights Action Coalition (ALTRAC), said the bill could require students with non-English names that go by a nickname for ease of pronunciation to get a permission slip. 
“This bill would prevent teachers from calling them by their nickname, because it is not a derivative thereof, even with the permission slip,” Montgomery said. “This would place an undue burden on teachers to keep track of who has the permissions lit and who doesn’t.”
Paige Gant, a former math professor at the University of Alabama in Huntsville, said the legislation was a solution in search of a problem.
“In my eight years of teaching I have not come across a single situation in which a lawsuit would’ve been appropriate against a university regarding what pronouns someone did or did not use,” she said. 
Gerritson said she did not want to be forced to go against her own moral and religious beliefs to adhere to somebody else’s life.
“No one should be forced to speak or act in a way that violates their conscience, especially within our schools and universities,” Gerritson said. 
Montgomery said the bill would not protect parents’ rights, but instead protect people with bad intentions.
“There’s a narrative about things like these that they’re trying to protect kids. But how does it protect kids to require teachers to know what genitals their students have?” she said. “Only a certain type of person would want this, and we don’t want to empower those types of people.”
The committee did not vote on either bill on Wednesday. Rep. Terri Collins, R-Decatur, the chair of the committee, said they would return soon.

(Photo by James Brooks/Alaska Beacon)Alaska’s two U.S. senators split Wednesday on a vote against President Donald Trump’s economic tariffs against Canada.
The U.S. Senate voted 51-48 to approve a resolution that would end the presidentially declared emergency that allowed Trump to impose tariffs on Canada.
The vote was largely symbolic because the resolution has almost no chance of passing the U.S. House, where the Speaker of the House has already taken action to prevent the emergency from ending.
Sen. Lisa Murkowski, R-Alaska, joined Senate Democrats and three other Republicans in voting to end the presidential emergency. The other Republicans were Susan Collins of Maine, Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, and Rand Paul of Kentucky. Paul co-sponsored the resolution.
Sen. Dan Sullivan, R-Alaska, joined all other Republicans in voting to oppose the resolution and support Trump’s decision.
Murkowski’s vote had been expected; in the days preceding the vote, Trump issued a statement asking her and other Republicans to “get on the Republican bandwagon, for a change.”
After her vote, Murkowski explained her reasoning in a statement on social media.
“While not all Canadian trade practices are fair, I’m keenly aware of the negative impacts in store for Alaskan families and businesses should tariffs drive up the costs of essential goods,” she wrote.
“In Alaska, this relationship matters. We share more than 1,538 miles of border with Canada – some of our communities share schools and churches. Our best-known road is the Alcan (Alaska-Canada) Highway. We are friends, neighbors, partners, and allies when it comes to our economies, our mutual defense, our cultures, and, yes, our trade.”
In enacting the tariffs, Trump cited the flow of illegal drugs from Canada to the United States. Statistics published by the Canadian and U.S. governments show 0.2% of the illegal fentanyl sold in the United States comes from Canada. More fentanyl flows from the United States to Canada than vice versa.
“Like any relationship, there are certainly areas for improvement. I support the President’s efforts to block the flow of fentanyl in our country, but we should remember the old saying that the U.S. and Canada are ‘neighbors by geography, and friends by choice.’ In that same spirit, I’m certain we can find a better way to mutually secure our borders and address fentanyl trafficking than by starting a trade war,” Murkowski wrote.
Sullivan’s office, in a statement released after his vote, said, “Last year, U.S. Customs and Border Protection seized enough fentanyl crossing the northern border to kill more than 9 million Americans.”
“Senator Sullivan believes that we should not accept any amount of deadly fentanyl coming in from either our Southern or Northern border,” said the emailed statement. “For the last two years in a row, Alaska has experienced the largest increase in drug overdose death rates of any state in the country. Senator Sullivan believes we need to do everything we can to stop the poisoning of Alaskans and Americans, including using tariffs as leverage to get Canada, Mexico and China to put more resources into stopping this deadly drug from coming into our country. The senator doesn’t believe the President’s goal is to have these particular tariffs in place forever, but rather they should drive our nations toward greater cooperation on this critical challenge. The senator will be evaluating the results of this strategy and its impact on Alaskans in the weeks and months ahead.”
In response to Trump’s policies, British Columbia’s government has introduced legislation to permit the province to levy a toll on vehicles traveling from the Lower 48 to Alaska.

Dina Neal wants to put some guardrails around artificial intelligence companies setting up in Nevada and prevent some professions such as police officers and teachers from misusing the technology.  
Senate Bill 199, heard Wednesday by the Senate Commerce and Labor Committee, would establish a process for AI companies to register with the Bureau of Consumer Protection within the Attorney General’s Office. The legislation would require AI companies to develop, implement and maintain policies, procedures and protocols to prevent hate speech, bullying, bias, fraud and the dissemination of misinformation.
Much of the language in the bill was based on principles outlined by the Organization for Economic Cooperation Development, a global policy network, and included language similar to “a definition that is used in 44 countries, including the United States,” Neal said.  
She also used language found in Colorado legislation that passed in 2024 and established AI regulations. 
Business groups, including the Vegas Chamber and the Las Vegas Global Economic Alliance, opposed the legislation arguing it would stifle “economic growth” by deterring tech companies from moving to the state. 
“The unfettered movement of AI without guardrails is not the intent and not the direction I seek to move,” Neal said. “We should know how data is being used within an AI system. We should be able to consent to when and how our information is used in an AI system …There should be some accountability.”
SB 199, if passed, would also prohibit law enforcement from using AI to generate police reports or teachers from using software to create lesson plans. 
The Associated Press reported last year that Oklahoma City was using AI chatbots to generate crime reports from recordings picked up by body cameras and police radios. Neal was shocked by the story and realized “we really need to deal with this” to ensure there were “guardrails that are associated with police reporting.”
“I wanted to make sure that it was something we were proactively considering,” Neal said, expressing alarm at the possibility that “a person is actually going to be affected negatively by the police reporting that may not have been done by (police), but by an AI chatbot.”
Law enforcement groups, including Las Vegas Metropolitan Police Department and Washoe County Sheriff’s Office, opposed the section.
Jason Walker, a lobbyist for the Washoe County Sheriff’s office,  said there are “many advantageous uses of AI in the law enforcement profession.”
He didn’t specify what specifically about the prohibition on using AI to generate police reports he was against. 
In addition to preventing teachers from creating AI-generated lesson plans, the bill creates a working group on the use of artificial intelligence systems in the education system to develop further recommendations and guidelines. 
Two Clark High School students who worked on sections of the bill regarding education presented the legislation alongside Neal on Wednesday. 
They cited a recent incident in which five students in a business class turned in nearly identical AI generated assignments – with the same spelling mistakes. 
Celine Chang warned lawmakers that “unregulated AI use is affecting students, teachers and the learning environment” but the state lacks standardized regulations.
Clark student Karen Wu, said AI isn’t just a tool to “supplement learning but to replace it.” 
“We acknowledge that AI is not going away, but the way we integrate it into education will determine whether it becomes a tool for enrichment or a shortcut that erodes learning,” she said.
The bill would also prevent landlords and property management groups from using AI from determining rent prices. 
Republican state Sen. John Steinbeck questioned if that provision would hurt the housing market. 
“It’s my understanding that apartment operations utilize AI software to assist with filling apartments,” he said. “It helps them with the market analysis and may actually help lower some housing costs.”
The provision, Neal said, was to prevent price fixing by real estate software companies such as Real Page, which has faced numerous lawsuits for artificially raising the price of rents. RealPage has denied wrongdoing in these cases. 
Neal specifically highlighted the North Carolina case where the state attorney general “sued six companies for colluding to raise rent instead of competing in the fair market using AI tools.”
“They exploited landlord sensitive information to create a price fixing algorithm, or pricing algorithm that violated antitrust laws,” she said.
The legislation would also require the Nevada Department of Employment, Training and Rehabilitation to estimate the number and types of Nevada jobs at risk of being lost due to AI. 
“We have seen reports that within five years, there’s going to be a serious shedding of traditional jobs” as a result of AI, Neal said. “At the end of the day, the state is responsible if their citizens are out of work.”
Other than the bill’s presenters — Neal and the students — no one testified in support of the legislation.

HB 477, sponsored by Rep. David Faulkner, R-Mountain Brook, was the subject of intense debate lasting nearly an hour. Supporters said farmers needed more health care options, while opponents warned about the proposed legislation’s lack of consumer protections. 
“We have the opportunity here in Alabama to help the farmers and small business owners who are the heart of communities… by allowing the federation to develop an Alfa health plan for its members,” Faulkner said to the committee, claiming the plan could “save a family in your in your district up to $18,000 a year.”

The bill would create the means for a nonprofit agricultural organization — fitting the description of the Alabama Farmers Federation (Alfa) — to provide health plan options not subject to state insurance regulations. 
The bill states the qualifying organization is “not a health insurer and is not engaging in the business of health insurance.”
Proponents said the measure could be a lifeline for farmers and small business owners struggling with conventional health insurance costs.
Monica Carroll, whose husband is a sixth-generation farmer from Dale County, said health care costs forced her to take an off-farm job despite wanting to manage the family poultry operation.
Her newly-married son, she said, wanted to join the farm. But she asked, “How are they going to be able to afford health care?… Who will be the ones to carry on our legacy if they can’t afford a health care plan and still be able to farm?”
While the bill mandates coverage for ambulatory patient services, hospitalization, emergency services, and laboratory services, opponents pointed out the absence of requirements for other ACA essential health benefits. They raised concerns about potential loopholes and the lack of patient protections established under the Affordable Care Act (ACA), such as excluding individuals with pre-existing conditions.
“We believe this bill threatens those protections by allowing the sale of health plans that are not required to cover essential health benefits… and can discriminate against individuals with pre-existing conditions, including cancer,” said Jane Adams, government relations director for the American Cancer Society Cancer Action Network (ACS CAN) in Alabama.
Adams cited alleged negative experiences from Tennessee’s similar plan, which provides health plans that are not traditional health insurance to Tennessee Farm Bureau members, including denials based on conditions like a history of melanoma or a negative breast biopsy. She also warned the bill could “destabilize the insurance market” by siphoning off healthy individuals from traditional health insurance.
Ben Sanders, executive director of government affairs for Tennessee Farm Bureau Insurance, said Tennessee’s Farm Bureau health plan, which has been operating since 1947, accepts 85-90% of applicants, has a 98% retention rate, covers conditions like cancer after enrollment, includes mental health and prescriptions, and does not impose annual or lifetime limits. He also claimed that data showed their plan did not negatively affect Tennessee’s ACA marketplace. While acknowledging Tennessee’s plan had 250 complaints in 2024, he said this was out of 2.6 million claims processed.
Faulkner said the bill is not meant to reform health care insurance but to help a small portion of the population with health care costs and that Alabama’s bill was “more restrictive” than Tennessee’s or any other state.
Deanna Deschaun, a resident of Shelby County who lives with multiple sclerosis and works with the National Multiple Sclerosis Society, said that she feared plans could deny enrollment based on individuals’ pre-existing conditions or impose annual and lifetime limits on benefits.
She also pointed out that if someone develops a condition like MS and loses coverage under the Alfa plan, it “does not trigger a special enrollment period” for ACA marketplace coverage, which is typical for people who lose health insurance, potentially leaving them uninsured when they most need health care.
“Offering Alabama farmers health plans that may not provide coverage for pre-existing conditions does not protect them from high health care costs. In fact, enrolling in these unregulated plans — and lack of transparency around them — makes it more likely that farmers will experience financial harm,” Deschaun said.
Faulkner said the bill resulted from extensive negotiations and included numerous safeguards, pointing to provisions like requiring a complaint system for customers and rules for out-of-network emergency care payments. The plans would also be subject to a 1.3% premium tax payable to the state’s General Fund. He called it “by far the most comprehensive Farm Bureau plan in the country.”
“This is not a plan for everyone. This doesn’t even save the nation or the state in health care, but it is an option. It is an option for some, and it could mean economic survival for small business owners and farmers,” Faulkner said.
But the plan is not for everyone. After the committee meeting, Faulkner said that for people with pre-existing conditions have other options, like getting health insurance through the marketplace.
“The ACA Health Marketplace is there. It’s there right now. What we’re trying to do is provide an option for farmers [and] small business owners so they can lower their health care costs,” Faulkner said.
But Rep. Frances Holk-Jones, citing 48 years as an insurance professional, questioned the lack of explicit language requiring agents to be licensed by the state. She also said that the bill does not explicitly say which benefits are covered, saying that “planning” to include those in the contracts gives her “great concern.”
“I want the word ‘planning on it’ out of the discussion. I want the words, ‘this is what we’re doing,’” she said.  
Ted Hosp, vice president of governmental relations for Blue Cross Blue Shield of Alabama, the largest private insurer in the state, said he expected the bill to pass, but asked for specific amendments. 
Hosp said that “at the very least” there should be a provision that states once a person has such a health plan, the plan can’t be canceled, and premiums can’t be raised if the person gets sick. He also asked the committee to consider mandated coverage of mental health and prescription drugs, and explicit enforcement authority for the Department of Insurance.
“Alfa has told you that they plan to do all of the things that we are asking to be put in this bill at this point. Based on that and based on the commonsense nature of the changes that we are asking for, it’s surprising to me that Alfa has not simply accepted those changes and moved on,” Hosp said.
House Health Committee Chair Rep. Paul Lee, R-Dothan, also seemed concerned about codifying consumer protections. He asked Sanders and Faulkner if they were intended to cover benefits like mental health and why it was not explicitly listed in the bill along with other covered benefits.
Faulkner pushed back, saying that most states don’t have covered benefits listed on the legislation, and that is determined through contracts.
“Of the 10 programs out there that have passed in states, only two listed benefits in their bill … This is the four benefits that were listed in two out of the 10 plans. So, we have done that and listed those here,” Faulkner said.
Lee asked if Faulkner meant that Alfa would cover the additional benefits not listed in the legislation, which Faulkner confirmed Alfa would.
“All I’m asking is for it to be put in writing,” Lee said.

(Photo: Kyle Roerink)Arguing over how to use the land in Nevada has defined the political conversation for a long time, starting with statehood, running through the Cliven Bundy saga, and up to the present moment with the debate over what role public lands should play in addressing the housing crisis. The availability of thriving natural places is a blessing that we need to manage carefully to make sure Nevada stays a great place to live and work as we also work to expand affordable housing for working families.
It’s important to add some context to the current push to liquidate these places for development.
The “Sagebrush Rebellion” kicked off in Nevada nearly half a century ago by special interests that wanted to gain control over public property for their own commercial gain. It continued on through Mr. Bundy’s challenge to public ownership of land he refused to pay to use. And unfortunately, it’s rearing its ugly head again in the conversation, this time under the pretext of mass disposal of public lands to create affordable housing.
Modern day sagebrush rebels have seized on the affordability crisis to create a narrow private gain from public resources. One proposal in Congress from Utah Sen. Mike Lee, a longtime opponent of public ownership of public lands, would create the broad liquidation of public lands under the deceptive guise of creating more housing. That legislation doesn’t mention the word “affordable” once, meaning that it could be sold to anyone from politically-connected billionaires to wealthy real estate developers who want to create high end housing for the super-rich.
There are frankly no details available to confirm that the latest Trump administration is much better. As they have done with so many other initiatives, the administration issued a press release before the policy, so there’s no telling if the ultimate use of this land will be for Tesla server farms or places Nevadans can afford to rent or buy.
Public lands are supposed to benefit the public. Period. That’s why any sales for the purposes of housing should truly create affordable options for working people.
Fortunately, there are already tools in place that accomplish this goal. Regulations currently in place at the Bureau of Land Management require such lands to be sold only when it benefits the “national interest” – exactly what’s at stake in the campaign for affordable housing. A bill recently passed with bipartisan support to make some administrative U.S. Forest Service lands available for lease for the purposes of affordable housing.
These measures are a better path for Nevada and other states with fast-growing communities across the West, and they’ve already been used to create more affordable housing right in our backyard.
Public lands conservation is an important tool for managing growth. They provide essential services like clean water filtration and and air purification—services that benefit everyone, not just those who live near them. Surging ahead without protecting these important resources will not benefit anyone in the long-run.
As the conversation continues around how to tackle the housing crisis, we urge decision-makers to consider policies that are not just focused on short-term solutions but that also preserve our public lands for the long term. With Lake Mead sitting at only one third of capacity we can’t throw the baby out with the bathwater (if you’ll pardon the expression) through a wholesale liquidation of public lands that includes no guarantees to protect the public interest.
If public lands are truly to benefit the public, then we must make sure any that are sold or leased are guaranteed to be used for affordable housing. And we must ensure that some other lands are protected for their water resources and the quality of life they create for our families.
The majority of people in Nevada and around the West want a balanced approach to public lands management, not a return to the tired old fights of the past. Our leaders have a chance to chart a new path. Let’s hope they hear us.",https://nevadacurrent.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/hidden-valley-roerink-1024x768.jpeg,,,2025-04-03 08:02:32.223938

Judiciary approved the bill about six weeks after the House Public Safety and Homeland Security did so in February. It is unusual for a bill to go through two committees before going to the floor of the House for a vote. The last major legislation to get routed through two House committees was the bill legalizing medical cannabis in Alabama in 2021.
The current bill, largely unchanged from last year, allows local law enforcement, such as sheriff’s offices and police departments, to enter into agreements with federal agencies to arrest and detain people who are not legally authorized to reside in the country.
Once in custody, deputies and police officers must then attempt to determine a person’s immigration status and get the help of an interpreter to determine someone’s nationality.
If a person cannot provide documentation proving they are eligible to live in the country, local law enforcement may then reach out to a Law Enforcement Support Center (LESC) to get information about a person’s immigration status.
The bill states that people cannot be detained solely because of their immigration status unless authorized by Immigration and Customs Enforcement, and that sheriffs’ deputies and police departments will verify that a person has an arrest warrant within 24 hours of the person getting detained.
Law enforcement must also obtain documents to verify a person’s immigration status, bet that a passport or a permanent resident card.
House Judiciary Committee members approved an amendment making a few of the requirements optional. A previous version required the Alabama Attorney General’s Office to publicly name any agency failing to comply with provisions in the legislation and notify the governor’s office.
The updated language gives the AG’s Office an option to inform the Governor’s Office.
Another amendment also allows, but doesn’t require, local law enforcement to report the total number of people arrested and the number of foreign nationals they take into custody as well as the inquiries they make to the LESC.
Immigration advocates who spoke at a public hearing on the legislation in March said the legislation is creating fear among immigrant communities. That, they said, would lead to mistrust toward law enforcement and increased school truancy for children of immigrants who are afraid to attend school for fear of their parents being deported.
Democrats on the House Judiciary Committee criticized the legislation.
“What country do we border in Alabama?” asked Rep. Penni McClammy, D-Montgomery during the committee meeting Wednesday.
Yarbrough said that every state is connected, and that people travel.
“Each state doesn’t have a physical wall, so people travel from state to state,” Yarbrough said.

(Photo courtesy of National Institutes of Health)In February, health experts at Rutgers University published an alarming report: A currently available blood test for Alzheimer’s disease was not accurate in Black patients.
The test measures the level of p-Tau217, which is a protein that indicates someone might have Alzheimer’s. By comparing MRI brain images to these results, researchers were able to show that the tests were mostly accurate in white patients, predicting someone having Alzheimer’s 87% of the time. However, that number was only 58% in Black patients, showing that these tests aren’t yet ready for prime time.
“In another five to 10 years, these tests may get to the point where we can reliably use them, but right now, they are similar to some of the home COVID tests that had accuracy issues,” William Hu said in a statement. Hu is director of the Rutgers Center for Healthy Aging Research and heads a cognitive neurology and Alzheimer’s disease clinic at Robert Wood Johnson Medical School.
I don’t think it’s a stretch to say that this is important work. If doctors want to switch from testing spinal fluid, which can be expensive and painful, to an easier and cheaper blood test, they need to know those blood tests actually work for everyone by establishing ranges so that they can know if a result indicates Alzheimer’s in people of different racial backgrounds. Otherwise, patients will be underdiagnosed and miss out on treatments and medications that can address cognitive and behavioral symptoms early on in the progression of the disease.
But this is the kind of research in the crosshairs of the current federal administration, which is using a slash-and-burn approach toward what it considers “woke” policies in the federal government. Apparently, creating medical tests that work for people from different racial and ethnic backgrounds is an assault on freedom, or it’s government waste, or it’s woke, or it’s whatever buzzword du jour right-wing pundits are using on that particular day.
Not only is this attack a destabilizing move for New Jerseyans who rely on research and medical centers for jobs and medical care, but it’s depriving the world of critical resources, even if we’ll never know what they could have been.
Studies like this are targets on two fronts. First, while some of the funding for it came from Fujirebio US, a private research and development company, it was also made possible by four different grants from the National Institute on Aging.
The NIA is part of the National Institutes of Health, a $47 billion, world-leading scientific organization that the Trump administration seems hell-bent on destroying. The organization gives out about 60,000 grants per year. Or did. Grants are being terminated seemingly at random, according to The Atlantic, and while a lot of the cancellations seem random (maybe done with AI), most have been focused on those that focus on diversity, equity, and inclusion. The agency also plans to lay off between 3,400 and 5,000 people, according to STAT News, and is trying to cap “indirect costs,” which pay for things like lab equipment and hazard waste disposal, out of grants
And over at the National Science Foundation, grants are being investigated for using words like “female,” and “race.” As such, work on creating treatments for severe bleeding and concussions has been flagged because their grants use works like “trauma,” according to ProPublica.
The federal government is also using threats of cutting funding to bully universities to bend to their will. It has said it will cut $400 million in funding from Columbia University for alleged “antisemitic harassment,” $250 million of which comes from the NIH, according to Science.
The administration has said it’s also investigating 59 other universities, including Rutgers. This would be devastating for New Jersey, where health care and medical research is a key economic driver. Locally, the NIH invested more than $405 million in 53 New Jersey-based projects in 2024, with about $250 million going to Rutgers.
While I don’t know if Hu’s work is being affected (Rutgers did not respond to my request for comment), the paper has a DEI section. And given that this administration temporarily removed a story about Jackie Robinson’s military service from the Department of Defense website (adding “dei” to its website url), I don’t expect them to look fondly or even closely to funding that would better perfect Alzheimer’s blood tests if they’re going to — gasp — work in people who aren’t white.
Lawsuits are still flying over all of these actions. New Jersey Attorney General Matt Platkin is one of 22 attorneys general suing the federal government over NIH cuts, and while lawsuits about executive orders that have affected the NIH have been successful, chaos still reigns (NIH leaders and employees received terminiation notices this week). Whether or not they’ll hold will play out in the courts, but it’s already wreaking havoc on what has been a nationwide, shining example of how the government can fund biomedical research for the good of us all. When grants are cut at someone’s racist, sexist, and transphobic whims, we all suffer for it.

Brad Barrett introduces a bill in the Senate health committee on March 26, 2025. (Whitney Downard/Indiana Capital Chronicle)A bill that would tighten Medicaid eligibility and add work requirements for certain programs was amended and passed out of the Ways and Means Committee in just under an hour on Wednesday, moving on a party-line vote.
Earlier that day, a separate committee advanced two other bills impacting the state’s low-income health coverage program, with one seeking to establish a “diversion” program to the state’s fastest-growing expense.
Senate Bill 2, authored by Sen. Ryan Mishler, would quadruple the administrative workload of the Family and Social Services Administration by requiring quarterly eligibility checks, a concern for some committee members. 
  Rep. Peggy Mayfield, R-Martinsville, asks a question on Feb. 6, 2025. (Whitney Downard/Indiana Capital Chronicle)
“Those dollars that we’re putting toward administrative costs could be applied to services,” said Rep. Peggy Mayfield, R-Martinsville. 
House sponsor Rep. Brad Barrett, R-Richmond, assured his colleagues that FSSA was “comfortable” with the workload increase, swaying Mayfield.
“I feel comfortable that you feel comfortable that the agency has its authority already … to make adjustments on its own with the legislation,” Mayfield said, speaking to a later, related amendment. 
That wasn’t enough for all committee members, particularly Democrats. Rep. Tonya Pfaff, of Terre Haute, pointed to her rural constituents. Rural Hoosiers make up a significant chunk of Hoosiers on Medicaid who may not have the tools to comply with quarterly reviews.
“A lot of my community is rural and doesn’t have access to broadband,” said Pfaff. 
Sixteen Republicans voted in favor, overcoming the opposing votes from seven committee Democrats. 
 The amended bill

As it arrived in the House, the proposal already allowed for eleven exceptions to the work requirement, including pregnant Hoosiers and those seeking treatment for substance abuse. The language applies to just the Healthy Indiana Plan, which primarily covers working-age Hoosiers with low-to-moderate incomes. 
Disabled and elderly Hoosiers would not be impacted.
But a large amendment added one more exception for full-time students while also clarifying that someone who worked and volunteered for a combined 20 hours a week would also meet the minimum requirements. 
Hoosiers rally to protect Medicaid from state, federal action 

Barrett also focused tweaks to a prohibition on advertising the program, allowing the agency discretion to reimplement advertising in the future, as well as presumptive eligibility. 
Presumptive eligibility, Barrett said, meant “intake at hospitals have the ability to run a quick screen and determine whether or not that patient seeking services has eligibility.” 
“We found that there’s a high risk … a high rate of error in that,” Barrett continued. 
He said lawmakers worked with stakeholders to use retroactive eligibility instead, meaning that patients found to be eligible will then have their services for the last 30 days paid for once they’re accepted. 
The newly amended bill will also now has an expanded definition of caregiver, after the committee accepted a suggestion from Rep. Ed Clere, R-New Albany. Now caregivers will also include spouses in addition to parents. The amended language also explicitly protects Medicaid coverage for Hoosiers receiving caregiving under other state programs. 
But Republicans rejected three edits put forth by Democrats, not including two that were voluntarily withdrawn. The amendments, all authored by Rep. Greg Porter, would have removed work requirements entirely, eliminated the advertising prohibition and reduced eligibility determinations to twice annually.
Rep. Cherrish Pryor, also an Indianapolis Democrat, urged caution when it came to rescinding health coverage for Medicaid enrollees. 
“It’s better safe than sorry,” Pryor said. “Because we are talking about the health of Hoosiers.” 
Republicans pointed to dual benefits of the bill: reducing state expenses and preserving the program for “deserving” Hoosiers.
“I think it’s going to make a significant difference on the cost side, as well as helping people out, so I’m actually hopeful,” said Rep. Jack Jordan, R-Bremen. 
The previous version of the bill included a cap on 500,000 Hoosiers, below the 700,000-plus receiving coverage now, as well as a three-year limit. Both provisions have been stripped from the bill though it gives FSSA the latitude to limit enrollment on its own. 
 Other health bills

Clere, who proposed the caregiver amendment on Senate Bill 2, had two other bills up in committee earlier on Wednesday: one that sought to add a caregiving tier to a program for children with complex medical needs and another concerning a “Medicaid diversion” program.
Last year, FSSA opted to limit a state attendant care program after an unanticipated surge in demand from parent caregivers to medically complex children. The lack of guardrails on the program meant that some families made triple-figure incomes and reportedly worked 90-plus hours weekly.
Nearly all families have now moved from the attendant care program to Structured Family Caregiving, meaning they no longer receive payments based on an hourly wage. The latter program utilizes three tiers of daily stipends aligned with the level of care needed. 
“House Bill 1689 requires FSSA to work with the (Division of Disability and Rehabilitative Services) Advisory Council to refine and develop plans for serving individuals requiring extraordinary care,” said Clere.

Jennifer Dewitt is the mother of Jackson, a 17-year-old with complex medical needs. She notes that other states have also created programs for complex care assistants, under which parents can certify and be paid through a nursing agency for their caregiving. 
 “This isn’t replacing a nurse, it’s going to be limited to family members … in many cases, this provides care when no nurses are available,” said Dewitt, part of the Indiana Families United 4 Care group representing parents. “We have data that shows that when parents are paid caregivers, hospitalization rates go down, saving the state significant amounts of money, and the reimbursement rate would be substantially less expensive than (registered nurse) services.”
Like many other families, Dewitt said she couldn’t secure a nurse to meet all of her Medicaid-approved hours. 
Jackson is on a ventilator and also has seizures, meaning she can easily work in excess of 120 hours a week on his care, she said. 
The bill also adds an ombudsman position to FSSA for individuals receiving disability services and requires FSSA to report annually on Medicaid home- and community-based waiver services.

House Bill 1391, on the other hand, would allow for a study to potentially realign coverage areas for senior care agencies, known as Area Agencies on Aging and allow certain service providers under the CHOICE program to not be Medicaid approved. 
“I think we all agree that someone who’s doing pest control services, for example, probably doesn’t need to be a Medicaid provider,” said Clere.
But the bill also positions the CHOICE program, which stands for Community and Home Options to Institutional Care for the Elderly and Disabled, as a “Medicaid diversion program.” 
“CHOICE predated the (Medicaid) waiver. But ever since there’s been a waiver, I would argue CHOICE has been effectively a Medicaid diversion program,” Clere said. “This bill formalizes that.”
The proposal creates a pilot program for CHOICE recipients served by senior care organizations to explicitly keep Hoosiers from needing Medicaid funding. That can include stopping falls and preventing medication mix-ups, the two biggest reasons Hoosiers enter long-term care. 
Both of Clere’s amended bills moved out of a Senate health committee unanimously, though the latter will also need approval from the Senate Appropriations Committee.

One of those is a documentary called  “Water’s Journey” by acclaimed underwater explorer Wes Skiles. 
In it, a couple of divers plunge into a sinkhole and travel hundreds of feet below the ground to explore the Floridan Aquifer. As they traverse our watery underworld, a pair of colleagues track their progress above ground. 
Everyone who’s seen this movie remembers one scene in particular in which the divers squeeze through a deep passage while, up above, their colleagues wander around in a Sonny’s Barbecue. “They’re heading towards the salad bar!” one of the trackers announces to the baffled diners.
I heard a sort of a sequel to that scene last week while I was visiting Alachua County. Trust me when I tell you it’s a classic Florida story, complete with mass resignations, allegations of undue political influence, and a developer who’s apparently obsessed with “Gone with the Wind.”
The Sonny’s part of “Waters’ Journey” occurred when the divers were swimming through an area known as Mill Creek Sink in Alachua County. Mill Creek Sink is a crucial part of the drinking water supply for that Central Florida county. 
“The Sink funnels water from the 70 square miles that surround it into vast caverns of the Floridan Aquifer, making it a jaw-dropping diving site and a highway for contaminants,” WUFT-FM reported last year.
Yet right now one of Alachua County’s more turbulent small towns is considering letting a developer build a project named Tara Forest West: a 523-home neighborhood, virtually on top of it. It’s sure to bring with it lots of polluting lawn fertilizer, gasoline, pesticides, and herbicides like Roundup, which will then seep into the caverns and wind up contaminating the aquifer.
By the way, building things on top of underground caverns increases the likelihood of sinkholes suddenly opening up and swallowing everything.
Leading the fight to prevent this project from happening is an unusual group of clean water advocates: cave divers just like the ones who starred in “Water’s Journey.”
In fact, one of the daring divers is now running for a city commission seat. You might say when it comes to small-town politics, he decided to take the plunge.
The hidden river
The town of Alachua, pronounced by some residents as Alachu-WAY, shares its name with the county of Alachua, pronounced Alachu-wah, where it’s the second-largest city after better known Gainesville.
The town stretches along U.S. 441, the highway Tom Petty mentions in “American Girl.” It’s also somehow become the home of the largest Hare Krishna community in North America.
  Downtown Alachua via Visit Gainesville
Both the county and city’s names come from a mangled Spanish-Native American reference to a sinkhole in Gainesville’s Paynes Prairie area.
Sinkholes, springs, and swallets give us a glimpse into the natural resource that provides most of our drinking water, the Floridan Aquifer. The water flows through the Swiss-cheese limestone formation known as karst, occasionally bursting forth on the surface.
Only a few people have seen the hidden river flowing below ground. These hardy souls are known as cave divers. 
Although cave diving dates to the brass-helmet days of the late 1800s, it didn’t really become popular until after Jacques Cousteau — the French naval hero who had a popular TV show — co-invented the SCUBA system for breathing underwater. 
After that, says a history of the sport, “Cave diving first got its start around 1953 … when the Florida Speleological Society founded the first cave diving organization.”
The sitting president of the Florida Speleological Society is Jacob Fletcher, a cave diver who lives in Alachua and works as a data analyst at the University of Florida. 
  Jacob Fletcher via subject
One day he stepped out of his front door to go for a jog and spotted a sign across the street. The sign was a public notice about the Tara Forest West development. Because Fletcher had been inside Mill Creek Sink, he immediately grasped what a danger the development and its contaminants would pose for the water beneath his feet.
“It’s been kind of a roller coaster since then,” the first-time city commission candidate told me. 
He admitted that his entry into politics required undergoing a makeover. His friends said he looked too much like Shaggy from “Scooby-Doo, Where Are You?” He doesn’t anymore.
Because he’s a data guy, after he saw the sign Fletcher dug into the data on the project. He soon figured out something else was being hidden. Tara Forest West was only one of the projects named for Scarlett O’Hara’s mansion that’s being planned for Alachua by the same developer.
“There’s five of them,” he said. “Five separate plats. It should have been done as one master plan, all at once.”
By splitting them up, he told me, “It hides the scope. Instead of seeing that it’s thousands of houses, you think it’s just 300 or 500. It hides how big of an issue it is.”
Hiding things about this project is what led to the controversy.
The developer swooped in
A couple who are avid cave divers, Bryan Buescher and Vicki Bashore, first told me about all this Tara-rorism running rampant in the town of Alachua. 
Their first trip to dive in the region nicknamed “Cave Country” happened in 2003. They finally moved to North Florida in 2018 so they could go diving more frequently. Yes, they have seen the inside of Mill Creek Sink — hence their concern.
Originally, they said, a developer tried to build a Walmart above Mill Creek Sink. Alachua the city approved a change in the zoning to make it happen, but Alachua the county sued to stop it. 
As a result, the Walmart was never built. People who were worried about the fate of the sink knew that someone needed to make sure that site was never developed.
“The Alachua Conservation Trust was about to buy it,” Buescher told me. “Then this developer swooped in.”
The swooper is Sayed Moukhtara of Gainesville. He’s the man behind not only Tara Forest West but also Tara Forest East, Tara April, Tara Baywood, and Tara Phoenicia. 
I think it’s fair to say he’s obsessed with the single literary work by author Margaret Mitchell. It’s also fair to say he’s not a popular guy. His Tara Forest West was the subject of a citizen petition drive to halt the project. They collected more than 2,000 signatures, which city officials ignored.
Driving the petition signatures is the fact that in 2005, hydrologists dropped some dye into Mill Creek Sink to see how far its waters would flow. The dye showed up 12 days later in Hornsby Spring, six miles away. It was still showing up there after 154 days.
“It’s all hydrologically connected,” a University of South Florida geology professor named Patricia Spellman told me. “The cave system acts like a river and sucks things into it.”
But in a July commission meeting, Moukhtara assured the commissioners that his multi-Taras wouldn’t ruin the caves or the water they contain. He told everyone the four stormwater basins he will build on the site will collect and filter runoff before it enters the aquifer. 
“We are really not trying to do anything that is harmful,” the developer insisted.
But he’s not interested in slowing things down to make sure of that, either. And that’s what led to the mass resignation.
‘I quit’ times three
  Adam Boukari via his website

Complicating the quintuple Tara situation is the involvement of Alachua’s former city manager, Adam Boukari. He’s playing a dual role here, and no I don’t mean like millionaire Bruce Wayne was also Batman.
When Boukari left the city’s employ three years ago, he became a paid consultant, often for developers like Moukhtara. But he was also hired by the town commission to provide guidance to his successor as the city manager, the less experienced Mike DaRoza. 
That’s what led to three of the four members of the city planning department abruptly turning in their resignations in February. One of them wanted to explain what happened, so he sent an open letter to the city commission.
  Justin Tabor via Linkedin
“It appears former City Manager Adam Boukari never relinquished control of the city manager’s position and has essentially been co-managing the city with Mr. DaRoza while representing developers’ interests in a private capacity,” planner Justin Tabor wrote to the commission last month.
Tabor went into detail about how DaRoza pushed the planners to deliver the results most favorable to the developers and quicker than common sense would dictate. He told them not to talk to the city attorney at all, Tabor said. And he pushed them to cater to developers despite them raising lots of questions about the various Taras. 
One of the Taras’ plans calls for bringing in 9,000 dump trucks full of fill dirt to elevate the buildings. That led to concerns about how so much dirt would affect the geology underneath. Maybe it would crumble and be Gone with the Weight.
Everything regarding the Taras, the planner wrote, “was orchestrated by former city manager Adam Boukari to fulfill the needs or desires of Mr. Boukari’s private clients.”
Keep your foot on the gas
A 2003 Gainesville Sun story describes Alachu-way politics as being “rough and tumble,” with city meetings so rowdy that they sometimes resembled “a crowd at a World Wrestling Entertainment event.” One of the town commission’s most vocal attendees said he was thrown out of city meetings 24 times.
Twenty years later, the uproar has hardly died down. I watched a video of a March Alachua town commission meeting that was pretty wild.  
The commissioners voted against hiring an outside firm to help the remaining planner get his work done. The city attorney had a meltdown about being left out the loop by the city manager. A commissioner called her “despicable” for talking about it in an open meeting. The city manager defended himself against Tabor’s accusations, calling them “completely false and unfounded.”
During a public comment section of the meeting, a visibly angry former commissioner named Tamara Robbins told the sitting commissioners, “You are hellbent on keeping your foot on the gas for the destruction of this city.” 
You know who’s not hellbent on destroying everything? Alachua County, which may be the cave divers’ best hope for saving Mill Creek Sink. The county commission has voted to intervene in the discussions as a legal party. They also unanimously approved a 12-part plan to discourage further development around Mill Creek Sink.
I hope they’re able to protect the sink. But I get the sinking feeling that the city commissioners in Alachua may not like the county folks interfering with their final decision on Tara Forest West. Electing just one cave diver to the board may not be enough.
That’s why I think all the cave divers concerned about Mill Creek Sink should show up in force at the next city commission meeting. They should bring with them a bunch of clear canteens. Each canteen would contain water that’s full of Roundup and Tru-Green products. 
As each cave diver steps up to the lectern, they should offer the canteen of contaminated water to the commissioners and say, “This is what you’re voting for.” 
I would hope the commissioners would pay attention to these folks. After all, they’re the ones who have made a deep dive into this issue.

She was released in July 2024 (Emily Curiel/Kansas City Star).The first thing Sandra “Sandy” Hemme did after walking out of prison in July 2024 — after spending 43 years behind bars — was visit her father. He was in the hospital battling kidney failure. 
Ten days later, he was gone.
Hemme, now 65, had been held for a crime she said she didn’t commit — the 1980 murder of a woman in St. Joseph, about an hour north of Kansas City. In June 2024, a judge agreed. By then, she had lost decades with her parents, siblings and a young child.

This article was published in partnership with The Marshall Project, a nonprofit news organization covering the U.S. criminal justice system, and The Kansas City Star. Sign up for The Marshall Project’s newsletters, and follow them on Instagram, TikTok, Reddit and Facebook.

Compounding the loss were the formidable obstacles Hemme faced while seeking to clear her name in Missouri, a state where legal and political systems often resist admitting error even in the face of overwhelming evidence. 
Missouri is unique in that it only allows direct innocence claims for those serving a death sentence. Even after the judge’s order freeing Hemme, officials from the Missouri Attorney General’s office — known for aggressively opposing exonerations — fought to keep her imprisoned.
Advocates say the state’s top leadership has been hesitant to meaningfully reform the systems that kept her behind bars.
Still, Hemme took solace in being present for her father’s final days.
“It was a relief,” Hemme told The Marshall Project-St. Louis in her only interview so far since being released. “A burden was lifted.”
She wishes she’d had more days with him. 
—
Patricia Jeschke, a library secretary, was discovered bound and asphyxiated on her bedroom floor in St. Joseph on Nov. 13, 1980. 
On Nov. 28, then-St. Joseph Police Department detective Steven Fueston visited Hemme at a state hospital where she was on antipsychotic medication, court documents show. Her name surfaced while he was investigating an unrelated disturbance. Hemme told Fueston she thought she caught a ride from Jeschke after leaving the hospital on Nov. 12 from a previous stay. Eventually, Fueston testified, he stopped questioning Hemme that day because “she didn’t seem totally coherent.”
He returned a half a dozen more times. Each time, her story changed. Fueston said he stopped pursuing Hemme as a lead because he felt he would not get the truth from her.
During an eighth interrogation with a different officer, Hemme confessed. 
Meanwhile, evidence surfaced implicating another person who attempted to use a credit card belonging to Jeschke and was found with a pair of earrings that belonged to her. But that investigation came to a halt. Many close to the case believed it was because it was Michael Holman — a St. Joseph Police Department officer.
The police chief at the time even removed an investigator from the case after he concluded Holman, not Hemme, committed the killing.
A judge sentenced Hemme to life without parole after she pleaded guilty to killing Jeschke in April 1981. A new trial was ordered after Hemme withdrew her initial guilty plea, but she was convicted in a 1985 trial. This time, she was sentenced to life in prison without the possibility of parole for at least 50 years. 
—
Hemme began contacting the Innocence Project around 2006. Officials said the organization took her case in 2018. 
In 2023, her lawyers filed a 147-page petition in Livingston County Circuit Court detailing how they built their case. They were able to retrieve documents from the Jeschke murder case and on Holman from the St. Joseph Police Department that had not been previously disclosed. No physical evidence ever connected Hemme to the crime. Psychiatrist Judith Edersheim concluded in an evaluation that Hemme was at high risk for falsely confessing due to her serious mental illness and the antipsychotic medication she had been put on, which likely disrupted her cognitive thinking.  
Sean O’Brien, a Kansas City-based attorney who represented Hemme alongside Innocence Project attorneys, called her case “a failure of everything,” including the St. Joseph police steering the investigation away from one of their own.
Because of the state’s stance that only those on death row can bring innocence claims before a court, Hemme’s attorneys alleged constitutional violations — including that police hid evidence of Holman as a better suspect and that her previous attorneys were ineffective. 
It worked.
 A court exhibit photo showed the home where Patricia Jeschke, the victim, lived and was found (Livingston County Circuit Court).
“It’s not a claim that they can raise if they received any other sentence, life without parole or anything else,” Bay Scoggin, a state policy advocate with the Innocence Project, said of the state’s mandate that those seeking to be freed must be on death row to receive another trial.
The loophole dates back to 2003 when O’Brien was representing Joe Amrine, who was on death row. He was exonerated after the Missouri Supreme Court found clear and convincing evidence of his innocence. Subsequent cases were mostly denied if they lacked a death sentence, until a 2021 law allowed prosecutors to file motions when they believed someone was wrongfully convicted.
Changing the death penalty requirement could happen through action by the state Legislature or the Missouri Supreme Court, said former Chief Justice Michael Wolff, who spent 13 years on the court before retiring in 2011. The question was not brought before the court during his time, Wolff said.
Bipartisan bills proposed this year in Missouri’s General Assembly would allow someone in prison to bring an innocence claim before a judge, who would have the authority to vacate a conviction if convincing evidence supports a person’s innocence.
During a joint hearing on the measures, officials from Missouri Attorney General Andrew Bailey’s office voiced opposition. 
“This bill undermines the rule of law and is a miscarriage of justice,” Assistant Attorney General Jay Atkins said during heated testimony in February before the Judiciary Committee. “And what’s worse is, it’s doing it on the backs of victims.”
State Rep. David Tyson Smith, a Columbia Democrat, asked if reviewing some cases that turned out to be frivolous was worth it if the bill freed an innocent person. 
“You represent the attorney general, and you’re talking about people who could potentially be innocent, and you’re coming in here in almost a hostile manner talking about miscarriage of justice,” Smith said. “Frankly, I find that’s disgusting, especially if there’s people who are actually innocent.” 
Hemme faced similar resistance by the Attorney General’s Office throughout her case. But in June 2024, Circuit Judge Ryan Horsman declared in a 118-page order that she was “the victim of a manifest injustice.” He added that the evidence directly tied Holman, who died in 2015, to the murder.
Horsman ordered her release on July 9. She walked free 10 days later, delayed by interference from the Attorney General’s Office, including officials unsuccessfully filing paperwork to deny the decision and calling the warden to block her release.
—
The attorney general’s resistance to Hemme’s innocence case did not come as a surprise to many on the opposing side. The office has a track record of disputing wrongful conviction claims, even when evidence casts serious doubt on a verdict. That stance has endured under previous leaders from both political parties. 
A spokesman for the office said Bailey and assistant attorneys general who worked on Hemme’s case were not available for an interview.
Megan Crane, co-director of the MacArthur Justice Center, a nonprofit civil rights firm, said it seems like the Missouri Attorney General’s Office “prioritizes finality over fairness.” 
Nicole Gorovsky, a St. Louis attorney who worked in the office’s appellate division from 2001 to 2003 under Democratic Gov. Jay Nixon, said she took the special rules for prosecutors seriously. 
“The underlying principles are prosecutors are to seek justice, not a win,” she said. 
But she agrees that more recent attorneys general in Missouri have fought innocence claims across the board. 
Quinn O’Brien, an investigator who worked on Hemme’s case with the Innocence Project, said she believes the perspective in the Attorney General’s Office “really is that it is OK to keep an innocent person in prison or execute an innocent person because they’re protecting the rule of law.”
Questions about the guilt of a man on death row came to a head during court proceedings in St. Louis County in 2024. Marcellus “Khaliifah” Williams argued that his DNA was not on the knife used in a 1998 murder. When local prosecutors intervened on his behalf and pushed to have him re-sentenced to life without parole, officials from the attorney general’s office stepped in to block the deal. Williams was executed on Sept. 24. 
Bailey was elected to a second term in November. Since then, he has continued fighting wrongful convictions, including an open appeal in Christopher Dunn’s case asking the Missouri Supreme Court whether the attorney general’s office can fight the decision that vacated Dunn’s 1991 conviction. His release in 2024, like Hemme’s, was temporarily delayed after Bailey’s office intervened to block it.

Hemme recalled walking out of Chillicothe Correctional Center in northwest Missouri.
“I tell you what, I was so lightheaded. I felt so light that it was hard to explain,” she told The Marshall Project – St. Louis. “I felt like I was flying through air. It was so great.”
She said she spent her first months home catching up with relatives and taking life slow and easy. She also continued fighting her case.
In October, she made the trip to Kansas City for a Court of Appeals case brought by the attorney general’s office. Attorneys alleged the judge who set Hemme free had exceeded his authority. She calmly watched from the gallery as the judges listened to the evidence. 
The panel struck down the appeal, clearing the path for Hemme’s official exoneration, which came in December. 
Despite all that she has lost, Hemme quips that she is “blessed by the best and not tripping on the rest.” For now, she has been living with her sister and brother-in-law in Higginsville, a town of about 5,000 people about 45 minutes east of Kansas City. 
Eventually, she wants a place of her own.
 Hemme has been living with her sister and brother-in-law in Higginsville, a town of about 5,000 people in north-central Missouri (Emily Curiel/Kansas City Star).
She is ineligible for Social Security, having spent the majority of her working years in prison. A law signed by Gov. Mike Kehoe on March 26 makes her eligible for $176 for every day of wrongful incarceration. It repeals a provision that only those who prove their innocence through DNA testing qualify for payment. Under the new law, Hemme would have to give up her right to sue the state for damages and, because payments are capped at $65,000 a year, she would have to live into her 100s to recoup what she would be owed.
Hemme has been able to enjoy normal, everyday facets of life: celebrating Thanksgiving and Christmas, cheering on her Kansas City Chiefs and attending church on Sundays. Her faith, she said, is something that has always been important to her. She has also savored time with her mom, who lives a couple of towns over, and playing with her family’s dog, Lucky.
The colder winter months were more difficult because she was often stuck inside. She likes being outside and being able to take little walks. 
“It feels good to get out there and stretch,” she said, adding that even going outdoors while in custody was stressful because so many people were always around.
She’s becoming acquainted with new technology — like her smartphone, tablet and email — and making new friends during activities like bingo at the local senior center. On a recent Tuesday, participants marked off their cards as they chatted about families around town and local restaurants, some of which were unfamiliar to Hemme. She was pleased when she got to go up to a table of prizes after winning a round, picking out a small blue and white checkered quilt.
In late February, she turned 65. 
For many, it’s a milestone that signifies the end of a career. Hemme, though, is in the throes of quiet beginnings. She spent the day with a friend she made from the senior center, and her sister baked an angel food cake that evening. That weekend, her adult granddaughter took her out to eat. Hemme enjoyed a hamburger and onion rings.
One thing that still weighs on her: Other potentially innocent women remaining in prison. 
Hemme is one of 56 people who have been exonerated in Missouri since 1991, according to the National Registry of Exonerations. They lost upwards of 780 years of freedom collectively.

Mike Moon, R-Ash Grove, filibusters a report from the Senate Gubernatorial Appointments Committee Wednesday afternoon to block the appointment of a former Senate colleague (Annelise Hanshaw/Missouri Independent).A Republican state senator spent hours Wednesday trying to block the appointment of his former colleague to a county office over a grudge that goes back more than seven years. 
Shortly after 1 a.m., the filibuster sputtered and the appointment was confirmed by the Missouri Senate.
State Sen. Mike Moon, an Ash Grove Republican, sought to prevent former Senate President Pro Tem Dave Schatz from being confirmed to a spot on the Franklin County Commission.

Schatz was appointed to the job earlier this year by Republican Gov. Mike Kehoe.
Moon said he tried to work behind the scenes to express his distaste for the appointment. But he said no one listened, so he chose to force the issue. 
“I’ve tried,” Moon said on the Senate floor. “My words and my thoughts were not well taken.”
He began his filibuster Wednesday afternoon, laying out grievances against Schatz and reading emails from people he said were residents of Franklin County who wanted the Senate to support another candidate.
But in the end, the one-man filibuster only lasted until soon after midnight, when Moon began offering procedural motions that were repeatedly defeated by his GOP colleagues. After numerous failed attempts to set the appointment aside, the Senate confirmed Schatz around 1 a.m., adjourned for 10 minutes and returned to approve its journal and head home for the week.
The Moon-Schatz rivalry dates back to 2018, when Schatz added a provision to a bill that placed a gas tax increase on ballots statewide. Moon joined a conservative activist in an unsuccessful lawsuit, saying the amendment was beyond the bill’s original scope.
The Missouri Constitution states that: “No bill shall contain more than one subject which shall be clearly expressed in its title.”
Moon is a stickler for keeping bills to a single subject, sometimes voting against conservative legislation to send a message to abide by the state’s foundational document.
In 2022, Schatz’s last year in the legislature, he booted Moon from his committee assignments after Moon wore overalls on the Senate floor. Schatz had told Moon to change earlier in the day, but he pushed back.
“If someone comes to me and threatens me with infractions, or ramifications, for me just coming to the chamber, and doing the duty that I was called to do, that’s unacceptable,” Moon said at the time.
Schatz at the time called Moon’s reaction childlike.
It is rare for a senator to lose committee assignments, though it happened last year when Missouri Freedom Caucus members slowed the Senate to halt. A House member lost her spots on committee in 2021 after being indicted on federal medical fraud charges and another was censured after lying about a relationship with an intern.
Moon, who is prone to procedural skirmishes with Senate leadership, led a faction in 2021 that hoped to override then-Gov. Mike Parson’s veto and reimburse owners of wedding venues for legal fees in their fight with the Department of Revenue.
He hoped to buck tradition and call for a vote to override the veto, something that is traditionally done by the budget chair. Kehoe, who was lieutenant governor at the time, didn’t recognize Moon for the motion.
Schatz became the intermediary, eventually ruling in favor of Kehoe. For Moon, it was another sign of the chasm between Republican Senate leadership and the chamber’s conservative caucus.
Moon said he was standing up for Franklin County residents.
“You think I’m here to prove something else,” he said. “I’m not.”
Moon, seasoned in filibustering, held the floor for multiple hours Wednesday with periodic quorum calls approximately every 20 minutes to bring fellow senators back to the chamber.
Some senators’ offices received calls in support of Moon, asking them to turn down the nomination.
Moon read emails from Franklin County residents opposing Schatz. Many asked for Franklin County Clerk Tim Baker to be nominated instead. The Franklin County Republican Central Committee wrote letters in February asking Kehoe to pick Baker.
“How many more emails until you wake up and do the will of the people,” Moon said.
Facebook pages, such as “Patriot Mama Bears” and “Liberty Link Missouri PAC,” posted requests for followers to email Moon.
Schatz did not comment on Moon’s filibuster.

Wisconsin State Legislature — is the latest in an ongoing legal [&#8230;],"Wisconsin Attorney General Josh Kaul, who said the power issues in Wisconsin mirrors current federal issues, at a press conference in December 2024. (Photo by: Baylor Spears/Wisconsin Examiner)The Wisconsin Supreme Court heard arguments Wednesday in a case that could determine whether a law passed in 2018 that requires approval from legislators on civil settlements violates the separation of powers between the executive and legislative branches. 
The case — Josh Kaul v. Wisconsin State Legislature — is the latest in an ongoing legal struggle focused on the division of power between the Legislature and the executive branch.
A  law passed after Gov. Tony Evers and Attorney General Kaul were elected in 2018, but before they took office, gave the Legislature, through the Joint Finance Committee, the ability to sign off on and decide how to spend court settlement money. That had been a power traditionally held by the attorney general. 
It was part of a slate of laws passed and signed by Republicans during the lame duck period just weeks before the new Democratic administration took power in 2019. The Joint Finance Committee has become the vehicle for lawmakers to maintain control over  actions that agencies take outside of the legislative process, and this is not the first lawsuit the state’s top court has heard on the issue.
The case made it to the state Supreme Court after Kaul appealed a 2024 decision by the Wisconsin Court of Appeals District II that overturned a favorable decision made in 2022 by Dane County judge and now Justice-elect Susan Crawford.
Kaul said at a press conference after the arguments that the actions Wisconsin Republicans have taken to strip power from the executive branch are similar to those being taken by Republicans at the federal level. 
“What we are seeing in these cases in Wisconsin in a lot of ways mirrors what’s going on with the federal government right now,” Kaul said. “At the federal level what we’re seeing is the executive branch trying to pull legislative power into its own hands and making decisions about how legislation should be applied or whether it should be applied. Here in Wisconsin what we saw instead was an effort to concentrate power in the Legislature.” 
Kaul said that checks and balances and “multiple different sources of authority within the government” are necessary to protect the “our freedom and our liberty.”
“That’s why we have three co-equal branches of government,” Kaul said. “This case is about supporting that principle and ensuring that the separation of powers remains strong here in Wisconsin.” 
During the arguments, Assistant Attorney General Hannah Jurss argued that the “executive branch has the power to execute the law” and the “Legislature’s constitutional power is to write the law.” 
In a 2019 case, the state Supreme Court ruled that the law was constitutional. However, in a brief, Jurrs argues that the decision was not a broad endorsement of the law, but only “located a few instances where the statutes could be applied constitutionally and went no further.” 
Jurrs argued the law is unconstitutional in part because there is no way for the executive to override a decision by the lawmakers, which has infringed on the executive branch’s work. The 2018 law has led to disputes between Kaul’s office and lawmakers over resolving cases involving state taxpayers. 
“Having this sword, the legislative committee sword,  hanging over our head infects our decision making at every stage and every action… whether to prosecute, how to prosecute. How to talk with our clients, when to pursue negotiation, and the terms,” Jurrs said. “We’ve presented 13 cases that [the committee] as a body never even convened to consider.” 
Jurrs called the legislative seizure of executive powers  an “unprecedented and unparalleled intrusion into execution of the law.” She also argued that it limits the ability for the attorney general to act in multi-state lawsuits. 
Jurrs said that if the law had been in place in the 1990s when the state negotiated a tobacco resolution it would have led to a more complicated situation. 
“Hey, 44 other states, we’re entering this gigantic resolution with the major tobacco companies. We know that everybody else has come to this agreement. It has to be really confidential, but excuse us, we’re gonna have to hold everything and we have to take this to a committee of our Legislature so that they can decide whether they want to rewrite this agreement or allow us to enter it or not,” Jurrs said.
Justice Rebecca Bradley expressed skepticism about Jurrs’ argument that the power should lie with the attorney general without the oversight of lawmakers. 
“The Legislature in the provision that you’re attacking has prescribed the powers and duties of the attorney general, which is to basically give… the Legislature a check-and-balance on what the attorney general is doing and what I find frightening is that one person gets to make all of the policy decisions under your argument about what is going to be done with what is the taxpayers money,” Bradley said. “It’s not the attorney general’s money.” 
Misha Tseytlin, the attorney representing the Legislature, argued that the statute serves as a check on the attorney general’s power and lawmakers have an interest in overseeing the money.
“It’s important to remember we’re talking about not the attorney general’s money, not the agency’s money, but the people’s money,” Tseytlin said. He said an example is the $420 million opioid settlement that was reached and approved by lawmakers on the Joint Finance Committee in 2021.  “The settlement was submitted to the Joint Finance committee, and it was approved by The Joint Finance committee. The Legislature in carrying out its constitutional duty to balance the budget of the state had to take into account all sorts of income, including that $420 million.”
Justice Rebecca Dallet questioned Tseytlin on how much power he was arguing lawmakers should have over funds. 
“Any source of income that comes into the Legislature they’ve got control of, so could the Legislature appoint a committee to return tax returns to make sure they are getting the money that they’re supposed to?” Dallet asked. “My point in asking the question… is where does this end? Every single dollar that comes in means the Legislature has total control… There is no role for executive power here.”

Republicans looking to cut federal spending on Medicaid are eyeing work requirements as one possible option. (Justin Sullivan/Getty Images)Under an emerging Republican plan to require some Medicaid recipients to work, between 4.6 million and 5.2 million adults ages 19 to 55 could lose their health care coverage, according to a new analysis.
The study, conducted by Urban Institute researchers with support from the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation, calculated that up to 39% of the 13.3 million adults in that age group who became eligible for Medicaid when their states expanded the program under the Affordable Care Act would lose coverage if Congress required states to impose work rules.
The report suggests that most of those people would lose coverage not because they aren’t complying with the rules, but because they would struggle to report their compliance to the state.
“Most adults who would lose eligibility for federal Medicaid funding are working, engaged in work-related activities, or could qualify for exemptions not readily identifiable through state databases but could still face disenrollment because of the reporting requirements,” it states. The study identified several barriers to reporting, including lack of broadband access and lack of transportation.
Forty states plus the District of Columbia have expanded Medicaid under the ACA. Overall, nearly 72 million people, about a fifth of Americans, are enrolled in the program for low-income people, which is funded jointly by the federal government and the states.
Traditional Medicaid insurance was mainly available to children and their caregivers, people with disabilities and pregnant women. But the ACA, commonly known as Obamacare, allowed states to extend coverage to adults making up to 138% of the federal poverty level — about $21,000 a year for a single person.
Nationwide, more than 21 million people with low incomes have health insurance because of expanded Medicaid eligibility.
U.S. House Republicans in February pushed through a budget plan, now under consideration in the Senate, that would require about $880 billion in cuts to Medicaid over the next decade to help cover the cost of $4.5 trillion in tax cuts. The budget doesn’t contain specifics on how that target would be met. But work requirements are a likely money-saving option: A 2023 analysis from the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office found that imposing work rules on Medicaid recipients ages 19 to 55 who are not parents or caregivers would cut federal spending by an estimated $109 billion over the next 10 years.
The Congressional Budget Office based that projection on a plan the GOP-controlled U.S. House approved in 2023. That bill, the likely blueprint for the work requirements Republicans are considering now, would have required adults ages 19-55 to work, participate in a job training program or perform community service for at least 80 hours per month for three or more months in a calendar year. Parents and caretakers of dependent children, and those unable to work because of a health condition, would have been exempt.
Many Republican-led states are eager to impose work requirements on able-bodied Medicaid recipients. Thirteen states received permission to impose work rules on at least some Medicaid enrollees during the first Trump administration. Nine additional states requested permission to enact Medicaid work requirements during Trump’s earlier term but had not won approval by the time it ended.
When the Biden administration came into office, it rescinded all the approvals.
Supporters say requiring Medicaid recipients to work, study or train for a career gives them a boost toward self-sufficiency and financial stability. Critics, however, say such rules end up hurting far more people than they help.
The researchers from the Urban Institute mostly based their analysis on the experience of Arkansas, which in June 2018 became the first state to require some Medicaid recipients to work, volunteer, go to school or participate in job training to receive benefits. By the time a federal judge halted the policy in April 2019, 18,000 adults had lost coverage.
The researchers also looked at New Hampshire, which began implementing a work requirement but halted the program in July 2019 before suspending anyone’s coverage.
“What was found in a lot of qualitative research on the previous work requirement programs is that a lot of people were unaware of the policy, or they didn’t understand the policy,” said Michael Karpman, an Urban Institute researcher who co-authored the study.
“People who need coverage the most would do the most to try to maintain it. On the other hand, those people could also face the most difficulty with the administrative barriers,” Karpman said.
In a 2020 study examining how Arkansas’ last experience with work requirements played out, researchers from the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health “found no evidence that the policy succeeded in its stated goal of promoting work and instead found substantial evidence of harm to health care coverage and access.”
Arkansas Republican Gov. Sarah Huckabee Sanders announced in January that she would ask the federal government for permission to institute work requirements, regardless of what Congress decides. The state submitted the request last week.










Especially for a rural state like Arkansas, work requirements fail to take into account a lot of the realities that people may face.


– Christin Harper, policy director for Arkansas Advocates for Children and Families


Arkansas Republican state Rep. Aaron Pilkington, who serves on the health committee in his chamber, said lawmakers “learned our lesson from the last go-round.”
Pilkington said that under the new proposal, the state will only pause coverage instead of canceling it, giving recipients an opportunity to prove they are complying. And, he said, the online portal for reporting will be a lot more user-friendly.
“I think it’s a reasonable thing to ask for able-bodied people to look for work, or try to obtain work,” Pilkington said.
But Christin Harper, policy director for Arkansas Advocates for Children and Families, said even the new version would be a challenge for many enrollees. Many people on Medicaid are juggling multiple jobs, and having to report to the state every month would be a significant burden.
“Especially for a rural state like Arkansas, work requirements fail to take into account a lot of the realities that people may face,” Harper said. She added that “with the overall job market, job opportunities may or may not be available in some of these rural towns.”

(Getty Images)Gov. Tony Evers is asking Wisconsin counties to give up a practice they’ve relied on for years: clawing back money from the absent fathers of children whose mothers were Medicaid recipients when they gave birth.
The practice is called birth cost recovery. When Medicaid covers the birth of a child and the father doesn’t live with the rest of the family, county social service departments and the courts may add a requirement to repay Medicaid to a father’s child support order.
In his 2025-27 state budget proposal, Evers wants to end the practice, and he’s offering counties a deal to give it up: a nearly $4 million boost for child support agencies.
Although permitted under federal law, only two states now authorize the use of birth cost recovery: Kansas and Wisconsin. Proponents of the practice have argued that it’s only fair to try to recoup state funds spent on the birth of a child if the child’s father can afford it.
But research at the Reproductive Equity Action Lab (REAL) questions the benefits of birth cost recovery when compared to the potential harm it can cause. The lab is affiliated with the University of Wisconsin School of Medicine and Public Health.
“This is a policy that takes money out of low-income families’ hands in the state of Wisconsin to pay the state back for the social services they receive,” Klaira Lerma, the lab’s associate director, told the Wisconsin Examiner. “This creates financial strain on families, and families view it as government greed.”
This week REAL published a policy brief on birth cost recovery. The brief summarizes research by the lab’s director, Professor Tiffany Green, along with Lerma and other contributors, that contradicts assumptions proponents have made.
There were 14,880 unmarried Wisconsin residents who gave birth in 2023. The brief reported that unmarried parents already tend to have lower incomes than married parents, making a birth cost recovery debt especially challenging.
Wisconsin gives counties the option to use birth cost recovery, but doesn’t require it. If a county takes the option, 15% of the money it recovers goes to the county’s child support program, while 85% goes back to the state Medicaid program.
ABC for Health, a Madison-based nonprofit public interest law firm, has been campaigning against birth cost recovery for more than a decade and succeeded in persuading Wisconsin’s two largest counties to drop the practice. Dane County stopped filing new birth cost recovery claims in 2020 and stopped pursuing old outstanding cases in 2023. Milwaukee County quit the practice in 2024.
As part of their investigation of the practice, REAL researchers interviewed 40 Wisconsin parents who had been subject to birth cost recovery.
Parents who live together aren’t subject to birth cost recovery — only noncustodial fathers. Lerma said parents told them they weren’t even aware they might be on the hook to repay Medicaid until there was a formal court order for child support.
“They described a lack of transparency and feeling bamboozled” when they were told about paying back Medicaid, Lerma said.
“Parents clearly described how Birth Cost Recovery payments reduce fathers’ ability to financially support their child(ren) by taking money out of their budget,” the policy brief states.
“You’re taking away the way somebody can feed their family,” one parent is quoted as saying. “You’re taking away child care, how somebody can provide for their family. You’re taking away [money for] health care.”
Another told researchers that a birth cost recovery payment “going back to the state is money that can be put into the child.”
For fathers in low-wage jobs, having to pay off a birth cost recovery debt “puts them in risk of losing housing, the ability to put food on the table,” a parent told the researchers.
“It also causes many marginalized fathers to throw up their hands and leave the lives of their children. And eventually, they may get caught, held in contempt. And once again, that whole cycle just starts,” the parent said. “They’re not going to get a job. They have this on their record. They’re not going to get housing. They’ll be always underemployed.”
Lerma said that in families covered by Medicaid, children are more likely to be at risk for illness. Birth cost recovery, she said, is effectively “taxing these families who are more likely to be facing significantly worse health outcomes.”
The brief cites research that found the financial strain from having to pay a birth cost recovery debt was associated with lower employment levels and less ability to maintain child support payments.
“In contrast, evidence shows eliminating Birth Cost Recovery appears to increase child support compliance,” the brief states.
“Ending Birth Cost Recovery across the state may reduce harm on Wisconsin families and result in more child support money going to children and their custodial parent,” the brief concludes.
To offset the expected loss counties would experience by giving up birth cost recovery entirely, Evers’ budget proposal sets aside $3.8 million over the two-year budget for county child support programs.
The brief says implementing that proposal could ensure “that county child support agencies remain fiscally solvent to carry out their mission.”

(Leslie Bonilla Muñiz/Indiana Capital Chronicle)Legislation to study the absorption of secessionist Illinois counties heads to the Indiana Senate’s floor after a 7-2 committee vote Wednesday. Companion legislation in the Prairie State is already dead, however.
“I’ll just say this: things are better in Indiana then they are in Illinois,” said Sen. Scott Baldwin, R-Noblesville. “It’s no surprise” people want to move.
“We want to open the doors if they want to come here,” Baldwin added. He is sponsoring House Bill 1008 — a priority for the House GOP — on its Senate journey.

The proposal would create an Indiana-Illinois Boundary Adjustment Commission tasked with exploring the secession and transfer of counties that have already voted to leave the state of Illinois. Since 2020, 33 Illinois counties have passed “advisory referenda” to leave the state — seven of those votes occurred in the most recent general election.
As he clicked through a series of slides, Baldwin said Illinois residents like Indiana’s lower taxes, balanced budget, “great” road funding system, job opportunities and political representation.
“Many residents feel Chicago’s policies do not align with their values,” he added. “The Indiana General Assembly prides itself on being a body that serves its constituents.”
Indiana stands to gain, according to Baldwin. He listed increased tax revenue, strengthened sports culture, political “alignment,” and reduced Chicago influence.
Democrats — who later voted “no” — were skeptical.
Sen. LaKeisha Jackson, D-Indianapolis, cited an analysis from prominent conservative economist Michael Hicks, who directs the Center for Business and Economic Research at Ball State University.
Illinois secession bill passes first hurdle

He found that the secessionist counties would be equivalent to the nation’s second-poorest state. Adding them to Indiana would drop the state’s per capita income.
Baldwin said they’re doing poorly “in their current fiscal arrangement.”
One pro-secession witness said the counties are “held back by Illinois regulation and tax rates.”
But a border shakeup is unlikely.
Illinois Gov. J.B. Pritzker previously called Indiana’s legislation “a stunt” that is “not going to happen.” He’d need to bless the move, but companion legislation is already dead. Congress would also need to approve.
Committee leader Sen. Ron Alting said a second witness had signed up as Pritzker himself.
“Is he here?” asked Alting, R-Lafayette, to laughter.
House Bill 1008 was edited to add more commission members and require a first meeting by September. It heads to the Senate floor for further consideration.

(Getty Images)This year, the U.S. Congress has a unique opportunity to strike a significant — and swift — blow against cancer.
Last Congress, U.S. Sen. Mike Crapo, R-Idaho, led efforts to advance legislation establishing access to multi-cancer early detection (MCED) tests. The Medicare Multi-Cancer Early Detection Screening Coverage Act would make a meaningful difference in how cancer is screened for and detected. The bill has sweeping support — both inside and outside of Congress — and, after enormous progress last session, it is ready for quick enactment this year.

Sen. Crapo’s bill would remove regulatory red tape and create a pathway for MCED tests to be available to those who need them most.
For the nearly 1 million Medicare beneficiaries who will be diagnosed with cancer this year, access to these life-changing tests could mean catching their illnesses earlier — when it can be more easily treated. Catching cancer earlier not only improves a patient’s chance of successful treatment, it also reduces the costly burden of cancer care, often helping patients and families avert expensive late-stage treatments and, more importantly, preserving hope and health.
Today’s screening methods are the best tool we have against cancer, yet only five cancers — breast, cervical, colorectal, lung, and prostate — currently have broadly accessible methods. Because of this, more than 70% of U.S. cancer deaths are caused by cancers without approved early detection methods. Many patients with these cancers aren’t diagnosed until their cancer is at a more advanced stage, requiring more invasive treatment – and all the physical, emotional, and financial strain that comes with it.
Here in Idaho, residents experience higher rates of some cancer types compared to the national average. If broad access to MCED tests becomes available, more Idahoans could have a better chance at beating the disease before it advances to more dangerous stages.
MCED blood tests can detect the presence and location of dozens of cancer types with a high degree of accuracy. Because the test requires only a simple blood draw, it is easy to administer in rural areas and in smaller clinics that may not have specialized equipment. This accessibility is particularly crucial in states like Idaho, where large portions of the population live far from major health care centers.
Early detection dramatically increases the likelihood of successful treatment, a fact underscored by the support for this legislation from medical associations across the state. Endorsers include the Idaho Academy of Family Physicians, Idaho Center for Nursing, Idaho Medical Association, Idaho Society of Clinical Oncology, American Nurses Association of Idaho, Nurse Leaders of Idaho, and the Nurse Practitioners of Idaho – all of which recognize the potential of MCED tests to improve patient outcomes.
The Medicare Multi-Cancer Early Detection Screening Coverage Act would allow Medicare to cover MCED tests once they are approved by the FDA. This coverage is critical because most cancer diagnoses occur in people aged 65 and older. Enabling Medicare coverage would provide seniors with access to the latest in life-changing cancer screening technology — in the same way that it can be available in the private sector. This could level the playing field for older Americans, providing them with more options to catch cancer early and pursue treatment in its most manageable stages.
In the last Congress, nearly 400 lawmakers and over 500 advocacy organizations supported Sen. Crapo’s bill. It has also already been deeply vetted by Congressional committees. With such a strong foundation of support — and an urgent need for better cancer detection — this legislation is now ready for swift passage.
Congress has the chance to secure an early and meaningful victory against cancer by passing this legislation now – potentially saving countless lives and sparing families the devastation of late-stage cancer diagnoses.
Thanks to Sen. Crapo’s immense leadership, the Medicare Multi-Cancer Early Detection Screening Coverage Act is teed up for quick enactment this year. Idaho’s cancer advocacy community is hopeful that Congress will now seize the moment without delay.

(Photo by Scott Olson/Getty Images)It turns out Elon Musk, the richest man in the world, is not so powerful after all. 
Musk’s gambit in Wisconsin — dumping more than $20 million into a nominally nonpartisan Supreme Court race, blanketing the airwaves with negative ads, paying people to sign petitions against “activist judges” and cavorting in Green Bay wearing a cheesehead hat while handing out million-dollar checks to Republican voters — didn’t help, and likely hurt, his chosen candidate in an election Musk described as crucial to “the course of Western civilization” and “the entire destiny of humanity.”
Poor Brad Schimel, whose campaign Musk took over. At his victory party in the Republican stronghold of Waukesha, where he underperformed Trump’s 2024 vote tally, setting up his quick downhill slide, Schimel sat strumming a guitar as the results came in showing that Susan Crawford trounced him by a whopping 10 points. 
After proclaiming that he got into the race because he was disgusted by the Court’s “partisanship,” Schimel ended up promising to be a “support network” for Trump and stood by as Musk became his biggest donor and the public face of his campaign. At some point Tuesday evening he may have begun to regret that approach. Trump himself seems to be rethinking Musk after the debacle in Wisconsin, reportedly telling his inner circle that his billionaire adviser won’t be around much longer.
Other Republicans would be wise to get the message that “Elon Musk is politically toxic, that he is a massive anchor that will drag Republicans to the bottom of the ocean,” Ben Wikler, chair of the Democratic Party of Wisconsin, told the Examiner during Crawford’s victory party. 
Wisconsin voters are not alone in recoiling from Musk as he takes a chainsaw to federal health care programs and Social Security, gleefully slashing the safety net to fund giant tax breaks for a handful of super-rich people like himself. In 10 Wisconsin counties where Trump won in 2024, voters rejected Musk’s entreaties to support Schimel, delivering a majority of votes to Crawford. That included Republican-leaning Brown County, where Musk campaigned in his cheesehead hat.
“I think the whole country is going to know unmistakably that Musk and Trump have crossed line after line after line, and the blowback has begun,” said Wikler. “Wisconsin is a bellwether state. Whoever wins Wisconsin probably wins the country, and Trump and Musk just lost decisively. At this point, every Republican who hasn’t yet spoken out against Elon Musk is going to have to think through whether they want to stay in public life or they want this to be their final term in office.”
But don’t count on Wisconsin U.S. Sen. Ron Johnson to do any of that sort of hard thinking. Johnson told Lawrence Andrea of the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel that Musk was “net beneficial” to Schimel, and that his 10-point loss might have been even bigger without Musk’s help. Likewise Wisconsin Right Now declared that there was no lesson to be learned from Schimel’s loss and chalked it up to the inevitable backlash by angry liberals to Trump and Musk’s bravery. 
That kind of analysis bodes well for Democrats.
After Tuesday, the liberal majority on the Wisconsin Supreme Court is secure for another three years, just as it is poised to decide key cases on abortion, labor rights and Wisconsin’s gerrymandered congressional maps. Celebrating on stage with Crawford at the Park Hotel in Madison Tuesday night were the other women who make up that majority, including Justices Jill Karofsky and Janet Protasiewicz, who each won the last two Supreme Court elections by 10 points or more against a right-wing opponent, just as Crawford did. 
In all three races a key issue was Wisconsin women’s right to control their own bodies, with voters decisively rejecting candidates who embraced a dangerous near-total abortion ban. In all three races money also played an outsized role — a growing threat to voters’ ability to make their voices heard over the din of deceptive big-money ads. If we are going to reclaim the Court from the corrupting influence of self-interested donors like Musk — who is currently pursuing a lawsuit to try to overturn a Wisconsin law that prevents him from selling Teslas directly to consumers — we need to put an end to the campaign finance arms race.
But for now the most important lesson of the 2025 Supreme Court race is that voters can stand up to the mind-boggling spree of destruction by MAGA nihilists. 
Musk’s failure to buy a seat on the Court should encourage people across the country to believe in themselves and their ability to resist the authoritarian bullies who are targeting civil society, flouting the law, trampling our rights and trying to rule by intimidation and the sheer force of their money.
It didn’t work in Wisconsin. That’s a good sign.

(Lindsey Toomer/Colorado Newsline)The Colorado Senate began debate Wednesday on the annual state budget bill, a spending plan that tries to close a $1.2 billion funding gap and absorb the rising cost of Medicaid in the state.
The bill, known as the “long bill,” and the dozens of accompanying pieces of legislation creates a $43.9 billion budget for the fiscal year that begins in July, about a 3.6% increase from last year.
That includes about $16 billion in general fund spending. As it stands, the general fund would end the next fiscal year with about $2.5 million above the required reserve amount.
“I’ve said this a number of times and I will keep saying it: This is a budget that no one will like but we can all be proud of,” Sen. Jeff Bridges, a Greenwood Village Democrat, told his colleagues in a caucus meeting on Tuesday. “That is because we took a $1.2 billion-in-the-hole starting point and have managed to deliver a budget that maintains our commitment to K-12, maintains our commitment to Medicaid and maintains our commitment to higher ed. We have done that largely through some pretty painful ongoing cuts, combined with one-time transfers.”
SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
The budget includes $150 million in new K-12 spending and a 1.6% Medicaid provider rate increase. Those are lower increases than advocates hoped for, but it is not the apocalyptic scenario some feared. The larger picture of education funding is left to the School Finance Act, which has not yet been introduced.
The Senate gave preliminary approval to the budget on Wednesday night. It still needs to undergo a formal recorded vote before heading to the House for consideration.
It is written by the six-member, bicameral Joint Budget Committee, which includes Democrats and Republicans, after months of meetings and presentations from state departments and agencies. The primary goal this year was to craft a balanced budget as required by the state constitution while facing down a massive funding gap created by ballooning costs of state programs like Medicaid.
Part of the issue is that Colorado is constrained by the Taxpayer’s Bill of Rights, which restricts how much revenue the state can keep based on inflation and population growth. That revenue cap is not rising as fast as those program costs, at the same time pandemic-era federal funding dries up. This year, the general fund appropriation for the Department of Health Care Policy and Financing, which administers Medicaid, is larger than the one for the Department of Education for the first time. It would grow by 6.8% under the proposed budget.
But TABOR limitations should not be blamed for the budget woes, Republicans argue. Rather, they say the blame should be on the expanding state government and the associated spending.
“We’ve created a structural deficit with the way we’ve been spending over the last six years. We need to restrain our spending, not claim that we need more money,” Minority Leader Paul Lundeen, a Monument Republican, said ahead of debate on Wednesday.
A dozen departments reduced
Most of Wednesday was spent debating amendments to the long bill, attempts by individual lawmakers to put their mark on the budget and signal the programs and investments that are important — or not — to them. That ranged from failed amendments to cease funding transgender health care in the Department of Corrections to a successful one that would create more spending for Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program administration.
The House will vote on its own series of amendments to the long bill and then the bill will head to a conference committee made of JBC members. It’s rare that budget amendments stick around until the final version that heads to the governor’s desk.
Overall, about a dozen departments will see a budget reduction compared to last year.
The budget balances itself by proposing various repeals and adjustments to current programs, including some that were only recently created through legislation. One cut changes the state’s responsibility to cover 75% of phone calls for incarcerated people, instead of 100% as passed into law in 2023, and would save about $2.3 million. Another repeals the Kidney Disease Task Force formed in 2021.
The state’s transportation department is poised to absorb a large share of the budget cuts. One cut would slash about $64 million in the budget by adjusting the schedule of transfers of general fund money to the State Highway Fund, which was created through 2021 legislation that requires a certain amount of investment over a decade. The state will eventually meet that investment obligation, but on an adjusted schedule. It wouldn’t be on the hook for $50 million earmarked for next year, for example.
The budget would also eliminate $7 million for the Revitalizing Main Street program, which helps local communities improve their downtown infrastructure.
And it takes back about $71 million in awarded transportation grants to local governments for small-scale improvements like bike lanes and walking paths. That money has been awarded but the projects are not under contract.
“These are great investments, valuable stuff. But given the budget shortfall we have this year, we identified this as a place where an investment we made some years ago, we can probably put those dollars to better use this year,” Bridges said. “If you can find $72 million worth of cuts somewhere else, then let’s talk. But this is the single largest piece we will be transferring into the general fund.”
About $34 million would be cut from the Healthy School Meals for All program in the Department of Education, which provides free breakfast and lunch for public school students. It leaves $8 million to sustain the program until December. Voters will likely face a ballot question this fall proposing to raise more tax dollars to fund the program.
Senators wrestled with a cut that would repeal Medicaid coverage for services provided by community health workers as defined in a 2023 law, which would save about $11.7 million in the upcoming budget year and $13.7 million in the 2026-2027 fiscal year. That reimbursement program was passed in 2023 and was set to be implemented starting this July.
An amendment to fund community health workers for at least the first year using excess general fund reserve was approved.
“We know the benefits that community health workers are to all our communities, whether it’s Front Range or rural. They offer wraparound services, whether it’s social services, transportation, other things that lead to better outcomes for the people of Colorado,” said Sen. Kyle Mullica, a Thornton Democrat.
Democrats control strong majorities in both the House and Senate.

(Photo: Tennessee Department of Correction)Despite a major increase in prison officer salaries, the Tennessee Department of Correction is hitting personnel shortages, forcing it to bring in a “floating security crew” at state facilities.
A five-person group of correctional officers volunteered to assist staff in March at the Northwest Correctional Complex in Tiptonville, which has capacity for 1,776 male inmates, including juvenile offenders convicted as adults, the department confirmed.
The state is hiring 20 more correctional officers to serve on the “floating security crew,” and depending on experience their pay could range from $4,675 to $5,300 a month, up to $63,600 a year, about 20% more than the average pay for officers, according to the department.
Officers on the crew travel to locations where they are needed based on staffing levels, and applications for the job are available on the Department of Correction’s website.
The department wouldn’t say whether Northwest Correctional had suffered any security breakdowns or major incidents because of the staffing shortage.
Shortages come at a time the state is requiring inmates to serve longer terms because of the so-called “truth and sentencing” law and support for a constitutional amendment that would enable judges to deny bail to more offenders.
Republican Sen. Ed Jackson of Jackson, chairman of a legislative committee on prisons, said Northwest Correctional has a history of correctional officer vacancies.
“It’s just hard to get people in that part of the state to go in as correctional officers. I know they’ve struggled up there quite a bit over the last three or four years,” Jackson said.
The state increased officer salaries and held recruiting events in West Tennessee to hire more officers, but couldn’t keep the staffing level up to standards, Jackson added. He was uncertain whether additional pay increases would solve the problem.
  “It’s just hard to get people in that part of the state” to serve as correction officers, said Sen. Ed Jackson, a Jackson Republican. (Photo: John Partipilo)
The department announced in January it was putting $37 million more into salary increases for correctional officers and security personnel, effective Feb. 16, raising starting salaries to $51,204 with additional increases that would bump pay to $60,720 after 18 months. Current staff was to see a 10% increase or be brought up to the new base salary, according to the department.
The pay increase came on the heels of a 35% pay booster two years ago.
Correction Commissioner Frank Strada told lawmakers in February state-run prisons have a 26% vacancy rate for  correction officers compared to 33.7% at Trousdale Turner, a facility run by the state’s private contractor, CoreCivic. The Trousdale prison remains under a civil rights investigation by the U.S. Department of Justice.
“This investment in our people recognizes the value of correctional professionals and demonstrates the support we have received from the Governor’s Office and the General Assembly,” Strada said in a January letter to employees.
Strada said in the letter the pay increase would make the Department of Correction one of the highest-paying correctional agencies in the Southeast.
The Tennessee State Employees Association called the raises an “important step” toward dealing with the challenge of recruiting and keeping employees at state prisons.
The department is requesting a $6.8 million contract increase for its private prison operator even though it penalized the company $44.78 million since 2022 for contractual shortfalls, $15 million the last month alone, mainly for personnel shortages.
CoreCivic refuses to disclose what it pays officers, and similarly to the state, it brings personnel from other states to boost staff when it has shortages. Trousdale Turner sustained a 146% turnover rate in 2023.

Nov. 9, 2021 | Ken ColemanThe abrupt closure of a regional office for the federal agency overseeing Head Start child care and early education programs in Michigan could lead to disruptions in service.
The National Head Start Association said the Chicago office overseeing programs in six states, including Michigan, was abruptly shuttered earlier this week as part of Health Secretary Robert Kennedy’s cuts at the Department of Health and Human Services, which oversees the Administration for Children and Families, or ACF, the agency that administers the Office of Head Start.
Chicago’s office also oversees programs in Illinois, Indiana, Minnesota, Ohio and Wisconsin.
A statement from the NHSA warned that the closures could cause “disruption to vital services for eligible children and families across the country.”
Aundreana Jones-Poole, a communications manager for the Michigan Department of Lifelong Education, Advancement, and Potential, or MiLEAP, said the state “is working to understand the impact of this week’s federal actions on Michigan families at this time.”
Four other regional offices were also shuttered Tuesday. Regional offices in Boston, New York, San Francisco and Seattle faced the same fate as the Chicago office, according to the NHSA.
Josh Cowen, a professor of education policy at Michigan State University, said the closures create “a walk the walk moment for anyone claiming to care about kids and families.”
The NHSA said the regional offices “play a critical role in providing oversight, guidance and direct support to local Head Start programs,” including helping to interpret federal regulations and providing support to Head Start grant recipients.
There are 53 Head Start providers in Michigan. More than 70,000 children in Michigan are served by the federal Head Start and Child Development and Care programs, Jones-Poole said.
“In order to avoid disrupting services for children and families, we urge the administration to reconsider these actions until a plan has been created and shared widely,” the NHSA’s statement reads.
But Cowen, who has written extensively on efforts to undermine public education, said the administration of President Donald Trump “isn’t interested in policy solutions for kids and families that aren’t built on moms staying at home or tax dollars going to private schools.”
“I interpret anything other than strong statements condemning the closing of ACF offices as support for doing it—and by extension support for gutting Head Start, child care and the rest,” Cowen said.
The Head Start program was created 60 years ago to provide early education and other support for children living in low-income households.

(Zach Wendling/Nebraska Examiner)LINCOLN — The path forward for a medical cannabis bill in the Nebraska Legislature appears more uncertain after a committee chair tasked his members with deciding what medical conditions would qualify for access in the state and which forms of medical cannabis would be allowed.
State Sen. Rick Holdcroft of Bellevue, chair of the Legislature’s General Affairs Committee, described that task to his seven fellow committee members Wednesday. He provided them lists to choose a handful from the “debilitating medical conditions” approved in neighboring Iowa, as well as what he said were the 42 conditions approved across the 38 other states with medical cannabis laws.
  State Sen. Rick Holdcroft of Bellevue, center. March 10, 2025. (Zach Wendling/Nebraska Examiner)
Holdcroft described the comprehensive list as “everything but the kitchen sink” in talking with the Nebraska Examiner, explaining that the “people were silent” on what medical conditions would apply when they overwhelmingly adopted legalizing medical cannabis in November.
“We make it legal for anything and everything, it’s essentially recreational marijuana at that point,” Holdcroft said, a stance advocates of the ballot measure argue is wrong.
Legislative Bill 677, from State Sen. Ben Hansen of Blair, an effort aiming to flesh out a state regulatory scheme for medical cannabis, already faced an uphill climb to get out of committee among conservatives. Hansen, a Republican with a more Libertarian bent, said he still hopes to get his bill out of committee as “clean and popular as we can.”
Some advocates who championed the 2024 ballot measure say their support of the bill could be in jeopardy if Holdcroft’s more limited approach is taken up. They and Hansen continue to hunt for a path forward that remains closer to voters’ intent.
“It’s almost like whatever we kick out of committee is going to be ‘the’ bill that I would like to see, that the industry would like to see, that the people who voted for it would like to see,” Hansen said. “And that the Legislature can live with, at least 33 people can.”
Holdcroft voiced his goal to get an amended version of LB 677 advanced by the end of next week. Any version would need at least five votes.
‘The people have spoken’
Crista Eggers, executive director of Nebraskans for Medical Marijuana and 2024 campaign manager for the ballot measure, said the task that Holdcroft gave to his committee is disrespectful and that those concessions, among others, should be off the table.
She said advocates didn’t work so hard, gathering petition signatures and stories of pain and suffering from Nebraskans, to let a few senators decide who should be helped. Eggers has advocated on behalf of her youngest son, Colton, and said she’d never tell someone one child’s life was more worthy than someone else’s.
“Shame on them for trying to do that,” Eggers said.

Eggers thanked Hansen for all his work in hearing from supporters, respecting ballot language and helping advocates. But she said the time for other lawmakers to voice opinions on what is “right” is long overdue.
Lawmakers had their chance, but they repeatedly pushed supporters away, Eggers explained, and “essentially shut the door on our face each and every time” until the ballot was the only option.
The measure to legalize up to 5 ounces of medical cannabis with a health care practitioner’s recommendation passed with more than 71% of the vote, including majority support in all 49 legislative districts. A second measure, to set up the regulatory scheme through a new Nebraska Medical Cannabis Commission, passed with 67%. It got majority support in 46 legislative districts.
Eggers said that while the campaign thought companion legislation to clarify the state’s regulatory approach could be a “best scenario” to help enact the will of the people, she said some lawmakers had gone too far.
“We are not in a position any longer, now that the people have spoken, to let our initiative be gutted into something that is not at all what the people passed,” Eggers said.
‘Keep it small, keep it restricted’
Holdcroft said he would like his committee to wade through the lists and identify about six conditions that would qualify for access to medical cannabis, though he said he wouldn’t object to the Iowa list of:

Cancer, if the underlying condition or treatment produces severe or chronic pain, nausea or severe vomiting, or cachexia or severe wasting.
Seizures, including epilepsy.
Multiple sclerosis with severe or persistent muscle spasms.
AIDS or HIV.
Crohn’s disease.
Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), or Lou Gehrig’s disease.
Any terminal illness, with a probable life expectancy of under one year, if the illness or its treatment produces severe or chronic pain, nausea or severe vomiting, or cachexia or severe wasting.
Parkinson’s disease.
Chronic pain.
Post-traumatic stress disorder.
Severe, intractable autism with self-injurious or aggressive behaviors (including pediatric).
Ulcerative colitis.
Corticobasal degeneration.

Iowa state law also creates a path to expanding conditions via a recommendation by the Iowa Medical Cannabidiol Board and later adoption by the Iowa Board of Medicine.
“I think the approach should be: Keep it small, keep it restricted and do floor amendments if they want to expand it,” Holdcroft said.
  State Sen. Jared Storm of David City, center. March 26, 2025. (Zach Wendling/Nebraska Examiner)
According to Holdcroft’s second list, cancer, epilepsy or seizures and HIV or AIDS are listed in “every” state; multiple sclerosis is listed in “nearly” all states; chronic pain, PTSD and Chrohn’s disease or inflammatory bowel disease are listed in “most” states; and Parkinson’s disease, glaucoma or ALS are listed in “many” states.
Other conditions on Holdcroft’s lists range from sleep apnea, menstrual pain, sickle cell disease, tinnitus or “any condition for which a physician would otherwise prescribe an opioid” to Lewy body disease, Alzheimer’s, addiction recovery, hepatitis C or Huntington’s disease.
“Conditions like severe nausea, cachexia/wasting syndrome and terminal illness are also frequently included,” Holdcroft’s handouts state.
Holdcroft said three conditions are likely must-haves: childhood epilepsy, terminal cancer and lifelong chronic pain.
Part of that is because children with debilitating seizures were the face of the campaign, as moms and dads led the charge for more than 11 years at the statehouse.
One condition that Holdcroft cast doubt on and said would need to be more specific: PTSD, or post-traumatic stress disorder.
Holdcroft said the lists are not final, or even preliminary, but should serve as a starting point.
‘Do as little as necessary’
State Sen. John Cavanaugh of Omaha, committee vice chair, said lawmakers should do as little as needed to give structure to voters’ wishes but not “undermine” or “walk back” their will. He noted voters purposefully approved up to 5 ounces of cannabis and no specific conditions.
Edison McDonald, executive director of the Arc of Nebraska, said during the bill’s hearing not to limit the conditions to prevent needing annual bills to expand the list.

Cavanaugh said the arbitrary deliberations could exclude voters who specifically supported the measures for themselves or loved ones.
“I think when you start picking arbitrary numbers of maladies that will qualify, that is a disservice,” he said.
Cavanaugh said he always thinks of one of his constituents alongside marijuana regulations. He described her as somebody’s grandma in a fancy house in the Dundee neighborhood in Omaha, “not somebody you would necessarily think of as an advocate for legal cannabis.” She was, he said, for her husband who had stomach cancer and had tried many drugs to help.
Cavanaugh’s district in midtown Omaha had the highest support for the regulatory measure.
“My approach would be to do as little as necessary to make sure that people are going to be able to access this safely and legally,” Cavanaugh said.
He suggested delegating authority for putting together or researching qualifying conditions to the new Medical Cannabis Commission.
What senators can ‘live with’
Hansen said he is working hard with committee members to see what they can “live with,” but if those changes differ with what he or advocates can live with, then the bill will be adjusted during debate.
However, as recent filibuster-plagued sessions have shown, opponents can use legislative rules to block how many amendments can be added, further complicating the bill’s path toward securing the 33 votes it would need to become law.
Under the Nebraska Constitution, amending voter-approved laws requires two-thirds of the 49-member Legislature.

Hansen said it may be necessary to get something passed first, to set up the rules and regulations and get the framework established, and not “eat the whole apple in one setting.”
Hansen repeated the importance of getting something passed in 2025 as the voter-approved regulatory law is set to take effect in less than three months, making it virtually impossible for the new Medical Cannabis Commission — which has taken zero steps toward regulations — to have formal guidance in place by July 1. State licensing is supposed to begin by Oct. 1.
The Attorney General’s Office has threatened to sue if the cannabis commission begins licensing.
Holdcroft said the bill being considered would delay both the regulatory and licensing deadlines by at least three months.
The law legalizing medical cannabis with a written doctor’s note took effect Dec. 12, in all forms and for all conditions. However, with no guidance from the Nebraska Department of Health and Human Services, many advocates have told the Nebraska Examiner that doctors are refusing to recommend the drug that would need to be purchased out of state.
Holdcroft has suggested lowering the 5-ounce authorization to 300 milligrams, a limit that was suggested by freshman State Sen. Jared Storm of David City via LB 483. Holdcroft also suggested beginning at pills, oils or tinctures as part of Storm’s bill and expanding from there.
Smoking as a permissible form of use is a roadblock for a majority of the committee.

Recreational marijuana
Much of the hesitation revolves around fear of legalizing recreational marijuana, which Hansen noted many on the committee “vehemently oppose” — as do Nebraska Attorney General Mike Hilgers and U.S. Sen. Pete Ricketts, R-Neb., who are urging the Legislature to pass no cannabis-related laws this spring.
Hansen said avoidance could risk potential legal challenges or public backlash, one of the “fastest ways” he said to get voters to consider recreational marijuana.
“One of the fastest tracks of that happening in Nebraska is not doing what the people voted for or cutting this way too short or restricting it too much, or not passing something at all,” Hansen said.
Hansen said that if that did happen, he wouldn’t be surprised if come November 2026, voters are left weighing whether to approve recreational marijuana. The Blair senator has described the path ahead, with no law change, where the commission could continue to have no funds and no way to do its job, as the “Wild West.”

Some estimates have pegged the damages and economic losses from the fires at more than $250 billion. “We’ve had disaster after disaster after disaster,” said Assemblymember Dawn Addis, a Democrat.

(Mario Tama | Getty Images)For many California residents, the Los Angeles wildfires earlier this year were the latest and most searing example of the devastating effects of climate change. Some estimates have pegged the damages and economic losses from the fires at more than $250 billion.
“We’ve had disaster after disaster after disaster,” said Assemblymember Dawn Addis, a Democrat. “It’s the taxpayers and the insurance ratepayers that are bearing the cost. It’s not sustainable, it’s not right and it’s not ethical.”
Addis and Democratic lawmakers in nearly a dozen other states want to force the world’s largest fossil fuel companies to help pay for the recovery costs of climate-related disasters. Last year, Vermont became the first state to pass a “climate Superfund” law, followed soon after by New York.
This session, 10 states have seen similar proposals, several of which have advanced in key committees. Advocates point to legislation in Maryland that has drawn support in both chambers, as well as to strong grassroots support in California after the Los Angeles wildfires.
Lawmakers say the rapidly increasing cost of climate disasters — from wildfires to floods to sea level rise — is more than state budgets can bear.
“Climate Superfund is the ‘it girl’ policy of the [2025] session,” said Ava Gallo, climate and energy program manager with the National Caucus of Environmental Legislators, a forum for state lawmakers. “There’s a lot of popularity in the idea of holding polluters responsible.”
The momentum for these “polluter pays” bills is tied to the maturation of attribution science. That new field of research can help calculate fossil fuel companies’ contributions to historic emissions totals, as well as the role climate change played in causing or worsening natural disasters.
Vermont’s law was the first attempt to use that science to charge emitters for their role in causing devastating floods and other catastrophes.











We've had disaster after disaster after disaster. It's the taxpayers and the insurance ratepayers that are bearing the cost. It's not sustainable, it's not right and it’s not ethical.


– California Democratic Assemblymember Dawn Addis



Fossil fuel companies and their allies have fought back hard. Late last year, the American Petroleum Institute and the U.S. Chamber of Commerce filed a lawsuit challenging Vermont’s measure. The groups argue that emissions are governed by the federal Clean Air Act, precluding states from charging companies over global pollution.
Neither group responded to a Stateline interview request. The Independent Petroleum Association of America also declined an interview request.
A separate lawsuit, led by 22 Republican attorneys general, is challenging the New York law. And a conservative group has targeted Rachel Rothschild, an assistant professor of law at the University of Michigan Law School, who helped draft the legal justification for climate Superfund policy. The group, Government Accountability and Oversight, has sought to subject Rothschild to a deposition, The New York Times reported, a move that some experts view as an intimidation tactic.
Meanwhile, oil and gas executives asked President Donald Trump during a White House meeting this month to direct the Justice Department to join the legal fight against climate Superfund laws, The Wall Street Journal reported. Industry leaders are also pushing Congress to shield them from more than 30 lawsuits brought by state and local governments that aim to make them pay for some of the results of climate change.
While experts expect a bruising legal battle over climate Superfund policies, the threat of lawsuits hasn’t deterred more lawmakers from backing the concept.
“States were a little bit wary; they wondered, ‘Is this some new radical plan?’” said Cassidy DiPaola, communications director with the Make Polluters Pay campaign, a coalition of groups backing such bills. “Then one of the littlest states passed it and this powerhouse, New York, passed it. That really set the ball rolling.”
Fossil fuel companies have cast doubt on attribution science. They also note that their production of oil and other products was done legally under U.S. and international regulations.
“Manufacturers will see this as a shakedown of any industry you don’t like at some point in the future, even though in the past they were licensed and operated under government regulation,” Brett Vassey, president and CEO of the Virginia Manufacturers Association, said during legislative testimony about a climate Superfund proposal in that state. “It will have a chilling effect on Virginia being able to grow its economy.”
Proponents of Superfund legislation point to legal settlements with large tobacco companies in the 1990s. Although those companies also sold their products legally, they were held responsible because they knew about the harmful effects of those products and deceived the public. Most climate Superfund proposals target companies for their emissions over the past 30 or so years, after leading experts had documented the dangers of greenhouse gases.
“There’s good documentation of how well the fossil fuel industry knew the probable long-term impacts of their product,” said Oregon state Sen. Jeff Golden, a Democrat. “Should an industry that made such historic profits over a period of time and made so many representations that we had no problem not bear any of the costs?”
Golden and other lawmakers say it’s becoming impossible for taxpayers to cover the costs of recovery from wildfires and other catastrophes. In Rhode Island, sea level rise is causing massive damage for coastal communities, said Democratic state Rep. Jennifer Boylan, who has sponsored a climate Superfund bill to help the state adapt.
Some advocates also note that Trump’s return to the White House has cut off the possibility of federal climate relief.
“All the states are affected by the disappearance of this federal funding,” said Gallo, of the state lawmakers group. “States everywhere are going to be looking at some way to fill the gap.”
This session, climate Superfund bills have been introduced in California, Connecticut, Hawaii, Maryland, Massachusetts, New Jersey, Oregon, Rhode Island, Tennessee and Virginia.
While the bills are structured differently, they all seek to target the largest polluters — often covering companies that produced 1 billion metric tons of emissions over the last 30 or so years. Lawmakers say that applies to roughly 100 companies.
The measures also take different approaches to assigning damages. Some direct state agencies to conduct complex studies to determine the costs of climate-caused disasters over a certain period, the approach pioneered by Vermont. Others set a fixed number that represents a conservative baseline for those damages. New York’s law set that figure at $75 billion over a 25-year period.
Many of the bills also require that significant amounts of the funding be directed to the communities hit hardest by pollution.
Advocates are particularly optimistic about the measures in California and Maryland.
Lawmakers in Maryland modified their bills to commission a study about the financial impacts of climate change. Those measures passed both the House and Senate, and legislators are working to reconcile the versions from each chamber. Figures produced by the study would be the backbone of a climate Superfund policy in a future session.
“From a legislative perspective, it’s a shot in the dark as to what the costs are,” said Democratic Del. David Fraser-Hidalgo, who sponsored one of the bills. “This will give us the factual data needed to make a more well-educated decision on policy.”
In New Jersey, an Assembly committee advanced a climate Superfund bill this month. State Sen. Bob Smith, a Democrat who chairs the Environment and Energy Committee and who sponsored the bill, said it will help to rebuild and fortify water treatment plants, schools and firehouses. He noted that Trump has called for the dismantling of the Federal Emergency Management Agency.
“The end of the world is coming; it’s kind of hard to ignore,” Smith said. “FEMA has been the backstop to help communities recover from disasters. If the handwriting isn’t on the wall to all the states that they’ve got to deal with this, shame on them.”
Lawmakers in many states have heard from mayors and other local government leaders that more climate recovery funding is essential.
“Municipal officials are getting behind [climate Superfund policies],” said Massachusetts state Sen. Jamie Eldridge, a Democrat who has sponsored similar legislation. “They’re facing the costs of flooding, of droughts, of heat waves, and really asking for relief.”

(Peter Cade/Getty Images)Two days after a federal judge permanently blocked Arkansas’ Social Media Safety Act, state lawmakers filed two bills Wednesday aimed at expanding social media protections for children.
Senate Bill 611 would amend Act 689 of 2023 (the Social Media Safety Act), apparently to address some of the judge’s reasons for ruling as he did. Act 689 was the first of its kind in the nation and was a priority of Gov. Sarah Huckabee Sanders in her first year in office. It required social media platforms to verify the age of new account holders in Arkansas. Those under 18 could only access sites with parental permission.
Senate Bill 612 would create a right for parents to sue social media platforms if their child develops eating disorders, self-harms, commits or tries to commit suicide, or becomes addicted to the platform’s feeds because of content the child was exposed to. 
Both bills establish a civil penalty of $10,000 per violation.

Sen. Tyler Dees, R-Siloam Springs, and Rep. Jon Eubanks, R-Paris, are chief sponsors of both bills. 
In January, Sanders called on the Legislature to amend the Social Media Safety Act so it wouldn’t be held up in court any longer. U.S. District Judge Timothy Brooks of the Western District of Arkansas had temporarily blocked it in August 2023, shortly before it was to take effect. Brooks on Monday ruled that law violated the First Amendment and the due process clause of the U.S. Constitution.
Sanders also asked lawmakers in January to create a right for parents to sue social media platforms if their children kill themselves because of content encouraging them to self-harm. The governor noted the presence of a woman in the gallery whose child died by suicide.
 In a press release Wednesday announcing the filing of SB 611 and 612, Sanders noted that Arkansas “has led the nation on commonsense, conservative reforms to protect kids online, and these additional protections continue that effort.”
“Moms and dads whose kids have fallen victim to Big Tech deserve the right to take action against these abusive companies – and Arkansas law should protect kids so they aren’t subjected to toxic material in the first place.”
Eubanks and Dees echoed Sanders’ comments.
“This legislation keeps our children safe online, and puts their safety where it should be — in the hands of parents,” Eubanks said in the press release.  
SB 612 “establishes a private right of action for parents whose child commits suicide or attempts suicide because of his or her exposure to toxic material on social media, allowing them to sue abusive Big Tech companies in state court,” Sanders’ press release says.
The amendments to Act 689 in SB 611 more clearly define social media and apply the definition to more platforms, lower the age of minor users to 16, prohibit social media algorithms from targeting minors, and add a penalty for companies that do not comply, according to the press release.
The regulations would apply only to new accounts, it said.
This new legislation follows Sanders’ signing of the Bell to Bell, No Cell Act in February that bans personal electronic devices, including cell phones and smart watches, in schools. That bill was also sponsored by Dees and Eubanks.

The move to table the controversial measure Wednesday in the Senate State and Local Government Committee came at the request of its chairman.  
Sen. Richard Briggs, a Knoxville Republican, cited his neighbor from Canada, an engineer who is at risk of being unable to renew her visa before it expires due to bureaucratic delays resulting from actions taken by the Department of Government Efficiency. Briggs said he was concerned the law could sweep up immigrants like her.
Bill giving immigrants without legal status 72 hours to leave Tennessee advances in House

The bill’s sponsor, Republican Sen. Jack Johnson of Franklin, acknowledged the measure runs afoul of established law and a 2012 Supreme Court decision that said states cannot usurp the federal government’s exclusive power to enact immigration enforcement laws. Rep. Lee Reeves, a Franklin Republican, cosponsored the bill, but noted the bill would take effect only in certain circumstances.
The bill was crafted as a “trigger” law, only going into effect if one of three things happened: the Supreme Court overturned its 2012 decision, the U.S. Constitution is amended or similar laws enacted by other states remain in effect for 60 days.
Sponsors of the bill said it was intended to “demagnetize” Tennessee as a destination for immigrants who lack legal status and immigrant advocates called it “incredibly inhumane” legislation that put families living in Tennessee at risk.

(Photo: John Partipilo)I was a decent Math student until around the ninth grade. I could add, subtract, multiply, and divide quickly and efficiently in my head. Most of that talent was due to scouring baseball box scores in my local paper every afternoon. 
Basic mental math was fairly simple for me, but algebra was  different. There’s some nuance to Algebra – a necessary depth of thought required to arrive at a final answer. 
I hadn’t thought much about math until a recent bill sponsored by Rep. Chris Todd and Sen. Brent Taylor passed a House Subcommittee despite legitimate concerns from faith-based organizations and nonprofits.
The bill would create a Class A misdemeanor to “harbor or hide” someone unlawfully present in the U.S., with a $1,000 penalty and up to a year in jail for each individual who was concealed, harbored or shielded — one would even be liable for knowing a person was in the country without legal status.  A “human smuggling” offense was also tacked onto an already established law of human trafficking. At first glance, it was another example of Todd’s basic political math formula: add one more piece of legislation to an existing law to solve a “problem.” 
Three years ago, Todd, a Jackson Republican, sponsored legislation to “create an offense for a person who engages in an adult cabaret performance on public property or in a location where the adult cabaret performance could be viewed by a person who is not an adult.” 
Tennessee bill to criminalize ‘harboring or hiding” immigrants without legal status advances

Tennessee already had laws pertaining to public decency, including indecent exposure, disorderly conduct, public lewdness and even urinating in public. Todd’s bill targeted the LGBTQ+ community, adding another measure  to constrict an already marginalized group. 
Basic political math: add more laws directly affecting groups of people you disagree with and hope it forces them back into the shadows.
After a mass shooting at Nashville’s Covenant School two years ago, Gov. Bill Lee called a special legislative session  to ostensibly create a few safeguards for responsible gun ownership. Todd, however, sponsored a measure  allowing certain school employees to openly carry firearms in schools or at school events.
 Basic political math: more good guys with guns will solve the problem of bad guys with guns. 
For a long time, I’ve chalked these bills up to Todd simply not being nuanced or creative enough to understand the impact his legislation would have, but I was terribly wrong. He knows exactly what he’s doing and does it well. 
On the surface, there are many parts of current laws and pending GOP legislation that everyone — Republican, Democrat, or Independent—should support. 
No one should want children unprotected in a school, posing as easy targets for a person with a firearm. No one should want children exposed to salacious acts of inappropriate sexuality in public spaces. No one should believe it’s okay for a person to commit violent crimes — U.S. citizen or non-citizen. No one should want immigrants “smuggled” or taken advantage of by an industry or company seeking cheap labor. No one should want adults or children trafficked or prostituted. 
But that’s why the “basic math” approach of legislation is so insidious: it takes problematic issues that every Tennessean hopes to avoid and presents faux solutions by advancing a fundamentally conservative agenda while hurting a vulnerable population of people in our state by capitalizing on exaggerated or even blatantly false narratives. 
The most recent piece of legislation by Todd and Taylor, a Memphis Republican, is easy to support at first glance.but the addendum that is most concerning is the one threatening a misdemeanor charge for aiding immigrants without permanent legal status. 
This is where the approach of basic math runs its course, and some much-needed algebraic nuance is required. 
Immigration is a complex subject with more gray areas than black and white. When there are more questions than answers, addendums like the one above to a mostly reasonable, if not redundant, bill create valid worry and concern based on the rhetoric of President Donald Trump  and any lawmaker who openly supports him. 
I teach at a school with many new students who don’t speak much English. I attend a church that supports a non-profit that helps undocumented immigrants find pathways to full citizenship. If I were to find out one of my students or their families were not citizens, would I be subjected to a one thousand dollar fine? More importantly, what would happen to migrants who are not full citizens but on a pathway to citizenship? Is the intent of this bill to truly protect the vulnerable population of immigrants in Tennessee or another way to further a malevolent movement to remove children and families from our state and country?
Based on recent voting patterns by our supermajority, I already know the answer to that question. It’s as easy as one plus one.

Kennedy Jr. appeared on stage together in Martinsburg wearing matching green hats that read “Make America Healthy Again.” Morrisey was present to show support for the Trump administration’s “MAHA” plan, and RFK Jr. responded by publicly shaming him over his weight — mocking his appearance, offering to put him on a diet and even mentioning a specific amount of weight he needed to lose.
This is not an unfamiliar dynamic in West Virginia politics. Jim Justice’s weight has long been an easy talking point, a cheap insult and topic of fatphobic political cartoons for people across the political spectrum. West Virginia itself is often called one of the nation’s “fattest states” due to high obesity rates, while also experiencing some of the worst health outcomes.
But what does this mean when the scientific relationship between fatness and health is more complicated than it initially seems? According to the Association for Size Diversity and Health (ASDH), “Efforts to make fat people thin fail over and over. And in fact we have decades of research on diets and “lifestyle changes” that show that, while people can intentionally lose weight for six months to one year, they eventually regain most, all, or even more than they initially lost.”
The impact of weight on health gets even more convoluted when the health impacts of fatphobia are included. In their paper “Whatever I said didn’t register with her”: medical fatphobia and interactional and relational disconnect in healthcare encounters”, researchers Carolin Kost, Kimberly Jamie, and Elizabeth Mohr found that fat people “frequently experience negative and highly stigmatizing health care encounters,” which can “compound and worsen disordered eating, trigger mental health problems, and lead to health care avoidance.” Fatphobia itself can actually be one of the causes of worse health outcomes.
Much has been (rightfully) made of RFK Jr.’s talk of wellness camps and banning SSRIs. But his views on “obesity” are dangerous as well: in his confirmation hearing, RFK Jr. calls it an “existential threat” to America. The very same politicians who decry obesity are the same ones who tout things like raw milk and ivermectin.
It can be tempting to look at two tenuously linked factors like weight and health and focus on “solving” one to address the other. But why not start with the things proven to improve health: clean air and water, well-priced food and fair wages, accessible and affordable medical care, stable housing, free child care and paid time off for all, etc? These calls to eradicate a certain size and shape of person should be concerning to us all. The desire to control people’s bodies — by taking away the right to abortion, by criminalizing unhoused people and people who use drugs, by attempting to ban trans health care, and by attempting to eradicate fat people — all come from the same authoritarian project.
Finally, when you use fatphobic rhetoric to insult politicians, even harmful ones, they are usually not the ones hearing it — your fat friends, family members and community members are. It shows that fat bodies are acceptable sites for mockery and derision, just like the rest of the marginalized people Trump and his appointees are targeting. Together, we can demand more to improve our state’s health — and there are much more creative insults out there anyway.

The study, conducted by Urban Institute researchers with support from the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation, calculated that up to 39% of the 13.3 million adults in that age group who became eligible for Medicaid when their states expanded the program under the Affordable Care Act would lose coverage if Congress required states to impose work rules.
The report suggests that most of those people would lose coverage not because they aren’t complying with the rules, but because they would struggle to report their compliance to the state.
“Most adults who would lose eligibility for federal Medicaid funding are working, engaged in work-related activities, or could qualify for exemptions not readily identifiable through state databases but could still face disenrollment because of the reporting requirements,” it states. The study identified several barriers to reporting, including lack of broadband access and lack of transportation.
GOP changes to Medicaid in doubt after Democrat Beshear says legislature failed to fund them

Forty states plus the District of Columbia have expanded Medicaid under the ACA. Overall, nearly 72 million people, about a fifth of Americans, are enrolled in the program for low-income people, which is funded jointly by the federal government and the states.
Traditional Medicaid insurance was mainly available to children and their caregivers, people with disabilities and pregnant women. But the ACA, commonly known as Obamacare, allowed states to extend coverage to adults making up to 138% of the federal poverty level — about $21,000 a year for a single person.
Nationwide, more than 21 million people with low incomes have health insurance because of expanded Medicaid eligibility.
U.S. House Republicans in February pushed through a budget plan, now under consideration in the Senate, that would require about $880 billion in cuts to Medicaid over the next decade to help cover the cost of $4.5 trillion in tax cuts. The budget doesn’t contain specifics on how that target would be met. But work requirements are a likely money-saving option: A 2023 analysis from the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office found that imposing work rules on Medicaid recipients ages 19 to 55 who are not parents or caregivers would cut federal spending by an estimated $109 billion over the next 10 years.
The Congressional Budget Office based that projection on a plan the GOP-controlled U.S. House approved in 2023. That bill, the likely blueprint for the work requirements Republicans are considering now, would have required adults ages 19-55 to work, participate in a job training program or perform community service for at least 80 hours per month for three or more months in a calendar year. Parents and caretakers of dependent children, and those unable to work because of a health condition, would have been exempt.
Many Republican-led states are eager to impose work requirements on able-bodied Medicaid recipients. Thirteen states received permission to impose work rules on at least some Medicaid enrollees during the first Trump administration. Nine additional states requested permission to enact Medicaid work requirements during Trump’s earlier term but had not won approval by the time it ended.
When the Biden administration came into office, it rescinded all the approvals.
Supporters say requiring Medicaid recipients to work, study or train for a career gives them a boost toward self-sufficiency and financial stability. Critics, however, say such rules end up hurting far more people than they help.
The researchers from the Urban Institute mostly based their analysis on the experience of Arkansas, which in June 2018 became the first state to require some Medicaid recipients to work, volunteer, go to school or participate in job training to receive benefits. By the time a federal judge halted the policy in April 2019, 18,000 adults had lost coverage.
The researchers also looked at New Hampshire, which began implementing a work requirement but halted the program in July 2019 before suspending anyone’s coverage.
“What was found in a lot of qualitative research on the previous work requirement programs is that a lot of people were unaware of the policy, or they didn’t understand the policy,” said Michael Karpman, an Urban Institute researcher who co-authored the study.
“People who need coverage the most would do the most to try to maintain it. On the other hand, those people could also face the most difficulty with the administrative barriers,” Karpman said.
In a 2020 study examining how Arkansas’ last experience with work requirements played out, researchers from the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health “found no evidence that the policy succeeded in its stated goal of promoting work and instead found substantial evidence of harm to health care coverage and access.”
Arkansas Republican Gov. Sarah Huckabee Sanders announced in January that she would ask the federal government for permission to institute work requirements, regardless of what Congress decides. The state submitted the request last week.




Especially for a rural state like Arkansas, work requirements fail to take into account a lot of the realities that people may face.


– Christin Harper, policy director for Arkansas Advocates for Children and Families




Arkansas Republican state Rep. Aaron Pilkington, who serves on the health committee in his chamber, said lawmakers “learned our lesson from the last go-round.”
Pilkington said that under the new proposal, the state will only pause coverage instead of canceling it, giving recipients an opportunity to prove they are complying. And, he said, the online portal for reporting will be a lot more user-friendly.
“I think it’s a reasonable thing to ask for able-bodied people to look for work, or try to obtain work,” Pilkington said.
But Christin Harper, policy director for Arkansas Advocates for Children and Families, said even the new version would be a challenge for many enrollees. Many people on Medicaid are juggling multiple jobs, and having to report to the state every month would be a significant burden.
“Especially for a rural state like Arkansas, work requirements fail to take into account a lot of the realities that people may face,” Harper said. She added that “with the overall job market, job opportunities may or may not be available in some of these rural towns.”

Stacy Brenner (D-Cumberland), lead sponsor on the bill [&#8230;]","The proposed route of the Gorham Connector project that sought to expand suburban access to I-95. (Image via Maine Turnpike Authority)Lawmakers from southern Maine have banned together on legislation to scrap the controversial Gorham Connector project that sought to expand suburban access to I-95.
While she knows the region needs a solution for traffic congestion driven by population growth, “the connector is not the solution,” said Sen. Stacy Brenner (D-Cumberland), lead sponsor on the bill that is set to have a public hearing before the Transportation Committee Thursday afternoon. 
In 2017, the Maine Legislature passed legislation that allowed the Turnpike Authority to review traffic conditions west of Portland in Gorham, Scarborough, South Portland and Westbrook and build a five-mile connector to mitigate backups. Then-Gov. Paul LePage vetoed the bill because it was a toll access road, but lawmakers overwhelmingly voted to override his objection.
When that law was passed, traffic projections were much higher than what is seen today, Brenner said. Traffic modeling assumes steady growth, she explained, but the reality depends on shifts in commuting patterns, land use and transportation choices, so it’s important to base infrastructure designs on the most up-to-date data. 
Brenner said she heard concerns from residents and key municipalities “loudly” on the campaign trail last summer. 
Opponents have said it is too large of a fix for a problem that only occurs at limited times in certain areas, according to reporting from the Portland Press Herald. And Brenner also pointed out that any route for the connector would cut through Smiling Hill Farm in Westbrook, a family-owned dairy farm and valued part of the community. Preserving local businesses and working landscapes is important when planning for future transportation needs, she said.
The Gorham Connector would have linked the Maine Turnpike at Exit 45 to the Gorham Bypass off Route 114. The intention was to improve the connection to the Turnpike and I-295 while reducing the commuter traffic on neighborhood roads. 
With an estimated cost of at least $330 million, Brenner said there should be careful consideration of the investment, especially when studies from the Turnpike Authority show a new highway would only reduce commute times by an average of four minutes. 
“Repealing the law allows for a fresh approach to transportation planning, ensuring that any future proposals align with community needs and priorities,” she said. 
“Hundreds of constituents have contributed their time and voices into opposing this project and have asked for this bill to be brought forward.”
LD 1020 would create that blank slate by repealing the 2017 law. It would also require the Turnpike Authority to resell any land purchased for the project back to the previous owner.
If the previous owner doesn’t want the property back, the bill stipulates that it would then be given to the municipality at no cost. If the municipality doesn’t want the land, it would need to donate it to a local land trust. If they also don’t want the land, then it can be offered for sale at a public auction.
Other Democrats from that corner of the state have signed on to the bill, including Sen. Anne Carney of Cumberland County, and Reps. Drew Gattine of Westbrook, Kelly Murphy and Sophie Warren of Scarborough, as well as Eleanor Sato and Parnell Terry of Gorham. Rep. Laurie Osher (D-Orono) is also a cosponsor. 
Transportation officials agreed in early March to consider alternative plans for addressing traffic west of Portland. The Turnpike Authority asked the Maine Department of Transportation to do a two-year comprehensive review of the benefits and limitations of changing the existing infrastructure, as well as gather input from people affected by the traffic in that area. 
Although the landscape has evolved due to factors such as changes in post-pandemic commuting and the state’s housing crisis, the Turnpike Authority said there could still be a need for an “innovative transportation solution” for that area.
Rather than expanding highways, Brenner said there should be an effort to strengthen existing urban areas, improve mobility options and support local economies. 
“Thoughtful, data-driven planning will help ensure the best outcomes for the region’s future,” she said.

(File photo by Bruce DePuyt/Maryland Matters)A committee hearing on a bill to limit the state’s financial liabilities in sex abuse lawsuits ended in an emotional vote Wednesday with one member walking out in anger and another casting a vote in tears.
Lawmakers are scrambling in the final days of the session to pass legislation that could tame potentially crushing payouts to thousands of people who allege they were sexually assaulted as children in state facilities.
“I think this is perhaps a responsible way of dealing with it … it is a reasonable compromise,” said Del. Jon Cardin (D-Baltimore County).
The bill was voted out of the House Judiciary Committee along mostly party lines, and could be before the full House possibly as soon as Thursday. The Senate has yet to take up the bill. Just five days remain in the 2025 session.
Currently, sexual abuse lawsuits filed under the Child Victims Act of 2023 are capped at $890,000 for claims against government agencies and $1.5 million for claims against private institutions. The bill approved in committee Wednesday would lower the maximum payouts for cases filed after May 31 to $400,000 against governments and $700,000 against private institutions.
Additionally, the bill says one payout would cover all abuse incidents involving the same claimant and abuser. The 2023 law leaves open the potential that a court or jury would apply the maximum compensation amount to each instance of abuse.
The changes also cap fees for attorneys at 20% for cases that settle out of court and 25% for cases that result from a court judgment.
The bill wold alter 2023 Child Victims Act, which eliminated restrictions on when a survivor could file a lawsuit, opening the door to claims for abuse that happened decades ago.
At the time that law passed, most of the focus was on institutional abuse allegations connected to the Catholic Church. But the law also lifted restrictions on suing government agencies. Thousands of claims have since been made against Maryland state government.
Those claims raised concerns about the potential for billions in payouts — an amount some, including Del. C.T. Wilson (D-Charles), who sponsored the 2023 law, feared could bankrupt a state already facing a budget crisis.
Del. Robin L. Grammer (R-Baltimore County) said he believed the state shouldn’t be allowed to evade its responsibility to compensate those abused while in state custody, but added he is skeptical of the reported high dollar costs of such cases.
“So the governor’s slogan is leave nobody behind, and I think today, we’re leaving victims behind. We were told the solution to this problem is to pass the legislation,” Grammer said. “Now, when we’re surprised by the liability of the state, we’re told it’s to minimize the liability, and it’s not about the money.”
Del. Lauren Arikan (R-Harford) called the bill offensive to victims. She  later walked out of the committee meeting before casting her vote.
During a floor speech Wednesday evening, Arikan counted herself among those who have been abused. In an exchange with a reporter, she said she had been “molested as a young child,” and said that experience was part of what ultimately caused her to walk out of the Judiciary Committee earlier in the day.
Arikan’s staetment came during floor debate on a bill to create a state reparations commission to study inequities faced by African descendants in Maryland. Arikan had offered an amendment, which ultimately failed,  to create a panel to look at appropriate compensation for survivors of sexual abuse while in state custody.
Arikan said that while Wilson — who has said he, too, suffered physical and sexual abuse as a child — has repeatedly said his efforts with the 2023 law were never about financial compensation for survivors,  “I think it’s offensive to think that one victim speaks for all victims.”
A number of Democrats who voted for the bill in committee said it was a tough decision, but expressed concerns about the potential costs to the state.
Del. David Moon (D-Montgomery County) said the state “does not have the option of bankruptcy to run from our obligations the way our private counterparts do.” Moon voted to move the bill out of committee “with great regret … and apologies to the victims.”
For some, it was an emotional vote.
“I’m a ‘yes’ because I know we have to do something,” said Del. Nicole Williams (D-Prince George’s), who began sobbing as she attempted to explain her decision to support the bill. During her explanation, and after, members of the committee attempted to console her.
Despite the lowered caps for private institutions that was included in the bill, it did not garner support from the Maryland Catholic Conference. In a statement, it criticized the bill for being rammed through in the late days of the session “with little time for careful debate or necessary revisions.”
The conference — the public policy arm of the archdioceses of Baltimore, Washington and Wilmington — noted that the state is making the change after thousands of claims were made against the state under the law.
“In fact, the Maryland state government now appears to be the largest employer of child sex abusers in the state,” the Catholic Conference statement said.",https://marylandmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/House-of-Delegates-wide-shot-newsletter-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-04-03 06:02:00.583218

Areas of North Carolina surrounding a proposed pipeline project would suffer from further environmental pollution, according to a report released this week by the Sierra Club.
The Southeast Supply Enhancement Project (SSEP) to the Williams Company’s Transco Pipeline system is a pipeline running from Virginia to Alabama that would move up to 1.5 billion cubic feet of methane gas each day.
It’s an expansion of an existing pipeline that runs from the Gulf Coast to New York, transporting about a third of the gas used in the country.
SSEP is the largest new pipeline project on the East Coast since the Mountain Valley Pipeline and the Atlantic Coast Pipeline, both of which were started in 2014.
Williams proposed SSEP to provide more energy reliability in the region. The pipeline would add the enough natural gas to serve approximately 9.8 million homes, according to Williams’ website.
The project would have detrimental effects on North Carolina, especially for low-income residents and communities of color, which would be disproportionately affected, environmental leaders said at a press conference on Wednesday.
“We are already overburdened by industrial pollution,” said Crystal Cavalier-Keck, director and co-founder of 7 Directions of Service, an indigenous-led collective focusing on environmental justice. “These communities are treated as sacrifice zones for fossil fuel expansion with little to no say in the decision-making process.”
Cavalier-Keck, a citizen of the Occaneechi Band of the Saponi Nation, said she lives in a frontline community of the kind that are highly exposed to the impacts of environmental hazards and climate change.
Emissions from gas transported by the pipeline would be incompatible with meeting North Carolina’s climate goals, the report found.
SSEP includes a section called the Salem Loop, which would add 24 miles of 42″-wide pipeline in Guilford, Forsyth, and Davidson counties in North Carolina.
Another expansion, known as the Eden Loop, brings about an additional 31 miles of 42″-wide pipeline, primarily in Pittsylvania County, Virginia, but crossing into Rockingham County, North Carolina.
“That’s 55 miles of new pipeline total that would be located largely alongside existing pipeline,” Alison Kirsch, senior energy campaigns analyst for the Sierra Club, said. “Air pollution is already bad in the areas where Transco is proposing to build SSEP, including in low-income- and communities of color.”
North Carolina’s Department of Environmental Quality will need to consider air and water quality permit applications for SSEP. Environmentalists are urging DEQ to factor in the threats that the project poses to the air and water sources of local communities.
The Sierra Club encouraged the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission to conduct a more nuanced environmental justice analysis than Transco did, including considering an environmental impact statement.
Aminah Ghaffar-Fulp, policy director for 7 Directions of Service, emphasized the importance of acknowledging the real communities that will be impacted by the project regardless of any economic or monetary benefits.
“This is a dangerous project is going to cause a lot of harm in communities that already have a bunch of polluters, particularly Black, indigenous and low-income communities, and there’s nothing that can change the negative environmental impact that this is going to have,” she said. “Regardless of how much money it might look like it’s going to bring to the state, it is really just going to line the pockets of certain companies… the overall impact is not worth the sacrifice.”",https://ncnewsline.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Transco-pipeline.png,,,2025-04-03 06:02:00.583218

(Photo by William J. Ford/Maryland Matters)Republicans did not suggest that Gov. Wes Moore (D) had done anything illegal by being the “featured speaker” at a  political action committee fundraiser Wednesday during the legislative session, when fundraising is generally prohibited — but they said it didn’t pass the “smell test.”
That’s why GOP lawmakers in both the House and the Senate tried to introduce emergency bills Wednesday to prohibit such an appearance in no uncertain terms.
“We have laws prohibiting all state lawmakers and the governor from fundraising during the legislative session. These laws were established for one simple reason, and that’s to avoid even the appearance of impropriety,” said Sen. Jason C. Gallion (R-Harford and Cecil), who introduced a bill in the Senate. Del. Nicholaus Kipke (R-Allegany) introduced a companion bill in the House.
“Some political consultants and PAC leaders – they’ll say it’s legal,” he said of Moore’s appearance. “But at least, it does not live up to the spirit of our law. And it definitely does not pass the smell test, especially in the last week of our legislative session.”
  Sen. Jason C. Gallion (R-Harford and Cecil). Photo by Bryan P. Sears).
But with just days left in the session, Democrats said there was not enough time to consider the bills, particularly with more pressing issues like the budget and energy reform still hanging.
“We have a lot of major issues to take on, this would not even apply in the next five days,” said Senate President Bill Ferguson  (D-Baltimore City) in response to a move to fast-track Gallion’s bill.
The bills were a response to Moore’s appearance Wednesday as the featured speaker at a fundraiser held by Unity First PAC, which was created in April 2024, largely to campaign against former Gov. Larry Hogan’s (R) efforts to win a U.S. Senate seat in 2024. Hogan lost to now-Sen. Angela Alsobrooks (D), but the PAC is still doing business.
Maryland laws prohibit legislators, the governor and other state officials from fundraising during the legislative sessions, and while Republican lawmakers feel that would also prohibit Moore’s activities Wednesday evening, the emergency legislation would lay it out explicitly.
Gallion introduced a bill to prohibit legislators or statewide elected officials like the governor from taking part “in a fundraising event as a featured guest or speaker or in another role intended to increase attendance at or the amount of contributions resulting from” the event if it’s held during a legislative session.
Late-filled bills are supposed to go the House or Senate Rules committees, which decide if they are allowed to be assigned to a committee to being the process of jumping through the usual legislative hurdles of committee hearings and floor discussion on the way to becoming law.
With the 2025 General Assembly scheduled to ende at midnight Monday, Gallion hoped to convince senators to bypass the Rules Committee so his bill could go straight to committee hearings.
“The overall issue is something that I know everyone in this room take very seriously,” Gallion said, arguing that the “dark money loophole” needs to be closed “immediately.”
Democratic senators agreed the issue needs to be looked at but said Gallion’s bill was too late to get through the process, and too late to do anything about the Wednesday PAC event.
“Even if we went through the trouble of hearing this bill, it’s too late, the fundraiser is already planned,” Finance Chair Pamela Beidle (D-Anne Arundel) said. “I think this can wait until next year when we aren’t so busy. We’re just swamped with still getting bills out for a vote. I just don’t think we need this interruption that we can’t fix immediately.”
Moore’s PAC launches first attack on Hogan

Majority Leader Stephen S. Hershey (R-Upper Shore) argued the bill is not necessarily focused on the Unity First PAC event but would put a stop to similar events down the line.
“Legal or not, it certainly appears to be unethical,” Hershey said. “This makes sure that we are holding the governor to the same standard that we are — that you’re not fundraising during session. That is something that just doesn’t look appropriate.”
The move to bypass Rules for Gallion’s bill failed 12-34. The House also sent Kipke’s version of the bill to the Rules and Executive Nominations Committee Wednesday.
Kipke was not hopeful Wednesday.
“I don’t anticipate the legislature taking it up because of how short a time we have left,” Kipke said. “I would like to get a hearing, and I will be seeking a hearing from the leaders of the General Assembly. I’ll be talking to them throughout the course of the day. I do think it’s something that has bipartisan support.”
And if that doesn’t work, he plans to push the issue again next year.
“If it doesn’t pass this session, I’ll be introducing it next year,” Kipke said. “The legislature should embrace the blanket prohibition because it’s just the right thing to do.”",https://marylandmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Del.-Nicholaus-R.-Kipke-4-2-2025-1024x590.jpg,,,2025-04-03 06:02:00.583218

John Hickenlooper, seen during a rally at CS Wind in Pueblo on Nov. 29, 2023, has voted in favor of the Trump administration's agenda with unexpected frequency. (Mike Sweeney for Colorado Newsline)Last week, as the U.S. Senate voted to approve President Donald Trump’s pick to head the Food and Drug Administration, Colorado’s junior senator “agonized” over what to do, he told a reporter. He voted “no,” but during a committee hearing he had previously voted in favor of nominee Martin Makary, and he “could have easily gone back and voted yes” during the floor vote, he said.
This episode helps illustrate why Hickenlooper, who is up for reelection next year, is supremely vulnerable to a primary challenge, despite the Democrat’s long record of success in Colorado politics. In the Trump era, when many left-leaning voters in blue states like Colorado are terrified of the federal government and furious about America’s transition to authoritarianism, Hickenlooper has failed to adopt the resistance spirit that the state’s left-leaning residents increasingly demand of officeholders and candidates. 
In fact, he has supported Trump’s agenda more than any other Democratic senator in Washington as measured against home-state presidential vote share.
Primary candidates in the U.S. Senate race in Colorado, no matter their other qualifications, will start their campaigns with a powerful political argument against the incumbent. And that’s just one reason we should expect Hickenlooper to face a robust contest for his seat in 2026.

By the time Makary’s Senate vote arrived, it was clear that the Trump administration was embarked on an aggressive campaign to reshape the federal government as an anti-democratic, anti-constitutional operation that would strip Americans of the services and support they had come to rely on and serve only Trump’s friends and loyal oligarchs. 
Many of their Colorado constituents were looking to Hickenlooper and U.S. Sen. Michael Bennet to “obstruct everything,” since they viewed the entirety of the Trump agenda as so fundamentally destructive.
Within a week, Makary proved the wisdom of the obstruct-everything posture. His very first major act as Trump’s FDA commissioner was to approve the firing of the agency’s respected longtime top vaccine official, fueling fears that Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr.’s Health and Human Services Department is basing national policy on vaccine conspiracy theories.
And on Tuesday, the department began firing thousands of workers, including 2,500 under Makary’s leadership, which critics say will hurt the well-being of Americans.
But Hickenlooper had been voting to confirm odious Trump nominees since the beginning of the administration. They include Secretary of State Marco Rubio (champion of free speech-suppressing arrests of students and politically-based deportation of activists), Energy Secretary Chris Wright (a climate arsonist), and CIA director John Ratcliffe (participant in the infamous national security breach on a Signal chat who then lied to Congress about the contents of the chat). 
Hickenlooper’s votes in the Senate on lower-level appointees, procedural motions and legislation have also contributed to the charge that he is failing to meet the moment.
Even when he’s back home in Colorado talking to constituents, Hickenlooper can appear oblivious to the threats that face the country. During a meeting in Aurora last month with veterans, who complained to Hickenlooper that Trump administration funding cuts and layoffs have adversely affected their health care access, the Democrat talked about his good relationship with Republican senators and suggested that as soon as they heard the vets’ stories they’d be unhappy — as if the adverse effects would be news to them despite widespread coverage of the consequences of such cuts. As if congressional Republicans in the majority had not all but ceded their power to the executive branch under Trump. As if there was any appetite among left-leaning Colorado for Hickenlooper’s collegiality with members of a party that’s effectively a personality cult.
Hickenlooper so far will face two Democratic candidates in 2026, according to Federal Election Commission records. They are Boulder university student Nichole Miner and attorney and professor Karen Breslin, who also challenged Bennet in 2022. There is still time for other Democrats to join the race and establish strong campaigns.
Hickenlooper’s misalignment with the electorate is hardly the only reason for someone to mount a primary challenge. He will be 74 years old by the time of next year’s election, and another six-year term will see him reach 80. President Joe Biden, whose apparent age-related decline forced him out of the presidential race last year only months before the election, undercut his successor’s chance to mount a convincing challenge to Trump and demonstrated in catastrophic fashion the hazards of politicians overextending their service. Many Coloradans would be grateful to Hickenlooper if he simply retired.
There’s also a basic democratic value to consider. No elected official in America — notwithstanding recent MAGA rhetoric, such as about a third term for Trump — is entitled to their office. Every elected official should be challenged at every opportunity, especially at election time, to justify their status as wielders of public power. 
Politicians work for the people, and they are obliged on a routine basis to make an honest case to the people for their fitness as representatives in government.
A primary contest is the best way to get Hickenlooper to answer for his performance.

The five-month extension, which was requested by the Maryland Department of Labor, comes one day after thousands of workers at the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services learned they had been laid off. Many of those worked at HHS offices in Maryland, and are the latest in a wave of federal job cuts by the Trump administration that are hitting Maryland’s economy.
“This contract is designed to provide surge capacity to support Marylanders during this crisis,” Labor Secretary Portia Wu said at Wednesday’s board meeting. “We must be prepared to handle a massive increase in unemployment insurance claims.”
The state is already seeing a rise in unemployment claims, according to Lt. Gov. Aruna Miller (D), who led the board meeting in place of Gov. Wes Moore (D).
HHS workers show up at Maryland offices Tuesday to find they were fired overnight

“Over the past 12 weeks, we’ve seen the reckless and devastating impacts of actions by the Trump administration — with the firings of tens of thousands of dedicated federal public servants, freezing billions of dollars in grants to our research institutions and dismantling the agencies that provide vital services for our state,” Miller said.
“This has impacted Maryland in a real and substantial way,” she said. “We’ve already begun to see an increase in unemployment insurance claims and anticipate that these figures will continue to … increase.”
Wu wants to extend a current call center services contract with the consulting firm, Accenture. The $3.9 million five-month extension would bring the total spent on the Accenture contract to $312.4 million since it was first awarded in April 2020. That first award was worth $19.6 million, state records show.
Maryland Comptroller Brooke Lierman (D) said the contract has “ballooned” since the Hogan administration initially approved funds to pull in call center services in 2020 to help with the anticipated needs due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Since then, the contract has been extended several times.
“This contract was started in COVID,” Lierman said, noting that the Moore Administration was not in office yet, “and it has now ballooned to nearly 1,500% of where it was originally … it’s a little Frankenstein-esque.”
Wu agreed that the contract was costly for the state, which is why she said the department is attempting to wean itself off the Accenture contractors and recruit more state workers to staff the phone lines.
“Our goal is to ramp up the state staff,” Wu said. “We already have 100, we have the authority to bring on another 20,” Wu said. She reported that state workers handled 9,800 this week compared to Accenture’s 6,900 calls.
The contract extension will cover between 50-75 Accenture agents. The state pays about $55 per hour per agent to Accenture, which Wu admitted was an “expensive” and “costly contract” for the state.
State Treasurer Dereck E. Davis had a different interpretation.
“They’re screwing us, let’s not sugarcoat it,” he said, noting that $55 per hour equates to a $110,000 salary, though much of that money goes to the company as overhead and not directly to the worker answering the phone.
But the department still needs the Accenture agents given the rapid-fire layoffs at the federal level, according to Wu.
“We don’t know exactly what is coming our way in the next several months, but we do know that people will have a lot of questions and we want to be there to answer them,” she said.
Between state workers and Accenture agents, the department is handling close to 20,000 calls a week. Many of those calls are looking for “basic information,” such as forgetting a password or understanding how to file a claim. The contracted Accenture workers would answer those basic issues so that state Department of Labor workers would be freed up for more specialized and specific issues.
Despite the numerous questions, Lierman said the board was eager to support the contract extension.
“I wish we didn’t have to support our federal workforce in this way. It’s terrible, but I want us to make sure that we’re supporting our federal workers and that they get this timely information,” she said. “But I also don’t want us to use this federal-government-made disaster to raise taxpayer dollars. I think we understand the fiscal situation in the state, and so we have to make sure that we move on from contracts like this.”",https://marylandmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/DSC_0030-1024x683.jpeg,,,2025-04-03 06:02:00.583218

Jack Bailey (R-Calvert and St. Mary's). (File photo by Bryan P. Sears)By the narrowest of margins Wednesday, the Senate voted to amend the Second Look Act, which gives long-term incarcerated individuals a second chance at life, to make it unavailable to those convicted of killing a first responder.
Eleven Senate Democrats joined all 13 Republicans to pass the amendment 24-23, before giving preliminary approval to the bill. The amendment means that if House Bill 853 wins final approval in the Senate it would have to go back to the House to accept or reject the change, with only five days left in this year’s legislative session.
The amendment by Sen. Jack Bailey (R-Calvert and St. Mary’s) was the only one of three in the Senate that was successful. It said a person convicted of killing a first responder “in the line of duty” would not be eligible to petition the court for a reduced sentence under the Second Look Act. State law defines a first responder as a person such as a law enforcement officer, firefighter, or emergency medical technician.
“This amendment is meant to respect the job of our public safety officers, their families, to protect the victims, to protect the surviving family members, so that they never have to relive this tragedy that they had to go through,” Bailey said in the Senate Wednesday.
Sen. Pamela Beidle (D-Anne Arundel), one of the Democrats who crossed the aisle to support Bailey’s amendment, said after the vote that a main reason she supported the amendment is because her father was a police officer.
Sen. Charles Sydnor III (D-Baltimore County), who sponsored a Senate version of the bill and who served as the floor leader for the House version Wednesday, summarized parts of the legislation by noting a key factor: A judge would determine whether a person can receive a reduced sentence. It’s not a get-out-of-jail-free card, supporters insist.

Under the bill, some people who have served 20 or more years of a prison sentence could petition the court for a sentence reduction. According to the bill approved in the House more than two weeks ago, eligible individuals are those convicted of a crime between the ages of 18 and 25. Besides having to have served at least 20 years in prison, a personcannot have been sentenced without the possibility of parole and cannot be classified as a sex offender to be eligible
The court can assess several factors to determine whether someone incarcerated can have a reduced sentence. Those include the person’s age at the time of offense, if that person completed an educational, vocational, or other programs and “whether the individual has demonstrated maturity, rehabilitation, and fitness to reenter society sufficient to justify a sentence reduction.”
In addition, a victim or a victim’s representative may submit an impact statement to the court about the impact of a crime and proposed sentence reduction.
Prior to the House passing the bill, supporters stressed the fact that a judge will weigh the merits in each case, and that the law would only apply to about 350 people.
Sydnor also mentioned one other word during the nearly 50-minute debate Wednesday: grace.
“We all have grace, and this bill is about grace,” he said. “I would hope that at some point forgiveness would overcome me, and I certainly would not oppose a judge looking at these factors to determine whether or not that individual has made good on the 20 years that they were incarcerated.”
Sen. William G. Folden (R-Frederick) also talked about grace when he introduced an amendment to make those convicted for killing a child under age 13 ineligible for the act.
“I believe in the idea of what my friend from Baltimore County says about grace, but that grace should come extended from those that lost a loved one, not an arbitrary element of adding an additional 18th look back,” said Folden, who added that only the loved ones should be allowed to petition the court.
His amendment was rejected 26-19.
Sen. Paul D. Corderman (R-Washington and Frederick) offered an amendment to make those convicted of killing a probation officer ineligible. Corderman mentioned Davis Martinez, a 33-year-old parole agent killed last year while checking in on a parolee.
“He was killed doing his job, serving our state,” Corderman said.
The Senate rejected his amendment 25-20.
The sponsor of the bill, Del. Cheryl Pasteur (D-Baltimore County), said after the House adjourned Wednesday evening that she was a bit speechless on the amendment from her bill approved by the Senate earlier.
“I’m still trying to process it,” she said.",https://marylandmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/DSC_0418-1024x683.jpeg,,,2025-04-03 06:02:00.583218

(Photo by Christine Condon/Maryland Matters)Some have already started in an acting capacity, some have yet to get the keys to the new office, but they all gathered Wednesday on the second floor of the State House where Gov. Wes Moore (D) made it official, swearing in two new Cabinet-level secretaries and seven office leaders.
The nominees had to be confirmed by the Senate before they could be sworn in. The Cabinet secretaries got the full deal — one hand in the air and one on a Bible, before signing an official book. The others got their own handshake and photo op with the governor.
New Cabinet officials included Commerce Secretary Harry Coker Jr. and Dr. Meena Seshamani, the next secretary of Health who starts Tuesday.
Others included new Maryland Cannabis Administration Director Tabatha Robinson, Maryland Insurance Administrator Marie Grant, Correctional Ombudsman Yvonne Briley-Wilson, Katrina Wiggins as administrator of the Property Tax Assessment Appeals Boards and Shelly Martin as inspector general of Health.
Also sworn in was new Appointments Secretary Mollie Byron, who is taking over from Tisha Edwards, who was Wednesday’s ringleader, one of her last jobs in the office.
During the ceremony, Moore commended his administration’s newest officials for serving the state as it navigates “multiple storms at once.” Those “storms” include “a business model in the state of Maryland that needed updating” and “knowing that the relationship between the federal government and its states has been ruptured,” Moore said.
Moore got a laugh in his opening remarks when he said that Robinson, the new Maryland Cannabis Administration director, would “light up” Maryland.
“No pun intended,” Moore said with a laugh, apologizing to his communications staff. “That wasn’t even in my notes.”
Legislation creating new abortion grants to governor’s desk
Legislation to create new grants to fund abortion services, using untapped funds from insurance surcharges, has now won approval from both chambers and is well on its way to becoming Maryland law.
The Senate approved House Bill 930, sponsored by Del. Lesley Lopez (D-Montgomery), on a largely party-line 31-15 vote Wednesday. It was unchanged from the verion the House passed 98-37 in March, meaning the bill is now off to Gov. Wes Moore’s (D) desk, where he is expected to sign it given his history of support for reproductive rights.
HB930 would give the state Department of Health access to about $25 million in funds that were collected as part of the federal Affordable Care Act, but have not been spent down. The money comes from $1-a-month fee that insurers in the ACA marketplace are required to collect on every policy, to fund abortion services for their policyholders.
Before approving the legislation, Democratic senators shot down an amendment from Minority Whip Justin Ready (R-Frederick and Carroll) to restrict the use of those funds for Maryland residents only — an amendment he previously offered on the Senate version of the bill, which was rejected.
“This has nothing to do with the legality of abortion, the access to abortion for anyone in Maryland,” Ready said. “It just says we’re going to prioritize these Maryland ratepayer dollars for Maryland women.”
Sen. Dawn Gile (D-Anne Arundel), who led floor discussion on the bill, said that the uptick from out-of-state patients seeking abortion in the state was one of the leading reasons to support the legislation and those patients should not be cut out of the bill by Ready’s amendment.
“Our health care infrastructure here is under distress. We have lots of people here from out of state, it’s very important that individuals have access to these funds,” she said. “This is about basic access to health, using funds that are available, that are sitting in these accounts.”
The Senate version, Senate Bill 848, is identical and has already received both House and Senate approval, so it also awaits the Governor’s consideration.",https://marylandmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/DSC02662-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-04-03 06:02:00.583218

Dolesh, who says it's worth fighting for the program and the parks, playgrounds and natural resources it's brought us.","Stock.adobe.com photo by Jim.Program Open Space has done an extraordinary job in conserving Maryland’s most valuable natural lands and providing funding for local recreational facilities, playgrounds and parks. However, in the history of Program Open Space and the land conservation and recreation programs funded under its umbrella, the funds have been diverted several times to fund critical state needs during times of budget crises.
Here’s how to be sure they don’t disappear forever in this budget crisis.
The revenues that fund POS and a host of other conservation and recreation projects are generated by a one-half of 1% transfer tax on the sale of homes. When the program began in 1969, it was thought that the funds would be sufficient to protect 10% of Maryland’s open spaces. Since then, the revenues have exceeded the wildest expectations of the governors, legislative leaders and agency staff who were the architects of the program.

Maryland has now protected 30% of its open space lands and has expanded the Program Open Space to include a host of other valuable preservation programs including the Maryland Agricultural Land Preservation Foundation, the Rural Legacy program, capital maintenance of state park facilities and increased development of recreational facilities at the local level.
But the success of Program Open Space and its related conservation programs has made its funding source a fat target when lean times come around. This is not an unexpected outcome for special funds or state trust funds to be the first place that the executive and legislative branches look for relief when budget crises arise.
In the history of Program Open Space some or all the transfer tax revenues were diverted from 2002-2006 and again from 2009-2016, even in spite of legislation requiring the funds to be reimbursed.
Fast forward to the present day. The state is facing a structural deficit of more than $3 billion, and this does not take into consideration the yet-to-be-determined losses of state and local revenues from Trump administration cuts to budget and personnel. Maryland is particularly at risk because of the high proportion of federal workers who reside and work in the state.
What does this mean for the current budget and the future of land conservation in Maryland? There are a few lessons from history to guide present deliberations.

This isn’t the first time and it won’t be the last time that budget crises will make Program Open Space vulnerable. Yes, it is likely that the governor and legislature will take some or all the POS revenues. There needs to be strong, unified public pressure on the executive and legislative branches to restore the funding by a date-certain, and to renew the call for the restoration of funds each year.


In previous diversions of POS funding, a very vocal and effective coalition formed to focus on tracking the diversions and calling for restoration of funding. The present diversions should be a wake-up call to revitalize this very effective coalition. The strength of the original Partners for Open Space Coalition was in its diversity and unity.


A simple, unified message needs to resonate among advocates to the legislature and governor: Restore the funds! In previous diversions, the POS coalition was successful in gaining a promise to return full funding to Program Open Space


History has shown that annually taking all the POS revenues is a bad idea. In times of past diversions, unique opportunities to protect extremely valuable and important natural resource lands and waters, scenic resources and agricultural lands were lost because the state was unable to act in sufficient time to conserve the resource. The simple message here is: Don’t take all the funds each year.


Homebuyers, rural and urban communities, farmers and landowners will suffer a true loss when these funds are diverted. By taking these funds from their dedicated purpose, Marylanders will have fewer parks, fewer protected lands, less ability to adapt to climate change and sea level rise, and in effect, will pay a tax for a service that is never delivered to them or their communities.

These are lean times that we are entering, and we don’t know how mean they will be or how long they will last. We do know that Program Open Space has immeasurably enriched Maryland. History shows us that we can weather the storm and still sustain the best of what this conservation program has brought us by restoring it to full productivity when the crisis is over.",https://marylandmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/AdobeStock_265887583-1024x683.jpeg,,,2025-04-03 06:02:00.583218

(Photo by Markus Schmidt/Virginia Mercury) In a swift and silent rebuke, the Virginia House of Delegates on Wednesday signed off on just 41 of Gov. Glenn Youngkin’s proposed changes to the $188 billion state budget, rejecting the other 164 without floor debate.
Democrats fail to override Youngkin vetoes in largely symbolic showdown

The move leaves billions in spending and tax policy hanging in the balance — and sets the stage for a potential showdown between Democrats, a GOP governor and a Republican legislative minority three months before the new fiscal year begins. 
At the heart of the disagreement is Youngkin’s effort to slash $300 million from the budget to plug anticipated shortfalls linked to waning federal support. A major casualty of those proposed cuts is the funding to fully lift a long-standing cap on support for school staff — a key priority for public schools across the state. 
Lawmakers had approved $223 million for that initiative in February, but Youngkin wanted to pull back $183.2 million of it. The House said no. 
And although House Democrats supported locking in permanent increases to the standard tax deduction for filers who don’t itemize, along with an expanded refundable earned income tax credit for low-income Virginians, Senate Democrats pushed back, declining to make those changes permanent — despite including two-year boosts to both in the budget passed during the session. The proposal was one of eight additional amendments from Youngkin that failed in the Senate. 
Despite the tensions, the Democratic-controlled legislature did throw the governor a few wins, including a key concession for small businesses. Lawmakers agreed to continue the pass-through entity tax workaround, allowing business owners to bypass federal limits on state and local tax deductions. 
In his budget amendments that he unveiled at an event before administration officials and reporters in Richmond last month, Youngkin had already signed off on the legislature’s plan to issue nearly $1 billion in income tax rebates this fall — right before the upcoming statewide elections — with individuals set to receive $200 and joint-filers $400. He also accepted bonuses for public employees, a 1.5% bump for state workers and $1,000 payouts for teachers and school staff. 
Still, some of Youngkin’s more populist ideas never made it off the drawing board. During the legislative session, Democrats soundly rejected his proposals to offset car tax payments and exempt tip income from taxation, both modeled after GOP efforts on the national stage. 
In a statement released Wednesday evening, Youngkin acknowledged the formal conclusion of the 2025 legislative session with measured appreciation, even as Democrats rejected the vast majority of his proposed budget changes. 
“The General Assembly has now concluded its legislative work for 2025. I am grateful to all our legislators, who dedicate their time and energy to serving the people of Virginia,” Youngkin said.
Despite the pushback against a wide swath of his proposed amendments, the governor struck a conciliatory tone and emphasized the next phase of the process. 
“Over the next 30 days I will review and take final action on the bills and budget amendments that have been sent back to my desk,” he said, signaling that more vetoes could still be on the horizon.
Beginning with lunch in the afternoon, Virginia lawmakers ended Wednesday’s lengthy reconvened session agreeing on several amendments made by Youngkin, moving forward proposals to improve traffic stops in the commonwealth, expand opportunities for people who have been incarcerated and reign in risky drivers.
However, on the same day, lawmakers also rejected Youngkin’s amendments for bills that would have made changes to textbook and instructional materials in public schools, preserved Virginians’ access to contraceptives and required unconscious bias training when renewing medical licenses.
Here are some of the bills taken up during Wednesday’s reconvened session.
 Probation reform advances

Following an unlikely alliance between the two parties, Virginia is now a step closer to probation reform that advocates stress can help citizens returning to their communities after incarceration get back on their feet and be less likely to reoffend. 
After passing both chambers last month, Virginia’s legislature formally accepted the governor’s amendments to SB 936 and HB 2252. Youngkin vetoed a version of the bill last year before embracing it this year, albeit with his own changes tacked on.
Unlikely allies unite for probation reform, but Youngkin has final say

Both bills aim to allow reduced probation times if formerly incarcerated people demonstrate certain milestones indicative of reestablishing their lives. Examples include securing employment for at least 30 hours a week, earning vocational certifications, participating in mental health or substance use treatment programs and obtaining stable housing and health insurance coverage. 
While the passed version of the bill allows for up to 30-days reduction in probation time depending on criteria met and 15 days for others, Youngkin’s amendment places them all at 15 days. Advocates in support of the bill note that it can build on an executive order Youngkin signed last summer designed to reduce recidivism. 
With his amendments accepted, he’s likely to sign the bill. 
 Right-to-contraception amendment nixed 

As happened last year, the legislature passed a right-to-contraception bill that Youngkin sought amendments on before later vetoing. Both chambers rejected the governor’s recommended changes to the measure.
Youngkin’s substitute of the bill reinforces two U.S. Supreme Court cases that deal with access to contraception nationwide, while the proposal would preserve contraception access specifically in Virginia, if those federal cases should be overturned. Some states have debated contraceptive restrictions after the rollback of federal protections for abortion in 2022.
Before requesting the Senate reject his amendments Wednesday, bill sponsor Sen. Ghazala Hashmi, D-Chesterfield, said Youngkin’s amendment “makes this bill not really worth anything at all.” 
When lawmakers rejected his amendment last year he’d vetoed the bill — something that is likely to reoccur this year. 
 Unconscious bias amendments rejected

Also on the reproductive health front, the legislature rejected Youngkin’s amendments to a bill that would require unconscious bias training when renewing medical licenses. Carried several years in a row with bipartisan support and patronage, Youngkin sought similar amendments last year that were rejected before he ultimately vetoed it.
His substitute strips the mention of cultural competency and unconscious bias, and instead added “populations that data indicate experience significantly greater than average maternal mortality, postpartum complications and infant mortality.”
Youngkin signs several maternal health bills, tweaks another on unconscious bias training

The proposal, found in SB 740 and identical House measure HB 1649, was part of a slate of bills aimed at improving maternal health outcomes this year, in light of data showing Black women are more likely to have negative outcomes or die than others. Studies show that racial bias can be a factor in the disparities. 
With his changes not accepted, he could veto the bill again. 
 Establishing a sole Pharmacy Benefit Manager for Virginia

The legislature voted to reject Youngkin’s amendments to SB 875 and HB 2610, which would establish a sole pharmacy benefits manager in Virginia. 
Pharmacy benefits managers act as intermediaries between health plans, drug manufacturers and pharmacies, but their lack of transparency has raised concerns. PBMs retain rebates and discounts from contracts, leaving consumers and pharmacies unsure how much savings are actually being passed on. 
After the proposals cleared the Senate unanimously and nearly so in the House, Youngkin’s amendment sought to study the matter further. 
“We do not need more studies,” Sen. Aaron Rouse, D-Virginia Beach, one of the bill’s patrons, said Wednesday. “This is a true bipartisan bill.” 
He and Republican lawmakers have teamed up to tout what they called the “Save Local Pharmacies Act.” The bill would eliminate health-plan-run PBMs in Medicaid and establish a single state-contracted one. This move, supporters say, would improve accountability, lower costs and help independent pharmacies stay afloat. 
 Exhibition driving bill speeds ahead

The House agreed to the governor’s recommendation targeting exhibition driving that would bring tougher penalties for offenders. 
The bill, carried by Del. David Bulova, D-Fairfax, broadens Virginia’s reckless driving laws to include exhibition driving, defined as aggressive driving near groups of two or more people. Offenders would also face stiffer penalties including up to a year in jail and a $2,500 fine — either or both — under the proposal.
Passengers of exhibition drivers wouldn’t get off scott-free, either. If they’re caught riding on a car’s hood or roof, they would face a $500 fine, the measure dictates.
One of the amendment changes removes the mandatory minimum jail term if an offender causes the death of another person. The penalty for the felony offense is a minimum of one year and a maximum of 20 years in jail.
 Driver-police communication improvements pending

The House accepted a recommendation by the governor for a bill carried by Del. Sam Rasoul, D-Roanoke, that would improve communication between drivers who have been diagnosed with autism spectrum disorder and law enforcement officers. 
HB 2501 charges the Department of Motor Vehicles with designing a program that would oversee the development of special envelopes identifying drivers with autism, which those drivers could show police during traffic stops to help the interaction proceed smoothly. 
The governor’s recommendation added language that the DMV does not have to verify any information on the envelope.
According to the Department of Planning and Budget, it would cost about $14,500 for DMV to implement the proposal.
 Amendment to textbook, instructional materials bill rejected

Lawmakers in both chambers rejected the governor’s amendment for a bill that would have made changes to textbooks and other instructional materials in Virginia’s public schools.
Sen. Schuyler VanValkenburg, D-Henrico, who carried the bill in the Senate, opposed the governor’s amendment because it excluded in part language to create a work group to study the textbook approval processes.
The amendment also excluded language that would require the Virginia Department of Education to consult with teachers, specialists and subject experts to evaluate any changes to the current textbook review process.
The companion bill, carried by Del. Dan Helmer, D-Fairfax, was also rejected in the House.
 License plate reader regulation tweak blocked

An effort to regulate automated license plate readers at the state level was met with debate and near-defeat throughout the 2025 legislative session, after the proposal had also been workshopped last year by the Virginia Crime Commission. After passing the legislature, Youngkin’s amendments to HB 2724 were rejected Wednesday. 
The technology has become widely adopted by law enforcement, private businesses and homeowner associations across the country but has also largely operated in a grey area. Virginia’s police departments that use it have not been subject to regulation — though some departments, such as  Charlottesville’s, have already self-regulated, with moves like capping data storage to seven days.
In attempting to regulate at the state level, House Majority Leader Charniele Herring, D-Alexandria, sought to limit data storage to 30 days, but opposition from criminal justice and immigrants rights groups compelled her to reduce that to 21 days. 
Youngkin’s amendment would have bumped that back up to 30 days. With the rejection, he can now choose to sign the bill as it had come to him or he can veto it.

(Photo by David DeWitt, Ohio Capital Journal.)As Ohio legislators were working to finish the House’s draft of the state operating budget for the next two years, the Ohio Chamber of Commerce held its Childcare Policy Summit across the street with advocates and business leaders stressing the importance of child care to workers and business.
“We can’t just warehouse kids, we can’t just provide custodial child care to kids,” said David Smith, executive director of Horizon Education Centers.
The chamber held the summit for the second time in two years as it leans in to the issue. Its senior vice president of government affairs, Rick Carfagna, said it is “the largest workforce throttle that we have at the moment.”
“We have an entire demographic of Ohioans that are skilled, they are college educated, they are creative, they are hard-working people, men and women alike, and they are simply not looking for work at all,” Carfagna told the Capital Journal.
Before the summit even began, he spoke to lawmakers in the House Children and Human Services Committee, supporting bills to address the cost of child care and the building up of the child care workforce.

House Bill 2 aimed to establish the “Child Care Cred Program,” to split the cost of child care three ways: funding from the state, a share from employers, and the rest from employees who are eligible for the child care.
Another part of the new draft budget is a Child Care Recruitment and Mentorship Grant Program to help “increase the number of licensed child care providers in Ohio and assist recruited entities and individuals,” according to the budget language released this week. It contains a $3.2 million appropriation in fiscal year 2026 for “child care provider recruitment.”

Smith was part of a panel discussion about the “workforce behind the workforce,” child care workers who take care of children so their parents can go to school or maintain their place in the workforce.
Meanwhile, Ohioans have been having trouble staying in the workforce because of the lack of affordable child care and lack of access to any child care at all in some regions of the state.
Advocates in and out of Tuesday’s summit have said raising the eligibility level for Publicly Funded Child Care and reimbursement rates for child care workers should be top of mind for lawmakers if they want to help the situation.
In the Ohio House’s version of the budget, the Publicly Funded Child Care eligibility remained at the current level of 145% of the federal poverty line, rather than the governor’s proposal — and the one child care advocates hoped for — of 200%. In Ohio, the federal poverty level for a family of four is $32,150 a year.
Carfagna said the chamber hoped the federal poverty level would be increased, but “that alone isn’t good enough.”
As a former a lawmaker who’s gone through the budget process, Carfagna said he understands there are numerous priorities being dealt with in the budget, and that legislators have to weigh them.
“There are a lot of big price-tag issues that all just kind of hit you from different corners, so legislators, probably rightfully so, need to be careful to not overpromise,” he said.
One big item that has been widely supported by child advocates all over the state was a proposal by Gov. Mike DeWine in his executive budget to create a refundable income tax credit of up to $1,000 for Ohio children up to age 6. That provision did not make it to the House draft.
The Child Care Voucher Program, a previously existing program that subsidizes some children’s admission into qualified child care centers, did have its eligibility brought to 200% of the federal poverty line in the House budget draft.
According to the budget document, however, the voucher program would have a budget of $50 million for each year of the biennium, rather than the previous proposal of $75 million in fiscal year 2026, and $150 million in 2027.
 Workforce help
In addition to a lack of affordability and access is a problem in which the staffing needed to take care of young children is just not there, advocates said.
Tami Lunan, organizing director for the Ohio-based CEO Project who was not part of the summit but has been testifying in favor of child care measures at the Statehouse as part of the the budget process. She said new money for the child care sector should go directly to providers.
“We want to see something transformational, and I think looking to our workforce is a big part of that,” Lunan said.
Lunan said the industry already has low wages and high turnover, and continuing to underfund the staff maintains the narrative that the workforce is not as important as in other professions.
“I think that’s by design that we’re not investing in it,” Lunan said. “Because we don’t see those businesses as viable, we don’t see those workers as professionals. They look to them more as babysitters.”
According to a 2024 analysis by Policy Matters Ohio, Black Ohioans are more likely to be child care workers, making up 18.8% of the industry’s workforce, despite only making up 12.5% of the state population that year.
The Ohio legislature has heard testimony from several child care workers, advocates, and the Ohio Chamber of Commerce about the need to incentivize work in the child care sector, and improve pay and benefits for those workers.
Traditional business solutions won’t work for child care providers, said Chris Angellatta, CEO of the Ohio Child Care Resource & Referral Association.
“We have challenges that are very different,” Angellatta said. “We can’t just compete in the labor market and continue to pay people more and just expect families to continue to pay more. It’s already expensive.”
To help care providers, the House budget draft has a provision to calculate Publicly Funded Child Care based on a child’s enrollment with a provider, rather than basing it on the child’s attendance. That’s something Angellatta said would be “critical” for both families and providers.
“We all know that just because someone is not in attendance doesn’t mean that spot isn’t saved for them,” he said.
An Early Childhood Education Grant Program to “invest in Ohio’s early learning and development programs” including licensed child care centers, licensed family child care homes, and licensed preschools is included in the House budget draft as well. Eligibility goes up to 200% of the federal poverty line.
Discussions about child care in Ohio come down to one primary theme: It can’t be fixed by one bill or one source of funding. Instead, the state and everyone involved in decision making have to implement multi-step strategies to improve the start of children’s education and the building of a new workforce.
“If you really want to do this, you have to do it in a three-dimensional manner,” Carfagna said. “You have to attack it from the eligibility standpoint, the capacity side of it, and we need people to staff our child care centers.”
For Lunan, the problem can be looked at very simply by those who hold the state’s funding decisions in their hands.
“We literally can not have a thriving economy without child care,” she said.
The House budget will now move to the Ohio Senate, which will draft its own budget. The two drafts will need to be reconciled before the end of June, when a budget must be sent to DeWine for his signature.

As North Carolina’s top lawyer, Attorney General Jeff Jackson has many important jobs — handling important criminal prosecutions, protecting consumers, representing state agencies in litigation. But if there’s a duty that is clearly his Number One priority, it has to be defending North Carolinians from unlawful attacks on their rights and well-being.
And it’s in light of this obvious fact that Jackson should be commended for his recent action challenging the Trump administration’s unlawful scheme to cancel billions of dollars in Health and Human Services grants already allocated by Congress.
In bringing suit along with 21 other attorneys general, Jackson rightfully blasted the move by Trump and his right-hand man Elon Musk to slash more than $230 million in critical health care funding for North Carolina as both unlawful and dangerous.
The bottom line: In standing up for our state, Attorney General Jackson is doing precisely what voters elected him to do. Trump apologists in the legislature who are currently seeking to prevent Jackson from challenging presidential orders, are dead wrong.

Jeremiah Moore (right), R-Clarendon, present House Bill 1150 to the House Committee on Insurance and Commerce on Wednesday, April 2, 2025. (Tess Vrbin/Arkansas Advocate)A House panel Wednesday approved a bill aimed at preventing pharmacy benefit managers (PBMs) from holding a permit to operate a drug store in Arkansas.
Opponents outnumbered supporters in the public comment period of the House Insurance and Commerce Committee meeting, but a majority of the panel’s 21 members voted to send House Bill 1150 to the full House.
PBMs negotiate prescription benefits among drug manufacturers, distributors, pharmacies and health insurance providers, and they rank prescription drugs with the highest-tiered products costing consumers the lowest out-of-pocket costs. The Federal Trade Commission released an interim report in July 2024 saying these conglomerates are eliminating competition and increasing drug prices at the expense of patients.
“Pharmacy benefit managers are gaming the system to line their own pockets with taxpayers’ and patients’ money,” said HB 1150 sponsor Rep. Jeremiah Moore, R-Clarendon.
He decried the “patently false” statements circulating about the potential impact of HB 1150 from those who oppose it, such as the idea that 2.7 million Arkansans would lose access to health care. HB 1150 has faced a marketing campaign against it in the two and a half months since it was filed, and Moore said the opposition has primarily come from PBMs.
Arkansas lawmakers seek to ban prescription drug middlemen from owning pharmacies in the state

Some of Wednesday’s opponents of HB 1150 represented corporate health care organizations, including Russell Harper, a government relations executive with the Navitus Health Solutions PBM.
Harper said the bill “will result in lots of unintended consequences that will bring patient disruption, patient confusion and patient access issues to important drug treatments, not just in the commercial market, but in Medicare, Medicaid and Tricare.”
He claimed a wide swath of Arkansas pharmacies, including 23 within CVS and 26 within Kroger, would be at risk of closing if HB 1150 passes.
John Vinson, CEO of the Arkansas Pharmacists Association, denied the allegation that HB 1150 would force pharmacies to close by taking PBMs out of the competitive pharmacy market.
“It gives pharmacies a choice of whether they want to be a PBM or a pharmacy,” Vinson said. “[They would] pick one or the other.”
 Debate

Several PBMs are affiliated with interstate mail-order pharmacy operations, and House Bill 1150 includes mail-order pharmacy permits among those that PBMs would be prohibited from holding. Vinson said Wednesday that some PBMs force consumers to receive their medications via mail, which costs more than receiving them over the counter.
Mike Castleberry claimed HB 1150 would reduce mail-order pharmacies’ presence in Arkansas to the point that patients would not be able to access necessary medication. Castleberry is chief revenue officer at Consociate Health, which represents “self-funded employers” in Arkansas, and he said many pharmacies can only afford to provide specialty drugs if they use mail-order operations.
“The first phone call that y’all are going to get from your constituents [if HB 1150 passes] is someone who’s on a specialty drug,” he said.
Randy Zook, president of the Arkansas Chamber of Commerce, said lawmakers should not make laws that attack vertical integration in business, but Vinson and Moore both said PBMs’ vertical integration is unique because they set their competitors’ prices.

Federal regulator: Pharmacy middlemen appear to be raising prices, hurting patients


OptumRX, Express Scripts and CVS Caremark — the three largest PBMs — are each owned by much larger corporations that each also own a top-10 health insurer. Together they control about 80% of the U.S. prescription market, according to last year’s Federal Trade Commission report.
CVS Caremark is a subsidiary of CVS Health, and District Leader of Pharmacy Operations Ashley Ellis expressed opposition to HB 1150 on Wednesday. Ellis said pharmacists that work for PBM-owned and corporate pharmacies are still members of their local communities, and they have access to the medications and equipment that serve people with complex health needs while independent pharmacies do not necessarily have these things.
Rep. Richard McGrew, R-Hot Springs, said he received several emails from constituents who ostensibly opposed HB 1150 but said they “knew nothing about this” when he contacted them. He alleged that the emails came from lobbyists against HB 1150 who received his constituents’ personal information from CVS, where they told him they receive prescription drugs.
McGrew questioned Ellis about this “breach of integrity,” and Ellis said she was not aware of this.
 Past legislative action

Navitus Chief Pharmacy Officer Sharon Faust said Arkansas has been “a frontrunner” on regulating prescription drug access and prices, but HB 1150 would be “a step too far, a step further where you’re actually limiting patient choice [and] reducing competition.”
Vinson and Moore said PBMs routinely reimburse their affiliate pharmacies at a higher rate than their competitors, locally-owned independent pharmacies.
This practice is outlawed in Arkansas by Act 1 and Act 3 of 2018, which became law after a special legislative session. Arkansas lawmakers have been attempting to regulate PBMs for the past decade, starting with Act 900 of 2015, which required PBMs to pay pharmacies at least as much as the national average of what drugstores pay wholesalers for drugs.
Pharmacy benefit managers will have to pay Arkansas drugstores dispensing fees under new rule

Despite this, pharmacies sent the Arkansas Insurance Department (AID) roughly 3,000 complaints in 2024, claiming PBMs either illegally paid them below this national average or paid them at or just above this amount, AID’s general counsel told lawmakers last year. Independent pharmacists made similar claims in September, saying they were struggling to stay open in rural areas with limited healthcare resources.
The Arkansas Legislative Council approved a rule in December to require PBMs to include dispensing fees in their reimbursements for prescription drugs.
Removing PBM-affiliated pharmacies from the market would require the employee benefits division of the Arkansas government “to reevaluate and restructure their pharmacy networks and implement new compliance measures,” according to an actuarial statement measuring the fiscal impact of HB 1150.
“There could be minor cost or saving[s] to the plan from excluding certain retail pharmacies from their network, such as CVS Caremark,” according to the statement. “Such a change would require a significant number of EBD members to transfer their prescriptions to an in-network pharmacy and may reduce pharmacy network access.”

(Getty Images)During a busy two days of voting last week, the New Hampshire House of Representatives approved several Republican-backed bills seeking to lift or prevent certain public health-centered requirements for children.
Two of these bills target childhood vaccination requirements. The first, House Bill 357, was passed by the House on March 27 in a 195-174 vote.
The bill would forbid the state’s commissioner of health and human services from choosing which vaccines children in New Hampshire are required to receive. All mandatory vaccines would have to be chosen and enacted by the Legislature under this bill. If it were to pass — and the Legislature doesn’t enact further legislation requiring them — varicella, Hepatitis B, and Haemophilus influenzae type B (Hib) vaccines would stop being mandatory among children in July 2026. Diphtheria, mumps, pertussis, poliomyelitis, rubella, rubeola, and tetanus vaccines would remain mandatory as they are required by state statute, not the commissioner.
The Legislature previously gave the commissioner of the Department of Health and Human Services the authority to choose what vaccines are mandatory for children in addition to the ones already mandatory by state statute. Lori Weaver is the current health commissioner. Children can be exempted from these requirements if a physician certifies that the vaccine would be detrimental to their health or if the parents say it goes against their religion, per state law. That would not change under this bill.
Speaking in favor of the bill on the House floor, Rep. Matt Drew, a Manchester Republican, argued the legislation “is not actually about vaccines.”
“This bill is about the exercise of state power, specifically the power to violate the bodily autonomy of innocent children,” Drew said. “We may choose to do that. This body has the power to do that given a good reason. … But it is not something that should be done lightly.”
He argued the Legislature should not let the Department of Health and Human Services decide when to do that.
“This is our job,” he said. “We should do it publicly and by statute.”
Only one Democrat — Rep. Jonah Wheeler of Peterborough — voted in favor of the bill.
Rep. Lucy Weber, a Walpole Democrat, argued this bill would “remove decision-making from a nonpartisan evidence-based process led by doctors, epidemiologists, infectious disease experts as it has been done for decades and hand it over to the state Legislature to be a political football.”
HB 357 will now be considered by the Senate. The Senate Health and Human Services Committee is expected to hold a hearing on it soon. The full Senate and governor will also need to approve the bill for it to be enacted.
House Bill 679, which was also passed last week, seeks to bar the state and health and human services commissioner from requiring any vaccine for children that has not been shown in clinical trials to prevent transmission of a disease. It was approved through Republican support (Wheeler was again the only Democrat voting in favor) in a 204-165 vote.
Rep. Trinidad Tellez, a Hooksett Democrat, argued that even when a vaccine doesn’t directly prevent transmission, if it prevents someone from getting the illness in the first place, it prevents that person from transmitting it.
“Vaccines are most effective when most of us get vaccinated because collectively that provides herd immunity,” Tellez said. “When most people are vaccinated there is less of that illness in the community, and as a result, there is decreased transmission.”
She said the bill “isn’t based on science and introduces an impossible standard.”
“Vaccines are not created nor tested to prevent transmission,” she continued. “Rather they decrease disease severity and how much we see of it.”
She said the bill will likely eliminate mandates for most vaccines as she believes pharmaceutical companies are unlikely to go back and test for transmission.
Drew, the Manchester Republican, was again in favor of this bill.
“Once again, this bill is not about the safety and effectiveness of vaccines,” Drew said. “This bill is about whether the state should mandate — force — children to get certain vaccines.”
HB 679 is also on its way to the Senate, and the Health and Human Services Committee is set to hold a hearing on it. The bill will need the full Senate and governor’s approval to be enacted.
House Bill 361, which was passed in a 203-164 vote last week, would forbid public schools in the state from requiring students to wear masks in school. The bill does not apply to safety equipment worn in sports or during science lab activities.
The bill comes in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic where many schools instituted mask mandates in an effort to reduce the spread of the virus. Those mandates saw intense backlash from parents who believed this was government overreach, that masks weren’t effective, and that they had adverse effects on kids. However, the issue proved contentious as other parents were concerned about the risk of their child contracting the virus and thus wanted their classmates wearing masks.
Rep. Kristen Noble, a Bedford Republican, argued these masks negatively impacted students’ learning, speech, physical health, emotional well-being, and social development. She also said that students who can’t wear masks because of their disabilities need to be protected from future mask mandates. 
“We cannot let this be a local decision,” Noble said. “A proper risk-benefit analysis for children must be done based on facts and not fear. That is a task that should be left to experts at the state. School boards were in the middle of two very vocal opinions on masking. No matter what the school boards decide, they lose. They should never have that responsibility placed on them again.”
She said the New Hampshire Department of Health and Human Services’ Division of Public Health wrote in a letter recently that “decisions on face masks should be based on individual choice and informed by a person’s own assessment and acceptance of risk from infectious diseases rather than from universal requirements.”
She pointed out that the bill doesn’t stop anyone from wearing a mask, including those who are immunocompromised or who want additional protection due to a family member being sick or immunocompromised.
However, the bill does stop schools from requiring others to wear a mask to protect those people. 
This bill was also passed against the wishes of most House Democrats, who argued the bill doesn’t take into account the changing nature of medical and scientific understanding and takes away the freedom of school districts to respond to health situations in their district. Two hundred of the bill’s 203 votes in favor came from Republicans; two Republicans voted against it.
Rep. Hope Damon, a Croydon Democrat, asked her colleagues ahead of the vote to “please pause for a moment” and “step back from the understandably strong emotions around our shared concerns around pandemic experiences and the impacts of masking during that time.”
She argued school districts should have the flexibility to require masks if extreme circumstances occur in their local community.
“Imagine that you are an 8-year-old second-grade student, Lydia,” Damon said. “You’ve had surgery to remove a brain tumor and are now undergoing chemotherapy. As many of us personally know, chemo saves lives, but also has profound effects. Most commonly, it greatly reduces immunity, which makes our little girl very vulnerable to any contagious illness. Lydia, who has always thrived in school, has not been able to attend for over a month. Now, her oncologist has authorized her return to school with the qualification that she and her classmates routinely wear masks to protect her from what would likely be a fatal illness. Lydia is elated, yet under HB 361, Lydia would not be able to return to school because the school district could not require her fellow students to mask.”
HB 361 will also be considered by the Senate with the Senate Education Committee set to hold a hearing on it soon. It also needs the full Senate and governor’s approval to become law.",https://newhampshirebulletin.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/maskingnhbill-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-04-03 05:01:54.961038

(Jason Kempin/Getty Images)The nation’s historically Black colleges and universities, known as HBCUs, are wondering how to survive in an uncertain and contentious educational climate as the Trump administration downsizes the scope and purpose of the U.S. Department of Education — while cutting away at federal funding for higher education.
In January, President Donald Trump signed an executive order pausing federal grants and loans, alarming HBCUs, where most students rely on Pell Grants or federal aid. The order was later rescinded, but ongoing cuts leave key support systems in political limbo, said Denise Smith, deputy director of higher education policy and a senior fellow at The Century Foundation, a left-leaning think tank.
Leaders worry about Trump’s rollback of the Justice40 Initiative, a climate change program that relied on HBCUs to tackle environmental justice issues, she said. And there’s uncertainty around programs such as federal work-study and TRIO, which provides college access services to disadvantaged students.
“People are being mum because we’re starting to see a chilling effect,” Smith said. “There’s real fear that resources could be lost at any moment — even the ones schools already know they need to survive.”
Most students at HBCUs rely on Pell Grants or other federal aid, and a fifth of Black college graduates matriculate from HBCUs. Other minority-serving institutions, known as MSIs, that focus on Hispanic and American Indian populations also heavily depend on federal aid.
“It’s still unclear what these cuts will mean for HBCUs and MSIs, even though they’re supposedly protected,” Smith said.
States may be unlikely to make up any potential federal funding cuts to their public HBCUs. And the schools already have been underfunded by states compared with predominantly white schools.










There’s real fear that resources could be lost at any moment — even the ones schools already know they need to survive.


– Denise Smith, deputy director of higher education policy and a senior fellow at The Century Foundation


Congress created public, land-grant universities under the Morrill Act of 1862 to serve the country’s agricultural and industrial industries, providing 10 million acres taken from tribes and offering it for public universities such as Auburn and the University of Georgia. But Black students were excluded.
The 1890 Morrill Act required states to either integrate or establish separate land-grant institutions for Black students — leading to the creation of many HBCUs. These schools have since faced chronic underfunding compared with their majority-white counterparts.
‘None of them are equitable’
In 2020, the average endowment of white land-grant universities was $1.9 billion, compared with just $34 million for HBCUs, according to Forbes.
There are other HBCUs that don’t stem from the 1890 law, including well-known private schools such as Fisk University, Howard University, Morehouse College and Spelman College. But more than three-fourths of HBCU students attend public universities, meaning state lawmakers play a significant role in their funding and oversight.
Marybeth Gasman, an endowed chair in education and a distinguished professor at Rutgers University, isn’t impressed by what states have done for HBCUs and other minority-serving institutions so far. She said she isn’t sure there is a state model that can bridge the massive funding inequities for these institutions, even in states better known for their support.
“I don’t think North Carolina or Maryland have done a particularly good job at the state level. Nor have any of the other states. Students at HBCUs are funded at roughly 50-60% of what students at [predominately white institutions] are funded. That’s not right,” said Gasman.
“Most of the bipartisan support has come from the U.S. Congress and is the result of important work by HBCUs and affiliated organizations. I don’t know of a state model that works well, as none of them are equitable.”
Tribes, Native students sue feds over education cuts

Under federal law, states that accept federal land-grant funding are required to match every dollar with state funds.
But in 2023, the Biden administration sent letters to 16 governors warning them that their public Black land-grant institutions had been underfunded by more than $12 billion over three decades.
Tennessee State University alone had a $2.1 billion gap with the University of Tennessee, Knoxville.
At a February meeting hosted by the Tennessee Black Caucus of State Legislators, Tennessee State interim President Dwayne Tucker said the school is focused on asking lawmakers this year for money to keep the school running.
Otherwise, Tucker said at the time, the institution could run out of cash around April or May.
“That’s real money. That’s the money we should work on,” Tucker said, according to a video of the forum.
In some states, lawsuits to recoup long-standing underfunding have been one course of action.
In Maryland, a landmark $577 million legal settlement was reached in 2021 to address decades of underfunding at four public HBCUs.
In Georgia, three HBCU students sued the state in 2023 for underfunding of three HBCUs.
In Tennessee, a recent state report found Tennessee State University has been shortchanged roughly $150 million to $544 million over the past 100 years.
But Tucker said he thinks filing a lawsuit doesn’t make much sense for Tennessee State.
“There’s no account payable set up with the state of Tennessee to pay us $2.1 billion,” Tucker said at the February forum. “And if we want to make a conclusion about whether [that money] is real or not … you’re going to have to sue the state of Tennessee, and I don’t think that makes a whole lot of sense.”
Economic anchors
There are 102 HBCUs across 19 states, Washington, D.C., and the U.S. Virgin Islands, though a large number of HBCUs are concentrated in the South.
Alabama has the most, with 14, and Pennsylvania has the farthest north HBCU.
Why Alabama can’t control college tuition costs

Beyond education, HBCUs contribute roughly $15 billion annually to their local economies, generate more than 134,000 jobs and create $46.8 billion in career earnings, proving themselves to be economic anchors in under-resourced regions.
Homecoming events at HBCUs significantly bolster local economies, local studies show. North Carolina Central University’s homecoming contributes approximately $2.5 million to Durham’s economy annually.
Similarly, Hampton University’s 2024 homecoming was projected to inject around $3 million into the City of Hampton and the coastal Virginia region, spurred by increased visitor spending and retail sales. In Tallahassee, Florida A&M University’s 2024 homecoming week in October generated about $5.1 million from Sunday to Thursday.
Their significance is especially pronounced in Southern states — such as North Carolina, where HBCUs account for just 16% of four-year schools but serve 45% of the state’s Black undergraduate population.
Smith has been encouraged by what she’s seen in states such as Maryland, North Carolina and Tennessee, which have a combined 20 HBCUs among them. Lawmakers have taken piecemeal steps to expand support for HBCUs through policy and funding, she noted.
Tennessee became the first state in 2018 to appoint a full-time statewide higher education official dedicated to HBCU success for institutions such as Fisk and Tennessee State. Meanwhile, North Carolina launched a bipartisan, bicameral HBCU Caucus in 2023 to advocate for its 10 HBCUs, known as the NC10, and spotlight their $1.7 billion annual economic impact.
“We created a bipartisan HBCU caucus because we needed people in both parties to understand these institutions’ importance. If you represent a district with an HBCU, you should be connected to it,” said North Carolina Democratic Sen. Gladys Robinson, an alum of private HBCU Bennett College and state HBCU North Carolina A&T State University.
“It took constant education — getting folks to come and see, talk about what was going on,” she recalled. “It’s like beating the drum constantly until you finally hear the beat.”
US Education Department threatens yanking funds for schools that use race in decisions

For Robinson, advocacy for HBCUs can be a tough task, especially when fellow lawmakers aren’t aware of the stories of these institutions. North Carolina A&T was among the 1890 land-grant universities historically undermatched in federal agricultural and extension funding.
The NC Promise Tuition Plan, launched in 2018, reduced in-state tuition to $500 per semester and out-of-state tuition to $2,500 per semester at a handful of schools that now include HBCUs Elizabeth City State University and Fayetteville State University; Western Carolina University, a Hispanic-serving institution; and UNC at Pembroke, founded in 1887 to serve American Indians.
Through conversations on the floor of the General Assembly, and with lawmakers on both sides of the aisle, Robinson advocated to ensure Elizabeth City State — a struggling HBCU — was included, which helped revive enrollment and public investment.
“I’m hopeful because we’ve been here before,” Robinson said in an interview.
“These institutions were built out of churches and land by people who had nothing, just so we could be educated,” Robinson said. “We have people in powerful positions across the country. We have to use our strength and our voices. Alumni must step up.
“It’s tough, but not undoable.”
Meanwhile, other states are working to recognize certain colleges that offer significant support to Black college students. California last year passed a law creating a Black-serving Institution designation, the first such title in the country. Schools must have programs focused on Black achievement, retention and graduation rates, along with a five-year plan to improve them. Sacramento State is among the first receiving the designation.
And this session, California state Assemblymember Mike Gipson, a Democrat, introduced legislation that proposes a $75 million grant program to support Black and underserved students over five years through the Designation of California Black-Serving Institutions Grant Program. The bill was most recently referred to the Assembly’s appropriations committee.

(Photo by Graham Stokes for Ohio Capital Journal.

Negotiators from both chambers are optimistic they’ll have a finished product soon. But with the House finalizing its version of the two-year operating budget, lawmakers’ attention could be spread thin.

The core of both proposals is the same — encourage new companies to build power plants with a mix of tax incentives and market protections to maintain a level playing field. Most notable, the bills prohibit monopoly utilities from participating in the energy generation marketplace.
Both bills push utilities to open their books through the traditional ratemaking process instead of nickel-and-diming customers with repeated surcharges. Among those, lawmakers voted to repeal a subsidy for aging coal plants that was approved as part of 2019’s House Bill 6. That rider has already cost Ohio ratepayers more than $455 million.
In exchange for those changes, utilities will see much faster regulatory decisions and a three-year rate setting horizon.
Still, there are differences remaining between the House and Senate bills. The Senate’s tax breaks are more generous than those offered by the House. Both bills also come with secondary programs. The House proposes a pilot program for communities to chip in on small scale power generation to defray their bills. The Senate offers a plan to loan schools money for rooftop solar.
Ohio Consumers’ Counsel Maureen Willis, whose office advocates on behalf of ratepayers, has been mostly supportive of the changes. Willis argued eliminating utility bill riders and repealing the coal plant bailout are major positives.

She also praised a provision in the House bill giving state regulators a formal role in reviewing transmission projects. Under current law, those improvements aren’t evaluated for “reasonableness or prudence.” Critics argue it’s a backdoor to bill customers for costly or unnecessary projects. Willis’ office has filed a complaint with federal regulators criticizing the lack of oversight.
Willis continued to voice concerns about the idea of setting rates on a three-year basis. The figures are supposed to get “trued-up” annually — as in, adjusted to meet reality. But she warns utilities will do their best to ensure rates only ever go up, and lawmakers need to make sure adjustments go up and down.
Still, she said, “We are encouraged by the energy legislation proposed by both chambers of the General Assembly.”
“These efforts set Ohio on a path toward meaningful regulatory reform,” Willis added. “We look forward to continuing our discussions on these important issues with members.”
Reasons for optimism
Speaking to reporters Wednesday, Ohio House Speaker Matt Huffman downplayed negotiations. “There are very small differences,” he said, and voiced little concern about juggling the energy and budget bills at once.
“We could have that,” Huffman allowed. “You know, it’s passed overwhelmingly in both houses, so that wouldn’t take up a lot of time at a session next week, so it could happen.”
State Rep. Adam Holmes, R-Nashport, who heads up the House Energy Committee, was also quick to accentuate the positives.
“We’re so closely aligned,” he said, “I don’t even know if there’s disagreements, just differences — things they inserted and things that we didn’t. So, we’re just going to try to streamline that (Thursday) and then start running with the bill.”
In the Senate, leaders sang from the same hymnal.
“I wouldn’t say there’s a lot of (differences),” the bill’s sponsor, Sen. Bill Reineke, R-Tiffin explained, “but there are some. We’ll continue to work on those and hopefully have some kind of a resolution soon.”
Senate President Rob McColley predicted negotiations would play out “over the next week or two.”
“Maybe by the end of the month, maybe beginning of May, we’ll have some sort of final vote on it,” he added. “Maybe even sooner, if we can find a solution quicker.”
Settling differences
Holmes said he’s keeping an open mind about tax rates. While the Senate eliminates tangible personal property taxes on new power facilities, the House reduced the rate from 25% to 7%.
“I think the 7%, we’re concerned about ensuring that communities that have new generation are equipped to support it correctly with that tax money,” Holmes explained.
Holmes added that he wants to go back over some of the late additions to the bill.
“There are concepts in there that haven’t been vetted as well,” he said. “We’re gonna sit down and do that again — the whole multi-year rate plan — like make sure we have all the controls.”
Reineke doesn’t see any of the disagreements between proposals as “make or break,” but said he doesn’t know yet whether it’s more likely differences stay in or get stripped out. Either way, Reineke doesn’t believe the budget process will be a distraction for energy bill negotiations.
“I think that this is kind of just a conclusion for a lot of work that’s already been done,” he said. “I guess I would look at it the opposite (way). We need to finalize it now while it’s all fresh in our mind and (we) know what the key points are.”

(Photo by Andrew Harnik/Getty Images)The Federal Trade Commission late Tuesday stayed a lawsuit accusing pharmacy middlemen of gaming the system to inflate the price of insulin — a drug millions of Americans need to survive. When it did, it left experts in Ohio and elsewhere trying to figure out if President Donald Trump was trying to sabotage the commission’s work, or if it was simply part of his vendetta against Democrats.
Created in 1914, the FTC is tasked with stopping unfair trade practices — particularly those by big corporations that use their dominance to harm small businesses and consumers. 
Starting around 1980, Republican and then Democratic administrations — which appoint the agency’s commissioners — greatly diminished the role of the FTC and the Antitrust Division of the Justice Department. The argument then prevailed that despite what the laws themselves said, the goal of antitrust law was efficiency, which would supposedly deliver better outcomes for consumers.
But awareness has grown in recent years that the rise of big box stores, health conglomerates, and tech companies hasn’t been to the uniform benefit of consumers. 
In response, the Biden administration began a new era of stepped-up enforcement of laws that had long been on the books. The FTC filed lawsuits against Amazon, to stop the Kroger-Albertson’s merger, and it sued giant health conglomerates. It accused the latter companies of unfairly driving up insulin prices at the expense of diabetics — especially those with low incomes.
That was the case that the FTC stayed on Monday.
The agency did so because two Republican commissioners had recused themselves from the case, saying they had conflicts of interest. A third Republican commissioner hasn’t yet been approved by the Senate. And Trump in March tried to fire the two Democratic appointees, Alvaro Bedoya and Rebecca Kelly Slaughter.
The case was to be heard by the commissioners. But now there aren’t any to hear it.
SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
Bedoya and Slaughter are in court challenging the attempted firings, arguing that the president doesn’t have the power to simply decree a change in the structure of a regulatory commission created by Congress. The suit quotes the Federal Trade Commission Act, which says the president can only remove commissioners “for inefficiency, neglect of duty, or malfeasance in office.”
So long as that lawsuit plays out, the FTC suit against the pharmacy middlemen won’t. 
It alleges that the big three pharmacy middlemen excluded cheaper generic forms of insulin from insurance coverage in order to extract larger rebates from manufacturers’ more costly products.
The three biggest middlemen, or pharmacy benefit managers, control nearly 80% of the insured drug transactions in the United Sates. Each is a part of a conglomerate that also owns a major insurer — UnitedHealth Group, CVS Health and Cigna-Express Scripts. 
As middlemen, the benefit managers decide which drugs are covered, and which of those have low or no copayments. The FTC suit says that since 2012, they’ve been increasingly aggressive about demanding ever-larger, non-transparent rebates — their critics call them kickbacks — from manufacturers in exchange for covering their drugs. 
With insulin, prices were effectively jacked up when the middlemen refused to cover some of the cheapest alternatives at all, the suit said. 
It’s clear that for now, anyway, the insulin suit isn’t going anywhere. What isn’t clear is whether that’s what Trump intended when he tried to remove Bedoya and Slaughter.
“Sadly, this was an entirely foreseeable consequence of illegally attempting to fire the minority commissioners,” they said in a joint statement Tuesday decrying the suspension of the insulin suit.
Foreseeable, yes, but was it intentional? The White House press office didn’t respond to questions Wednesday.
On the one hand, Trump in the past has been critical of the pharmacy middlemen. In his first administration, he floated the idea of ending legal exemptions that allow them to collect rebates from manufacturers in exchange for covering their drugs. And in December, then President-elect Trump said of pharmacy benefit managers, “The horrible middleman that makes more money, frankly, than the drug companies, and they don’t do anything except they’re a middleman,” USA Today reported. “I don’t know who these middlemen are, but they are rich.”
Despite all that, Trump hasn’t taken any meaningful action against the health conglomerates that own the middlemen — or against tech moguls such as Elon Musk, Jeff Bezos, and Mark Zuckerberg, who donated millions to his campaign and his inauguration. Meanwhile, Trump has at least temporarily crippled the antitrust watchdog that has tried to rein them in.
Antonio Ciaccia is a Columbus-based drug-pricing expert who has followed the rise of drug middlemen since Trump’s first term. He said the president is yet to back up his tough talk with concrete action.
“In his first term as president, Trump pushed to eliminate the anti-kickback law exemptions that ballooned the prices of medicines like insulin. The Biden Administration refused to implement the policy,” Ciaccia said. “The FTC’s lawsuit against (pharmacy benefit managers) over their role in inflating the prices of insulin was another opportunity to achieve Trump’s original policy goals albeit via different means. Regardless of the intent, the recent shake-up at the FTC effectively ends that pursuit for the foreseeable future.”

The bills keep coming, one after another, after another.
Ohio Republicans are dominating the “culture wars” over schools and students, joining other states in passing a barrage of new laws involving race, ethnicity and gender with several more in the pipeline.
Both emboldened by President Donald Trump’s success in the 2024 elections and as a backlash against former President Joe Biden, bills pressing the Make America Great agenda in schools have accelerated and come in rapid fire.
In the past year, Ohio’s Republican supermajority has defended in court its 2023 bans of transgender athletes participating in school sports and of “gender-affirming” health care including hormone treatments and blockers for minors.
Since Trump’s November victory, the state has also passed or is still pursuing far right bills including a transgender bathroom ban and a parental bill of rights opposed by the LGBTQ community, while also opening the door for religious study by public school students and attacking “Diversity, Equity and Inclusion (DEI)” efforts in both colleges and K-12 schools.
Ohio transgender bathroom ban bill heads to Gov. Mike DeWine’s desk

The bill affecting colleges, which also includes restrictions on teaching “controversial beliefs,” drew strong opposition but was signed into law by Gov. Mike DeWine last week.
Ohio, the state with the sixth most students, is one of several passing similar bills — but the number and speed of them reflects the state’s shift to the right in recent years. Ohio was once one of the most reliable bellwether states in presidential elections, voting for the national winner in 14 straight elections from 1964 to 2020. But Ohio voted for Trump in 2020 when he lost, and has now backed him in three state elections, and the state is drawing some national attention for what some consider extremism on education and other issues such as abortion.
Troy McIntosh, executive director of education efforts for the Center for Christian Virtues, an Ohio nonprofit whose influence on legislators has grown in recent years, said Trump’s November win and the wave of bills are fueled by parent anger over how some social issues were framed and taught in online classes during the pandemic. It’s also a pushback against Biden giving transgender students more rights in ways some parents feel infringe on their own.
“Part of the message the electorate sent in that election is, ‘look, we need to fix this,’” McIntosh said. “This is not something we support – these progressive, radical in many ways, interpretations of law,  of culture, ethics. So, sure, the (Ohio) General Assembly is responding to what the electorate told them they wanted.”
Democrats, whose opposition to the Trump-aligned bills is regularly outvoted by the state’s Republican supermajority, said the bills distract from more pressing issues like school funding and improving learning, while also being destructive.
“Some of it is just the politics of fear,” said State Senator Kent Smith, a Democrat from the Cleveland area. “It’s a racist agenda, not the ‘out of many, we become one,’ which the country was founded on.”
Bills like those passing in Ohio have cropped up in several states.Texas and Florida have led the way, according to the conservative Heritage Foundation, with other states like Indiana, Oklahoma and Kentucky each passing or proposing different combinations of bills, some directly focused on schools and others lumping schools in with all public services. Ohio was the 23rd state, for example, to pass some form of a parental bill of rights.

Many have centered on rights of transgender youth, which flared into national controversy when the Biden administration made gender identity, not just biological sex, a protected class under Title IX, a 1972 law against sexual discrimination in education. That led to debates over schools allowing transgender youth to use bathrooms they choose and over transgender students participating on sports teams, usually male students transitioning to female.
“We’ve seen really a host of state prohibitions, either through executive order or by legislation, related to gender,” said Jonathan Butcher, a fellow at the conservative Heritage Foundation. “Ohio is in the midst of it.”
Trump is leading the charge to undo Biden’s guidance, most notably with orders in January declaring that there are just two sexes — male and female — and that only biological sex, not gender identity, counts in federal law. But Butcher said states need to take action, particularly with no federal laws in place to carry Trump’s plan out.
“Executive orders are, of course, valuable and strong, but legislation is stronger,” he said. “You need provisions right in law in order for these things to not just take effect, but also remain in effect.”
Butcher said he isn’t as surprised as some at how much legislatures like Ohio’s have acted the last few years, saying it’s typical for changes and tempers to flare when emotional topics are debated, though he sympathizes with feelings of “whiplash” as the nation goes through it.
Ohio’s shift to the right didn’t start with these bills or Trump’s election. Vice President J.D. Vance was elected to the U.S. Senate for Ohio in 2022 and Republican Bernie Moreno just knocked off Democrat Sherrod Brown for Ohio’s other Senate seat in November. Republicans hold the majority in both state legislative houses, plus all major statewide offices including  auditor, attorney general and secretary of state.
Republicans also prevailed in a statewide controversy over how state legislative districts are drawn that many say allows polarization of state politics to continue. Though the state supreme court ruled five times that Republicans had gerrymandered state House and Senate unfairly, Ohio voters sided with Republicans in November on a ballot issue that would have redrawn districts under a new process.
Ohio voters reject Issue 1, leaving politicians in control over map-making process

Critics charge that candidates don’t have to appeal to both sides, since districts are set up so races are really decided in Republican primaries.
“It (the legislature) has definitely moved towards a much more ideological conservative view,” said Christina Collins, a former state school board member who now heads the left-leaning Honesty for Ohio Education nonprofit.
“It is easier for them to keep up these attacks and to keep the rhetoric going and the vitriol and to keep stirring their base, which is what seems to be happening,” she said.
Ohio’s transgender bathroom ban, though proposed months earlier, passed after the November election. The state legislature followed that by passing a bill in December allowing students to leave school during the school day for religious lessons and creating a “parental bill of rights” that requires schools to tell parents about “any request by a student to identify as a gender that does not align with the student’s biological sex.”
Schools must also inform parents before students can receive any mental health services, which would also include counseling over gender identity or sexual preference. While supporters praise the bill for letting parents, not schools, decide how to handle student sexuality issues, others blasted the bill as requiring schools to “out” students and expose them to violence.
Schools have until July to set policy for how to inform parents, but counselors are bracing for a “chilling effect” the bill would have on students seeking any type of help.
“Many students struggle with unsafe or unwelcoming homes, homes ravaged by poverty or stress, or even comfortable homes where students just sometimes feel the need to vent about family matters,” Douglas Cook testified in hearings on the bill on behalf of the Ohio School  Counselors Association. “School counselors’ offices are safe spaces for those students.”
“This will likely be incredibly jarring for students and result in their being scared that they will lose the privacy of having a safe listener available to them at school,” Cook added.
This year, after Trump started his own campaign in January against what he called “radical indoctrination” in schools, Ohio quickly passed a ban on DEI in training and hiring in state colleges. The law also regulates teaching of “controversial beliefs” including foreign policy, diversity, immigration, abortion and climate change.
Gov. Mike DeWine signed that ban Friday after heated debates with 1,500 pieces of written testimony submitted and student marches in protest. Opponents labeled it the “HIgher Education Destruction Act” that amounts to state censorship of educators.
Ohio Gov. DeWine signs higher ed bill regulating classroom discussion and banning diversity efforts

State Sen. Jerry Cirino, the bill’s author said it “will return our public universities and colleges to their rightful mission of education rather than indoctrination.”
In the latest move, bills blocking DEI in training and hiring, though not lessons, in K-12 schools are being heard in the Ohio House and Senate.
Legislators are also seeking a “Given Name Act” that would yank funding from schools that let students change their name or pronouns and another bill that would declare the Ten Commandments a historical document like the Constitution or Magna Carta so schools can post them.
Support from voters for the new laws isn’t clear, though a poll in February led by Bowling Green State University found some backing. The poll found residents backed Trump’s order that there are just two sexes 61 percent to 32 percent. Support for anti-DEI policies was more narrow, 49 percent to 42 percent.

Reporting Highlights

Unexpected Role: Flight attendants were told they would fly rock bands, sports teams and sun-seekers. Then Global Crossing Airlines started expanding into federal deportation flights.
Human Struggles: Some flight attendants said they ignored orders not to interact with detainees. “I’d say ‘hola’ back,” said one flight attendant. “We’re not jerks.”
Safety Concerns: Flight attendants received training in how to evacuate passengers but said they weren’t told how to usher out detainees whose hands and legs were bound by shackles.

These highlights were written by the reporters and editors who worked on this story.

The deportation flight was in the air over Mexico when chaos erupted in the back of the plane, the flight attendant recalled. A little girl had collapsed. She had a high fever and was taking ragged, frantic breaths.
The flight attendant, a young woman who went by the nickname Lala, said she grabbed the plane’s emergency oxygen bottle and rushed past rows of migrants chained at the wrists and ankles to reach the girl and her parents.
By then, Lala was accustomed to the hard realities of working charter flights for Immigration and Customs Enforcement. She’d learned to obey instructions not to look the passengers in the eyes, not to greet them or ask about their well-being. But until the girl collapsed, Lala had managed to escape an emergency.
Lala worked for Global Crossing Airlines, the dominant player in the loose network of deportation contractors known as ICE Air. GlobalX, as the charter company is also called, is lately in the news. Two weeks ago, it helped the Trump administration fly hundreds of Venezuelans to El Salvador despite a federal court order blocking the deportations, triggering a showdown that experts fear could become a full-blown constitutional crisis.
In interviews with ProPublica, Lala and six other current and former GlobalX flight attendants provided a window into a part of the deportation process that is rarely seen and little understood. For migrants who have spent months or years trying to reach this country and live here, it is the last act, the final bit of America they may experience.
All but one of the flight attendants requested anonymity or asked that only a nickname be used, fearing retribution or black marks as they looked for new jobs in an insular industry.
Because ICE, GlobalX and other charter carriers did not respond to questions after being provided with detailed lists of this story’s findings, the flight attendants’ individual accounts are hard to verify. But their stories are consistent with one another. They are also generally consistent with what has been said about ICE Air in legalfilings, newsaccounts, academic research and publicly released copies of the ICE Air Operations Handbook.
That morning over Mexico, Lala said, the girl’s oxygen saturation level was 70% — perilously low compared with a healthy person’s 95% or higher. Her temperature was 102.3 degrees. The flight had a nurse on contract who worked alongside its security guards. But beyond giving the girl Tylenol, the nurse left the situation in Lala’s hands, she recalled.
Lala broke the rule about talking to detainees. The parents told Lala their daughter had a history of asthma. The mom, who Lala said had epilepsy, seemed on the verge of her own medical crisis.
Lala placed the oxygen mask on the girl’s face. The nurse removed her socks to keep her from further overheating. Lala counted down the minutes, praying for the girl to keep breathing.
The stories shared by ICE Air flight attendants paint a different picture of deportations from the one presented to the public, especially under President Donald Trump. On social media, the White House has depicted a military operation carried out with ruthless efficiency, using Air Force C-17s, ICE agents in tactical vests and soldiers in camo.
The reality is that 85% of the administration’s “removal” flights — 254 flights as of March 21, according to the advocacy group Witness at the Border — have been on charter planes. Military flights have now all but ceased. While there are ICE officers and hired security guards on the charters, the crew members on board are civilians, ordinary people swept up in something most didn’t knowingly sign up for.
When the flight attendants joined GlobalX, it was a startup with big plans. It sold investors and new hires alike on a vision of VIP clients, including musicians and sports teams, and luxury destinations, especially in the Caribbean. “You can’t beat the eXperience,” read a company tagline.

But as the airline grew, more and more of its planes were filled with migrants in chains. Some flight attendants were livid about it.
Last year, an anonymous GlobalX employee sent an all-caps, all-staff screed that ricocheted around the startup. “WHERE IS THE COMPANY GOING?” the email asked. “YOU SIGNED A 5 YEAR CONTRACT WITH ICE? … WHAT HAPPENED TO THIS BECOMING A PRESTIGE CHARTER AIRLINE?”
One flight attendant said he kept waiting for the sports teams his new bosses had talked about as he flew deportation routes. “You know, the NFL charters, the NBA charters, whatever the hockey one is …” he said.
A second said his planes’ air conditioning kept breaking — an experience consistent with at least two publicly reported onboard incidents — and their lavatories kept breaking, something another flight attendant reported as well. But the planes kept flying. “They made us flush with water bottles,” he said.
But the flight attendants were most concerned about their inability to treat their passengers humanely — and to keep them safe. (In 2021, an ICE spokesperson told the publication Capital & Main that the agency “follows best practices when it comes to the security, safety and welfare of the individuals returned to their countries of origin.”)
They worried about what would happen in an emergency. Could they really get over a hundred chained passengers off the plane in time?
“They never taught us anything regarding the immigration flights,” one said. “They didn’t tell us these people were going to be shackled, wrists to fucking ankles.”
“We have never gotten a clear answer on what we do in an ICE Air evacuation,” another said. “They will not give us an answer.”
“It’s only a matter of time,” a third said, before a deportation flight ends in disaster.
Lala didn’t think she had a chance at a flight attendant job. She hadn’t, in truth, remembered applying to GlobalX until a recruiter called to say the startup was coming to her city. “But I guess I did apply through LinkedIn?” she said. She’d been working an office job — long hours, little flexibility — and was looking for something new.
The job interviews were held at a resort hotel. The room was packed with dozens of aspirants when Lala showed up. After the first round, only about 20 were asked to stay. She couldn’t believe she was one of them. After the second round came a job offer: $26 an hour plus a daily expense allowance. Soon Lala got a uniform: a blue cardigan, a white polo shirt and an eye-catching scarf in cyan and light green.
For part of her Federal Aviation Administration-mandated four-week training, her class stayed in a motel with a pool at the edge of Miami International Airport. Just across the street, on the fourth floor of a concrete-clad office building ringed by palm trees, was GlobalX’s headquarters.
“In the beginning, we were told that because it’s a charter, it’s only gonna be elites, celebrities,” Lala said. “Everybody was really excited.”
But flying was not going to be all glitz. The real reason for having flight attendants is safety. GlobalX was certified by the FAA as a Part 121 scheduled air carrier, the same as United or Delta, and it and its crew members were subject to the same strict standards.
“We’re there to evacuate you,” one recruit told ProPublica. “Yes, we make good drinks, but we evacuate you.”
Lala’s class practiced water landings in the pool at the nearby Pan Am Flight Academy. They practiced door drills — yelling out commands, shoving open heavy exit doors — in a replica Airbus A320 cabin. They learned CPR and how to put out fires. They took written and physical tests, and if they didn’t score at least 90%, they had to retake them.
They were reminded, over and over, that their job was a vocation, one with a professional code: No matter who the passengers were, flight attendants were in charge of the cabin, responsible for safety in the air.
Lala’s official “airman” certificate arrived from the FAA a few weeks after training was done. She was cleared to fly, ready to see the world.
But what she would see wasn’t what she signed up for. The company was growing beyond glamorous charters. GlobalX was moving into the deportation business.
Her bosses delivered the news casually, she recalled: “It was like, ‘Oh yeah, we got a government contract.’”
The new graduates were offered a single posting: Harlingen, Texas. Deportation flights were five days a week, sometimes late into the night. Lala went to Guatemala, Honduras, Colombia and, for refueling, Panama.
A standard flight had more than a dozen private security guards — contractors working for the firm Akima — along with a single ICE officer, two nurses, and a hundred or more detainees. (Akima did not respond to a request for comment.) The guards were in charge of delivering food and water to the detainees and taking them to the lavatories. This left the flight attendants, whose presence was required by the FAA, with little to do.
“Arm and disarm doors, that was our duty,” Lala said.
The flights had their own set of rules, which the crew members said they learned from a company policy manual or from chief flight attendants. Don’t talk to the detainees. Don’t feed them. Don’t make eye contact. Don’t walk down the aisles without a guard escorting you. Don’t sit in aisle seats, where detainees could get close to you. Don’t wear your company-issued scarf because of “safety concerns that a detainee might grab it and use it against us,” Lala said.
“You don’t do nothing,” said a member of another GlobalX class. “Just sit down in your seats and be quiet.” If a detainee looked at him, he was supposed to look out the window.
A rare public statement from the company about life aboard ICE Air came in a 2023 earnings call with GlobalX founder and then-CEO Ed Wegel, when he discussed the company’s work for federal agencies like ICE. GlobalX employees “essentially don’t do much on the airplane,” Wegel said. “Our flight attendants are there in case of an emergency. The passengers are monitored by guards that are placed on board the airplane by one of those agencies.”
Fielding a question about how GlobalX ensures passengers are treated humanely, Wegel continued: “There have been threats made to our crew members, and they’re especially trained to deal with those. But we haven’t seen any mistreatment at all.”
Flight attendants said they had little to do but sit in their jumpseats after delivering the preflight safety briefing in English to the mostly Spanish-speaking passengers. Above 10,000 feet, the two in the rear usually moved to passenger rows near the cockpit, then sat again. Some did crosswords. Others took photos out the window. On a deportation to Guatemala, one saw his first erupting volcano.
Lala had been scared before her first deportation flight, worried that violence might break out. But fear soon gave way to discomfort at how detainees were treated. “Not being able to serve them, not being able to look at them, I didn’t think that was right,” she said.
Some flight attendants, drawn to the profession because they liked taking care of people, couldn’t help but break protocol with passengers. “If they said ‘hola’ or something,” one said, “I’d say ‘hola’ back. We’re not jerks.”
Another recalled taking a planeload of children and their escorts on a domestic transfer from the southern border to an airport in New York. He tried to slip snacks to the kids. “Even the chaperones were like, ‘Don’t give them any food,’” he said. “And I’m like, ‘Where is your humanity?’” (A second flight attendant said that children on a New York flight were fed by their escorts.)
While flight attendants were allowed to interact with the guards, the dynamic was uncomfortable. It came down to a question of who was in charge — and which agency, ICE or the FAA, ultimately held sway. (The FAA declined to comment on this story and directed questions to ICE.)
The guards often asked flight attendants to heat up the food they brought from home. They asked for drinks, for ice. “They treated us like we were their maids,” said Akilah Sisk, a former flight attendant from Texas.
“In their eyes, the detainees are not the passengers,” another flight attendant said. “The passengers are the guards. And we’re there for the guards.”
Some guards thumbed their noses at the FAA safety rules that flight attendants were supposed to enforce while airborne, multiple flight attendants recalled. “One reported me because I asked him to sit down in the last 10 minutes,” Sisk said. “But you’re still on a freaking plane. You gotta listen to our words.”
Flight attendants said that if they told guards to fasten seatbelts during takeoff or stow carry-ons under a seat, they risked getting reported to their bosses at GlobalX, who they said wanted to keep ICE happy. The guards would complain to the in-flight supervisor, Sisk said, and eventually it would get back to the flight attendant.
“We’d get an email from somebody in management: ‘Why are you guys causing problems?’” another flight attendant recalled. “They were more worried about losing the contract than about anything else.”
Nothing bothered flight attendants more than the fact that most of their passengers were in chains. What would happen if a flight had to be evacuated?
Most of the migrants crowding the back seats of ICE Air’s planes have not been, historically, convicted criminals. ICE makes restraints mandatory nonetheless. “Detainees transported by ICE Air aircraft will be fully restrained by the use of handcuffs, waist chains, and leg irons,“ reads an unredacted version of the 2015 ICE Air Operations Handbook, which was obtained by the Center for Constitutional Rights, a legal advocacy group.
The handbook allows for other equipment “in special circumstances, i.e., spit masks, mittens, leg braces, cargo straps, humane restraint blanket, etc.” Multiple lawsuits on behalf of African asylum-seekers concern the use of one such item, known as the Wrap, a cross between a straitjacket and a sleeping bag. A flight attendant said detainees restrained in the device are strapped upright in their seats or, if less compliant, lengthwise across a row of seats. Getting “burritoed, I call it,” the person said.
The Department of Homeland Security’s Office for Civil Rights and Civil Liberties investigated the asylum-seekers’ complaints and found ICE lacked “sufficient policies” on the Wrap, but how the immigration agency addressed the finding is not publicly known. ICE responded to one lawsuit by saying detainees were not abused; it said another should be dismissed, in part because it was filed in the wrong place. The cases are pending.
Use of the Wrap continues. A video from Seattle’s Boeing Field taken in February shows officers and guards carrying a wrapped migrant into the cabin of a deportation plane.

Neither the ICE Air handbook, nor FAA regulations, nor flight attendant training in Miami explained how to empty a plane full of people whose movements were, by design, so severely hampered. Shackled detainees didn’t even qualify as “able-bodied” enough to sit in exit rows.
To flight attendants, the restraints seemed at odds with the FAA’s “90-second rule,” a decades-old manufacturing standard that says an aircraft must be built for full evacuation in 90 seconds even with half the exits blocked.
Lala and others said no one told them how to evacuate passengers in chains. “Honestly, I don’t know what we would do,” she said.
The flight attendants are not alone in voicing concerns.
In an interview with ProPublica, Bobby Laurie, an airline safety expert and former flight attendant, called the arrangement on ICE Air flights “disturbing.”
“Part of flight attendant training is locating those passengers who can help you in an evacuation,” Laurie told ProPublica. That would have to be the guards. “But if they have to help you,” who is helping the detainees, Laurie wondered.
According to formal ICE Air incident reports reviewed by Capital & Main, the deportation network had at least six accidents requiring evacuations between 2014 and 2019. In at least two cases, both on a carrier called World Atlantic, the evacuations were led not by flight attendants but by untrained guards. Both took longer than 90 seconds, though not by much: two-and-a-half minutes for the first, “less than 2 minutes” for the next. But in a third case, it took seven minutes for 115 shackled detainees to escape a smoke-filled jet.
In one of the World Atlantic incidents, part of the landing gear broke, a wing caught fire and the smell of burning rubber seeped in, according to investigative records obtained by the University of Washington Center for Human Rights. In an email to ICE Air officials, an agency employee aboard the plane later wrote that flight attendants made no emergency announcements for passengers. The flight attendants simply got themselves out.
The ICE officer, guards and nurse were “confused on what to do and in which direction to exit during distress,” the officer wrote. He said that other than the flight crew, “no one has received any training on emergency evacuation situations.”
The University of Washington’s collection does not include findings or recommendations from ICE based on what happened, and ICE did not say what they were when asked by ProPublica. The National Transportation Safety Board said that after the accident, World Atlantic launched a campaign to reinspect landing gear, gave employees and contractors further training, and revised its procedures for inspections. The airline did not respond to questions from ProPublica.

Other reports obtained by the University of Washington mention fuel spills, loss of cabin air pressure and a “large altercation” on ICE Air after 2019 but no more evacuations, at least as of June 2022. More recent incidents that have been mentioned in the press include an engine fire last summer on World Atlantic and a failed GlobalX air conditioning unit that sent 11 detainees to the hospital with “heat-related injuries.”
The rare guidance some flight attendants said they received on carrying out ICE Air evacuations came during briefings from pilots. What they heard, they said, was chilling and went against their training.
“Just get up and leave,” one recalled a GlobalX pilot telling him. “That’s it. … Save your life first.”
He understood the instructions to mean that evacuating detainees was not a priority, or even the flight attendants’ responsibility. The detainees were in other people’s hands, or in no one’s.
When asked if they got similar guidance from pilots, three flight attendants said they did not, and one did not answer. Two more, like the first, said pilots gave them instructions that they took to mean they shouldn’t help detainees after opening the exit doors.
“That was the normal briefing,” said a flight attendant from Lala’s class. “‘If a fire occurs in the cabin, if we land on water, don’t check on the immigrants. Just make sure that you and the guards and the people that work for the government get off.’”
“It was as if the detainees’ lives were worthless,” said the other.
The day the girl collapsed on Lala’s flight, the pilot turned the plane around and they crossed back into the United States.
The flight landed in Arizona. Paramedics rushed on board and connected the girl to their own oxygen bottle. They began shuttling her off the plane. Her parents tried to join. But the guards stopped the father.
Shocked, Lala approached the ICE officer in charge. “This is not OK!” she yelled. The mom had seizures. The family needed to stay together.
But the officer said it was impossible. Only one parent could go to the hospital. The other, as Lala understood it, “was going to get deported.”
Most of the flight attendants who spoke with ProPublica are now gone from GlobalX. Some left because they found other jobs. Some left even though they hadn’t. Some left because the charter company, as it focused more and more on deportations, shut down the hub in their city.
Lala eventually left because of the little girl and her family, because she couldn’t do the deportation flights anymore. Her GlobalX uniform hung in her closet for a time, a reminder of her career as a flight attendant. Recently, she said, she threw it away.
She never learned whether the little girl lived or died. Lala just watched her mom follow her off the plane, then watched the dad return to his seat.
“I cried after that,” she said. She bought her own ticket home.",https://michiganadvance.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/propublica_iceflights-edits-2_preview_maxWidth_1600_maxHeight_1600-1-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-04-03 05:01:54.961038

Jerry Moran's photo at the virtual town hall to express concerns over Moran's response to Elon Musk's Department of Government Efficiency. (Kansas Reflector screen capture from Prairie Hollow Youtube channel)Many years ago, when I interviewed Wes Jackson for a “Sunflower Journeys” story related to his work at The Land Institute near Salina, he referenced a book by his friend Wendell Berry — “The Unsettling of America.”
A line he told me has been going through my head lately: “They didn’t know what they were doing because they didn’t know what they were un-doing.”
Those may not be the precise words, but that’s the gist of it. It pertained to Berry’s assessment of the way that industrialized agriculture historically plowed through the native prairies of the continent without bothering to understand the nature of the ecological relationships that were disrupted and destroyed.
I recall this quote as I consider what’s happening to the social and cultural relationships being dismantled by the wrecking crew known as DOGE, the so-called “government efficiency” team led by Elon Musk.
They, too, don’t know what they’re doing, it seems to me. More significantly, they don’t care what they’re un-doing. It leaves many of us wondering what the real objective of this ongoing assault on our federal workforce and government institutions may be.
Is this really an effort to reduce the federal debt and deficit or a way to bring our democratic system of government crashing down to consolidate power in the hands of oligarchs, autocrats and Christian Nationalists? Are Republicans in Congress refraining from questioning it because it suits their goals and gives them a degree of deniability while insulating them from responsibility?
Town halls have sprung up across the nation as Americans express their concern and attempt to get some answers from their congressional representatives. A number of these gatherings have taken place in Kansas over the past few weeks.
As Grace Hills reported in a Kansas Reflector piece a few weeks ago, my wife, Laura Mead, spearheaded the organization of a virtual town hall directed at Sen. Jerry Moran in February. Neither he nor any of his staff responded to our invitation, so participants directed their questions and comments to an empty chair with his name and photo placed upon it.
We staged this as an event on Zoom, with more than 30 participants from across Kansas joining us to deliver their comments and pose their questions to the senator. There was a mix of political affiliations, veterans of both the Korean and Vietnam Wars, farmers and federal employees, as well as disability advocates, and mothers concerned about cuts to Medicaid and social services.
We streamed the event live on YouTube, where more than a thousand others tuned in that Saturday afternoon for the three-hour session and where more than 13,000 have since viewed the video.
As we ended the session, we requested that Moran provide a response to the concerns and questions directed to him. Everyone had maintained a respectful tone of civility, and no one was intent upon slandering his character. They simply wanted him to respond and acknowledge that he was listening and cognizant of their concerns.
We provided the senator’s office with a report of what had transpired as well as with links to the recording of the event. We edited an abridged version along with a six-minute “highlight reel,” also providing links to those, expecting that the senator or a senior staff member would take a few minutes to view the material.
We had initially decided to direct our town hall to Moran because he appears to be the only Republican representing Kansas at the federal level who might possibly be responsive.
It has been more than five weeks since this town hall took place, and we have yet to receive a response of any kind from Moran or his staff.
In the meantime, we have maintained a glimmer of hope that the senator will eventually stand up to the DOGE juggernaut. He expressed his own concerns about the impact cuts are having on Kansas farmers and veterans and voiced muted criticism of the recent debacle involving cabinet secretaries in a Signal group chat about the attack on Houthi rebels in Yemen.
As President Donald Trump and his administration “flood the zone” with all kinds of destabilizing actions, from market-tanking tariffs to hints that the executive branch is not bound to comply with court orders, many of us are upset and angered by the dissolution of the values we have always associated with this country.
A protest rally is scheduled to take place this Saturday, April 5, on the east steps of the state Capitol in Topeka. As we have seen with weekly protests in Lawrence and a recent one in Kansas City, the number of people opposed to the DOGE cuts and to the direction this administration is taking continues to grow. The turnout for Saturday’s rally will be another indicator of how Kansans feel about the situation.
The unsettling of America continues.
I wonder if Moran and some of his colleagues might feel a bit unsettled, too, especially after Cory Booker’s rabble-rousing address in the Senate this week.

Seventy percent of Americans, including majorities of both Democratic and Republican voters, say that marijuana should be legal. Yet far too often, lawmakers choose to either ignore this constituency or treat them with outright hostility.
In Republican-led states like Nebraska, Ohio, and Texas, elected officials are making it clear that election outcomes legalizing marijuana no longer matter to them. And in Democratic-led states like Maryland, Michigan, and New Jersey, lawmakers are seeking to undermine existing legalization markets by drastically hiking marijuana-related taxes.
In all cases, elected officials are treating cannabis consumers as targets, not constituents.
Earlier this year, Republican lawmakers in South Dakota sought to repeal the state’s medical cannabis access law, despite 70% of voters having approved it. The effort failed, but only by a single vote.
In Nebraska, lawmakers are also considering legislation to roll back the state’s voter-approved medical marijuana law — and Republican Attorney General Mike Hilgers has urged lawmakers to ignore the election results altogether.
In Ohio, GOP lawmakers in the Senate recently approved legislation to rescind many of the legalization provisions approved by 57% of voters in 2023. Changes advanced by lawmakers include limiting home-cultivation rights and creating new crimes for adults who share cannabis with one another or purchase legal cannabis products from out of state.
In Texas, Republican Attorney General Ken Paxton has sued several cities, including Dallas, for implementing voter-approved ordinances decriminalizing marijuana possession. As a result, local lawmakers in various cities — including Lockhart and Bastrop — are ignoring voters’ decisions to amend their municipal marijuana policies rather than face costly litigation.

In Idaho, Republican Gov. Brad Little signed mandatory minimum penalties into law for low-level marijuana possession. And GOP lawmakers have approved a constitutional amendment forbidding voters from weighing in on any future ballot measure to legalize marijuana.
And in Florida, where a 2024 marijuana legalization narrowly failed — it received majority support but less than the 60% threshold required under the state law — Republican Gov. Ron DeSantis is leading the charge to make it harder for future petitions to qualify for the ballot.
These concerted attacks are an explicit reminder that the war on cannabis and its consumers remains ongoing — and in some cases is even escalating.
Blue states haven’t made moves to roll back legalization or reverse election results. But several Democratic governors are looking to balance their budget deficits on the backs of consumers.
For instance, New Jersey Gov. Phil Murphy has proposed raising the state’s marijuana-related taxes nearly five-fold. A Maryland budget proposal seeks to nearly double the special sales tax consumers pay on retail marijuana purchases. And in Michigan, Gov. Gretchen Whitmer has proposed an additional 32% wholesale tax on cannabis.
If enacted, these proposed increases will not only lighten consumers’ wallets, but they will also hurt state-licensed businesses. As lawmakers push marijuana prices artificially higher, many consumers will exit the legal market and begin patronizing the unregulated marketplace, undermining one of the primary goals of legalization.
Regardless of whether you live in a red or blue state, or in a jurisdiction where cannabis is legal or illicit, it’s time for legalization advocates to stand up and assert themselves. Cannabis consumers are neither criminals nor ATMs. They’re hard-working responsible adults. And they vote.
Now is not the time to become complacent or presume that marijuana will somehow legalize itself. Change only occurs when advocates agitate for it — and when elected officials fear political consequences for failing to abide by voters’ demands.
Those who support legalizing marijuana aren’t part of the ideological fringe. They’re the majority. It’s time for advocates to act like it — and for lawmakers to treat cannabis consumers with the respect they deserve.

(David Montgomery/Stateline)WATER VALLEY, Texas — On a recent day when the wind gusted close to 40 miles per hour, 82-year-old George Neill was making repairs on his ranch, oblivious to the nearby cluster of wind turbines churning the sky behind him.
“After about a year, you never know the things are here,” said Neill, who leases part of his West Texas property to an East Coast-based renewable energy company that placed three wind turbines on it four years ago.
Hundreds of other wind turbines stretch across this landscape, instantly visible to motorists traveling to nearby San Angelo and other towns. The turbines aren’t the only renewable energy producers amid the mesas: From a distance, a glistening array of solar panels resembles a small lake.
Texas is famous for producing oil and gas, but renewable energy has become deeply embedded in the state’s culture and economy. Texas led the nation in generating electricity from wind power and utility-scale solar power in 2023, and wind and solar energy projects contribute tax revenue to local governments and struggling school districts. Texas landowners are expected to receive nearly $30 billion in lease payments under current and expected projects, according to an industry study.
But in recent years, Texas has loosened its political embrace of alternative energy. For the second legislative session in a row, many Texas lawmakers are trying to derail or curb future renewable energy projects.










They are relatively new players to the market, so there’s going to be pushback from incumbents.


– Joshua Rhodes, research scientist at the University of Texas at Austin


The shift is rooted in a number of a factors, including the second Trump administration’s antipathy toward renewables and an aggressive recommitment to fossil fuels in Texas energy policy. There is lingering concern over the reliability of the state’s electrical grid, after all types of power sources failed during a devastating 2021 winter storm. Some people object to the aesthetics of wind and solar farms, or note that turbines and panels can harm some wildlife.
Texas is not alone. Once focused on stopping individual projects at the local level, renewable energy opponents have been making inroads in other state legislatures, too. They have received backing from the oil and gas industry. And they’ve been galvanized by the 2022 passage of the Inflation Reduction Act, the largest-ever attempt to speed the transition to clean energy.
In neighboring Oklahoma, for example, hundreds of people rallied at the state Capitol in January to urge Republican Gov. Kevin Stitt to issue an executive order halting new wind and solar projects. Like Texas, Oklahoma is a major oil and natural gas producer, but it generated 45% of its total in-state electricity from renewable resources in 2023.
Climate disasters are on the rise. These states want to make oil companies pay.

Stitt, a strong supporter of renewable energy, is highly unlikely to issue such an order. But he will leave office in two years, and several Republicans discussed as possible successors appeared at the rally. One of them, Attorney General Gentner Drummond, last month on social media criticized what he called “the green energy scam” and urged Stitt and state lawmakers to tighten wind farm rules during the current session.
In Arizona, the House earlier this year approved a bill that would bar wind farm projects within a dozen miles of any property zoned for residential use — a restriction that would apply to about 90% of the land in the state, according to an analysis by the Arizona Republic.
In Ohio, a 2021 law allowing county commissioners to create restricted areas where utility-scale solar and wind projects can’t be built has had a huge impact, as 26 Ohio counties have banned renewable energy projects. This year, GOP lawmakers have introduced legislation that would end all state solar subsidies.
And in Missouri, Republican legislators are pushing a bill that would raise taxes on farmers who lease their land for wind or solar energy projects.
The expanding opposition to renewables isn’t unexpected, said Joshua Rhodes, a research scientist at the University of Texas at Austin who studies the power grid. He noted that wind, solar and battery storage have rapidly become the “cheapest way to put more energy on the grid.”
“They’re victims of their own success,” he told Stateline. “They are relatively new players to the market, so there’s going to be pushback from incumbents.”
 Opposing sides

At the center of the current debate in Texas is state Sen. Lois Kolkhorst, a Republican committee chair who has resurrected a 2023 bill that would require new utility-scale solar and wind projects to get permits from the state’s Public Utility Commission, regulations that aren’t imposed on projects for natural gas and other energy sources. The bill also calls for set-back requirements and cleanup funds.










The land isn’t just a piece of property to us. It’s our home, our sanctuary and a big part of who we are.


– Laurie Dihle, who lives on 154 acres in Franklin County, Texas


Kolkhorst, in a statement to Stateline, called the legislation “a common-sense approach to the encroachment of wind and solar facilities being scattered across our great state with no consideration or safeguards for landowners or the environment.”
At an hourslong Senate committee hearing recently where opponents of Kolkhorst’s bill outnumbered supporters, farmers, ranchers and small-town Texans sometimes found themselves on opposite sides, either arguing that sprawling wind farms and solar arrays are a lasting source of economic vitality or a threat to a beloved way of life.
“The land isn’t just a piece of property to us,” said Laurie Dihle, who lives on 154 acres in Franklin County with her husband. “It’s our home, our sanctuary and a big part of who we are. When we look out across the road, we see rolling green pastures and trees. Now we’re facing the possibility of that view and so much more being replaced by a sprawling solar farm.”
Environmentalists and industry representatives view Kolkhorst’s bill as a roadblock in the march toward green energy. Luke Metzger, executive director of Environment Texas, said the bill would open the door to “a really arbitrary discriminatory permitting regime,” requiring wind and solar developers to get permits that other energy producers do not have to have.
Describing herself as a “lifelong wildlife conservationist,” Kolkhorst said she introduced the bipartisan bill with nine other senators in an effort that “looks past the billions in wind and solar subsidies to instead focus on the total impact of these projects on our land, people and wildlife.”
But oil and gas projects also can harm wildlife, and scientists note that the emissions released by fossil fuels worsen climate change disasters.
Blue states hope their clean energy plans withstand collision with Trump

Insiders following the legislation, including Metzger, identify one of the bill’s major supporters as Kolkhorst donor Dan Friedkin, a billionaire Houston businessman.
Friedkin, chairman emeritus of the Texas Parks and Wildlife Commission, is owner and CEO of The Friedkin Group, a consortium of businesses and investments that includes Gulf States Toyota. Gulf States is one of the world’s largest distributors of Toyota vehicles and parts, with exclusive rights to sell Toyotas in Texas and four other states. Gulf States Toyota Inc. State PAC made four donations totaling $42,500 to Kolkhorst from October of 2020 to October of 2024, according to the Texas Ethics Commission.
Friedkin is a stunt pilot and outdoorsman with a ranch in South Texas. Neither he nor his lobbyist, Laird Doran, senior vice president for public and legal affairs at The Friedkin Group, returned phone calls from Stateline.
Texas lawmakers have filed dozens of wind- and solar-related bills this session, including measures aimed at restricting the placement of battery storage facilities, curbing tax breaks and subsidies for renewable companies and limiting the amount of electricity solar and wind projects contribute to the state’s power grid.
Republican state Sen. Phil King, for example, is pushing a bill that would mandate that 50% of all new electricity must come from natural gas, nuclear or battery storage. King said solar and wind power should be part of the state’s energy mix, but he claims they aren’t reliable enough to serve as the foundation.
State Rep. Don McLaughlin, a Republican, has introduced legislation mandating a study of the economic impact of wind and solar projects on local communities, as well as noise and health effects, threats to wildlife and the challenges of disassembling worn-out systems. Sweetwater, Texas, has thousands of composite blades piled up in “a windmill graveyard.”
 Rural support

But many rural GOP lawmakers whose districts long ago sprouted oil rigs and pump jacks are now strong supporters of wind and solar power.
“It’s nonstop windmills on both side of the road for 70 miles,” said state Rep. John Smithee of Amarillo, describing a typical drive from his hometown in the Texas Panhandle to the Capitol in Austin. “Almost all of those [constituents] have benefited.”
Solar energy and its cheaper bills are coming to more disadvantaged communities

State Rep. Drew Darby, whose northwest Texas district includes San Angelo and Water Valley, an unincorporated community of around 300, said revenue from wind power has resulted in countywide improvements and lease payments to property owners.
“It’s been a positive impact on rural effectiveness,” said Darby. “Landowners … are receiving nice payments for leasing the property.”
In Water Valley, taxes from the increased revenue paved the way for a tax-free bond election that enabled the town’s K-12 school to add an upscale weight room, a technical educational facility and a “cafetorium” that serves as a dining room and performance hall. The school building had previously been so small that students had to eat in shifts.
The wind farm is expected to generate $123 million in local taxes over the 30-year life of the project, as well as more than $100 million in payments to landowners.
George Neill, the West Texas rancher, said he takes the wind turbines in stride as he roams across his 1,700-acre spread.
He’s not at liberty to reveal the amount of his payments. He’s not getting rich, he said, but the money “makes a difference when you’re trying run a ranch.”

While rural hospitals serve as the frontline of care for their communities, they depend on our urban medical centers for advanced specialty care, training and research. This collaboration ensures that patients statewide have access to vital local care backed by nation-leading facilities and specialists.
Over the past two decades, the University of Nebraska Medical Center has strategically expanded its rural initiatives through medical education, research and clinical care in partnership with Nebraska Medicine.
This includes innovative facilities like the Davis Global Center, with world-class clinical simulation training and the Fred & Pamela Buffett Cancer Center, which advances life-saving research and treatment. These institutions have revolutionized training and care for infectious disease, cardiovascular disease and cancer.
Now, UNMC is taking its next step forward with Project Health, a landmark public-private partnership that will have a transformative impact on Nebraska.
This project, the largest to date for the University of Nebraska System, will create a new $2.19 billion health care facility at UNMC and Nebraska Medicine that will serve as a clinical learning center to educate and train the next generation of health care providers.
Biomedical scientists will conduct world-class medical research and provide clinical trials to hone prevention and treatment methods for all Nebraskans and beyond.
Our state has tremendous needs when it comes to healthcare. Many counties in western and central Nebraska have no or few primary care physicians. And projections show that Nebraska will experience a workforce shortage of over 5,000 nurses this year
alone. It’s vital for Nebraska to have a robust long-term training pipeline for doctors, nurses and other health professionals, and Project Health addresses that need.
Project Health will expand enrollment across UNMC’s educational programs to meet workforce demands. It also will notably support UNMC’s partnership with the University of Nebraska at Kearney Health Sciences Education Complex, where over 300 nursing,
allied health and public health students soon will train alongside medical students and physicians at the new Rural Health Education Building.
Additionally, Project Health will expand rural clinical rotations and medical education, ensuring that health professionals are prepared in rural hospitals and clinics — a key indicator of a physician practicing in a rural community after their residency training.
Over the course of Project Health’s construction through 2033, Nebraska will see a projected economic impact of $3.2 billion. Once complete, the initiative’s annual contribution to Nebraska’s economy is expected to exceed $1.5 billion.
Project Health is the first step of several within a larger initiative — Project NExT, short for Nebraska Transformation. In 2020, our Legislature voted to support Project NExT to address Nebraska’s healthcare workforce shortage. Now, the University of Nebraska is ready to move forward with key steps to bring this vision into reality.
For a transformative project of this scale, public and private support are vital. Project Health is supported through a partnership that includes funding from state appropriations, private philanthropy, local government support and institutional investments. This wide-ranging support shows broad consensus for strengthening Nebraska’s future healthcare capability.
By supporting the state’s investment in Project Health, the Unicameral helps ensure that Nebraskans, no matter where they live, have access to high-quality, affordable care.
Project Health is the first step, but the vision for Project NExT is much broader — it will create a thriving and ever-changing workforce pipeline that meets the evolving needs of our state.
Project Health serves multiple statewide goals — as a commitment to the well-being of Nebraskans, a driver of economic development and an investment returning benefits to the state for generations. After all, strong rural health makes for a strong rural
Nebraska, ensuring communities remain vibrant and sustainable. UNMC is ready to move forward with next steps, in a spirit of innovation and dedication, to serve all of Nebraska and its healthcare needs.

Ross Williams/Georgia RecorderLawmakers in the Senate concluded the 39th legislative day of the 2025 session in the early hours of Thursday morning by advancing a bill that would ban diversity, equity and inclusion programs or policies from all state public schools and universities. 
The bill, which effectively hollowed out legislation originally aimed at increasing sick days and maternity leave for public school teachers, passed in a contentious 33-21 vote, restricting the freedom educational institutions have to discuss racial justice issues even as lawmakers across the hall voted to expand First Amendment protections based on religion only hours before.
House Bill 127’s sponsor in the Senate, Sylvania Republican Sen. Max Burns, argued that the bill was aimed at preventing discrimination in Georgia’s public educational institutions.
“DEI is the antithesis of equality,” Burns said on the Senate floor. “If you believe in equality, if you believe in equal opportunity, this bill does not strip you of that. It enhances it.”
Democrats swiftly condemned the bill, arguing that a ban on DEI would be a return to an era of “state-sponsored discrimination.” They also feared it could be used to censor topics like slavery’s role in the civil war and other ways that race and racism have shaped American history.
“I don’t want to say DEI, I want to talk about diversity, equity and inclusion,” said Derek Mallow, a Savannah Democrat. “If there is a need to ban DEI, then what is the opposite to diversity? Well the opposite to diversity is uniformity, and to be uniform means that you lack any other options for anyone to be different, to look different, to talk different, to walk different, to be different.”
They also proposed a total of 20 amendments — the most on any individual bill in living memory — but all 20 amendments were dismissed without a vote by Lt. Gov. Burt Jones. 
“This is a sad day for the Georgia state Senate, one of the saddest I’ve ever been in in 10 years, quite frankly,” said Senate Minority Leader Harold Jones II, an Augusta Democrat. 
“This doesn’t represent the people of Georgia,” he continued. “Tonight was a night the Republican Party said they’re going to take Georgia backwards — backwards to days when people did not have full rights.”
The bill now returns to the House, which must agree to the Senate’s amendments before the bill can advance to the governor’s desk.

Ross Williams/Georgia RecorderOn the penultimate day of the 2025 legislative session, some religious Georgians had their prayers answered.
A so-called religious freedom bill is on Gov. Brian Kemp’s desk after the House approved it 96-70 along mostly party lines late Wednesday night.
A Georgia religious freedom restoration act, or RFRA bill, has been a goal of the Georgia GOP since shortly after the U.S. Supreme Court legalized gay marriage in 2015.
Senate Bill 36 by Acworth Republican Sen. Ed Setzler places restrictions on state and local governments’ ability to “substantially burden a person’s exercise of religion” unless it is “in furtherance of a compelling governmental interest” and even then only if they use the “least restrictive means of furthering such compelling governmental interest.”
Cedartown Republican Rep. Trey Kelley said that means religious Georgians will have their rights protected from state and local governments the same way they are protected from the federal government under the First Amendment. A federal version passed in 1993.
“What this measure simply looks to do is codify the same balancing test for our exercise of religious freedom that the other four First Amendment rights have,” he said. “This should be something that we can agree to. We got a lot we can fight about. This should be something we can agree to.”
Democrats largely disagreed.
  Rep. Ruwa Romman argues against the RFRA bill. Ross Williams/Georgia
Opponents like Duluth Democratic Rep. Ruwa Romman say the bill would amount to a license to discriminate against those religious minorities and LGBTQ Georgians.
“I think a lot about what if a Muslim woman who wears a headscarf is in a workplace and her boss decides to fire her because it offends his faith?” said Romman, who is Muslim. “What if, for example, somebody is praying, takes five minutes to pray during the day, and their boss says, ‘you know what, you don’t believe in Jesus Christ as your Lord and Savior and I’m going to fire you. It is my business, I should be able to do that.’ And to some extent, there are already allowances for that to begin with. To me, the negatives far outweigh any potential benefits”
Democrats attempted to add an amendment to the effect that the law could not be used to discriminate but Republicans rejected it.
The state’s only currently-serving Jewish lawmaker, Sandy Springs Democratic Rep. Esther Panitch, said the law could allow discrimination against Jews if it came from a sincere religious belief.

Panitch said determining the motivation of antisemitic acts would mean more work for courts.
“Each case will require an extensive analysis of whether antisemitic expression is truly motivated by sincere religious beliefs,” she said. “The result is that secular antisemitism faces consequences while religiously motivated antisemitism receives protections.”
Both Romman and Panitch predicted RFRA could mean religious carveouts to the state’s abortion law. Panitch said Jews believe life begins at birth rather than at conception as state law says, and Romman said Islam prioritizes saving the life of a mother and the RFRA bill would make it impossible to live out that mandate.
Avondale Estates Democratic Rep. Karla Drenner, who became the Legislature’s first openly-LGBTQ member when she took office in 2001, read from the speech she read opposing a RFRA bill in 2016.
“I must note that the irony of debating the bill that licenses prejudice against my community in the city too busy to hate is not lost on me,” she said. “I oppose – back then it was House Bill 757, today it’s Senate Bill 36 – I oppose it for any number of reasons. It says that my rights under the constitution, under the law and under God are not inalienable but rather are subject to the opinions of others.”
In a surprise move, Republican Gov. Nathan Deal vetoed that year’s RFRA bill.

Drenner also took a swipe at a slate of red meat bills she suggested were signs of weakness in the GOP.
“This year, we have let the other chamber that’s running for governor run our chamber over here, from my perspective,” she said. “We’ve done all these terrible bills, from my perspective.”
Republican representatives took the opposite view.
“I got a little frustrated over there when I was listening, this is dealing with government burdening the free exercise of religion in this state,” said Bremen Republican Rep. Tyler Paul Smith. “This is not a license for a private citizen to use this against another private citizen.”
Dawsonville Republican Rep. Will Wade said the measure will reaffirm Georgians’ bedrock religious freedoms.
“Senate Bill 36 simply gives people of all faiths, all faiths, their day in court if they believe the government has overreached,” he said. “Over half of the states – we’ve heard it today, 39 now, we can be the 40th – It is time that Georgia provide the same safeguards that 39 other states in our country have for their citizens. We are a state very rich in diversity, I think that’s what makes it better.”
Kemp has 40 days from Friday to sign, and has indicated he will do so.
“I want to congratulate those who worked for the passage of SB 36,” he said in a statement. “I have always maintained that I would support and sign a version of RFRA which mirrors the language and protections provided by federal law since 1993. My commitment to that promise and to the deeply held beliefs of Georgians of faith remains unwavering. I also want to assure those of differing views that Georgia remains a welcoming place to live, work, and raise a family.“

John McCosh/Georgia RecorderA late-emerging proposal in the Georgia Legislature would limit what the public can access in police reports and communications with state lawmakers.
The proposed changes to Georgia’s Open Records Act were tacked onto another bill, Senate Bill 12, late in the day Wednesday in the gatekeeping House Rules Committee, bypassing the usual legislative committee process and shortcutting public debate on the measure. 
Under the new proposal, police departments would be able to shield almost all information about officers’ stops, arrests and incident responses, says Sarah Brewerton-Palmer, executive director with the Georgia First Amendment Foundation.
Additionally, the bill would create broad new exemptions to prevent public disclosure of the General Assembly’s activities, including communication with other parts of state government, she said. 
Lawmakers are already largely exempted from the Open Records Act, but the proposal would go further in restricting access, adding records and data prepared for legislators to the list of off-limits information to the public. 
“This is no time to weaken Georgia’s transparency laws, and it would be particularly inappropriate to do so this way — by tacking lengthy amendments onto a bill in the final days of the session, with no opportunity for public comment,” Brewerton-Palmer said.
The bill was changed and advanced out of the House Rules Committee meeting over the objections of Democrats who questioned the sudden urgency and raised concerns about how broad the proposed changes are. 
“I’m a little bit concerned that nobody knows where this came from, and what is the urgency that brings us here on the 39th day at this hour?” said House Minority Leader Carolyn Hugley of Columbus during the 7 p.m. meeting.
Rep. Rob Leverett, an Elberton Republican, described the changes as meant to “clean up” aspects of Georgia’s Open Records Act while there was a related bill on the move. The original bill had aimed to clarify that records requests should be filed with government agencies that created the need for the record and not private contractors or vendors – a response to a Georgia Supreme Court ruling last fall. 
The bill was quickly sent back to the House Rules Committee but remains in play for Friday, which is the last day of the 2025 legislative session.

Ross Williams/Georgia Recorder (file)A pair of election bills the Georgia Senate passed Wednesday propose new State Election Board powers, remove Georgia from multi-state voter rolls sharing databases and allow voters to request hand-marked paper ballots.
The Senate voted along party lines Wednesday for the sweeping voting rules changes proposed in House Bill 397 as well as Senate Bill 214, which aims to encourage voters to use pencils or pens to complete ballots instead of electronic voting machines as is the primary option now.
Sen. Jason Esteves, an Atlanta Democrat, criticized plans in the bill sponsored by Rep. Tim Fleming, a Covington Republican, that would force the state to withdraw from the Electronic Registration Information Center (ERIC), a system that backers including Republican Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger contend helps Georgia maintain more accurate voter rolls by sharing voter data across multiple states.
The Fleming bill would need a final House vote by Friday to clear both chambers.
Esteves said a new system of multiple bilateral agreements to replace ERIC would be much more expensive and inefficient than the status quo.
Republican lawmakers argue the state should withdraw from a third-party system that could lead to voter privacy concerns.
Some Democratic members of the House have voiced opposition to a bill restricting counties from accepting hand-delivered absentee ballots on the weekend before an election, arguing that this could prevent college students and military personnel from voting.
Duluth Democratic Sen. Nabilah Islam Parkes slammed the bill for not securing  elections but instead sabotaging them by “sewing distress, empowering conspiracy theorists, and silencing the voices of everyday Georgians.”
“Why are we tossing out a system that works and replacing it with political theater? she said. “HB 397 makes it harder, again, for folks to vote by mail.”
There are also several provisions in the bill aimed at expanding the power of the State Election Board, which has been under fire for its rulemaking in the run-up to the general election in 2024.
The bill would place the election board under the administration of the state accounting office instead of the secretary of state’s office.
State election officials would also have access to all state investigative reports and communications between the secretary of state and the local election superintendents. The bill would also spell out State Election Board rulemaking powers with proposed year-round authority to adopt election rules so long as they don’t take effect within 60 days of an election, according to the legislation.
Cumming Republican Sen. Dolezal rejected claims the legislation as the latest Republican voter suppression effort.
Dolezal said the increased minority voter participation since the passage of the Senate Bill 202 election law overhaul in 2021 demonstrates the law does not discourage minority voting.
“This bill in front of us here deals with processes by which we review who has moved out of the state,” Dolezal said. “We go through the tabulation process and when the election board is going to post information.
“Bringing up this debunked notion that was floated first by Stacey Abrams and then floated by Joe Biden and used to weaponize Major League Baseball to leave the state for a state who has very similar voting laws that we have, was ridiculous then is ridiculous today,” Dolezal said
Last week, Republican legislators advanced lHB 397 out of the Senate Ethics Committee, after making some last-minute changes were made that its sponsors said should alleviate some concerns heard during public meetings.
The current version of the bill no longer includes new mandates for requiring local election officials to hand count ballots as voting precincts are closing down for Election Day. It no longer includes a provision that would have allowed the State Election Board to hear appeals to a controversial mass voter challenge after complaints are settled by county election boards.
Paper ballots expansion spurs debate
Sylvania Republican Sen. Max Burns defended his Senate Bill 214 hand marked ballot measure as being significantly less costly than the projected $66 million needed to upgrade the current electronic voting system.
Burns said the legislation gives Georgians casting ballots during early voting and election days the option of paper ballots or the electronic touchscreen system that’s been used for statewide elections since 2020.
Burns said Wednesday that the cost of acquiring new scanners and implementing the new system is estimated to be less than half that of enhancing the current system.
Under the new legislation, the state would be required to use new voting equipment that features optical scanning systems for scanning and tabulating hand-marked paper ballots.
The new process would allow voters to request ballots similar to absentee ballots when they visit a polling place during early voting or on an Election. Day.
“The ballot itself is marked by the individual voter,” Burns said. “The voter uses a hand marking device, often called the pen, that marks the ballot that they can read. There is no QR code. They take that hand-marked  paper ballot and they submit it to a scanner, a tabulator that senses the mark on the ballot.”
Sen. Sally Harrell, an Atlanta Democrat, cautioned against expressed hesitation in rushing through a significant change in the state’s election system at this late stage in the legislative process, which could result in further financial mismanagement. Friday is the last day of the 2025 Georgia General Assembly.
Harrell wondered aloud why Republican senators rejected her amendment proposing hand-marked paper ballots when lawmakers voted in 2019 to switch to an electronic voting system.
The state has spent more than $107 million on the Dominion Voting Systems that’s been used in statewide elections since 2020.
Harrell requested more information regarding the costs associated with implementing Burns’ new ballot plan while the state is still under a 20-year contract to pay off the Dominion machines until 2040.
Currently, President Donald Trump’s administration is advocating a major overhaul of elections, including guidance advising states  against using barcodes or QR codes to tabulate votes.
“I have some of the same concerns (Esteves) raised about things coming from the federal government about what we can and can’t do over and over again,” Harrell said. “We are deciding to spend money on certain types of machines that we aren’t going to use long enough to justify the expenses. We made that mistake in 2019 and we’re making that same mistake now.”

Scott Perry (R-10th) addresses supporters in the early hours of Nov. 6 as his race had yet to be called. (Photo by Ben Wasserstein for the Capital-Star)As Republicans face increasingly critical crowds in town halls or avoid them altogether, Rep. Scott Perry (R-10) held a telephone town hall to answer constituents’ questions.
Perry’s event came a week after a Democratic state Senate candidate won a special election in a Trump+15 District in Lancaster County, not far from his own congressional district. And on Tuesday, a liberal candidate for Wisconsin’s state Supreme Court beat a conservative opponent. It was  a race widely seen as a referendum on Trump’s agenda, and in particular the role of billionaire megadonor Elon Musk, who poured millions into the contest.
Perry expressed both praise and skepticism of Musk and his role as the figurehead of the Department of Government Efficiency, which has led the Trump administration’s efforts to slash tens of thousands of federal jobs and cancel contracts across federal agencies – usually without warning. 
The Republican lawmaker also answered questions on the sweeping tariffs announced by President Donald Trump earlier in the day, efforts to thwart federal judges who have blocked parts of Trump’s agenda, and concerns that Republicans will cut programs like Medicare and Social Security.
The town hall came after weeks of demands for Perry to communicate directly with constituents. He faced some tough questions, but not the rowdy crowds that met other Republicans who held events in person.
As Trump came into office and quickly began slashing federal spending and cutting tens of thousands of jobs, voters in the 10th Congressional District demanded their representative’s ear. Beginning in February, there were protests outside of his district offices. And last month, labor leaders and other advocates held a town hall in his absence at the American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees Conference Center in Swatara Township, Dauphin County, that drew around 150 constituents.

Praise and skepticism of Elon Musk
Multiple callers asked Perry about Musk, who has become one of the most prominent and controversial figures in the Trump administration’s orbit.
Perry, who has echoed many of Musk’s claims of fraud and waste on social media, expressed both praise and skepticism of the entrepreneur-turned-presidential advisor. 
Ultimately, he said that it’s been a source of “frustration” that Musk’s Department of Government Efficiency has not been more transparent about their claims that their sweeping cuts have saved tens of billions of dollars.
His statement was in response to a question about why lawmakers had to raise the debt ceiling, despite Musk’s claimed spending cuts.
“I will tell you, I have a personal frustration,  and we have asked, ‘Let’s see the details on DOGE,’” Perry said. “We can’t see granularly at this point. I know there’s a website and it says, ‘We have eliminated this contract’ or ‘We have eliminated this spending.’ But we have to put that in a frame of reference in the appropriations bill to see where that came from.”
Musk’s DOGE has come under fire practically since it started operating, in part because of false or exaggerated claims of savings. Following media fact checks, the New York Times reported that DOGE made changes to its website which made it harder to independently verify claims of savings. 
Though that has not stopped Perry from sharing Musk’s unverified claims of finding fraud on social media. 
But, he also praised DOGE, and their work identifying inefficiencies in the government’s record-keeping systems. Perry noted those systems are too numerous and struggle to communicate with one another, opening them up to fraud. He also said that he’d like to see DOGE operatives look at how to cut spending in the Medicare and Medicaid programs
“Washington’s been on a reckless spending spree for way too long,” Perry claimed at the top of the call. “That’s why we have to codify many of the cuts proposed under the Department of Government Efficiency, ensuring that we actually reduce the waste and reign in the federal overreach once and for all. Quite honestly, the waste is simply breathtaking.”

Support for Trump’s Tariffs
Earlier on Wednesday, Trump unveiled his long-promised plan to place tariffs, which will affect more than 100 nations and trading partners.
Asked for his thoughts on the issue, Perry was generally supportive. Though he noted he had not had advanced notice of the details of the tariff plans and was still reviewing them. He also said that he would like to see exemptions for products like coffee and cocoa that generally can not be grown the U.S.
Since Trump promised to announce the sweeping tariffs on Wednesday, U.S. and foreign markets fell. Prices on a broad range of products are also expected to rise, and consumer confidence reached a four-year low.
Yet the hope for tariff supporters is that the move will bolster the consumption of American made products, and incite companies to move manufacturing into the U.S. – instead of importing products produced with cheaper labor elsewhere.
“I know there’s going to be some market adjustments, but I also know that prior to the national income tax, our country was basically funded by tariffs,” Perry said.  
While tariffs were a primary source of income for the United States for decades, they were largely phased out following World War II, the introduction of income tax, and the increase of global trade.

Constituents express fears of cuts to social programs
Multiple people asked Perry about whether there will be cuts to benefit programs like Medicaid and Social Security.
All but one House Republican voted in February on a broad outline of a plan that would cut $2 trillion in federal spending. Perry was quick to point out that the fine points of how that spending will be cut haven’t been worked out.
“That’s what we call the top line, and these are the targets to get to,” Perry said.
Democrats have warned that the only way to make those cuts possible would be by eating into the funding of social programs. But, Perry noted that Senate Republicans were not likely to agree to such large cuts, and that they would ultimately have to compromise. 
The congressman acknowledged that, in order to reduce the deficit, lawmakers will have to take a hard look at these programs.  He expressed optimism that cuts could be made by eliminating alleged fraud.
“There’s fraud and abuse and that and improper payments,” Perry said about Social Security. “We’re finding out that people have abused these systems to the tune of hundreds of millions, and maybe billions and billions, of dollars. We can’t continue down that road. At a minimum, we should make sure that that stuff is stopped, so that the people that have paid in can get out what they’re expecting.”
A recent audit of the Social Security program found billions in improper payments between 2020 and 2023, but those makes up a small fraction — less than 1% — of all payments made by the multi-trillion dollar program. And not all of those overpayments were due to fraud. 
Perry also said he’d be open to making fewer Americans eligible for Medicaid.
“Working adults have become the largest subgroup of Medicaid because of the way it’s been expanded,” Perry said. “The real problem … is that we can’t afford it, because we have just a huge amount of spending where we never had it before … It wasn’t what it was designed for.”
Medicaid was vastly expanded under the 2010 Affordable Care Act. Since then, virtually all American citizens who haven’t aged into Medicare, and can’t obtain comparable insurance through an employer or spouse, can get on a federally-funded plan. Though what the government’s share of that cost is depends on a recipient’s income.
“The expanded population is 90% of [what the] federal government is paying, and so it’s actually diverting the resources away from the truly needy people,” Perry said. “We’ve got to take a look at it to make sure that the eligibility requirements are being met for the truly needy”
Another constituent asked about the impact of cuts to the Social Security Administration’s workforce, and whether it would make it more difficult to access services. 
Perry said while people may be experiencing difficulty getting a golf of Social Security employees since workforce cuts to federal agencies, the issue isn’t new. 
“I’m not for cutting the staff if the staff is necessary,” Perry said.  “But we’ve dealt for a long time with Social Security in our office, because people could not get timely answers. And unfortunately for us, that’s not a new circumstance.”
“I don’t know if it’s becoming more acute,” Perry added.

“Activist judges”
Perry was asked by a Trump-supporting constituent what he hoped to do about judges that have blocked some of the administration’s policies from taking effect. That includes his ban on birthright citizenship, his efforts to strip deportation protections from Venezuelans, and blocking federal funding for institutions that provide gender-affirming care for youth.
“We have these activist judges just right and left impeding him every step they go,” the caller said. “Why isn’t funding being pulled?”
Injunctions with nationwide effects ordered by federal judges have drawn the ire of numerous Republicans lawmakers. Speaker of the House Mike Johnson (R-Louisiana), has warned that lawmakers may take action, including defunding or restructuring federal courts.
Perry, however, took a more measured approach. 
“We do control the power of the purse, but I don’t know that there really is any way to single out individual judges,” Perry said. “We would be essentially forced to cut the entire portion of some judiciary and I don’t think that’s probably responsible when there’s one or two bad actors.”
Perry also said he does not believe impeachment is wise. He said it could “bog down” Congress, and would almost certainly fail in the Senate where a two-thirds vote is required. 
But Perry was asked specifically about a resolution introduced by Arizona Republican Rep. Andy Biggs, which contends that judges can be removed with a simple majority vote by taking advantage of a constitutional loophole. 
The Constitution states that judges “shall hold their offices during good behavior,” and Biggs’ resolution argues that Judge James E. Boasberg, who attempted to block Trump from deporting hundreds of alleged gang members to El Salvador, has violated it. Though it would likely face legal challenges, the resolution is an effort to skirt the two-thirds vote requirement of impeachment.
Perry warned against the tact.
“There’s oftentimes activism on both sides,” Perry said. “When Republicans are in the Executive branch, then there might be activists on the Democrat side, and vice versa. So you’ve gotta understand that things cut both ways.”",https://penncapital-star.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Perry-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-04-03 00:01:14.560322

He recently appeared at a press conference to support a formula for the wrongfully incarcerated to get compensation for lost years. Ross Williams/Georgia RecorderThe Georgia House passed a bill Wednesday that seeks to overhaul the compensation process allowing the state to pay wrongfully convicted Georgians, a system that has long relied on individual resolutions to pay people who were locked up and later exonerated.
Republican lawmakers in the state House prevailed in a contentious 244-61 vote after legislators spliced it onto a bill aimed at allowing criminal defendants to recoup their legal costs if the prosecuting attorney in their case is disqualified for personal or professional misconduct. 
The original wrongful compensation bill, House Bill 533, stalled in the House on Crossover Day, March 7, passing out of the chamber’s Judiciary Non-Civil Committee but never appearing on the floor for a vote. Previous versions of the bill have faced fierce opposition in the Senate, particularly by Sen. Randy Robertson, a Cataula

Republican and former law enforcement officer who has repeatedly raised questions about the innocence of convicts who he says could be exonerated by the courts on a legal technicality. But attached to Senate Bill 244, which the bill’s lead sponsor Sen. Brandon Beach said is inspired by President Donald Trump’s election interference case in Georgia, it may face a smoother path to success.
The Genesis of the Wrongful Conviction Compensation Act
As one of only a few states without a designated statute in place to compensate wrongfully convicted citizens, Georgia’s wrongfully incarcerated residents face an uphill battle when attempting to secure compensation.
That’s on top of the already complex, often yearslong process prisoners must undertake in order to get a conviction overturned. Once they’ve secured their freedom, those who have been wrongfully convicted must then find a state representative who is willing to sponsor an individual compensation resolution for them and file a claim with Georgia’s Claims Advisory Board. For any claims over $5,000 — which encompasses most, if not all wrongful conviction cases — the advisory board will then make a recommendation to the legislature, which apportions compensation funds as part of the annual state budget.
“Certainly, this process is not meant for wrongful conviction,” said Maggie Hasty, who oversees claims for the Secretary of State’s office. “It is meant for people who have monetary claims against state agencies.”
Following the Advisory Board’s recommendations, those resolutions then go through the full legislative process and must pass committees and floor votes in both the House and Senate before they can take effect.
  Rep. Katie Dempsey. Ross Williams/Georgia Recorder
Advocates have criticized the current system, arguing that it results in unequal treatment between exonerees and subjects individual compensation resolutions to legislators’ political whims. But under the language in HB 533, sponsored by Rome Republican Rep. Katie Dempsey, the pathway would be streamlined. The bill would establish a new process under Georgia state law for people who have been exonerated, allowing administrative law judges — rather than the Claims Advisory Board — to rule on wrongful conviction compensation cases. It would also award a standardized rate of $75,000 for each year of incarceration to each exoneree, with an additional $25,000 added for each year spent on death row. 
For Dempsey, who sponsored two individual compensation resolutions for residents of Floyd County in addition to the Wrongful Conviction Compensation Act, “a wrongful conviction is unimaginable.” 
“I often put myself in those shoes — because it could happen to any of us, or our children, or someone we love or care about,” she said, adding, “I wouldn’t last ten minutes in prison and you all know that. I would need a lot more than money to make me whole.”
For the five citizens hoping to seek compensation this year, however, time may already have run out. On Crossover Day, lawmakers combined five individual compensation resolutions into House Resolution 128, which passed overwhelmingly in the House but did not receive a hearing on the Senate side until Tuesday, after the deadline to add it to the Senate calendar had passed. The Senate Appropriations Subcommittee on Compensation, which Robertson chairs, began its hearing at 6 a.m. on Tuesday morning, ultimately concluding after more than four hours of testimony without a final vote.
“We rush too many things through this building without having legitimate, deep-dive conversations about it,” Robertson said, comparing the combined bill to a “bastard son.”
Democrats split between aiding wrongfully convicted and President Trump
For House Democrats, who have overwhelmingly supported compensating those who are wrongfully convicted in previous bienniums, the marriage between the wrongful conviction act and a bill aimed at compensating President Donald Trump presented a philosophical dilemma.
According to state Sen. Brandon Beach, an Alpharetta Republican and staunch Trump ally who was recently appointed by the president to serve as U.S. Treasurer, SB 244 was directly inspired by Trump’s election interference case in Georgia, in which Fulton County District Attorney Fani Willis was disqualified after an appeals court judge

found that her romantic relationship with special prosecutor Nathan Wade created a “‘significant’ appearance of impropriety.” Under SB 244, attorney’s fees and other costs would come out of county prosecutors’ budgets, which Democrats fear could have a disproportionate impact on smaller counties with more limited budgets, and discourage prosecutors from tackling complex or high-profile cases.
In a scathing Minority Report, state Rep. Shea Roberts, an Atlanta Democrat, condemned the combination of the two pieces of legislation.
“I wanted to believe that we were better than this,” she said. “I held out hope that the majority party in this chamber would not use its legislative power for blatant political retribution. And tacking the Wrongfully Incarcerated Compensation bipartisan bill that our colleagues have worked tirelessly to pass for years onto this punitive SB 244 makes me physically sick.”
The bill would also directly benefit a sitting legislator: Sen. Shawn Still, a Johns Creek Republican, was indicted in the Fulton County election interference case alongside Trump and 17 other codefendants. If the bill passes, he too may be able to recoup the cost of his legal fees.
But state Rep. Scott Holcomb, an Atlanta Democrat who sponsored two previous versions of the Wrongful Conviction Compensation Act, urged his colleagues to vote in favor of the bill.
  Rep. Scott Holcomb. Ross Williams/Georgia Recorder
The current compensation process “has been candidly broken for a very, very long time,” he said. “What it leads to is inconsistent results: some people get compensation, some people don’t. Some people get a certain amount of compensation, some people get less, some people get more.”
He also highlighted the repeated issues he’s faced getting the Senate to consider any form of compensation for the wrongfully convicted.
“What’s happened since 2022 is no resolutions have moved, period, in the senate,” he said. “They haven’t entertained them, they haven’t considered them. Last year they didn’t even have hearings for measures that were passed here.”
Though the vast majority of Democrats voted against the bill, Holcomb and Dempsey are optimistic that combining the two bills will improve their chances of establishing change by the end of the 2025 legislative session.
“I don’t like being sideways with the majority of my caucus,” Holcomb said after the bill passed on the House floor. “But at the same token, when all is said and done, and when I leave this building for good, there’s going to be very few things that I’ve worked on that will have been incredibly consequential. This will be one of them, and so I had to continue to support it, and I’ll continue to support it, and I really hope that it gets to the finish line this year.”
The legislation now returns to the Senate, which must agree to the amended House version before the bill can advance to the governor’s desk.

Jim Pillen’s recommendation to cut the program’s state funding.
State Sen. Jana Hughes of Seward, through successful 2024 and 2025 legislation, mandated that the Nebraska Department of Health and Human Services identify and work with a nonprofit on such a program. The plan has been to partner with Iowa’s SafeNetRx for a first-in-the-nation multi-state prescription drug donation program. Hughes visited the facility in October 2023.

The SafeNetRx program tailors its services to individuals who can’t afford prescribed medication, regardless of insurance status, with an annual household income at or below 200% of the federal poverty level.
Nebraska state senators approved about $530,000 annually for the program in 2024, which hadn’t yet taken off because a federal law took effect last summer, tying up the partnership.
Pillen suggested pulling funding in his January budget recommendations. It was one of many recent programs on the governor’s “last in, first out” suggestions list.
‘Incredibly disappointed’
Lawmakers voted 46-0 on March 6 for a quick fix from Hughes to get around the federal obstacle, clearing the way for DHHS to act. The new state law, Legislative Bill 10, which Pillen approved five days after passage, included language from the Governor’s Office authorizing DHHS to receive and dispense donated medicines or supplies to anyone impacted by a governor-declared state of emergency.
Even with the change, SafeNetRx was left in the wings.
The Legislature’s Appropriations Committee on Wednesday, in a 6-0 vote with three senators not taking a position, voted to pull all funding.
The same lawmakers also reworded the language authorizing the spending, stipulating that DHHS officials “may” identify a nonprofit for the donation program, rather than “shall.” The vote also prohibited DHHS from using any state funds “for the purpose of approving, designating or administering the program.”
Hughes said she was “incredibly disappointed” by the language change on spending.
“I wasn’t aware that this was a discussion going on, and they made that determination, I feel, on some misinformation,” Hughes said after the vote.
Previous widespread support
State Sen. Christy Armendariz of Omaha, committee vice chair, said she had a lot of questions about the program that remained unanswered. She led the vote to take away funding, joined by State Sens. Rob Clements, Myron Dorn, Loren Lippincott and Paul Strommen, all Republicans in the officially nonpartisan Legislature.

State Sens. Ashlei Spivey, Machaela Cavanaugh and Jason Prokop, all Democrats, were “present, not voting.”
All nine committee members supported Hughes’ bill in March. The non-freshman senators supported the 2024 legislation and funding bill, as did the predecessors for freshmen Prokop, Spivey and Strommen.
Armendariz compared the medications program to when she tore down a fence and had someone take her “trash” away for free. She said if SafeNetRx wanted the medications, that was one thing, but she was uncertain what happened with the medications after, how the nonprofit was funded and whether SafeNetRx staff would be recirculating the medications for free.
“If that nonprofit is doing it for free, that’s a different answer from me,” Armendariz said.
Without state funding, Hughes said it is unlikely the Iowa-based program would just return donated medicine to Nebraska. Nebraskans can already donate to the program, which was the status quo before Hughes’ laws. At least one Nebraska pharmacy, in Gretna, was already donating meds.
How the program works
SafeNetRx has multiple inspections to check whether meds are:

Sealed in tamper-evident packaging.
Non-expired.
Non-controlled substances.

Pharmacists also confirm that donated medicines do not require refrigeration and show no signs of tampering or deterioration. To date, according to SafeNetRx, there have been zero patient safety issues.

According to SafeNetRx’s latest annual report, the “drug donation journey” is five steps: donate, process, inspect, connect with local pharmacists and “change lives.” Last fiscal year, 237 long-term care pharmacies, community pharmacies, medical clinics, public health agencies or other donors nationwide gave to the nonprofit, including from Nebraska.
Iowa’s provider network currently includes in-state primary health care clinics, free clinics or charitable pharmacies, community pharmacies, specialty care clinics, behavioral health practices and federally qualified health centers.
If the partnership goes forward, Nebraska pharmacists could be part of the provider network and have access to real-time inventory to secure necessary prescription drugs for low-income patients.
By the end of fiscal year 2024, SafeNetRx had served more than 147,000 patients with medicine they couldn’t otherwise afford, according to the annual report. In total, SafeNetRx has received $126 million in donated medicine that has been collected, inspected and made available through the dispensing network.
Budget deficit impact
Hughes’ legislation sailed through both years with little conversation. Armendariz said she asked questions off the floor, yet some “unknowns” remained.
“I didn’t think that it would be that detrimental. It wasn’t that much money,” Armendariz said of why she voted for the bills each time. “We’re in a different financial situation now.”
  State Sen. Rob Clements of Elmwood. Jan. 8, 2025. (Zach Wendling/Nebraska Examiner)
The state faces a projected $457 million projected budget deficit, with preliminary cuts proposed by the Appropriations Committee bringing that down to $289 million. 
Cutting Hughes’ program would save just over $1 million in that cycle, while also clawing back all funds from this fiscal year that DHHS didn’t spend, even after the March fix. 
Armendariz, defending her position, said she worked at the Open Door Mission in Omaha and understood the possible impact of people not having meds, pointing to people the organization helped. 
On Hughes’ bill, Armendariz said the “unknowns” led her to think it was “fair game, on the table, to reevaluate whether we wanted to continue it.”
‘Show me the numbers’
SafeNetRx CEO Jon Rosmann, in a phone call just after the vote this year to clear the way for the program, described Hughes’ bill as the “last hurdle.” He said he and his nonprofit were “pretty optimistic” for what could be the first multi-state donation program nationwide. 
SafeNetRx began in 2007 and has grown to be the largest in the nation, with bipartisan support.
Rosmann had said that for every dollar that SafeNetRx received — Iowa lawmakers this year appropriated $600,000 in state dollars — it leads to $20 in donated medicine for patients.
“There’s just not a lot of programs and services that can offer that type of return,” Rosmann said after that vote.

Dr. Joshua Rehmann, a family medicine physician in Des Moines who has been on the SafeNetRx board of directors, said in late March that his patients have benefited from the Iowa program, and he was excited about the prospects of the Cornhusker State joining in.
“The amount of money that saves for the system with hopefully fewer disease complications down the road has a huge impact,” Rehmann said.
Rosmann had said the Nebraska-Iowa partnership could be a “template” for future expansions to other states in a “comprehensive and efficient, safe program.”
SafeNetRx officials did not respond to an afternoon email seeking comment on how the withdrawn funding might impact the planned partnership.
Hughes, defending the value of the program, said it might take a couple of years before savings are fully realized in Nebraska, but she said the alternative is continuing to spend more than $700,000 per year on incinerating unused medications, some of which could go toward patients.
Armendariz said the decision isn’t final, but that she wants to see the numbers if there is really a return on investment. 
“Show me the numbers,” Armendariz said. “Most people in government do not expect to give you an ROI.”
‘Makes no sense’
State Sen. Merv Riepe of Ralston, a former hospital administrator who went to Iowa in October 2023 with Hughes to see the SafeNetRx facility, has repeatedly said the program is worthwhile. He noted that low-income patients might space out pills, cut meds in half or skip taking doses altogether to save money. Some patients, he added, choose between food or medicine.
  State Sen. Merv Riepe of Ralston. May 25, 2023. (Zach Wendling/Nebraska Examiner)
Riepe said he was disappointed in the vote and said he hopes Hughes continues fighting and said he would be honored to be a cosponsor on a new bill, if needed.
Hughes has described her “easy,” “no-brainer” legislation as her favorite bill in her three years of service. She talked with every committee member after the noon-hour vote. 
Clements said the decision could be reconsidered in the future if the committee reaches a balanced budget and has excess funding.
Riepe and Hughes said they hope funding for the donation program can be restored this year.
“It just makes no sense,” Riepe said. “I’m really disappointed that they didn’t see the merits in it.”

(Photo by James Brooks/Alaska Beacon)The Alaska Legislature has voted to allow teenagers as young as 18 to serve alcohol in the state.
On Wednesday, the Alaska House of Representatives voted 32-8 to pass Senate Bill 15, which lowers the minimum alcohol-serving age in restaurants, breweries, wineries, distilleries, resorts and similar businesses. The minimum age to serve alcohol at a bar or sell it at a package store remains 21.
A separate provision of the bill requires alcohol-serving businesses to post a sign stating that alcohol causes cancer. Another late-added section also allows members of the American Legion and Veterans of Foreign Wars to attend each other’s social clubs.
The House’s vote follows a 19-0 vote by the Alaska Senate in February and sends the bill back to the Senate for a concurrence vote. That’s typically an uncontroversial act that asks the Senate to agree with minor changes to the bill that were made in the House. 
If the Senate concurs with the House changes, the bill will go to Gov. Mike Dunleavy for final approval.
“I am hopeful for concurrence,” said Sen. Kelly Merrick, R-Eagle River and the bill’s sponsor. 
SB 15 is almost identical to House Bill 189, which passed the Legislature last year. HB 189 was one of five bills vetoed by Dunleavy because they were passed by the House after the legal end of the regular session.
“This one passed literally two minutes after midnight and was vetoed for that reason,” said Rep. Zack Fields, D-Anchorage, who carried the bill on the House floor.
Speaking before Wednesday’s vote, Fields called SB 15 a “jobs bill” that will help employers hire for Alaska’s busy summer tourist season.
Rep. Alyse Galvin, I-Anchorage, spoke in favor of the bill. She worked as a waitress while growing up in Anchorage, and as a teenager, she earned half of what her older coworkers did because she couldn’t serve alcohol, she said.
“I was living on my own, paying my own way through college, and I was at Simon and Seafort’s and many of the restaurants that you all are familiar with, and because I couldn’t serve alcohol, I made much less money, and so I think this gives those of us who are trying to make it on their own an opportunity to make money and also get good training and supervision about how to be safe while serving,” she said.
Rep. Andrew Gray, D-Anchorage, has advocated the cancer-warning section of the bill for three years and spoke in support of that segment.
“This bill is not telling anyone what they should or shouldn’t do. It’s simply informing Alaskans about a medical fact long established, the simple way to lower your risk of cancer is to choose not to drink alcohol,” he said.
None of the bill’s opponents spoke against the bill before the final vote.
Rep. Sarah Vance, R-Homer, voted in favor of the bill last year but was among the eight “no” votes in the House this year.
Vance said that after thinking about the bill over the past few days, she supports the current over-21 drinking age and doesn’t think it makes sense to tell Alaskans that they can serve alcohol but not drink it. 
“It felt like we’re putting a moral juxtaposition for those in that age range, and it’s just not fair,” Vance said.

(Joshua Haiar/South Dakota Searchlight)PIERRE — Prosecutors played a recording Wednesday of a defendant allegedly confessing to the theft of $1.8 million from the state of South Dakota.
“I stole some money,” Lonna Carroll said while audibly crying in the recording.
Meanwhile, her defense attorney continued to say the state was negligent in its oversight and the case is too old to prosecute.
Wednesday was the second day of a trial expected to last three days at the Hughes County Courthouse. The state continued to present its case, after Tuesday’s opening statements and jury selection.

Carroll, a 68-year-old retiree, is charged with two felony counts of grand theft for crimes she allegedly committed from 2010 to 2023 while working as an administrative assistant for the Division of Child Protection Services in the state Department of Social Services. She faces up to 25 years in prison and a $50,000 fine for the first count, and 15 years in prison and a $30,000 fine for the second count.
Once a child is placed in the state’s care, Child Protection Services employees can make financial requests on the child’s behalf for items such as school supplies, clothing or a bed. The funds are deposited into a bank account for the child. 
The prosecution alleges Carroll made requests for children that were no longer in the state’s care, approved the requests, deposited checks into accounts for the children at American Bank and Trust in Pierre, and later withdrew the deposited amounts in cash. Carroll allegedly did that 215 times, stealing a total of $1,777,665.73 over the course of 13 years. 
The audio recording played for jurors included state Division of Criminal Investigation agent Charles Swanson walking Carroll through some evidence illustrating her involvement in the case. 
She verbally admitted to depositing checks at American Bank and Trust and withdrawing the funds in cash, and answered yes when asked if the situation spiraled out of control. 
The case is part of a rash of criminal allegations against state employees that state Attorney General Marty Jackley has filed since last year, leading not only to criminal prosecutions but also to a series of administrative and legislative reforms adopted in response.
Evidence shows spending on clothing, big cash deposits
Division of Criminal Investigation agent Matt Glenn led the investigation of Carroll after Department of Social Services staff contacted him on Feb. 26, 2024. A department employee had noticed discrepancies between spreadsheets and the balances in accounts that were managed by Carroll, who by that time had retired and moved to Algona, Iowa.
During Glenn’s testimony, the prosecution presented evidence that Carroll had been spending thousands on clothing. The evidence included photos of storage unit 56 at Capital Storage in Pierre. Carroll’s Wells Fargo bank statements showed she had been paying for the unit. 
The unit was “full of totes and garbage bags full of clothes and other personal items,” Glenn said, including boxes of receipts. 
$1.8 million theft trial begins with details of alleged scheme; defense attacks state negligence

Those receipts showed thousands of dollars spent on clothing, mostly in cash. One receipt showed $1,000 in cash spent at Al’s Oasis in Oacoma on clothing. 
“It was clear she was living outside her means,” Glenn said. 
Eric Grover, who identified as a coworker and friend of Carroll’s, said during his testimony that a local boutique knew her “and they would give her a call when they would get new shipments in.” 
Carroll’s court-appointed attorney Timothy Whalen asked Glenn if the statute of limitations — a time limit on the prosecution of crimes — was considered in his investigation. Glenn replied that “the clock starts” when the crime is first reported.
Whalen has frequently objected to the admittance of evidence during the trial, arguing unsuccessfully that the charges were brought after the statute of limitations expired.
April Pontrelli works in the Attorney General’s Office as an intelligence analyst looking into white collar crimes, typically fraud. She conducted an analysis of Carroll’s personal Wells Fargo bank account, which showed cash deposits from 2010 to 2023 totaling $682,900.30. 
The cash depositing peaked in 2016 when she deposited $79,815.13 — more than three times her annual take-home pay. The analysis showed she spent $48,000 on retail goods that year.
The analysis also showed she was leasing three vehicles by 2020 and had multiple apartments.
Defense questions state oversight
The Department of Social Services was audited while Carroll worked there. The department has an annual budget of $1.8 billion and more than 1,500 full-time positions.
Kelly Mikkelsen with the state Department of Legislative Audit testified that sample batches are used to audit state departments. He said those samples did not necessarily include accounts Carroll allegedly stole from.  
Exhibits showed during his testimony that Carroll made and approved initial requests as low as $1,500 that eventually reached over $27,000. She would then deposit those sums as separate checks into accounts, and withdraw the money soon after.
Legislative Audit’s investigation indicated Carroll’s involvement in the theft of $591,305.20 from 2019 to 2022 alone. Those years were separated out because the transactions included the entire paper trail — from Carroll making and approving requests, to bank statements, slips and receipts for the cash she withdrew.
“Something that should have raised an eyebrow with somebody, wouldn’t you agree?” Whalen said. 
He asked Mikkelsen why internal controls to catch such behavior were not in place.
“I think those were circumvented by Lonna Carroll,” Mikkelsen said. “There’s always another angle. There’s always a way to circumvent them.” 
The prosecution is expected to rest its case Thursday, after which the defense will have a chance to present its case.

Justin Sparks, a Republican from Wildwood, speaks March 24 during debate in the Missouri House. (Tim Bommel/Missouri House Communications)(A Missouri House member violated a state disclosure law by voting on an appropriation that helped his employer, according to a report approved unanimously on Wednesday by the House Ethics Committee.
The committee, made up of five Republicans and five Democrats, was investigating a complaint against state Rep. Justin Sparks, a Republican from Wildwood, related to his employment with the National Law Enforcement Foundation. The committee found “no support for the claims made in the complaint,” the report states, but found Sparks took “one to three votes with an apparent conflict of interest.”
The committee’s inquiry concluded with a “letter of reproval,” the lowest punishment for violations of House ethics rules.
Interviewed by telephone Wednesday evening, Sparks said he was not aware of the ethics committee inquiry and would have liked an opportunity to review the findings before they were made public.
“I just feel like it’s antithetical to our system of government, of due process, to not even tell somebody that you’re being investigated, or that there’s an allegation against you, or that you possibly could have even done more, or even have a chance to defend yourself,” Sparks said. “This is just a way to arbitrarily issue something to attack somebody’s character.”
State Rep. Lane Roberts, a Joplin Republican who chairs the committee, said in a text that he could not comment on the report. 
The committee held two meetings to consider the complaint prior to Wednesday’s meeting to approve the report.
Asked if Sparks was informed of the committee’s inquiry, Robert said that “to the best of my knowledge, he was not.”
Republican candidate for Missouri House speaker draws scrutiny over $6 million earmark

The committee’s rules do not explicitly require the subject of complaint to be told unless the committee decides to move forward with a more formal investigation. All deliberations on complaints are conducted in closed session.
In 2023, when Sparks was a newly elected legislator, he sought an appropriation to create a child care facility serving employees of the St. Louis County Police Department. The budget passed that May with $6 million set aside from Missouri’s allocation of child care funding in the 2021 American Rescue Plan Act.
The contract to use the money was awarded to the National Law Enforcement Foundation, which hired Sparks as its regional representative in November 2023, a job he retained until last month.
The Independent reported on Sparks employment with NLEF in January, as Sparks ran unsuccessfully for speaker of the Missouri House.
While Sparks listed the employment on his personal financial disclosure reports filed at the end of 2023 and 2024, he did not “file a written report of a substantial personal or private interest in the appropriation bills with the Chief Clerk of the House of Representatives before voting on such legislation,” the ethics committee report states.
When the fiscal year 2024 budget was being finalized in the spring of 2023, Sparks did not work for NLEF. The money, however, was not disbursed until fiscal year 2025, and when Sparks voted for the budget last year, the funding was included as a reappropriation.
Sparks said he was not aware of the law requiring a formal filing about his employment.
“What I could have done was file a conflict of interest form that I did not know existed, and that’s what I could have and would have done if I had known that the money had not been distributed yet,” Sparks said.
So far, $3.7 million of the money has been spent. There is $2.2 million included in a supplemental appropriation bill for the remainder of the current fiscal year, which passed on March 5. Sparks said he voted for the bill after informing NLEF he was resigning.
A knowing violation of the disclosure law cited by the committee is a Class B misdemeanor, punishable by up to 6 months in jail or a fine of up to $1,000 or both.
In the letter, the committee wrote that proper disclosure “would have helped prevent the appearance of a conflict of interest and furthered public transparency of the appropriation process.”
Sparks said he felt he had made the necessary disclosures. And if he was caught not making disclosures he knew were required, he said, he would admit it.
“If there was some kind of something that I did knowingly or intentionally,” Sparks said, “I would own it.”

Jermaine Johnson, D-Columbia, speaks in the South Carolina House Wednesday, April 2, 2025, in opposition to a bill prohibiting diversity, equity and inclusion initiatives. (Screenshot of SCETV legislative livestream)COLUMBIA — South Carolina’s Republican-controlled House passed a bill prohibiting state agencies, local governments and universities from violating federal discrimination laws with initiatives promoting diversity, equity and inclusion.
The bill also requires private businesses with government contracts to certify they don’t violate federal discrimination laws.
Republicans insist two words inserted into the bill — “illegal discrimination” — mean it does nothing to existing programs operating legally. Their argument was that it’s an anti-DEI bill that cracks down on “radical” mandates and protects “equal treatment under the law” without affecting legal diversity efforts.
Whether that’s true or not, opponents said, it still has a chilling effect across the state.
The legislation, which passed 82-32 along party lines Wednesday, bans all state agencies, public schools and local governments from giving preferential treatment in hiring or enrollment decisions — or, on the flip side discriminating against anyone — based on a person’s race, gender, religion, or other aspects of their identity.
SC anti-DEI bill could impact everything from school cafeterias to university bookstores

It bars government entities from having offices “for the promotion of diversity, equity and inclusion” and forbids them from requiring statements from applicants expressing support for these types of efforts.
Before the final vote, a GOP-led amendment also re-inserted a ban on contracting with private companies with so-called DEI programs. That ban was removed during the committee process following testimony on the far-reaching consequences of such a requirement.
Republicans congratulated themselves as being part of the national anti-DEI movement by adopting the legislative framework of executive orders signed by President Donald Trump banning DEI initiatives at the federal level.
Those orders are currently facing legal challenges over their constitutionality.
The legislation passed despite hours of testimony from college students, professors, and K-12 teachers, as well as advocacy organizations representing women, LGBTQ+ people, racial minorities and South Carolinians with disabilities opposing the effort.

“During the debate you heard a lot of inaccuracies. You heard a lot of fear mongering,” Rep. Shannon Erickson, chairwoman of the House Education and Public Works Committee, said Wednesday on the floor.
“The truth of this bill is that it stops illegal discrimination,” the Beaufort Republican added. “If a program is operating legally, without violating anti-discrimination laws, then programs should remain in place.”
She called it a “critical step toward protecting students and educators from political agendas that have no place in our classrooms.”
Sherry East, president of the South Carolina Education Association, had a completely different take.
It’s an “intrusion of divisive national politics into the living rooms, meeting rooms, and classrooms of South Carolinians,” she said in a release after the vote. “Moreover, it reflects a troubling and ongoing confusion and misrepresentation regarding the distinction between DEI initiatives and discrimination.”
The problem, said Rep. Jermaine Johnson, is that what constitutes “illegal discrimination” is up to interpretation and has already led universities to self-police and shy away from certain programs out of an abundance of caution.
If passed, the state attorney general would be charged with enforcement.
“So instead of going through that situation, (colleges) say, ‘You know what, let’s just take down the signs at the multicultural center,'” the Columbia Democrat said. “Let’s just go ahead and do this regardless.”
Democrats argued the loss of DEI programs would leave those who face economic or other disadvantages that more often impact minority populations without support to overcome hurdles not encountered by more affluent peers.

“This is no longer the anti-DEI bill to me. This is the anti-opportunity bill,” said Rep. Wendell Jones, D-Piedmont. “You’re closing the door on so many people. We’re going to lose businesses. We’re going to lose talent. We’re going to lose championships. Because those same kids are now looking to ‘blue’ states to try to figure out where can I go to play. … Let me go where they appreciate me.”
After hearing testimony from Black Democrats, who one after another stood to share personal experiences facing racial discrimination, the General Assembly’s lone Black Republican stepped up to make the party’s final argument for passage of the bill.
“I stand before you and say this, DEI is not going to be the force of the future that shapes our doctors, lawyers,” Rep. Harriet Holman. “We need, here in South Carolina, a meritocracy. We need to reward talent, hard work and determination.”

The Ridgeville Republican spoke of her 28 years of service in the U.S. Army, retiring in 2010 as a lieutenant colonel.
“I am not going to allow anyone to measure my success by DEI. It is not based on my identity. It is based on my hard work,” she said. “I hope for a future where we have an environment where our young people rise to success … not because of their color, and because they have earned every bit of it.”
The bill expands on legislation passed by the House last year that applied only to public colleges, banning them from factoring applicants’ political stances into hiring, firing and admission decisions.

(Micah Drew/ Daily Montanan)Fixing bridges and roads, while funding nursing homes and law enforcement officers took center stage Wednesday on the House floor with the full chamber’s first look at Montana’s big budget bill — a plan that costs $16.6 billion.
Last fall, Gov. Greg Gianforte proposed his budget for the next biennium, and since the beginning of the 2025 Montana Legislature, House subcommittees have combed through the request and put their fingerprints on it.
Wednesday, House Appropriations Chairperson Llew Jones, R-Conrad, and the chairpeople of the subcommittees presented the various sections of House Bill 2 on health, justice, education and natural resources and transportation.
Jones said the budget is the result of a lot of time and work by staff and legislators, and the product before his colleagues generally followed growth in inflation and population.
Given the hours of investment legislators had put into HB 2 the last three months, he urged his fellow representatives to stick with the bill as is and avoid any amendments — either to increase or decrease it.
“It has some discipline and is transparent,” Jones said.
But adopting a budget is job No. 1 for the legislature, and Rep. Bill Mercer, R-Billings, advocating for his own amendment, said legislators shouldn’t just be rubber stamps.
“You’re not a potted plant here. You have to exercise your own judgement as to whether this makes sense,” Mercer said.
The largest chunk of the bill goes to the Department of Public Health and Human Services, or Section B, an estimated 44%, according to a budget overview from the Legislative Fiscal Division.

That’s $7.3 billion for the 2026 and 2027 fiscal years.
Education accounts for $3.5 billion, and transportation and natural resources make up $2.9 billion.
Rep. Mary Caferro, vice chairperson for House Appropriations, said the budget is a statement of legislator values, and she too thanked staff from the Legislative Fiscal Division, “the smartest people in the whole Capitol.”
“The people of Montana deserve a fair budget that makes life more affordable and provides them the freedom that comes from economic security and good health,” said Caferro, D-Helena.
After a full day of review, the House adopted the budget bill on a 60-39 vote.
“Let’s send it onto the Senate and let the work continue,” Jones said.

Transportation and natural resources
Montana’s population is increasing, and the state is feeling effects of both the population growth and tourism, said Rep. Jerry Schillinger, R-Circle.
“It’s affected all of these departments,” said Schillinger, chairperson of Section C.
His committee reviewed Fish, Wildlife and Parks, the Department of Environmental Quality, the Department of Transportation, the Department of Natural Resources and Conservation, and the Department of Livestock.
For example, he said, the state needs to fix bridges, although the number of people needed for the job was debated in an amendment, as was a hunter education course for Montana.
The legislature added 22 people to the Department of Transportation, many to work on bridges, although with money from state and federal fees.
It also added four meat inspectors in the Department of Livestock, one portion of an overall 6.4% increase for the biennium from the 2025 base, or $2.1 million overall.
In an explanation for the meat inspectors, Schillinger said the pandemic brought to light how fragile food systems have become, and those employees will help with safety.
He also said the Department of Environmental Quality has been affected “in a large way” with housing and commercial developments and legal challenges related to permitting.
As a result, he said, nine more people are budgeted to handle the growing caseload for that agency at a cost of $2.3 million for the biennium.
That amount is part of a 7.2% increase for the biennium altogether, or $9.7 million, including $5.4 million for mine reclamation.
All told, Schillinger said his section added 63 positions for a total of 3,973.
On the floor, Mercer tried to cut an engineer and project manager from the Department of Transportation budget, or two positions altogether out of 16, but the amendment failed.

He said everyone is committed to bridges, but he didn’t see the need for the total number of new employees.
“I think that’s excessive,” Mercer said.
But Schillinger and others said the legislature discussed it, a number of bridges are under restrictions, and Montana roads need the resources.
Rep. Marilyn Marler, D-Missoula, pitched a successful amendment to reinsert a hunter education program into the budget, which she argued is a healthy and important part of the state’s culture and heritage.
Marler also said it wasn’t costing taxpayers because the dollars come from hunting licenses and an excise tax on guns and ammunition.
Rep. Shannon Maness, R-Dillon, said it pained him to speak in support of a budget increase, but the money was already allocated for that purpose — and it’s needed.
“This program is suffering,” Maness said of hunter education. “It’s been hampered in recent years.”

Public Safety
The public safety portion of the budget, comprising five agencies, is led by Rep. Fiona Nave, R-Columbus, and is the smallest of the budget sections.
“These dollars really, really have to stretch over things that we are required to do,” Nave said. 
Nave summarized the budgets for the judicial branch, Department of Justice, Office of Public Defender, Department of Corrections and the Public Service Commission, the latter of which receives no general fund money. 
The budget approved in committee gave substantial, 9% raises to highway patrol to address poor retention, which Nave said was one of the biggest issues in state law enforcement. 
“The officers end up moving from agency to agency depending upon who can pay them the most. And unfortunately, the state’s a little bit disadvantaged because of the timing,” Nave said “We end up having to do it first and then all the counties can take a look and say, okay, you know, can I match that.”
Another big ask came from the judiciary, where the courts asked for additional judges in Yellowstone County to handle increased caseload. The committee approved two of the requested three judges, but added a condition requesting the 10 judges in the county to look at having specialized dockets to streamline the process. 
The Department of Corrections saw the largest increase in the budget with a $68 million bump. The biggest chunk of that is nearly $24 million in contracts for out-of-state prison beds — roughly three times what the state originally paid in 2023 to send 120 inmates to Arizona.  
Now, Montana houses 600 male inmates in out-of-state prisons owned by private prison operator CoreCivic, and while the Legislature is considering hundreds of millions of dollars for DOC capital projects, it is unlikely to make much headway in the backlog of inmates in Montana’s penal system. 
Rep. S.J. Howell, D-Missoula, brought an amendment to strip the funding to send inmates out of state, citing concerns over accountability and oversight at private prison facilities, but the House opposed the change, with Rep. John Fitzpatrick, R-Anaconda, calling the argument “completely fallacious.”  
Nave said that while she was sympathetic to Howell’s position, the state was “in a crisis” and had no other choice but to pay. 
“There are no places to put these people. If we’re not going to fund this, you can either put bunk beds in places we have now or put them on the streets,” she said. “The money put here in the line item is to pay for the beds we are already utilizing and that we need to pay for. We are obligated.”
Another amendment to increase funding for the Office of Public Defender — which the committee funded below what the department had asked for — also failed. 
But one amendment introduced on the floor did pass. Earlier in the session Speaker Pro Tempore Katie Zolnikov, R-Billings, carried a bill to create a railroad safety inspection program within the PSC as a standalone bill, which passed the chamber 98-2 before being tabled in the Appropriations Committee. 
Her budget amendment asked for half the inspection staff the original bill requested, and many lawmakers spoke in support, pointing to recent train derailments in Montana as a need. 
Rep. Neil Duram, R-Eureka, said he wanted to avoid another scenario like a 2021 Amtrak derailment that killed 3 people and injured more than 50. 
“That’s the event that we want to prevent. If $200,000 will get us there, I’m a yes.”

Health and Human Services
The Department of Public Health and Human Services accounts for nearly half of the entire budget for HB 2, more than $7 billion for the biennium.
Rep. Jane Gillette, R-Three Forks, served as chairperson for that subcommittee, and she said the good news is that the legislature trimmed the budget slightly from the governor’s proposal.
However, she also said one difficulty is declining federal match dollars for health programs. Gillette said for every 1% decline in federal match, Montana has to pay from $16 million to $17 million.
“That’s going to present some serious future challenges for us,” Gillette said.
  Rep. Jane Gillette rests her laptop on a binder containing Montana’s budget for the next biennium. (Micah Drew/Daily Montanan)
Caferro said Gillette ran a fair subcommittee, and such leadership is important because many members of the public from all walks of life testify there.
“We see the faces of the people behind all of these decisions and numbers and lines on pieces of paper,” Caferro said.
To Caferro, the agenda represented a “strong agenda for children,” for babies, toddlers and families.
“Children don’t ask what home to be born into, but I believe it’s government’s role to take care of children first and foremost,” Caferro said.
The cost for the biennium is 1.6% lower than the base in 2025, according to the overview from the Legislative Fiscal Division.
Highlights include one-time funding of $79.5 million to operate facilities including the Montana State Hospital, nearly $2 billion for Medicaid expansion, provider rate increases for Medicaid and non-Medicaid providers, and a cut of 80 net positions out of 2,832.
The House considered numerous amendments — to cut and add — and all but one, characterized as a technical adjustment, failed. 
Mercer, a fiscal conservative, proposed numerous amendments to trim the budget, and his proposals failed, but other legislators joked that they would work on softening his heart.
“My heart is plenty soft,” Mercer joked back.

General Government
Rep. Terry Falk, R-Kalispell said much of the work on the general government section of HB 2 was about ensuring “we have good transparency and accountability in state government.”
The committee reviewed the Legislative branch, Consumer Council, Governor’s Office, the Commissioner of Public Practices, the Auditor’s Office, the Department of Revenue, the Department of Administration, the Department of Labor and Industry, and the Department of Military Affairs.
Some of that was seen in the Legislative branch, which received information and technology upgrades, including an additional $229,000 in one-time funding to increase the public’s access to lobbying information.
The State Auditor’s Office also received money for consumer information and fraud prevention. The Department of Military Affairs also saw a boost, with the budget adding $3.8 million to develop 14 new positions.
Rep. Luke Muszkiewicz, D-Helena, said the section was about the people behind the numbers and that state employees are “knowledgeable, conscientious and dedicated public servants who are committed to serving the people of Montana.”
Falk said there was some pushback at times, but called out the tension between the Legislature and the Executive office, saying “it should be there.”
Three amendments were brought, with just one passing from Falk. It eliminated $12.9 million from the general fund, state special revenue, federal special revenue, and proprietary funding that was set to go to the Recruitment and Retention Contingency Fund, the largest cut made to the budget on the floor.
“I think in general, things were restrained,” Falk said. “I would like to have seen us do more.”

Education
Chairman David Bedey, R-Hamilton, highlighted investments the state is making in education. Bedey’s subcommittee reviewed the Office of Public Instruction, the Board of Public Education, the Office of the Commissioner of Higher Education, the Montana School for the Deaf and Blind, the Montana Arts Council, the Montana State Library and the Montana Historical Society.
The Office of Public Instruction received a 10% increase in funding for the Local Education Activities Program, which involves aid for major maintenance projects, debt service assistance and school lunch funding. The budget also includes an increase in teacher pay, which is contingent on the passage of House Bill 252, which has come to be known as the STARS Act and is a major education proposal this session.
There’s also $640,000 for a study of high schools and $2 million for OPI for database modernization. Several bills — HB 515, HB 551, SB 322 — will have to pass for some appropriations to go through. There’s also money for the agency to add seven new staff.
Bedey also added the committee had made some adjustments and cuts “to align the budget with actual projected spending for the unanticipated significant enrollment appropriation.”
There’s also money to study how AI will be used in classrooms, which will be implemented by the Montana Digital Academy. 
“Its purpose is to get our arms around how AI is going to influence education and the kind of educational materials that we more and more rely upon, like online materials, to support,” Bedey said. “We don’t use books like they did when I was a kid.”
The Montana State Library will also see some increases, mostly for personal services and fixed costs. 
The Montana Historical Society also received an increase — including a one-time appropriation of $1 million to plan for the country’s 250th birthday — as well as half a million for operation of the Montana Historical Society.",https://dailymontanan.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/House-1-1024x575.jpg,,,2025-04-02 20:59:18.655807

House Bill 472 is the House’s revised version of a so-called medical freedom bill that Gov. Brad Little recently vetoed. 
The House’s 40-minute debate Wednesday turned contentious and oftentimes definitional. Bill cosponsor Rep. Robert Beiswenger, R-Horseshoe Bend, once refused to answer a question from another lawmaker.

Opening the House’s debate, Beiswenger said the bill “prevents medical force, medical mandates. People can choose them if they want to, but they don’t have to if they don’t want to. You can ask people to leave your place of business. But you can’t force them into medical treatments like vaccines or other kinds of treatments.”
A quarter of the Idaho House’s 70 lawmakers rose to debate the bill, which was evenly split in support and opposition. But the House ultimately passed the bill on a 46-21 vote, with one fewer vote in support than the House’s vote on the original bill, Senate Bill 1023, two weeks ago. (Three House members were absent for Wednesday’s vote. None were absent for the original bill vote.)
Critics’ central concern on the bill was that it would prevent workplaces from refusing service — or entrance of their facilities — to sick people.

 Pressed on if the bill prevents businesses from forcing people to leave, sponsor suggested he believes it wouldn’t

Asked three times if the bill would prevent that by Rep. Dan Garner, R-Clifton, Beiswenger replied by suggesting he believed it would not.

“Can the business ask someone to leave — force someone to leave, if they feel like they are sick?” Garner asked.
“Again, the bill doesn’t address it directly. But I believe a business would be within their rights to ask someone to leave if they are sick,” Beiswenger replied.
Garner didn’t seem convinced. 
“This bill, to me, goes a step too far (in) that it imposes someone’s freedom or rights on their private property or private business,” he said. 
Debating in favor of the bill, Rep. Kyle Harris, R-Lewiston, argued that debate was straying from the bill’s intent.

Debating against the bill, Rep. Ben Fuhriman, R-Shelley, and Rep. Todd Achilles, D-Boise, referenced the bill’s specific language.
“I don’t care what your intentions are. A law is a law,” Fuhriman said. “And it’s written right here on page two, line 29: A business entity doing business in the state of Idaho shall not refuse to provide any service, product, admission to a venue, or transportation to a person — because that person has or has not received or used a medical intervention.”

 Medical mandates include diagnosis or treatment. Ban extends to entry or service refusal. 

After Gov. Little vetoes Idaho ‘medical freedom’ bill, Legislature pursues tweaks

Like the original bill that Little vetoed, two new bills introduced this week in the House and Senate would pursue similarly broad medical mandate bans. 
The bills would ban businesses and any Idaho governments — local, county or state — from requiring medical interventions for employment, admission to venues, transportation, or providing products or services.
The bill would’ve also extended to schools in Idaho — private or public — and colleges, universities and trade schools, blocking them from requiring medical interventions for school attendance, employment, or entrance into campus or school buildings.
Under the bills, medical interventions include “a procedure, treatment, device, drug injection, medication, or action taken to diagnose, prevent, or cure a disease or alter the health or biological function of a person.” (The House tweaked the bill Wednesday to add a comma between “drug” and “injection.”)
 New bills tweak originals to address governor’s school concerns. But it’s unclear which will succeed. 

The House’s revised bill, House Bill 472, adds language specifying that the bill wouldn’t overrule existing powers of school districts, or school board trustees — as already granted in Idaho law. After passing the House on Wednesday, the bill is headed to the Senate for consideration 
The Senate’s revised bill, Senate Bill 1210, exempts day cares and adds language specifying the school medical mandate ban provision is subject to various other Idaho laws that let school boards block sick students from attending, spell out parental rights, and more.
The Senate amended its version on Wednesday by tweaking the new language related to schools. 
It’s not immediately clear when the Senate will vote on the amended bill, or consider the House’s version. 
To become law, Idaho bills must pass the House and Senate, and avoid the governor’s veto.

Bryan King, R-Green Forest, asks a question during a Dec. 6, 2024 committee meeting about a prison planned for Franklin County. (Mary Hennigan/Arkansas Advocate)The Arkansas Senate on Wednesday rejected for the second day in a row a $750 appropriation bill to support construction of a new 3,000-bed prison in Franklin County. 
Opposition to Senate Bill 354 grew Wednesday with three more senators — Republicans Alan Clark, Steve Crowell and Dan Sullivan — joining ten colleagues who voted against the legislation Tuesday.
Proponents of expanding prison capacity, including the governor, argue the new prison is necessary to address overcrowding in county jails. Officials last month set the preliminary cost estimate of the project at $825 million. 
Local officials and residents were caught off guard last October when Gov. Sarah Huckabee Sanders announced the state’s $2.95 million purchase of 815 acres near Charleston for the project. Community members and elected officials have pushed back against the project for months.
Prison appropriation bill stalls in Arkansas Senate

Sen. Bryan King, a Green Forrest Republican who’s been a vocal opponent from the start, on Wednesday referenced costly prison projects in states like Utah, and said building a 3,000-bed penitentiary in the rural western Arkansas county would be fiscally irresponsible.
“These mega prisons are still mega-financial disasters,” he said. “The only winners are going to be the prison building companies out of state that’s going to take millions of our dollars.”
King also criticized the decision to not expand the state’s Calico Rock prison. Former Gov. Asa Hutchinson proposed expanding the facility by roughly 500 beds using surplus funds, and state lawmakers approved $75 million in reserve funds for the project in December 2022. 
That was put on hold when Sanders threw her support behind the Protect Arkansas Act, a 2023 law that, among other things, removes the possibility of parole for the state’s most serious offenders. Inmates serving more of their sentences means more prison space will be needed, which Sen. Justin Boyd, R-Fort Smith, said needs to be addressed.
“In this chamber we voted to create new penalties for Arkansans…so we all want to say we’re tough on crime, but yet then we don’t want to provide the space,” Boyd said. 
The Legislature set aside $330 million in 2023 to support the governor’s prison expansion efforts, but disputes between the executive branch and the Board of Corrections, and among state lawmakers, have delayed the project.
While the process may not have been perfect, state lawmakers need to find a way to fund this effort to protect constituents, Corning Republican Sen. Blake Johnson said.
“I appreciate everybody’s differences, but please let’s try to work together for the safety of Arkansas citizens,” he said. 
Johnson was one of 18 senators who voted in favor of the measure Wednesday, one fewer than Tuesday. Sen. Missy Irvin, R-Mountain View, voted for the measure Tuesday, but did not vote Wednesday. Sen. Ken Hammer, R-Benton, who did not vote Tuesday, cast an affirmative vote Wednesday. Sullivan supported the measure Tuesday, but voted against it Wednesday.
SB 354 has twice failed in the Senate because appropriation bills require 27 votes to advance out of the upper chamber. There is no restriction on how many times lawmakers can vote on an appropriation bill, but they only have until the end of the session to advance legislation to the governor for final approval. The General Assembly is expected to finish considering bills by April 16.

Ross Williams/Georgia RecorderA bill aimed at banning gender-affirming care for inmates housed in Georgia prisons passed the state House Wednesday 100-2 after nearly all House Democrats walked out on the vote. 
House Minority Leader Carolyn Hugley of Columbus characterized the bill as part of a Republican fixation on a small population of transgender Georgians and a waste of time. Friday is the final day of the annual 40-day legislative session.
“This is day 39, day 39 and we don’t have a budget, and many of our members’ bills have not been heard,” Hugley said. “We came here to focus on the opportunity for Georgians to live, learn and earn. And what do we get? Political theater. What do we get? Bills that want to legalize discrimination. What do we get? A whole lot of nothing. And our citizens deserve better than this. They deserve better than this. I’ve been in these halls over 30 years, and I know that we can be better than what we’re seeing today.”
As far as either side can tell, there are five people incarcerated in Georgia attempting to seek gender-affirming care. Gender-affirming care can range from hormone pills to surgeries, and it’s not clear what the five are seeking. Republican lawmakers have said the Georgia Department of Corrections requested the bill. 
The ban on gender-affirming care in Georgia’s prisons is one of five GOP bills focused on transgender Georgians this legislative session, including a pair of dueling measures banning transgender athletes from girls’ sports in K-12 and college that were melded into one proposal that now sits on Gov. Brian Kemp’s desk.

Democrats said the walkout was less about the specific bill before them Wednesday and more about what they called an all-out attack on LGBTQ Georgians. 
“We have so many bills with so little data on the reason why we’re even drafting these bills, and it’s a step that had to be taken,” said Rep. Imani Barnes, a Democrat from Tucker. “There’s too many trans bills. They’re attacking the LGBTQ community for no reason. I’m a part of that community, and it means a lot to me.”
Duluth Democratic Rep. Ruwa Romman called the prison bill “strike three” after the House passed the two bills aimed at eliminating transgender participation in school sports. 
“We have had no bills on raising the minimum wage,” she said. “We have had one bill pass about housing. We have had no bills on Medicaid expansion. I don’t even know what’s going on with the budget. And you’re telling me that we are going to spend more time on another bill to discriminate?” 
The Democrats walked out after Rep. Tanya Miller, an Atlanta Democrat who serves as House minority caucus chair, delivered a searing speech on Republicans’ focus on transgender Georgians and what she called a manufactured crisis. 
“We could be solving and tackling the big problems that we are sent here, this body of 180 members, with the learned speaker, collectively representing the state, solving as best we can the big problems, but yet we waste time,” Miller said in her speech.

Critics of the ban on gender-affirming care in prisons argue it is unconstitutional and will invite legal challenges. 
Republicans blasted the Democrats for walking out instead of staying to debate the merits of the bill and representing their constituents through a vote. Several Republicans could be seen taking photos of the vote board on the wall that showed dozens of Democrats absent. They continued the one-sided debate as a sea of seats were left empty. 
While lawmakers from both parties commonly “take a walk” on hot issues, including on some of the transgender-focused bills this year, a coordinated walkout is rare. Several Democrats walked out during a bitter debate over abortion restrictions in 2019. 
House Majority Leader Chuck Efstration, a Republican from Mulberry, said the Democrats who participated in Wednesday’s walkout should be punished at the ballot box. 
“Rather than support a common sense measure to ensure that Georgia taxpayer dollars don’t fund sex changes for criminal prisoners, Democrats left,” Efstration said. “That’s tantamount to saying they’re not going to represent their district, they’re unwilling to put a vote up on the board. And I think that their actions should be considered accordingly.”
The bill’s author, Cataula Republican Sen. Randy Robertson, framed the issue similarly.
“While I appreciate the fact that we’re not always going to agree on everything that goes on up here, I think we have to have the stamina, the backbone, and the gumption to stay in the fight, to push for those who send us up here, and to never surrender and turn our backs and walk out on our constituents,” Robertson said. 
Not all Democrats participated in the walkout. Three Democratic representatives – Lynn Heffner of Augusta, Tangie Herring of Macon and Dexter Sharper of Valdosta – stayed and voted for the bill. Two others – Albany Democratic Rep. David Sampson and McDonough Democratic Rep. Regina Lewis Ward – voted against it. Those who stayed were applauded by Republican lawmakers. 
“I will be supporting this bill because I support an individual’s choice but I support the people’s decision on whether or not they pay for those elective procedures,” Heffner said. 
Opponents of the bill counter that gender-affirming care encompasses more than surgeries and can be necessary for a person’s wellbeing.

But less than two hours after the Joint Finance-Appropriations Committee, or JFAC, redrafted those two budgets, the Idaho House of Representatives killed a different budget – House Bill 475, one of the public school budget enhancements.
All the budget back-and-forth is a telling signal of where the Idaho Legislature found itself Wednesday: 87 days into a contentious session where mainstream Republicans and Democrats in the minority are having to fight tooth-and-nail against hardline conservatives to pass budgets.

During a rare afternoon meeting – and its second meeting of the day Wednesday – the Joint Finance-Appropriations Committee drafted failed budgets for the Idaho Office of Energy and Mineral Resources and Idaho Transportation Department.
The Joint Finance-Appropriations Committee, or JFAC, sets every budget for every state agency and department and then sends those budgets to the full Idaho House of Representatives and Idaho Senate for consideration. 
The Idaho Senate killed earlier versions of both budgets in recent days.
 Finding compromise on Idaho’s budget bills 

The Senate killed an earlier version of the Idaho Office of Energy and Mineral Resources budget, Senate Bill 1191, on Friday. Senators then killed an earlier version of the Idaho Transportation Department budget, Senate Bill 1205, on Tuesday.

However, after changes were made both budgets made it through JFAC on Wednesday without incident or serious opposition – signaling that legislators may have reached some sort of compromise that could eventually pave the way for them to pass the remaining unfinished budgets and adjourn the legislative session for the year.
“Our hope is that this will be our last JFAC meeting, unless either the House or the Senate kills something and we might have to come back,” said Sen. Scott Grow, an Eagle Republican who serves as the co-chair of JFAC. 
Some JFAC members themselves even spoke openly of a compromise during Wednesday afternoon’s meeting. 
“I would like to congratulate the committee, because the definition of compromise is when everybody’s unhappy, and I think we achieved that – except for the good chairman (Grow),” said Rep. Steven Miller, R-Fairfield. “We have a different Legislature than we’ve had before. We’ve got a different committee than we’ve had before, and so we’re going to learn how to compromise and learn how to work ourselves through that process and to do it civilly and understand that there’s times that you feel things so passionately about, this is very difficult to let go of that.”
Grow also spoke of negotiation and compromise.
“I always hope we’re trying to do more good than bad, and that’s our objective,” Grow said. “I think we’ve accomplished that as people have negotiated. (There’s) been a lot of back and forth, a lot of strong feelings. But I feel that everybody has acted civilly, respectfully. So we commend the committee for the great work you’ve done and the great attitude in which you’ve done the work.”
 What changed in the rewritten Idaho budgets? 

In the new Idaho Transportation Department budget, JFAC members removed budget intent language that the Idaho Senate objected to Tuesday night when it killed the earlier budget in a  lopsided 3-31 vote. Budget writers also reduced funding for Idaho Transportation Department divisions by $100. 
For the Idaho Office of Energy and Mineral Resources budget, JFAC zeroed out a $481,000 request from Gov. Brad Little to create a SPEED Council to expedite the review of permits for large scale projects like mines or energy transmission lines. 
For the second time, JFAC also refused to accept $24.6 million in federal grant funding to provide Home Energy Rebates Program rebates to Idahoans who buy new appliances or increase the efficiency of their home. Idahoans could have accessed a total of $80.1 million in federal funding for the rebates through 2031, the Idaho Capital Sun previously reported. But once again, JFAC refused. State budget analysts told JFAC members that if Idaho passes up the federal funding, the money will go to other states participating in the program – the money won’t be available to cut taxes or reduce the federal budget deficit.

Rep. James Petzke, R-Meridian, voted for the budget because he said it needs to pass and be finished. But Petzke said he is disappointed by walking away from the funding, and that he hopes Idaho residents speak out against the Legislature for doing so. 
“We’re basically giving up tens of millions of dollars that could have gone into Idaho’s economy,” Petzke said. “And it’s not going to. It’s going to go to other states instead. And that’s extremely disappointing. But it’s where we’re at right now as a body, it seems. And so I hope that people are upset about that and let us know, because I think that this is unfortunate for Idaho’s economy.”
Both the Idaho Department of Labor budget and the Idaho Office of Energy and Mineral Resources budgets still need to pass the full Idaho House and Idaho Senate in order to take effect.
Wednesday marked the 87th day of the 2025 legislative session. Legislators already missed their nonbinding target date to adjourn the session for the year March 21. Most Idaho legislative sessions run for about 80-90 days, although there is no requirement to adjourn by a certain date.

(Kentucky Lantern photo by McKenna Horsley)LOUISVILLE — After a week as president of the University of Louisville, Gerry Bradley on Wednesday fielded questions from faculty members about his surprise installment and his plans going forward, including how he will handle a new state ban on diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI) on Kentucky’s public campuses. 
Bradley, along with Board of Trustees Chair Diane Medley and Faculty Senate Chair Eugene Mueller, answered questions during the UofL Faculty Senate’s Wednesday meeting about the events leading up to the sudden departure of former President Kim Schatzel. 
Last week, the board named Bradley as president and accepted Schatzel’s resignation in a special-called meeting. By doing so, the board decided to forgo a national search to name the next president. 
“Our journey is not changing at all,” Bradley told the faculty. “The same strong leadership team that’s been in place and has been built over the last several years is still here and we are still aligned and functioning (toward) the same goals.” 
Medley, the board chair, told reporters last week that “the goals” of Schatzel and the board had changed. She further clarified her comment while addressing the faculty representatives. 
“I didn’t mean different policy. It was just a different direction of choices of career, position, etc.,” Medley said. 
She added that the board knew “it was a fairly quick process, but we had multiple meetings. There were several meetings that were as a group with some discussions because we took it so seriously.” 
In recent years, DEI initiatives have been a Republican target. Since taking office in January, President Donald Trump has amped up anti-DEI pressure on government and educational institutions. Trump has issued executive orders against such programs in the federal government. The U.S. Justice Department has launched investigations into allegations that universities, including the University of Kentucky, have violated civil rights laws by promoting diversity among faculty. Kentucky Republicans passed a law in the state legislature — House Bill 4 — last week to prohibit DEI programs at the state’s public universities.
“We’re going to comply with the law, but there’s a lot of unknowns in there and contradictory language that’s still unclear to a lot of folks because we do not have a regulatory body around House Bill 4,” Bradley said. 
Bradley said UofL would be reviewing the law with all general counsels of Kentucky public universities and the office of Attorney General Russeull Coleman to “determine what exactly are the provisions of this bill and what are the carve outs and where is the crossing the line.”
Bradley was asked if he would have accepted an interim position. He said that would largely be a question for the board, but said from his perspective the university is facing “so many challenges right now,” such as securing government funding, that taking a year or two under an interim president to conduct a presidential search would have put the university at a disadvantage.
Bradley was poised to leave Louisville, having accepted the University of Cincinnati’s offer to become its executive vice president for academic affairs and provost. The day before Bradley was named Louisville president, the University of Cincinnati announced that Bradley had changed his mind and “is pursuing other opportunities.” 
The Redbook, UofL’s governing document, says the board “shall consult with a faculty committee” to appoint a new president, which did not happen because of the lack of search. However, state law says the board has authority to appoint a president. 
Mueller, who represents the faculty on the Board of Trustees, told senators he was aware of “shock and dismay” over the presidential appointment process and he shared those feelings. Mueller, however, did underscore that the board was limited in what it could publicly say about the Schatzel’s departure. 
“I know there’s some sense that my fellow trustees and I are hiding behind the legal requirement that we can’t talk. That is not how I view it all. I view it as shackles. I think it would be much easier for all of us if we could tell everything that happened and explain why we did what we did.” 
Mueller did address some rumors that Schatzel’s departure had to do with supporting or opposing DEI limits from politicians. He said no legislation was discussed during conversations about the change in president. 
Toward the end of the discussion, Marc Murphy, a law professor who is not part of the Faculty Senate, pressed the speakers to give clearer answers about the reasons for Schaztel’s departure, as the situation has gained the attention, not only of the campus but also politicians in Frankfort, including Gov. Andy Beshear, who told reporters he thinks universities should hire presidents through national searches.
“Before we can move forward, we have to have our feet on the ground looking backward,” Murphy said. “No one knows what happened. You haven’t answered a single question about what happened and you’ve relied on the fact that you’re not allowed to.”
Mueller told Murphy he did “wish I could tell you.” 
“You are not the university counsel,” Mueller said. “You’re not the one issuing … legal advice to us.” 
Before being named president, Bradley was UofL’s executive vice president and university provost for three years. He joined UofL as dean of the School of Dentistry in 2016.
Bradley, the 20th president of the university, said he plans to continue following its strategic plan and begin work on the next guiding plan. 
Schatzel was UofL’s president for about two years.

Wyden's staff — and we have discussed this just now — we are open to meeting with the author of the letter and keeping the individual anonymous,” Crapo said. “However, any information provided by the individual must be thoroughly vetted, including allowing the nominee the opportunity to respond.”Oregon Democratic Sen. Ron Wyden, ranking member on the panel, urged Crapo to delay the vote until after a committee investigation, alleging Bisignano was untruthful during his testimony.  “This nominee lied multiple times to every member of this committee, including the bipartisan Finance staff and the nominee's actions and communications with DOGE remain very much at the heart of my objection here,” Wyden said. “My office received an account from a whistleblower about the ways the nominee was deeply involved in and aware of DOGE's activities at the agency.”Wyden said that Bisignano, though not confirmed and with no official role yet at the agency, intervened at the Social Security Administration to ensure that staff from U.S. DOGE Services had “immediate access to Social Security systems.” DOGE, or Department of Government Efficiency, is a temporary Trump administration entity aimed at slashing the federal workforce and spending.Wyden also argued that Bisignano’s history in corporate America wasn’t a good fit for running the Social Security Administration, saying he “has made a career of swooping in, firing workers, selling off pieces of the company and merging with a competitor.”“These practices may be good for shareholders, but they hurt American families,” Wyden said. “So we, Senate Democrats, are not going to stand by idly while Trump's cronies take a sledgehammer to Social Security and deprive seniors of their earned benefits under the false manner of fighting fraud.”Bisignano hearingBisignano, of New Jersey, testified before the committee for nearly three hours in late March, fielding questions on several issues, including overpayments and customer service.He pledged to reduce the 1% overpayment rate significantly and said he could bring down the average wait time for customer service phone calls from about 20 minutes to less than one minute.“If you look at the Social Security website, and you look at the statistics, taking 20-plus minutes to answer the phone is not really acceptable,” Bisignano said during his confirmation hearing. “And that's the reason why only 46% of the phone calls get answered, because people get discouraged and hang up.”Bisignano promised senators he would ensure Americans’ personal information would be kept secure.If confirmed by the full Senate, Bisignano testified he would “ensure that every beneficiary receives their payments on time, that disability claims are processed in the manner they should be.”“So my first actions are going to be to get organized around delivering the services,” Bisignano said. “And I've only been given one order, which is to run the agency in the right fashion.”He also rejected the possibility of privatizing Social Security.“I've never thought about privatizing. It's not a word that anybody's ever talked to me about,” Bisignano said. “And I don't see this institution as anything other than a government agency that gets run to the benefit of the American public.”Bisignano works as chairman of the board and chief executive officer at Fiserv, Inc., which ""enables money movement for thousands of financial institutions and millions of people and businesses,"" according to its website.

Senate Bill 5708 came at the request of Attorney General Nick Brown’s office and would have prevented social media companies from pushing addictive feeds and sending notification alerts during certain hours to children under age 18. Gov. Bob Ferguson also backed the bill.
It passed the Senate with bipartisan support, with eight Republicans joining Democrats, but failed to receive a hearing in the House Consumer Protection and Business Committee. 
The bill’s sponsor, Sen. Noel Frame, ​​D-Seattle, said she knew the bill needed more work, but was disappointed it didn’t receive a public hearing in the House.
“It ​​felt like a pretty abrupt end,” she said, adding that supporters had “already compromised quite a bit” on the bill.
Likewise, Brown said he was disappointed the bill didn’t get a House hearing, calling the proposal a “commonsense” step to improve youth mental health. 
“Compulsive social media use has demonstrably harmful impacts on young people. It’s disappointing not everyone is treating this crisis with the urgency it deserves,” he said.
The bill was also backed by the Washington Children’s Alliance, an advocacy organization, after conversations with educators and health officials raised alarm about how social media can negatively affect children.
Since the pandemic, there’s been an increase in depression and anxiety among children. In a 2023 advisory, the U.S. Surgeon General recommended that policymakers pursue policies to limit children’s access to social media to reduce the risk of harm. 
“The root cause of so much of the depression and anxiety that we see all across the nation for kids is because they all have access to phones and are getting pumped with all of these really harmful feeds that are coming at all hours of the day and night,” said Stephan Blanford, executive director of the Children’s Alliance. 
The lack of federal legislation has led to states taking action to address online safety for children and the behavioral problems it poses. California approved laws along these lines in 2022 and 2024 that industry-backed lawsuits have tied up in court.
Frame’s bill contains similar provisions to the California legislation. However, she said that many of the criticisms around the bill were distractions and that the attorney general was aware of the lawsuits and that the bill was designed to avoid traps seen in other states. 
“​​It’s a complicated bill,” she said, adding it was easy for the tech industry to highlight the flaws the bill initially had.  
Blanford said the Children’s Alliance worked with the attorney general’s office to draft the legislation and ensure it was constitutional and that the bill was designed to address some of the patterns that can leave children addicted to social media feeds. 
“Technology companies have a huge incentive, financial incentive, to addict our children to their products,” Blanford said. 
Rep. Amy Walen, D-Kirkland, the chair of the Consumer Protection and Business Committee, said concerns about the constitutionality of the bill and privacy violations for youth led to her decision not to hear it this session. 
“It felt like it wasn’t ready and that’s what I kept hearing from people,” Walen said. 
Walen rejected suggestions that her decision had to do with Microsoft being located in her district. 
“I work for the people,” Walen said. “The 48th legislative district, that’s who I work for.” 
Instead, Walen said she hoped to explore the issue further and work with technology companies to see how to refine the bill ahead of the next session.  
Sen. Keith Wagoner, R-Sedro Wooley, one of the cosponsors, said he supported the intent of the bill but still thinks it needs more work and that lawmakers need to engage further on it with tech companies and wait until the California litigation is resolved. 
Sen. Manka Dhingra, D-Redmond, was the only Democrat who voted against the bill when it passed the Senate. She said Tuesday that regulating technology can be a challenge.

Terry Rice (left), R-Waldron, asks a question during debate over Senate Bill 536 in the Senate chamber on Wednesday, April 2, 2025. (Tess Vrbin/Arkansas Advocate)The Arkansas Senate narrowly endorsed the elimination of the Arkansas State Library on Wednesday, but the bill did not receive enough support to go into effect July 1 if it becomes law.
Senate Bill 536 would transfer the authorities, funds, contracts and employees of the agency and its board to the Arkansas Department of Education. The State Library is already under the department’s umbrella but operates independently, and its board disburses state funds to public libraries on a quarterly basis.
Sen. Dan Sullivan, R-Jonesboro, is the bill’s sponsor and has repeatedly promised to dissolve the State Library Board. Sullivan broadened his intention to dissolve the entire State Library last month after he said the board did not satisfy the conditions he gave them for its survival.
Most laws go into effect 90 days after the end of a legislative session, around Aug. 1, but SB 536 had an emergency clause that would have allowed it to go into effect July 1. This provision was one of many aspects of the bill that library directors opposed Tuesday before it passed the Senate Committee on State Agencies and Governmental Affairs.
Misty Hawkins, regional director of the Arkansas River Valley Regional Library System, said it would be impossible to rework the interlocal agreements in the four counties she serves within three months to account for the language of SB 536. Several library systems in Arkansas encompass multiple counties.
Emergency clauses need the support of two-thirds of lawmakers, which is 24 votes in the Senate. SB 536 instead received 18 votes, the minimum for a simple majority.
Republican Sens. Breanne Davis of Russellville and Bryan King of Green Forest joined five of the six Senate Democrats in voting against the bill. Sen. Stephanie Flowers, D-Pine Bluff, and Sen. Kim Hammer, R-Benton, were absent. Three Republicans voted present and five did not vote.
The Senate subsequently approved a clincher motion from Sullivan with a voice vote. A clincher prevents a bill from receiving another vote in the applicable chamber, so the House will consider SB 536 without its emergency clause.

Bill to abolish Arkansas State Library and its board advances despite librarians’ opposition


Hawkins and three other library directors said Tuesday that SB 536 might cost them the state funding they need to operate their libraries. The bill’s criteria for receiving state funds include “prohibit[ing] access to age-inappropriate materials to a person who is sixteen (16) years old or younger.”
One-room libraries do not have segregated spaces to ensure that children under 16 cannot access specific material, and SB 536 says the Department of Education “may” disburse funds to libraries that meet the proposed criteria but does not mandate it, the library directors said. Sen. Clarke Tucker, D-Little Rock, repeated these concerns on the Senate floor Wednesday.
SB 536 defines “age-inappropriate material” as “books, media, or any other material accessible at a public library containing images or explicit and detailed descriptions” of sexual acts, sexual contact and human genitalia.
The State Library Board approved a motion at a special meeting March 13 to create “non-binding policies to protect children” while honoring First Amendment freedoms and libraries’ material selection policies. Sullivan had asked the board to pass a motion to protect children in libraries and to detach from the American Library Association; the board rejected two separate motions to these ends.
Sen. Terry Rice, R-Waldron, said he also asked State Library Board members to ensure that libraries keep inappropriate content away from children.
“It’s time for drastic things to happen if this incompetent bunch is going to continue to put our children at risk,” Rice said. “There’s going to be fallout, but we’ll fix the fallout.”
Tucker said the Legislature has the authority to reconstitute the State Library Board instead of dissolving it and its parent agency if lawmakers are dissatisfied with its actions or inactions.
Library directors and State Library Board members have repeatedly said, including at Tuesday’s committee meeting, that libraries already organize books on shelves in an age-appropriate manner in accordance with existing standards.
The location and availability of books based on “appropriateness” for minors was the thrust of Act 372 of 2023, also sponsored by Sullivan. The law would have given local elected officials the final say over whether to relocate challenged library materials some consider “obscene” and made librarians legally liable for disseminating such materials.
A federal judge temporarily and later permanently blocked portions of Act 372; Attorney General Tim Griffin appealed the ruling in January.

(Forbes Law Offices | Courtesy photo)In the wake of a child sexual and physical abuse scandal at a West Virginia boarding school, the Senate and House of Delegates have been considering two very different pieces of legislation.
A Senate bill, backed by heiress and actress Paris Hilton, sought to prevent child abuse by regulating in-state residential programs and some outdoor programs that often serve children with behavioral issues. 
In the House, a bill would have reduced the timeframe that a civil suit brought by a victim of child sexual assault or abuse could be filed against the state’s insurance program, the Board of Risk and Insurance Management, known as BRIM. 
Miracle Meadows in Salem closed in 2014, and dozens of former students who say they were subjected to horrific abuse began coming forward in 2017, and some civil cases are ongoing. The state could be on the hook for $100 million in settlements paid out by BRIM.
Both bills are unlikely to become law after not going up for a vote in their respective chambers on Wednesday’s Crossover Day deadline.
  Sen. Mike Stuart, R-Kanawha
Senate Judiciary Committee Chair Mike Stuart, who parked Senate Bill 817 — the Paris Hilton bill — in his committee, said the legislation needed more work that couldn’t be completed by the legislative session deadline. 
While the measure would have exempted religious programs from regulation, Stuart said concerns from leaders of religious-based programs about “unintended consequences” had stalled the bill. 
“There were some drawbacks that would have taken a lot of time in committee, especially up against the demands of deadlines,” he said. “It was just more a victim of time than anything [else].”
The bill would require state licensure for private adolescent residential programs and some outdoor or boot camp experience. It also banned the use of physical discipline in these programs and mandated that children have regular, unsupervised video communication with their parents. 
Hilton, who says she was abused in residential treatment facilities as a teen, urged state senators to pass the bill, saying it would establish “essential protections” for children. 
  Sen. Laura Wakim Chapman, R-Ohio
Bill sponsor Sen. Laura Wakim Chapman, R-Ohio, said the bill would close “a hole” in current state law, citing widespread abuse at Miracle Meadows. One lawsuit against the facility on behalf of child victims, which was settled for $50 million, said the children experienced routine beatings and at times were not given toilet paper, requiring them to remain in their own filth.
“Our children have to be protected, and this is one way to protect them,” she said. “This is such a common sense bill.”
West Virginia Watch recently reported that the state has spent $70 million on housing foster children in out-of-state facilities. Chapman said the bill could encourage “good actors” to set up well-regulated, in-state programs to help children with behavioral issues who are now forced out of state. 
“We do need help, and we need to stop shipping our children in crisis out of state,” she said. 
Stuart, who was nominated by President Donald Trump to serve as general counsel for the federal health department, said he’d like to see the bill workshopped during interim meetings ahead of the next year’s legislative session.
“I’m interested in whatever we can do to fix the system,” Stuart said. 
House pauses controversial bill involving child sex abuse victims 
  House Speaker Roger Hanshaw, R-Clay
In the House, a bill sponsored by Speaker Roger Hanshaw would have reduced the window for child victims whose abusers were covered by state insurance to seek relief in civil suits. 
The measure, House Bill 3516, originated in the House Judiciary Committee late last week, raising concerns from House Democrats that the controversial bill had skipped the typical process of how legislation is introduced in the House. 
House leadership decided on Wednesday morning to move the bill to its inactive calendar without explanation. Some members said there wasn’t consensus among Republicans, who hold a super majority in the House, on the measure. 
Hanshaw, R-Clay, said the state has been assessing what types of liabilities BRIM should cover. The lengths of some statutes of limitations — the window when claims can be brought — have caused BRIM rates to rise for entities using the insurance program, including county boards of education and cities. 
The multi-million dollar payouts for Miracle Meadows will be one of the largest liabilities BRIM has had to cover in the last couple of years, Hanshaw said. 
“In consultation with BRIM, we decided it makes sense to start the conversation about just how long we should leave open statutes of limitations on various kinds of claims. This bill is one of them, to make it sound like it’s more than it is. Is, frankly, pretty irresponsible,” Hanshaw said on Monday. 
Current law allows a child victim of sexual abuse and assault 18 years after reaching age 18 to bring a civil claim; the bill would give victims two years after reaching age 18 to file a civil claim if it was against an entity covered by BRIM.
  Del. Shawn Fluharty, D-Ohio
“This legislation is a devastating blow to victims of childhood sexual abuse. We know how difficult it is for survivors to come forward, and how long it can take to process that trauma,” said Del. Shawn Fluharty, D-Ohio in a news release.
The state Democratic Party called the measure a “dangerous and callous attempt to roll back legal protections for survivors of childhood sexual abuse.”
“The timing of this bill is especially egregious in light of the tragedy that was exposed less than two years ago at the Miracle Meadows Boarding School for troubled youth in Salem, West Virginia,” the group said Tuesday in a news release. Thirty-two victims have come forward with abuse allegations against Miracle Meadows. 
Hanshaw said there had been a mischaracterization of what the bill was intended to do.
The bill was not “intended to make life easier for the perpetrators of sexual violence,” he emphasized. There would be no changes to criminal claims or proceedings under the legislation.
“We will punish the perpetrators of horrific violence under the criminal laws of the state of West Virginia, exactly like we always would have,” Hanshaw said.

Democratic Gov. Josh Shapiro signed an executive order last month to attract federal employees to work for the state. 
“The whole intent is that federal workers, or anyone with federal government experience can … get a quick idea of how the application hiring process works in state government, and then see where their experience will help them fit with us,” Miranda Martin, director of talent management for the Office of Administration, said.
The office has directed social media and other digital advertising to federal workers and created a landing page on the state employment website where they can learn about the application process, benefits and see highlighted positions in specialized, hard-to-fill roles, Martin said.
Martin and Philip Glover, national vice president for District 3 of the American Federation of Government Employees, testified about the impacts of unprecedented federal job cuts in a hearing before the House Democratic Policy Committee. AFGE represents about 31,000 federal employees in Pennsylvania.
Since President Donald Trump’s inauguration, the Department of Government Efficiency headed by tech billionaire and Republican megadonor Elon Musk, has indiscriminately fired more than 120,000 workers in massive downsizing and dismantling of federal agencies, CNN reported, citing federal agencies, the Office of Personnel Managment and other news organizations. The layoffs are part of an initiative to cut government spending President Donald Trump initiated on his inauguration day, creating the department by executive order and appointing Musk to lead it.
“I’ve been through six administrations … and I can only say that I have never, ever seen the onslaught against workers, against the union and, frankly, against the services that we provide to the American public,” Glover said.
Pennsylvania has been hit hard and will continue to see impacts of federal downsizing, Glover said. The Social Security Administration, Veterans Administration, Department of Health and Human Services and Department of Defense are all major Pennsylvania employers.
The Trump administration also has eliminated union protection for hundreds of thousands of workers, which unions are fighting, Glover said.
In addition to helping fired federal workers find state jobs, the Pennsylvania Department of Labor and Industry has activated its rapid response program to assist workers in applying for unemployment benefits. More than 500 members of the AFGE have applied, Glover said, noting that as the unions have sued to challenge layoffs some workers have been placed back on the federal payroll.
Rep. Malcolm Kenyatta (D-Philadelphia) asked whether the federal workers who remain in agencies like the Social Security Administration and Veterans Administration would be able to continue to deliver services to people who rely on them.
Glover said programs and workers are being eliminated without regard for the void they will leave.
“They are getting rid of grant programs, willy-nilly, like without any concept of what those programs do for the states, our people are in chaos,” he said.
Using the VA as an example, Glover said veterans who returned from Iraq and Afghanistan with missing limbs will still require prosthetics that the agency may not be able to provide.
“The crux of this is that Pennsylvania, in my mind, is either going to have to pick up these services in some way, which is going to affect your budgets, or those services are just going to not be there for the public,” he said.",https://penncapital-star.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/federalworkers_0-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-04-02 20:06:30.077384

The bill by Pinellas County Republican Berny Jacques (HB 903) addresses a variety of issues involving inmates in Florida’s corrections system, including what happens if acquisition of the drugs needed to put inmates to death becomes “impossible or impractical.” (Some manufacturers have stopped supplying these drugs for executions.)
The state would use by any method not considered unconstitutional.
The bill would require inmates to exhaust all internal administrative remedies before they could sue over conditions. They’d have to show they’d suffered a physical injury or sexual act to bring claims alleging mental or emotional injuries.
Additionally, the bill extends the period for which a court may authorize an inmate to be involuntarily treated from 90 days to six months.
And it exempts from criminal prosecution a prison or jail employee who installs a tracking device on an inmate. The Phoenix reported last year that inmates in at least one correctional institution were required to wear electronic bracelets to monitor their movements.
During a hearing before the House Judiciary Committee on Wednesday, the measure drew criticism from Broward County Democratic Rep. Mike Gottlieb, who objected to language requiring adjudication of indigent inmates’ claims for damages over a negligent or wrongful act or omission to be completed in just one year.
Gottlieb questioned what would happen if the administrative process took longer than a year. “How does that person not lose their ability to sue under this statute?” he asked.
Jacques responded that it was “highly unlikely” the process would take as long as a year. The committee rejected Gottlieb’s subsequent amendment that would have “tolled” or suspended that one-year time limit.
Gottlieb later said he had to vote no on the measure, saying he couldn’t support provisions like placing liens on prisoners who initiate challenges to prison disciplinary reports and the different methods of execution provision.
Orange County Democratic Rep. Johanna López also objected to the execution language.
Jacques replied that the provision would simply allow the state to continue to carry out other constitutionally allowed forms of execution if for whatever reason lethal injection could not be applied.
The measure passed 16-5, along party lines. A companion bill (SB 1604) sponsored by Lee County Republican Jonathan Martin has two more committees to move through before reaching the floor.

(Anna Barrett/Alabama Reflector)A bill that would require local school boards to adopt policies on extending academic credit for “religious instruction” outside the classroom failed an Alabama House committee on Wednesday.
The House Education Policy Committee rejected HB 342, sponsored by Rep. Susan DuBose, R-Hoover, on a 4-9 vote despite significant amendments to the bill that gave local school boards more flexibility with the policy. 
Rep. Terri Collins, R-Decatur, the chair of the committee, said she supported the amendments but said the pushback from both sides was stronger than she expected.

“I had every superintendent around me actually reach out and ask not to,” Collins said in an interview about her vote. “There was just a lot of passion. The amount of people pushing both ways was extreme, more so than I thought, and that makes me hesitant.”
State law currently allows boards of education to extend that credit, but does not mandate released time religious instruction (RTRI), the subject of DuBose’s bill, in which students can take time out of the school day for religious instruction.

The ministry teaches students about the Christian Standard Bible “with a focus on head, heart and hands,” according to its website. In a sample curriculum, it alters the language and organization of Bible lessons so that children can understand it easily. 
Rep. Alan Baker, R-Brewton, also voted against the bill, saying schools can already create religious release time policies. The Legislature passed a law allowing school boards to create a policy in 2019.
“I think the local authorities need to make that decision,” Baker said in an interview. “If they want that there in their system, then they can handle it.”
Collins said she wanted to see more results of the current law. 
“My thought is, we passed it several years ago as a ‘may.’ I would like to see how that works a little bit longer,” she said. 
Rep. Tashina Morris, D-Montgomery, said the program would take away needed instructional time.
“The school hours haven’t changed, but we keep sticking things into the class time,” she said.
DuBose said the bill may come back next year, but start in the Senate.
“People had a difference of opinion. And that happens all the time,” DuBose said in an interview. “I don’t think anything went wrong.”
SB 278, sponsored by Sen. Shay Shelnutt, R-Trussville, is identical to DuBose’s bill with the amendments. It was filed Tuesday and is in the Senate Education Policy Committee.

[&#8230;]","Traffic on Interstate 5 near Olympia. (Bill Lucia/Washington State Standard)Lawmakers in the Washington House and Senate will have plenty of negotiating to do as they try to reconcile competing transportation budget proposals, which both depend on gas tax hikes.
The state House approved its $15.2 billion plan Wednesday, setting the stage for the talks. The legislation differs from the Senate version in significant ways.
First, the Senate’s budget is over $1 billion bigger. 
Second, the Senate has shifted a chunk of spending tied to removing barriers to fish passage out of its purview and over to the capital budget. The House includes nearly $1.2 billion in the next two-year budget to deal with these culverts. The Senate maneuver halves the potential $8 billion shortfall over the next six years. 
And third, while both proposals rely on tax and fee hikes, the mix in each differs.  
The Senate’s plan includes a 6-cent increase in the state’s current 49.4-cent gas tax, with 2% increases each year after to account for inflation. 
The House goes further, looking to raise the state tax 9 cents, and then index it to inflation.
Both hikes would take effect July 1. The Senate gas tax proposal would raise $1.5 billion over the next six years, lawmakers say. The House: $1.8 billion. 
The gas tax increases are not the only ideas in the House and Senate to raise revenue for transportation. 
In the House, the options include a new highway use fee based on fuel efficiency and an increase in the vehicle sales tax. And in the Senate, they include a hike in electric vehicle fees, a new tax on luxury vehicles costing more than $500,000 and a fee for operators of venues with large-scale events. 
The Senate’s revenue package would bring in $3 billion over the next six years. The House’s would raise about $4.4 billion. About $1 billion of that House revenue would be available for the 2025-2027 biennium.
That money would help pay for infrastructure for cars, ferries, bikes and pedestrians. That includes $1.9 billion for ferry operations and capital projects, $900 million for highway preservation and over $300 million for rail and port improvements.
The Senate passed its more than $16 billion transportation budget, as well as its bevy of revenue proposals, over the weekend with some Republican support. The House didn’t act on its tax bill, only passing the budget it would help fund.
The House approved its budget on a 66-30 vote, with a handful of Republican yes votes and a few Democratic dissents.
“The House can look at this proposal and know that this is fiscally conservative,” said Rep. Andrew Barkis, the top Republican on the House Transportation Committee. “This is the proper fiscal approach. This is looking at work within our means, first and foremost.”
Skyrocketing construction costs and slowing gas tax collections have left lawmakers searching for new options for years. They now face a $1 billion shortfall in the next two-year budget. Without new state revenue, they warn of road projects sitting half-built.
Even with more money, the House budget would still punt on $1.3 billion worth of projects between 2025 and 2031. That’s meant tough conversations with some legislators who are unhappy work in their districts won’t get done anytime soon.
“They understand that sometimes you don’t get what you want when you want it, but you have to persist and there will be a payoff at one point in time for being patient,” said Rep. Jake Fey, a Democrat from Tacoma who chairs the House Transportation Committee.
The Senate plan also includes 13 unpaid days in the next fiscal year for state transportation workers, with some exceptions. The House proposal doesn’t use furloughs to save money.
On the House floor Wednesday, lawmakers added a $350 million reserve fund to cover sudden increases in costs for highway maintenance and ferry replacements.
The legislative session is scheduled to end April 27.
“This is a balanced approach,” Fey said. “I’m looking forward to what happens in the future this legislative session, and there’s going to be a lot of hard work.”",https://washingtonstatestandard.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Interstate-5-Traffic-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-04-02 19:04:19.080598

The protest and funeral for The Center was held outside of Parks Library to mourn what students called a safe space on campus, which was restructured to comply with legislation passed last year barring state universities from opening or maintaining DEI offices not required by law or for accreditation.
ISU students and supporters protested the changes before they were implemented, and those who gathered Wednesday honored the lost space said its spirit lives on in those who continue to build up their community and fight for visibility.

Arthur Taylor, a senior studying graphic design at ISU, said without his family backing him and the friends he made through The Center, he’s unsure if he would be here today. That, he said, is why the community created by The Center is so important.
“If I had not come to visit The Center my second semester, I don’t know what I would have done,” Taylor said.
Taylor’s sentiments were shared by a number of others who chose to speak about their time at The Center, whether they utilized it for years or found it just a semester before its restructure. While the physical space is still there and rainbows are still hung on its walls, students said it’s not the same with the name changed and the feeling they got that the university, Iowa Board of Regents and state government is trying to hide their presence on campus.
ISU student Silvera Dudenhoefer said beyond The Center acting as a safe and supportive space for those who needed it, the name made clear that the LGBTQ+ community was to be recognized and respected on campus despite the wishes of some.
“In taking the LGBTQ out of the LGBTQ Center, the Board of Regents and ISU administration has shown us exactly who they’re willing to push to the side in an effort to comply,” Dudenhoefer said.
Members of the queer community deserve to have the freedom to be themselves, Dudenhoefer said, especially in a country that touts personal freedom as a tenet of society. If someone doesn’t conform to the way those in power believe they should be, it’s seemingly acceptable to push them aside so no one has to see them.

“We refuse to stop existing, to stop taking up space and to stop living as we were meant to live — proudly, boldly, openly and queerly,” Dudenhoefer said.
Joining the crowd in its protest was Sen. Herman Quirmbach, D-Ames, who said in comments later echoed in a subcommittee meeting Wednesday afternoon that students must learn about America’s history with the civil rights movement, women’s suffrage and more to examine their causes and how progress was achieved in order to solve the problems of today.

The New Mexico Health Care Authority said in a news release the collaborative is “designed to improve mental health services, reduce disparities and strengthen access to behavioral health across communities.”
Lessons learned from the initiative by New Mexico officials will “help promote and support community engagement, identify and address barriers preventing meaningful participation.”
State lawmakers put a focus on behavioral health treatment during the first half of New Mexico’s legislative session that ended March 22, and Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham signed two pieces of legislation into law that will create a “behavioral health executive committee” to coordinate treatment statewide by assessing local needs and make it easier for providers to pay for treatment using Medicaid.
Under the new law, the HCA is responsible for administering the funding that will pay for behavioral health programs. Source NM has a pending inquiry to the HCA if the new collaborative will connect with the agency’s responsibilities under the new law. 
The collaborative is being organized by the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration, the federal agency devoted to addressing addiction and mental health issues which oversees the 988 Lifeline and conducts the annual National Survey on Drug Use and Health.
Only 34.8% of people in New Mexico with private insurance were able to get mental health care in 2021, along with about half of people on Medicaid, according to a review of data collected by SAMHSA.
SAMHSA is among the federal agencies that is facing mass layoffs and cutting grants to states as part of the Trump administration’s “realigning” of the federal Department of Health and Human Services.
Nick Boukas, director of Health Care Authority’s Behavioral Health Services Division, said in the news release that improving behavioral health systems starts with listening to communities.
“By engaging our staff in opportunities like this, we create solutions that are not only effective but rooted in the realities and needs of the people we serve,” Boukas said in a statement.

(Photo by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement via Getty Images)Dauphin County Board Chairman Justin Douglas says the Trump administration Wednesday should end the deportation of Bhutanese residents. 
Since President Donald Trump took office, Dauphin County officials say as many as 18 Bhutanese residents who legally immigrated to the U.S. as refugees may have been deported back to the country where many fled ethnic cleansing. Alyson Wert, a spokesperson for Douglas, said three lived in the county.
“We owe it to these individuals and to the promise we’ve made as a nation committed to protecting the vulnerable,” Douglas said at a Dauphin County Commission meeting on Wednesday. “We have a moral and legal obligation not to return refugees to a country that once ethnically cleansed them. …  Some may say this is political, but for me it’s about people. It’s about my constituents. “
As of April 1, at least four of the deportees appear to have been arrested in Nepal while attempting to contact family members in refugee camps there. Fourteen were unaccounted for, at this point. Douglas said at least nine other Bhutanese Pennsylvanians have been detained.
Central Pennsylvania is home to the largest population of Bhutanese Nepali refugees in the country. In the last decades, tens of thousands of them were welcomed into the U.S. as refugees following ethnic cleansing of Nepalese-speaking minorities in Bhutan. Many settled around Harrisburg which has a Bhutanese Nepali population estimated in the tens of thousands.
All of the Bhutanese residents detained or deported by ICE appear to be men, and at least some had criminal charges that Douglas and family members describe as “minor.” 
He said the impact of the arrests has reverberated across the Bhutanese community.
“The community right now is living in uncertainty, unsure of who might be targeted next,” Douglas said. “Yes, these individuals may have minor criminal histories, which enabled ICE to attempt to remove them from the United States. But that is no reason to rip them away from their wives, children, brothers, sisters and community.”
The detentions have caught the attention of Pennsylvania lawmakers at both the state and federal level.
Democratic state lawmakers representing  Dauphin County in Harrisburg have spoken out against the arrests. On March 29, U.S. Congressman Scott Perry (R-Dauphin), a supporter of Trump’s hardline immigration policies generally, said on social media  that he met with Bhutanese community members in Harrisburg.

(Photo by Markus Schmidt/Virginia Mercury) In a dramatic but ultimately symbolic show of defiance, Virginia House Democrats on Wednesday tried — and failed — to override 13 of Gov. Glenn Youngkin’s vetoes from this year’s legislative session, knowing full well the numbers were never in their favor. 
Youngkin, a Republican, rejected 157 of the 915 measures sent to his desk by the Democratic-controlled General Assembly in February, flexing his veto pen more aggressively than any Virginia governor in decades. 
But with Democrats holding only narrow majorities — 51-49 in the House and 21-19 in the Senate — their chances of reversing any of those decisions were always slim. Overriding a gubernatorial veto in Virginia requires a two-thirds vote in both chambers.
Still, Wednesday’s veto session was less about math and more about momentum in a pivotal election year. With every seat in the House of Delegates on the ballot and a gubernatorial race already underway, Democrats used the day to draw sharp contrasts with the Republican agenda — and with the party’s standard bearer, President Donald Trump.
Nearly every Democratic lawmaker who rose to speak did so with a common refrain, casting House Republicans as “terrified of Trump” and unwilling to stand up for Virginia values — from voting rights and gun safety to fair wages and union rights. 
 Bid to ban assault-style weapons falls short

While the Senate declined to take up any of the vetoed bills, House Democrats fell short in their attempt to override Youngkin’s veto of a bill restricting assault-style firearms. The 50-46 party-line vote was a setback for legislation central to Virginia’s ongoing gun debate.
House Bill 1607, identical to Senate Bill 1181, would have made it a Class 1 misdemeanor to import, sell, or transfer assault-style firearms, with exceptions for antiques, inoperable or manually operated guns, and those made before July 1, 2025. It also barred those under 21 from possessing such firearms and banned high-capacity magazines.
Del. Dan Helmer, D-Fairfax, a combat veteran and the bill’s sponsor, defended it as a public safety measure.
“These weapons were designed for the battlefield, not for our streets,” Helmer said. “They have no place in Virginia. Our law enforcement officers work tirelessly to keep our community safe … The least we can do is to support them.”
He accused GOP lawmakers of bowing to special interests: “Once again, the Republicans’ priorities are not the priorities of Virginia’s working families. They are too terrified of Donald Trump to act to remove weapons of war from our communities.”
Del. Nick Freitas, R-Culpeper, also a veteran, pushed back, saying the bill would punish law-abiding citizens.
“I also carried weapons overseas in combat situations, and I don’t recall once when I was either conducting combat operations (or) any part in the oath I swore to the Constitution to then be able to come back, sit in this legislature and deprive American citizens of their constitutionally protected rights to defend themselves.”
 Protecting voting rights

The House also came up short in an effort to override Youngkin’s veto of HB 1657, a bill that would have required the Department of Elections to complete any large-scale voter roll removals at least 90 days before any primary or general election — a safeguard currently in place only for federal races.
Mirroring SB 813, the measure permitted removals in cases of death, felony conviction, mental incapacity, or at the voter’s request — all allowed under current law. It also would have extended the time registrars have to process cancellations from 30 to 60 days and doubled the response window for voters flagged over citizenship concerns from 14 to 28 days.
“The right to vote is sacred as the cornerstone of our democracy and the foundations of our commonwealth,” said Del. Rozia Henson, D-Woodbridge, the bill’s sponsor. “To have a person’s voting rights stripped away so close to an election is simply something that you cannot fathom.”
Henson added, “Let me be clear, if you are ineligible to vote, you simply cannot vote, but it is also the law that voters cannot be systematically purged at the whim of the governor. Yet time and time and time again, Republicans have shown that they’re too scared of Donald Trump to stand up for our democracy and too afraid to protect the right to vote.”
A similar fate befell HB 2002, which sought to limit local registrars to canceling voter registrations only based on data from the Department of Elections or approved state agencies — unless a voter submitted a written request to cancel their own registration.
The bill also aimed to reinstate protections for active-duty military members, Americans temporarily overseas and their families, ensuring their registrations couldn’t be canceled while they remained eligible.
“In Virginia we believe in fair, secure, and accessible elections,” said Del. Amy Laufer, D-Albemarle, the bill’s sponsor. “We have a duty to ensure that our elections are secure without undermining the fundamental right to vote, and we cannot allow outside influences or partisan games to threaten that sacred right.”
 Minimum wage hike fails

An attempt by House Democrats to override Youngkin’s veto of a proposed minimum wage increase also fell short.
HB 1928, sponsored by Del. Jeion Ward, D-Hampton, outlined a phased wage hike — codifying the already-scheduled increase to $12.41 per hour on Jan. 1, 2025, followed by raises to $13.50 in 2026 and $15.00 by 2027.
Ward framed the legislation as essential to working families. “Raising a minimum wage is about people, it’s about families struggling to keep lights on,” she said. “It’s about parents working double shifts to afford childcare. And it’s about the workers who keep Virginia running, but they are still left behind.”
But Republicans pushed back, arguing the bill would backfire on the very people it intended to help.
“What your bill actually does is make it illegal to hire someone at a certain amount,” Freitas said. “There’s no such thing as just one minimum wage, there is always two. There is the arbitrary wage that you set, and then there is $0. And a lot of people are going to end up getting $0.”
He warned that higher wage mandates could eliminate jobs altogether: “You don’t just lift people up to a higher wage.”
 Marijuana justice efforts stalls

Another proposal — HB 2555 — which would have offered sentencing relief for individuals convicted of marijuana-related felonies, also failed to clear the hurdle of a veto override.
The bill would have granted automatic hearings to those still incarcerated or under supervision as of July 1, 2025 for marijuana offenses committed before legalization in 2021.
The bill recognized Virginia’s shift in marijuana laws and aimed to provide relief for people still serving time for outdated crimes. But Youngkin, in his veto statement, argued that the bill went too far by potentially benefiting individuals convicted of serious crimes.
“While framed as a measure for non-violent offenders,” he wrote, “this bill would allow sentence reductions for individuals convicted of serious crimes, including those involving fentanyl distribution, sales to minors, and violent offenses where marijuana was a factor.”
He also warned of broader consequences for the justice system. “The proposal places an undue burden on courts, prosecutors, and victims,” Youngkin stated, “requiring hearings even for those whose sentences were enhanced by prior marijuana convictions but were primarily convicted of far more serious offenses.”
Henson, who sponsored the legislation, defended the bill as a matter of justice. 
“We came a long way in legalizing marijuana,” he said. “The question is why are they afraid to give someone a second chance?”
“Justice is supposed to be about balance,” Henson added. “We have people convicted of marijuana-related offenses still suffering, even though what they did is no longer against the law. This bill gave a chance to make things right.”
 No strengthening of union rights

Lastly, the House was unable to secure enough votes to override the governor’s veto of HB 2764, which would have allowed collective bargaining for Virginia’s public employees.
The measure aimed to repeal the state’s ban on public-sector union negotiations and create a Public Employee Relations Board to oversee the process for state and local workers.
The bill required good-faith bargaining over wages, hours and working conditions, and removed a provision mandating secret ballots in union elections — a change critics said could compromise employee privacy.
In his veto statement, Youngkin called the proposal a major policy shift that would “threaten the funding and delivery of critical state and local services” and cost taxpayers “hundreds of millions of dollars a year.” He also criticized the lack of a funding plan, saying agencies were unprepared for the legal and administrative demands.
Del. Kathy Tran, D-Fairfax, the bill’s sponsor, said the measure was about standing with workers. 
“Virginia has an opportunity to lead,” she said. “We can demonstrate that we value our workers … by giving them a seat at the table and (improving) our services.”

(Commonwealth Media Services)A few hours before President Donald Trump’s announcements of another round on tariffs, Gov. Josh Shapiro described it as a “disastrous, reckless policy.” He expressed his concern about the impact it would have on businesses and consumers in the state during a visit to a brewery in the Lehigh Valley.
“I’m mindful that we are here today in Bethlehem, on the same day that the federal government is about to impose massive tariffs across the board, and I’m worried about the impacts on Pennsylvania businesses once those tariffs hit and other countries then hit us back with retaliatory tariffs,” Shapiro said Wednesday at Fegley’s Bethlehem Brew Works.
For weeks, Trump has been teasing April 2 for his administration’s announcement on taxing imported products from around the world.
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
Shapiro described the expected tariffs on aluminum and other products from Canada by the Trump administration as a “tax” that would increase prices for consumers and businesses.
“Listen, this is not hard to understand,” Shapiro said. “You do not need a degree in economics in order to make sense of what is about to occur.”
Shapiro specifically highlighted the potential impact on Main Streets across the commonwealth. That included 530 craft breweries, which make Pennsylvania the second-largest craft beer producer in the nation. He said the industry generates $5.4 billion in annual economic impact for the state.
Fegley’s Brew Works was established in 1998 in Bethlehem. Jeff Fegley, the owner of the brewery, said there’s “great concerns” about the impact that tariffs will have on his business.
“What’s going on right now with the economy, the future of the economy, and specifically these tariffs, which are a concern for small businesses like myself and for many,” Fegley said. “And it’s a big unknown as to what’s going to happen, how that’s going to affect them. We have ingredients that come from Canada and other things that are sourced that potentially are going to be increasing overnight.”
Wednesday was the latest stop for Shapiro across Pennsylvania, speaking out against the Trump administration’s tariff policy. The day before, he was in Mifflin County making the case how tariffs would hurt the timber industry.
“I just wish the president wasn’t working against us as recklessly as he is,” Shapiro said Wednesday. “This tariff war that he is starting, this button that he is pushing is going to have one effect, and that effect is to drive up costs on consumers and businesses throughout Pennsylvania at a time where we can’t afford that, and it’s going to make our lives way more difficult.”

During Trump’s successful 2024 campaign, the GOP presidential nominee argued implementing tariffs would help boost American manufacturing and help prevent the flow of fentanyl into the United States.
“What I’ve seen over the first 70 days of his administration is chaos that has resulted in higher prices, fewer rights and more worry from so many people that I meet all across Pennsylvania,” Shapiro said.
As an example, Shapiro referenced the negative effects of tariffs during Trump’s first term on the hardwood industry he believes is proof it would not achieve what the president said he is setting out to do.
“We have seen enough from him over his first four years and over these first 70 days, the chaos, the confusion, the higher prices to know that the direction he’s heading in right now is really reckless and really dangerous,” Shapiro said.
Shapiro claimed the way to “spur American manufacturing” was by investing in businesses, the workforce, schools, and STEM education in the United States, while also “not eviscerating the Department of Human Services.”",https://penncapital-star.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/27523_gov_tariffs_10-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-04-02 19:04:19.080598

Greg Gianforte. Gianforte, a Republican, earlier described it as a “tool tax,” and members of the agricultural and business communities spoke in support of it at a hearing. Sen. Josh Kassmier, R-Fort [&#8230;]","A tractor harvests sugar beets in this aerial photo near Sidney, Montana (Photo by Larry Mayer | Getty Images). On a bipartisan vote Tuesday, the Montana Senate approved a bill to increase the business equipment tax exemption rate, a priority for Gov. Greg Gianforte.
Gianforte, a Republican, earlier described it as a “tool tax,” and members of the agricultural and business communities spoke in support of it at a hearing.
Sen. Josh Kassmier, R-Fort Benton, sponsored Senate Bill 322, which he described as a simple bill that offers tax relief to small businesses.
The bill will expand the tax exemption to cover business equipment with a market value of as much as $3 million instead of the current $1 million limit.
Kassmier said an estimated 700 businesses will come off the tax rolls as a result.
“Anytime you allow these small businesses in your community to invest in their businesses in their communities, it grows the local economies,” Kassmier said.
The bill passed a key floor vote Tuesday on a 39-11 count with little debate, and with both Republicans and Democrats in support and in opposition.
It earned significant support in the Senate Tax committee as well, with seven legislators in favor and just one opposed.
But some of the resistance it met was due to another priority for both Republicans and Democrats this session — a property tax cut for residential payers.
“This is a time we don’t need to be giving exemptions, when we need to be giving relief to residential property taxpayers,” said Sen. Mary Ann Dunwell, D-Helena, in committee, opposing the bill.
A fiscal analysis of the bill said it reimburses lost revenue to local government jurisdictions and the Montana University System from the general fund to the tune of an estimated $11 million a biennium.
However, the fiscal analysis also said school district mills are not reimbursed and will have tax shifts associated with them. It estimated a $1.3 million decrease for schools.
In committee, Dunwell asked how much more residential and commercial “main street” entities would pay in the shift — “in addition to the huge historic increases they’ve seen” the last couple of reappraisal cycles.
The Montana Department of Revenue’s Dylan Cole said the changes are “not gigantic,” an estimated taxable value drop of 0.35% for school districts. The increase would depend on how much business equipment property is in a district.
“But on average, people’s tax bills will be about 0.35% higher as a result of this,” Cole said.
Rose Bender, with the Montana Budget and Policy Center, said the cut comes on top of a history of decreasing rates and increasing exemptions for business equipment.
In 1989, business equipment tax was cut from 11% to 9%, and it’s been cut repeatedly since, said Bender, in opposition to the bill.
Bender said that rate dropped to 1.5% in 2013 for business equipment valued from $100,000 to $6 million.
The exemption hit $1 million in 2023, a tripling from 2021, and the current proposal would triple it again, Bender said.
A look at the groups that are paying property taxes shows business equipment used to pay 15% of the pie in 1995, and now it pays less than 5%, she said.
But residential payers are in a group that went from paying 38% of all property taxes to paying more than 57% in the same period, Bender said.
Margie MacDonald, with Big Sky 55+, said if the state has those extra millions in its budget, she had some ideas besides help for businesses.
MacDonald, who expressed “soft” opposition to the bill, said the money could help working parents, buy down interest rates to build housing that nurses and teachers can afford — or provide relief for “skyrocketing residential property tax and rents.”
Most members of the public spoke in support of the bill, however, including many connected to agriculture.
The Montana Agricultural Business Association, Montana Chamber of Commerce, Montana Economic Development Association, Montana Building Industry Association, Montana Taxpayers Association, and others supported the bill.
John Semple, with the Montana Grain Growers Association, said the bill would allow his members to put more money back into farming endeavors.
“Most of our equipment that we use to raise a crop costs quite a bit of money,” Semple said.
Earlier this month at a press conference, Gianforte said the bill should be a priority if Montanans are serious about addressing the affordability crisis.
“We should call this tax what it is, it’s a tool tax,” Gianforte said. “It’s an annual sales tax on equipment, and it never goes away.”
He said the bill would allow family farms and ranches to invest in their operations instead of repeatedly paying the state for their own equipment.
“For farmers, it’s a tax on tractors and a tax on combines,” Gianforte said. “For dentists and doctors, it’s a tax on machines, and even their instruments.
“For restaurant owners, it’s a tax on grills, and even knives, forks, and spoons. For a carpenter, welder, plumber, or homebuilder, it’s a tax on their tools.”
The Governor’s Office said previous bills in 2021 and 2023, also sponsored by Kassmier and signed by Gianforte, expanded the exemption from $100,000 to $1 million, “eliminating the business equipment tax burden for more than 5,000 small businesses, farms, and ranches.”
In a video posted on the governor’s site, farmer Brent Hanford from Fort Benton said the increase to the exemption makes sense for family farms.
Hanford said one tractor alone can cost half a million dollars, and a new combine with an attachment can cost $700,000.
“Two pieces of equipment will get you over one million bucks in a hurry,” Hanford said.
One Democrat, Sen. Ellie Boldman of Missoula, signed onto the bill as a sponsor, as did four other Republicans, Sens. Butch Gillespie of Ethridge, Wendy McKamey of Great Falls, Gayle Lammers of Hardin, and Rep. Randyn Gregg of White Sulphur Springs.

Gov. Mike Dunleavy could hire an aide in the governor’s office who is knowledgeable in Alaska agriculture to work with the existing staff in the Department of Natural Resources. The goal should be to craft a plan to increase agriculture on a statewide basis to submit to the next legislative session.
Existing agricultural policies are Railbelt-centric and need to be designed to address food security statewide. The greatest need is in rural areas off the road system where food costs are very high. Particular attention needs to be paid to the small communities in the Yukon and Kuskokwim river deltas, which are suffering from major losses of subsistence resources.
The successes of hydroponic gardening in the state need to be examined along with the experiences of gardens in roadless communities.
Some small rural communities have achieved great success in food security and even are supplying others with fresh produce year-round.
Take Old Harbor, a small Native village on Kodiak Island. With three high hoop greenhouses, raised beds, and multiple hydroponic systems, the Sitkalidak Sunrise Farm grows rainbow chard, cabbage, potatoes, celery, romaine, radishes, tomatoes, beans, peas, cucumbers, onions, green peppers, many varieties of squashes and more. The farm also has some fruit production, including a few beautiful cherry, apple, pears, kiwi and plum trees producing in one of the hoop houses.
The community also has a herd of buffalo purchased from a Kodiak Island rancher. Three young buffalo bulls recently were obtained from a Native American tribe in Montana to strengthen the genetic pool of a herd of 70 animals. Sitkalidak plans to add pigs and chickens.
Children play a key role in farming activities. Sales to other communities are planned.
Tyonek, a small Native community on the western shore of Cook Inlet, even produced the first Alaska-grown watermelon.
Tyonek Grown is designed to enhance food security and provide fresh organic vegetables to community members. The garden has grown into a 1.5-acre operation with two high tunnels —± 48 feet by 22 feet — solar-powered irrigation and ventilation systems, 15 raised beds, over 2,000 row feet of potatoes and mixed vegetable crops, perennial fruits, and plans for expansion in the coming years.
Like Old Harbor, Tyonek has incorporated children in farming operations to create long-term community interest in the project. Surplus production is sold in Anchorage.
The biggest rural farm is in Bethel. Meyers Farm grew from a small family farm into an operation that supplies Bethel, Nome, numerous Western Alaska villages, and some more distant schools like Cordova on a year-round basis. Some produce also is sold in Anchorage and other communities.
Tim Meyers stripped off the tundra on a couple of acres to allow the ground to thaw and composted the tundra for his gardens. “I just tilled up the ground, and everything grew,” Meyers told the Anchorage Daily News.
Here’s how the ADN described Meyers’ operation: A vacuum system sucks seeds through tiny holes he drilled in baking sheets to land in their assigned cell in planting trays. A potato-planting contraption that he made features a spot for Lisa, his wife, to sit as she drops plants into holes being punched at the same time an irrigation drip line is laid down. Then everything is buried, all in one pass. An Amish-built machine lets them plant 1,000 vegetable starts in an hour.
The Meyers Farm includes numerous raised beds, high hoop greenhouses and a massive underground storage area, which stays at 31 degrees Fahrenheit in the winter and is a little warmer in the summer. In addition Western Alaska communities and Anchorage, The farm also sells to schools located in Cordova, King Cove, Sand Point and Naknek.
Recent hydroponics efforts on the Kenai Peninsula have shown promise and drawn praise from residents. Edgy Veggies and fresh365 located in Soldotna are producing vegetables year-round, but both say summer sales are slow, as many locals produce vegetables in home gardens. Winter sales are strong. Power costs are high though.
There are several gardening initiatives led by Native organizations throughout Western Alaska. Budget cuts in the U.S. Department of Agriculture may impede these efforts.

Six Colorado State University students have had their visas revoked, according to university spokesperson Tiana Kennedy. The university encouraged all students with concerns to contact their home country embassy as well as the CSU Office of International Programs. CSU initially reported five students affected on Tuesday, but the university learned of one more overnight.

The University of Colorado said the U.S. Department of Homeland Security revoked student visas, known as F-1 Visas, for four students at its Boulder and Colorado Springs campuses. 
“At CU we are focused on supporting the success of all of our students, including international students,” the university said in a statement. “Each one of our students are seeking to advance their careers and the lives of their families, and we understand the anxieties that visa revocations cause to impacted students.”
CSU and CU declined to provide additional information to protect the privacy of affected students.
It is not clear why the Colorado students had their visas revoked, but President Donald Trump issued an executive order targeting student visas of those who participated in pro-Palestinian protests on college campuses. 
U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement arrested Mahmoud Khalil, a Columbia University graduate student with a green card, making him a legal permanent resident, in March after he helped organize a protest calling for a ceasefire in the Israel-Hamas war in Gaza. 
Administration officials have claimed, without evidence, that he is actively supporting Hamas, which is designated as a terrorist organization and which attacked Israel in 2023, killing about 1,200 people, mostly civilians, sparking Israel’s war that has killed more than 40,000 people in Gaza.
Representatives for Metropolitan State University, Colorado Mesa University, Colorado Mountain College and Western Colorado University said they have not had students affected by visa revocations as of Wednesday, though they are monitoring the situation.

Teresa Ibach of Sumner speaks on the legislative floor on Tuesday, May 16, 2023, in Lincoln, Neb. (Zach Wendling/Nebraska Examiner)LINCOLN — A bill to exempt feedlots from Nebraska branding and inspection fees is headed to the second round of legislative debate after Wednesday’s 26-2 vote. 
After hours of debate, State Sen. Teresa Ibach of Sumner, in west-central Nebraska, amended Legislative Bill 646 to cap the amount the Brand Committee can charge feedlots and seek to exempt feedlots in the state’s brand inspection area from paying branding-related fees. It would replace them with a one-time payment of $500 to apply for feedlots to get an exempt status. The bill also exempts dairy cattle. 
“I think this is good legislation,” Ibach said. “This will be a good thing going forward.” 
Ibach said she is open to additional amendments to her priority bill regarding the language of the fee structure and other technical issues lawmakers might have. She faced opposition from State Sen. Tanya Storer of Whitman, a freshman rural lawmaker from north-central Nebraska, who proposed an amendment to essentially kill the bill—an effort that failed Wednesday while urban lawmakers chose not to weigh in. 
Storer has expressed concerns about lawmakers making an uninformed decision about the agency responsible for investigating cattle theft and verifying ownership through branding when cattle are bought, sold, or moved in and out of the brand zone established by state law, which essentially covers the western two-thirds of the state. She also said the agency could not fund itself after the change. 
The Nebraska Brand Committee is funded entirely through fees, not by taxpayers. If Ibach’s bill passes, the committee would lose $1.6 million annually, roughly 25% of its operating budget, according to the bill’s fiscal note.

“This is a major technical change to Nebraska’s brand act that addresses oversight and law enforcement for our number one cash commodity,” Storer said on the floor Wednesday. 
Storer said cattle are an essential economic engine for the state, and that she is trying to protect the integrity of the Nebraska Brand Committee. State Sens. Mike Jacobson of North Platte said the proposed change would be a “big shock to the system.”
State Sen. Ben Hansen of Blair said the agricultural industry is too important for Nebraska to continue having routine fights over branding. 
“I’ve listened to the same argument every year for seven years,” Hansen said. “It is time we act.”  
The rural divide between lawmakers is quite rare. While Democratic lawmakers have led many bill debates in this legislative session, Republicans mostly led the discussion about Ibach’s bill. Most urban and Democratic-aligned lawmakers didn’t weigh in, but some asked questions about the state’s quirky branding law. State Sen. Wendy DeBoer of Bennington, for example, asked Ibach and Storer about the budget of the Brand Committee.
Other cattle-feeding states, including Texas and Oklahoma, deal with cattle branding differently. Branding isn’t mandatory in those states but is encouraged to deter theft, while brand inspections are mandatory in Wyoming and Colorado. Hansen hinted that Nebraska should be more like Texas. 
Nebraska is the second-largest cattle-producing state in the U.S., generating $13.2 billion from cattle and other livestock, according to the Nebraska Department of Agriculture. The Nebraska Brand Committee regulates parts of that industry.
The Nebraska Farm Bureau and Nebraska Brand Committee lost Wednesday’s rural political battle, while the Nebraska Cattlemen were on the winning side. The Brand Committee called the legislation an attempt to “severely” weaken the cattle industry’s checks and balances. The Farm Bureau, in a statement, said“the Committee should have the fee authority necessary to adequately fund its programs.”
The Cattlemen’s Board of Directors initially opposed LB 646 but voted to support the amended bill on Tuesday, saying it’s “time to stop kicking the can down the road on critical brand law reforms in the state of Nebraska.”
Sen. Barry DeKay of Niobrara said regardless of what the statehouse does, some in the cattle industry will be upset. 
“Either way, this would be a civil war in Nebraska,” Dekay said.

(Courtesy of Rhode Island Department of Transportation)Rhode Island’s statewide bus network already allows some commuter rail pass holders to ride its buses for free, but one lawmaker is making his annual push to take that integration with the Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority (MBTA) even further.
Legislation sponsored by Rep. John Lombardi, a Providence Democrat, would enable the Rhode Island Public Authority (RIPTA) to collaborate with the MBTA so all passes work on the Ocean State’s bus network — and vice versa. 
Lombardi’s bill received its initial hearing before the House Committee on Corporations, where it was held for further study as is standard procedure.
“This is a cost-saving consumer protection measure for people in the less affluent communities of Rhode Island,” Lombardi told the committee. “This just makes sense.”
Allowing dual passes would also allow the state to meet one of the major planks of its Transit Forward RI 2040 plan, which envisions expanded and accessible service across the region.
But RIPTA doesn’t need legislation to collaborate with its Boston-based counterpart. Commuters who have monthly train passes to ride out of Wickford Junction, T.F. Green International Airport, and Providence and Pawtucket’s MBTA stations can already ride Rhode Island’s bus network for no extra charge.
Passes for those zones are also available in Kingston, Massachusetts, and the communities of East Taunton, Fall River, Middleboro, and New Bedford — where stations opened this March for the new South Coast Rail line.
Agency spokesperson Sara Furbush said RIPTA is already in communication with the MBTA about exploring more opportunities to make more Massachusetts-based transit passes available for use in Rhode Island.
“That said, we appreciate the support and visibility,” she said in an email to Rhode Island Current about Lombardi’s proposal. “Expanding this type of fare integration and making dual passes more widely available is something we would like to see become a reality.”
This is the ninth consecutive session that Lombardi has pitched which he calls a way to push for more collaboration. Since 2017, his bill has never been voted out of committee.
“It is what it is, but I’ll keep doing it until I hear different,” Lombardi said in an interview Wednesday. “I never hear opposition, so I don’t know what the problem is.”
No one spoke in person on Lombardi’s bill during Wednesday’s committee hearing, but 10 people did submit written testimony in favor of the proposal.
“Transportation options such as rail and bus are vitally important to Rhode Islanders who do not own a vehicle,” wrote Matt Netto, associate state director for AARP Rhode Island. “These modes of transportation increase access and convenience for all looking to travel throughout Rhode Island and Massachusetts.”
Longtime transit advocate and former RIPTA board member Barry Schiller did offer an amendment to the bill on behalf of Rhode Island Transit Riders. He called on state transportation officials to collaborate not just with the MBTA, but also Amtrak and other regional transit authorities in Massachusetts — all would need to report back to legislative leaders by Jan. 1, 2026.
MBTA spokesperson Lisa Battison told Rhode Island Current the agency is always happy to work with RIPTA “in best serving the riding public.”

,DC,2025-04-02 22:08:32+00:00,News From The States - Fair. Fearless. Free.,"U.S. House Dems say NOAA cuts will harm weather forecasting, fisheries, Navy operations",Jacob Fischler,,,,,https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/us-house-dems-say-noaa-cuts-will-harm-weather-forecasting-fisheries-navy-operations,,"Democrats on the U.S. House Natural Resources Committee and a panel of experts on Wednesday blasted the Trump administration’s reduction to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration’s budget and workforce, citing consequences for everyday weather data, national security and affected industries.Virtually every American interacts with NOAA’s weather data, which supplies forecasting services across the country.The agency’s climate and oceanic research supports the U.S. Navy’s operations and even the commercial fishing industry – described during the forum as having “a love-hate relationship” with the agency – depends on NOAA to open and close fisheries, the lawmakers and experts said.But those missions were imperiled in February by the firings of 7% of NOAA’s staff of scientists and others overseeing federal research and monitoring of weather and oceans, the group of Democrats said.“These critical functions are being dismantled by the sweeping, indiscriminate layoffs of nonpartisan public servants and facility closures,” U.S. Rep. Seth Magaziner, a Rhode Island Democrat who led the forum, said.The reductions in force at NOAA, which houses agencies including the National Weather Service, National Ocean Service, National Marine Fisheries Service, National Environmental Satellite, Data, and Information Service and the Office of Oceanic and Atmospheric Research, were part of across-the-board cuts to the federal workforce sought by President Donald Trump and billionaire White House adviser Elon Musk.The group of Democrats, who met without involvement of the committee’s Republican majority, said the cuts would hurt a wide range of Americans who depend on the agency’s data collection and rulemaking.Data collection and disseminationOne of NOAA’s core missions is collecting and publishing weather data across the country used in forecasting apps and other common sources of weather information.“There is no weather forecast that's produced in this country that isn't dependent on NOAA, none” Mary Glackin, a former deputy under secretary for operations at the agency under presidents of both parties, said.The availability of federal data made possible the creation of companies like Accuweather, which started by collecting data in a garage, Glackin said.U.S. Navy Rear Admiral Jon White told the panel NOAA’s extensive forecasting data was also critical to naval operations, saying reductions in that data would hurt the military’s readiness, both shipping out of domestic stations and in potential conflict zones.“Hurricane forecasting and typhoon forecasting rely on the data from NOAA, whether it's satellite data,” White said. “Reductions in that data and that information provide critical threats to our military infrastructure. Ships that (start) out of Norfolk and San Diego rely on that information about upcoming storms, especially hurricanes on the East Coast. … It's not just billions of dollars of ship damage: It's lives that are at stake.”Industry needs NOAAMagaziner was the one who called the commercial fishing industry’s connection with NOAA “a love-hate relationship,” but he and witnesses noted that the agency oversees the most basic functions the industry needs to operate.Sarah Schumann, a fisherman with operations in Rhode Island and Alaska, criticized President Joe Biden’s administration for allying too strongly with offshore wind developers, but said the new administration’s actions were also detrimental to the industry.“These cuts will bog down the agency's ability to serve the public for fishermen,” Schumann said. “Because of climate change, we desperately need faster, more nimble and more collaborative data collection and decision-making, and there is a very slim chance we're going to get that with this.”Trump’s slowdown of regulations – requiring federal agencies to withdraw 10 regulations for every one new regulation put into place – has also hampered commercial fishing operations.Opening and closing fisheries for a season are done through NOAA rulemaking, environmental attorney Lizzie Lewis told the panel. Bluefin tuna fisheries were not closed on time and were overfished by 125% and fisheries in New England are unlikely to open on time, she said.Efficiency?The cuts, part of Musk’s initiative to make government more efficient, are not having their intended effect in streamlining government, Magaziner and others on the panel, including New Mexico’s Melanie Stansbury, said.“The assertion that mass layoffs will somehow improve efficiency is not only misleading, it is outright dangerous,” Magaziner said. “Real people, real jobs and real lives are on the line. Without NOAA’s real-time data,  emergency responders are left without the critical information they need to respond to impending disasters like wildfires, hurricanes, floods and severe storms putting millions at risk.”The layoffs also decimated morale at the agency and made attracting qualified young people to its public service mission more difficult, Lewis told the panel.“We are losing an entire generation of scientists and leaders who can help this country,” Lewis said. “We can keep its people safe and can grow its economy. And that to me is the devastating human cost.”",,,,2025-04-02 19:04:19.080598

Free.,Senate GOP budget resolution sets stage for raising debt limit by as much as $5 trillion,Jennifer Shutt,,,,,https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/senate-gop-budget-resolution-sets-stage-raising-debt-limit-much-5-trillion,,"WASHINGTON — U.S. Senate Republicans released an updated budget resolution Wednesday that sets a May 9 deadline for more than a dozen committees to approve their slice of the massive package that will permanently extend the GOP tax cuts and make significant reductions in spending.The 70-page budget resolution, however, includes different guidelines for the House and Senate committees, allowing GOP leaders to sidestep their differences on policy for the moment, but not the long haul.The budget resolution also sets the stage for the House to raise the debt limit by $4 trillion and the Senate to lift it by not more than $5 trillion in the reconciliation package.Senate Budget Committee Chairman Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., wrote in a statement that final approval of the budget resolution would “unlock the ability for the appropriate Senate committees to fully fund our border needs for four years, provide much-needed financial relief to our military at a time of great danger, make the 2017 tax cuts permanent to energize the economy, and do what has been promised for decades: go through every line item of the budget to cut wasteful and unnecessary spending — hopefully by the trillions.”Senate Majority Leader John Thune, R-S.D., released a statement of his own, saying the “parliamentarian has reviewed the Budget Committee’s substitute amendment and deemed it appropriate for consideration under the Budget Act.”“It is now time for the Senate to move forward with this budget resolution in order to further advance our shared Republican agenda in Congress,” Thune wrote.The Senate parliamentarian is the nonpartisan scorekeeper who ensures everything included in a reconciliation bill meets the chamber’s strict rules.Here comes the vote-a-ramaThe complicated reconciliation process will allow the GOP to approve its core policy goals without needing support from Democrats in the Senate, where 60 votes are usually needed to advance legislation. Reconciliation does, however, come with several hoops to jump through.One of those hurdles will come later this week when the Senate endures the dreaded vote-a-rama; a marathon amendment voting session that typically lasts overnight. After that, senators will be able to send the budget resolution to the House for final approval.The tax-and-spending blueprint released Wednesday will send a dozen House committees instructions on how to draft their pieces of the package, while 10 Senate committees will write bills.Typically, the committee instructions, which just include a budget target, are similar, if not identical, for the House and Senate. But differences of opinion between Republican leaders about how much to cut federal spending, as well as other disagreements, led to differing instructions.The House has a significantly higher threshold for cutting government spending than the Senate.The Agriculture Committee needs to slice at least $230 billion; Education and Workforce must reduce spending by a minimum of $330 billion; Energy and Commerce needs to cut no less than $880 billion; Financial Services must find at least $1 billion in savings; Natural Resources has a minimum of $1 billion; Oversight and Government Reform has a floor of $50 billion; and the Transportation Committee needs to reduce deficits by $10 billion or more.House committees that can increase the federal deficit include the Armed Services Committee with a cap of $100 billion in new spending, Homeland Security with a $90 billion ceiling for new funding for programs it oversees, Judiciary with a maximum of $110 billion and Ways and Means, which can increase deficits up to $4.5 trillion for tax cuts.Spending cuts in SenateSenators set a much lower bar for themselves in terms of spending cuts, though the way the reconciliation instructions are written, as a floor and not a ceiling, will give leeway for those committees to cut much more.Four Senate committees — Agriculture, Nutrition, and Forestry; Banking, Housing and Urban Affairs; Energy and Natural Resources; and Health, Education, Labor and Pensions, or HELP — must each find at least $1 billion in spending cuts over the 10-year budget window.Senate committees also got instructions for increasing the deficit, which will allow them to spend up to the dollar amount outlined in the budget resolution. Those committees include Armed Services at $150 billion; Commerce, Science and Transportation with $20 billion; Environment and Public Works at $1 billion; Finance with $1.5 trillion in new deficits, likely for tax cuts; Homeland Security at $175 billion and Judiciary with $175 billion.Once the House and Senate both vote to adopt the same budget resolution, the committees can formally begin drafting and marking up their bills.Those bills, according to the instructions, must be sent to the Budget committees before May 9. That panel will then bundle all of the various pieces together into one reconciliation package and send it to the floor.The House and Senate must vote to approve the same reconciliation package before it can go to President Donald Trump for his signature and become law.Republicans have a paper-thin majority in the House and will need to ensure that lawmakers from across the party support all of the elements going into the reconciliation package. Even a few defectors in that chamber could block the bill from moving forward.Senate GOP leaders have a bit more wiggle room, but cannot lose more than three of their members and pass a reconciliation bill.",,,,2025-04-02 19:04:19.080598

Gov. Larry Rhoden signed Senate Bill 54 into law on Friday. It reduces the amount of yearly tobacco tax revenue used to help people [&#8230;],"Tom Hedrick calibrates a mosquito fogger for the city of Groton. (Paul Kosel/Groton Independent) A move to put more tobacco tax money toward South Dakota’s day-to-day government expenses might mean more mosquito bites — and a greater risk of West Nile virus — after July.
Gov. Larry Rhoden signed Senate Bill 54 into law on Friday. It reduces the amount of yearly tobacco tax revenue used to help people quit and avoid smoking from $5 million to $2 million. The rest of the money raised annually by the tax — more than $40 million, typically — goes to the state’s general fund.
Backers of the bill said smoking rates have dropped, the need for prevention is lower, and the state needs the money to pay for its expanded Medicaid program. Opponents called the move foolish, citing spikes in the use of nicotine vape products as a blind spot in tobacco prevention that could cause public health trouble down the road.
Budget committee approves $3 million cut to SD’s tobacco-use prevention fund

One piece of the tobacco tax change didn’t get much attention, though. 
For the past 10 years, South Dakota has funneled a half-million dollars of the sin tax bounty it collects annually from tobacco users into mosquito control grants for cities and counties.
Those grants, cities and counties learned last week, won’t be available for the next fiscal year, which starts July 1.
The goal of the grant program was to reduce the risk of West Nile virus, the most severe version of which can be deadly. Fifty-four South Dakotans have died from West Nile since 1999.
The loss of the grant money could impact smaller communities more than larger ones. Joe Kippley, public health director for the city of Sioux Falls, said his department anticipated the loss and has budgeted to continue mosquito spraying. 
In smaller towns, the loss of grant funding could be a little harder to replace.
After this summer, “we’re not sure what will happen,” Viborg Finance Officer Brandy Skonhovd said.
Moving mosquito money around
The story of how cigarette dollars turned into insecticide grants begins in 2006. 
That’s the year voters passed Initiated Measure 2, which slapped an additional $1-per-pack tax on cigarettes and an extra 25% tax on other forms of tobacco on top of the state’s existing tobacco taxes.
The first $30 million of tax revenue generated as a result went to the state’s general fund, the measure specified, after which $5 million would be put in the Tobacco Prevention and Reduction Trust Fund and used for anti-smoking programming.

Tax collections beyond $35 million would split between the Property Tax Reduction Fund, the Education Enhancement Tobacco Trust Fund and the Health Care Tobacco Trust Fund. 
That setup had shifted by 2014. 
That’s the year Doneen Hollingsworth, who was the secretary of the Department of Health, asked lawmakers to sign off on using a half-million dollars from the $5 million anti-smoking fund for mosquito control grants. 
The recession of 2007 through 2009 tightened budgets, she said. The state had already begun to dip into that fund to pay for things like childhood immunizations, she told them, and there was a new problem to address in 2014.
The federal money for West Nile monitoring and mosquito control made available to states when the virus first emerged had dried up. Then-Gov. Dennis Daugaard proposed using tobacco tax money that year, Hollingsworth said, “to address this urgent public health issue” by keeping the grant money flowing to local governments.
That wouldn’t break the law, Hollingsworth assured the Legislature’s Joint Appropriations Committee. 
The state, in 2014 and today, gets about a million anti-smoking dollars a year from the federal government. As long as that money is available, she said, the state could skim up to a million prevention trust fund dollars off the top and still meet voters’ expectations.
“We’ve always spent at least $5 million on tobacco prevention and control,” she said.
Another tobacco tax shift
Since then, the state has spent about $5 million from the fund to control mosquitoes. Grant awards, used for chemicals or the equipment needed to spray it, are tied to the prevalence and risk of West Nile in local communities. 
During debate on this year’s legislative Senate Bill 54, Bureau of Finance and Management Commissioner Jim Terwilliger told lawmakers it never made much sense to tie the grants to tobacco funding. 
“That’s an example of the different things that I think can go away, and we could be smarter with these funds,” the commissioner told the Senate Appropriations Committee in February, during his pitch for reducing the amount of tobacco tax money the state spends on anti-smoking programs. 
Terwilliger rattled off statistics on lower smoking rates among teens and adults in the years since voters passed the tobacco tax, too, and said South Dakota spends more on anti-tobacco programming than other states.
Prevention groups fear consequences from Noem’s proposal to reduce funding for anti-tobacco efforts

Jennifer Stalley, Midwest policy director for the American Cancer Society Cancer Action Network, was on hand to refute Terwilliger point-by-point in her opposition testimony. 
But she and Terwilliger saw eye to eye on one thing. 
“I would tell you that I don’t think that fits within the letter of the law,” Stalley said of the use of tobacco money for mosquito control.
Lawmakers’ passage of SB 54 put an end to the $500,000 carve-out for West Nile, and appropriators didn’t supplement the state budget with any replacement funds to keep the grants going.
Tia Kafka, spokeswoman for the state Department of Health, said the state will continue parts of its West Nile virus programming. That includes federally funded risk prediction modeling and a federally funded epidemiologist to serve as the program’s overseer. 
Also continued will be the state’s West Nile Virus dashboard, which shows modeled risk and the mapped results of the mosquito collection efforts that attempt to catalog the prevalence of the mosquito species that spread the virus.
“However, very limited mosquito testing will occur in 2025, and the program’s sustainability beyond that year is uncertain,” Kafka said.
Virus modeling predicted 60 cases for 2024; the dashboard lists 21 total West Nile cases and one death from the disease. The Health Department’s website does not show a prediction for 2025.
Cities plan for uncertain future
It costs Viborg around $2,500 to buy the insecticide used to reduce West Nile risk, according to Skonhovd, the city finance officer. The city got $8,000 last year, though, to pay for new equipment.
The spraying in and around the southeast South Dakota town of 834 starts in May and continues into the fall. 
“When we have football games, we try to keep the mosquito population down for those,” Skonhovd said.
Paul Kosel runs the mosquito control program for Groton, population 1,355. Kosel is also the newspaper publisher and information technology supervisor for the community, bordered by wetlands on the eastern side of Brown County. That county has long been the state’s most reliably risky for West Nile in the two-plus decades the disease has been endemic in South Dakota.
“Trying to do mosquito control in Groton is a living nightmare because we’re surrounded by water,” Kosel said.

Kosel and Skonhovd both say they feel confident they’ll be able to pay for this year’s work with the money that’s available until July 1, when the tobacco-funded grant spigot turns off with the end of the state’s fiscal year. 
After that, they both hope the state finds a way to keep things going. Insecticide and equipment can be a strain on a small-town budget.
“It’s not cheap, that’s for sure,” Kosel said.
Larger cities could have an easier time. Joe Kippley, public health director for the city of Sioux Falls, set aside $750,000 for mosquito control this summer. Last year, the city received $20,000 from the state for spraying, but Kippley said the city knew the money would go away this year, and that it had previously set its budget up to withstand the expense of spraying with or without state help.
“We do not budget for these grant dollars annually because they are distributed through an application process and are therefore not guaranteed each year,” Kippley said in an emailed statement. “The discontinuation of this funding will not impact the city’s mosquito control program and services.”

More than 125,000 Minnesota households get help with their winter heating bills through the federal  Low-Income Home Energy Assistance Program, but that’s at risk now because the entire staff that run the program has been fired. 
As part of massive cuts to the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, every staffer was laid off from the Division of Energy Assistance, NPR reported this week.

The nonprofit energy consumer advocate Citizens Utility Board of Minnesota, known as CUB, released a statement Wednesday decrying the cuts. 


“Energy Assistance is a vital and extremely popular program,” said Annie Levenson-Falk, CUB’s executive director. “Even a delay in funding will mean that eligible Minnesotans risk utility shutoffs or being unable to refill empty propane or fuel oil tanks.” 


CUB says Minnesota is currently awaiting the final 10% of federal funding for the current program year, which was approved by Congress. If the funding is delayed, support to Minnesota households will be paused. .

(Photo courtesy Western New Mexico University)Western New Mexico University’s new board of regents will meet for the first time next week, taking the first steps in getting the university “back on track” following claims of misuse of funds and violation of fiduciary responsibilities.
The state Senate confirmed four regents for the Silver City university during the recent 60-day session, including former state Sen. Steven Neville, attorney John Wertheim, WNMU alumnus J. Dean Reed and student regent Keana Huerta.
The fifth regent seat remains empty. A spokesperson for Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham told Source NM that they did not have any updates about when the governor might announce a fifth regent nomination.
The terms of two members of the previous board of regents expired at the end of December and the other three regents submitted their resignations in January, about a year after the New Mexico Office of the State Auditor reported finding university leadership had misused hundreds of thousands of public funds on lavish trips and other spending. 
The board voted in December to terminate former university President Joseph Shepard’s contract and then authorized a $1.9 million severance package. Attorney General Raúl Torrez filed a civil suit against Shepard and the board in January, alleging they had violated fiduciary duties, New Mexico’s anti-donation clause, the Open Meetings Act and laws pertaining to unjust enrichment, not fulfilling contractual obligations and acting on an unenforceable contract.
Shepard filed a motion in March to dismiss the case against him, which Torrez opposes. A hearing on the motion is scheduled for June 16, according to court records.
Huerta told Source NM in a statement that the new board intends to keep the university’s students at the forefront of “our discussions and work diligently to ensure that any issues are addressed appropriately.”

“We as the board are committed to doing the right thing in this situation,” Huerta told Source in a written statement. “Ensuring transparency and accountability while upholding the integrity of the institution are our priorities.”
Huerta is originally from the Silver City area and a third-year student at WNMU, which she said makes her uniquely qualified to “understand the needs and challenges of our local students, faculty, and staff,” she said.
Neville, a former state senator who represented Senate District 2 in San Juan County, told Source he does not want to make a judgement on the ongoing investigation and litigation until he has more facts and that he will leave the legal action to the attorney general and the state auditor.

“My job is to try to get us a new president, try to get things back on track, make sure that the books are balanced and go from there,” he said, noting that ensuring students’ experiences remain positive and quality education is provided are a priority. “Western’s a very good university so we want to make sure that that focus continues.”
Neville added that he has spoken to his fellow regents and said they are all working on gaining more knowledge of the university’s situation and are thinking along similar lines in regard to their next steps.
Legislators introduced four pieces of legislation addressing the role of university regents and how they are chosen during the recent 60-day session, but only one bill passed and awaits the governor’s signature. Senate Bill 19 would require new regents to complete 10 hours of training within six months of being appointed. 
House Joint Resolution 12, supported by the attorney general, died in a Senate committee, and proposed asking voters to approve a constitutional amendment codifying regents’ fiduciary duties, moving proceedings to remove regents from the state Supreme Court to district courts and allow the attorney general or majority of the board to initiate removal of a regent.
Senate Joint Resolution 7 also died in a Senate committee. The resolution proposed an amendment to the state Constitution requiring the governor to select regents from a vetted list provided by a nominating committee. 
Senate Bill 266 would have required regents to submit certain employment contracts to the State Board of Finance for approval, adding a level of oversight to boards of regents.

Rep. Mike Brandenburg, R-Edgeley, one of five House members who was absent Tuesday, requested another vote Wednesday. The resolution passed 53-39.
House members Wednesday rehashed many of the same points of debate on the resolution, which seeks to alter some changes to the state constitution approved in a 2022 statewide vote. 
Term limits resolution narrowly fails in North Dakota House; reconsideration vote possible Wednesday

North Dakotans in 2022 passed a measure that put term limits for state legislators into the  constitution. Lawmakers are now limited to serving up to eight years in the House and up to eight years in the Senate.
The resolution creates a ballot measure that, if approved by voters in 2026, would allow lawmakers to serve four complete terms, a total of 16 years, in either chamber of the Legislature. It also clarifies a partial term of a lawmaker would not count against the term limit.
The resolution, sponsored by Sen. Michael Dwyer, R-Bismarck, passed the Senate in March on a 24-23 vote.
Before Wednesday’s vote, Rep. Steve Vetter, R-Grand Forks, warned that the proposal doesn’t make a significant enough change for lawmakers who think more experience is beneficial in the Legislature. 
Rep. Christina Wolff, R-Minot, said there is still a question of whether the resolution is even constitutional, given a provision included in the 2022 measure that says only a citizen-initiated measure could undo the term limits. 
Wolff, who is in her first term, also questioned the value of legislative experience.  
“I realize that there’s a lot of really good information that people like me, new people here, could use, but that institutional knowledge has also tripled the budget in the last 10 years,” she said.

The Oklahoma Appleseed Center for Law and Justice filed a lawsuit on Tuesday against Walters, his administration and the state Board of Education in Oklahoma County District Court. 
The lawsuit accuses the Oklahoma State Department of Education of violating open meetings laws and of improperly withholding records detailing Walters’ Library Media Advisory Committee.
In an unrelated matter, Walters sued the Freedom From Religion Foundation on Monday in Muskogee federal court, complaining of the cease-and-desist letters the Wisconsin-based organization has sent to Oklahoma schools over alleged violations of church-state separation.

“Oklahoma will never be bullied by radical, out-of-state atheists who use intimidation and harassment against kids,” Walters said in a statement.
The two organizations have been involved in a court battle against Walters before. Both supplied attorneys to a pending lawsuit challenging Walters’ purchase of Bibles with state funds and his mandate that schools teach from the Christian text. 
Walters’ lawsuit accused the Freedom from Religion Foundation of inhibiting religious freedom in Achille Public Schools when it discouraged the southeast Oklahoma district from having student-led prayer during morning announcements.
The foundation called the lawsuit frivolous and said it won’t back down. 
The civil suit filed against Walters on Tuesday was “nothing more than a politically motivated attack,” Walters said in a statement through a spokesperson.
“These extremists are using the legal system to harass and obstruct progress in an effort to push their radical agenda,” Walters said.
Oklahoma Appleseed filed its case after the state agency failed to provide details of the formation, membership selection and activities of the Library Media Advisory Committee despite repeated requests, according to the lawsuit.
The Tulsa-based nonprofit requested that a judge order the Education Department to release the records and pay for the group’s attorney fees. 
The lawsuit also asked a judge to declare that the agency violated the Oklahoma Open Records Act and that the advisory committee broke the state’s Open Meeting Act, which requires government boards to conduct their business in public view.
“This lawsuit is about government transparency and accountability,” Oklahoma Appleseed legal director Brent Rowland said in a statement. “The public has a right to know who is making decisions affecting its public schools. Oklahomans have a right to expect that their government will follow the law regarding open records and open meetings.”
The Education Department has said it doesn’t view the advisory committee as a “public body” subject to open meeting laws.
“The Library Media Advisory Committee is a volunteer-based group responsible for reviewing books for suitability to minor students based on content,” the agency’s open records office wrote to Oklahoma Voice on Dec. 17 in response to a request for documents. “Please note that this committee is exempt from the Open Meetings Act, as it does not have decision-making authority or engage in formal deliberations. It does not meet the legal definition of a ‘public body,’ as it does not conduct meetings or engage in decision-making activities. Its role is solely advisory, and it is not supported by, nor entrusted with the management of, public funds or property.”

Walters formed the advisory committee in 2023 to review whether certain books are age-appropriate for schools or whether they violate state rules against sexual content. 
Following the committee’s recommendation, the Education Department ordered Edmond Public Schools to remove the best-selling novels “The Kite Runner” and “The Glass Castle” from its high school libraries. Edmond appealed to the Oklahoma Supreme Court, who decided that local schools, not the state Education Department, have control over what books to keep on their library shelves.
Walters and his administration have refused to disclose the names of the advisory committee members but one — out-of-state social media personality Chaya Raichik, who runs an account known as Libs of TikTok. 
Raichik and the Library Media Advisory Committee also are named as defendants in the Oklahoma Appleseed lawsuit.
“(The state Education Department) will not be bullied by extremist organizations trying to weaponize the courts and remains committed to transparency and compliance with all legal requirements,” Walters said.
The state agency has denied multiple requests from news media, including Oklahoma Voice, to identify the rest of the committee’s members. 
Email records the agency provided to Oklahoma Voice were heavily redacted to cover up individuals’ names. The Education Department’s open records office has so far refused to cite a state law requiring that these names be kept confidential.
Oklahoma Appleseed contended these records should be available to the public with “narrowly tailored and legally justified redactions.”
“In this instance, the state Department of Education has formed a Library Media Advisory Committee to make decisions about students’ access to books when our state Supreme Court has determined those decisions should be made by local school boards,” Rowland said. “State officials cannot hide behind closed doors and avoid public accountability, and why would they want to?”

,DC,2025-04-02 21:46:14+00:00,News From The States - Fair. Fearless. Free.,"Vexed by judicial restraints on Trump, U.S. Senate GOP floats bill to undercut courts",Ariana Figueroa,,,,,https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/vexed-judicial-restraints-trump-us-senate-gop-floats-bill-undercut-courts,,"WASHINGTON — Amid dozens of injunctions placed against the Trump administration, Republicans on the U.S. Senate Committee on the Judiciary discussed a bill Wednesday to curb the nationwide effects of those orders from federal judges.The bill, sponsored by GOP Iowa Sen. Chuck Grassley, who leads the committee, would prohibit district court judges from issuing injunctions that have nationwide effects.“We all have to agree to give up the universal injunction as a weapon against policies we disagree with,” Grassley said. “The damage it causes to the judicial system and to our democracy is too great.”As of Friday, 39 judges who were appointed across “five different presidents and sitting in 11 different district courts across seven circuits” have ruled against the Trump administration, said one of the witnesses, Stephen Vladeck of Georgetown University Law Center.President Donald Trump and Republican allies in Congress have complained that such injunctions give judges in single districts too much power to stymie the administration’s agenda.Trump has also taken to social media to attack the judges, especially one who temporarily barred use of the Alien Enemies Act of 1798 to quickly deport Venezuelan nationals.Senate Majority Leader John Thune of South Dakota said Tuesday that Republicans are considering Grassley’s bill, but did not commit to bringing it to the floor for a vote.House Republicans have introduced a similar bill.Senate Democrats criticized the hearing and argued that the reason there are so many injunctions against the president’s executive orders is because they are unconstitutional.The top Democrat on the committee, Sen. Dick Durbin of Illinois, pointed to the several nationwide injunctions against Trump’s executive order to end the constitutional right to birthright citizenship, which the administration has asked the U.S. Supreme Court in an emergency request to reverse.Republicans see abuseRepublicans characterized the flurry of injunctions against administration actions as judicial activism.Republican Sen. Josh Hawley of Missouri said the injunctions were unprecedented.Hawley called the rulings from district courts a “pattern of abuse.” He added that it’s not only being done with nationwide injunctions, but with temporary restraining orders.Florida Sen. Ashley Moody also took issue with temporary restraining orders, which generally are not appealable.“There is keen interest in making sure our judiciary system remains impartial and that it is making rulings only in terms of relief to the parties before it and that we are encouraging expeditious resolution of these extraordinary important matters,” Moody said.Criticism sparks threats, Dems saySens. Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota and Sheldon Whitehouse of Rhode Island raised concerns about the increased threats of violence aimed at judges.Whitehouse said the reaction from Republicans about preliminary injunctions against the Trump administration puts those judges and their families at risk.“The discomfort to fury…about decisions against the Trump administration may actually have a lot to do with the unprecedented lawlessness and lawbreaking of the Trump administration rather than a weird cabal of judges trying to intrude,” Whitehouse said.Klobuchar said that Trump has attacked judges on social media and has posted images of himself wearing a crown.“We do not live in a kingdom,” she said. “It is important that we not lose sight of the underlying cause of these injunctions. It is not that these judges are ‘crooked’ or ‘lunatics’ or ‘evil.’ Those are words used by the president, it is because the administration is violating the constitution.   Supreme Court Chief Justice John Roberts on March 18 issued a rare statement, pushing back against Trump’s suggestion that a judge who issued an injunction against an administration order face impeachment.“For more than two centuries, it has been established that impeachment is not an appropriate response to disagreement concerning a judicial decision,” Roberts said. “The normal appellate review process exists for that purpose.”Jennifer Shutt contributed to this story.",,,,2025-04-02 18:05:13.626032

(Courtesy of Mandy Roman with Project Weber/RENEW)Rep. Jay Edwards expected opposition when he first pitched the idea of setting up medically supervised sites in Rhode Island where people could safely use illegal drugs. 
But in the four years since Edwards’ bill was signed into law, making Rhode Island the first state in the nation to authorize “harm reduction centers,” concern and misunderstanding has dissipated over what researchers and health care providers agree may help mitigate drug overdoses and deaths. Since opening in mid-January, the state’s first and only harm reduction center has drawn more than 500 visitors and prevented 27 overdose deaths, according to information from Project Weber/RENEW, the nonprofit that operates the south Providence site.
Which is why Edwards was caught off guard by the lengthy and fiery debate among his House colleagues Tuesday over a proposed two-year extension to the existing program, to March 1, 2028. 
“It kind of surprised me,” Edwards, a Tiverton Democrat, said in an interview Wednesday. “This is a law that is already in place and we already have a site up and running. They’re not going to take it down this minute.”
First state-regulated overdose prevention center could open by summer in Providence

The House ultimately approved the extension legislation by a 52-17 vote, with six members absent, following a 90-minute floor debate. The passionate debate centered not on whether the existing pilot program should be extended, and more on the criminal and health implications of offering a place for people to use illegal drugs at all.
“They were just rehashing the same issue that we already decided,” Edwards said in an interview Wednesday. “There was nothing novel about the opposition.”
He went on to characterize opponents’ proclamations as “grandstanding” and “playing to the cameras.”
Phrases like “sanctioned opium dens” and “Band-Aid approach” were invoked by opposing lawmakers of both political parties, who alleged that giving people a place to safely use drugs would drive up violence and criminal activity in the surrounding neighborhood.
The city of Providence has not received any police, fire or emergency management calls to the address of Project Weber/RENEW’s center near Rhode Island Hospital since the safe injection site opened this year, Anthony Vega, a city spokesperson, said in an email Wednesday. Data on 911 calls and arrests to other addresses surrounding the center were not immediately available.
How the center impacts visitors and the community, including police activity, is being studied by Brown University researchers.
More time = more data
Amendments to Edwards’ extension bill bolster program reporting requirements to include the number of people connected to other specialists for addiction treatment, and total overdoses prevented. Existing law requires state-authorized harm reduction centers to provide other health-screening and disease prevention resources by medically trained professionals.
Project Weber/RENEW relocated its headquarters to the south Providence building that houses the safe injection site, providing space for administrative work and other community health and support services, Roman said.
House Minority Whip David Place, a Burrillville Republican, supported the extension of the pilot program as a way to gather more data on its effectiveness, even though he said he “adamantly opposed” the original bill.
“We made a decision however many years ago to put this policy into effect,” Place said during the floor debate. “We owe it to ourselves to check it out and see how it works.”










We made a decision however many years ago to put this policy into effect. We owe it to ourselves to check it out and see how it works. 


– House Minority Whip David Place, a Burrillville Republican 


Mandy Roman, a spokesperson for Project Weber/RENEW, also stressed the importance of a longer operational period in an email Wednesday.
“We know firsthand that building trust, gathering meaningful data, and demonstrating impact takes time,” Roman said. “A longer pilot period is essential to fully evaluate the program’s effectiveness in saving lives and connecting people to care.”
Gov. Dan McKee, Providence Mayor Brett Smiley and the Mental Health Association of Rhode Island also wrote to lawmakers to back the extension bill.

Critics reemerge 
Rep. Pat Serpa, a West Warwick Democrat, pointed to the lack of buy-in from cities and towns except for Providence — the law requires city or town councils to formally vote to agree to host a harm reduction center — as evidence of the public opposition.
“If this is so virtuous, if this such a great idea, why don’t you propose this in your district,” said Rep. Jon Brien, a Woonsocket independent. “My suspicion is there will be somebody sitting in your seat after the next election?”
Yet Rep. José Batista, a Providence Democrat whose district includes the center operated by Project Weber/RENEW, supported the program, and the two-year extension. He acknowledged he was initially concerned.
“The shortest point that helped convince me was, if you don’t like safe locations, what about all the unsafe locations that exist right now: under bridges, in the dark,” Batista said.
Batista also argued that punitive measures to sanction illegal drug activity have historically failed. 
“Perhaps we should try something different, something backed by science and research and data,” he said. 










I am totally against drugs, but guess what, if these harm reduction centers save one person, what’s the value of that life? I’d give everything I have, everything I own to see my brother again. 


– Rep. Gregory Costantino, a Lincoln Democrat whose brother died due to substance abuse 


Drug-related overdoses in Rhode Island fell by 21% from 2023 to 2024, to 320 deaths, according to state health data. Illegal drugs, used alone or in combination with authorized prescription medications, continue to dominate, responsible for nearly 84% of drug-related overdose deaths in 2024. 
“We have to stop thinking people who use drugs are bad people and we have to stop shaming them,” said Karen Alzate, a Pawtucket Democrat. “We are not here as a legislative body to continue to shame people who go into these centers.”
State law specifies that harm reduction centers be funded by revenue from opioid settlement lawsuits. But several opposing lawmakers decried other costs associated with centers. Project Weber/RENEW, as a nonprofit, doesn’t pay property taxes, for example.
Rep. Charlene Lima, a Cranston Democrat, also questioned the burden on first responders, assuming that police and ambulance visits to the south Providence neighborhood had increased since Project Weber/RENEW opened its doors.
“Don’t tell me you think this is free and it’s just falling out of the sky,” Lima said. “That’s a load of baloney.”

When politics is personal 
Amid the rising tones and tensions, Rep. Gregory Costantino, a Lincoln Democrat, struck a noticeably subdued tenor as he shared a story about an unnamed pair of teenage brothers, the older of whom struggled with addiction to various drugs. 
“At 27 years old, I had to bury my brother,” Costantino said. “It devastated, devastated our family.”
The whispers in the chamber quieted as Costantino continued.
“I am totally against drugs, but guess what, if these harm reduction centers save one person, what’s the value of that life? I’d give everything I have, everything I own to see my brother again.”
Similar though not identical legislation in the Rhode Island Senate sponsored by Melissa Murray, a Woonsocket Democrat, would make the pilot program permanent. Murray’s bill remains under review by the Senate Committee on Health and Human Services following an initial hearing on March 4. A committee vote has not been scheduled, and potential amendments to Murray’s bill are still being reviewed, Greg Paré, a Senate spokesperson, said in a text message Wednesday.

(Photo by Andrew Harnik/Getty Images)Since President Donald Trump threatened to withhold federal funding unless Maine complies with his executive order banning transgender girls from playing girls’ sports, the state has been the subject of several probes and funding cuts that have been widely interpreted as retaliatory.
“We’re going to follow the law sir. We’ll see you in court,” Gov. Janet Mills told the president in a heated exchange while attending a White House event as part of the National Governors Association winter summit on Feb. 21. 
The Democrat was referring to the Maine Human Rights Act, which was amended in 2021 to include gender identity as a protected class against discrimination. Mills and Maine Attorney General Aaron Frey maintain that law supersedes the president’s edict. 
Mills warned in a statement later that day that the “rule of law in our country” is at stake and that the president will likely continue to target those who speak out against his wishes.
“Maine may be one of the first states to undergo an investigation by his administration, but we won’t be the last,” Mills said.
In the hours and weeks that followed, the federal government launched a series of investigations into Maine institutions. Below is a running list of the federal government’s actions against the state:

USDA pausing funding to Maine school programs over alleged Title IX violations


By: Eesha Pendharkar - Wednesday April 2, 2025 5:35 pm












The U.S. Department of Agriculture is pausing federal funding for some school programs in response to Maine’s alleged violations of Title IX, though the agency has not conducted a formal investigation.
“You cannot openly violate federal law against discrimination in education and expect federal funding to continue unabated,” USDA Secretary Brooke Rollins wrote in a letter to Gov. Janet Mills on Wednesday. “Today, I am freezing Maine’s federal funds for certain administrative and technological functions in schools.
“This is only the beginning,” the letter warned.
School lunch programs, which are funded by the USDA, will not be impacted by the freeze, Rollins said. However, the agency is “reviewing all research and education-related funding in Maine” for compliance with federal anti-discrimination laws “and the priorities of the Trump administration.”
For Maine to continue receiving funding, the state will have to “demonstrate compliance with Title IX’s protection of female student athletes from having to compete with or against or having to appear unclothed before males,” Rollins’ letter said.

The U.S. Department of Education’s Office for Civil Rights issued a final warning Monday to the Maine Department of Education regarding its noncompliance with a federal directive for allowing trans girls to participate in girls’ sports.
If the state does not propose an agreement that’s acceptable to the office by April 11, the case will be referred to the Department of Justice, the letter said.
Meanwhile, a separate investigation by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services’ civil rights office that found Maine in violation of Title IX for “continuing to unlawfully allow” trans girls to compete in girl’s sports has been referred to the U.S. Department of Justice, according to a Monday social media post from the agency.

Federal probe targets Maine school gender policies, citing parental rights


By: Eesha Pendharkar - Friday March 28, 2025 5:12 pm












District policies that protect students’ privacy when it comes to gender identity might be violating federal law by depriving parents of information, according to the U.S. Department of Education.
In another directed investigation launched by the department based on reports from right-wing media about Maine districts complying with the Maine Human Rights Act, the department alleged that by developing plans to affirm students’ gender, districts may be in violation of the Family Educational Rights Privacy Act (FERPA).
In a letter dated March 28 to the Maine Department of Education, Frank Miller, acting director for the Student Privacy Policy Office, highlighted a 2016 memo by the Maine Human Rights Commission that explains the interpretation of the Act: “In the event that the student and their parent/legal guardian do not agree with regard to the student’s sexual orientation, gender identity, or gender expression, the educational institution should, whenever possible, abide by the wishes of the student with regard to their gender identity and expression while at school,” the memo states.
“The overall memorandum on its face appears to give school officials discretion that would infringe on the rights of a parent under FERPA,” Miller said in his letter.
He also alleged that “this same rhetoric may lead to Title IX violations if applied in a school environment,” which may warrant the investigation to be referred to the OCR.

Gov. Mills responds to Trump’s demand for apology


By: Lauren McCauley - Monday March 24, 2025 12:49 pm












Gov. Janet Mills responded to President Donald Trump’s demand that she apologize after the Democrat refused to capitulate to an executive order banning transgender girls from student athletics.
“I don’t communicate with public officials by tweet or Instagram or social media,” Mills told reporters, referring to Trump’s weekend post on Truth Social, at a Monday event celebrating the purchase of Bangor mobile home park by its residents.
“Second, all of my issues are about the rule of law pure and simple,” she continued. “It’s not about transgender sports, it is about who makes the laws and who enforces the laws. I read the constitution. Constitution says the president, the chief executive, shall take care that the law be faithfully executed. It doesn’t allow him to make laws out of whole cloth by tweet or Instagram post or press release or executive order that is fundamental law, and I stand for the rule of law and the separation of powers.”
Without naming Trump, Mills went on to say that “if the current occupant of the White House wants to protect women and girls, he should start by protecting the women and teenage girls who are suffering miscarriages and dying because they can’t get basic, life-saving health care in states across this country,” according to the Bangor Daily News.
She added that people in Maine are waiting for an economic plan. “We’ve seen tariffs and threat of tariffs that threaten our economy here in Maine and across the country.”
Last week, the U.S. Department of Education notified Maine that its Department of Education was found in violation of Title IX, a federal civil rights rule that bans sex-based discrimination in schools, giving the state 10 days to comply. Maine is expected to respond with legal action.

Trump demands Gov. Mills give ‘full-throated apology’


By: Lauren McCauley -  9:14 am












In a post to his Truth Social account early Saturday, President Donald Trump demanded a “full-throated apology” from Gov. Janet Mills, following her refusal to cave to his administration’s order to ban transgender girls from girls sports.
Maine public schools follow the Maine Human Rights Act, which was amended in 2021 to include gender identity as a protected class against discrimination.
The Republican president also incorrectly claimed that the state has issued an apology for its policy — something that was swiftly rebutted by Maine Secretary of State Shenna Bellows, who wrote that, as the “official keeper of all state records and guardian of the seal,” she “can confirm ‘State of Maine’ hasn’t apologized.”
Here’s Trump’s full post:
“While the State of Maine has apologized for their Governor’s strong, but totally incorrect, statement about men playing in women’s sports while at the White House Governor’s Conference, we have not heard from the Governor herself, and she is the one that matters in such cases. Therefore, we need a full-throated apology from the Governor herself, and a statement that she will never make such an unlawful challenge to the Federal Government again, before this case can be settled. I’m sure she will be able to do that quite easily. Thank you for your attention to this matter and, MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!!! DJT”

U.S. Department of Education determines Maine guilty of violating Title IX


By: Lauren McCauley - Thursday March 20, 2025 10:04 am












The U.S. Department of Education notified Maine late Wednesday that its Department of Education was found in violation of a federal civil rights rule that bans sex-based discrimination in schools.
The letter, addressed to Maine Education Commissioner Pender Makin from the U.S. DOE Office for Civil Rights, said the determination is based on state and district policies that permit transgender girls from participating in girls’ sports. It gives the state ten days to comply with President Donald Trump’s executive order banning transgender girls from playing girls’ sports.
Maine public schools follow the Maine Human Rights Act, which was amended in 2021 to include gender identity as a protected class against discrimination. Title IX, the federal law banning sex-based discrimination does not reference trans people directly, but the Trump administration is interpreting Maine’s policy as discrimination against cisgender girls.



This finding is the latest among several federal probes launched against the state following a clash between Gov. Janet Mills and Trump over trans inclusion in girls’ sports.

USDA deems University of Maine System to be in compliance with Title IX


By: Eesha Pendharkar - Wednesday March 19, 2025 5:32 pm












Though the University of Maine System was officially cleared by the U.S. Department of Agriculture of any violations of Title IX, Chancellor Dannel Malloy said the system had been in compliance the entire time, having previously called the probe “an unnecessary distraction.”
UMS follows National Collegiate Athletic Association rules, which were updated last month to ban trans women from women’s sports after President Donald Trump issued an executive order banning transgender girls from playing girls’ sport.
The USDA investigation was among several launched last month as part of federal scrutiny of Maine’s education policies, stemming from a clash between Gov. Janet Mills and Trump over trans inclusion in girls’ sports. USDA froze funds to the university system last week for potential Title IX and Title IV violations, which ban sex and race-based discrimination respectively. After Sen. Susan Collins reportedly intervened with the Trump administration, funding to UMS was restored.
On Wednesday, USDA concluded its compliance review in a news release saying that the university system was in compliance but also warning the rest of the state to follow suit or risk losing funding.
“UMaine’s decision to side with sanity is a win for women and girls in Maine,” the release said. “The choice for the rest of Maine is simple: protect equal opportunities for women, as required by law, or lose funding.”

Trump administration says Maine Principals’ Association, high school violating Title IX


By: Emma Davis - Monday March 17, 2025 7:46 pm












The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services Office for Civil Rights announced on Monday that it determined the Maine Principals’ Association and Greely High School in Cumberland are each in violation of Title IX for allowing transgender girls to compete in girls’ sports.
On Feb. 21, DHHS issued a notice of violation against the Maine Department of Education for violating that same federal civil rights law, which bans sex-based discrimination in schools and colleges, and on March 5 expanded the compliance review to MPA, which governs sports in Maine, and Greely High School.
According to DHHS, the entities can “voluntarily commit within 10 days to resolve the matter through a signed agreement or risk referral to the U.S. Department of Justice for appropriate action.”   The full agreement, obtained by the Bangor Daily News, can be read here.

USDA backtracks on university funding halt


By: Lauren McCauley - Thursday March 13, 2025 12:30 pm












Two days after the U.S. Department of Agriculture announced it would be halting funds to the University of Maine System while it continues its Title IX compliance review, the agency backtracked.
In a statement, Sen. Susan Collins said after consulting with the Trump administration she was alerted that the funding had been restored.
“This USDA funding is critically important not only to the University of Maine, but to our farmers and loggers, as well as to the many people who work in Maine’s agriculture, aquaculture, and forestry industries,” Collins said. “Now that funding has been restored, the work that the University does in partnership with the many people and communities who depend on these programs can continue.”

Amid probe, U.S. Department of Agriculture halts funding to Maine university system


By: Eesha Pendharkar -  12:30 pm












On March 10, just over two weeks after the U.S. Department of Agriculture announced an investigation into the University of Maine System, school leaders received a forwarded email from USDA’s Office of the Chief Financial Officer apparently ordering a temporary pause in funding for the system while the agency evaluates whether it should take any follow-up actions to “prospective Title VI or Title IX violations,” according to a news release from the university system.
“Please take any necessary actions to effectuate this direction from leadership. This pause will remain in effect until further notice,” the USDA email said.
Last fiscal year, USDA awarded $29.78 million to UMaine for research on a wide variety of agriculture innovations and environmental issues, including PFAS contamination on Maine farms, sustainable packaging materials derived from Maine forest-based materials, potato breeding and varietal development, sustainable lobster fishing and support for 4-H youth leadership and STEM skill development programs, which serve tens of thousands of Maine youth every year. 
The University of Southern Maine also has several active USDA awards. 
The state’s public universities are members of the National Collegiate Athletic Association, which banned trans women from women’s sports following Trump’s executive order, and are “operating in a manner entirely consistent with that association’s recently updated policies,” university spokesperson Samantha Warren said.
That means that the funding was halted despite the fact that the system can’t allow trans women to compete on women’s teams.

Social Security snafu puts state on edge


By: Lauren McCauley -  12:29 pm












Another incident that was initially thought to be retaliatory but later deemed an “error” had state officials on edge. 
On March 6, the Portland Press Herald reported that Maine Department of Health and Human Services had been notified by the Social Security Administration that it would be ending the “Enumeration at Birth” process, which allows parents to check a box on a form shortly after a child’s birth in order to receive a mailed Social Security card.
The state agency sent an email to birth certifiers on March 5 alerting them of the change, “effective immediately.”
By March 7, the agency had reversed course while Sens. Angus King and Susan Collins asked for a briefing “to explain why this decision was made at the start.”
A spokesperson for Collins told Maine Morning Star that the Republican did receive a call from Social Security Acting Commissioner Leland Dudek during which he explained it was done in error and let her know it was fully reversed.

Maine Sea Grant to be renegotiated


By: AnnMarie Hilton -  12:28 pm












Less than one week after the University of Maine System was notified that funding for the Maine Sea Grant program had been cut, the U.S. Department of Commerce said on March 5 it would “reopen bilateral negotiations” after appeals from members of Maine’s congressional delegation.
Vice Admiral Nancy Hann credited Republican Sen. Susan Collins’ outreach to Secretary of Commerce Howard Lutnick. Independent Sen. Angus King and Rep. Chellie Pingree also sent a letter to Lutnick demanding he immediately reverse the “reckless decision” to terminate the federal grant.

Maine Sea Grant funding cut


By: AnnMarie Hilton -  12:28 pm












The University of Maine said it was notified late Feb. 28 that the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration was immediately discontinuing funding for the $4.5 million Maine Sea Grant, according to university spokesperson Samantha Warren. 
The grant has helped finance statewide research, strengthened coastal communities and supported thousands of jobs over more than five decades. 
The Maine Sea Grant fosters coastal workforce development, hands-on marine science education for students of all grade levels, research to inform lobster and other fisheries management, as well as storm preparedness for working waterfronts. 
It has supported thousands of jobs over more than five decades, including 20 current university employees, according to Warren, who said that every federal dollar spent on the program results in $15 of economic activity in the state, amounting to a total annual impact of $23.5 million.
However, the letter from NOAA said the grant’s work is “no longer relevant to the focus of the Administration’s priorities and program objectives.”
Maine’s Sea Grant program is one of 34 across coastal and Great Lakes states throughout the country. However, it appears to have been the only one cut.

U.S. Department of Justice threatens to sue Maine


By: Maine Morning Star -  12:27 pm












In a letter to Mills dated Feb. 25, U.S. Attorney General Pam Bondi threatened to sue the state if federal investigations show that “relevant Maine entities are indeed denying girls an equal opportunity to participate in sports and athletic events by requiring them to compete against” trans girls. 
“Maine should be on notice,” Bondi warned, adding that “the Department of Justice stands ready to take all appropriate action to enforce federal law,” referring to the Trump administration’s interpretation of TItle IX.

U.S. Department of Health and Human Services determines Maine guilty of Title IX violation


By: Eesha Pendharkar -  12:26 pm












On Feb. 25, the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services issued a notice of violation against the Maine Department of Education for violating Title IX. 
Concluding just four days after it was launched, the investigation included no interviews, data requests or negotiations, according to the Maine Attorney General’s Office, which was notified by the agency via emailed letter that the state had violated Title IX, the federal law banning sex-based discrimination in schools and colleges. The letter also handed the case over to the U.S. Department of Justice —  a rare outcome for such a probe.
The lack of process followed by the agency’s Office for Civil Rights (OCR) defies decades of precedent, according to Jackie Wernz, a former OCR lawyer for the U.S. Department of Education who now represents schools nationwide in such cases. Within any federal agency, the OCR typically conducts lengthy investigations with fact-finding, interviews and legal analysis of how exactly the agency under investigation violated federal laws the office is tasked with upholding, including Title IX.
But in this case, OCR simply appears to be enforcing the Trump administration’s stance on trans athletes, according to Wernz. 
If Maine does not sue or comply, the department could withhold funds from the state as soon as 10 days after the notice, which was sent on Feb. 25. While the letter does not go into detail about the exact amount of funding that could be withheld, Maine received more than $700,000 from HHS in 2024.

U.S. Department of Agriculture Title IX review


By: Lauren McCauley -  12:26 pm












On Feb. 22, the U.S. Department of Agriculture notified Maine Gov. Janet Mills and University of Maine System Chancellor Dannel Malloy that it had also launched a Title IX review. 
As a land grant university, the University of Maine System receives funding from the agency’s Agricultural Research Service and National Institute of Food and Agriculture, which in recent years totaled over $100 million, according to USDA Acting General Counsel Ralph Linden. 
“Should the University of Maine or other entities receiving funds from USDA be found to be out of compliance, additional funding may be in jeopardy,” Linden wrote.

On Feb. 21, the same day that the U.S. Department of Education announced its investigation into Maine, the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services’ civil rights division quickly followed suit. 
The agency said it was initiating a compliance review of the Maine Department of Education, including the University of Maine System, “based on information that Maine intends to defy” the president’s executive order on transgender athletes.
“The investigation will examine whether the State of Maine engaged in discrimination on the basis of sex under Title IX of the Education Amendments of 1972, as amended, and its HHS implementing regulation,” the announcement read.

U.S. Department of Education Title IX review


By: Lauren McCauley -  12:24 pm












Hours after Mills and Trump traded barbs, the U.S. Department of Education’s Office for Civil Rights announced it was launching a Title IX investigation into the Maine Department of Education as well as Maine School Administrative District 51, which is based in Cumberland, in response to reports that Greely High School is “continuing to allow at least one male student to compete in girls’ categories.”
The agency is arguing that Maine schools’ adherence to the protections in the Maine Human Rights Act is in violation of Title IX, which prohibits sex-based discrimination in any school or any other education program that receives federal funding.
In response, Mills issued a statement saying the effort to “withhold federal funding authorized and appropriated by Congress and paid for by Maine taxpayers in an attempt to coerce someone into compliance with his will” is “a violation of our Constitution and of our laws, which I took an oath to uphold.”",https://mainemorningstar.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/donaldtrumpfeb112025_0-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-04-02 18:05:13.626032

Greenberg has led the North Dakota Department of Labor and Human Rights as interim commissioner since January.
A native of Winnipeg, Manitoba, Greenberg earned his bachelor’s degree from the University of Minnesota Crookston and his law degree from the University of North Dakota School of Law in Grand Forks. He worked as a law clerk at a private firm in 2022 and spent the next two years in the Governor’s Office serving as a legal and policy adviser.
“Zach has proven himself to be a capable leader these past few months, ensuring North Dakota’s labor and human rights laws are enforced in a fair and timely manner,” Armstrong said in a news release. 
The Department of Labor and Human Rights is responsible for enforcing North Dakota labor and human rights laws. The department licenses employment agencies in the state and can verify the status of independent contractor relationships.
Greenberg replaced Nathan Svihovec, who served under former Gov. Doug Burgum.
“Working together, we will continue to meet the needs of employees and employers, resolve disputes with neutrality and fairness, and treat all parties with empathy, patience, courtesy and respect,” Greenberg said in the release.

(Photo by Robin Opsahl/Iowa Capital Dispatch)The U.S. Department of Agriculture is pausing federal funding for some school programs in response to Maine’s alleged violations of Title IX, though the agency has not conducted a formal investigation. 
“You cannot openly violate federal law against discrimination in education and expect federal funding to continue unabated,” USDA Secretary Brooke Rollins wrote in a letter to Gov. Janet Mills on Wednesday. “Today, I am freezing Maine’s federal funds for certain administrative and technological functions in schools. 
“This is only the beginning,” the letter warned.
School lunch programs, which are funded by the USDA, will not be impacted by the freeze, Rollins said. However, the agency is “reviewing all research and education-related funding in Maine” for compliance with federal anti-discrimination laws “and the priorities of the Trump administration.”
For Maine to continue receiving funding, the state will have to “demonstrate compliance with Title IX’s protection of female student athletes from having to compete with or against or having to appear unclothed before males,” Rollins’ letter said. 
The funding freeze comes amid a barrage of actions targeting Maine following President Donald Trump and Mills’ heated exchange over the state’s protections for transgender student athletes.
Both the U.S. Departments of Education and Health and Human Services determined Maine’s polices allowing transgender girls to compete in girls’ sports, which is supported by the Maine Human Rights Act, violate federal protections against sex-based discrimination in schools. Title IX does not reference trans people directly, but the Trump administration has interpreted Maine’s policy as discrimination against cisgender girls. 
Maine has not responded to the investigations. 
Last month, USDA preemptively froze millions in grant and research funding for the state’s public universities as it reviewed whether they were in compliance with Title IX and Title IV, which bans race-based discrimination. The agency later determined the University of Maine System to be in compliance, and funding was restored. 
The university system follows National Collegiate Athletic Association rules, which were updated last month after Trump issued an executive order banning transgender girls from playing girls’ sports. Maine public schools are required to follow the Maine Human Rights Act, which includes gender identity as a protected class. That means students can use the pronouns and facilities aligning with their gender identity. 
Republican state lawmakers want gender identity to be removed from the Human Rights Act so that Maine can access federal funding. The Maine Principals’ Association, which governs school sports, also follows the state law and has so far declined to walk back trans’ students rights to participate in sports.

(Michael Achterling/North Dakota Monitor)A state senator wants to more than double the staff for the North Dakota Ethics Commission, arguing the state should be doing more to prevent public corruption.
The amendment was brought before the House Appropriations Committee’s Education and Environment Division on Wednesday by Sen. Tim Mathern, D-Fargo.
He said his proposal was prompted by news coverage of former Republican state Sen. Ray Holmberg’s prison sentence.
“It seems like every week, sometimes every day, there’s some sort of news story about our former colleague, Sen. Holmberg,” Mathern told lawmakers. 
Holmberg was sentenced to 10 years in prison last week after he pleaded guilty to traveling to Prague, Czech Republic with the intent to engage in commercial sex with minors. One of Holmberg’s trips to Prague was subsidized by taxpayer dollars, according to federal prosecutors. A prosecution sentencing memorandum also alleged that Holmberg arranged for commercial sex “on countless occasions” while traveling in the U.S.
Holmberg sexually exploited others, including people in North Dakota, witnesses say in court

Meanwhile, the Ethics Commission faces an unprecedented number of complaint filings. In mid-March, Executive Director Rebecca Binstock told lawmakers that the board had received 59 complaints since the beginning of the year. That’s more than the 41 filed in all of 2024.
Ethics staff have testified previously that they lack the legal authority and resources to process these complaints as quickly as they would like. 
Mathern said the state ought to do more to support the commission. He suggested adding four to five new staff members, which would cost North Dakota an additional $1.5 million for the 2025-2027 budget cycle. That would roughly double the size of its budget.
“It’s not just the fact that there are all these complaints,” Mathern said. He said not granting additional staff “will be damaging the Ethics Commission itself because it’s bogged down and can’t be really acting on much.” 
Under Mathern’s proposal, the commission would have three attorneys, an educational/communications administrator and a paralegal, in addition to an executive director. It would also include an operations manager and an administrative assistant.
The Ethics Commission currently has three staff members. The proposed budget for 2025-2027 already includes an additional employee for public education. 
Binstock said the commission hasn’t taken a stance on Mathern’s proposal, but that the commissioners do appreciate his support. She said the board’s priority for now is securing the education staff member.
Earlier in the session, the House rejected House Bill 1360, which sought to make changes the commission said would have helped it address bottlenecks in its complaint process.
The Attorney General’s Office and Gov. Kelly Armstrong’s Office testified against House Bill 1360, expressing concerns that some parts of the bill were unconstitutional. 
Mathern on Wednesday also brought up the new term limits for state lawmakers, which North Dakotans approved in a ballot measure in 2022. Under the constitutional amendment, many lawmakers will turn over in the coming years.
He said the commission will need more resources to ensure it can effectively educate new legislators. He noted that many current lawmakers are still confused about ethics rules.
Mathern also cited the need for more public education about the purpose of the commission.
“It’s coming at the late hour,” Rep. Mike Nathe, the committee’s chair, told Mathern. “I’m not knocking the idea, I’m just saying it looks like it would need more discussion.”
The committee didn’t take any action on the budget bill on Wednesday.

(Photo by Brooklyn Draisey/Iowa Capital Dispatch)Despite concerns about vague language and potential impacts reaching beyond targets of the bill, an Iowa Senate subcommittee on Wednesday advanced legislation to establish statewide general education requirements for public universities.
House File 401, which passed out of the Iowa House of Representatives in mid-March, would require state universities to develop new general education standards for students, requiring study in English, math and statistics, natural and social sciences, the humanities, western and American heritage.
According to the legislation, these courses cannot “distort significant historical events or include any curriculum or other material that teaches identity politics or is based on theories that systemic racism, sexism, oppression, or privilege are inherent in the institutions of the United States of America or the state of Iowa.” However, language directly after this section states course instructors’ academic freedoms and the free discussion of ideas in class will not be limited.
SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
Keenan Crow, director of policy and advocacy at One Iowa, asked the subcommittee during public comment to strike the section of the bill including “identity politics,” due to the lack of a definition of the term and its vagueness. Under his interpretation of the bill language, Crow said instructors would not be able to teach students about the civil rights and women’s liberation movements or the Stonewall uprising.
“I understand that a lot of this leaves room for interpretation, and maybe folks don’t agree with my interpretation, but that’s kind of my point,” Crow said. “My interpretation is just as valid as yours. Since there’s no specificity, I don’t think that’s a positive thing for educational institutions.”
Sen. Herman Quirmbach, D-Ames, agreed with Crow’s comments and added that with the current language stating instruction cannot be based on ideas that systemic oppression is inherent to U.S. institutions, teachers would also be prohibited from teaching about slavery or the time when women could not vote.
“The hypocrisy of this bill is blatant,” Quirmbach said. These two sentences are side by side … you have freedom of speech, you have academic freedom to talk about anything you want, as long as you don’t talk about things we don’t want you to talk about.”
Subcommittee chair Sen. Jeff Taylor, R-Sioux Center, said he doesn’t see anything in the legislation that would stop the teaching of the facts of U.S. history, including slavery and segregation. Since the bill puts its restrictions in the present tense, he said it only prohibits teaching the idea that systemic oppression is still inherent to U.S. institutions.
He concurred that the term “identity politics” should either be defined or removed from the bill, since it is broad.
“I know what it is, I know when I see it, but that’s different than putting it into Iowa code and specifying what it is,” Taylor said. “I think we have to have better guidance for the institutions.”
Representatives of community colleges and the Iowa Board of Regents shared concerns during the meeting that articulation agreements between colleges and universities would need to be reworked, as new standards would change what courses community colleges need to offer to ensure students are completing their general education before going to a four-year school.
Community Colleges for Iowa is registered as unopposed to the bill, and Iowa Board of Regents State Relations Officer Jillian Carlson said the board has changed its stance from “undecided” to “in favor,” as the House took many of the board’s suggestions in refining the bill.
Another concern Carlson reiterated from previous meetings was the different definitions of diversity, equity and inclusion listed in different pieces of legislation. Carlson asked for clarity on the issue.
Taylor said he understood the articulation agreements would need work if the legislation passes, which could pose problems, adding that he appreciated the addition of American and western history as general education requirements.
He and Sen. Julian Garrett, R-Indianola, signed the bill to move it to the full Iowa Senate Education Committee.
“It’s possible that the bill may need to be tweaked a little bit before it reaches the floor, but I would like to see the bill continue to move forward,” Taylor said.

House Bill 121 would restrict access to bathrooms based strictly on biological sex. (Micah Drew/ Daily Montanan)A district court judge in Missoula on Tuesday temporarily blocked state officials from enforcing a new Montana law restricting access to public restrooms, changing rooms and sleeping spaces based on an individual’s sex assigned at birth.
Missoula District Court Judge Shane Vannatta’s ruling said a temporary restraining order on House Bill 121 is warranted and will preserve the status quo until the court can rule on a motion for a preliminary injunction. The court scheduled a hearing for April 21.
Gov. Greg Gianforte signed HB 121 last Thursday, praising the legislature’s speedy passage of a bill that safeguards “fairness, privacy and security for women and girls.”
The same day, the ACLU of Montana filed a lawsuit on behalf of five transgender and intersex individuals from across Montana who would be “immediately” impacted by the “terrible law,” according to the organization’s legal director, Alex Rate.
The Governor’s Office did not respond to a request for comment on the lawsuit.
The law, introduced by Rep. Kerri Seekins-Crowe, R-Billings, applies to all public facilities and those that receive public funding, including correctional centers, juvenile detention facilities, local domestic violence programs, public buildings, and public schools. It includes leased public spaces and covers libraries, museums, hospitals, and university buildings.
In the suit, the five plaintiffs allege HB 121 violates their rights under the state constitution including “the rights to equal protection, privacy, to pursue life’s basic necessities, and due process.”
If implemented, the bill “would make it difficult, if not impossible, for transgender and intersex Montanans to participate in public life — to work, attend school, go to the courthouse or the Motor Vehicle Division, or visit a library or state park,” the complaint states, and essentially “excludes intersex people from these facilities altogether.”
The bill, Vannatta wrote, “is motivated by animus and supported by no evidence that its restrictions advance its purported purpose to protect women’s safety and privacy.”
But the law, along with another law barring transgender individuals from participating in sports aligning with their gender identity, have been priorities for the Republican majority in the Legislature, as seen by the bills’ swift passage through both chambers.
HB 121 was one of the first bills heard during the 69th Legislative session, and Gianforte also made it a major point in his State of the State speech in January.
Speaker of the House Brandon Ler, R-Savage, said when the bill was signed that the measure represented a “common sense” victory and showed that “in Montana, we still believe in biological reality.”
Vannatta said the plaintiffs had shown “at least serious questions going to the merits” of their claims, and that they “are concretely harmed” by the law’s denial of access to facilities that align with their gender identity.
The order also states that intersex people, who do not fit the law’s definitions of male and female, “do not know whether they are permitted to use any sex-separated facilities at all.”
A hearing on the plaintiffs’ motion for a preliminary injunction is scheduled for 1 p.m. on April 21 in the Missoula County Courthouse.

They lost two races that most everyone always expected them to lose. But cutting the margins of defeat in half from elections held just four months ago is giving them hope for 2026.
“These races should have never been competitive, but we outworked them,” Florida Democratic Party Chair Nikki Fried said in a Zoom call Wednesday afternoon, referring to the candidacies of Democratic candidates Gay Valimont in Congressional District 1 and Josh Weil in Congressional District 6.
“We outraised them and we slashed their margins by more than half,” Fried added. “And they panicked. They had to call Daddy [Donald Trump], hosting emergency town halls, slashing last-minute cash and even sacrificing [New York U.S. Rep. Elise] Stefanik’s nomination [as U.N. ambassador] to protect their very slim majority.”
In CD1 in the Panhandle, former state Chief Financial Officer Jimmy Patronis defeated Valimont by 15 percentage points, 57%-42%. In Northeast Florida’s CD6, former GOP state Sen. Randy Fine defeated Weil by 14 percentage points, 57%-43%.

Democrats spent far more money in both races despite the fact that the districts rank among the most Republican in the state — Trump won both districts by more than 30 percentage points last November. Nevertheless, Weil’s 14-point loss to Fine was 18 points closer than Democrat James David Stockton got in losing to then-Republican incumbent Mike Waltz in the same district just five months ago.
Republican Party of Florida Chair Evan Power dismissed the Democrats’ spin, saying, “We took everything that the Democrats had and we gave it back, and we won by double-digits.”
“We won big in record numbers in Florida last time, and getting people to turn out to vote right after they delivered a big victory is always hard,” Power told Newsmax.
“Special elections in Florida have always been close. This wasn’t close, even though they spent millions and millions of dollars. The Florida GOP, our grassroots teams made 400,000 calls, knocked on thousands of doors, and I think that everyone was united to the fact that they wanted to send a message that President Trump needed Floridians to go support him in Washington, D.C., and they sent two great ones in Jimmy Patronis and Randy Fine.”
Fried disagreed, saying that the Florida outcome “is a warning sign for Republicans in Florida and around the country, and it should send shivers to the spine of any Republican, in an R-plus-15 seat or below. There are no more safe seats in Florida.”
‘He repels people’
Meanwhile, Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis saw the closer margin of victory for Fine on Tuesday was a reflection of his weakness as a candidate and not a referendum on the president’s first two months in office.

During an appearance in Ocala Wednesday morning, the governor bashed Fine as a “squish” for supporting the 2018 Marjory Stoneman Douglas Public Safety Act and for opposing his proposal on illegal immigration earlier this year (as did the majority of the GOP-controlled Legislature initially but they later approved a watered-down bill).
“So when people see that, our base voters don’t get excited about that,” DeSantis said.
“You’re not giving them a reason to go out and vote. And also the way that he conducts himself, he repels people. He repels people in the Legislature. They wanted to get him out of the Legislature so they asked me to put him up for Florida Atlantic [University] president. I did, and the whole board would have resigned rather than make him president,” he continued.
“So, it was unique problems with this candidate that was causing it to be a close race, and I think it was trending to be a lot closer. Then what happened was they put a lot of money in a Trump plus-30 seat. They shouldn’t have had to do, but they did. And then the president did a couple of tele-town halls where he said, ‘Listen, for my agenda, I need you to go out and vote.'”
Fine responded via X, writing, “A dying star burns hottest before it fades into oblivion. I’m focused on working with @realDonaldTrump to stop Democrats from taking this country backwards, not working with them. Let’s go.”
Democratic National Committee Chair Ken Martin promised that the resources the party brought to the Florida races will continue into next year’s midterms.
“You’re going to continue to witness a level of aggressive investment in organizing from this DNC that’s unlike anything that we’ve done before,” he said on the Zoom call, organized by the DNC. “Last night’s special elections in Florida show Trump, Musk, and Republicans that they’re in trouble even in the reddest districts.”
Worthy investment?
The fact that Democrats spent so much money (Weil raised more than $10 million and Valimont more than $6 million) was mocked by Republicans but was controversial with some Florida Democrats, too, who questioned whether it was a worthy investment.
“There’s easily been 2x as much money donated in these races as donated to the FL Dem Party for voter reg since Obama12,” Tallahassee Democratic strategist Steve Schale wrote on X Tuesday night. “Until people get excited about funding infrastructure, it’s going to be a long road back.”
Fried maintained that the money made a difference, even though her party came up short in both races.
“I heard Republicans say, ‘Well, it was a waste of money. They spent $20 million on these races and we still won.’ But they don’t understand this, these races, came down to the wire because we invested in them,” she said Wednesday.
“Put money into a strong ground game and organized in red counties like never before. Investment on the ground matters. Money spent in specials was largely on the ground, not TV,” she continued.
“So, don’t tell me Florida is too expensive. We have proven that we can raise the money and spend it wisely. … We put a down payment on our future, and we’re going to make Republicans pay for it in the long run.”

West Virginia Legislative Photography)The West Virginia House of Delegates has narrowly passed a bill that would allow the Legislature to set its own rules for disclosing public records. Delegates approved House Bill 3412 with a 58 to 42 vote Wednesday.
The bill, sponsored by House Speaker Roger Hanshaw, R-Clay, would exempt the Legislature from requirements of the Freedom of Information Act, if it adopts its own rules. Some of the discussion included concerns over FOIA requests bogging down the Legislative staff’s workload. 
A search of the Secretary of State’s Office’s FOIA database show that, so far this year, five FOIA requests have been made of the Senate and none had been made of the House of Delegates. 
Lawmakers who opposed the legislation included Del. Larry Kump, R-Berkeley, who said the bill was the subject of lots of feedback from his constituents. Some of the commentary was that lawmakers who support the bill should not campaign on transparency, and that the public has a right to know what delegates are doing. 
“Perhaps the best way I can say it is, I do not like this bill,” Kump said. “I do not like it. I do not like it at all. Foxes should not be guarding the hen house. I think this bill should fall.”
The Freedom of Information Act allows journalists, researchers and members of the public to obtain access to lawmakers’ emails, presentations and more that can shed light on how decisions are being made. The emails can reveal what lobbyists or special interest groups are involved in bill making. Some communications are exempt. 
Current state FOIA law does not differentiate between the state’s court system, the executive branch and the Legislature, Hanshaw told lawmakers when the Rules Committee took up the bill. He told Rules Committee members individuals often use FOIA to access drafts of bills that are never introduced. Hanshaw wants the House to write rules that make it clear to the public what is and is not a public record.
Ann Ali, deputy chief of staff and communications director for the House of Delegates, said previously that the intent of the bill is not to hide public records and that Hanshaw wants any legislative records currently available to the public to remain available to the public.
The bill states that the Freedom of Information Act stays in effect unless the Legislature enacts its own rules, said Del. Clay Riley, who presented the bill Wednesday. 
Dels. Mike Pushkin, D-Kanawha, and Evan Hansen, D-Monongalia, raised concerns about what recourse people who request information but don’t get it would have under a legislative rule. Under current law, the person could file a lawsuit for the information. 
Riley said he couldn’t answer the “hypothetical question,” because the rules have not been passed yet. 
Hansen said he had concerns about the bill. 
“There are no guardrails on the rulemaking process other than the fact that we vote on it,” he said. “We could pass a rule that’s similar to what the current statute is. We could pass a rule that’s very different and protects all of our records from public disclosure, and that’s not right. We should play by the same rules as everybody else in government.”
Riley disagreed with the assertion that the law is more transparent than legislative rules. He pointed to the House making available audio archives of committee meetings as examples of the House being transparent. 
“Every vote, every committee meeting, is open to the public,” he said. “You know, this is a process of where we have the ability to clarify in our rules of which we govern ourselves what is and what isn’t, a legislative record. All executive branch documents are not like all legislative branch documents, and for that, Mr. Speaker, I urge passage.”
The bill will next go to the Senate for consideration.

Despite opposition from  medical, mental health, and legal experts, the Georgia Senate passed these [&#8230;]","Opponents of legislation that would place restrictions on transgender Georgians gathered across from the state Capitol in January. Ross Williams/Georgia RecorderAs the 2025 legislative session comes to a close, transgender Georgians continue to be  relentlessly targeted by state legislators, including with Senate Bill 30, Senate Bill 39, and Senate Bill 185, all of  which would restrict access to evidence-based medical care. Despite opposition from  medical, mental health, and legal experts, the Georgia Senate passed these bills, handing them off to the House for consideration. 
SB 39, a vaguely worded and wide-ranging bill, inserts lawmakers directly into the patient provider relationship. It would prevent access to any health care deemed “transition related” for more than half a million state employees and their dependents who rely on the State Health Benefit Plan, as well as others who receive care that is state funded. The breadth of its impact regarding state associated funding is unclear, and perhaps that is the  point, allowing its sweeping prohibition to be as widely applicable as possible. Likewise, what qualifies as “transition-related” care is similarly unclear, risking the restriction of  funds for a wide range of medical care. At a House Health Committee hearing on March 26,  when questioned about whether SB 39 would prevent access to mental health care, Sen.  Blake Tillery, the bill’s sponsor, stated “If not aligned with one’s sex at birth, then I think  yes.” 
To push through the myriad of anti-transgender legislation prior to the end of the session,  SB 39 has adopted language from SB 185, a bill that specifically prohibits gender-affirming  care for transgender adults who are incarcerated in Georgia, including medications that  were previously prescribed by their medical provider. To protect the health of transgender  individuals, we must prevent these bills becoming law. 
Ignoring Evidence-Based Medicine 
As medical and mental health providers, we believe all patients deserve access to high quality, evidence-based medical care. For many transgender people, gender-affirming  care is essential and lifesaving. Numerous studies demonstrate the indisputable benefits of gender-affirming care for transgender patients, including reduced symptoms of anxiety  and depression, less psychological distress, lower risk of suicidal thoughts, and better  interpersonal relationships. Every major medical and psychological association in the U.S.,  including the American Medical Association, the Endocrine Society, the American  Psychiatric Association and the American Psychological Association, among others,  recognize the evidence basis supporting the medical and psychological necessity of  gender-affirming care. These bills inappropriately insert legislators into medical decision making, infringing on the rights and well-being of transgender patients.
Taking away individuals’ access to gender-affirming therapies while in prison constitutes  cruel and unusual punishment and increases the likelihood of abuse and detrimental health consequences. Abrupt cessation or forced weaning of medically necessary,  ongoing treatment is a health risk. Physical effects of hormone withdrawal are  accompanied by psychological distress, which may manifest as anxiety, depression, and  suicidality. These bills risk the forced detransition of individuals who may have consistently taken gender-affirming hormone therapy for years. This physically and  psychologically damaging experience is unnecessary and profoundly harmful. 
Banning  care behind bars 
Transgender people often endure significant discrimination, economic insecurity and, in  some cases, homelessness. These vulnerabilities make it more likely that transgender  individuals will face criminalization and incarceration. Within the criminal legal system,  transgender people experience further marginalization and discrimination. It is common for transgender individuals to be dangerously and illegally placed in prison facilities  misaligned with their gender, increasing risk of harassment and violence. They are also  less likely to receive necessary services, including personal care items and essential  medical care. At least one in three transgender people in prisons and jails have reported  being sexually assaulted. The danger is much greater for transgender females, with almost  50% reporting harassment, physical violence, or sexual assault while incarcerated. These  statistics are likely an underestimate as some prison staff facilitate and perpetuate  violence towards transgender individuals, making it dangerous to report abuse. Often, the  only “protection” offered is solitary confinement, which exacerbates stigma and may  result in serious mental health consequences. 
The U.S. Department of Justice has determined that Georgia’s prisons fail to reasonably  protect incarcerated people from harm, violating their constitutional rights. SB 185 would prohibit the state from funding medically necessary gender-affirming therapies, including hormone therapy, for transgender people who are incarcerated. All people who are  incarcerated in Georgia have a right to medically necessary care, not only those deemed  deserving by state politicians. Multiple lawsuits brought against the Georgia Department  of Corrections as well as departments in several other states have resulted in courts ruling that transgender individuals who are incarcerated have a right to access gender-affirming  care. Prior discrimination lawsuits involving transgender people in Georgia have cost  taxpayers more than $4 million since 2015, including cases brought by transgender people  who were unable to access medical care while incarcerated. SB 39 and SB 185 run counter  to established precedent and medical expertise. This would not only worsen the health of transgender individuals in Georgia but also continue a track record of costly litigation paid  for with taxpayer dollars. 
Reject politicization of patient health care 
The bills are dangerous and discriminatory and create new problems for the state while addressing none. By dismissing medical expertise and interfering with  the patient-physician relationship, the Georgia Legislature once again seeks to make  Georgians’ health decisions for them. Lawmakers should devote their time and the state’s  resources to improving healthcare gaps currently impacting millions in our state. This  legislation targets the rights and wellbeing of transgender people, who are made  vulnerable by widespread societal stigmatization. Under the guise of fiscal responsibility, this paternalistic legislation seeks to politicize medical care at the expense of a marginalized patient population. It is incumbent upon all Georgians who respect a  patient’s right to make their own medical decisions with their physician and oppose state sanctioned discrimination against minoritized groups, to contact our state legislators and  urge them to oppose any legislative efforts to harm transgender Georgians.

(Photo by Dana Wormald/New Hampshire Bulletin)Republican lawmakers are advancing legislation that would prohibit “diversity, equity, and inclusion” clauses in state contracts, adding the measure to the state budget as Democrats object to the late notice.
In an amendment added to the budget trailer bill, House Bill 2, Republicans on the House Finance Committee voted to block state agencies, towns, and school districts from entering into contracts that have provisions relating to DEI. 
According to the proposed law, DEI includes any program or policy “that classifies individuals based on race, sex, ethnicity, or other group characteristics for the purpose of achieving democratic outcomes.”
The law would prevent any public entity from taking action to “implement, promote, or otherwise engage” any programs or policies related to DEI, and it would block state funds from being spent on them.
It would also bar state agencies from entering into contracts with vendors that include any DEI-related provisions, and would require state agencies to submit a report by October of any current contracts it has that include those provisions.
Public schools would be prevented from DEI programs, including implicit bias training, and race-based hiring, and public schools would also need to conduct a review of all contracts that might contain those programs by October, according to the bill.
The bill emerged Monday as a last-minute amendment to the budget. The House Finance Committee is expected to vote Thursday on its final recommended version of the budget, which must be voted on by the full House on April 10. The two budget bills, House Bill 1 and House Bill 2, will then move on to the Senate.
Democrats objected that the anti-DEI amendment, brought by Reps. Rich Nalevanko, of Alstead, and Joe Sweeney, of Salem, came too late in the process and should have received a full hearing in a policy committee. 
“I simply want to point out that if the public has not said already that they want input on big decisions such as this one, and they see again that this committee is going to go ahead and jam through on literally the last day something like this without proper notice, proper discussion, and input from the community, I think they are going to lose their confidence in this body,” said Rep. Laura Telerski, a Nashua Democrat. 
Democrats also said the language was overly vague and would likely be challenged in court, which they said would cost the state in legal fees. They argued the phrase “other group characteristics” is confusing and could be read to exclude contracts and programs meant to help people with disabilities.
A similar law, known by some as the “divisive concepts law,” was passed in 2021 and was also the subject of a lawsuit. That law was struck down by the U.S. District Court of New Hampshire in May 2024 for being unconstitutionally vague; the state has appealed the decision to the First Circuit Court of Appeals in Boston.
“Good attorneys will argue on their interpretations of the words, and then a judge will determine the outcome. And the last time we took that gamble, it cost the state of New Hampshire $3 million,” said Rep. Mary Hakken-Phillips, a Hanover Democrat, referring to the litigation costs brought by the divisive concepts law. “Are we going to do that again?”
The amendment nearly didn’t pass. In an earlier vote Tuesday afternoon, the committee voted down the amendment after two Republican representatives, Jess Edwards, of Auburn, and Brian Seaworth, of Pembroke, broke with their party to oppose it. 
At the time, Edwards said he was voting against the amendment on principle, since the amendment was introduced late and did not receive a proper hearing. But later in the day, Edwards and Seaworth reversed their votes and the committee passed the amendment. Neither explained their decision publicly, but Edwards said he supports the aim of the amendment.
Edwards criticized Southern New Hampshire University, a private institution, for a course that delves in part into why white-majority neighborhoods have better health outcomes than minority-dominant neighborhoods. 
“It’s that calling out of a demographic to assign a group characteristic that doesn’t make any sense when you put it back into individual terms. It causes one to think, ‘Aren’t we supposed to be judged by the content of our character and not of our skin?’” he said.
Republican House Finance Chairman Ken Weyler, of Kingston, dismissed concerns about the late filing of the amendment. He pointed to a broader push against DEI initiatives by the Trump administration, and said if New Hampshire did not pass the proposed law, it could see federal funding withheld. 
“We want to make sure that we don’t lose federal money because we have something in there that lot of us don’t support anyway,” he said.",https://newhampshirebulletin.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/statehousemarchcloudy-1024x645.jpg,,,2025-04-02 18:05:13.626032

(Photo by Cami Koons/Iowa Capital Dispatch)Iowa senators amended and advanced on Wednesday a House bill aimed at protecting private property rights from eminent domain.
House representatives passed the proposed legislation last week which combines a series of bills aimed at reforming the Iowa Utilities Commission and preventing the Summit Carbon Solutions’ pipeline from using eminent domain in the state. 
Sen. Mike Bousselot, R-Ankeney, said the Senate subcommittee meeting on the issue was “long awaited.” 
Bousselot said his goal “has always been” to pass legislation that protected “all landowners” and not just those affected by certain projects, which he alleged House legislation over the past several years has done.
“House File 639, before us today focuses only on creating additional property rights for land impacted by potential hazardous liquid pipelines … but does not take into account all types of pipelines, transmission lines or power generation,” Bousselot said.
Bousselot proposed an amendment that would remove certain parts of the House bill and add language to “avoid” eminent domain by allowing a project to find voluntary easements outside of the original project corridor. 
SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
Bousselot said this would apply to “any project seeking eminent domain approval before the IUC, including pipelines, transmission lines and power generation.”
His amendment would also require the Iowa Utilities Commission to make, within one year, a decision on any project that is seeking eminent domain rights.
“By saying that decision needs to be made within one year, there’s plenty of time for fact finding, but it also means, like the court cases that are going on today, those court cases get to court faster,” Bousselot said. 
As passed from the floor, House File 639 would have: 

Increased the insurance requirements for a hazardous liquid pipeline to cover any damages to property and reimburse landowners for increases in their property insurance premiums due to the pipeline. 
Changed the definition of a common carrier, to require a hazardous liquid carrier to establish with “clear and convincing evidence” that it will transport a commodity. 
Required an Iowa Utilities Commissioner to be present at all proceedings.
Allowed any interested party, including lawmakers, to intervene in IUC proceedings.
Restricted the IUC’s ability to sanction intervenors 
Limited the length of a hazardous liquid pipeline permit to one 25-year term. 

Bousselot’s proposed amendment would strike the common carrier definition, permit limits, intervenor requirements and would adjust the insurance requirements. 
The amendment would add a requirement for the “lifetime” repair and replacement costs for drainage tile, crop loss and soil degradation. Under the proposed amendment landowners would also be able to request, and be granted, a new land representative. 
The amendment retains the requirement that a commissioner from the IUC be present at informational meetings and hearings, and the section on insurance requirements that hold operators responsible for damages caused by the projects. 
Some of the landowners said the contents of Bousselot’s amendment were “a surprise” and they questioned how the landowners outside of the corridor, or the area around a proposed eminent domain project, would be notified. 
Jake Highfill, on behalf of the American Petroleum Institute said the organization was in favor of the corridor change and that it was “common practice” for members of the institute in other states. 
Jake Ketzner, a lobbyist for Summit Carbon Solutions, urged lawmakers to vote against “any piece of legislation that changes the rules in the middle of a project.” 
Ketzner said the company has been suggesting the corridor change Bousselot proposed and appreciated the amendment, noting it would give the project a route forward in counties where it currently has 90-95% of easements secured. 
“If we have the ability to move off someone’s ground that does not want the project, currently, the only way to deal with that is restarting,” Ketzner said. “So we think what you’re suggesting makes a lot of sense.” 
Sen. Matt Blake, D-Urbandale, said he signed off on the bill in subcommittee because it was the “last train out of the station” on the private property rights issue, but he urged his colleagues to vote against the amendment, which he called a “tremendous change to the system.” 
Sen. Tony Bisignano, a Democrat from Des Moines, said he opposed the amendment because of its rushed nature, and because he felt it was not “solving property rights.”
“We haven’t had a time to talk with people, to step back and really look at it,” Bisignano said of the amendment. “These people deserve the debate on eminent domain and property rights. This is a consolation.”
He voted in favor of the amendment to “keep it alive” for floor debate, which he has pushed for earlier in the session via a failed amendment to chamber rules.
The committee voted to adopt the amendment.
“This amendment builds on the work that was found in House File 639, retaining some, adding a lot, but ultimately is a major, major addition to strengthening and protecting private property rights in Iowa,” Bousselot said.
The bill advanced to the Senate floor via a voice vote in favor. Bousselot said he intends to file an additional amendment on the floor dealing with communications.

(Courtesy of John Williams/MOFGA)A bipartisan effort to expand the rights of agricultural workers in Maine is back before the Legislature with a couple proposals on the table for a state minimum wage guarantee, overtime pay and other protections. 
“This legislation seeks to answer a question that has echoed for far too long in Maine and across our nation: How can we claim to value the labor of farm workers so essential to the food on our tables while continuing to exclude them from the most basic labor protections that every other worker is afforded?” said Sen. Rachel Talbot Ross (D-Cumberland).
The Legislature’s Labor Committee held a public hearing Wednesday for three bills that would establish a state minimum wage for agricultural workers and provide them with other rights that workers in Maine currently have including overtime pay and limits on mandatory overtime.
While those who for several years have championed this issue see it as a matter of equity, opponents argue the industry is already paying well over minimum wage while battling thin margins and federal uncertainty. This comes after some agriculture sector leaders shared their concerns Tuesday about the financial toll new tariffs from the Trump administration could take on their operations. 
Currently, agricultural workers are excluded from Maine’s wage and hours law. Legally, they are only entitled to the $7.25 federal minimum wage; however, many farm owners say they pay workers even more than Maine’s minimum wage of $14.65 an hour. 
Talbot Ross told the committee that those exclusions are the legacy of policies meant to penalize people of color. Though she emphasized that no current lawmaker is responsible for those policies, she said the state must confront that history and make a deliberate choice to do better.
She also urged the committee to advance legislation that would grant farmworkers “full” dignity, value and worth in statute. Passing legislation that does not provide agricultural workers with equal protection that other workers enjoy is not justice, she said. 
“I’m urging you not to take an easy political road and find concessions and bring only half measures of justice to this industry and to these workers,” she told the committee.
Labor advocates call Gov. Mills’ veto of her own farmworker wage bill ‘an embarrassment’

Last session, Gov. Janet Mills introduced a proposal that would have guaranteed that agricultural workers would be paid at least $14.15 an hour and have the same annual cost-of-living increases provided to other hourly workers. The bill also included expanded recordkeeping requirements for employers. 
But Mills said the Legislature made changes that left her with no other option than to veto her own bill. It wasn’t the first time Mills vetoed such a proposal. In fact, her bill was born out of recommendations from the Agricultural Worker Minimum Wage Committee, which Mills formed after vetoing similar legislation in 2023.
Minimum wage
Sen. Rick Bennett (R-Oxford), who sponsored LD 357, said he was appalled by the governor’s veto last session. His bill is identical to the one the labor committee supported last year, whichMills said she couldn’t sign off on because it would have allowed workers to take private action against their employer for wage violations, whereas her original proposal stipulated that farmworkers go through the Department of Labor to bring an action against their employer. 
On Wednesday, Bennett stood firm in his belief that agricultural workers should be entitled to a private right of action, saying that relying on the government to defend someone’s rights defies American tradition. A private right to action was a key discussion point during the public hearing, as committee members sought to gain clarity on what statute currently affords farm workers. 
“There are no careers as vital to each of us, our families and our communities as the agricultural sector,” Bennett said. “It is true what they say: No farms, no food.”
However, multiple farmers and agricultural trade associations, including those for wild blueberry, potato, dairy and apple farms, opposed the bills over concerns about their financial impact, saying that those changes could kill their farms. Many of them also said they already pay their workers somewhere between $18 and $25 an hour, well above the state’s minimum wage.

For nearly all Maine workers — except farm workers — laws regarding wages, overtime, breaks and other such stipulations are located in the same part of state statute. Those can be found in Subchapter 3 of Chapter 7 of Title 26 of the Maine Revised Statutes, commonly referred to simply as Subchapter 3.
Rather than add farm workers to that subchapter, Bennett’s proposal creates a new section of law to house agricultural worker minimum wage. Farm employers have previously pushed for this approach, arguing that any future amendments to Subchapter 3 might fail to account for the industry nuances. 
Bennett’s bill would also require employers to keep records of the hours worked by each employee and the wages paid to them. It additionally spells out penalties for unpaid minimum wages and what employees can do about it.
The Departments of Labor and Agriculture, Conservation and Forestry testified neither for nor against the bill. Labor Commissioner Laura Fortman said the administration “firmly supports” ensuring that agricultural workers earn at least the state’s minimum wage, but suggested it may be more inclined to support a bill mirroring Mills’ proposal from last year that was not heard Wednesday but is expected to be coming down the pike.
Overtime and concerted activity
Talbot Ross took a different approach than Bennett to farmworker rights with LD 589. Rather than creating a new section of the law — which the former Speaker of the House said invokes the separate but equal legal doctrine that was used to perpetuate discrimination — her bill removes the language that exempts agricultural workers from the current minimum wage law. 
The proposal also includes overtime protections and a phased in overtime wage for agriculture employees. 
While the Department of Labor is neither for nor against, Commissioner Amanda Beal from the Department of Agriculture, Conservation and Forestry opposed the bill. She said overtime is “economically impossible” for farmers, arguing that they would end up reducing workers’ hours to avoid having to pay an overtime wage. 
This argument was repeated by multiple farmers, who said that the seasonal work doesn’t lend itself to the same overtime regulations of other industries. With labor already the biggest expense for most farms, they also feared that having to pay more could decimate bottom lines. 
Talbot Ross’ other bill, LD 588, would give agricultural employees the right to engage in certain concerted activity, which includes talking about wages, working conditions and other employment matters with other employees or the employer.
This is similar to a bill introduced last session that ultimately split the committee along party lines. 
While her proposal didn’t go so far as to give farm workers the right to unionize, Talbot Ross said she would be OK with the committee reworking the bill to include that power.
The Maine AFL-CIO was generally in favor of the proposals, but described LD 588 as a compromise. All three of the bills were also supported by the Maine Immigrants’ Rights Coalition, Maine Equal Justice, Maine Center for Economic Policy and Pine Tree Legal Assistance. 
The Maine Organic Farmers and Gardeners Association backed Bennett’s bill, as well as the concerted activity proposal. Deputy Director Heather Spalding said the organization is generally supportive of LD 589, but would like to work with the committee to make that more tenable for farmers and other stakeholders.

While the Maine Farm Bureau is opposed to all the bills, it supports the recommendations that shaped Mills’ proposal last year. The Maine State Chamber of Commerce is also opposed.

Phil Murphy said New Jerseyans deserve stronger safeguards against rapidly evolving threats in the virtual realm.,"Gov. Phil Murphy with Francesca Mani, a Westfield High School junior whose advocacy against deepfakes helped inspire state legislation, at a bill signing event in Newark on April 2, 2025. (Photo courtesy of Murphy’s office)Gov. Phil Murphy signed legislation Wednesday imposing civil and criminal penalties on anyone who makes or shares deceptive AI-generated media known as deepfakes.
Murphy at an event in Newark said New Jerseyans deserve stronger safeguards against rapidly evolving threats in the virtual realm.
“Just about any bad actor can use artificial intelligence to produce hyper-realistic images and videos that can exploit children, teenagers, and, frankly, anyone,” he said.
The new law makes producing and sharing deepfakes a third-degree crime if they are used for an unlawful purpose — say, to harass or extort someone — with fines up to $30,000 or a maximum of five years in prison. The governor was joined Tuesday by Lt. Gov Tahesha Way and advocates like Francesca Mani.
Mani, a Westfield High School student who was a target of sexually explicit deepfakes shared by peers, helped inspire the legislation. She was recently named one of Time magazine’s 100 most influential people in AI.
Mani said the boy responsible for the deepfakes featuring her likeness was given a one-day suspension, with school officials telling her there was not much more they could do because “there are no AI laws.”
“My response: Then I’ll bring you a law. Well, Westfield High School, this one’s for you. Doing nothing is no longer an option, Ms. Asfendis,” she said, referring to the school’s principal.
The measure first passed through the Legislature and landed on the governor’s desk in January, but Murphy conditionally vetoed it over concerns about its constitutionality. Lawmakers amended it and that version passed unanimously in the Senate and by a 64-13 vote in the Assembly.
Way, who also serves as the New Jersey secretary of state and oversees the state’s elections, warned of artificial intelligence’s potential to erode public trust during election campaigns. State Attorney General Matt Platkin also emphasized the office’s role in holding bad actors accountable, calling deepfakes a “powerful tool for deception when used maliciously.”
“Together we are building a future where tech serves the public good, not those who seek to undermine it,” said Way.
New Jersey is joining a growing number of states seeking to regulate deepfakes, particularly in areas of online harassment and election security. At least 20 states enacted laws last year to regulate political deepfakes.

StebbinsIn line with President Donald Trump’s executive order instructing the United States Army Corps of Engineers to exercise emergency permitting power to facilitate the nation’s energy supply, the Corps’ Great Lakes and Ohio River Division has authorized the use of special emergency processing procedures, as opponents of Enbridge’s Line 5 pipeline warn against placing the company’s controversial tunnel project on the fast track. 
Enbridge’s Line 5 pipeline stretches from northern Wisconsin to Sarnia Ontario, carrying more than 22 million gallons of light crude oil and light synthetic crude through the Straits of Mackinac daily. 
In 2018, the pipeline was dented in three places by an anchor strike. Enbridge later agreed to replace a four-mile section of the dual pipelines running through the Straits of Mackinac with a new segment housed in a concrete-lined tunnel located in the bedrock beneath the lakebed in order to contain any potential oil spills. 

However, opponents have continued to call for a shut down of the pipeline, raising concerns about how construction would impact nearby wetlands and warning the pipeline’s contents carry risks for explosion within the tunnel, leading to a spill.
In February, members of the anti-Line 5 coalition Oil and Water Don’t Mix raised alarms that the project would be expedited under Trump’s executive order. The Coalition argued this move would undermine the extended environmental review the Corps is conducting for the project.

In order for the tunnel project to begin construction, it must receive permits from three agencies, the Department of Environment Great Lakes and Energy, the Michigan Public Service Commission and the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, or USACE. 
In 2023, the Army Corps of Engineers announced it would extend its environmental review for the tunnel project, with plans to issue a draft environmental impact statement this spring. With the Corps’ website previously listing the project for emergency permit consideration, Oil and Water Don’t Mix has called on the USACE to maintain its full environmental review process, ensure meaningful opportunities for public participation and reject any efforts to classify the project as an emergency in need of expedited review.
On Monday, the Corps’ Great Lakes and Ohio River Division announced each of its seven districts is authorized to use special emergency processing procedures, including the Detroit district overseeing the permitting process for the tunnel project. 
The USACE’s website no longer lists the project among those under consideration for emergency permitting. At the time of publication the Corps lists the efforts as pending review for its environmental impact statement. It has not announced whether it will move forward with the permit for the tunnel project using emergency processing provisions.
Debbie Chizewer, a managing attorney at Earthjustice, which has opposed Enbridge in several cases involving Line 5, said they were not surprised to see the Corps is moving forward with an emergency process.
However, neither the executive order nor emergency provisions excuse the Corps from complying with the Clean Water Act, the National Environmental Policy Act, and the National Historic Preservation Act, Chizewer said. 
“If the Corps advances the Line 5 tunnel project through this process, we expect them to comply with the law. The truth is there is no national energy emergency, and even if there was, Line 5 is a pipeline that transports Canadian oil primarily to Canada. It will not affect the US energy supply. The state of Michigan can still do the right thing and reject permits for this dangerous project,” she said. 
According to the U.S. Energy Information Administration, the United States has led the globe in oil production since 2018. 
Carrie La Seur, the legal director for For Love of Water, or FLOW, which advocates for the protection of the Great Lakes, similarly said that an emergency declaration is not carte blanche for the corps to ignore environmental law. 
She noted Trump’s executive order relies on the National Emergencies Act, which requires periodic Congressional review and has a two-year sunset, alongside other emergency powers that require agency heads to make findings.
“Use of those emergency powers could be challenged as arbitrary and capricious (arguing that the alleged energy emergency is a sham) under the federal Administrative Procedure Act,” La Seur said in an email to the Advance. 
She also pointed to a breakdown of Trump’s executive order from Columbia Law School’s Sabin Center for Climate Change Law, which notes that federal pipeline safety laws allow waivers based on certain findings, leaving an opening for legal challenges. 
When asked if the company had received any updates from the USACE on whether the tunnel project would be subject to emergency processing, Enbridge spokesperson Ryan Duffy directed the Advance to a previous statement, where he emphasized that the pipeline is critical energy infrastructure.
“The State of Michigan has provided its environmental permits for the project, and the Michigan Public Services Commission (MPSC) has approved placing the new pipeline segment in a tunnel as Line 5 crosses the Straits of Mackinac. However, after nearly five years, the project still awaits action by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers on an environmental impact statement and a permitting decision,” Duffy said. 
Enbridge has already received a permit from the Michigan Public Service Commission, which was upheld by the Michigan Court of Appeals after the Bay Mills Indian Community, Grand Traverse Band of Ottawa and Chippewa Indians, Little Traverse Bay Bands of Odawa Indians, and Nottawaseppi Huron Band of the Potawatomi challenged the decision alongside several environmental and clean water groups.

Although EGLE granted Enbridge’s tunnel project permits in 2021, the company must redo its water resources permit as part of a legal agreement with the department and the Bay Mills Indian Community. EGLE Strategic Communications Advisor Scott Dean told the Michigan Advance Wednesday that EGLE is currently reviewing two applications for construction activities related to the tunnel, including a joint permitting application covering its Wetlands Protection and Great Lakes Bottomlands permits. 
EGLE is also considering Enbridge’s National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System permit, with its current permit set to expire on Oct. 1, 2025. This permit aims to protect water quality by imposing limits on the amount of pollutants that can be discharged into a body of water.

While momentum builds at the city level — with Portland, Oregon; Providence, Rhode Island; and San Diego exploring similar laws — statewide bans have been slower to emerge.
The legislation targets tools such as RealPage’s YieldStar, which uses landlord-shared data to recommend rent increases — a practice critics say worsens unaffordable housing. Stateline reported last year that the algorithms have drawn increasing oversight attention as the country continues to wrestle with an affordable housing crisis.
“This wave of action shows that local governments are stepping up where federal enforcement takes time,” said Ivan Luevanos-Elms, executive director of Local Progress, the national network helping coordinate these efforts.
In 2024, proposed legislation failed to prohibit the use of these algorithms stalled in  Illinois, New York and Rhode Island.
Washington state has seen the most movement, with a proposed ban passing the Senate and awaiting a House vote. Colorado’s House approved a similar bill this week, and it’s now headed to the Senate.
Elsewhere, New York Democratic Gov. Kathy Hochul has proposed legislation to ban algorithmic rent-setting tools, while Oregon lawmakers are considering an expansion of city-level bans. Lawmakers in Arizona, California, Idaho, Illinois, Georgia, New Hampshire, Hawaii have introduced bills, but none has advanced.
The legislative surge follows lawsuits against RealPage and six major landlords, accused by the U.S. Department of Justice and 10 state attorneys general of collusion and anticompetitive practices. But with court cases expected to drag on for years, cities are opting for faster action.
Still, these bans have met resistance from real estate and landlord groups. In Oregon, landlords and property managers argue the software helps manage rentals more efficiently.
“Without these tools, we must rely on outdated methods,” said Oregon landlord Aaron Douglas in submitted testimony. “This isn’t just an inconvenience; it’s a step backward.”

Allen Chesser (R-Nash) discusses a child welfare bill (Photo: Lynn Bonner)Marcella Middleton was in and out of foster care from ages 2 to 21, with more than 16 placements in North Carolina alone. 
She was at the Legislative Building on Wednesday speaking in support of a bill she thinks would have helped shorten her stay in the foster care system. 
A social worker “took adoption off the table” for her, Middleton said. “I had no avenue to advocate for myself.”
A bipartisan bill seeks to shore up some of the weaknesses in the state’s child welfare system through a multi-pronged effort focused on more efficiently moving children out of foster care and into permanent homes and helping prevent them from remaining in unsafe homes.
“What we are focused on in this bill are the life outcomes for children, so we are focused on an environment that is conducive to permanency and reunification, when possible,” said Rep. Allen Chesser (R-Nash), the bill’s lead sponsor. 
The state Department of Health and Human Services sets child welfare policies, but it’s the responsibility of counties to administer them. The decentralized system leads to variations in county operations and decisions. 
“With 100 counties doing it 100 different ways, it makes it very difficult to have standardization of service, standardization of care, standardization of mental health across North Carolina,” said Rep. Donnie Loftis (R-Gaston). “Hopefully, this bill starts the process of getting us all on the same page.”
Under the bill:

County social services directors would have to tell people who report child abuse or neglect within five days whether the office of child protective services is checking into the allegations and reasons for the decisions. People who report child abuse would be able to ask the state to review county decisions when directors decide not to follow up. 
Parents would no longer have their parental rights terminated for failure to pay for the care of their children while the children are in county custody. 
Before representing county social services agencies, lawyers would have to take six hours of mandatory specialized training. The training would be required each year. 
Open adoptions would be allowed, if both the adoptive parents and birth parents agree. Courts would be able to modify or terminate the agreements. The agreements would end when children turn 18 or are otherwise emancipated. 
Foster parents or relatives who have cared for children for at least a year and want to adopt them would have the chance to talk to judges before child care workers remove the children for a new placement. 
The state Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS) would be able to review open and closed cases in counties as part of regular monitoring or in response to complaints. County Department of Social Services directors would be notified of violations of rules and laws. If the problems aren’t remedied, the state would ask the county boards of commissioners, county managers, and other county officials to fix the problems. 

Foster agency operators, advocates for foster children, foster parents, and representatives from Disability Rights NC and DHHS attended the presentation of the bill. 
Lisa Cauley, director of the DHHS Division of Human Services gave a rundown of recent and soon-to-be operational advances in child welfare. 
“To truly protect children and strengthen families, we have more work to do,” she said. “This bill is a big step in moving us forward. First and foremost, it creates a new level of accountability in the child welfare system.”
It would also help smooth the path toward permanent, stable homes for children, she said.

Multiple parties must work together to ensure permanency for children, Cauley said. “This bill brings these systems together around the shared goal of reducing delays and securing permanency to move children out of DSS custody as safely and quickly as possible.”
Absent an immediate crisis, sweeping changes to the state’s child care system have been difficult and slow.
Chesser said the bill took about 16 months to develop. 
“It is something that a lot of blood, sweat and tears, and I would say love has been poured into,” he said. “Our goal here is to overcome some of the political obstacles we have faced in the past and actually move the needle for the children who need it the most, and that is the children who are in foster care.”
Middleton is now CEO of the nonprofit A Way Home America, which advocates for federal policies to reduce youth homelessness. 
The bill’s provisions would have helped her, she said, and would help the young people she works with today.

(Photo by Alexander Castro/Rhode Island Current)Breast cancer is among the most common cancer diagnoses in Rhode Island, making up about 13% of diagnoses each year as well as 7% of all cancer deaths.
Early detection can make a difference. South Kingstown Democratic Rep. Kathleen Fogarty is sponsoring a bill that she hopes will make mammograms, which can help with early detection, more accessible and affordable by prohibiting insurers from levying out-of-pocket costs for the diagnostic tests. 
“Breast cancer is the most commonly diagnosed and leading killer of Black women,” Fogarty said. “Despite a lower incidence rate, Black women have a 38% higher mortality rate than white women, which I think is just disgraceful. So we really need to help out all women.” 
According to the state health department, more than 91% of women diagnosed with breast cancer for the first time live at least five years after being diagnosed. 
Fogarty knows firsthand the value of early detection.
“I will share with you that I was just diagnosed with early uterine cancer, and I am actually going in tomorrow for surgery,” Fogarty told the crowd gathered in the State House Library on Tuesday. “So when doctors tell you, if you have any bleeding in your postmenopausal, make sure you go back to your doctor, because that’s what I did.” 
Fogarty shared her experiences as a featured speaker at the American Cancer Society’s Cancer Action Network (ACS CAN) advocacy day at the statehouse.   
“I had a sister who’s a nurse who stayed on top of me, and hopefully we’re going to get it early enough, but tomorrow I go in for surgery,” Fogarty continued. “I am with all of you in your fight against cancer here in Rhode Island.”
Uterine cancer, when detected early, has a five-year survival rate of 95%, according to the National Cancer Institute. Averaged across different demographics and stages of disease severity, over 80% of diagnosed patients live for at least five years from diagnosis. Still, disparities exist in how cancer is diagnosed and treated, something Fogarty pointed to in her remarks.  
The same applies to other forms of cancer, too. Uterine cancer mortality rates, for instance, decreased for decades until rising across all demographic groups, according to a 50-year, population-based analysis published in 2023 in the journal Obstetrics and Gynecology. Non-Hispanic Black and Hispanic women ages 30 to 39 had the highest annual increases, at 3.3% and 3.8% respectively, in uterine cancer mortality from 2001 to 2018, the study noted. 
Fogarty’s bill — along with its twin in the Rhode Island Senate, Bill S0197 by Providence Democratic Sen. Sam Zurier, is one of three lobbied for by the American Cancer Society’s Cancer Action Network in Rhode Island this year. The ACS estimates that 7,500 Rhode Islanders will receive cancer diagnoses this year, and it predicts 2,100 people in the state will die from the disease.  
“We should be making it easier, not harder, for Rhode Islanders to afford medications, screenings, treatments that they need,” Ryan Timothy Strik, ACS CAN’s government relations director in Rhode Island, said Tuesday.
A third bill, this one from East Providence Democratic Sen. Robert Britto, would essentially force insurance companies to deduct copay assistance payments from patients’ deductibles for medications. 
That would help Paul Adam, an American Cancer Society volunteer who told the crowd about his experience with the expensive biologic drugs. Biologics are derived from living organisms and often carry special handling and storage requirements. They have been a major driver of pharmaceutical development in the past two decades, and are used in a variety of hard-to-treat conditions, from cancers to autoimmune disorders like arthritis — an ailment for which Adam said he gets shots twice monthly.   
The drugs also tend to be expensive: Adam said his copay is $2,400 until his deductibles are met.
“Fortunately, I’ve been able to benefit from copay assistance, which essentially covers my copay in full,” Adam said. “However, my insurance company stepped in. Without notice, they stopped applying my copay assistance to my deductible, all because it was coming from a third party.”
Drug manufacturers have long offered copay assistance programs to offset the cost of the expensive drugs they manufacture. Insurers have retaliated in recent years by leveraging tools like copay accumulators. A 2024 review in the Journal of Managed Care and Specialty Pharmacy broke it down like this: Under a manufacturer assistance program, an insurer might pay $16,000 and the manufacturer $8,000 for a drug that costs $24,000 a year. With a copay accumulator in place, the cost might be split evenly between patient, manufacturer and insurer, at $8,000 apiece.
This is the third year Adam has rallied for the bill. 
“I find myself with significant medical debt after three years, and more recently, had to go without my medication for six months,” Adam said. “People shouldn’t have to choose between paying their bills, putting food on the table and affording medications or screenings or treatments.”
Cancer doctors have also expressed dissatisfaction with the pharmacy benefit managers (PBMs) used by insurers to dispense and manage prescriptions for specialty drugs like biologics or newer cancer treatments. In a 2024 survey from Oncology News Central, 50% of the oncologists surveyed said they strongly supported legislation that would regulate PBMs ability to deliver cancer drugs.  
All three bills have been heard in committee hearings in their respective chambers as of Tuesday, and all three have been held for further study, as is standard practice for bills when first introduced.

The president did not mention carve-outs in his remarks.Trump introduced the taxes on imports with fanfare Wednesday in the White House Rose Garden, where he said, “This is Liberation Day.”“April 2, 2025, will forever be remembered as the day American industry was reborn,” Trump said.Republican lawmakers, including House Speaker Mike Johnson of Louisiana and Georgia U.S. Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, attended the event alongside several of Trump’s Cabinet members and representatives from the United Auto Workers.The White House has circulated figures claiming the U.S. will raise up to $600 billion in revenue per year as a result of the tariffs — an estimate met with skepticism by economists.This is a developing report that will be updated.",,,,2025-04-02 17:06:34.589454

Republicans looking to cut federal spending on Medicaid are eyeing work requirements as one possible option. (Justin Sullivan/Getty Images)Under an emerging Republican plan to require some Medicaid recipients to work, between 4.6 million and 5.2 million adults ages 19 to 55 could lose their health care coverage, according to a new analysis.
The study, conducted by Urban Institute researchers with support from the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation, calculated that up to 39% of the 13.3 million adults in that age group who became eligible for Medicaid when their states expanded the program under the Affordable Care Act would lose coverage if Congress required states to impose work rules.
The report suggests that most of those people would lose coverage not because they aren’t complying with the rules, but because they would struggle to report their compliance to the state.
“Most adults who would lose eligibility for federal Medicaid funding are working, engaged in work-related activities, or could qualify for exemptions not readily identifiable through state databases but could still face disenrollment because of the reporting requirements,” it states. The study identified several barriers to reporting, including lack of broadband access and lack of transportation.
Forty states plus the District of Columbia have expanded Medicaid under the ACA. Overall, nearly 72 million people, about a fifth of Americans, are enrolled in the program for low-income people, which is funded jointly by the federal government and the states.
Holdout states consider expanding Medicaid — with work requirements

Traditional Medicaid insurance was mainly available to children and their caregivers, people with disabilities and pregnant women. But the ACA, commonly known as Obamacare, allowed states to extend coverage to adults making up to 138% of the federal poverty level — about $21,000 a year for a single person.
Nationwide, more than 21 million people with low incomes have health insurance because of expanded Medicaid eligibility.
U.S. House Republicans in February pushed through a budget plan, now under consideration in the Senate, that would require about $880 billion in cuts to Medicaid over the next decade to help cover the cost of $4.5 trillion in tax cuts. The budget doesn’t contain specifics on how that target would be met. But work requirements are a likely money-saving option: A 2023 analysis from the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office found that imposing work rules on Medicaid recipients ages 19 to 55 who are not parents or caregivers would cut federal spending by an estimated $109 billion over the next 10 years.
The Congressional Budget Office based that projection on a plan the GOP-controlled U.S. House approved in 2023. That bill, the likely blueprint for the work requirements Republicans are considering now, would have required adults ages 19-55 to work, participate in a job training program or perform community service for at least 80 hours per month for three or more months in a calendar year. Parents and caretakers of dependent children, and those unable to work because of a health condition, would have been exempt.
Many Republican-led states are eager to impose work requirements on able-bodied Medicaid recipients. Thirteen states received permission to impose work rules on at least some Medicaid enrollees during the first Trump administration. Nine additional states requested permission to enact Medicaid work requirements during Trump’s earlier term but had not won approval by the time it ended.
When the Biden administration came into office, it rescinded all the approvals.
Supporters say requiring Medicaid recipients to work, study or train for a career gives them a boost toward self-sufficiency and financial stability. Critics, however, say such rules end up hurting far more people than they help.
Medicaid cuts could hurt older adults who rely on home care, nursing homes

The researchers from the Urban Institute mostly based their analysis on the experience of Arkansas, which in June 2018 became the first state to require some Medicaid recipients to work, volunteer, go to school or participate in job training to receive benefits. By the time a federal judge halted the policy in April 2019, 18,000 adults had lost coverage.
The researchers also looked at New Hampshire, which began implementing a work requirement but halted the program in July 2019 before suspending anyone’s coverage.
“What was found in a lot of qualitative research on the previous work requirement programs is that a lot of people were unaware of the policy, or they didn’t understand the policy,” said Michael Karpman, an Urban Institute researcher who co-authored the study.
“People who need coverage the most would do the most to try to maintain it. On the other hand, those people could also face the most difficulty with the administrative barriers,” Karpman said.
In a 2020 study examining how Arkansas’ last experience with work requirements played out, researchers from the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health “found no evidence that the policy succeeded in its stated goal of promoting work and instead found substantial evidence of harm to health care coverage and access.”
Arkansas Republican Gov. Sarah Huckabee Sanders announced in January that she would ask the federal government for permission to institute work requirements, regardless of what Congress decides. The state submitted the request last week.












Especially for a rural state like Arkansas, work requirements fail to take into account a lot of the realities that people may face.


– Christin Harper, policy director for Arkansas Advocates for Children and Families




Arkansas Republican state Rep. Aaron Pilkington, who serves on the health committee in his chamber, said lawmakers “learned our lesson from the last go-round.”
Pilkington said that under the new proposal, the state will only pause coverage instead of canceling it, giving recipients an opportunity to prove they are complying. And, he said, the online portal for reporting will be a lot more user-friendly.
“I think it’s a reasonable thing to ask for able-bodied people to look for work, or try to obtain work,” Pilkington said.
But Christin Harper, policy director for Arkansas Advocates for Children and Families, said even the new version would be a challenge for many enrollees. Many people on Medicaid are juggling multiple jobs, and having to report to the state every month would be a significant burden.
“Especially for a rural state like Arkansas, work requirements fail to take into account a lot of the realities that people may face,” Harper said. She added that “with the overall job market, job opportunities may or may not be available in some of these rural towns.”

Jeff Landry has enacted a hiring freeze for the executive branch of state government in an effort to save $20 million ahead of a projected state budget shortfall. 
The governor signed an executive order Wednesday that pauses hiring for state government departments and agencies under the governor’s control. The order does not apply to Louisiana’s judicial or legislative branches, according to Landry’s press secretary Elizabeth Crochet.
“To ensure the long-term fiscal health of Louisiana and protect essential services for our most vulnerable citizens, we must take decisive action now to address revenue shortfalls,” Landry said in a written statement. “By implementing a temporary hiring freeze, we will reign in spending, saving an annualized $20 million. This is a necessary step to give the Legislature more options, to prevent deeper cuts to health care and education, and to safeguard the future of our state.” 
Landry and state lawmakers looked to avoid a budget crunch during a special legislative session on taxes and state spending in November. They increased the state sales tax from 4.45% to 5%, effective through fiscal year 2029, and state income tax rates were lowered to a flat 3% for individuals and 5.5% for corporations.
The governor and legislators also agreed to put a constitutional amendment before voters that would have shifted certain revenue streams into the state general fund. 
In December, legislators were shown revenue projections that indicated their actions would stave off a budget deficit. That money would have likely helped address the shortfall that Landry now predicts.
But that was before voters resoundingly rejected Amendment 2 in Saturday’s election, which would have moved money from state’s savings accounts in the general fund, where it could be more easily spent.  
In addition to the failed amendment fallout, the Landry administration may have to cope with federal funding cuts that will impact the state spending plan for the 2025-26 fiscal year.

The stark differences in their budgets will need to be reconciled over the next few weeks. The two chambers will formally vote out their budgets next week.
The House-proposed budget adds up to nearly $113 billion while the Senate spending plan is nearly $117.4 billion — both less than the $118.6 billion being spent in this fiscal year’s budget. Those figures include total spending, including federal funds. 
The main reason for the wide gap is that the House wants to trim spending now and return dollars leadership claims don’t need to be spent. To that end, the House wants to cut the state’s sales taxes by roughly $5 billion — a move that if ultimately approved would cut levies Floridians pay on a wide array of goods, ranging from non-food items they buy at the grocery store to cars, but leave less to spend on programs.
“We must remove the temptation to spend,” said Rep. Lawrence McClure, chair of the House Budget Committee.
Both budget plans drew criticism for their cuts to support for access to accelerated courses at public schools, Everglades restoration, and state employees. Senate Appropriations Chairman Ed Hooper noted that state employees “will be one of the bigger issues in conference that we’re going to have to deal with.”

Drugs and money
One glaring difference when it comes to state employees is that the Senate plan includes a 4% pay increase. The House budget doesn’t include money for pay raises. “The Senate budget recognizes the importance of our state employees,” Hooper said.
The House budget eliminates positions that have been vacant for more than 90 days. The House budget funds 106,780 positions. The Senate budget also eliminates vacant positions but maintains authority for the agencies to hire those employees. The Senate budget funds 112,842 positions.
The House proposes a strict drug formulary for employees using their state insurance coverage — a move that one House Republican predicted could save $126 million.
But it was the chambers’ conflicting positions on education funding that drew the most attention, both in public testimony and discussion among the members.
Both chambers would increase bottom-line spending on education from the near-$28.6 billion being spent today. The House earmarks $29.33 billion, while the Senate version is $29.57 billion.
Most of the debate in the House committee Wednesday focused on changes the chamber would make to financing for educational options. The chamber’s proposed budget would reduce financial incentives to schools by half for every student who passes advanced placement tests, take dual-enrollment courses, or receive certifications for international baccalaureate courses.
In the current year, schools receive $865 for each student who passes an AP exam. 
Students from Rickards High School, where Leon County’s IB program is located, shared how the program changed their lives and opened opportunities for them at colleges like Cornell and Dartmouth.
Following their testimony, House Budget Committee Vice Chair Susan Valdés counseled patience.
“We heard you. This is just in the committee process,” said Valdés, who switched parties from Democratic to Republican after winning reelection in November. “This is a proposed piece of legislation — this is what’s proposed and then we go from there. So, this is not the end product. Ok? So, your voices have been heard.”
The Senate proposes reducing the funding for passing the tests by 50%, too, although schools would keep the money for other needs, if desired. Sen. Danny Burgess, chair of the  education budget subcommittee, said the Senate version is “better aligning additional program costs for advanced courses with funding provided through the bonus FTE.”
He referred to the state’s per-student financial support for public schools.










We must remove the temptation to spend.


– House Budget Committee Chair Rep. Lawrence McClure


What about taxes?
The budget represents just part of the state’s financial picture. Taxes are another. House Speaker Daniel Perez and Gov. Ron DeSantis both want to return at least $5 billion to taxpayers but disagree sharply over how to do that. Senate President Ben Albritton has refrained from embracing either side so far and is taking a more cautious approach.
Perez wants to permanently roll back the state’s sales tax from six cents on the dollar to 5.25%. DeSantis wants to eliminate property taxes next year, via a constitutional amendment placed before voters in 2026, and, in advance of  that, provide an average $1,000 rebate to the 5.1 million homesteaded properties across Florida.
“These are both significant ideas, worthy of our thought and consideration,” Albritton told his senators this week in an open letter. “However, at this point, I believe it is prudent that a final tax cut package of this size be predominantly nonrecurring, while permanent tax cuts are explored during the interim.” “Nonrecurring” means the cut would be for one year only.
The House Ways and Means Committee, meanwhile, passed the Perez tax plan unanimously on Wednesday.
Bridge the gap
While the budgets are about $4.4 billion, apart the Senate has included $200 million in a separate bill for Albritton’s “Rural Renaissance” initiative, intended to boost economies in less developed sections of Florida. That means there’s a $4.6 billion difference in proposed funding between the chambers.
The spending gap must be bridged before legislators can begin fine-tuning the budget.  Although legislators discuss hundreds of bills each session, the budget, known as the General Appropriations Act, is the only bill legislators are required to pass each year. 
Florida voters approved a constitutional amendment imposing a 72 hour “cooling off period” on the budget with the goal of allowing members time to go through the document and read the fine print. The 72-hour requirement means that the spending plan must be printed and put on members desks by April 29 if they hope to adjourn on time on May 2.

Roger Marshall of Kansas is keen to convince Congress to restore whole and 2% milk as an option for children in school cafeterias nationwide.,"U.S. Sen. Roger Marshall, R-Kansas, pours a serving of milk during a Senate committee hearing to demonstrate his desire  to return whole and 2% milk to school cafeterias. Currently, students had the option of drinking 1% or skim milk. (Kansas Reflector screen capture from Marshall's YouTube channel)TOPEKA — U.S. Sen. Roger Marshall opened a Senate committee hearing by throwing back a glass of milk to emphasize the value in altering U.S. Department of Agriculture directives so alternatives to low-fat milk could be served to school children.
“If you could just spare me a moment here, I’ve got to clear my throat a little bit,” said Marshall, while pouring milk from a small carton into a glass and gulping most of it down. “There, I can speak better now.”
Marshall, a Kansas Republican with a pre-politics career as a physician, said members of Congress often had personal reasons for seeking federal office. Marshall said he arrived in Washington, D.C., with a 10-point priority list.
“Save the world. Save Medicare. Save Medicaid. Balance the budget. And, get whole milk back in schools,” he said.
Marshall, a self-described milk lover with fond memories of consuming farm-fresh milk in Kansas, reveled Tuesday at the opportunity to repeat his December 2023 milk-drinking performance for the Senate Agriculture, Nutrition and Forestry Committee hearing on legislation rolling back USDA restrictions on school milk options.
  Eve Stoody, director of nutrition guidance and analysis division at the U.S. Department of Agriculture, said during a U.S. Senate hearing a federal dietary review panel recommended milk consumption in schools remain tied to 1% and skim varieties rather than resume distribution of whole or 2% milk. (Kansas Reflector screen capture of U.S. Sen. Roger Marshall’s YouTube channel)
 
It’s about the fat
Marshall said whole milk, which contained 3.25% fat, and reduced-fat 2% milk should be presented to children in schools along with the low-fat 1% milk and fat-free skim milk.
In 201o, Congress directed the USDA to ban whole and 2% milk in schools by modifying dietary guidelines to limit options to skim or low-fat cartons.
Supporters of USDA policy implemented in 2012 contended whole or 2% milk was higher in saturated fat and contributed to elevated cholesterol levels or increased risk of heart disease. One cup of whole milk could contain 4.5 grams of saturated fat, which covered a substantial portion of recommended daily intake for school-aged children. In addition, skeptics of whole milk said the intake of saturated fat could contribute to rising levels of obesity and type 2 diabetes in children. 
Eve Stoody, director of nutrition guidance and analysis division at USDA, said federal dietary guidelines recommended plain whole milk for infants under 2 years of age before transitioning to lower-fat milk options.
“There’s a bit of an evidence gap as to exactly when that transition to lower fat options might be most beneficial, but there’s definitely benefits of plain whole milk, particularly in young children, to supporting brain development,” Stoody said.
She said it was “very concerning” consumption of fluid milk began to decline in the early 2000s and current consumption in adolescence was about half a cup lower per day than it was two decades ago. Increasing milk consumption among U.S. youth would be a positive development, she said, and the best path would be through lower-fat options.
“Dairy is a healthy choice,” Stoody said, “but it really matters what you’re eating with that dairy. For those who eat a healthy diet, for those who are active … whole milk can be a great option.”
She said a federal dietary review panel recommended policy on milk consumption in schools remain unchanged for 2025-2030. The final standard would be determined by USDA and the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services.
Robert Kennedy Jr., secretary of HHS, said dietary guidelines requiring lower-fat milk varieties in schools were antiquated. He’s also encouraged “full fat/whole milk” to be offered in Head Start programs for the nation’s youngest children.
 
‘Most delicious’
The milk legislation endorsed by Marshall, which has earned bipartisan support, is pending in the House and Senate.
Marshall said current federal standards undermined opportunities for children to take part in a “whole-foods” movement by consuming healthy fat necessary to absorbing vitamins A, D, E and K. The senator said whole milk contained omega-three fatty acids, which supported brain health and inflammation control.
He said the Whole Milk for Healthy Kids Act should be viewed as a plank of the “Make American Healthy Again movement.” It would echo President Donald Trump’s strategy of marketing reform under the Make America Great Again brand.
In the past, Marshall described milk as the “most delicious, most nutritious wholesome drink known to humankind.” He recalled milk from his grandfather’s Holstein dairy herd was delivered to his home when growing up in Kansas.
“I don’t know that I’m aware of any good studies either proving my point, but certainly it seems to me that whole milk tastes a whole lot better,” he said.",https://kansasreflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Marshall-loves-milk-2-1024x521.png,,,2025-04-02 17:06:34.589454

The National Weather Service predicted heavy rains and flooding for northeast Arkansas and upgraded the risk of tornadoes for a large swath of the state to a five out of five, the highest amount of risk, earlier on Wednesday.
Sanders said in a news release Wednesday afternoon that $250,000 had been released from the Governor’s Disaster Response and Recovery Fund.

The release said that “severe storms, tornadoes, and flooding are expected to occur in Arkansas, and continue thereafter, which may cause danger, hardship, and suffering throughout the state, which in turn, warrants this executive action.”
The National Weather Service has warned about “generational” flooding with potentially devastating effects in the northeast region of the state, which has been hit hard by severe weather in recent weeks. Ten to 15 inches of rain are expected in some areas over the next few days. 
“Generational Flooding Possible This isn’t routine,” the weather service in Memphis, which is responsible for parts of extreme northeast Arkansas, wrote on its X account Wednesday. “This is a rare, high-impact, and potentially devastating event. Heavy rainfall will likely lead to widespread river, flash, and areal flooding that could cause severe disruptions especially along and north of I-40.”
As of early Wednesday morning, a forecast graphic released by the Little Rock office of the National Weather Service on X said that the most extreme northeast areas of the state could get between 10 and 15 inches of rainfall by Sunday. Jonesboro, Searcy and Mountain View could receive between eight and ten inches. Little Rock, Pine Bluff and Hot Springs could receive between six and eight.

Amid increasing need, the U.S. Department of Agriculture has cancelled about $4.3 million in food orders to Michigan, equating to more than 2 million meals, according to the Food Bank Council of Michigan, or FBCM.
The network of seven food banks that are members of FBCM serve communities around Michigan and are working to make up for the cancelled meals, but the sudden and unexplained cancellation by the USDA hasn’t placed the council in a good position to address food insecurity in Michigan, Executive Director of FBCM Phillip Knight told Michigan Advance.

The food banks and organizations they partner with statewide had planned around the scheduled food deliveries throughout April to August, Knight said. The orders included chicken, pork, turkey, cheese and eggs as a part of the USDA’s Emergency Food Assistance Program which is in-part funded by the federal Commodity Credit Corporation, or CCC.
The Secretary of Agriculture has full discretion over how funds are allocated, Knight concedes, but the lack of communication with food banks explaining why the cancellations happened and what the future of food supplies orders will look like doesn’t serve as a solid foundation to address future hunger across states.
Food banks and food bankers will come up with creative solutions to work around not having the expected meat, eggs and cheese, but the foods may be less substantive replacements, Knight lamented and that isn’t a trade off food banks like to make for the sake of addressing hunger in households.
“We want to do the best we can for families, not the least. We want to do the best, because we in this culture in America, we use food to communicate value,” Knight said. “When somebody’s coming to visit you, you think, ‘what can I make for them that I make really good’… because you care about them… because you love them. We use food to communicate that.”
Now the council is concerned that without a formal explanation of why the shipments were cancelled and if Michigan can plan on any future shipments, it’s unclear how food banks will overcome the strain of scrambling to find other resources and meet growing demands in communities of need. Furthermore, Knight reasoned that the farmers and food producers who would have been paid through the Emergency Food Assistance Program will likely suffer as the program also serves to stabilize food markets so any overproduction can still generate profits for producers and benefit food pantries.
As food banks in other states face similar halts on expected orders, the USDA is reporting that they are reorganizing programs to promote sustainability with more reasonable expectations. In March, Nevada received notice that federal funding for programs serving the state’s two major food banks would be cut, with the USDA decrying the usage of the Commodity Credit Corporation federal funds, according to the Las Vegas Review-Journal.
“Unlike the Biden Administration, which funneled billions in CCC (Commodity Credit Corporation) funds into short-term programs with no plan for longevity, USDA is prioritizing stable, proven solutions that deliver lasting impact. The COVID era is over—USDA’s approach to nutrition programs will reflect that reality moving forward,” a USDA spokesperson told the Las Vegas Review-Journal.
With new administrations come new rules, Knight said, and the food banks are good about tapping other community resources to accommodate when food shipments don’t work out. He added that it’s not uncommon for shipments from the USDA to be cancelled as sometimes the weather, a bad harvest or other factors impact produce, but when Michigan was expecting 123 semi trucks full of protein-filled substantive food like chicken and pork, it’s hard for the food banks to replace that sudden loss.
So now FBCM is going to rely on other resources within USDA’s Emergency Food Assistance Program that the department has made available, Knight said, but that food isn’t expected to make it to Michigan for six months.

“Why didn’t we do this more thoughtful so that it doesn’t injure the farmers, it doesn’t injure the food banks, and it doesn’t injure the families that we serve and then create a six month food gap that food banks are going to have to try to fill?” Knight said.
In the Trump administration’s pursuit of trimming down government spending and improving efficiency of federal dollars, the USDA has also cut more than $1 billion from two programs that helped food banks and school meal programs purchase food from local distributors with U.S. Agriculture Secretary Brooke Rollins calling the programs “nonessential.”
When a person is hungry or having to daily think about where their next meal will come from, they only have one problem,  Knight said. The “toxic stress” of being food insecure and having to worry about feeding your family keeps generations of Michiganders from being able to tackle how to improve their lives, access education, get a better job and make moves to get to a better place. Offering the help of food to a household creates rippling effects in a community, Knight added.
“Let’s stop thinking about people who are struggling with hunger as  a problem to be solved,” Knight said. “Instead, let’s start thinking of them as people who are worthy of an investment.”

Chellie Pingree outside the U.S. Capitol. (Rep. Chellie Pingree via Facebook) Thousands of Mainers rely on the federal heating assistance program whose entire staff the Trump administration fired on Tuesday, leaving its future uncertain. 
The Low Income Heating Assistance Program is federally funded and provides financial assistance to lower income households to reduce the cost of energy bills. 
While the program remains in effect, its roughly 20 federal staffers were among the approximately 10,000 Department of Health and Human Services workers terminated this week as part of a mass layoff to make the agency “more responsive and efficient.” 
Democratic U.S. Rep. Jared Golden responded to the firings on social media, writing in a post on X, “What ‘efficiency’ is achieved by firing everyone in Maine whose job is to help Mainers afford heating oil when it’s cold?”
For fiscal year 2025, Maine was awarded about $37.6 million in LIHEAP funding, as well as about $1.4 million for the Wabanaki Nations, according to a press release from Republican U.S. Sen. Susan Collins last fall. 
Most of that funding has already been received, however, the last 10% is funded through the continuing budget resolution Congress passed in March. 
In a social media post condemning the firings, Democratic U.S. Rep. Chellie Pingree asked, “How will LIHEAP distribute these funds (which have ALREADY been allocated by Congress) without staff? Make it make sense.” 
Without the assistance, families will have to choose between heating their homes and putting food on the table, Pingree wrote. “It’s not only callous and cruel, it defies logic,” she added. 
Lucy Hochschartner, the climate and clean energy director for Maine Conservation Voters, said long-term the state should continue to invest in clean energy and double down on efficiency measures to decrease energy costs for Mainers but that LIHEAP is what Mainers need right now.
“I can bet that the people who decided to cut the entire LIHEAP staff have never struggled to pay their heating bill,” Hochschartner said. “In Maine, it doesn’t matter who you voted for — we know that everyone deserves to stay warm during our long winters, and this is the program that makes that possible.”  
Federal cuts aside, the program in Maine is already strained. 
During a meeting of the Legislature’s Government Oversight Committee on Friday, Daniel Brennan, director of Maine State Housing Authority, told lawmakers that the state has seen an increase in applications for LIHEAP over the last five years — from 45,000 in 2019 to 70,000 in the past year — with no corresponding increase to its federal grant that provides the administrative dollars to hire enough staff to meet demand. The grant has remained at about $40 million. 
“This year has been a particularly difficult year because this year is the first year where we’ve had to face this head on, where we simply don’t have the money that the [community action programs] need to meet the higher demand of the applications,” Brennan said. 
The program puts out $675,000 on average per week, providing between 1,200 and 1,300 households with fuel assistance, he said, but a backlog of applicants remain.  
“The system is maxed out,” Brennan said.

,DC,2025-04-02 20:02:42+00:00,News From The States - Fair. Fearless. Free.,Surprise guest shows up as U.S. House Dems slam education cuts: the Education secretary,Shauneen Miranda,,,,,https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/surprise-guest-shows-us-house-dems-slam-education-cuts-education-secretary,,"WASHINGTON — A press conference by a dozen U.S. House Democrats outside the U.S. Department of Education took an unusual turn on Wednesday when the subject of their criticism — Education Secretary Linda McMahon —  unexpectedly joined them.The Democrats had met with the Trump administration appointee a few minutes earlier to press her about the sweeping shifts at the U.S. Department of Education, where she and President Donald Trump are seeking to dismantle the agency. The lawmakers told reporters that at the scheduled meeting, they questioned McMahon on how the department could carry out its primary responsibilities when the agency continues to see dramatic changes. That includes mass layoffs that hit core units and an executive order from Trump calling on the secretary to “take all necessary steps to facilitate the closure” of the department to the maximum extent she legally can.Only Congress, which established the 45-year-old department, has the power to abolish it.The Democrats said they were grateful that McMahon met with them but dissatisfied with and even alarmed by the secretary’s responses, especially on a timeline for closing the agency.“It’s very apparent that the secretary is treating this as a corporate restructuring, and we want to be clear that the education of our children is not a corporate enterprise — it is how we move this country forward,” Rep. Melanie Stansbury of New Mexico said.“It’s very clear that the (reduction in force), the firing of probationary staff, the so-called restructuring that’s happening — when we asked for a plan multiple times in this meeting, we were told there is not a plan yet,” she added.The secretary arrives, and leavesAs the Democrats spoke, McMahon emerged from the building, accompanied by aides, and joined them at their lectern emblazoned with a U.S. House of Representatives logo.She reiterated that “funding from the United States government will continue through the programs that have already been established” and said she looked forward to continuing to work with members of Congress on both sides of the aisle. After her remarks, Rep. Mark Takano pressed McMahon on when she would close the department.“Well, we’ve had our discussions already, so thank you all very, very much for coming,” McMahon replied, proceeding to walk back into the building.“You see, she’s not answering the question when she’s going to shut down the department,” Takano, of California, said as the secretary walked away.Barred from buildingWednesday’s meeting came after Takano and other Democratic lawmakers were blocked from entering the building in February while trying to meet with Denise Carter, acting Education secretary at the time, over Trump’s plans to dismantle the agency.The California Democrat had led dozens of others in writing a letter to Carter and requesting a meeting over those efforts.A day after Trump signed the executive order surrounding the department, he announced that special education services would be transferred to the Department of Health and Human Services and that the Small Business Administration would be handling the student loan portfolio.The department has not taken any steps to move either — both of which would require acts of Congress and raise a slew of logistical questions.

Rep. Jamie Raskin of Maryland said “the idea of dismembering the department and then parceling it out to other agencies and departments does not give us a lot of confidence or hope in what’s happening.”The lawmakers said McMahon repeatedly stressed during the meeting that she plans to abide by federal law and would look carefully at what she’s legally allowed to do before moving any functions of the department.Yet Rep. Greg Casar of Texas said he and the group “became more and more alarmed as the meeting went on,” noting that “current law won by so many Americans in this democracy, is that all kids deserve a decent education, that the money goes to your kid if they’re in need, the money goes to your kid no matter their race or their background or their neighborhood, and they want to change that.”The lawmakers who met with McMahon included: U.S. Reps. Terri Sewell of Alabama; Takano; Frederica Wilson of Florida; Raskin and Sarah Elfreth of Maryland; Maggie Goodlander of New Hampshire; Stansbury; Casar, Julie Johnson and Veronica Escobar of Texas; Don Beyer of Virginia; and Gwen Moore of Wisconsin.",https://www.newsfromthestates.com/themes/custom/sn/images/icons/No_image.svg,,,2025-04-02 16:05:47.057449

Senate Bill 558, led by a trio of Republicans [&#8230;]","The campus of UNC-Chapel Hill (Photo: Clayton Henkel/NC Newsline)Republican lawmakers in North Carolina are looking to define a range of “discriminatory practices” and “divisive concepts” on college campuses through a new bill, the latest in of a series of efforts by GOP leadership to eliminate diversity, equity and inclusion from all sectors of government.
Senate Bill 558, led by a trio of Republicans including the Senate leader, would seek to expand on a ban on DEI practices already put in place by the UNC System Board of Governors.
While the bill is entitled “Eliminating ‘DEI’ in Public Higher Education,” sponsor Sen. Brad Overcash (R-Gaston) argued that the measure does not bar diversity, equity and inclusion nor seek to define it.

Rather, it defines a range of “divisive concepts” and “discriminatory practices” that campuses are forbidden from endorsing or affirming — including treating a person differently “solely to advantage or disadvantage that individual.” The language is almost identical to a similar bill applying to K-12 public schools, which has passed the Senate.
Those practices and programming have “divided our campus, divided our student bodies, divided our faculties, along lines that are unnecessary and unproductive,” said Overcash.
But critics of the bill warned Wednesday that as written, it could have wide-reaching impacts on scholarship programs for minority and rural students, as well as potentially chilling classroom discussions about race and other subjects.
“The problem is, they’re defined in vague and sweeping terms,” Sen. Caleb Theodros (D-Mecklenburg) said during a Senate Education Committee hearing. “It’s not really based on the intent, it’s interpretation.”
Sen. Sophia Chitlik (D-Durham) raised questions (see the video above) about wording in the bill that purports to ban “DEI” initiatives without ever defining what the term refers to.
And Reighlah Collins, policy counsel for the ACLU of North Carolina, said the bill would hurt recruitment efforts and “result in censorship of curricula.”
Republican sponsors pushed back on those lines of criticism. Overcash said he believed scholarship programs were “apples and oranges” compared to the practices and ideas in the crosshairs of the bill.
But the chair of the committee, Sen. Michael Lee (R-Hanover), urged members to get in touch if they were concerned about specific items in the list of “divisive concepts.”

“Please come and talk to us so we make sure we understand the impact of that in this particular bill,” Lee said.
The bill would require both the State Board of Community Colleges and the UNC System Board of Governors to adopt new DEI policies to comply with the new regulations.
In May 2024, the UNC System board voted to repeal its DEI policy, replacing it with a statement of “principled neutrality.” Months later, the university had eliminated at least 59 positions in response.
And shortly after the Trump administration took office this year and purported to ban DEI through executive order, the university stopped requiring DEI general education courses, the Raleigh News & Observer reported.
Other states have pushed for similar restrictions on both K-12 schools and higher education. Last year, Alabama passed a sweeping anti-DEI law for public schools that included a ban on affirming or endorsing “divisive concepts”; two years prior, Georgia passed a similar law. And other bills with similar language have been introduced by Republican lawmakers in Missouri and Kansas, according to a tracker by Education Week.

(Courtesy images from Gov. Dan McKee's office)The previous head of the Rhode Island National Guard is Gov. Dan McKee’s latest pick to join the state’s Ethics Commission, replacing a member the governor placed on the state parole board.
Retired Maj. Gen. Christopher P. Callahan will join the nine-member volunteer panel responsible for enforcing and administering the state’s code of ethics.
Callahan retired from the military in February after decades of service — the last 10 years as the 44th adjutant general and commander of the state’s National Guard. Callahan previously served as commander of the 56th Troop Command at Camp Fogarty in East Greenwich, where he led, trained and supported 900 soldiers and six different military units. 
He also served as the director of aviation and safety at the Quonset Point Air National Guard Base in North Kingstown from 2006 to 2011 and was a battalion commander in Balad, Iraq.
In his announcement Wednesday, McKee touted Callahan’s experience and the value it would bring to the commission which has the power to fine and remove elected officials from office.
“Throughout his more than four decades of military service, General Callahan has built a proven record of fairness, integrity, and ethical leadership,” the governor said in a statement. “He will be a valuable addition to the commission, and I have full confidence that he will help uphold the highest standards of integrity in public service.” 
Callahan thanked the governor for his trust and confidence.
“I look forward to working with my colleagues on the Ethics Commission to ensure transparency and integrity throughout our state,” Callahan said in a statement. 
Advice and consent from the Rhode Island Senate is not required for the position, as no such wording was included in the 1986 constitutional amendment that created the commission. Terms on the commission are five years.
Callahan will replace Dr. Jill Hume Harrison, a sociologist at Rhode Island College who McKee appointed to the seven-member Rhode Island Parole Board. Harrison had been appointed to the Ethics Commission by McKee in August.
Harrison will take the spot of Tonya Glantz, who the governor appointed to the Parole Board in January 2024.
Harrison previously served as a consultant and researcher with the Culture of Wellness for the Maine State Prison. She also has previous experience in Rhode Island, providing seven years of meditation and cognitive behavior training to people incarcerated at the Adult Correctional Institutions in Cranston. She continues to offer onsite diversity, equity and inclusion training to cadets.
She holds a bachelor’s degree from Wells College in New York and a master’s degree from George Mason University in Virginia. She earned her PhD in sociology at the University of New Hampshire.
“I am honored to accept the governor’s appointment to serve on the state’s probation and parole board,” Harrison said in a statement. “This role presents a significant opportunity to contribute to the fair and effective administration of justice in our community.”
Senate approval is not required for appointments to the Parole Board, whose members serve three year terms and can be reappointed.

(John Sykes/Arkansas Advocate 02/28/2023)Two companies have filed applications for new brine units in South Arkansas for potential lithium extraction projects, a necessary procedural move under state law that a previous royalty application ran afoul of last year.
The companies — ExxonMobil-affiliate Saltwerx LLC and SWA Lithium, which is a joint venture between Standard Lithium and Norwegian energy giant Equinor — are asking the Arkansas Oil and Gas Commission to unitize thousands of acres in South Arkansas. 
Both companies aim to extract lithium from subterranean brines through a process called direct lithium extraction, or DLE. It’s part of a broader push nationally to obtain domestic supplies of lithium and other materials necessary for electronics of all kinds, from smartphones to electric vehicles.
But before extraction can begin, prospective lithium producers must first satisfy a key procedural requirement outlined in Arkansas law — establishing a lithium extraction royalty. Royalties are paid to property owners who agree to lease their mineral rights to the extraction companies. For the companies to establish a royalty they need to establish brine units. The unit and the royalty are necessary because of the language of the Arkansas Brine Conservation Act (ABCA) of 1979, and the Oil and Gas Commission has to approve the units and the royalties.
A brine unit is an area designated by the commission for the extraction and injection of underground brines, such as those found in the Smackover formation. 
The part of the act specifically pertaining to royalties for substances like lithium requires producers to account for the amounts extracted from each landowner’s property in the unit and establish a “fair and equitable” royalty. 
“We are excited to move our SWA Project forward with our application to form the Reynolds unit in Lafayette and Columbia counties,” wrote Jesse Edmondson, Standard Lithium’s director of government relations, in a text message. 
“Establishing a unit is a necessary step to commercially produce lithium from brine in Arkansas. After the unit is established, we will file an application to set a royalty for this unit,” Edmondson said. “The SWA Project is our primary focus in Arkansas, and we look forward to completing this process to allow a final investment decision by year end.”
Both companies previously emphasized the importance of the royalty in their decision-making; it is one of the last remaining unknown variables that the companies will have to factor in as they consider the economics of potential projects and decide whether to move forward on them.
“Establishing our brine unit is a key regulatory step to unlock the lithium industry in Lafayette and Miller counties, enabling jobs and investment potential for Arkansas,” an ExxonMobil spokesperson wrote in an emailed statement.
Both companies already tried for a royalty — Saltwerx once, Standard Lithium twice — but concerns with the applications and lack of information provided to commissioners resulted in them being rejected or withdrawn.
Last year, a joint royalty application filed by Saltwerx and Standard Lithium, alongside Lanxess, Albemarle and Tetra, asked the commission to determine a royalty for an area it described as “the Smackover Limestone Formation underlying lands within Columbia, Lafayette, Miller and Union Counties.” However, the Smackover formation is a geologic feature; not mentioned in the July 2024 application were the brine units such a royalty would apply to.
Objections filed by the South Arkansas Minerals Association argued that the Brine Conservation Act required royalties to be determined on a “unit-by-unit basis.” The association is a nonprofit composed of large southern Arkansas landowners, many of whom hold mineral rights. 
The association’s objections both on the issue of brine units and other aspects of the application ultimately led to a hearing presided over by an administrative law judge, who recommended how commissioners should interpret the law. 
The judge, Charles Moulton, agreed with the association on the matter of whether a royalty needed to be determined on a unit-by-unit basis, pointing out that the ABCA repeatedly references units in its language.
Moulton said during the hearing that he was concerned that granting a royalty without basing it on a unit could have unintended consequences.
“The concern that I have when I read the statute and when I read the application is, is the Commission unwittingly opening up Pandora’s box by establishing a royalty on a formation when they’ve never done that before? They’ve always done it on units,” Moulton said in October.
Tom Daily, the attorney representing the applicants, told Moulton the application couldn’t be based on units because some of the joint applicants did not yet have the units those companies planned to extract brine from. He said expecting the companies to form units before they had decided whether they would move ahead with lithium extraction projects was expensive.
“If we’re told we can’t even talk to you (the commission) until you have formed your units … and the result is unfavorable, that’s a lot more money wasted,” Daily said.
“I cannot amend this application to apply to units that don’t exist yet,” Daily continued. “They will exist.”
Moulton agreed, but added that the applicants could “certainly” amend it to units that did exist. He recommended that the applicants amend their proposal to specify the units they wanted the royalty to apply to.
The applicants then amended their application days before a two-day commission hearing on the lithium royalty in November, changing the language to apply to Smackover brine from existing units, along with “proposed future units.”
At that hearing, the commission ultimately adopted Moulton’s written recommendation that “the establishment of a brine unit is a condition precedent in establishing a lithium royalty under the Brine Act.” At the time, Saltwerx and Standard Lithium didn’t yet have their own established brine units. 
The Oil and Gas Commission unanimously rejected the joint application, citing a variety of concerns mostly separate from the unit establishment issue. 
By obtaining a brine unit prior to filing for the royalty again — which both companies have stated they intend to do in statements and AOGC filings — the companies would resolve one of the conflicts of law that arose during last year’s proceedings.
The areas encompassed by each company’s proposed unit are vast. SWA Lithium’s proposed Reynolds Unit is approximately 20,854 acres; Saltwerx’s proposed Pine Unit is approximately 56,245 acres.
In order to ask the commission to form a unit, applicants are required to already have 75% of the mineral rights in that area under a lease agreement. If a unit is approved by the commission, the remaining 25% would be “integrated” into the unit. According to documents filed with the commission, SWA Lithium currently has 79% of the area under lease, with that number increasing to 88% if a potential brine lease transfer agreement with Saltwerx and Tetra goes through.
Saltwerx did not provide a specific percentage of leases in the area of its proposed unit, only stating that it had “in excess” of 75%. 
The applications for brine unit integration will likely be heard by the commission during its April 22 meeting in El Dorado. If they are approved, royalty applications are likely to follow.
State officials have been intent on establishing a lithium industry in Arkansas, promoting the potential economic benefits the investment will generate.

A section of the federal Medicaid Act says patients “may obtain” care from any provider who is willing and qualified.
It will be up to the nation’s highest court to decide what that means.
Attorneys for South Carolina and the U.S. government contend that allows states to choose which providers can be reimbursed for Medicaid-covered health care services. An attorney for Planned Parenthood argued those words give patients the right to see the provider of their choice.
The case stems from a 2018 executive order in which Gov. Henry McMaster directed the state’s Medicaid agency to remove abortion clinics from the list of providers that patients can choose to visit for non-abortion health care services.

Under federal law, Medicaid can’t pay for abortions.
But Planned Parenthood also offers “family planning” services Medicaid does cover, such as breast and cervical cancer screenings, birth control, and testing and treatment for sexually transmitted infections.
Because the Medicaid Act doesn’t explicitly use the word “right,” or similar words, such as “privilege,” “entitlement” or “immunity,” the state isn’t legally obligated to allow patients to see whatever health care provider they want, argued John Bursch, an attorney representing the state, and Kyle Hawkins, an attorney for the Office of the Solicitor General.
“We’re looking for unmistakable rights-creating language,” said Hawkins, who presented the federal government’s arguments in support of the state.
Justices Sonia Sotomayor and Kentaji Brown Jackson seemed to differ.
Requiring certain phrasing would be like telling Congress there are “magic words” that can make the court interpret the law a certain way, said the justices who are generally considered liberal.
Justice Elana Kagan was more direct in her questioning. The law’s phrasing seems to clearly convey that a patient has the right to choose their provider, she said.

“It’s impossible to even say the thing without using the word ‘right,’” Kagan said.
The use of the word “may” is not related to a person’s choice in what provider they visit but rather whether they choose to seek out health care at all, Kagan said.
“The ‘may’ is just, ‘You may see a doctor,’” Kagan said. “We’re not forcing people to see doctors.”
If the court interpreted the law as allowing states to deny Medicaid reimbursements to any doctor or practice state politicians deem unqualified, that could lead to any number of arbitrary decisions about who to include or exclude from the provider list, she said.
Some states might decide to approve only the providers that perform abortions, offer contraception or do gender transition treatment, while other states might decide the opposite, she said.
“Every state could split up the world by providers like that, right?” Kagan said.
Allowing states to do that, she added, would give patients “no ability to come back and say, ‘That’s wrong, I’m entitled to see my provider of choice, regardless of what they think about contraception or abortion or gender transition treatment.’”
Congress passed that part of the Medicaid Act because some states were trying to “steer their Medicaid beneficiaries to certain providers and away from others,” Jackson said.
That suggests Congress intended people to be able to choose which providers they want to see, said Nicole Saharsky, attorney for Planned Parenthood South Atlantic.
“There aren’t that many things that are more important than being able to choose your doctor, the person that you see when you’re at your most vulnerable, facing some of the most significant challenges to your life and your health,” Saharsky said. “Congress said a long time ago, ‘This is something we want to protect.’”
In response, Bursch argued that interpreting the wording as giving patients the right to choose their provider could open up a flood of lawsuits from people whose preferred doctors aren’t on the list.
SC’s Planned Parenthood Medicaid funding case before the Supreme Court 7 years after McMaster’s order

The law already creates an appeals process for patients who feel their care isn’t sufficient, Bursch said. Providers can also appeal to the courts if they feel they were unfairly excluded, he said.
He likened the process to private insurance, in which an insurance company will only cover care provided by doctors considered part of its network.
“The beneficiary doesn’t have the right to whip out a magic wand and then just hit on the head the doctor that they want, and then they must be qualified under Medicaid,” Bursch said.
But that process doesn’t allow a person to appeal until they’ve seen the provider, meaning that person couldn’t challenge the decision to remove a health care provider from the list entirely, said Justice Amy Coney Barrett.
“That’s the beneficiary taking the risk, going to the provider she wants to see and then potentially having to pay out of pocket,” Barrett said.
Outside the Supreme Court
Activists on both sides gathered outside the U.S. Supreme Court during the hearing, with competing bright pink signs that read “defund” or “fund” Planned Parenthood.
But representatives for Planned Parenthood said justices’ ruling is not about the organization’s ability to operate, but whether patients will lose access to health care.
“If we lose, it won’t shut us down,” said Molly Rivera, communications director for Planned Parenthood South Atlantic. “The real impact is going to be on the patients. It’s going to be on people who rely on Medicaid and Title X for preventative health care.”
Other activists who traveled to the nation’s capital showed their support with homemade signs.
They included Alex Brunken; her husband, John McNeil; and their son, Glen, who came from Slippery Rock, Pennsylvania, to support Planned Parenthood.
“Poor people should also get to choose who their providers are, not just wealthy people,” said Brunken, who described her work as being in “reproductive health care,” adding she wanted her son to see the work she and her co-workers do. 
This week, the Trump administration also temporarily froze nearly $30 million in Title X family-planning grants to Planned Parenthood affiliates, which the Guttmacher Institute estimates could impact more than 1 million people seeking contraception, testing for sexually transmitted infections or other reproductive health services.
The Alliance Defending Freedom, which is representing South Carolina officials in the lawsuit, argues that any money going to Planned Parenthood ultimately goes toward funding abortion.
“We know that money is fungible, so any dollar that’s going to an abortion facility like Planned Parenthood — even earmarked for other services — is going to enable more dollars that they have to then go towards things like their abortion activism or performing more abortions,” said Gabriella McIntyre, legal counsel at Alliance Defending Freedom.
“States need to be free to fund real, comprehensive, high-quality health care in their states and exclude organizations like Planned Parenthood” from their limited funding, she said.

McIntyre said South Carolina has “nearly 200 high quality, comprehensive healthcare facilities that are publicly funded” where Medicaid patients could go instead of Planned Parenthood for family planning services.
Rivera and other reproductive rights advocates in the state have argued there is a dearth of reproductive health providers who accept Medicaid and who are accepting new patients.
Rivera said Planned Parenthood, which is a nonprofit, actually loses money as a Medicaid provider because the government’s reimbursement rates are lower than the cost of the approved services they provide, such as cervical cancer screenings and birth control.
That’s why many for-profit health providers do not accept or limit the amount of Medicaid patients they see, which Planned Parenthood does not, she said.
She said she worries residents of South Carolina, where most abortions are currently banned after six weeks’ gestation, might have to start traveling out of state — not just for abortions, but for birth control and Pap smears.
“Both of our health centers, Columbia and Charleston, are also part of Title X, so we see people for Title X and Medicaid, and if you can’t do either because of the government, I don’t know where people are going to go,” Rivera said. “Especially with cancer screenings, early detection saves lives. So, if you have to travel across state lines for your Pap smear, are you going to be able to do that? People will just forgo care.”
While reproductive rights advocates outside the court rallied in favor of patients’ rights, U.S. Rep. Ralph Norman of South Carolina’s Fifth District argued states should have the right to determine their Medicaid providers.
He called it a case about choice as laid out in the 10th amendment of the U.S. Constitution as giving powers to the states.
It’s about the state’s choice “to determine where limited resources go, the choice of South Carolinians to align our Medicaid policies with our values, and the choice of our nation to uphold the principles of federalism that our founders so wisely enshrined,” Norman, a Rock Hill Republican who might run for governor, said while addressing national anti-abortion leaders. “I urge the court behind us to affirm our right to make these decisions free from outside interference, and I will continue to fight just alongside each one of you until this right is protected.”",https://scdailygazette.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/SCOTUS_Sofia-Resnick-Planned-Parenthood-supporters.jpg,,,2025-04-02 16:05:47.057449

A Montana beef marketing bill that caused waves in the agricultural community and would have created the Montana Cattle Committee was tabled in Senate committee on Tuesday.
House Bill 119, brought by House Speaker Brandon Ler, R-Savage, would have created a program to market Montana beef, called a checkoff. The United States Department of Agriculture’s “Got Milk” campaign is perhaps the most famous example of a “checkoff” program.
The bill sought to create a “favorable environment” for cattle producers in Montana to market their product both domestically and internationally. 
Part of the debate was an additional tax on beef cattle, which opponents said would add up for producers, who didn’t want to be paying to help market their competitors’ products.
Proponents of the bill have said the program would have benefited cattle producers across the state.
There was a small amendment to the bill that would have required the governor to appoint members of the Cattle Committee.
One member of the Senate Agriculture committee, Sen. Dennis Lenz, R-Billings, said he was a supporter of the bill until the Senate hearing. He voted no both on the amendment and the bill itself.
“Ag leaders that I know (and) have worked with, were opposed to this,” Lenz said in the hearing. “I feel like this bill needs a lot of work.”
The bill passed the House 52-47 before the Senate ag committee tabled it in a 7-4 vote. Sens.

(Photo via Google Earth)While legislation allowing all Iowa nursing home residents to have cameras in their rooms has failed to advance this session, the technology is being successfully used in one Iowa care facility.
State records show that unlike many Iowa nursing homes, Des Moines’ Greater Southside Health and Rehabilitation has a policy of allowing the use of resident-installed cameras so that family members can remotely monitor their loved ones.
The son of one elderly male resident of the home took advantage of that policy and had a camera installed in his father’s room at Greater Southside. Footage captured on Jan. 17, 2025, allegedly shows a certified nurse aide entering the man’s room at about 2 a.m., as the resident slept, and then accessing a locked drawer where the resident kept his money. It was later reported that $55 was missing from the drawer. Based on the video, the worker was fired.
The nurse aide was later interviewed by state inspectors and reportedly admitted entering the resident’s room but denied taking any money. She reportedly told inspectors that she was not aware the resident’s room was monitored by a camera installed by the man’s son.
The home’s administrator, Dirk Timm, told inspectors he watched the video on the son’s phone and it was evident to him that the nurse aide had unlocked the resident’s dresser drawer with a key, picked up something and placed the item in her pocket. He told inspectors the nurse aide informed him the resident had asked her to put his wallet in the drawer — a claim the resident denied.
The facility was subsequently fined $500 for failing to protect residents from abuse in the form of financial exploitation.
Timm told the Iowa Capital Dispatch the facility allows resident-installed cameras as long as they don’t intrude on the privacy of other residents and don’t capture bedside care in a manner that could violate a resident’s right to dignity. If a resident who wants an in-room camera has a roommate, the roommate and the facility must each agree to the use of such a device.
So far, Timm said, the policy of allowing cameras hasn’t caused any problems.
“There has been some suspicion of the cameras among some people, but I think that may be just paranoia,” he said. “But we do have information posted, as far as our policies go, and so if anyone does have an issue with the policy we just try to contact the resident’s family and let them know.”
After nine years, legislation remains stalled 
A week after the incident at Greater Southside, legislation that would prohibit Iowa care facilities from barring the use of resident-installed cameras was introduced in the Iowa House and referred to a committee. Although it is backed by the state’s Office of Long-Term Care Ombudsman, it has failed to advance.
Similar legislation was introduced in the Iowa Senate last month, but it, too, has failed to advance.
Since 2017, similar legislation has repeatedly run into stiff opposition from the Iowa Health Care Association, the organization that lobbies the Iowa Legislature on behalf of many of the state’s nursing homes.
During the 2023 legislative session, IHCA lobbyist Merea Bentrott told Iowa’s nursing home owners she was “locked, loaded and ready to go” in opposing that year’s cameras-in-nursing-homes bill.
“This is something we’ve opposed for many, many years,” Bentrott told IHCA members on a call the association recorded and later uploaded to its website. She said she was able to persuade a committee chairman to spike the bill and prevent it from moving forward.
“I’m happy to say that yesterday we were able to kill that legislation,” Bentrott said in the call. “That is good news. That was on the House side of things. The bill never had legs in the Senate. We talked to them very early on and we were able to get them to a point where they agreed that camera legislation was not something that they would make an issue this year. So, we were confident we would be able to kill the bill in the Senate, but we didn’t even want it to get to a subcommittee in the House and we were successful in preventing that from happening. So that is a big win.”
During a subsequent call, Bentrott warned the IHCA members that the camera legislation was likely to come up again in the future. “This is something that will probably come up every single year,” she said. “Best case scenario is that we kill it before it even gets any legs.”
This year, the Iowa Health Care Association is not officially registered as lobbying lawmakers on either the House or Senate version of the camera-in-nursing-homes bill.
However, IHCA was never registered as opposing the 2023 bill, either — despite Bentrott’s admission that she had actively and successfully lobbied lawmakers in an effort to “kill” the legislation.",https://iowacapitaldispatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Greater.jpg,,,2025-04-02 16:05:47.057449

(Getty Images)A bill to authorize body cameras for law enforcement officers across state agencies has advanced in the state Senate.
Senate Bill 520, sponsored by state Sen. Lisa Baker (R-Luzerne), would authorize deputy law enforcement officers with the Pennsylvania Game Commission, Fish & Boat Commission, and Department of Conservation and Natural Resources Rangers and State Park Officers to wear body cameras. The measure was approved by a 13-1 vote in the chamber’s Judiciary Committee.
Baker described body worn cameras as an “invaluable tool for modern law enforcement” in the co-sponsorship memo of the legislation, adding “they provide an accurate and unbiased account of officer engagement, protecting the integrity of citizens and officers alike.”
“In this case, the importance is amplified as law enforcement from these agencies work independently and in remote areas, oftentimes in locations that have poor radio and cellphone coverage, and frequently encounter individuals who are themselves armed,” Baker wrote. “Additionally, the nature of law enforcement within these agencies is evolving as officers are increasingly confronting serious drug activity and other criminal cases outside of the scope of sporting safety, wildlife protection, and outdoor recreation.”
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
Baker notes if passed, the bill would not impose a mandate, but instead allow each agency to decide on a “timeline of its choosing.”
Act 202, passed over a decade ago, granted authority for trained officers of PFBC and PGC to wear body cameras. It resulted in Waterways Conservative Officers of the Fish & Boat Commission and certain Officers and State Game Wardens to receive training and wear these devices, according to the co-sponsorship memo. But, deputies of the agencies were purposefully excluded under Act 202 and the prohibition remains in statute. 
During the previous session, the Senate Game & Fisheries Committee unanimously approved the proposal in October, but it did not pass the full chamber.",https://penncapital-star.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/body-camera-1024x678.jpeg,,,2025-04-02 16:05:47.057449

(Pat Sutphin for the Idaho Capital Sun)The Idaho Legislature this week approved an additional portion of Idaho Medicaid’s budget, sending the bill to Gov. Brad Little for final consideration.
Senate Bill 1201 would allocate nearly $674.2 million for Idaho Medicaid. Most of the funds — about $515.1 million — will come from the federal government, with the state’s general fund contributing $70.1 million.
The budget bill would fund a mix of largely administrative programs, including some that are required by the federal government or court order, along with a complex hospital tax structure.
The Idaho House passed the bill on a 40-30 vote Wednesday, two days after the Senate passed the bill on a 22-13 vote. 
Idaho Medicaid is the state’s largest government program that offers health insurance assistance to roughly 262,000 Idahoans. 
All told, Idaho’s total Medicaid budget for next fiscal year could be almost $5.25 billion, an 11.5% growth from this fiscal year. 
Most of next year’s budget — $3.4 billion — is set to come from the federal government, which funds most regular Medicaid costs for Idaho and 90% of Medicaid expansion’s costs. The state’s general fund would contribute a little less than $1 billion to Idaho Medicaid’s total budget next year. 
The 2026 fiscal year starts in July. 
The bill also cuts $15.9 million in Medicaid expenses, anticipating that amount in savings from House Bill 345, a sweeping Medicaid policy reform bill Little signed that calls for work requirements, privatized Medicaid benefit management and more.

 House debate rehashed worry over growing Medicaid budget, and angst over ‘enhancement’ budgets

For the past two years, Idaho’s powerful budget-setting committee has used a new practice of splitting state agencies budget bills in two categories.
So-called maintenance budgets just include enough funds for essential services. New spending is included in so-called enhancement budgets, like Senate Bill 1201.
Idaho’s budget committee, the Joint Finance-Appropriations Committee, crafted the budget bill March 21.
  Rep. Rod Furniss, R-Rigby, speaks on the House floor on March 10, 2025, at the Idaho Capitol Building in Boise. (Pat Sutphin for the Idaho Capital Sun)
But “these are not new programs” they are “ongoing enhancements,” bill cosponsor Rep. Rod Furniss, R-Rigby, told House lawmakers in debate Wednesday.
“Many items on this budget … are expenses we’ve incurred. And we have an invoice for, that we need to pay,” Furniss told House lawmakers. “These are hospital stays. These are people in homes. These are infants with brain tumors. The list goes on and on — of people that we’re helping in the state of Idaho that can’t help themselves.”
The House’s debate, which lasted over half an hour, rehashed Republican Idaho lawmakers yearslong concerns over Idaho Medicaid’s growing budget. It also was another example of a newer trend this year — of state lawmakers trying to (with some success) reject state agency enhancement budgets.
Calling next year’s Medicaid total budget the largest Idaho has ever had, Rep. Faye Thompson, R-McCall, said she couldn’t vote for a budget of this size.
“This comes at a very great cost to the working man. And it comes at a very great cost to generations that follow us, and that also includes everybody in this room,” she said.

(Alissa Eckert/Centers for Disease Control and Prevention)TOPEKA — Five of the six southwest Kansas counties reporting measles cases have seen kindergarten vaccination rates drop, one showing a 24 percentage point dip over a four-year period.
Vaccination rates are one focus of many Kansas county health officers and medical experts as they work to educate against misinformation about vaccines in the hopes of staving off a growing measles outbreak. As of April 2, Kansas has 24 confirmed measles cases in Grant, Gray, Haskell, Kiowa, Morton and Stevens counties, with one case added in the last week.
For herd immunity to be achieved — the point where enough people are vaccinated that those who are unvaccinated will be protected — 95% of a population must be vaccinated against measles, according to the World Health Organization. The Kansas measles immunization rate of kindergarteners dropped from 94.47% in 2019 to 90.21% in 2023, Kansas Department of Health and Environment data shows.
Jennifer Bacani McKenney, a family physician and county health officer in Wilson County, said she saw vaccine hesitancy increase after the COVID-19 pandemic.
“COVID made it more OK for people to decline vaccines for themselves and for children,” she said.
The idea, though, that some counties are seeing kindergarten vaccination rates drop — such as Gray County, where the rate declined from 85% in 2019 to 61% in 2023 — is concerning, Bacani McKenney said.



“When we’re getting to those points when barely the majority are vaccinated, that’s when these diseases have a chance to come back,” she said. “We know vaccines work. Polio is still probably the No. 1 example. For the longest time, so was measles, and now we’re at the point where we can’t use measles as an example.
“We are very voluntarily not protecting ourselves against a very preventable illness,” Bacani McKenney said. “The people who are suffering are really not us adults. It’s going to be our children.”
Haskell County also hit a double-digit drop in vaccination rates, with 21% fewer kindergarteners being vaccinated over that same four-year period.
Vaccinations are required for school in Kansas unless there is a religious or medical exemption. KDHE and the Kansas State Department of Education track the percentage of kindergarteners who have vaccine exemptions, and those rates are increasing too — in Haskell County from 11% in 2019 to over 25% in 2023 and in Gray County jumping from about 2% to 11%.
In Barton County, where kindergarten immunization rates dropped by nearly 7 percentage points from 2019 to 2023, Karen Winkelman, a registered nurse and director of the Barton County Health Department said she is receiving numerous questions from parents about vaccine safety. She said her team made the decision to be proactive once they heard that measles cases were reappearing nationwide.
Winkelman stresses having productive, positive conversations.
“We need to take a positive approach on this and hold down that hysteria,” she said. “We know this disease. We know the vaccine. We have something available for protection.”
It isn’t like the COVID-19 pandemic, she said, where the vaccine information changed frequently. They are disseminating information carefully, using only reliable sources, such as the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, KDHE, the American Academy of Family Physicians and others.
“We are going with factual information. The more we can educate and provide the factual, the better it is,” Winkelman said. “We’re never going to be able to control on social media or in normal conversations what is being said. We just have to really focus on those organizations that are reliable and accurate.”
The Barton County Health Department is holding an immunization clinic from 10 a.m. to noon Saturday, outside of their regular business hours, to make sure staff is available to answer questions and offer vaccinations, Winkelman said.
“We’re not going to force anyone to get the vaccine,” she said. “I just want to have all of those things available to the public for them to make an educated decision. It might be a conversation with their primary care also.”
Stevens County, which was the first Kansas county to report a measles case on March 13, currently has had six measles cases. Cammie Heaton, administrator for the county’s health department, is taking the same approach as Barton County — educate and be available to answer questions.
“We’re actually, knock on wood, sitting better now than we were three weeks ago. We are hopeful that we aren’t going to have any more,” she said. “We’re still monitoring some susceptible individuals.”
Like Barton County, her staff have offered walk-in clinics for measles vaccinations or boosters. Stevens County, according to KDHE data, has seen its vaccination rate among kindergarteners drop by 14 percentage points, from 87% in 2019 to 73% in 2023.
All measles cases in Stevens County were in unvaccinated individuals, Heaton said.
Dana Hawkinson, an internal medicine and infectious disease physician, spoke about the measles outbreak at a recent University of Kansas Health System news briefing.
“I think people should be concerned, particularly if they’re in communities that have decreased vaccination rates,” he said. “Measles is probably the most infectious viral disease that we know of. It is spread through airborne means, so people will express it into the air when they cough or breathe. Measles can linger in the air in a room for two hours.”
Combatting misinformation about the disease is critical, Hawkinson said, pointing to social media algorithms that can play into the information people receive online. But there are other factors, as well.
“We know misinformation is significant but we can’t be myopic in thinking that is the only thing we need to understand,” he said. “There are other factors in play as well.”
Those include people seeking less medical care after the pandemic, states offering increased options for vaccine exemptions, significant mistrust of science and public health medicine, as well as mistrust of physicians, Hawkinson said.
“All of these things are playing a role now to increase the risk of an individual and a community against things like this which were otherwise vaccine preventable,” he said.",https://kansasreflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/21074-e1741997984627-1024x728.jpg,,,2025-04-02 16:05:47.057449

Micah Beckwith’s office have offset the taxpayer-funded purchase of a luxury car, according to a Wednesday news release.
But he has also asked cash-strapped budget writers for other boosts, and told local governments to do more with less in a move to bring property tax cuts.
The office said it’s canceled a $195 subscription to the New York Times, renegotiated a contract to save $15,000 and won’t renew almost $150,000 in other contracts. The services were for professional development, graphic design, social media and image hosting.
Beckwith said when he came into office he asked his team to look for items and services that could be cut immediately.
“I knew there would be wasteful spending left over from the previous administration. Fiscal responsibility isn’t just about numbers — it’s about ensuring … that taxpayer money is going to essential services to Hoosiers.”
“One major purchase,” however, was a new car.
The 2025 Chevy Tahoe High Country SUV cost taxpayers just under $88,000 when purchased in February, the Indianapolis Star reported shortly before Beckwith sent his release on cuts. The High Country is the SUV’s most expensive model, with more features than lower-trim versions.
The office noted that price tag is less than what it’s saved through contracts.
“Overall, the Lt. Governor’s office has already saved the state money,” Beckwith said in the release.
The previous administration’s car was in multiple collisions and had mechanical issues, according to the release, and wouldn’t have been able to “accommodate” Beckwith and his staffers for town hall trips and community leader meetings.
“We needed a car that was big enough for the guys on my team, because the previous lieutenant governor had a smaller car, because she had a bunch of women that would travel with her, and we got some big guys that go with us,” Beckwith told the Indianapolis Star. “And so I said, ‘Hey, I’ve got to have something that’s good for three or four guys.’ And so when you start looking at those models, I mean, the price gets up there when you’re talking about a new car.”
The release noted that, when the office submitted a request for a vehicle meeting its needs, it was given just two options by the Indiana Department of Administration.
Legislation moving through the Statehouse now would have added greater scrutiny to that purchase. House Bill 1518 requires that the state buy or lease only base, standard or “government” models, and bars luxury or semi-luxury vehicle brands if non-luxury alternatives use the same vehicle platform. Vehicles for Indiana State Police, the governor and short-term use are exempt.
The Indiana Department of Administration can also grant an exception if it’s “necessary” for an agency’s “intended use.”
Rep. Justin Moed, D-Indianapolis, filed the legislation after Indiana Secretary of State Diego Morales’s office used taxpayer funds to buy a $90,000 GMC Yukon Denali over the summer.
Beckwith has also raised eyebrows for big asks from budget builders trying to navigate falling revenue and rising expenses.
He requested to nearly double his office’s budget to nearly $9.5 billion for each of the next two years — mostly to support faith-based initiatives, the Indianapolis Star reported. He also asked for more spending for agencies he oversees — even as Gov. Mike Braun has called on cabinet secretaries to identify 5% in savings across agencies.

He also asked for more spending for agencies he oversees — even as Gov. Mike Braun has called on cabinet secretaries to identify 5% in savings across agencies.

(Whitney Downard/Indiana Capital Chronicle)In the nearly three years since Chandler Nelson died from a rare form of pediatric cancer, his parents haven’t forgotten the promise they made to their son to keep fighting and seeking a cure. 
“After a while, Riley (Children’s Health) said they didn’t have anything left. There was absolutely nothing. They called five different states and they all said the same thing,” said his mother, Amber Nelson. “That day, he bawled and he looked me straight in the face and he said, ‘Mommy … never stop fighting. Don’t give up.’
“‘I will never,’” Amber Nelson recalled promising at the time. “‘You know our family. We will never give up.’”
Though Chandler was 20 at the time of his death, rhabdomyosarcoma is a rare type of cancer that most often occurs in children under the age of 10, according to the Mayo Clinic. Chandler’s symptoms first appeared in February 2020 when he was already 18 and studying to be a chef.

Keeping their vow, Amber and Clint Nelson were part of a group of parents who appeared at the Statehouse on Wednesday who urged lawmakers to adopt House Bill 1453. Under the proposal, the Indiana Department of Health would oversee a pediatric cancer research and treatment grant funded by private donations. 
Though the state isn’t putting forth any funding, the Nelsons shared that having one centralized fund would better focus efforts on children like their son. Larger pools of cancer research funding tend to focus on strains that affect more people, but pediatric cancer impacts far smaller numbers. 
Experts said that while the Food and Drug Administration approved a dozen new drugs annually for adult cancer treatments, just 11 have been approved for children in the last 50 years. This means that children have to rely on adult drugs for treatment, even though they might be less effective.
“Children are receiving hand-me-down drugs,” said Lewis Stancato. “Why does this happen? Frankly, there’s no money to be made in pediatric cancer drug development.”
Stancato is a vice president with the Indiana Biosciences Research Institute, focusing specifically on developing drugs to treat rare pediatric diseases. 
He also said recent funding cuts at the National Institutes of Health could have a “drastic (and) negative effect on pediatric cancer research.”
The Senate health committee unanimously approved the measure on Wednesday, which must also get the greenlight from the Senate Appropriations Committee.
The Nelsons, part of Elevate Childhood Cancer Research and Advocacy, point to a centralized fund as a way to bring several grassroots efforts together. Those dollars can then go to researchers like Stancato or universities to coordinate their work. 
“We need a spot for pediatric cancer. It doesn’t need to be mixed (with adult research). They have to have their own,” said Amber Nelson.
“And if they need money, then they have to be able to work with other people. So (Indiana University), Purdue (University, (the University of) Notre Dame, all of them … have to be able to work together,” added Clint Nelson.
“You’ve got to start somewhere,” he concluded.

The bill only requires the first stanza of the song to be broadcast. But Democrats on the committee said that it would require students to be exposed to parts of the song, particularly the third stanza, which critics have said is an attack on Black Americans who escaped slavery by joining the British Army. 
Sen. Rodger Smitherman, D-Birmingham, pointed out that parts of the song could offend Black students and families and urged the other senators on the committee to read the third stanza.
“There’s no way that you can require students in general, and African American students in particular, to glorify [slavery],” Smitherman said. “That’s a slap in their face. That’s a slap in their parents’ face.”
Sen. Kirk Hatcher, D-Montgomery, said that “a vast majority of our colleagues” may not be aware of the historical context of the lyrics, adding that he was concerned about the erasure of Black history in trying to make this a requirement.
“Americans don’t know American history because of things like this,” Hatcher said.
Smitherman said that is why diversity measures are needed, saying that Republican lawmakers don’t consider the impact some bills have on other groups of people.
“Because it’s not going to cause none to them. Not that they dislike other people. Not that they’re intentionally trying to do something to other people. There’s no sensitivity,” he said.
Sen. Vivian Davis Figures, D-Mobile, said that she was against proposing this policy as a constitutional amendment.
“We’re talking about adding this as a constitutional amendment,” Figures said. “I’m going to have to vote no on this. I can see you doing, maybe, a statute to require it, but I can’t go along with the constitutional amendment for something like this.”
The bill can now be considered by the Senate. It will need the approval of three-fifths of legislators in the chamber to advance.

""When Democrats shine a light on the fact that Republicans are taking vital programs away from the middle class simply to cut taxes for the ultrarich, the public doesn't like it. When we shine a light on Republican attacks on Medicaid, on Social Security, on veterans’ health care, simply to cut taxes for the rich, Americans listen and they're aghast of what they see.""That is one of the main reasons that the results in Wisconsin came in as resoundingly as they did.""Schumer didn’t mention Republicans winning two U.S. House special elections in Florida.Ticket splitting in WisconsinWisconsin voters have a history of ticket splitting, including during November’s presidential election, when the state favored Trump, but also voted to send Democratic Sen. Tammy Baldwin back to Washington.Trump won the state by less than 30,000 votes out of more than 3.3 million cast. Baldwin secured another six-year term by roughly the same margin.Crawford received 55% of the vote in this election, winning by about 238,000 votes out of nearly 2.4 million votes cast, according to data from The Associated Press.GOP Sen. Rick Scott of Florida told reporters Tuesday evening shortly after the results came in that he’s not reading too much into the narrower margin of victory for the two newly elected Republicans in his home state and he doesn't believe it tells lawmakers anything about what might happen in the 2026 midterm elections.“Remember, they’re special elections. It's hard, you know … when there's a presidential race, everybody knows to vote, even a governor's race,” Scott said inside the U.S. Capitol. “But when there's a special election, it's hard for people to go out and vote.”Former Florida Chief Financial Officer Jimmy Patronis defeated the Democratic candidate in the state’s 1st Congressional District after receiving 56.9% of the vote, according to the Board of Elections’ unofficial results. The GOP lawmaker who won that district in November did so with 66% of the vote.In the 6th Congressional District, former state Sen. Randy Fine secured election with 56.6% of the vote, a smaller margin of victory than the 66.5% the former Republican congressman who occupied the seat received in November.Trump focuses on FloridaTrump hailed the GOP wins in Florida in a social media post, but didn’t mention Wisconsin, where special government employee and close political ally Musk campaigned late last month.“BOTH FLORIDA HOUSE SEATS HAVE BEEN WON, BIG, BY THE REPUBLICAN CANDIDATE,” Trump wrote. “THE TRUMP ENDORSEMENT, AS ALWAYS, PROVED FAR GREATER THAN THE DEMOCRATS FORCES OF EVIL. CONGRATULATIONS TO AMERICA!!!”DNC Chair Ken Martin wrote in a statement the Wisconsin Supreme Court election results show voters in the state “squarely rejected the influence of Elon Musk, Donald Trump, and billionaire special interests.”“Democrats are overperforming, winning races, and building momentum,” Martin wrote. “We’re working hard to continue the trend in the Virginia, Pennsylvania, and New Jersey elections this year and then — with the people on our side — to take back the House in 2026.”Martin, similar to Schumer, didn’t mention the Florida congressional district races won by GOP politicians.National Republican Congressional Committee spokesman Mike Marinella released a statement pointing to Florida as solid evidence the party is on the right track.""Florida’s resounding Republican victories send a clear message: Americans are fired up to elect leaders who will fight for President Trump’s agenda and reject the Democrats’ failed policies,” Marinella wrote. “While Democrats set their cash ablaze, House Republicans will keep hammering them for being out of touch — and we’ll crush them again in 2026.""Jeffries targets 60 districtsU.S. House Democrats’ campaign arm, the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee, didn’t release any statements on the Florida election results. But House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries, D-N.Y., said during a press conference Wednesday that the Democratic candidates in the Sunshine State “dramatically overperformed” how Trump did in those areas in November.“There are 60 House Republicans who hold districts right now that Donald Trump won by 15 points or less in November. Every single one of those Republicans should be concerned,” Jeffries said. “The American people have rejected their extreme brand and their do-nothing agenda and they’re going to be held accountable next November.”",,,,2025-04-02 15:08:21.674055

(Photo By Charlotte Rene Woods / Virginia Mercury)About 2,000 people gathered outside of the Capitol on Wednesday for the 7th annual Virginia March For Life, one of the largest anti-abortion demonstrations in the state. Lt. Gov. Winsome Earle-Sears was a keynote speaker, where she energized the crowd near the beginning of the event before they paced around the state Capitol in downtown Richmond carrying signs, banners and bullhorns. 
“We stand for life and how can it ever be wrong to stand for life?” Earle-Sears asked.
Abortion opponents and abortion rights groups have painted each other as “extreme” or “radical,” framing both Earle-Sears and Family Foundation president Victoria Cobb criticized. 
“Are we really ‘radical’ for showing up here today to march on behalf of voiceless Virginians?” Cobb posited. 
Cobb also referenced an ongoing process to enshrine abortion protections into Virginia’s constitution. The measure, which passed the legislature this year (and is not subject to gubernatorial approval) must pass again next year before appearing on statewide ballots for voters to approve or reject. 
She added that the constitutional amendment was “barbaric” and reiterated that Republicans had offered an amendment to the amendment that outlines procedures for instances when an infant is born as the result of a “botched abortion.” 
Democrats, who control both the House and Senate chambers, rejected the proposal, since infanticide is already prohibited by state code and federal law. In Virginia state code, “partial birth infanticide” means “any deliberate act that is intended to kill a human infant who has been born alive but has not been completely extracted or expelled from its mother.” It also “shall not under any circumstances be construed to include” abortion procedures. 
Republicans had also offered an amendment to include parental consent requirements for minors, which Democrats also rejected since it is also already law. While Democrats have stressed that current law nor the amendment would allow abortion up to the “moment of birth,” many Republicans and President Donald Trump have made such claims. As Democrats have coalesced around the amendment, Republicans have embraced a variety of limits or near-total bans in recent years.
After some religious leaders led the crowd in prayer and gave speeches at Wednesday’s march, Northern Virginia resident Shawnte Mallory shared her journey as a political advocate and mother of six.

When she became pregnant with her third child, her then-boyfriend abandoned her and she became homeless. She was able to stay at a shelter, kept that pregnancy and has gone on to have other children. 
“There is hope and there are resources,” she said. 
Likewise, Del. Delores Oates, R-Warren, shared her own experience with an unexpected pregnancy. Oates shared the same personal anecdote during this year’s legislative session — each time relaying how proud she is of her now-adult son and how grateful she was for the support system of her mother and grandmother.

“I don’t want any woman who’s within hearing this message to miss out on incredible blessings that a child is in your life,” Oates said. 
While Mallory and Oates were able to lean on others around them and get support to keep their pregnancies, abortion rights advocates say not all pregnant people experience those opportunities. Those who favor abortion also point out that the procedure can be sought for various reasons or be medically necessary. Voters nationwide have backed abortion rights in Republican- and Democrat-leaning states, while a 2024 Pew Research poll found 63% of Americans support abortion in all or most cases. 
“While a vocal minority rallies today at the Virginia March For Life, most Virginians support the right to make personal health care decisions without political interference,” Planned Parenthood Advocates of Virginia director Jamie Lockhart told The Mercury Wednesday. 
Although abortion isn’t a wholly partisan issue, Virginia’s own constitutional amendment has so far advanced on party lines, setting the matter up as a key issue in this year’s elections for Virginia’s House of Delegates. 
“Our chance to stop the truly radical, unsafe, unlimited abortion amendment is to install a pro-life majority in the Virginia House of Delegates this year,” Cobb said. 
With all 100 seats in the chamber up for election this year, Virginia’s governor, lieutenant governor and attorney general seats will also be on the ballot. Earle-Sears will face former delegate Dave LaRock and former senator Amanda Chase in a Republican primary for the governorship this summer before one of them goes against Democrat Abigail Spanberger in the fall. Reproductive health is expected to feature prominently in some of this year’s elections. 
While not formally speakers at the Virginia March For Life, both LaRock and Chase were there and mingled with attendees. When they were members of the state legislature, both previously carried anti-abortion bills. 
Democratic Party of Virginia spokesperson Maggie Amjad said Earle-Sears’ track record on reproductive health had earned her the March For Life keynote speech slot by “supporting a dangerous agenda that would strip Virginia women of their right to make decisions about their own bodies.”

DPVA has routinely lambasted Earle-Sears in recent months since she cast a tie-breaking vote in an attempt to shut down a right-to-contraception bill earlier this year. Democrats in the Senate had politically postured to force her vote on the matter before utilizing chamber rules to redo their vote and advance the bill.
Youngkin signs bill to protect reproductive and sexual health data, amends right to contraception

The bill’s patrons say it’s especially important, amid the potential overturning of U.S. Supreme Court cases that protect contraception access and the shifting national landscape around reproductive health at large. Following the overturn of cases that had protected abortion access, most notably the 2022 strike down of Roe v. Wade, Justice Clarence Thomas expressed interest in revisiting contraception cases. The bill, by Sen. Ghazala Hashmi, D-Chesterfield and Del. Cia Price, D-Newport News, would offer state-level protection should federal ones fall. 
As states around the nation have explored restrictions on contraception, abortion and in vitro fertilization, Virginia’s pending constitutional amendment would address all three issues if voters are able to approve it next year.

The version of the Republican-backed amendment approved by a House committee Monday, if passed out of the legislature and approved by voters, would outlaw abortion with limited exceptions [&#8230;]","Susan Klein, executive director of Missouri Right to Life, hosts a rally in the Missouri State Capitol rotunda last week (Annelise Hanshaw/Missouri Independent).The newest reworking of a proposed constitutional amendment seeking to undermine abortion rights in Missouri has managed to draw the ire of the state’s largest anti-abortion group.
The version of the Republican-backed amendment approved by a House committee Monday, if passed out of the legislature and approved by voters, would outlaw abortion with limited exceptions for medical emergencies and survivors of rape and incest prior to 12 weeks gestation.
The latest version, approved by a different House committee Tuesday, proposed adding a new section to the constitution seeking to put stricter parameters on the abortion-right amendment — also known as Amendment 3 — approved by voters in November. 
The bill’s sponsor, Republican state Rep. Melanie Stinnett of Springfield, said Monday’s version wasn’t one she “necessarily approved.” Stinnett said the latest version is again her own, based on feedback she received earlier in the session. 
“It’s really just addressing the things that I really feel like are in line with the people’s expectations of what they were voting on in Amendment 3,” she said. 
Susan Klein with Missouri Right to Life in testifying against the legislation said while Monday’s version sought to “repeal and replace” Amendment 3, the new version fails to do so.
Missouri Right to Life in a statement Wednesday called the revised amendment an “extreme gamble,” raising doubts about whether it would actually limit the number of abortions provided under the law.
Stinnett’s latest legislation would ask voters if they want to add language into the constitution that does the following: 

Require any minors seeking reproductive health care first obtain parental consent.
Define “reproductive health care” as anything related to women’s “potential or actual pregnancy,” including prenatal care, contraception, miscarriage, childbirth and abortion.
Clarify that women have the right to file medical malpractice challenges. 
Specify that no private or public funding can be required to go toward reproductive health care.
Require that any legal challenges to the state law around reproductive health care be heard in Cole County. 
Establish there is “compelling government interest” in reproductive health care.

The issue of “compelling government interest” in reproductive health care has been raised on several occasions as a court case challenging the state’s abortion regulations continues to play out in Jackson County. 
Amendment 3 states that “the right to reproductive freedom shall not be denied, interfered with, delayed, or otherwise restricted unless the government demonstrates that such action is justified by a compelling governmental interest achieved by the least restrictive means.”
Referencing the language in Amendment 3, Jackson County Judge Jerri Zhang blocked a number of abortion regulations, including a 72-hour waiting period for an abortion and a mandate that physicians performing abortions have admitting privileges at nearby hospitals, citing a failure by the state to demonstrate compelling governmental interest.
Stinnett, when asked about this language Tuesday, said it was necessary.
“Our government in many ways has an interest in health, safety and welfare,” she said.
Missouri Right to Life also said the proposed amendment failed to challenge the abortion-right’s amendment’s non-discrimination clause. 
“The judge in Jackson County used this provision to invalidate all of Missouri’s health and safety regulations,” according to the group’s statement Wednesday. “And she, or another court, will do it again with Amendment 3 still in the Missouri Constitution.”
Missouri health department rejects Planned Parenthood plan to start medication abortions

House Minority Leader Ashley Aune, a Democrat from Kansas City, asked if a married 16-year-old would need to seek her parents’ permission to obtain birth control under this amendment. 
“The sad reality is that too many young people don’t have that support,” she said, voicing concerns that the amendment is focused broadly on reproductive health care, including contraceptive access for minors.  “I think we open it up to a lot of young folks falling through the cracks, especially the most victimized and marginalized.” 
She also highlighted the language around federal funding, pointing out that the federal government just this week froze Title X family planning funds earmarked for a number of states, including Missouri. Providers say this could cause thousands of low-income Missourians to lose access to care for family planning services, including contraceptives.
While Stinnett indicated she didn’t approve of Monday’s version of the bill, she did continue to include its requirement that any legal challenges to the state law around reproductive health care be heard in Cole County. 
The Missouri Attorney General’s Office has been fighting unsuccessfully to move the Jackson County lawsuit to Cole County where last year, a judge attempted to remove the abortion-rights amendment from the ballot.
Stinnett said at Tuesday’s hearing that the Cole County language was included to address concerns around judicial load so that such cases could be brought forward quickly. 
Just this week, another lawsuit by Planned Parenthood against the state was filed somewhere other than Cole County. 
The new lawsuit filed Tuesday in the St. Louis Circuit Court challenges Missouri Attorney General Andrew Bailey, saying he “unlawfully blocked access to medication abortion” by issuing a cease-and-desist order to Planned Parenthood when the clinics were not prescribing the medication. 
“The order violates due process by lacking any factual basis and failing to meet Missouri’s legal standards for government actions,” Planned Parenthood Great Rivers said in a statement Monday. 
Stinnett’s legislation is scheduled to go before the House rules committee Thursday morning. If approved there, it will go to the full House for debate. She said she anticipates more amendments will be offered on the House floor.

(Getty Images)Opposition to a bill targeting “human sexuality” instruction continued Wednesday at the Indiana Statehouse, where critics argued that parents already have access to — and authority over — such coursework for their kids.
On the table before the House Education Committee, too, was legislation to further address widespread chronic absenteeism among Hoosier students.
Up first was Senate Bill 442, which requires any instruction and learning materials used to teach “human sexuality” for grades 4-12 be approved by a school board. 
Basic information about the curriculum would have to be published in a “conspicuous” place on the school’s website. That includes a list of classes, by grade level, “in which any instruction concerning human sexuality will be taught,’ and whether that  instruction “will be provided by a male or female instructor.”
The school’s parental consent form — which lets parents remove their children from sexual education classes — would also need a link to that information. A grievance procedure would additionally need to be in place for parents to call out non-compliant schools.

Critics of the bill emphasized, however, that Indiana parents already have the right to remove their child from sex education classes.
Currently, school boards also have the authority to review and approve curricular materials. State law further requires school corporations to make instructional materials available to parents so that they can consent to instruction on human sexuality.
“A parent can contact the teacher and say, ‘What’s the curriculum?’ And the teacher has to tell them … and then (parents) can already opt their child out of whatever education that they don’t feel is appropriate,” said Rep. Tonya Pfaff, D-Terre Haute. “I’m wondering why we’re doing this when it already exists.”
But bill author Sen. Gary Byrne, R-Byrneville, questioned if school boards “are actually having conversations” about related curriculum. He reiterated Wednesday that his proposal “respects both local control and parental rights” and “just says materials used in sex ed must be approved by the local school board.” 
Byrne said the bill stems from concerns brought to him by teachers and parents and intends to “help parents better decide whether they want to opt their child out” of sex ed courses.
He gave a similar argument before the Senate education committee earlier in the session. His bill advanced from that panel — and from the full chamber — along party lines.
“We all know conversations on sex ed are more sensitive than other subjects because families have different values, different ideals, about what is appropriate to talk about and when it’s appropriate to talk to their child, or when it’s appropriate for their child to hear about it,” Byrne said.
“We don’t have any state standards for sex ed, so teachers don’t have a lot of direction,” he continued. “I didn’t want to force anything at the state level. But as a former school board member, I think putting local school boards in the driver’s seat on this issue makes good sense. They are elected by the voters, after all, so I think this is a good bill.”
More opposition against sex ed measure
The introduction of sex education usually starts in the fourth grade, according to state guidelines. But Indiana does not require the course in schools. Instead, it only mandates that schools teach lessons on HIV and AIDS. Schools that do teach sex education are expected to focus on abstinence.
Byrne introduced a similar bill in 2024 that advanced from the Senate but died in the House without a committee hearing.










I'm wondering why we're doing this when it already exists.


– Rep. Tonya Pfaff, D-Terre Haute


This year’s bill has some tweaks: non-public schools are excluded; and a new provision, added in the Senate education committee, updates reference to “sexually transmitted diseases” in the existing sex education statute with “sexually transmitted infections.”
The House Education Committee heard testimony on Byrne’s proposal but is not expected to take a vote until next week — just before the deadline for bills to advance from committee.
Two amendments to the bill are pending.
One offered by Rep. Julie McGuire, R-Indianapolis, seeks to require sex ed instruction to include a presentation on “human growth and development during pregnancy” that includes:

a “high-definition ultrasound video,” at least three minutes long, “showing the development of the brain, heart, sex organs and other vital organs in early fetal development;” and
a “high-quality computer-generated rendering or animation” showing “the process of fertilization and each stage of fetal development inside the uterus, noting significant markers in cell growth and organ development for every week of pregnancy from fertilization to birth.”

Democratic Rep. Ed DeLaney, also of Indianapolis, questioned whether lawmakers are confusing what this new term ‘human sexuality’ is.
“I think I’m in support of this particular amendment, but I’m worried about where we’re going here,” he said. “Are we opening the door here to a broad discussion of, ‘Let’s call it everything about sex except the sex act?’ That’s what’s troubling me here. … Where’s the line here as to what we can’t talk about, what we can talk about?”
DeLaney offered his own amendment to the bill to better specify what would be required of school boards and “get rid of telling the parents whether the teacher who’s going to teach the class is male or female — I find that personally offensive.”

Byrne held that parents should know information about the teacher so they can decide if their child should participate in the instruction.
“A young child or young boy … they may behave differently depending on whether it’s a male or female teacher,” he said. “And if you think about a daughter, do I want a man teaching those subjects to her?”
Democrats — along with Rep. Becky Cash, R-Zionsville — separately asked what would happen if materials, or even the class’ teacher, changed during the academic year, since the postings are due in July. Byrne replied that “locals can figure that out … they’ll be able to navigate that.”
Roughly 30 minutes of public testimony, mostly from school and teachers groups, was critical of the bill. Samantha Bresnahan, a senior policy specialist for the American Civil Liberties Union of Indiana, cautioned, for example, whether the bill would apply to a wide range of subjects beyond sex education, including literature and science classes. 
“This could create confusion about which courses need to be approved and reported on, and have a chilling effect for education on a wide range of subjects,” she told the committee.
Only Micah Clark, representing the American Family Association of Indiana, spoke in favor, saying the bill “informs parents of what will be taught on a potentially sensitive subject, and ensures that elected school board members have reviewed whatever might be taught on this topic.”
Continued support for chronic absenteeism interventions
House lawmakers additionally considered Republican Sen. Stacey Donato’s measure to beef up the state’s absenteeism statute.
Senate Bill 482 has multiple parts, including a new definition in state code for chronically absent, specified in the bill as missing 10% or more of the school year, regardless of whether it is excused.
Another provision allows local prosecuting attorneys to hold “intervention meetings” with parents to help improve a student’s attendance before any legal action is taken. 
Indiana officials say chronic absenteeism rates are improving, but there’s still more work ahead

A final section of the bill would prohibit K-8 students from expulsion “solely because that student is chronically absent or habitually truant,” said Donato, of Logansport. Current law permits students in those grades to be expelled for missing too much school.
The Senate measure mirrors House Bill 1201, which unanimously passed the House but has yet to get a Senate hearing. A House committee vote on Donato’s bill is likely to come next week.
Multiple school advocates who testified Wednesday supported Donato’s effort.
“This bill acknowledges that a one size fits all approach simply won’t work,” said Cindy Long, assistant executive director for the Indiana Association of School Principals. “It gives schools the tools they need to support students, engage families and take additional action when necessary, without penalizing our youngest learners for struggles beyond their control.”
Chris Lagoni, of the Indiana Small and Rural Schools Association, said his organization also backs the proposal, but recommended other language be added to the bill to address students who use school transfers “as a way to escape accountability.” 
“We’d like to really work on focusing and getting kids to school,” Lagoni said. “If they can make it to school, they can make it to work. … And (we want to) continue to look at, and make sure, that students aren’t using the opportunity to transfer to another school to escape the process of trying to improve their attendance.”

The law, named the Alabama Public Employee Paid Parental Leave Act of 2025, will go into effect on July 1.
The legislation passed the House 94-2 on March 20. The two votes against it were male representatives that claimed parents could use their accrued sick leave or “catastrophic” sick leave for parental leave. According to the Alabama State Department of Education, teachers earn one sick day per month for 10 months. 
Rep. Ginny Shaver, R-Leesburg, a longtime supporter of paid parental leave who carried Figures’ bill in the House, said during debate on the House floor last month that it takes more than 10 days to recover from having a baby.
“Having a baby is a normal function. The catastrophic leave is for that, catastrophic and for unusual circumstances,” Shaver said in March.
The legislation does not make parental leave an accruable benefit. According to the Legislative Services Agency, the leave will cost $10,750 for parents that take eight weeks and $2,600 for those that take two weeks. 
Figures sponsored a bill last year for educators that was changed to remove male employees’ leave and leave in the case of a miscarriage and stillborn. The Senate passed the bill, but then-Senate President Pro Tem Greg Reed, R-Jasper, prevented it from being sent to the House, something any senator can do after the 26th legislative day. 
“Paid leave is an essential tool for workforce and economic growth, providing education and state employees with the opportunity to care for their newborn or newly adopted child without worrying about unnecessary financial strain,” Figures said in a statement.
According to the statement, providing paid parental leave to public employees was a recommendation included in the Final Report of the Governor’s Study Group on Efficiency in State Government as a way to increase the recruitment and retention of public employees.
“This is a proud day for Alabama families, and I want to thank Sen. Vivian Figures and Rep. Ginny Shaver for championing this effort from the very start,” Ivey said.
Shaver sponsored the House version of the bill. She echoed Ivey that the bill supports Alabama’s values.
“By providing paid parental leave for state employees and education employees, we are not only recognizing the fundamental importance of family, but also investing in the well-being and stability of our workforce,” Shaver said in a statement.

(Photo courtesy NM Forestry)National fire weather forecasters warn that most of New Mexico will face above-normal fire potential this month, and those conditions will worsen until at least until the monsoon season begins in July.
The National Interagency Fire Center issued its April wildfire outlook Tuesday, presenting a series of maps showing New Mexico with snow pack far below normal, along with severe drought and above normal average temperatures expected throughout the summer. 
Those factors combine to make the state, particularly the western two-thirds, at high risk of wildfires beginning in May, according to forecasters. 
‘It’s bad’: How drought, lack of snowpack and federal cuts could spell wildfire disaster in NM

So far in New Mexico this year, 222 wildfires have started, affecting 31,675 acres. Humans caused the vast majority of those fires, according to the Southwest Coordination Center. The Mogote Hill Fire near Wagon Mound, which burned an estimated 15,000 acres, ranks as the biggest New Mexico fire so far this year. 
Last week, New Mexico State Forestry released daily wildfire awareness tips, including how and when to safely burn debris. 
The above-normal wildfire potential occurs amid federal cuts to the United States Forest Service, including probationary employees who often had wildfire suppression training. 
Proposed federal lease terminations also include two New Mexico wildfire dispatch centers covering one-third of the state, though U.S. Sen. Martin Heinrich’s office recently told Source New Mexico that he had received “assurances” that the dispatch centers would stay open. 
A Heinrich spokesperson noted, however, that his office was still awaiting  official confirmation about the dispatch centers from the General Services Administration. The Heinrich spokesperson did not respond to a request for comment Tuesday as to whether that official confirmation had yet arrived.",https://sourcenm.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/crews-work-to-secure-line-on-mogote-hill-fire_nm-forestry-division--e1742232848376.webp,,,2025-04-02 14:07:38.307298

Other components of the Lightning Plan, however, fall short in protecting public health.","Aerial shot of power plant and industrial buildings on the bank of the Allegheny River in Springdale, a town 18 miles north of Pittsburgh in Allegheny County. (Courtesy of Getty Images)On January 30, Gov. Josh Shapiro announced his “Lightning Plan,” a comprehensive proposal meant to address Pennsylvania’s energy future and promote a wide array of energy projects in the Commonwealth. Elements of the plan were reflected in Shapiro’s proposed 2025-2026 budget, released in February, and are discussed in EHP’s new white paper: “Pennsylvania’s Shale Gas Boom: What the Shapiro Administration Can Do to Better Protect Public Health.”
The “Lightning Plan” proposes an “all of the above” approach to securing Pennsylvania’s energy future, parts of which may benefit the health of Pennsylvanians. Climate emissions reductions, faster approval and tax credits for renewable energy projects, and standards that incentivize the next generation of energy will all help to improve public health.
  Gov. Josh Shapiro speaks about his energy plan Wednesday, March 13, 2024, in Scranton (Commonwealth Media Services photo)
The plan also calls for rebates and incentives for consumers to buy new energy efficient appliances and other goods that reduce energy use. Energy efficiency is always a good approach – the cheapest, cleanest, and healthiest kilowatt-hour is the one not used. We applaud any steps that will support a just transition to a renewable energy economy and support jobs for the Commonwealth.
Other components of the Lightning Plan, however, fall short in protecting public health. As in the past, the Shapiro Administration continues to define “clean energy” broadly to include fossil fuels, such as shale gas. Shale gas is used as feedstock in certain hydrogen, petrochemical, and aviation fuel plants operating or proposed in Western Pennsylvania and other areas of the state. The incentives in Shapiro’s plan give these industrial complexes the ability to add to Pennsylvania’s existing pollution problems.
When it comes to energy, there must be a reckoning with how we define “clean.” Because of what we know about pervasive infrastructure leaks and climate risks associated with unburned methane, any claim that fracked gas is a realistic climate solution is patently false. Pollution from shale gas operations hastens climate change, producing more devastating storms, floods, heatwaves, fires, and insect-borne diseases – putting public health at risk for all Pennsylvanians and, indeed, for people across the globe.
Meanwhile, families who live in proximity to the vast network of gas wells, processing plants, compressor stations, pipelines, storage facilities, petrochemical operations, and other infrastructure continue to be exposed to pollution that raises the risk of health harms. Research shows associations between shale gas development and an array of health impacts, including poor birth outcomes, asthma exacerbation, heart failure and high blood pressure, stress and mental health issues, and cancer. 
At least one study also suggests that continued shale gas development has weakened, rather than strengthened, the local economy and contributed to reductions in population and jobs. Furthermore, there has historically been little to no meaningful government engagement with communities when making decisions about the infrastructure they will host, even though their residents will bear the brunt of those decisions in the form of adverse health impacts.
Ultimately there needs to be consideration for public health ramifications with any of these proposed energy actions. A major part of that consideration must be meaningful engagement with the communities hosting energy infrastructure to ensure equity in decision-making processes and to prioritize public health in places where it is most at risk.
For years, frontline residents have had little to no say in the construction of shale gas facilities in their communities – including where, how, or if it happens. In response to their concerns, they have received, at best, iterations of greenwashed lip service, most recently with CNX’s “Radical Transparency” initiative.
The Shapiro Administration must also take the lead in promoting a just transition to renewable energy. With its strong roots in manufacturing, its expertise in technology and medical research, and an existing workforce that is energy-oriented, Pennsylvania has what it takes to become a renewable energy leader, creating sustainable jobs, reducing health impacts and health care costs, and saving lives.
 Gov. Shapiro has an opportunity to show courageous leadership in a way none of his predecessors have since the beginning of the shale gas boom: by meaningfully engaging with nearby communities any time energy infrastructure is proposed and by making sure that “clean” means “safe” for the vast majority of Pennsylvanians.

(Photo by Robin Opsahl/Iowa Capital Dispatch)Iowa Gov. Kim Reynolds signed into law Wednesday a measure banning drivers from using cellphones behind the wheel outside of hands-free or voice-activated modes.
Reynolds was joined by more than 50 people in her office Wednesday, many of whom were related to people who had died because of distracted driving. The governor recognized the names of many of the people who lost their lives due to distracted driving incidents before signing the measure into law.
“I want to extend my heartfelt gratitude to their families for being here today and for their tireless advocacy,” Reynolds said. “I can’t imagine how hard it’s been to tell and to retell your stories, but your courage will save lives. So, on behalf of all the families across our great state, thank you.”
With the bill’s signing, the measure, which is an expansion from Iowa’s current law banning texting while driving, will go into effect July 1. Law enforcement officers will give warnings for violations from July through the rest of 2025. Beginning Jan. 1, 2026, using handheld personal electronic devices while driving will result in a fine of $100. If the incident results in an injury, the fine is raised to $500, and incidents that cause death will raise the fine to $1,000.
The governor said that Iowa has become the 31st state in the country to have a “hands free” law on the books, and that neighboring states like Minnesota and Illinois have seen major decreases in car crashes since enacting similar laws.
“I’m grateful, because this legislation will save lives,” Reynolds said. “According to a recent study, a 10% reduction in distracted driving in Iowa will prevent over 1,200 crashes, 700 injuries and six deaths, as well as over $50 million in economic damages.”
The measure had received support from Reynolds at the beginning of the session, when she mentioned the proposal in her January Condition of the State address. Part of the governor’s push came in part after meeting the family of Roland Taylor of Terril — a victim of a distracted driving crash in 2023. The governor said she signed the measure into law, nearly two years to the day of the crash “in his memory, and we’d do the same for every Iowan killed due to distracted driving.”
Angie Smith, the daughter of Taylor, said she and her family met Reynolds at the Clay County Fair in 2024 and talked to her about her father’s death.
“My mom stated to the governor, ‘We need to do something about a handsfree bill,’ and it caught her attention, and it was very emotional for the governor also,” Smith said. “So (she) reached out to us and has been pushing and supporting ever since.”
Smith said “there’s not a better way that we could have honored dad today,” saying Taylor would have been proud to see the law being signed and save lives.
“When the governor called me personally last week and said … that it was passed, I just broke down in tears,” Smith said. “And I called mom immediately, so happy to just know that this is going to save someone else’s life, hopefully that these families will not have to go through this.”
Senate File 22 was an effort that advocates have pushed lawmakers to pass for almost seven years. While in previous sessions the measure failed in the Iowa House, the chamber passed the 2025 bill in a 84-11 vote in late March.
Peter Bengtson, the father of Ellen Bengtson, who was killed by a distracted driver while biking in 2020, said that the years of the bill failing to advance felt like a “kick to the gut,” but that the law being signed Wednesday was a “good first step” toward preventing distracted driving deaths. He said the law will allow law enforcement officers to start educating and informing people about the dangers of using phones while driving, and is an important start in stopping preventable deaths on Iowa roads.
“This is an experience you don’t want to have,” Bengtson said. “You don’t want to be on the side of the situation where you lose a loved one, and I can’t imagine you want to be the person behind the wheel who knew that you made a bad choice and you killed other people or maimed them. …This is an epidemic beyond compare for public safety. We need to do something about it, and this legislation gets us closer.”",https://iowacapitaldispatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/reynolds.handsfree.4.2.3-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-04-02 14:07:38.307298

FAU’s trustees in February picked a new president: Adam Hasner, a former GOP state lawmaker and executive of a for-profit prison group that manages 16 ICE detention centers across the country.
Hasner served in the Florida House of Representatives from 2002 to 2010, taking the role of House majority leader during his last three years in the chamber. Between 2016 and his appointment at FAU, he was executive vice president for public policy at the GEO Group, where he oversaw 60 consultants representing the company’s interests in D.C., according to his resume.
The $4 billion company’s stock value doubled after Election Day, according to ProPublica.
Following a two-year-long presidential search, FAU’s trustees picked and the state university system’s Board of Governors confirmed Hasner as the new president, with a base salary of $875,000 and a potential performance bonus of $150,000, according to his contract.
“When I step onto this campus, if I were to be the eighth president of this university, my commitment to you, sir, and my commitment to this board and my commitment to this entire university community is that I am not involved in partisan politics,” Hasner told trustees during the Feb. 10 meeting when they picked him. “I do not believe that it is politically red or politically blue to be a university president.”

‘Incredibly concerning’ and ‘unbelieveable’
The university of more than 31,000 students describes itself as a Hispanic-serving institution and the number-one Florida public university in terms of campus ethnic diversity.
Details of the paperwork FAU submitted to ICE, such as the number of officers it intends to deputize, have not been published.
Paula Muñoz, executive director of Florida Student Power Network, said that, considering Hasner’s background with GEO Group, she wasn’t surprised FAPD could be the first campus department to deputize its officers to act as immigration enforcement agents, which requires them to undergo a 40-hour online training.
“It’s incredibly concerning. It’s something that should not be a part of the education or institutions,” Muñoz said in a phone interview with Florida Phoenix. “They should be worried about how to make sure that students are feeling safe on campus.”
The pending agreement raised concerns for FAU junior Nicholas Ostheimer in light of the detention of nearly a dozen students and faculty across the country. He led the student protests against Hasner’s selection as president.
“It’s unbelievable and it’s an insult to our community and an attack on our freedoms,” Ostheimer told the Phoenix.
Push for as many ICE agreements as possible
Meanwhile, the DeSantis administration is pushing for cities and counties to enter into the agreements that the governor has characterized as the maximum level of collaboration and has said will lead to street-level enforcement. So far, Florida cities, counties, and state agencies have entered into 194 agreements with ICE, although some of the agreements are aimed at apprehending people without legal status already in jails and prisons.
In early March, the chief of Pinellas County Schools Police signed and submitted paperwork to enter into the task force model agreement with ICE without the knowledge or authorization of the school board and superintendent, which he later told the board he had done because he thought he had to comply.
The school district didn’t know about the agreement until the Phoenix contacted a spokesperson for comment.
FAU and ICE didn’t respond to the Phoenix’s request for comment.

Republicans looking to cut federal spending on Medicaid are eyeing work requirements as one possible option. (Justin Sullivan/Getty Images)Under an emerging Republican plan to require some Medicaid recipients to work, between 4.6 million and 5.2 million adults ages 19 to 55 could lose their health care coverage, according to a new analysis.
The study, conducted by Urban Institute researchers with support from the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation, calculated that up to 39% of the 13.3 million adults in that age group who became eligible for Medicaid when their states expanded the program under the Affordable Care Act would lose coverage if Congress required states to impose work rules.
The report suggests that most of those people would lose coverage not because they aren’t complying with the rules, but because they would struggle to report their compliance to the state.
“Most adults who would lose eligibility for federal Medicaid funding are working, engaged in work-related activities, or could qualify for exemptions not readily identifiable through state databases but could still face disenrollment because of the reporting requirements,” it states. The study identified several barriers to reporting, including lack of broadband access and lack of transportation.
Forty states plus the District of Columbia have expanded Medicaid under the ACA. Overall, nearly 72 million people, about a fifth of Americans, are enrolled in the program for low-income people, which is funded jointly by the federal government and the states.

Traditional Medicaid insurance was mainly available to children and their caregivers, people with disabilities and pregnant women. But the ACA, commonly known as Obamacare, allowed states to extend coverage to adults making up to 138% of the federal poverty level — about $21,000 a year for a single person.
Nationwide, more than 21 million people with low incomes have health insurance because of expanded Medicaid eligibility.
U.S. House Republicans in February pushed through a budget plan, now under consideration in the Senate, that would require about $880 billion in cuts to Medicaid over the next decade to help cover the cost of $4.5 trillion in tax cuts. The budget doesn’t contain specifics on how that target would be met. But work requirements are a likely money-saving option: A 2023 analysis from the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office found that imposing work rules on Medicaid recipients ages 19 to 55 who are not parents or caregivers would cut federal spending by an estimated $109 billion over the next 10 years.
The Congressional Budget Office based that projection on a plan the GOP-controlled U.S. House approved in 2023. That bill, the likely blueprint for the work requirements Republicans are considering now, would have required adults ages 19-55 to work, participate in a job training program or perform community service for at least 80 hours per month for three or more months in a calendar year. Parents and caretakers of dependent children, and those unable to work because of a health condition, would have been exempt.
Many Republican-led states are eager to impose work requirements on able-bodied Medicaid recipients. Thirteen states received permission to impose work rules on at least some Medicaid enrollees during the first Trump administration. Nine additional states requested permission to enact Medicaid work requirements during Trump’s earlier term but had not won approval by the time it ended.
When the Biden administration came into office, it rescinded all the approvals.
Supporters say requiring Medicaid recipients to work, study or train for a career gives them a boost toward self-sufficiency and financial stability. Critics, however, say such rules end up hurting far more people than they help.

The researchers from the Urban Institute mostly based their analysis on the experience of Arkansas, which in June 2018 became the first state to require some Medicaid recipients to work, volunteer, go to school or participate in job training to receive benefits. By the time a federal judge halted the policy in April 2019, 18,000 adults had lost coverage.
The researchers also looked at New Hampshire, which began implementing a work requirement but halted the program in July 2019 before suspending anyone’s coverage.
“What was found in a lot of qualitative research on the previous work requirement programs is that a lot of people were unaware of the policy, or they didn’t understand the policy,” said Michael Karpman, an Urban Institute researcher who co-authored the study.
“People who need coverage the most would do the most to try to maintain it. On the other hand, those people could also face the most difficulty with the administrative barriers,” Karpman said.
In a 2020 study examining how Arkansas’ last experience with work requirements played out, researchers from the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health “found no evidence that the policy succeeded in its stated goal of promoting work and instead found substantial evidence of harm to health care coverage and access.”
Arkansas Republican Gov. Sarah Huckabee Sanders announced in January that she would ask the federal government for permission to institute work requirements, regardless of what Congress decides. The state submitted the request last week.










Especially for a rural state like Arkansas, work requirements fail to take into account a lot of the realities that people may face.


– Christin Harper, Arkansas Advocates for Children and Families


Arkansas Republican state Rep. Aaron Pilkington, who serves on the health committee in his chamber, said lawmakers “learned our lesson from the last go-round.”
Pilkington said that under the new proposal, the state will only pause coverage instead of canceling it, giving recipients an opportunity to prove they are complying. And, he said, the online portal for reporting will be a lot more user-friendly.
“I think it’s a reasonable thing to ask for able-bodied people to look for work, or try to obtain work,” Pilkington said.
But Christin Harper, policy director for Arkansas Advocates for Children and Families, said even the new version would be a challenge for many enrollees. Many people on Medicaid are juggling multiple jobs, and having to report to the state every month would be a significant burden.
“Especially for a rural state like Arkansas, work requirements fail to take into account a lot of the realities that people may face,” Harper said. She added that “with the overall job market, job opportunities may or may not be available in some of these rural towns.”

(Photo: Galen Bacharier/NC Newsline)A new team in North Carolina Auditor Dave Boliek’s office would examine state agencies’ spending and job openings under a Republican-led bill.
The proposal, Senate Bill 474, contains echoes of the so-called Department of Government Efficiency or “DOGE” — the White House team led by Elon Musk that has eliminated wide swaths of the federal bureaucracy. But it would not have the power to solely cut jobs or spending — rather, it would send a report to legislators by the end of the year recommending any offices or jobs that should be dissolved.
The auditor’s new team — sporting an acronym of DAVE — would be allowed to use A.I. “and other appropriate tools” to look at state spending. Senate President Pro Tem Phil Berger (R-Rockingham), the bill’s main sponsor, said it would allow his office to look at whether taxpayer dollars and resources “are effectively deployed.”
Boliek, a Republican who was elected in November after defeating former Democratic Auditor Jessica Holmes, argues that the bill just affirms authority that his office already has — just with more resources. And it “lends credibility” to North Carolina’s governance, he said.
“This bill really formalizes the work that needs to be done,” Boliek told senators on the new Regulatory Reform Committee Wednesday. That work needs to be “based on data, not emotion,” he added.

Democratic lawmakers expressed wide-ranging concerns with the legislation. They said the bill risked politicizing a process that should be focused on objective measures, could use A.I. in a non-transparent way and could result in an even slimmer state workforce that many say is understaffed and that’s already struggling to fill vacancies.
“Behind every one of these jobs, we have a reason, a community, a team,” said Sen. Sophia Chitlik (D-Durham), who called the bill, and Musk’s DOGE, “job destroyers.”
Boliek pledged that his office would act in a nonpartisan way if the bill became law. And he acknowledged concerns with A.I., but said it was a good test case for its use in government.
“The fact is, we’ve got to start somewhere in the state of North Carolina using A.I.,” Boliek said. “Because it’s coming. There’s no better place than the state auditor’s office to get started with that.”

Ardis Watkins, executive director of the State Employees Association of North Carolina, said there was “genuine concern” among state workers.
“(This bill) presupposes that a conversation of government efficiency is about employee efficiency,” said Watkins, suggesting that lawmakers instead scrutinize contracts that spend taxpayer dollars.
North Carolina government has about 14,000 total vacancies, according to state officials. The head of the government’s HR office has said it can take six months to fill a single role; and lawmakers say they continue to hear complaints that wages are too low.
The bill would shut down the new auditor’s team at the end of 2028. It now heads to the Senate Rules Committee for further consideration.",https://ncnewsline.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/IMG_1385-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-04-02 13:09:31.233605

(Photos courtesy NMDOH)The New Mexico health department on Wednesday said obesity rates for third graders decreased for the fourth consecutive year.
The report from NMDOH’s Obesity, Nutrition and Physical Activity Program uses data from 40 schools across 21 counties, and assessed close to 2,950 students, according to a news release, which also noted that participation in the data collection is voluntary.

a decline in the past year in obesity rates for kindergarten students from 18.2% to 17.3%
a decline in obesity rates for third graders in the same time period from 27.5% to 24.1%
Boys’ obesity rates were 6.5% higher than girls.
Ongoing highest obesity prevalence among American Indian students at 27.6% of students

“We collect and analyze obesity data so we can invest our resources in areas that lack infrastructure for safe physical activity and opportunities to buy affordable healthy food,” Health Secretary Gina DeBlassie said in a statement. “Obesity in children highlights inequities in our community infrastructure and access to resources.”
According to the report, department’s childhood obesity surveillance program — established in 2010 — uses “body mass index (BMI) percentile and a standardized measurement protocol to monitor childhood obesity over time, identify at-risk groups, guide state and local prevention efforts, and inform appropriate resource allocation.”
Despite the improvements, the report notes that obesity remains a significant problem in New Mexico, particularly for children, with obesity increasing significantly between kindergarten and third grade.
“Childhood obesity is a complex issue that is influenced by weight bias, socioeconomic status, food insecurity and community infrastructure,” the report said, noting that in 2023, close to one-in-four (24.7%) school-aged children in New Mexico lived in poverty, compared to nearly one-in-six (15.7%) nationally in 2023. That makes “New Mexican children more at risk for obesity than children in other states,” the report said, and children with obesity are more likely to develop: high cholesterol, type 2 diabetes, hypertension, heart disease, stroke, fatty liver disease, sleep apnea and depression.
The health department program says part of its strategy to combat childhood obesity includes programs in seven counties and one Tribal community to expand activities such as farm-to-school food programs, exercise activities and nutrition programs.

(Brian Lyman/Alabama Reflector)An Alabama House committee Wednesday approved legislation to make it a crime to interfere with first responders working a scene after the sponsor removed language that critics said violated free speech rights.
HB 224, sponsored by Rep. Allen Treadaway, R-Morris, makes it a misdemeanor to loiter within 25 feet of a first responder after getting told to leave the scene or to interfere with either paramedics or law enforcement who were dispatched to the area.
“We are seeing more and more of this,” Treadaway told the House Public Safety and Homeland Security Committee. “Since I left four years ago a lot of this, when I was policing, we did not see.”

As originally filed, the bill included language that potentially criminalized people for verbally harassing or directing abusive language at first responders.
A substitute that Treadaway filed removed that section and required first responders to instruct people not to approach or leave the scene. If they refuse or return after they are told to leave, and remain within 25 feet of the first responder, they are then subject to arrest if they interfere with first responders while they are working a scene, or if they threaten them.
Those who violate the provisions in the bill are subject to a Class A misdemeanor, punishable by up to a year in jail and a $6,000 fine.
The radius for the crime was originally 100 feet. The substitute changed it to 25 feet. The original version also stated that those who loiter within 25 feet of a first responder after they were told to leave and interfere in the situation or make disparaging verbal comments or abusive language could then be charged with a Class A misdemeanor. The language was removed.
The House Public Safety and Homeland Security Committee considered the legislation after the committee hosted a public hearing in March prior to the spring recess.
Some still had concerns with the limit pertaining to distance.
“Is there anything that is going to tell the community that they are going to have to stay back 25 feet?” asked Rep. Tashina Morris, D-Montgomery.
Treadaway said that officers are trained to move a crowd back from a scene further than 25 feet and make it clear they cannot move any closer.
“We have this whole court system in our country that allows redress,” Treadaway said.
He said that individuals can use the court system to challenge the actions of law enforcement.
“If the officer is doing his job, he is videotaping everything, he is not going to put someone in jail that he has got to go before a judge,” Treadaway said. “We have this whole court system in this country that allows redress, so if you feel like you want to challenge it, just like a ticket, that is what we have a court for. Either you can pay for your ticket, or you can argue your case. An officer feels the same way.”
The bill moves to the full House.

(Makenzie Huber/South Dakota Searchlight)The U.S. Justice Department announced Tuesday that it will surge FBI assets across the country to address unresolved violent crimes in areas with high Native American populations, including crimes related to missing and murdered Indigenous people.
The FBI will send 60 personnel, rotating in 90-day temporary duty assignments over a six-month period. A news release described the effort as “Operation Not Forgotten” and said it will be “the longest and most intense national deployment of FBI resources to address Indian Country crime to date.”
Justice disparities on South Dakota reservations need attention, US attorney general says

FBI personnel will support field offices in Albuquerque; Denver; Detroit; Jackson, Mississippi; Minneapolis; Oklahoma City; Phoenix; Portland, Oregon; Seattle; and Salt Lake City. The FBI will work in partnership with other federal and tribal law enforcement agencies across jurisdictions, the Justice Department said, including the Bureau of Indian Affairs Missing and Murdered Unit.
The territory of the FBI’s Minneapolis office includes South Dakota. The U.S. attorney for the state, Alison Ramsdell, said in the news release that “these additional resources will aid in our effort to hold offenders accountable and achieve justice on behalf of victims.”
At the beginning of fiscal year 2025, the FBI’s Indian Country program had approximately 4,300 open investigations, including over 900 death investigations, 1,000 child abuse investigations, and more than 500 domestic violence and adult sexual abuse investigations, according to the news release.
“Crime rates in American Indian and Alaska Native communities are unacceptably high,” U.S. Attorney General Pam Bondi said in the release. “By surging FBI resources and collaborating closely with U.S. attorneys and tribal law enforcement to prosecute cases, the Department of Justice will help deliver the accountability that these communities deserve.”
FBI director Kash Patel said in the news release that “the FBI will manhunt violent criminals on all lands” and also “find those who have gone missing.”

(Brandon Bell/Getty Images)A significant majority of North Carolina residents oppose laws that would allow people to carry concealed handguns without a permit, according to polls released in recent days by Elon University and the advocacy group Everytown for Gun Safety.
Though it was conducted several months ago, the Everytown for Gun Safety survey, released Wednesday, found that a large majority of likely North Carolina voters (77%) were against removing permit requirements from concealed carry laws.
Global Strategy Group conducted a survey of 800 likely voters in North Carolina between September 4 and September 9, 2024 for Everytown for Gun Safety. The poll had a margin of error of +/- 3.5%.
The Elon University poll, released last Thursday, found that 54% of respondents opposed dropping the concealed carry permit while only 34% support such a change.
The Elon poll was conducted March 3 through 11, 2025, with a sample of 800 North Carolina adults and a margin of error of +/- 4.04%.
Poll director Prof. Jason Husser told NC Newsline he found it particularly noteworthy that a large percentage of Republicans had concerns about permitless carry and that less than half (48%) favor removing the requirement. While he noted that the survey did not explore the question in depth, Husser opined that “many of the Republicans who have these permits feel like it was not that invasive or intrusive to have the process — they already went through it, and don’t really see a need to change it.”
The analyses come as state legislators are debating Senate Bill 50 and House Bill 5, two measures aiming to enact what supporters call “constitutional carry” — the idea that individuals should be able to carry concealed weapons without permits due to their Second Amendment rights.
Current North Carolina law requires individuals to obtain a permit from their local sheriff’s office and undergo an eight-hour training course in order to carry a concealed firearm.
In addition to the bulk of North Carolinians opposing permitless carry, the Everytown polling found that 66% of gun owners did as well.
85% of women are against permitless carry, as are 66% of men, the Everytown survey found.
There was a similar trend when considering political party. 96% of Democrats, 77% of independents, and 60% of Republicans oppose permitless carry, according to the Everytown poll.
In each category surveyed across partisan, gender, racial, and education groups, more people were against permitless carry than in support.
“The data couldn’t be clearer — North Carolinians don’t want to live in a state where untrained, potentially dangerous individuals can carry hidden guns in our communities. This isn’t just a policy issue; it’s a matter of public safety,” said Wendy Brooks, a volunteer with the North Carolina chapter of Moms Demand Action, Everytown Survivor Fellow, and gun owner.
At the North Carolina state legislature, Senate Bill 50 passed the Senate on March 20 and is now in the House, while House Bill 5 awaits approval from another committee in the lower chamber.
On Tuesday, the House Judiciary 2 Committee approved House Bill 193, a measure that would allow handguns in private schools.
“If North Carolina lawmakers truly want to represent their constituents, including gun owners and Republicans, they should reject this reckless attempt to dismantle the concealed carry permitting system and instead focus on real solutions that will keep communities safe,” said Angela Ferrell-Zabala, executive director of Moms Demand Action.",https://ncnewsline.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Gun-deaths-Getty.jpg,,,2025-04-02 13:09:31.233605

U.S. Sen. Adam Schiff, in a news release issued Tuesday, cited Martin’s actions since being named interim U.S. attorney as the reason for the hold.
“For the past nine weeks, Ed Martin has consistently undermined the independence and abused the power of the U.S. Attorney’s office in DC – openly threatening and intimidating political opponents, dismissing charges against his own clients, firing public servants for their roles in legitimate investigations, and using his office as a cudgel to chill dissent and free speech,” Schiff said. “No one embodies Donald Trump’s personal weaponization of the Justice Department more than Ed Martin.”
Martin did not respond to a message seeking comment Wednesday morning.
Martin, who grew up in New Jersey, has spent most of his adult life in Missouri since attending St. Louis University Law School. After almost two years as chief of staff to Gov. Matt Blunt from January 2006 to November 2007, Martin twice ran unsuccessfully for office.
Martin sought the Third District seat in Congress in 2010 and was the Republican nominee for Missouri attorney general in 2012.
Martin was originally tapped by President Donald Trump to run the Office of Management and Budget. But in January, Trump shifted Martin to the D.C. prosecutor’s office.
Martin, who resigned in January after 10 years as president of Phyllis Schlafly Eagles, worked as a defense attorney for people charged with crimes for the Jan. 6, 2021, assault on the U.S. Capitol. Since taking office in an interim appointment Jan. 22, Martin has drawn criticism from Democrats who accuse him of making political decisions about prosecutions.
In early March, 10 senate Democrats complained about Martin to the D.C. Office of Disciplinary Counsel. The complaint said he had dismissed criminal charges against his own clients and threatened  prosecution against government employees to intimidate them, the Hill reported.
In a news release, Schiff said he was blocking Martin’s nomination because of his “troubling conduct in his months as Interim U.S. Attorney in the same role.”
The nomination must get passed the Senate Judiciary Committee before going to the Senate for confirmation. 
“For the past few weeks, Ed Martin has been a one-man wrecking ball,” Schiff wrote Tuesday on social media. “Threatening political opponents, firing public servants, and using his office to chill free speech. His nomination must be blocked.”

Andy Beshear is taking the Kentucky legislature to court over a new law that limits the executive branch's authority to enact regulations. (Kentucky Lantern photo by Liam Niemeyer)Democratic Kentucky Gov. Andy Beshear has gone to court to block what the lawsuit calls the “latest power grab” by the GOP-controlled legislature.
At issue is a new law that curbs the executive branch’s authority to make regulations. The bill was a priority for the conservative group Americans for Prosperity which is pushing the measure in multiple states and the U.S. Congress.
In a complaint filed in Franklin Circuit Court on March 28, attorneys for the Office of the Governor and the Public Protection Cabinet wrote House Bill 6  is unconstitutional because it essentially hands over control of a state executive branch function and power — issuing and implementing regulations — to the legislature. 
Attorneys for the plaintiffs write the debate over HB 6 on the House floor “clearly shows the legislative branch is intentionally violating the strict separation of powers” in the Kentucky Constitution. Attorneys pointed to comments made by Rep. T.J. Roberts, R-Burlington, on the House floor last month in which Roberts said “they better ask us for permission before they engage in executive branch lawmaking.” 
Franklin Circuit Court Judge Phillip Shepherd held a hearing on the case Wednesday morning to consider the plaintiffs’ request to temporarily block the law. The Lantern has not yet confirmed whether the plaintiffs’ request was granted or denied Wednesday.
A request for comment sent to a spokesperson for Republicans in the Kentucky House of Representatives was not immediately returned. 
The Republican-controlled legislature passed HB 6, dubbed the REINS Act or Regulations from the Executive in Need of Scrutiny, over a veto by Beshear in the final days of this year’s legislative session. The legislation went into immediate effect on March 27 because of the bill’s emergency clause.
HB 6, primarily sponsored by Rep. Wade Williams, R-Madisonville, would prevent executive branch agencies from filing, amending  or repealing regulations unless the regulations meet one of six prerequisites. Wade in a previous statement touted the bill as a way to put “common sense boundaries on the regulatory powers of unelected government employees.”
Those prerequisites include that the regulation will not cost more than $500,000 over two years to implement; is needed immediately to “to meet an imminent threat” to public health, safety, or welfare; is needed to prevent the loss of funds or meet a deadline established in laws or regulations; or is needed relating to the licensure of health facilities and services. 
The lawsuit names Emily Caudill, the regulations compiler for the Legislative Research Commission, as the defendant. Attorneys for the governor wrote HB 6 gives Caudill the power to determine whether regulations can be filed including when the legislature is not in session. 
The governor also says HB 6 restrictions could prevent the implementation of laws passed by the legislature this year, such as  creation of a Parkinson’s Disease registry that state officials estimate could have an upfront cost of at least $635,000. Another law that the complaint states could be impacted is a move to license retailers who sell nicotine which has regulatory costs that could reach into the millions of dollars, exceeding the limits in HB 6.
The passage of HB 6 was applauded by the conservative advocacy group Americans for Prosperity-Kentucky (AFP-KY), a part of a network of political groups affiliated with businessmen Charles Koch and the late David Koch.
AFP-KY State Director Heather LeMire said in a statement that while the governor can “grandstand,” his lawsuit claims are off base. 
“If the governor or his administration had read the law, they would know that it has a stipulation for regulations that come out of legislation for the executive branch to promulgate these regulations, as well as a generous stipulation for the governor’s emergency powers,” LeMire said. “It is clear that Governor Beshear wants to avoid accountability and make policy, but that is the job of the legislature. If he is set on being a policymaker, we welcome his resignation so he can run for the General Assembly in November of 2026.”

(Photo by Dana Wormald/New Hampshire Bulletin)Seven years ago, we were in a tight spot. 
My wife, daughters, and I were sharing a house in central New Hampshire with my parents, and even that frugal living arrangement wasn’t enough to make it affordable for any of us after a while. The property taxes were too high and climbing (even in our tight-fisted red town), the cost of upkeep became prohibitive, and there were too many years of paychecks going in the wrong direction. Amid that tense mess, my dad passed away — of course it was his heart — and my sister and her family ended up selling their place next door and taking over the old house, in part so my mom could stay. We all agreed it was the best option of the few available to our extended clan. Meanwhile, the four of us — the family within the family — found a starter home we felt like we could afford and began again in a new town with new schools for the girls. It wasn’t the softest landing, for any of us.
We were unmoored. 
The first year in that new life was tough, and we almost lost everything. My wife and I were both working full time but carrying a lot of credit card debt. The minimum payments combined with the mortgage, utilities, and other standard living expenses left us with nothing at the end of the month. If you didn’t know us, if you weren’t there, it would be as good a guess as any that the debt was a result of us living beyond our means. After all, every family has to live within a budget, and every family needs to learn how to trim the fat.
The thing is, there wasn’t any. The thousands in debt wasn’t the result of vacations; we never took any. It wasn’t for nights on the town or Amazon splurges. It is just how much extra it cost, added up over the first 15 years of our life together, to keep a young family of four afloat in New Hampshire. It was for urgent home and car repairs that we didn’t see coming, school clothes and supplies for the girls, all of those incidental bills that turn ledgers red.
In the end, we felt our only option — after exploring all of them — was to do precisely what the experts say you should not do: We cashed out part of my 401(k) to pay off the debt. For us, the choice amounted to sink now or struggle later. In other words, there was no choice at all.  
I’m sharing all of these personal details, and uncomfortably so, not because I think my family’s story is unique but because in most ways it isn’t. In America, it is so very expensive to have nothing. And that is why political debate in this country strikes me as a kind of madness. We have created a system that exerts endless economic pressure on the middle and lower classes, and the big myth is that whoever you perceive to be below you on that class ladder is the primary, and undeserving, beneficiary of your hard work, your taxes, your struggle. But they are not. And I have to believe — or at least hope — that all of you will see that one day, whatever political party you support.
The whole of the American political establishment — long owned by the actual beneficiaries of that downward economic pressure — serves as the architect for the grand illusion. But the American right takes the cake — has long taken the cake — for subterfuge and misdirection, and it’s a bitter bite. 
In this state, they say:
Don’t ask about the $1.17 billion in lost tax revenue for New Hampshire due to all those ill-advised business tax cuts. The real problem is the transgender women and girls entering our public bathrooms and playing on our school soccer fields.
How can you talk about the N.H. GOP’s repeal of the interest and dividends tax in service to the rich, and the loss of another $150 million-plus toward public services, when we are so clearly under attack by murderous migrants?
Sure, your property taxes are high and getting higher, but don’t blame New Hampshire’s aversion to progressive taxation. The problem, you see, is that school districts are spending all of your hard-earned money on smut and critical race theory lessons.
Speaking of schools, pay no mind to how the Republican voucher program is diverting public money to private and religious schools, amid questionable transparency, and adding to the struggles of our beleaguered public schools. But do you know what you should worry about? People who have very little — those ne’er-do-wells enrolled in Medicaid and SNAP — taking advantage of the system. That’s a much bigger deal than billionaires like Donald Trump, Elon Musk, Jeff Bezos, and Mark Zuckerberg endlessly profiting from a system largely built by and for people just like them.
And don’t worry: Those forever-do-wells will totally have your back once the IRS is too gutted to come after them, environmental regulations no longer stand in the way of their manifest destiny, and the rich-guy tax cuts are extended. The first drops of that multiplied wealth in the top 1 percent might not trickle down to the rest in this lifetime, but just you wait. I mean, if you can’t trust a billionaire and his economic enablers, who can you?
In the years since my wife and I tapped our future to salvage our present, we have never regretted the decision. We’re still here, after all. But the pressure points never go away, and new ones are added. There will be a reckoning when we retire, if we can retire, and the debt pattern is repeating with our daughters through no fault of their own. We worry, constantly, about college costs (even for in-state tuition), the extremely high price of housing, and the direction of a state whose political majority chases every trumped up political issue that comes down the pike while avoiding or worsening the ones that really matter.
As I said, there is nothing particularly unique about our story, except maybe for one thing: We were lucky. Crazy lucky. We’re still standing because we had a small retirement plan to tap, but one little thing could have sent us reeling again in a heartbeat — a lost job, a health issue, even a major home repair would have done it. Would still do it. And now, with state and federal cuts to services underway, I know that a lot of people just like us are about to feel the crushing weight of that final straw.
Why is it so hard to get by when you’ve done everything right, or tried anyway? Shouldn’t paying the bills be a little easier, just a little bit, in the richest country in the world?
If those questions don’t form the immovable center of our politics, I have no idea what it is we are doing.",https://newhampshirebulletin.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/grandillusion-1024x720.jpg,,,2025-04-02 12:09:45.662095

The collective nonprofit fundraiser continues through 6 p.m. (Screenshot)There’s no better motivation than a crisis.
Just ask organizers of this year’s 401Gives online fundraising event, which has already shattered its previous record and hit its $4 million goal six hours ahead of deadline, United Way of Rhode Island announced Wednesday morning. 
Now in its sixth year, the 36-hour event aims to leverage collective and coordinated fundraising to help Rhode Island’s nonprofits. As of 11:30 a.m. Wednesday, with six-and-a-half hours until the 6 p.m. end of the event, nearly 17,000 donors had contributed to one or more of the 640 participating nonprofits, according to the online fundraising dashboard. That’s a $300,000 increase over the $3.7 million collected during the 2024 401Gives event, and $1.14 million more than had been received at this time a year ago, according to United Way.
“We’ve surpassed our goal and are still raising the bar,” Cortney Nicolato, United Way’s president and CEO, said in a statement. “Rhode Islanders have come out in full force to support their local nonprofits and to get behind the causes that are important to them. We go into every 401Gives with extreme optimism, and right now we’re seeing a level of giving that’s simply incredible. I can’t wait to see where we finish later today.”
The record breaking amount of fundraising and participation — from donors and nonprofit beneficiaries — comes as nonprofits nationwide continue to scramble to keep services running and employees paid amid federal funding cuts imposed by the Trump administration. 
Michael Cerio, a United Way spokesperson, attributed the record-level generosity of Rhode Islanders directly to the uncertainty that federal policies have created for nonprofits.
Over 90 participating nonprofits have raised at least $10,000 apiece since the fundraiser began Monday morning. The 640 beneficiaries include 129 first-time participants, according to United Way. Rhode Island Current is among the returning nonprofits raising money through the 2025 event.
Foster Forward, which has led fundraising among nonprofit recipients for several years, continues to lead the charts in donations received, with nearly $335,000 from 350 donors as of midday. The Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. Community Center in Newport and the Audubon Society of Rhode Island rounded out the top three, with $150,800 and $103,00 raised, respectively. The Alliance of Rhode Island Southeast Asians for Education led in the number of donations, with 474 donors just before noon Wednesday.
The 36-hour event continues through 6 p.m. Wednesday. To donate, and for more information, visit www.401gives.org.

(SHAWN THEW/EPA/BLOOMBERG VIA GETTY IMAGES)Five years ago, the CEO of one of the largest pain clinic companies in the Southeast was sentenced to more than three years in prison after being convicted in a $4 million illegal kickback scheme.
But after just four months behind bars, John Estin Davis walked free. President Donald Trump commuted Davis’ sentence in the last days of his first term. In a statement explaining the decision, the White House said that “no one suffered financially” from Davis’ crime.
In court, however, the Trump administration was saying something very different. As the president let him go, the Department of Justice alleged in a civil lawsuit that Davis and his company defrauded taxpayers out of tens of millions of dollars with excessive urine drug testing. The DOJ alleged that Comprehensive Pain Specialists made such a “staggering” sum from cups of pee that employees had given the testing a profit-minded nickname: “liquid gold.”
Davis and the company denied all allegations in court filings and settled the DOJ’s fraud lawsuit without any determination of liability. Davis declined to comment for this article.
Since returning to the White House, Trump has said he will target fraud in Medicare, Medicaid, and Social Security, and his Republican allies in Congress have made combating fraud a key argument in their plans to slash spending on Medicaid, which provides health care for millions of low-income and disabled Americans. During an address to Congress last month, Trump said his administration had found “hundreds of billions of dollars of fraud” without citing any specific examples of fraud.
“Taken back a lot of that money,” Trump said. “We got it just in time.”
But Trump’s history of showing leniency to convicted fraudsters contrasts with his present-day crackdown. In his first and second terms, Trump has granted pardons or commutations to at least 68 people convicted of fraud crimes or of interfering with fraud investigations, according to a KFF Health News review of court and clemency records, DOJ press releases, and news reports. At least 13 of those fraudsters were convicted in cases involving more than $1.6 billion of fraudulent claims filed with Medicare and Medicaid, according to the Department of Justice.
  John Estin Davis, former CEO of Comprehensive Pain Specialists, who was convicted of health care fraud, was granted clemency by President Donald Trump in 2021. At the same time, the Department of Justice was suing Davis for allegedly orchestrating a much larger health care fraud scheme. Davis and CPS later settled the lawsuit without any admission of wrongdoing. (Heidi de Marco/KFF Health News)
And as one of the first actions of his second term, Trump fired 17 independent inspectors general responsible for rooting out fraud and waste in government.
“It sends a really bad message and really hurts DOJ efforts at creating deterrence,” said Jacob Elberg, a former assistant U.S. attorney and law professor at Seton Hall University in New Jersey. “In order to reduce health care fraud, you need people both to be afraid of getting in trouble, but also for people to believe in the legitimacy of the system.”
Elberg said considerable fraud in Medicare and Medicaid exists largely because the programs’ “pay-and-chase models” prioritize paying for patient care first and tracking down stolen dollars second. To prevent more fraud, the programs would likely need to be redesigned in ways that would be slower and more cumbersome for all patients, Elberg said.
Regardless, Elberg said the president’s claimed focus on fraud appears to be a pretext for slashing spending that has been legally appropriated by Congress. Trump has empowered the Elon Musk-led Department of Government Efficiency, which he established and named by executive order, to make deep cuts in federal budgets, halting some medical research and aid programs in addition to cutting spending on climate change, transgender health, and diversity, equity, and inclusion programs.
“What’s been the focal point to date of the administration is not what anybody has ever referred to as health care fraud,” Elberg said. “There is a real blurring — a seemingly intentional blurring — between what is actually fraud and what is just spending that they are not in favor of.”
Jerry Martin, who served as a U.S. attorney for the Middle District of Tennessee under President Barack Obama and now represents health care fraud whistleblowers, also said Trump’s focus on fraud appeared to be “just a platform to attack things that they don’t agree with” rather than “a genuine desire to root out and combat fraud.”
Even so, Martin said some of his whistleblower clients have been emboldened.
“I’ve had clients repeat back to me ‘President Trump says fraud is a priority,’” Martin said. “People are listening to it. But I don’t know that what he’s saying translates into what they believe.”
The White House did not respond to requests for comment for this article.
A billion-follar fraud case and needless eye injections
Presidents enjoy the unique authority to erase federal convictions and prison sentences with pardons and commutations. In theory, the power is intended to be a final bulwark against injustice or overly harsh punishment. But many presidents have been accused of using the pardon power to reward powerful allies and close associates as they leave the White House.
Trump issued about 190 pardons and commutations in the final two months of his first term, including for some health care fraudsters convicted of schemes with astonishing costs.
For example, Trump granted a commutation to Philip Esformes, a Florida health care executive convicted in 2019 of a $1.3 billion Medicare and Medicaid fraud scheme. After he was sentenced, DOJ announced in a press release that “the man behind one of the biggest health care frauds in history will be spending 20 years in prison.” Trump freed him 14 months later.
Trump also granted a commutation to Salomon Melgen, a Florida eye doctor who was serving a 17-year prison sentence for defrauding Medicare of $42 million. Melgen falsely diagnosed patients with eye diseases, then gave them unnecessary care, including laser treatments and painful eye injections, according to DOJ and court documents.
“Salomon Melgen callously took advantage of patients who came to him fearing blindness,” said a DOJ news release after Melgen was sentenced in 2018. “They received medically unreasonable and unnecessary tests and procedures that victimized his patients and the American taxpayer.”
DOJ: $70 Million Spent on ‘Excessive’ Urine Testing
Despite the flurry of pardons and commutations at the end of Trump’s first term, the leniency he showed Davis was unique. Davis was the only convicted health care fraudster to receive clemency while the Trump administration was simultaneously accusing him of more fraud.
As CEO of Comprehensive Pain Specialists from 2011 to 2017, Davis oversaw a rapid expansion to more than 60 locations across 12 states, according to federal court documents.
He was indicted in 2018 for using his CEO position to refer Medicare patients in need of medical equipment to a conspirator in return for kickbacks paid through a shell company, according to court documents. He was convicted at trial in April 2019 of defrauding Medicare.
Three months later, the DOJ filed a fraud lawsuit against Davis and CPS that piggybacked on the claims of seven whistleblowers. The lawsuit alleged that CPS collected more than $70 million from federal insurance programs for urine drug testing, most of which was “excessive,” and that an audit of a sampling of the tests had found at least 93% “lacked medical necessity.”
  A urine sample is displayed at the Comprehensive Pain Specialists laboratory in 2017. The Department of Justice has alleged in a fraud lawsuit that samples like this one were tested excessively, sometimes up to 51 times. CPS denied all allegations and settled the lawsuit without admitting any liability. (Heidi de Marco/KFF Health News)
Typically, government insurance programs pay for urine testing so pain clinics can verify that patients are taking their prescriptions properly and not abusing any other drugs, which could contribute to an overdose. Patients could be tested as little as once a year or as often as monthly depending on their level of risk, according to the DOJ lawsuit.
But Comprehensive Pain Specialists performed “myriad urine drug testing on virtually every CPS patient on virtually every visit” then conducted “at least 16 different types of tests” on each sample, and sometimes as many as 51, according to the lawsuit.
Trump commuted Davis’ sentence for his criminal conviction in January 2021 as the DOJ was finalizing a settlement in the civil lawsuit. The commutation was supported by country music star Luke Bryan, according to a White House statement.
Months later, with President Joe Biden in office, CPS and its owners agreed to repay $4.1 million — less than 10% of the damages sought in the suit — and the case was closed.
In the settlement, Davis agreed not to take any job where he would ever again bill Medicare or other federal health care programs. He was not required to personally repay anything.
Martin, who represented one of the whistleblowers who first raised allegations against Davis and CPS, said the leniency that Trump showed to him and other health care fraudsters may discourage DOJ employees from pursuing similar investigations during his second term.
“There are a lot of rank-and-file people who are operating at the lowest point in their professional careers, where they’ve seen a lot of their work essentially be water under the bridge,” Martin said. “That’s got to be really demoralizing.”

(Photo courtesy of David Hinckley)Party leadership of the centrist United Utah Party announced on Wednesday they have plans to merge with the Utah Forward Party. 
They announced in a news release issued Wednesday morning that a formal agreement for the merger will be presented at a joint organizing convention later this month, scheduled for April 26. 
Party leaders say the move would be “unprecedented.”
“If consummated, it is believed to be the first ever merger of political parties in the state of Utah,” the release stated. 
The announcement comes less than a month after a Republican state senator, Sen. Dan Thatcher, of West Valley City, unaffiliated with the GOP and instead joined the Utah Forward Party — a centrist party that has the slogan “Not left. Not right. Forward.”

Party leadership said “discussions about a possible merger have been taking place for many months and have been recently accelerated, building on the momentum of the news” that Thatcher was switching parties. 
“Since 2017 the UUP has been a home to disenfranchised voters and candidates who bravely opted out of an obviously dysfunctional two-party system,” said Utah Forward Party Chair Adam Teuscher. “They’ve worked tirelessly to give voters a quality third option. They believe that electeds should put the interests of their constituents over those of party bosses. Forward stands for the same, but we do so as part of a 50-state movement.”
While Teuscher said the United Utah Party “blazed this path,” through the merger, “we hope to widen it.” 
United Utah Party Chair Ladd Johnson also applauded the merger as a strategic move to further the centrist movement. 
“The United Utah Party’s long-term vision has always been to start locally and build-up a grass-roots political movement in Utah before eventually joining together with similar movements from other states,” Johnson said. “The proposed merger with the Forward Party is an important and exciting step in furthering that vision.”
Johnson added that the United Utah Party’s membership will bring “the experience, excellent platform and approach, and dedicated leaders” to combine “with the talent, energy and national presence of the Forward Party.” 
According to state voter registration statistics, the United Utah Party had about 2,210 active registered party members as of Monday, while the Utah Forward Party had 200. That’s compared to 933,827 members of the Republican Party, which dominates much of the state, and 241,633 Democrats.

Johnson told Utah News Dispatch in an interview Wednesday morning that even though the United Utah Party currently has more local members than the Utah Forward Party, the merger is proposed to join a growing national movement. 
“When (the Forward Party) formed in Utah, we didn’t join them immediately, and we were sort of just checking in and seeing how things are going, but we’ve worked closely with them,” Johnson said, adding that the two parties co-hosted candidate events during the 2024 election. “As they continue to grow nationally, we just felt the timing is really good. Let’s do this. We feel like it’s an hour of need for our country, and so we’re excited to be part of a bigger movement.” 
Johnson added that “we’ll still keep all of our Utah values and policies and hard work here, but now we can more easily speak to national matters as well.” 
While the United Utah and Forward Party’s registration numbers are small compared to the GOP, Johnson also noted that because the Utah Republican Party holds closed primaries, there are potentially thousands of Utahns who believe in their more moderate platform but don’t register so they can still weigh in on Republican primaries. 
“We’ve got tens of thousands of supporters who don’t register with us because they want to vote in the Republican primary, and we’re fine with that,” Johnson said. 
He pointed to United Utah candidate Michelle Quist’s bid for attorney general last year. In that race, Quist got 7.16% of the vote, equal to 103,831 votes. Republican Derek Brown won with 57.8%, with 838,445 votes. 
“So we’ve got a lot of support out there, but it’s never going to show up in registered party members until we get rid of the closed primaries,” Johnson said. 
Utah independents fell short this election. Will the movement fizzle — or grow? 

The decision to merge — or not — ultimately falls to party members, however. During the organizing convention on April 26, members will vote on whether to execute a memorandum of understanding. 
According to the terms of the MOU, a combined interim executive committee would be appointed from existing party leadership to oversee the merger process in accordance with state law. 
Johnson said United Utah party leadership have “taken the temperature” of party members’ appetite for the merger, and “everyone that I’ve talked to is very enthusiastic about it,” though he acknowledged it’s somewhat “bittersweet.” 
“There’s been a lot of blood, sweat and tears put into this party to get it up and running and keep it running,” Johnson said. “So it’s kind of like a founder selling his business. It feels a little bittersweet, maybe to some people. But my expectation is that the members will support it, just based on the anecdotal conversations I’ve had.” 
Johnson added that Utah’s third-party members and candidates are now “just really excited that we’ll have a bigger platform to attract more folks to be able to work with us.” 
In their efforts to shake up a two-party system, Johnson said over the years Utahns have told him, “We really like what you’re doing, (but) it would be great to be part of a national movement.” 
“So for those people who maybe haven’t joined us yet, this may be the item that brings them on board officially,” he said. 
Party leadership encouraged Utahns to get involved ahead of the state organizing convention.
“While voting to approve the merger will be limited to those who were legacy party members prior to the date of this announcement, the public is invited to attend,” the parties said in the news release. “We welcome all Utahns broadly interested in election reform and the independent political space.”

Parker Michels-Boyce for The Virginia MercuryBon Secours and commercial health insurer Cigna have reached a deal to keep over 30,000 Virginians in-network, averting interruptions in care and higher health care costs for patients after months of protracted contract negotiations and uncertainty. 
The new multi-year agreement, reached by the Catholic health care system and insurer April 1 following a 24-hour deadline extension, means that Bon Secours hospitals, doctors, urgent care centers, ambulatory surgical centers and other care centers will remain in-network and accessible to Virginia citizens whose workplace health insurance is provided by Cigna. 
“We believe that access to quality health care services is vital for our community members. After several months of negotiations, we are pleased to have reached a new agreement that protects our patients’ access to affordable, compassionate care close to home,” Dr. C. Bart Rountree, executive medical director of Women’s & Children’s Services for Bon Secours Richmond, said in a statement on Wednesday.
The crux of the contract conflict, Bon Secours previously stated, was Cigna’s reimbursement rates, which the health care system said were not “keeping pace with inflation and are below fair market standards. Being fairly reimbursed by our payer partners (insurance companies) is what
enables us to continue to deliver the highest quality of care to our patients.” Cigna, in turn, had alleged that Bon Secours wanted a rate increase equaling 30% over five years, according to the Richmond Times-Dispatch. 
The dispute had been dragging on since August of 2024, fueling concern from patients insured through Cigna as they watched and wondered if they would still be able to see their preferred provider at Bon Secours facilities should negotiations fail.
But a state law enacted in 2024 allows health care providers to continue treating patients at least 90 days after the provider disconnects from the insurer’s network. Pregnant people can continue receiving care during the postpartum period, under this measure. Patients with a life-threatening condition may receive up to 180 days of care after their provider goes out-of-network, and people being treated at in-patient facilities may continue to be cared for by their provider until they are discharged.
The following Bon Secours hospitals in Virginia are impacted by the health system’s renewed agreement with Cigna:
Hampton Roads:
Bon Secours – Mary Immaculate Hospital
Bon Secours – Maryview Medical Center
Bon Secours – Southampton Medical Center
Bon Secours – Harbour View Medical Center

Andy Beshear has declared a state of emergency for Kentucky ahead of expected storms and possible tornadoes over the next four days.
Beshear warned of “severe storms that are intense and long-lived” and a risk of tornadoes, hail, flooding and high winds across Kentucky.
Under his emergency order, Kentucky Emergency Operations Center, transportation officials and the Kentucky National Guard will be ready to respond if they’re needed.
“Tornadoes are expected, and I know that’s tough to hear. And we are most concerned about the area of Western Kentucky that has gotten hit far too much, as well as a wider area of Western Kentucky,” Beshear said in a statement. “Remember, these can be strong tornadoes, EF-2 and greater. We’re really concerned about people’s safety, especially in the overnight, because when storms or tornadoes hit while people are asleep, that’s sadly when we’ve lost the most people. So, everybody out there, be really careful.”
What’s expected?
West Kentucky and Western Kentucky are at the highest risk for tornadoes and other storms, according to the National Weather Service. Central Kentucky is under an “enhanced risk” and Eastern Kentucky is under “marginal” risk, according to NWS.
Starting Wednesday night, Western and West Kentucky can expect “a major outbreak of severe storms with strong, long track tornadoes, very large hail and damaging winds,” according to the National Weather Service. Winds could reach 70 miles per hour.
On Thursday and Friday, West Kentuckians in Fulton, Hickman, Carlisle, Ballard, McCracken, Graves and the surrounding areas may experience flash flooding, “rapid rises on area rivers,” heavy rain and severe storms, according to NWS. Paducah is under a flash flood warning through Sunday and may see record-breaking rainfall.
NWS predicts up to 15 inches of rain in West Kentucky, with Western and Central Kentucky expecting a maximum of 10 inches.
Louisville is under a flood watch through Thursday.
Tips for safety
The National Weather Service recommends these safety tips during the type of storms Kentucky is bracing for:

Find shelter during the storm. Have a plan to go somewhere safe if you need to.
Do not drive through standing water.
Keep a flashlight, shoes and cell phone near your bed while you sleep. Make sure your phone is charged and weather alerts are turned on.
During a tornado, get as low as possible — the lowest room in the home, under a table. Get under something heavy and sturdy to protect yourself from debris.

A bill regulating usage of artificial intelligence in elections received a hearing last week and is awaiting executive action.
Senate Bill 25, brought by Sen. Janet Ellis, D-Helena, adds definitions and disallows so-called “deepfakes” within 60 days of an election. There is an exception — if the media is marked as being artificially generated or edited, they would be allowed and the bill has a long list of stipulations depending on the media type.
“This isn’t something attacking free speech,” Ellis said in a March 25 hearing before the House State Administration Committee.
Candidates have two options for dealing with deep fakes — they’d be able to file an injunction and have the option of filing a complaint with the commissioner of political practices.
The injunctive relief for a candidate targeted by a deep fake is supposed to be immediate, with the bill going so far as to say it “must be expedited by the district court and given preference over all other matters currently before the district court upon showing of present or ongoing harm.”
A second offense would be a misdemeanor. The bill did generate some discussion over the specifics of the exceptions, with Ronda Wiggers of the Montana Broadcasters Association providing some soft opposition.
Her opposition boiled down to who would be accountable for running the material. The bill contains language that says “the person, corporation, committee, political party, or other entity knew or should have known (the material) is a deepfake of a candidate or political party on the ballot.”
Wiggers said she’d like to see that language removed.
“So we would like you to strike the words ‘or should have known,’ that’s all,” Wiggers said. “So that we don’t have to try to figure out how we should have known that something was a deep fake.”
There are 20 states with laws on the books regarding artificial intelligence in elections, according to the National Conference on State Legislatures. It’s a rapidly developing field and there’s worry it will continue to be an issue in upcoming elections.
SB 25 seeks to address the problem before it becomes one in Montana, like much of the tech and artificial intelligence legislation this session.
“I don’t know how much of that is going on in Montana, but it’s a real problem in this country,” said Sen. Pat Flowers, D-Belgrade, at a press availability Tuesday. “And I think we’re trying to get out in front of all those kinds of bad behaviors when it comes to AI.”
Elections have changed, Flowers said. Campaigns are getting “icky” House Minority Leader Katie Sullivan added.
“We’ve opened the flood gates, and campaign spending and the social media component is outrageous and is used more and more and more by campaigns,” Sullivan, D-Missoula, said. 
She said the technology to make “deepfakes” of candidates is accessible to a lot of people.
“I would anticipate people would absolutely use that if they could. We should absolutely outlaw it,” Sullivan said.",https://dailymontanan.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/GettyImages-1428262683-1024x576.jpg,,,2025-04-02 12:09:45.662095

Free.,"Judge orders fired federal probationary workers reinstated in 19 states, D.C.",Ashley Murray,,,,,https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/judge-orders-fired-federal-probationary-workers-reinstated-19-states-dc,,"WASHINGTON — A federal judge in Maryland late Tuesday ordered federal agencies across 19 states and the District of Columbia to reinstate thousands of probationary workers who were fired as part of White House adviser Elon Musk’s government-slashing agenda.U.S. Judge James Bredar for the District of Maryland issued the preliminary injunction mandating 20 federal departments and agencies rehire the new or recently promoted employees whose duty stations or residences prior to termination were in the following states:Arizona, California, Colorado, Connecticut, Delaware, District of Columbia, Hawaii, Illinois, Maryland, Massachusetts, Michigan, Minnesota, Nevada, New Jersey, New Mexico, New York, Oregon, Rhode Island, Vermont and Wisconsin.The lawsuit is among dozens brought against President Donald Trump’s second administration over deep cuts to the federal workforce and funding, sweeping arrests and deportations of immigrants, Musk’s access to Americans’ sensitive data, and press access in the White House.Trump and Musk have repeatedly criticized federal judges who have ruled unfavorably, even calling for their impeachment.Republicans have assumed the mantle on the issue, criticizing wide-reaching injunctions from U.S. district courts.“Although our Founders saw an important role for the judiciary, they didn’t design a system that made judges national policymakers,” Iowa Sen. Chuck Grassley, chair of the Senate Committee on the Judiciary, said in his opening statement at a hearing Wednesday.The Democratic attorneys general who brought the lawsuit against the federal agencies had requested a nationwide injunction, arguing the mass firings were illegal and harmed states financially, but Bredar only applied the order to the plaintiffs’ jurisdictions.Bredar has previously issued a temporary emergency order mandating agencies reinstate employment for all 24,418 fired probationary workers, according to government figures, but expressed reluctance at a March 26 hearing to extend his order nationwide. The breakdown of fired probationary employees by state is unclear and the total number could be from the states involved in the lawsuit or other states or both.Departments and agencies named as defendants in the lawsuit must now return the probationary workers’ jobs to status quo by 2 p.m. Eastern on April 8, Bredar ordered. The agencies also “shall not conduct any future reductions in force (“RIFs”) — whether formally labeled as such or not” involving the affected probationary employees unless the process follows the law, Bredar wrote.The enjoined defendants include:The departments of Agriculture, Commerce, Defense (civilian employees only), Education, Energy, Health and Human Services, Homeland Security, Housing and Urban Development, Interior, Labor, Transportation, Treasury and Veterans Affairs, as well as the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, Environmental Protection Agency, Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, General Services Administration, Office of Personnel Management, Small Business Administration and the U.S. Agency for International Development.The order will remain in place while the case is pending.The states allege the mass firings led by Trump and Musk harmed them because the federal government did not provide the legally required advance notice that gives states time to prepare “rapid response activities” — including unemployment and social services — ahead of an influx of unemployed residents.Bredar highlighted in a memorandum opinion accompanying his order Tuesday that 31 states did not join the lawsuit, writing that nationwide injunctions are required in “rare” instances, and that “this case is not one of them.”“The Court’s injunction is not national in scope because it is possible to substantially stop the harms inflicted on the states that did sue without extending judicial authority over those that didn’t,” Bredar wrote.",,,,2025-04-02 12:09:45.662095

It passed after the Alabama House Ways and Means Education Committee delayed it last month due to concerns about how the benefit in the bill compares to the existing benefit for state employees. Rep. David Faulkner, R-Mountain Brook, said he worked with the sponsor and lawyers while the Legislature was on break last week.
“I made it very clear I am in 100% support of this bill and of workers’ comp for teachers,” he said. “There were just a couple of tweaks that needed to be made.”
Faulkner’s main concern was the appeals process for educators when they are injured on the job. In an amendment, Faulkner said the biggest change was spelling out the appeals process in the bill instead of referencing a part of the Alabama code. 
“We have that in the bill, the exact process, so people can see what the appeals process looks like,” Faulkner said.
The amendment was adopted unanimously.
Rep. Cynthia Almond, R-Tuscaloosa, who carried the bill for Givhan in committee, said they had been “working through those (questions) and maybe all of these questions have been answered.” 
Rep. Danny Garrett, R-Trussville, the chair of the committee, said last month the bill needed more work. On Wednesday, Garrett said he was pleased with the changes.
“Thank you again for all the work you guys have done on the break,” Garrett said.
The bill moves to the full House.

Laura Kelly don't appear to be on the same page in terms of the new state budget adopted by the House and Senate. The package could leave state government in the red by $461 million within three years based on current revenue estimates and proposed spending. Nine months into the fiscal year, Kansas has taken in $165 million more in tax revenue that predicted in November. (Sherman Smith/Kansas Reflector)TOPEKA — Substantive income and sales tax reform in Kansas continued during March to carve new channels in the state revenue stream, officials said.
Adjustments to state retail sales tax policy by ending application of a 6.5% sales tax on grocery items contributed to a $89 million decline in collections during the first three quarters of the fiscal year compared to this point in the previous fiscal year. The sales tax, and associated compensating use tax, has delivered $2.6 billion to the state during the fiscal year starting July 1.
The Legislature and Gov. Laura Kelly agreed last year to eliminate a personal income tax bracket and lower the highest individual income rate to 4.58% retroactive to Jan. 1, 2024. That was combined with a reduction in the state’s corporate income tax rate from 4% to 3.5% effective Jan. 1, 2024.
The Kansas Department of Revenue reported the state took in $88 million less year-to-date in corporate income taxes than at this juncture one year ago. That decline exceeded projections of state analysts by more than $11 million.
Shrinkage in corporate income tax collections has been eclipsed, however, by the surprise $200 million increase in individual income tax collections through March compared to the previous year. State analysts underestimated growth in individual income tax revenue by $187 million.
Three-fourths into the fiscal year, Kansas state government was more than $110 million up in terms of corporate and individual income tax revenue.
Overall, the Department of Revenue said Kansas received $6.9 billion in revenue from all tax sources in the current fiscal year. That represented a $47 million, or 0.7%, increase from the previous fiscal year. Kansas has taken in $165 million more in tax revenue through the initial nine months of the fiscal year than predicted by state financial analysts.
The consensus revenue group, comprised of individuals from the Department of Revenue, Kansas Department of Administration, Kansas Legislative Research Department as well as economists from University of Kansas, Kansas State University and Wichita State University, scheduled a meeting April 17 to evaluate economic conditions and make changes to state revenue projections.
The Legislature sent the governor last week a new state budget that could put Kansas in a $461 million budget hole within three years.
On KCUR’s Up To Date program Monday, Kelly said she was apprehensive about the Republican-led Legislature’s spending plan and compared it to the approach taken by Gov. Sam Brownback more than a decade ago when income taxes were aggressively slashed. The result was a five-year calamity that prompted state budget cuts and an increase in the statewide sales tax. The Legislature repealed, over Brownback’s objection, much of his tax program in 2017.
“With the budget they’ve passed, we will be way underwater,” Kelly told KCUR.
The governor said the Legislature could modify the budget legislation when it reconvened April 10 or gather for a special session after new state revenue estimates were released.
Kelly vetoed a bill Monday that would have left in place the previous year’s state budget if the Legislature and governor failed to agree on a budget deal.
She said she wouldn’t sanction Senate Bill 14 because it could freeze the budget in a manner not contemplated “through periods of war, famine, pandemic, recession, the Dust Bowl and even the Great Depression.”
House Speaker Dan Hawkins, R-Wichita, and Senate President Ty Masterson, R-Andover, said they planned to rally votes necessary to override Kelly’s veto of SB14. The GOP holds supermajorities in the House and Senate, meaning a veto by the governor could be overridden by Republicans alone.",https://kansasreflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/P4251473-1024x576.jpg,,,2025-04-02 12:09:45.662095

Some estimates have pegged the damages and economic losses from the fires at more than $250 billion. “We’ve had disaster after disaster after disaster,” said Assemblymember Dawn Addis, a Democrat.

(Mario Tama/Getty Images)For many California residents, the Los Angeles wildfires earlier this year were the latest and most searing example of the devastating effects of climate change. Some estimates have pegged the damages and economic losses from the fires at more than $250 billion.
“We’ve had disaster after disaster after disaster,” said Assemblymember Dawn Addis, a Democrat. “It’s the taxpayers and the insurance ratepayers that are bearing the cost. It’s not sustainable, it’s not right and it’s not ethical.”
Addis and Democratic lawmakers in nearly a dozen other states want to force the world’s largest fossil fuel companies to help pay for the recovery costs of climate-related disasters. Last year, Vermont became the first state to pass a “climate Superfund” law, followed soon after by New York.
This session, 10 states have seen similar proposals, several of which have advanced in key committees. Advocates point to legislation in Maryland that has drawn support in both chambers, as well as to strong grassroots support in California after the Los Angeles wildfires.
Lawmakers say the rapidly increasing cost of climate disasters — from wildfires to floods to sea level rise — is more than state budgets can bear.
“Climate Superfund is the ‘it girl’ policy of the [2025] session,” said Ava Gallo, climate and energy program manager with the National Caucus of Environmental Legislators, a forum for state lawmakers. “There’s a lot of popularity in the idea of holding polluters responsible.”
The momentum for these “polluter pays” bills is tied to the maturation of attribution science. That new field of research can help calculate fossil fuel companies’ contributions to historic emissions totals, as well as the role climate change played in causing or worsening natural disasters.
Vermont’s law was the first attempt to use that science to charge emitters for their role in causing devastating floods and other catastrophes.
Fossil fuel companies and their allies have fought back hard. Late last year, the American Petroleum Institute and the U.S. Chamber of Commerce filed a lawsuit challenging Vermont’s measure. The groups argue that emissions are governed by the federal Clean Air Act, precluding states from charging companies over global pollution.
Neither group responded to a Stateline interview request. The Independent Petroleum Association of America also declined an interview request.
A separate lawsuit, led by 22 Republican attorneys general, is challenging the New York law. And a conservative group has targeted Rachel Rothschild, an assistant professor of law at the University of Michigan Law School, who helped draft the legal justification for climate Superfund policy. The group, Government Accountability and Oversight, has sought to subject Rothschild to a deposition, The New York Times reported, a move that some experts view as an intimidation tactic.
Meanwhile, oil and gas executives asked President Donald Trump during a White House meeting this month to direct the Justice Department to join the legal fight against climate Superfund laws, The Wall Street Journal reported. Industry leaders are also pushing Congress to shield them from more than 30 lawsuits brought by state and local governments that aim to make them pay for some of the results of climate change.
While experts expect a bruising legal battle over climate Superfund policies, the threat of lawsuits hasn’t deterred more lawmakers from backing the concept.
“States were a little bit wary; they wondered, ‘Is this some new radical plan?’” said Cassidy DiPaola, communications director with the Make Polluters Pay campaign, a coalition of groups backing such bills. “Then one of the littlest states passed it and this powerhouse, New York, passed it. That really set the ball rolling.”
Fossil fuel companies have cast doubt on attribution science. They also note that their production of oil and other products was done legally under U.S. and international regulations.
“Manufacturers will see this as a shakedown of any industry you don’t like at some point in the future, even though in the past they were licensed and operated under government regulation,” Brett Vassey, president and CEO of the Virginia Manufacturers Association, said during legislative testimony about a climate Superfund proposal in that state. “It will have a chilling effect on Virginia being able to grow its economy.”
Proponents of Superfund legislation point to legal settlements with large tobacco companies in the 1990s. Although those companies also sold their products legally, they were held responsible because they knew about the harmful effects of those products and deceived the public. Most climate Superfund proposals target companies for their emissions over the past 30 or so years, after leading experts had documented the dangers of greenhouse gases.
“There’s good documentation of how well the fossil fuel industry knew the probable long-term impacts of their product,” said Oregon state Sen. Jeff Golden, a Democrat. “Should an industry that made such historic profits over a period of time and made so many representations that we had no problem not bear any of the costs?”
Golden and other lawmakers say it’s becoming impossible for taxpayers to cover the costs of recovery from wildfires and other catastrophes. In Rhode Island, sea level rise is causing massive damage for coastal communities, said Democratic state Rep. Jennifer Boylan, who has sponsored a climate Superfund bill to help the state adapt.
Some advocates also note that Trump’s return to the White House has cut off the possibility of federal climate relief.
“All the states are affected by the disappearance of this federal funding,” said Gallo, of the state lawmakers group. “States everywhere are going to be looking at some way to fill the gap.”
This session, climate Superfund bills have been introduced in California, Connecticut, Hawaii, Maryland, Massachusetts, New Jersey, Oregon, Rhode Island, Tennessee and Virginia.
While the bills are structured differently, they all seek to target the largest polluters — often covering companies that produced 1 billion metric tons of emissions over the last 30 or so years. Lawmakers say that applies to roughly 100 companies.
The measures also take different approaches to assigning damages. Some direct state agencies to conduct complex studies to determine the costs of climate-caused disasters over a certain period, the approach pioneered by Vermont. Others set a fixed number that represents a conservative baseline for those damages. New York’s law set that figure at $75 billion over a 25-year period.
Many of the bills also require that significant amounts of the funding be directed to the communities hit hardest by pollution.
Advocates are particularly optimistic about the measures in California and Maryland.
Lawmakers in Maryland modified their bills to commission a study about the financial impacts of climate change. Those measures passed both the House and Senate, and legislators are working to reconcile the versions from each chamber. Figures produced by the study would be the backbone of a climate Superfund policy in a future session.
“From a legislative perspective, it’s a shot in the dark as to what the costs are,” said Democratic Del. David Fraser-Hidalgo, who sponsored one of the bills. “This will give us the factual data needed to make a more well-educated decision on policy.”
In New Jersey, an Assembly committee advanced a climate Superfund bill this month. State Sen. Bob Smith, a Democrat who chairs the Environment and Energy Committee and who sponsored the bill, said it will help to rebuild and fortify water treatment plants, schools and firehouses. He noted that Trump has called for the dismantling of the Federal Emergency Management Agency.
“The end of the world is coming; it’s kind of hard to ignore,” Smith said. “FEMA has been the backstop to help communities recover from disasters. If the handwriting isn’t on the wall to all the states that they’ve got to deal with this, shame on them.”
Lawmakers in many states have heard from mayors and other local government leaders that more climate recovery funding is essential.
“Municipal officials are getting behind [climate Superfund policies],” said Massachusetts state Sen. Jamie Eldridge, a Democrat who has sponsored similar legislation. “They’re facing the costs of flooding, of droughts, of heat waves, and really asking for relief.”

(Photo courtesy U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service)Conservation efforts targeted at the Mexican gray wolf have shown positive results, according to recent studies, but last weekend’s death of a female wolf has been called “tragic” by experts and advocates.
The death of wandering wolf “Ella” was reported over the weekend by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service after she was spotted last week near Mount Taylor, close to Grants above Interstate 40. She had wandered outside of the Marquez Wildlife Area —  a protected area that covers about 15,000 acres in McKinley and Sandoval counties and where wolves are encouraged to remain. Interstate 40 is the northern boundary. The area is part of the Mexican Wolf Experimental Population Area that encompasses parts of New Mexico and Arizona and where wolves are released into the wild to repopulate.
The wildlife service reported that her body was found on Sunday and told Source NM that her death is under investigation, as is protocol for every known deceased wolf. Due to the investigation, a spokesperson for the wildlife service said they are not releasing details about the wolf’s cause of death or the exact location she was found.
Ella was a member of the Sawtooth pack in New Mexico, according to Aislinn Maestas, public affairs specialist for the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, who added that “every Mexican wolf in the wild contributed to recovery of the subspecies,” further emphasizing the disappointment conservationists have voiced over Ella’s death.
She was one of about 160 Mexican gray wolves living in the wild in New Mexico, according to a recent census.
“Ella’s death is a profound loss—not just for her species, but for all of us who saw in her journey a glimpse of what recovery could look like,” Claire Musser, executive director of the Grand Canyon Wolf Recovery Project, said in a statement. “She was young, instinct-driven, and full of possibility. By venturing north, she was reclaiming space that wolves once called home. Her story deserves more than mourning—it demands action to ensure other wolves have the freedom to thrive where she could not.”
Sally Paez, staff attorney for New Mexico Wild, told Source NM that she understood Ella was relatively young and around the age where she would be looking for a mate to establish her own pack, adding to the impact of her death. She said Ella was particularly interesting because she wandered outside of the Marquez Wildlife Area.
“Research has shown, and just common sense and experience — traveling around other parts of New Mexico and then Northern Arizona and Southern Colorado — there’s other places that are really suitable wolf habitat where we don’t currently have wolf populations,” Paez told Source NM. “This is a wolf who, I think, was traveling through areas that could provide good wildlife corridors.”
Paez said the Mount Taylor area provides a good area for wolves because of its “wild ecosystem,” elk herds and restoration work.
“I think it was really exciting that she was already drawn to a place that we know is good habitat and where we’d like to see wolf populations thrive,” Paez said. 
According to a December 2024 report from the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, a five-year evaluation of the Mexican wolf population showed growth surpassing experts’ targets.
Maestas added that the Mexican wolf population has had nine years of growth and there is an estimated minimum 286 wolves in the wild, including New Mexico and surrounding states. 
“Genetic management efforts are showing results,” Maestas told Source in an email. “These achievements are cause for celebration and give hope that recovery of the Mexican wolf is not only possible, but on the horizon.”

Cory Booker's 25-hour-plus speech broke a record previously held by a South Carolina senator who tried to prevent passage of the Civil Rights Act. (John Partipilo)

U.S. Sen. Cory Booker broke the record for longest floor speech in the history of the Senate on Tuesday, surpassing the 24-hour and 18-minute record set in 1957 when South Carolina’s Strom Thurmond attempted to prevent passage of the Civil Rights Act.
Booker, a Democrat who began his remarks Monday at 7 p.m. saying he wanted to highlight President Donald Trump’s “complete disregard for the rule of law,” by Tuesday at 7:20 p.m. was raspy-voiced, occasionally teary-eyed, and wearing what he called a “ripe” shirt.
It was New York Sen. Chuck Schumer, the Senate’s Democratic leader, who interrupted Booker to say he had broken Thurmond’s record.
“Do you know how proud this caucus is of you? Do you know how proud America is of you?” Schumer said to applause and a standing ovation from his fellow Democrats and visitors.

This story originally appeared in The New Jersey Monitor

Booker noted that Thurmond with his 1957 filibuster “tried to stop the rights upon which I stand.”
“I’m not here, though, because of his speech. I’m here despite his speech. I’m here because, as powerful as he was, the people were more powerful,” Booker said.
Wyoming Sen. Cynthia Lummis was one of just two Republican lawmakers in the chamber at the time. Lummis joined Democrats in celebrating Booker’s accomplishment by standing and clapping.
Guests and staff are normally barred from any displays of support or disapproval while sitting in the gallery, but Utah Sen. John Curtis, a Republican who was presiding over the chamber, allowed it.
Booker finally yielded the floor a few minutes after 8 p.m. Tuesday.
Booker’s record-breaking speech comes as the Democratic Party faces criticism from voters who say the party’s leaders are not doing enough to stand up to Trump’s actions, especially those that experts say fly in the face of legal precedent.
“These are not normal times in our nation, and they should not be treated as such in the United States Senate,” Booker said at one point. “The threats to the American people and American democracy are grave and urgent, and we all must do more to stand against them.”
The senator covered a breadth of topics: health care, Social Security, Medicaid, grocery prices, free speech, veterans, public education, world leaders, Elon Musk’s Department of Government Efficiency, and national security concerns. He read letters and comments from constituents and he quoted speeches from the late Rep. John Lewis — invoking Lewis’ famous call to action to “get in good trouble” — and the late Sen. John McCain.
“This is not right or left. It is right or wrong. This is not a partisan moment. It is a moral moment,” Booker said. “Where do you stand?”
Booker, 55, a former mayor of Newark, also assailed Trump’s policies on immigration. He said the Trump administration is doing “outrageous things like disappearing people off of American streets, violating fundamental principles of this document” — here he held up a copy of the U.S. Constitution — “invoking the Alien Enemies Act from the 1700s that was last used to put Japanese Americans into internment camps.”
“Do we see what’s happening?” Booker asked.
He spent about a half-hour reading the account of Jasmine Mooney, a Canadian citizen who was detained by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement for 12 days in March. He also noted that the Trump administration conceded Monday that it deported Kilmar Abrego Garcia, a 29-year-old Maryland man with protected legal status, to an El Salvador prison because of an “administrative error.”
“The government can’t walk up to a human being and grab them off the street and put them on a plane and send them to one of the most notorious prisons in the world, and just say, as one of our authorities did, ‘Oopsie,’” Booker said.

(University of Maine image)Three years after they began, negotiations over a proposed power contract for an offshore floating wind farm in the Gulf of Maine have come to an abrupt halt, with the developer citing “recent shifts in the energy landscape that have in particular caused uncertainty in the offshore wind industry.”
In a March 28 filing at the Public Utilities Commission, the PUC staff explained that Pine Tree Offshore Wind LLC has requested that the talks be temporarily suspended.
The request is not a total surprise, due to rising material costs worldwide and efforts by President Donald Trump to dismantle the nascent domestic industry. But it still represents a blow to Maine’s long-term efforts to position floating offshore wind as a major new source of clean energy and economic development.
Dan Burgess, director of the Governor’s Energy Office, said in an emailed statement that the office “understands and respects Pine Tree Offshore Wind’s request to pause negotiations for the state’s research array, in reflection of current uncertainty in the offshore wind industry.
Offshore wind, including the research array, is an important part of Maine’s long-term energy future, and GEO will continue to work on responsible offshore wind research and development to advance economic and environmental benefits for Maine.”
When asked specifically why it was putting talks on hold, Pine Tree Offshore Wind declined to comment and referred questions to the GEO.
Maine must deploy and test full-size versions of this platform design far offshore, in a so-called research array. After three years of negotiations, state regulators had been planning to decide by late March if a proposed contract for utilities to buy power from a 12-platform wind farm was in the public interest.
The proposed research array, 30 miles off Portland, was expected to be a critical stepping stone to a commercial-scale wind farm in the Gulf of Maine.
Maine is playing a long game on offshore wind. But its standing with global investors and developers could hinge on what happens with the test hull and research array contract over the next year or so.
Without the contract, Maine will lose its best chance to compete in floating offshore wind, according to Chris Wissemann, chief executive officer of Diamond Offshore Wind, which plans to build the array. Diamond is a subsidiary of Japan’s Mitsubishi Corp., and is part of related subsidiaries called New England Aqua Ventus LLC and Pine Tree Offshore Wind LLC. Diamond has invested $20 million so far pursuing that goal, he said.
“If the research array is not approved early this year,” Wissemann told The Maine Monitor last January, “Maine’s leadership in offshore wind is lost, I believe, probably forever. The industry will conclude that Maine won’t do anything. Too much time has gone on.”
Maine is not the only state facing headwinds on offshore wind development. Utility companies in Rhode Island and Massachusetts also announced this week that they would delay contract negotiations amidst federal uncertainty.
“This is a reaction to the uncertainty and hostility that’s coming from the federal government,” said Jack Shapiro, climate and clean energy director for the Natural Resources Council of Maine. “Nobody knows if they’re going to get any kind of permit at all.”
For supporters of offshore wind energy, the discouraging news regarding the research array contract was offset somewhat this week, following news that the University of Maine on Sunday had launched a second prototype of its patented floating wind turbine platform. Researchers put the 52-foot wide, quarter scale hull in the water at Bar Harbor, the Bangor Daily News reported. The platform will be towed to a test site off Castine.
It has been 12 years since UMaine tested a one-eighth scale version of the platform at the same location. Since then, the UMaine team has worked to refine the 380-ton concrete, semi-submersible design, which would be built at full scale when a 12-turbine research array is finally developed, now planned for sometime in the 2030s.

(Photo by Cami Koons/Iowa Capital Dispatch) The state could not take a person out of consideration for becoming a foster or adoptive parent based on their “sincerely held moral and religious beliefs” on gender identity and sexual orientation under a bill passed by a House subcommittee Wednesday.
While supporters of Senate File 473 said the measure would increase Iowa’s pool of prospective parents, others said the measure could put LGBTQ+ youth and families at risk for discrimination. The Iowa Department of Health and Human Services could not require a prospective foster or adoptive parent to accept policies that conflict with their moral and religious beliefs related to LGBTQ+ people in order to be eligible for licensing or to be an individual child’s caretaker.
The bill also states a person cannot be precluded as a choice for becoming a child’s foster or adoptive parent based on their beliefs including factors like “the person’s intent to guide, instruct, or raise a child in a manner consistent with the person’s sincerely held religious or moral beliefs.”
Matthew Tate-Smith, the parent of four adopted children and foster parent of 14 children alongside his partner, said families like his could face discrimination in the foster and adoption placement process for their gender identity or sexual orientation. But he said more importantly, the bill could put children in this system at risk.
“What’s especially alarming is that this bill could place LGBTQ foster kids with prospective parents who might want to engage in the debunked practice of so-called ‘conversion therapy,'” Tate-Smith said. “… These kids deserve supportive and affirming homes and families that will welcome them with open arms, instead of attempting to fundamentally change who they are. Simply put, this is not in the best interest of foster children.”
“Conversion therapy,” sometimes referred to as “reparative therapy,” are practices that attempt to change a person’s sexual orientation or gender identity and expression. Medical organizations have overwhelmingly found that these practices are unscientific and are not recommended for children’s behavioral health treatment, and a 2020 study in the American Journal of Public Health found LGBTQ+ youth who were subject to conversion therapy were more likely to attempt suicide.
But advocates in favor of the bill said that the measure was needed to ensure that families with religious beliefs that do not affirm LGBTQ+ identities are not excluded from the pool of adoptive and foster parent applicants. Lance Kinzer with the 1st Amendment Partnership, a religious rights organization, said the measure was needed in light of policies in other states like Oregon where a prospective parent was denied certification after stating her religious beliefs would prevent her from they affirming a child’s gender identity or sexual orientation if they are transgender or attracted to the same gender.
Kinzer noted the Iowa legislation would still allow the department to take into account the “sincerely held moral and religious beliefs” related to LGBTQ+ identities of the child and their family of origin when determining the best placement for the child.
“What’s happening in other states is that people are being told not merely that they may not be the best placement for, say, a gender dysphoric 15-year-old, but because of their religious beliefs, they can’t foster any child, even a 15-year-old who attends their own congregation, who agrees with their religious beliefs,” Kinzer said.
Jim Florence, an adoptive parent of two children, said this issue is happening in Iowa, claiming he faced discrimination while going through the foster parent licensing process.
Florence said the discrimination occurred during the placement of two boys who they fostered that were adopted by a same-sex couple.  One of the children had told staff that “he wanted a mom and a dad, not two dads,” Florence said, and after he and his wife told the contracted organization and Iowa HHS that they believed the placement was not in the child’s best interest, he said they were “accused of forcing our religious beliefs on these children” and had their foster care license placed on hold.
He said the bill would prevent these situations from occurring in the future.
“The state’s responsibility is to consider a child’s beliefs and values when placing them in a foster or adoptive home,” Florence said. “As Christian parents, we try to protect these children’s Christian convictions. We advocated for the children’s rights to an adoptive home with similar beliefs and values to their own. Ultimately, the desires of the same-sex couple were given preference. Not only were we discriminated against, the fundamental rights of a child were ignored.”
The bill moved forward with support from Reps. Steven Holt, R-Denison, and Craig Williams, R-Manning. Holt reiterated the bill would take into consideration the beliefs of the child and family of origin when making a foster or adoptive care placement.
“This is removing the viewpoint of discrimination that currently exists against people of faith,” Holt said. “I think it is protective of both sides of the equation.”
Rep. Beth Wessel-Kroeschell, D-Ames, opposed the bill, saying that it was essential for children to be placed with families that will provide support regardless of their identity.
“Foster children are children in crisis, and their needs have to be put first,” Wessel-Kroeschell said. “Children must be in environments that have affirming care, and not somebody who’s trying to change them, but to help them.”
The bill, which passed the Iowa Senate 35-14, moves to the House Judiciary Committee for further consideration.",https://iowacapitaldispatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/capitol-dome.jpg,,,2025-04-02 11:10:24.718005

Gretchen Whitmer discusses the Fiscal Year 2025 Education Budget at Educare in Flint. | Kyle DavidsonFollowing a string of ice storms which tore through the northern Lower Peninsula over the weekend, Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer is expanding her initial state of emergency and deploying the Michigan National Guard to help clear roadways and areas overcome by debris. 
On Monday afternoon, Whitmer declared a state of emergency in for Otsego, Oscoda, Montmorency, Presque Isle, Emmet, Charlevoix, Cheboygan, Crawford, Mackinac and Alpena counties, expanding the declaration to include Alcona and Antrim counties on Tuesday.
By declaring a state of emergency, Whitmer has made all state resources available in cooperation with local response and recovery efforts in the area of emergency. It also authorizes the Michigan State Police, Emergency Management and Homeland Security Division to further coordinate state efforts, following the governor’s activation of the State Emergency Operations Center on Sunday. 
In addition to the two teams assigned to clear debris, the Michigan National Guard has responded to a request from the MyMichigan Medical Center in Alpena to stand up a temporary shelter to support emergency room overflow. 
With many counties experiencing widespread power outages and fuel shortages, Whitmer’s office said temporary fuel depots are necessary. Signing an executive order, Whitmer has temporarily suspended restrictions on commercial driver hours as well as seasonal load restrictions to ensure there is a consistent flow of gasoline, distillate and propane alongside the transport of equipment to address transportation and supply needs.
According to a report from MLive, 90,000 homes and businesses were left without power at the storm’s peak.
While Whitmer was initially scheduled to give an address in Washington D.C. on Thursday centered on American manufacturing and national defense, the governor has postponed her speech to remain in Michigan and coordinate emergency response efforts. 



The governor’s office also shared the following updates on resources for Michiganders impacted by the storms:

Utility crews are continuing to restore power to the impacted areas. 
The Mackinac Bridge is closed due to concerns about melting ice falling onto cars. The bridge will reopen once it is deemed safe by authorities.   
The Michigan Department of Transportation is working with county road commissions to clear state trunklines and secondary roads. 
Approximately 20 shelters have been stood up in the area which are being run by the Red Cross. Residents are encouraged to dial 211 for local information. 
Food is provided by the Salvation Army and local food banks at shelters. Residents are encouraged to dial 211 for local information. 
300 oxygen tanks are being delivered to Montmorency County with two oxygen refill stations sent to address concerns for residents. One refill tank will be at the Emergency Management Services building in Indian River, and another at the MyMichigan Medical Center in Alpena. Residents who require oxygen refills will need to come to the locations for assistance.  
Southern Baptist, Team Rubicon and World Renew Volunteer Organizations have been mobilized to assist with clean up.

House Bill 443 proposes asking North Carolinians to approve a constitutional amendment that would restrict the governor to a preselected list of candidates for Council of State vacancies determined by the political party of the departing official. This would apply to all Council of State officers with the exception of the lieutenant governor, for whom there is not a mechanism to appoint an interim replacement.
The bill’s requirements mirror those that the General Assembly created for interim state Supreme Court and Court of Appeals vacancies in Senate Bill 382, the Hurricane Helene relief bill that substantially shifted power away from elected offices held by Democrats passed shortly after Governor Josh Stein’s election.
Under those requirements too, Stein is required to pick from a predetermined list of three potential nominees selected by the previous judge’s political party — a restriction Stein is now suing to block, arguing that it violates the state constitution’s broad grant of authority to the governor to make appointments. The state similarly requires that interim U.S. Senators appointed by the governor are members of the same party as their predecessor.
Rep. Hugh Blackwell (R-Burke), presenting H.B. 443 in the absence of its lead sponsor, Rep. Kyle Hall (R-Forsyth), said this bill proposes a constitutional amendment instead of a statutory change in part to avoid the legislature changing the law for political advantage due to “particular circumstances.”
“It’s a transparent process for replacing people in that you can see who was recommended to the governor and the governor picks from from that group of individuals,” Hall said. “It would maintain at least until the next election, the party affiliation, if you will, of the person that the voters last chose for the office.”
Mark Swallow, a representative with Democracy Out Loud, raised concerns about the bill in public comment, arguing that the state’s constitution should be “more apolitical than political.”
“In considering this as something that’s going to be put into our constitution, our North Carolina constitution, it seems like there should be a very deliberate, very bipartisan type of action,” Swallow said. “We would think this is more of a statute or a bill than a constitutional amendment.”
Gambling proposal draws opposition
More contentious was the debate over House Bill 424, which would legalize betting on card, tile, and dice games in some private spaces such as residences and community clubhouses.
Multiple representatives as well as John Rustin, president of the North Carolina Family Policy Council, raised concerns that ambiguity in the bill could expand the scope of legal gambling far more than intended, warning that private enterprises may try to take advantage of loopholes to run what are essentially casinos.
Due to the contention around the bill, members on the panel proceeded to a voice vote, ultimately giving it a favorable recommendation by a 7-3 vote. The constitutional amendment proposal passed by voice vote. HB 443 will proceed to the Committee on State and Local Government for further discussion, while HB 424 now heads to the House Rules committee.",https://ncnewsline.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/NC_Legislature_PhotoChenkel-1024x720.jpg,,,2025-04-02 11:10:24.718005

(Photo by Baylor Spears/Wisconsin Examiner)Dane County Judge Susan Crawford was elected to the Wisconsin Supreme Court Tuesday, solidifying liberal control of the body until 2028 and marking a sharp rebuke by the state’s voters of the policies of President Donald Trump and the financial might of his most prominent adviser, Elon Musk.
Crawford rode massive turnout in Dane and Milwaukee counties and outperformed Kamala Harris’ effort last year in a number of other parts of the state to defeat her opponent, Waukesha County Judge Brad Schimel by about 11 points.
The former chief legal counsel for Democratic Gov. Jim Doyle who represented liberal groups such as Planned Parenthood and the Madison teacher’s union as a private practice attorney said during the campaign that she would look out for the rights of all Wisconsinites on the Supreme Court while repeatedly criticizing Schimel for his eagerness to show his support for Trump, his record as attorney general and the outside assistance his campaign got from Musk.
Crawford’s victory marks the third straight Supreme Court election for Wisconsin’s liberals and maintains the 4-3 liberal majority that has been in place since Justice Janet Protasiewicz was elected in 2023. Crawford will replace retiring Justice Ann Walsh Bradley.
Since gaining control of the Court, the new liberal majority has ruled that the state’s previous legislative maps were unconstitutional, ending the partisan gerrymander that had locked in Republican control of the Legislature for more than a decade, and accepted cases that will decide the rights of Wisconsinites to have an abortion. The Court is also likely to consider a challenge to Wisconsin’s 2011 law stripping most union rights from public employees within the next year or two.
“I’m here tonight because I’ve spent my life fighting to do what’s right,” Crawford said after the race was called for her. “That’s why I got into this race, to protect the fundamental rights and freedoms of all.”
Schimel said he got into the race because he was opposed to the “partisanship” of the liberal controlled Court but his effort to nationalize the race and show his support for Trump proved unsuccessful against a backlash to the second Trump term and voters’ distrust of Musk, who offered cash incentives for people who got out the vote for Schimel.
Tuesday’s election was the first statewide race in the country since Trump won the presidency last fall. Trump narrowly won Wisconsin and in counties across the state, Schimel failed to match the president’s vote total. In La Crosse County, Crawford performed 11 points better than Harris did last year and Schimel didn’t even match Trump’s vote share in his home of Waukesha County.
Schimel ran nearly even with former Supreme Court Justice Dan Kelly, who lost to Protasiewicz in the 2023 race. Wisconsin’s conservatives have now lost the past three Supreme Court elections by double digits.
The 2025 Wisconsin Supreme Court race set the record for the most expensive judicial campaign in U.S. history, topping the $100 million mark. While Crawford received support from liberal billionaires including George Soros and Illinois Gov. J.B. Pritzker, Musk dwarfed all other contributors, dumping more than $20 million into the race.

Musk’s money helped blanket the state’s airwaves with attack ads against Crawford’s record as a judge, often criticizing sentences she gave to people convicted of sexual violence. A Musk-associated PAC also hired people to knock on thousands of doors in an effort to turn out Trump’s base of Wisconsin voters, who have often sat out non-presidential elections. America PAC, a political action committee associated with Musk, paid door knockers $25 an hour, offered voters cash if they filled out a petition against “activist judges” and gave two people $1 million checks at a rally on Sunday.
“But I’ve got to tell you, as a little girl growing up in Chippewa Falls, I never could have imagined that I’d be taking on the richest man in the world  for justice in Wisconsin,” Crawford said. “And we won.”
In a concession speech delivered shortly before 9:30 p.m., Schimel told supporters they “didn’t leave anything on the field,” and when a few began to complain said “no, we’ve gotta accept this.”
“The numbers aren’t going to turn around. Too bad. We’re not going to pull this off,” he said. “So thank you guys. From the bottom of my heart. God bless you. God bless the state of Wisconsin. God bless America. You will rise again. We’ll get up to fight another day, it just wasn’t our day.”
The Democratic Party of Wisconsin, harnessing voters’ alarm at the actions Musk has been leading from his federal DOGE office to cut government programs and fire thousands of public employees, held People v. Musk town halls across the state where residents said they were worried about the effect those cuts would have on services they rely on like Medicaid, Social Security, veteran’s benefits and education funding.
Gov. Tony Evers said that Wisconsin “felt the weight of America” in this election, which proved Wisconsinites “will not be bought.”
“This election was about the resilience of the Wisconsin and American values that define and unite us,” Evers said. “This election was about doing what’s best for our kids, protecting constitutional checks and balances, reaffirming our faith in the courts and the judiciary, and defending against attacks on the basic rights, freedoms, and institutions we hold dear. But above all, this election was as much about who Wisconsinites believe we can be as it was about the country we believe we must be.”
Democrats and Crawford accused Musk of trying to buy a seat on the state Supreme Court, partially to influence a lawsuit his company, Tesla, has filed challenging a Wisconsin law that prohibits car manufacturers from selling directly to consumers. Musk said he was focused on the race because the Court could decide the constitutionality of the state’s congressional maps, which currently favor Republicans and help the party hold a narrow majority in the U.S. House of Representatives.
At the victory party, Democratic Party of Wisconsin Chair Ben Wikler compared the effort against Musk and Trump to Gov. Robert “Fighting Bob” La Follette’s fight against the oligarchs of the early 20th century, adding that Republicans’ association with Musk will be an “anchor.”
“I think what Susan Crawford did by making clear that Elon Musk was the real opponent in this race, what voters did by responding to Elon Musk, it made clear that Elon Musk is politically toxic, and he is a massive anchor that will drag Republicans from the bottom of the ocean,” he said. “And that’s a message that I hope Republicans in Washington hear as fast as possible. Not only will they lose, but they will deserve to lose resoundingly and they will be swept out of power in a wave of outrage across the nation.”
On the campaign trail, Crawford sought to tie Schimel to Musk — she called her opponent “Elon Schimel” at the only debate between the two candidates — while portraying herself as the less partisan candidate. Throughout the nominally non-partisan race, both candidates lobbed accusations of extreme political views at the other.
With Crawford’s victory and the retention of the Court’s liberal majority, the body is expected to rule on cases that ask if Wisconsin’s Constitution grants women the right to access an abortion, the legality of the Republican-authored law that restricts the collective bargaining rights of most public employees, how Wisconsin’s industries should be regulated for pollution and the legality of the state’s congressional maps.
Heather Williams, a spokesperson for the Democratic Legislative Campaign Committee, said in a statement that Democrats were offering a better vision for the country than the one promised by Schimel, Trump and Musk.
“Despite Republicans’ best efforts to buy this seat, Wisconsin voters showed up for their values and future,” Williams said. “While Trump dismantles programs that taxpayers have earned, support, and are counting on, voters across the country are turning to state Democrats who are delivering on promises to lower costs and expand opportunities.”

“This election was about the resilience of the Wisconsin and American values that define and unite us,” Evers said. “This election was about doing what’s best for our kids, protecting constitutional checks and balances, reaffirming our faith in the courts and the judiciary, and defending against attacks on the basic rights, freedoms, and institutions we hold dear. But above all, this election was as much about who Wisconsinites believe we can be as it was about the country we believe we must be.”
Democrats and Crawford accused Musk of trying to buy a seat on the state Supreme Court, partially to influence a lawsuit his company, Tesla, has filed challenging a Wisconsin law that prohibits car manufacturers from selling directly to consumers. Musk said he was focused on the race because the Court could decide the constitutionality of the state’s congressional maps, which currently favor Republicans and help the party hold a narrow majority in the U.S. House of Representatives.
At the victory party, Democratic Party of Wisconsin Chair Ben Wikler compared the effort against Musk and Trump to Gov. Robert “Fighting Bob” La Follette’s fight against the oligarchs of the early 20th century, adding that Republicans’ association with Musk will be an “anchor.”
“I think what Susan Crawford did by making clear that Elon Musk was the real opponent in this race, what voters did by responding to Elon Musk, it made clear that Elon Musk is politically toxic, and he is a massive anchor that will drag Republicans from the bottom of the ocean,” he said. “And that’s a message that I hope Republicans in Washington hear as fast as possible. Not only will they lose, but they will deserve to lose resoundingly and they will be swept out of power in a wave of outrage across the nation.”
On the campaign trail, Crawford sought to tie Schimel to Musk — she called her opponent “Elon Schimel” at the only debate between the two candidates — while portraying herself as the less partisan candidate. Throughout the nominally non-partisan race, both candidates lobbed accusations of extreme political views at the other.
With Crawford’s victory and the retention of the Court’s liberal majority, the body is expected to rule on cases that ask if Wisconsin’s Constitution grants women the right to access an abortion, the legality of the Republican-authored law that restricts the collective bargaining rights of most public employees, how Wisconsin’s industries should be regulated for pollution and the legality of the state’s congressional maps.
Heather Williams, a spokesperson for the Democratic Legislative Campaign Committee, said in a statement that Democrats were offering a better vision for the country than the one promised by Schimel, Trump and Musk.
“Despite Republicans’ best efforts to buy this seat, Wisconsin voters showed up for their values and future,” Williams said. “While Trump dismantles programs that taxpayers have earned, support, and are counting on, voters across the country are turning to state Democrats who are delivering on promises to lower costs and expand opportunities.”

(Maya Smith for Kansas Reflector)LAWRENCE — Autumn Bertels is an accomplished, wheelchair-mobile biology student at the University of Kansas who will graduate this May.
But after requesting accommodations for a chemistry lab due to lab tables being too tall, she was met with delays and excuses. She could only fully participate in one of 11 labs during the semester.
Now, Bertels is the 2025 Ms. Wheelchair Kansas titleholder, which will allow her to advocate for the wheelchair community and educate others throughout the state about accessibility in higher education. 
“Everyone has the right to equal opportunity, quality and access of education, and there are so many ways that we can do this,” Bertels said. “Everyone has a right to education, and you shouldn’t have to be a disabled person to combat these challenges.”
Ms. Wheelchair Kansas has uplifted women like Bertels for 20 years with a contest to select the most well-rounded, confident and wheelchair-mobile contestant to serve as a statewide role model. The organization’s mission is to provide the opportunity to compete in a pageant regardless of disability. 
CEO and 2004 titleholder Carrie Greenwood says this was the ultimate goal in bringing the contest to Kansas.
“We got here one year and one title holder at a time,” Greenwood said. “I had no idea that it would last this long and that it would really become my passion. Or that we would impact so many people in our state. It’s worth it to empower all the ladies who are here.”

The contest has grown steadily each year. Thirty-eight women have competed for the adult title, with winners making more than 500 appearances in more than 65 cities across Kansas. They added the Little Miss title in 2015 and the Junior Miss title this year. Most recently, 2024 titleholder Tamara Blackwell became the first Kansan to win the national title.
“I have had the privilege to sit in rooms and be before people that I have never thought I would,” Blackwell said. “I am so elated because that’s been able to push Ms. Wheelchair Kansas in the spotlight, and I hope that it helps only shine a brighter light to show the beauty that lies within the community. That we are intelligent, that we are equipped, that we may be in chairs, we may be different, but there’s nothing wrong with being different. And I just love that.”
Bertels said she wants to use her platform to cultivate better accessibility and education about disabilities at other college campuses in the state. She will also serve as a mentor for the two younger titleholders and compete at the national level in August.
“We live in a time where accommodations aren’t readily available to those who need them,” she said. “My Little Miss is also focusing on education as well, which is really great for both of us to work on.”
Isabel Einwich, Junior Miss 2025, was motivated to advocate for better awareness in education for those with disabilities. She says it took a broken elevator for her school administrators to realize they didn’t have an emergency plan for students in wheelchairs.
“It shouldn’t have to take a broken elevator to raise these questions. I hope to continue sharing my story and having opportunities to bring more attention to school issues surrounding disabilities through education,” Einwich said. “I just hope we can get to a point where we hear much less of that phrase, “Oh, we didn’t think about that.’ ”
Everyone involved — whether contestants, parents or volunteers — agree that the community has driven the organization’s growth and success. Greenwood believes these contestants are essential to the broader Kansas community.
“I ask everyone and anyone to get involved in this organization. It shows the value of diversity and working for a common purpose,” Greenwood said. “When you put your heart into something it will always succeed. And our title holders, they are what’s made this organization a success. They are the backbone of what we do, and they represent women and young girls who are wheelchair mobile so well.”",https://kansasreflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/DSC_0334-1024x681.jpg,,,2025-04-02 10:06:41.272891

Medicare Advantage plans pay hospitals lower rates than traditional Medicare, said Jason Merkley, CEO of Brookings [&#8230;]","Jason Merkley, CEO of Brookings Health System in rural South Dakota, says private Medicare plans jeopardized the company's finances while impeding patient care. So last year, Brookings dropped four contracts it had with Medicare Advantage companies. (Robb Long for KFF Health News)Rural hospital leaders are questioning whether they can continue to afford to do business with Medicare Advantage companies, and some say the only way to maintain services and protect patients is to end their contracts with the private insurers.
Medicare Advantage plans pay hospitals lower rates than traditional Medicare, said Jason Merkley, CEO of Brookings Health System in South Dakota. Merkley worried the losses would spark staff layoffs and cuts to patient services. So last year, Brookings Health dropped all four contracts it had with major Medicare Advantage companies.
“I’ve had lots of discussions with CEOs and executive teams across the country in regard to that,” said Merkley, whose health system operates a hospital and clinics in the small city of Brookings and surrounding rural areas.
Merkley and other rural hospital operators in recent years have enumerated a long list of concerns about the publicly funded, privately run health plans. In addition to the reimbursement issue, their complaints include payment delays and a resistance to authorizing patient care.
But rural hospitals abandoning their Medicare Advantage contracts can leave local patients without nearby in-network providers or force them to scramble to switch coverage.
Medicare is the main federal health insurance program for people 65 or older. Participants can enroll in traditional, government-run Medicare or in a Medicare Advantage plan run by a private insurance company.
In 2024, 56% of urban Medicare recipients were enrolled in a private plan, according to a report by the Medicare Payment Advisory Commission, a federal agency that advises Congress. While just 47% of rural recipients enrolled in a private plan, Medicare Advantage has expanded more quickly in rural areas.
In recent years, average Medicare Advantage reimbursements to rural hospitals were about 90% of what traditional Medicare paid, according to a new report from the American Hospital Association. And traditional Medicare already pays hospitals much less than private plans, according to a recent study by Rand Corp., a research nonprofit.
Carrie Cochran-McClain, chief policy officer at the National Rural Health Association, said Medicare Advantage is particularly challenging for small rural facilities designated critical access hospitals. Traditional Medicare pays such hospitals extra, but the private insurance companies aren’t required to do so.
“The vast majority of our rural hospitals are not in a position where they can take further cuts to payment,” Cochran-McClain said. “There are so many that are just really in a precarious financial spot.”
Nearly 200 rural hospitals have ended inpatient services or shuttered since 2005.
Mehmet Oz — doctor, former talk show host, and President Donald Trump’s nominee to lead the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services — has promoted and worked for the private Medicare industry and called for “Medicare Advantage for all.” But during his recent confirmation hearing, he called for more oversight as he acknowledged bipartisan concerns about the plans’ cost to taxpayers and their effect on patients.
Cochran-McClain said some Republican lawmakers want to address these issues while supporting Medicare Advantage.
“But I don’t think we’ve seen enough yet to really know what direction that’s all going to take,” she said.
Medicare Advantage plans can offer lower premiums and out-of-pocket costs for some participants. Nearly all offer extra benefits, such as vision, hearing, and dental coverage. Many also offer perks, such as gym memberships, nutrition services, and allowances for over-the-counter health supplies.
But a recent study in the Health Services Research journal found that rural patients on private plans struggled to access and afford care more often than rural enrollees on traditional Medicare and urban participants in both kinds of plans.
Susan Reilly, a spokesperson for the Better Medicare Alliance, said a recent report published by her group, which promotes Medicare Advantage, found that private plans are more affordable than traditional Medicare for rural beneficiaries. That analysis was conducted by an outside firm and based on a government survey of Medicare recipients.
Reilly also pointed to a study in The American Journal of Managed Care that found the growth of private plans in rural areas from 2008-2019 was associated with increased financial stability for hospitals and a reduced risk of closure.
Merkley said that’s not what he’s seeing on the ground in rural South Dakota.
He said traditional Medicare reimbursed Brookings Health System 91 cents for every dollar it spent on care in 2023, while Medicare Advantage plans paid 76 cents per dollar spent. He said his staff tried negotiating better contracts with the big Medicare Advantage companies, to no avail.
Patients who remain on private plans that no longer contract with their local hospitals and clinics may face higher prices unless they travel to in-network facilities, which in rural areas can be hours away. Merkley said most patients at Brookings Health switched to traditional Medicare or to regional Medicare Advantage plans that work better with the hospital system.
But switching from private to traditional Medicare can be unaffordable for patients.
That’s because in most states, Medigap plans — supplemental plans that help people on traditional Medicare cover out-of-pocket costs — can deny coverage or base their prices on patients’ medical history if they switch from a private plan.
Some rural health systems say they no longer work with any Medicare Advantage companies. They include Great Plains Health, which serves parts of rural Nebraska, Kansas, and Colorado, and Kimball Health Services, which is based in two small towns in Nebraska and Wyoming.
Medicare Advantage plans often limit the providers patients can see and require referrals and prior authorization for certain services. Requesting referrals, seeking preauthorization, and appealing denials can delay treatment for patients while adding extra work for doctors and billing staff.
“The unique rural lens on that is that rural providers really tend to be pretty bare-bone shops,” Cochran-McClain said. “That kind of administrative burden pulls people away from really being able to focus on providing quality care to their beneficiaries.”
Jonathon Green, CEO of Taylor Health Care Group in rural Georgia, said his system had to set up a team to deal solely with coverage denials, mostly from Medicare Advantage companies. He said some plans frequently decline to authorize payments before treatments, refuse to cover services they already approved, and deny payment for care that shouldn’t need approval.
In these cases, Green said, the companies argue that the care wasn’t appropriate for the patient.
“We hear that term constantly — ‘It’s not medically necessary,’” he said. “That’s the catchall for everything.”
Green said Taylor Health Care Group has considered dropping its Medicare Advantage contracts but is keeping them for now.
Cochran-McClain said her group supports policy changes, such as a federal bill that aims to streamline prior authorization while requiring Medicare Advantage companies to share data about the process. The 2024 bill was co-sponsored by more than half of U.S. senators, but needs to be reintroduced this year.
Cochran-McClain said rural-health advocates also want the government to require private plans to pay critical access hospitals and similar rural facilities as much as they would receive from traditional Medicare.
Green and Merkley stressed that they aren’t against the concept of private Medicare plans; they just want them to be fairer to rural facilities and patients.
Green said rural and independent hospitals don’t have the leverage that urban hospitals and large chains do in negotiations with giant Medicare Advantage companies.
“We just don’t have the ability to swing the pendulum enough,” he said.

Booker, a Democrat who began his remarks Monday at 7 p.m. saying he wanted to highlight President Donald Trump’s “complete disregard for the rule of law,” by Tuesday at 7:20 p.m. was raspy-voiced, occasionally teary-eyed, and wearing what he called a “ripe” shirt.
It was New York Sen. Chuck Schumer, the Senate’s Democratic leader, who interrupted Booker to say he had broken Thurmond’s record.
“Do you know how proud this caucus is of you? Do you know how proud America is of you?” Schumer said to applause and a standing ovation from his fellow Democrats and visitors.
Booker noted that Thurmond with his 1957 filibuster “tried to stop the rights upon which I stand.”
“I’m not here, though, because of his speech. I’m here despite his speech. I’m here because, as powerful as he was, the people were more powerful,” Booker said.
Wyoming Sen. Cynthia Lummis was one of just two Republican lawmakers in the chamber at the time. Lummis joined Democrats in celebrating Booker’s accomplishment by standing and clapping.
Guests and staff are normally barred from any displays of support or disapproval while sitting in the gallery, but Utah Sen. John Curtis, a Republican who was presiding over the chamber, allowed it.
Booker finally yielded the floor a few minutes after 8 p.m. Tuesday.
Booker’s record-breaking speech comes as the Democratic Party faces criticism from voters who say the party’s leaders are not doing enough to stand up to Trump’s actions, especially those that experts say fly in the face of legal precedent.
“These are not normal times in our nation, and they should not be treated as such in the United States Senate,” Booker said at one point. “The threats to the American people and American democracy are grave and urgent, and we all must do more to stand against them.”
The senator covered a breadth of topics: health care, Social Security, Medicaid, grocery prices, free speech, veterans, public education, world leaders, Elon Musk’s Department of Government Efficiency, and national security concerns. He read letters and comments from constituents and he quoted speeches from the late Rep. John Lewis — invoking Lewis’ famous call to action to “get in good trouble” — and the late Sen. John McCain.
“This is not right or left. It is right or wrong. This is not a partisan moment. It is a moral moment,” Booker said. “Where do you stand?”
Booker, 55, a former mayor of Newark, also assailed Trump’s policies on immigration. He said the Trump administration is doing “outrageous things like disappearing people off of American streets, violating fundamental principles of this document” — here he held up a copy of the U.S. Constitution — “invoking the Alien Enemies Act from the 1700s that was last used to put Japanese Americans into internment camps.”
“Do we see what’s happening?” Booker asked.
He spent about a half-hour reading the account of Jasmine Mooney, a Canadian citizen who was detained by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement for 12 days in March. He also noted that the Trump administration conceded Monday that it deported Kilmar Abrego Garcia, a 29-year-old Maryland man with protected legal status, to an El Salvador prison because of an “administrative error.”
“The government can’t walk up to a human being and grab them off the street and put them on a plane and send them to one of the most notorious prisons in the world, and just say, as one of our authorities did, ‘Oopsie,’” Booker said.

He spent about a half-hour reading the account of Jasmine Mooney, a Canadian citizen who was detained by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement for 12 days in March. He also noted that the Trump administration conceded Monday that it deported Kilmar Abrego Garcia, a 29-year-old Maryland man with protected legal status, to an El Salvador prison because of an “administrative error.”
“The government can’t walk up to a human being and grab them off the street and put them on a plane and send them to one of the most notorious prisons in the world, and just say, as one of our authorities did, ‘Oopsie,’” Booker said.

Lacking empathy and understanding of the positive role of public education, the president is calling for the department’s termination. Not surprising, as he has stated his love for “the poorly educated.” The lead mission statement on the DE website [&#8230;]","The Lyndon Baines Johnson Department of Education Building pictured on Nov. 25, 2024. (Shauneen Miranda/States Newsroom)Political and media blather about the potential demise of the Department of Education (DE) is continuous. Lacking empathy and understanding of the positive role of public education, the president is calling for the department’s termination. Not surprising, as he has stated his love for “the poorly educated.”
The lead mission statement on the DE website is “Fostering educational excellence and ensuring equal access.” Federal policies and funding have helped create better opportunities for students with disabilities and others that require more resources for their education. Along with anti-DEI initiatives, many students of poverty and color will be denied equal access.
One of the self-created functions of the Department of Education has been the delivery of the National Assessment of Educational Progress (NAEP). A standardized test titled as “The Nation’s Report Card”, that assesses reading and mathematics nationwide at the 4th and  8th grade levels.
The NAEP claims to offer “a common measure of student achievement” and “offers a window into the state of our K-12 education system and what our children are learning.”
The NAEP’s stated purpose of “is to measure the educational achievement and progress of the nation’s students …” NAEP results have been stagnant for decades. In 1992, 29% of students were considered proficient (or above) readers in both 4th and 8th grades. In 2024, proficiency levels were 31%  for 4th grade and 30% for 8th grade. 
“NAEP results also enable comparisons …, among various demographic groups, and over time.” NAEP test scores have accurately reflected demographic differences of school populations for decades. Schools, districts and states with lower family income levels, lower parent education levels, higher numbers of English language learners and special education students have lower test score averages. Year, after year, after year.
The Nation’s Report Card is a political hoax; not an accurate measure of learning. Presumed to be a reliable measure of school quality; it is not. Differences in test score averages always reflect student demographics.
Educators (especially educational leaders) need to stop pretending that they have considerable influence over test scores. Standardized tests are designed to allow predetermined percentages of rank. If proficiency is set at the 60th percentile (a common standard), only 40% of students can attain proficiency. NAEP reading proficiency levels nationwide have never reached 40%.
Profound improvements in test score averages come about by changing the demographics of the student population tested or by “cheating.” Retaining low level readers in 3rd grade changes the tested population in 4th grade. Removing failing students improves test score averages; regardless of curriculum or instructional method.
In Mississippi, NAEP 4th grade reading scores have increased from 21% proficient in 2013 to 32% in 2024. They attribute this “Mississippi miracle” to 3rd grade reading instruction with increased emphasis on phonics and seem overly proud that still less than one third of their students are considered literate by this measure.
Mississippi began a retention policy during the 2014-15 for 3rd graders with low-level reading levels. Thus, removing 7 to 9% (2019-23) of failing students from the tested population of 4th graders.
It seems reading deficiencies are not the only academic shortcomings in Mississippi. Basic math skills seem to have eluded state policymakers. Simple statistical comparisons should embarrass politicians and educators in Mississippi.
They pretend to have nailed the “science of reading” while lacking evidence linking phonics to improved 4th grade reading scores. There is a clear connection between the percentages of retained 3rd grade students and 4th grade proficiency levels.
There is no evidence that retention improves academic achievement in later grades or that retained students ever catch-up. There have been no sustainable gains in the reading ability of Mississippi students. 8th grade NAEP reading scores have declined, as have ACT scores, since the 3rd grade retention policy was adopted.
However, there is evidence that retention contributes to higher dropout and lower graduation rates. The threat of retention does not raise test scores.
It should be called the “Mississippi mirage.” This false claim of success is just a matter of fudging statistics. An illusion that would not play well on the Strip. Nevada is on tap to follow the same failed 3rd grade retention policy (as Mississippi) in 2029.
Low-level readers are not lazy. They didn’t choose to be in the bottom reading groups in first and second grades. If terminated, the NAEP would be missed only by politicians and media pundits that use test scores to unfairly denigrate public education and at-risk students.
Across the country, including Nevada, there is an obsession with the ill effects of the pandemic on academic achievement. There were no permanent effects on long-term academic outcomes and lives were saved by shutting down in-person classroom instruction. Test scores have mostly rebounded to previous levels with the same demographic gaps.
Spoiler alert for CCSD: Extended school days and longer academic years have never provided an effective solution to closing standardized test score gaps. There is a saturation point for learning. More of the same will not change outcomes.
Test scores have become the accepted measure for school success; despite a lack of evidence that differences in school settings and educational practices appreciably affect individual test scores. There is a continued fascination with comparisons of standardized test scores using the same tired statistical data when annual results are released. It is nonsense.",https://nevadacurrent.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/pb250082_0-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-04-02 08:59:16.089525

(File photo by Travis Bell/STATEHOUSE CAROLINA/Special to the SC Daily Gazette)The Democratic primary to replace a Lee County legislator who unexpectedly resigned in January is heading to an automatic recount.
Keishan Scott, a Bishopville City Council member, was winning Tuesday by just 10 votes among 2,860 cast. Scott had 1,435 votes to Carl Whetsel’s 1,425, according to unofficial results from the South Carolina Election Commission.
State law requires a recount when the winning margin is less than 1%.
The special election is needed to fill the seat vacated by Rep. Will Wheeler, a Bishopville Democrat who announced his resignation just three days into the 2025 session.
The district covers all of Lee County and parts of Kershaw and Sumter counties.
Lee County had issues with counting votes in November and the recount for a state Senate race that ousted Hartsville Democrat Gerald Malloy, who ultimately conceded ahead of his scheduled challenge.
Scott, who won his city council seat in 2023 at age 22, did not return to a phone call Tuesday from the SC Daily Gazette requesting comment.
Whetsel, a retired chiropractor and former Bishopville City Council member, told the Gazette he’s “going to let the process take its course.” No matter the result of the recount, he feels like a winner, said the Army combat veteran.
SC House Democrat unexpectedly resigns after easily winning a 5th term

Wheeler’s resignation left the rural district without a representative for this year’s entire regular session, which ends in May.
The special election is set for June 3. The winner of the Democratic primary will face Republican William Oden, chairman of the Sumter County GOP. No other Republican filed for the seat traditionally held by a Democrat, so a GOP primary was unnecessary.
Wheeler first won election in 2016 with an eight-way primary to replace Bishopville Democrat Grady Brown, who retired after 32 years in the chamber.
Wheeler told reporters in January he could no longer dedicate the time needed to represent his district. He also said he plans to run for a judicial seat in 2026. State law requires legislators to be out of office for at least a year before running to be a judge.
The primary to replace him happened to be the same day the House’s newest member was sworn into office.
Democrat Courtney Waters officially won a special election last week to fill the seat vacated last fall by former Rep. Marvin Pendarvis. No Republican ran for the heavily Democratic district representing North Charleston.
Waters’ swearing in brought the number of Democrats in the chamber to 35. Republicans hold a supermajority with 88 seats.
Whetsel said he feels confident there will be a 36th Democrat no matter who’s declared the recount winner.
“Myself or Mr. Scott, whoever wins is going to be a good candidate for District 50,” he said.",https://scdailygazette.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/south-carolina-house.jpg,,,2025-04-02 08:59:16.089525

Cory Booker's 25-hour-plus speech broke a record previously held by a South Carolina senator who tried to prevent passage of the Civil Rights Act (John Partipilo).U.S. Sen. Cory Booker broke the record for longest floor speech in the history of the Senate on Tuesday, surpassing the 24-hour and 18-minute record set in 1957 when South Carolina’s Strom Thurmond attempted to prevent passage of the Civil Rights Act.
Booker, a Democrat who began his remarks Monday at 7 p.m. saying he wanted to highlight President Donald Trump’s “complete disregard for the rule of law,” by Tuesday at 7:20 p.m. was raspy-voiced, occasionally teary-eyed, and wearing what he called a “ripe” shirt.
It was New York Sen. Chuck Schumer, the Senate’s Democratic leader, who interrupted Booker to say he had broken Thurmond’s record.
“Do you know how proud this caucus is of you? Do you know how proud America is of you?” Schumer said to applause and a standing ovation from his fellow Democrats and visitors.
Booker noted that Thurmond with his 1957 filibuster “tried to stop the rights upon which I stand.”
“I’m not here, though, because of his speech. I’m here despite his speech. I’m here because, as powerful as he was, the people were more powerful,” Booker said.
Wyoming Sen. Cynthia Lummis was one of just two Republican lawmakers in the chamber at the time. Lummis joined Democrats in celebrating Booker’s accomplishment by standing and clapping.
Guests and staff are normally barred from any displays of support or disapproval while sitting in the gallery, but Utah Sen. John Curtis, a Republican who was presiding over the chamber, allowed it.
Booker finally yielded the floor a few minutes after 8 p.m. Tuesday.
Booker’s record-breaking speech comes as the Democratic Party faces criticism from voters who say the party’s leaders are not doing enough to stand up to Trump’s actions, especially those that experts say fly in the face of legal precedent.
“These are not normal times in our nation, and they should not be treated as such in the United States Senate,” Booker said at one point. “The threats to the American people and American democracy are grave and urgent, and we all must do more to stand against them.”
The senator covered a breadth of topics: health care, Social Security, Medicaid, grocery prices, free speech, veterans, public education, world leaders, Elon Musk’s Department of Government Efficiency, and national security concerns. He read letters and comments from constituents and he quoted speeches from the late Rep. John Lewis — invoking Lewis’ famous call to action to “get in good trouble” — and the late Sen. John McCain.
“This is not right or left. It is right or wrong. This is not a partisan moment. It is a moral moment,” Booker said. “Where do you stand?”
Booker, 55, a former mayor of Newark, also assailed Trump’s policies on immigration. He said the Trump administration is doing “outrageous things like disappearing people off of American streets, violating fundamental principles of this document” — here he held up a copy of the U.S. Constitution — “invoking the Alien Enemies Act from the 1700s that was last used to put Japanese Americans into internment camps.”

(Kyle Dunphey/Utah News Dispatch) After her wrongful death lawsuit against the Salt Lake City Police Department was dismissed last week, Shauna Mayne, the mother of a woman killed by her ex-husband in 2022, says she will appeal to the Utah Supreme Court. 
There, she hopes her lawsuit will spur a change in Utah law that currently gives governments immunity in wrongful death lawsuits — a change her attorney says could result in police departments giving officers better resources and training.  


 Domestic violence resources

Help for people in abusive relationships is available in Utah:

Utah Domestic Violence Coalition: A confidential statewide, 24-hour domestic violence hotline can be reached at 1-800-897-LINK (5465)
YWCA Women in Jeopardy program: 801-537-8600
Utah child abuse and neglect hotline: 1-855-323-DCFS (3237)
National Domestic Violence Hotline: 1-800-799-7233



“This was the expected, in fact, desired result,” said Judson Burton, Mayne’s attorney.
Mayne sued the department in March 2024, about two years after her daughter, Amanda “Mandy” Mayne, was shot by Taylor Martin, her ex-husband. In the lawsuit, attorneys argue officers should have done more to intervene when Martin showed up at Mandy Mayne’s workplace and made threats, just two days before the murder. 
However, Utah law prevents lawsuits against a governmental entity for wrongful death, if that death was caused in part by an assault or battery. Now that the case has been dismissed, Burton said he’ll file an appeal with the Utah Supreme Court, with the goal of stripping the government of its immunity in these cases. 
With no immunity, Burton said police departments would be forced to implement changes in how they respond to domestic violence. 
“Potential liability brings about a change in behavior,” Burton said. “We’d hope that it brings about a change at a systemic level — that the police officers out there pounding the pavement, doing the hard work of trying to keep people safe, are given the resources and the training they need to properly evaluate the lethality potential every time they’re responding to a case of domestic violence.”  
Martin had a lengthy rap sheet, and had made repeated threats to Mandy Mayne and her family after he returned from a one-year stint in jail, including a text to Shauna Mayne that read “your daughter will be killed,” according to court documents. Those threats were investigated by Taylorsville police. 
Wrongful death lawsuit says SLC police didn’t do enough to stop murder of Lt. Gov.’s cousin

In August 2022, just two days before the murder, Martin showed up to Mandy Mayne’s workplace and threatened her new boyfriend. As police escorted him off the property, he told officers “I’m not going back to jail. … You guys are going to kill me before you get me into those gates,” according to court documents. 
Then on Aug. 17, 2022, between 4 a.m. and 5 a.m., Martin shot Mandy Mayne 14 times as she arrived at a bus stop in Taylorsville, headed to work. He then walked down the street and fatally shot himself. 
In the original complaint, attorneys representing the Mayne family alleged that Martin’s behavior in the days leading up to the murder warranted more action from Salt Lake City police officers. The complaint also argues that officers missed multiple red flags that suggested Martin posed a danger to Mayne and her family. And, Mayne’s attorneys say, police failed to properly investigate witness statements, communication from Martin, and to “arrange, facilitate and provide” Mayne with services available to victims of violence.
The Salt Lake City Police Department declined to comment on the lawsuit, instead pointing to previous court filings. In a motion to dismiss the case, filed in August, attorneys for the department say the Utah Governmental Immunity Act shields governments from wrongful death lawsuits.

Citing that law, Utah’s 3rd District Court Judge Laura Scott dismissed the case on March 26. Once the court’s final judgement is filed, Burton will file a notice of appeal — the Utah Supreme Court could decide to hear the case, or it might first defer to the Utah Court of Appeals. 
Either way, the dismissal was expected.   
“I understand this is a step forward for our case and am grateful to know that Mandy is one step closer to getting her day in court,” Shauna Mayne said in a statement. “I believe we have a chance to make a real difference in how police approach domestic violence cases. Victims of domestic violence deserve to have their safety taken seriously.” 
Legislature snubs funding for domestic violence health care service, forcing nonprofit to fundraise

If the case is successful, it would be the second time Mayne’s murder was the catalyst for a change in state law, and the way law enforcement officers interact with victims of intimate partner violence. 
The murder highlighted the gaps in how police respond to instances of intimate partner violence, and the lack of coordination between agencies. Mayne was the cousin of Utah Lt. Gov. Deidre Henderson, who in the months that followed the murder, advocated for legislation that required law enforcement around the state to implement a lethality assessment protocol, which identifies the most serious cases of intimate partner violence. 
Nicknamed “Mandy’s Law,” the bill passed in 2023 and has been credited for a dramatic increase in victim referrals to domestic violence shelters and service providers around the state.

“They can place their weapon in there and they can walk away,” Bedsole, who carried the Senate bill in the House, said.

He said any federally licensed firearm dealer or gun store can choose to participate in the program.
Bedsole sponsors the House version of the bill, which passed the House 98-2 in February. 
Alabama has some of the highest rates of firearm death in the nation. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 1,278 Alabamians died by gunfire in 2022, a rate of 25.5 per 100,000 people, the fourth highest in the nation and a larger total than New York States, which has almost four times the population of Alabama. 
The CDC said 840 Alabamians died by suicide in 2022. That ranks Alabama 26th for suicides per capita. In the United States, 54% of suicides were done by gunfire.
Rep. Travis Hendrix, D-Birmingham, a former policeman, shared a story of a co-worker that almost committed suicide.
“If this program was available two years ago, he probably would’ve been in a better situation,” Hendrix said.
Bedsole said the idea for the bill came from a crisis intervention conference he went to in Indiana. He said he met some people from Alabama that told him about the nonprofit program.
“Here’s the heart and passion: If we can save just one person’s life and prevent them from using their own weapon as an act of suicide, then this program is worth it,” he said.
The bill passed with a House Judiciary Committee substitute that mirrored the language of the House bill in the Senate bill. It goes to the Senate for concurrence or a conference committee.

(Photo: Hugh Jackson/Nevada Current)Amid growing numbers of traffic fatalities across Nevada, state lawmakers during interim meetings last year discussed whether red light and speed cameras or enhanced infrastructure would be the best way to improve road safety.
A long-awaited bill, backed by state traffic safety officials and Las Vegas Metropolitan Police Department, to authorize traffic enforcement by automated camera was heard Monday.
However, legislation to study, let alone mandate the traffic infrastructure side of the equation “has never materialized,” Nick Shepack, Nevada state director of the Fines and Fees Center, told state lawmakers.
Lawmakers agreed last year to create legislation “on traffic safety infrastructure that creates safety on all streets and focuses on high impact areas as well as authorizes the use of safety cameras,” Shepack said.
“We are missing the first half of the bill,” he said.
The three-hour hearing kicked off a robust discussion about repealing Nevada’s law, adopted in 1999, banning the use of speed and red light cameras. 
Senate Bill 415, heard Monday by the Senate Growth and Infrastructure Committee, would allow local jurisdictions to use automated traffic enforcement, such as red light cameras, if they chose to do so. 
Drivers could face a $100 find for running a red light under the legislation.  
The bill would require jurisdictions that want to use cameras to conduct a 60-day public awareness campaign on automated traffic enforcement. 
For the first 30 days in use, camera-automated enforcement would only result in warnings. 
Andrew Bennett, the chair of Nevada Advisory Committee on Traffic Safety, presented amended language for the bill alongside Clark County Sheriff Kevin McMahill, the National Transportation Board, and Clark County Commissioner Michael Naft.
The ACLU of Nevada, the Nevada Fines and Fees Justice Center and Clark County Public Defender’s officer presented a counter presentation to the bill about the concerns of automated traffic enforcement.  
They noted the use of automated enforcement across the country has been overused in low-income communities and communities of color and opens up the potential for sensitive data to be collected and shared. The legislation, as heard, still comes with too many lingering questions, they told lawmakers. 
“We view this as a half-baked proposal,” said Athar Haseebullah, the executive director of the ACLU of Nevada. “This is not ready to move forward. This body routinely engages in study. We say put it to a study. If this body is so compelled, put it to a ballot question.” 
[subhed]‘Seems like a conflict of interest’

	[/subhed]
McMahill told state lawmakers Monday that while he wasn’t “a proponent of big government” it was the growing number of traffic accidents, and deaths, that changed his mind. 
“I’m not a proponent, really, of traffic cameras, until the last 10 years or so,” he said. “The bottom line is that I’m sick and tired of people dying on our roadways because of the bad behavior of other drivers.”
Roughly 160 people were killed on Clark County roads last year, McMahill said. 
“We’re here today because 3,535 people have lost their lives in Nevada on our roadways over the last decade,” Bennett added. 
The growing number of deaths, he said, demanded urgency. Traffic officials previously told lawmakers during the interim session that the number of fatalities in the state from 2019 to 2022 has increased 36%. 
“The National Conference for state legislators shows that 33 states currently allow the use of this technology in all or specific situations,” Bennett said, adding that automated enforcement “saves lives.” 
“I think there are certain aspects of government that we should not privatize,” Democratic state Sen. Rochelle Nguyen, chair of the Senate Growth and Infrastructure committee. “I do have some concerns that we are privatizing our law enforcement officers in enacting legislation like this, because that’s what we’re doing.”
The bill would enable local jurisdictions in setting up traffic cameras, though the Nevada Department of Transportation would be tasked with setting up enforcement procedural regulations.
People would be mailed the citation and would have 90 days to respond. They could also contest the ticket if they weren’t driving. 
The citations “are not classified as moving violations and will not impact a driver’s record or license,” Bennett said.  
Republican state Sen. Ira Hansen questioned how a $100 fee outlined in the language – a fine people wouldn’t get until months after the fact – would actually prevent people from speeding or running red lights. 
“I mean 100 bucks,” Hansen said. “No demerit. No insurance notification. Because, you know, those are things when you start paying an extra 500 bucks a year, $1,000 a year … that has an impact.”
Bennett said the language was to find a balance between concerns presented by groups like the Fines and Fees Justice Center.
Hansen also questioned how many of the traffic fatalities last year where a driver ran a red light or was speeding stemmed from the driver being intoxicated or on drugs.
Bennett said he wasn’t able to get that information prior to the hearing.
Since the idea of automated enforcement gained traction in Nevada, opponents have warned that some jurisdictions across the country have used red light cameras as a revenue source. 
An amendment to the bill Bennett presented said any additional funds collected from enforcement would be allocated to cover the cost of the program. Any additional funds after that would be used exclusively for engineering improvements in that jurisdiction, he said. 
The legislation also prohibits per-ticket contracts and profit sharing with the vendors.
Nguyen said the bill needs more guardrails to prevent excessive fines and fees. 
”That money still goes to law enforcement,” she said. “It seems like a conflict of interest.”
Sponsors also amended their original bill to add a provision prohibiting governments from sharing information with immigration enforcement agencies. 
Haseebullah said the provision was “a nice gesture” but he is wary of its practical effect.
“It would require us to have information access to everything in their possession, and we don’t,” he said. “I don’t know if relying on the ACLU to put in public records requests to the same bodies hiding this information or charging us sums of money in order to get this data is an effective solution.”
Deter behavior
The bill’s opponents urged lawmakers to refocus on traffic infrastructure, including using items like roundabouts or changing the design of streets, to reduce accidents.
“You make the roads less wide,” Shepack said. “You build in buffer lanes between the crosswalks and the streets. In Vegas we have a huge problem with a bus stop being in the middle of the block. It’s 118 degrees and people have to run across four lanes of traffic. You can put in certain medians to deter this behavior.”
Clark County Commissioner Michael Naft suggested many of those ideas have been “implemented today in unincorporated Clark County and I would dare to say in the other jurisdictions who spoke today as well.”
“That doesn’t mean the work is done,” Naft said. “We have much more to do when it comes to infrastructure. There are billions of dollars we could spend on infrastructure to ensure everyone is safe in our community. Alternatively, we have this route, which does allow a path for some consequence, for some action to be taken when someone violates the law and for some accountability to be had.”

Representatives of the  Southern Poverty Law Center; Faith in Action Alabama and the League of Women Voters of Alabama urged lawmakers to consider bills that allow people to cure their absentee ballot affidavits, eliminate obstacles for people who are formerly incarcerated to regain their voting rights, and stump for the Alabama Voting Rights Act that protects voters from possible voter discrimination.
“Voting should be a simple, convenient process that allows every eligible voter to easily participate,” said Jerome Dees, policy director for the Southern Poverty Law Center. “But we know in Alabama, far too often, that is not the case.”

The proposals, mostly sponsored  by Democrats, have yet to garner any consideration from the Republican-dominated Legislature.
“I don’t know of any issues of people having trouble voting,” said Rep. Bob Fincher, R-Woodland, the chair of the House Constitution, Campaigns and Elections Committee in an interview Monday evening.  “Anyone who is eligible to vote in the state may register.”
The bills have stalled amid fears that states are further restricting access to the ballot box.
“I think nationally, what we are seeing, is an increasing gulf between states that are moving to restrict access to the ballot and making it harder for people to vote, and states that are doing the opposite and making it easier for people to vote, and increasing access to the ballot box,” said Jonathan Diaz, director of voting advocacy and partnerships with the Campaign Legal Center, a nonpartisan democracy rights organization.
States that have increased restrictions for voting have focused on laws that prove eligibility.
“Basically, requiring voters to provide new and burdensome documentation or paperwork requirements to prove their eligibility, so states requiring passports or birth certificates, or other documents that many Americans don’t have even if they are a U.S. citizen, or that would require some kind of cost or time to obtain,” Diaz said.
Alabama has had a photo voter ID requirement since 2014. In recent years, it has banned drop boxes for ballots and private aid for conducting elections. Last year, the Legislature approved a measure criminalizing some forms of absentee ballot assistance, a law that was partially blocked by a federal judge last fall.
Civil rights groups are monitoring two fronts, concerned with not only rules and regulations that states are imposing on voting, but also the federal government that has followed laws enacted by states.
The SAVE Act, which is currently working its way through Congress, would require people to provide another set of documentation to register to vote, such as enhanced drivers’ licenses, passports or birth certificates.
It would also hinder efforts of people to register to vote by mail and online, while increasing the frequency that states must update their voter rolls by removing people from their voter registration lists.
“Election workers could go to prison for up to five years if they help to register somebody without the correct documents, even if the registered voter is a citizen,” according to an explainer from the CLC.
“This is not going to save anything,” said Kathy Jones, president of the League of Women Voters of Alabama, at Tuesday’s rally. “It is going to disenfranchise a whole lot of people.”
President Donald Trump also issued an executive order to further restrict voter access by requiring people to provide proof of citizenship, such as a passport, to register to vote. It also prohibits state election officials from counting ballots received after the election allowed by state law or having their federal funding withheld.
Diaz said that the Campaign Legal Center filed a lawsuit to challenge the president’s authority to implement additional regulations aimed at further restricting voters’ access to the ballot box.
“The constitution is very clear that the president does not have the authority to set election policies or set voter registration requirements,” Diaz said. “The states have that responsibility, and Congress has the power to set national rules by legislating. The constitution has no role for the president in the establishment of election rules.”
Among the bills that groups prioritized during the event is SB 7, sponsored by Sen. Kirk Hatcher, D-Montgomery, called the Alabama Voting Rights Act. The bill is comprehensive meant to address several aspects of voting that have been priorities for voting rights groups.
Hatcher’s bill creates the Alabama Voting Rights Commission that would assume the role that the U.S. Department of Justice performed prior to 2013’s Shelby County v. Holder ruling by the U.S. Supreme Court that struck down a portion of the Voting Rights Act requiring the U.S. Department of Justice to preclear changes to voting laws in jurisdictions with a history of discriminatory voting practices.
The bill would also allow voters to cast absentee ballots without citing a reason like illness or confinement.
It would also allow people who were released in prison to regain their voting rights automatically for crimes considered crimes of moral turpitude after they meet the conditions of their parole absent paying for court costs and fines and restitution.
“If we can have a convicted felon to be president, then why are we setting up barriers to stop people from voting,” said Gregory Scott, pastor of Christian Methodist Episcopal Church in Huntsville, who spoke for Faith in Action Alabama during Tuesday’s rally. “That is hypocritical, and if Alabama is to be the kind of state it needs to be, we cannot have that kind of hypocritical work done in this Legislature.”
HB 31, sponsored by Rep. Adline Clarke, D-Mobile, allows people with a disability, or those unable to read or write, to designate someone to assist them with delivering an absentee ballot application or the absentee ballot itself, to the election manager.
“I know that bill, and I believe that people with a disability should receive assistance,” Fincher said. “We are working with the Secretary of State’s Office to address that issue administratively, so that is the reason that has not been introduced.”
HB 97, sponsored by Rep. Kenyatté Hassell, D-Montgomery, allows people to cure their absentee ballot affidavit if they submit them before the election and the absentee election manager finds an error. Currently, the ballots are set aside and not counted if election officials find a defect with the affidavits.
HB 64, sponsored by Rep. Ontario Tillman, D-Bessemer, would make election day a federal holiday so that people are able to vote without excusing themselves from work.
Thus far, none of the bills have even been considered in their respective committees.
“I think it would give credibility to the state of Alabama,” said Terry Hamilton-Poore, pastor of First Presbyterian Church in Birmingham, of expanding voting rights for Faith in Action Alabama. “Right now, this state is viewed as backwards, and it is not entirely wrong in terms of our politics.”

Faulkner passed a bill in 2019 that required schools to offer computer science courses but did not require students to take the classes.
Rep. Mary Moore, D-Birmingham, said she wanted to know that schools are equipped to teach the classes before requiring students to take it.
“Are we sure that we have the number of teachers that would be able to teach computer science? Now once we’ve got all of that in place, then I think your bill is in order,” Moore said.
Rep. Laura Hall, D-Huntsville, echoed Moore. She said she is concerned about how artificial intelligence would be incorporated into the definition of computer science.
“So pushing this computer thing, I’m not sure the right thing,” she said. “We may be on the right track, but I think it goes beyond that.”
Faulkner said that a House Education Policy Committee substitute expanded the definition of computer science to include AI, coding languages and quantum computing. The substitute passed 98-2.
Rep. Danny Garrett, R-Trussville, said that he and Sen. Arthur Orr, R-Decatur, who chairs their respective Education Trust Fund committees in the House and Senate, met with State Superintendent Eric Mackey on the computer science classes. He supported the need for a loose definition of computer science.
“It’s got to be fluid, changing, whatnot. So a lot of it is dynamic,” Garrett said.

(Photo provided by Humane Society of the United States)Efforts by local governments to put a kink in the pipeline between midwest puppy mills and Nevada are being derailed by neighboring municipalities that permit retail sales of dogs and cats, say advocates of legislation that would expand the bans statewide.
The bill is sponsored by Assemblywoman Natha Anderson and was heard Tuesday by the Assembly Committee on Natural Resources.
“Eight states, including the entire West Coast and nearly 500 localities, including Clark County, Reno, North Las Vegas, and Mesquite have prohibited the sale of puppies in pet stores,” testified Rebecca Goff of Humane World for Animals, formerly the Humane Society of the U.S. “Assembly Bill 487 can bridge that divide and allow us to bring our nation one big step closer to that day when puppy mills must no longer exist.”
The City of Henderson allows pet sales at existing stores, while the City of Las Vegas has refused to ban sales, prompting retailers affected by the ban to move across city limits and into pet store-friendly territory. 
Regulations imposed by Las Vegas in lieu of a ban have increased transparency and “exposed just how awful the puppy mill pipeline is,” Goff told lawmakers. “It’s crucial that this should be tackled statewide, rather than a patchwork of ordinances.” 
An undercover investigation by the Humane Society released in January alleges pet stores in Southern Nevada are keeping sick puppies without seeking veterinary treatment, and in at least one case, failing to obey a law requiring regular veterinarian visits for animals for sale.
The legislative measure is named for Cindy Lou, a sick Havenese puppy kept in a pen in the employee bathroom at Puppy Heaven and allegedly denied medical care until animal officials who were tipped off the illness required the store to take her to a veterinarian, where she died, according to the investigation.
“Her story is a heartbreaking example of what happens when profit is placed above animal welfare,” testified Christy Stevens, executive director of Hearts Alive Village, who described horrific incidents of animal cruelty and neglect that were allegedly known to a Las Vegas pet store that continued to sell animals to the alleged perpetrator. “These are not isolated incidents. They are part of a systemic problem.”
Clark County’s largest shelter, the Animal Foundation, as well as the Nevada Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals support the measure. 
The legislation would permit pet stores to hold adoption events for shelters and rescues. It prohibits the sale of pets on street corners, parking lots, and other public places. A violation of the proposed law would be a misdemeanor.
The legislation would give the 15 retail stores that sell pets in Nevada a year to adjust their business model. 
The Retailers Association of Nevada is neutral on the legislation, testified executive director Bryan Wachter. 
“The vast majority of pet stores in Nevada already do not sell puppies, but rather thrive as part of the $147 billion pet products and service industry,” Goff testified. 
Pet store puppies are likely to be sick or have behavioral issues, making them more likely to land in local shelters, supporters of the measure said. 
Amy Jesse of Humane World for Animals noted a report from the Centers for Disease Control that traced a drug-resistant, multistate human infection outbreak to “puppies from breeders and distributors sold through pet stores as the outbreak source.” Of 149 retail store puppies, 95% received one or more courses of antibiotics. 
The bill is opposed by pet stores, some of which are named in the Humane Society investigation, including the owner of Petland in Henderson. 
Ken Kirkpatrick, owner of Petland in Boca Park, testified he and his staff have provided pets and peace of mind to Las Vegans since 2001 in a highly regulated environment. He predicted backyard breeding will expand. thanks to demand from families “who can’t adopt from shelters or rescues because they want a specific breed, or they need a hypoallergenic dog.”
Kirkpatrick noted a review of the Animal Foundation’s adoption list revealed 200 dogs for adoption. For a population of 2.5 million people, “it’s really not that many dogs.” 
On Tuesday, the Animal Foundation listed 370 dogs for adoption. Last year, the shelter euthanized more than 3,300 dogs, down from just under 3,900 the previous year. 
Assemblywoman Heidi Kasama, a Republican from Clark County, said her family visited a shelter recently while looking for an addition to the family “and for some reason it was just not a right fit. I wanted a smaller dog, and we ended up at a pet store.”",https://nevadacurrent.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/cindylou-1024x642.png,,,2025-04-02 08:03:46.657422

College students experience food insecurity at nearly twice the rate of all American households. Photo by Grace Aigner for Minnesota Reformer. While many college students are concerned about where they’ll score a summer internship or scoping out the next good party, fourth-year Minnesota State University student Em Hodge and many people she knows have an entirely different concern: food insecurity.  
“I know a lot of students and friends I’ve worked with don’t know where their next meal is coming from,” Hodge said. “And SNAP could really, really benefit them, but they just make a little too much money,” she said, referring to the federal-state food aid program and its tight eligibility requirement for students.   
“Which is just so unfortunate,” said Hodge, a student lobbyist with Students United. 
Hodge and her fellow students are not alone. College students experience food insecurity at nearly twice the rate of all American households and have been disproportionately underserved by SNAP. 
More than one in five graduate and undergraduate students at the University of Minnesota said they worried about having enough food until they had money to buy more, the university’s 2024 College Student Health Survey found. 
Now, some Democratic-Farmer-Labor lawmakers hope to make life a little easier for students like Hodge. With the help of Second Harvest Heartland and a university student lobbying group called Students United, the lawmakers want to loosen Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program eligibility requirements to allow more college students to enroll. 
Sen. Aric Putnam, DFL-St.Cloud, said current policies don’t accurately reflect the needs of today’s college students.
“There’s a very dismissive presumption that college students can survive off of ramen and Natural Light for four years, and then they’ll be fine,” said Putnam, referring to the cheap noodles and beer that have sustained many a college student. “That’s not today’s college student.”

To receive benefits, Minnesota college students must meet one federal SNAP eligibility requirement, like working 20 hours a week, having a documented mental or physical disability or caring for a child 11 years old or younger. Photo by Grace Aigner for Minnesota Reformer.
In 2021, Carolyn Litzell was a non-traditional student in her 30s with a full course load, a part-time job and an unpaid internship while paying bills and tuition. Litzell said SNAP was a bureaucratic nightmare. But she relied on it.
“Six or eight times I re-upped my SNAP, every single time it was rejected and then I would have to appeal through a legal process,” Litzell said. “Now imagine English isn’t my first language or I didn’t have people who were willing to help me get my paperwork.”
The hoops
To receive benefits, Minnesota college students must meet one federal SNAP eligibility requirement, like working 20 hours a week, having a documented mental or physical disability or caring for a child 11 years old or younger. 
Litzell said SNAP eligibility requirements are unrealistic for students.
“Every time you got a new job — and when you’re a student you get new jobs sometimes three or four times a year — you would have to report,” Litzell said. “And the reporting process is, not to be conspiratorial, but I think intentionally obtuse.”
Indeed, Sophie Wallerstedt, spokesperson for Second Harvest Heartland, said a lack of awareness that students may be eligible and the intimidating SNAP application process contribute to students’ underutilization.
What a bill could do
Putnam and lobbyists from Second Harvest and Students United attempted to expand SNAP eligibility in 2023 with a bill that allowed Minnesota state colleges and the University of Minnesota to designate their institution as a SNAP Employment and Training program, effectively making more students eligible for SNAP.
“These are resources to which people are entitled already, and they are being actively neglected,” Putnam said.
The bill passed the Legislature, but was denied by the Biden administration, and the Trump administration is unlikely to change course. 
Putnam said potential federal spending cuts to programs like SNAP — which congressional Republicans are mulling even as Elon Musk’s DOGE takes a chainsaw to the entire government — are worrisome.
Wallerstedt, the spokesperson for Second Harvest, said SNAP cuts would mean increasing strain on campus food pantries. 
The need for campus pantries
Indeed, while a SNAP eligibility expansion remains unsettled, Students United is focused on getting more funding for campus food pantries. 
The Hunger Free Campus Grant, passed in 2021, funds campus food pantries. The University of Minnesota, Mankato State University and Macalester College were among the 2024 grant recipients.
The Office of Higher Education awarded 24 schools a total of almost $450,000 as part of the Hunger Free Campus grant program in 2024.
Michelle Trumpy said state funding is essential to Nutritious U’s ability to purchase and store food. The campus pantry currently serves 1,800 students every month, 400 more students than the previous school year.
A bill introduced to the state Senate on March 13 would fund the Hunger Free Campus Grant through 2027. 
Putnam said the grant provides food and educational resources.
“You don’t see the education that travels with (the food) too, because that’s not as obvious,” Putnam said. “The nutrition discussions, the information about different resources that could be available, all of those things are great.”
Litzell said visiting Nutritious U — the University of Minnesota’s food pantry — was a comfortable experience, which is important for students who might otherwise attach shame to needing the food pantry.
“It was easy to get to, it was easy to get, the line always moved really fast, they were actually super efficient,” Litzell said. “Getting that amount of food felt good.”
Hodge said she wants to see the reliable campus food pantry at Minnesota State expand. 
“I’ve been through some phases where money is tight, so I’ll go to the food pantry,” Hodge said. 
Wallerstedt of Second Harvest Heartland said supplementing SNAP with a visit to a food shelf to get through the lean times is fine as a temporary measure, but it can’t be the only game in town. 
“It should not have to be the only thing that is available to students,” she said.",https://minnesotareformer.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/decisions-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-04-02 08:03:46.657422

After I retired I  started volunteering at a local food shelf called VEAP.
VEAP — Volunteers Enlisted to Assist People — is one of the largest food pantries in Minnesota. Last year it provided over 4.6 million pounds of food to over 250,000 Minnesotans. Almost the entire operation is driven by volunteers: scheduling appointments, sorting donations, and running pantry operations to provide food to customers. 
There are almost 500 food shelves across Minnesota, some large like VEAP, and many much smaller. Most depend heavily on volunteers and donations. 
Food shelves are supported by larger organizations called food banks — like Second Harvest Heartland and The Food Group. Food banks partner with grocery retailers, manufactures and farmers to source and warehouse food that they distribute to food shelves in communities across the state. They also depend on donations and volunteers. 
This is a remarkable system, a credit to the people that put time, energy and money into building and maintaining it. 
But right now, it is strained by an incredible increase in demand. 
Reliance on food shelves has skyrocketed since the pandemic. The number of people seeking help at VEAP has more than doubled since 2020. According to the Food Group, that reflects the same trend across the entire state. In 2024, Minnesotans made 9 million visits to food shelves.
Food inflation is certainly one driver. And the end of pandemic emergency SNAP benefits in 2023 took away a primary support — a loss of $100 a month for the average family.
A study by Second Harvest Heartland, in partnership with Wilder Research, found that 1 in 5 Minnesotans are “food insecure,” meaning they don’t have access to the food they need, usually because they can’t afford it. This includes 26% of families with children and 40% of households of color. 
The study also found that food aid — food shelves and/or SNAP benefits — helped more than half of food insecure Minnesotans have enough food to eat. That’s great; we know that we can make a difference for hungry families. 
But it is hard to read this and not ask: How can there be people without enough food in the richest country in the world? 
And be reminded that this is a question we have been asking for decades. 
The development of a broad network of food banks and food shelves started to expand rapidly around 1980. By one account, 80% of the food shelves in the U.S. in 2001 had opened since 1980. 
Why did our nation suddenly need so many food shelves after 1980? Certainly, the economy was a factor, as late 1970s stagflation gave way to a deep recession in the early 1980s. 
But it was also the year Ronald Reagan was elected president and changed the course of American social policy. 
With the election of John F. Kennedy in 1960, the U.S. moved toward a more progressive approach to social policy. The highlight of this period was Lyndon Johnson’s Great Society and War on Poverty. Even Richard Nixon proposed a guaranteed family income and universal health coverage (although neither was enacted). 
Reagan stopped this progress, cutting public assistance and food stamps and other social services. 
Progress on advancing social policy has been bumpy ever since. The “Reagan Revolution” had successfully sold the idea that government was the problem. 
Forty-five years later, in our current moment, we can certainly recognize how deeply this message has sunk into the American psyche and how it continues to drive policy debates. 
And so, once again, federal funding to fight hunger is vulnerable to cuts. 
The federal government has long provided funding to states to support emergency food. It’s not a lot of money but has provided a base for the emergency system. Two funding sources have already been cut, a loss of $6.7 million in food intended for Minnesota food banks.  
More critically, of course, is SNAP formerly known as food stamps. Congress is poised to cut over $200 billion from SNAP over the next 10 years. Cutting SNAP at this level would require reducing benefits to families or cutting people completely off SNAP — or some combination of the two. 
The result will be more hunger. 
The incredible success of the emergency food system — a mostly non-profit, volunteer-driven sector — is not enough to make up for hundreds of billions of dollars. 
That doesn’t mean we shouldn’t try — volunteer, donate, do what you are able to do. 
But problems of this scope need public policy solutions and investments. 
In the 1980s, conservatives liked to say that President Lyndon Johnson launched a War on Poverty and poverty won.
In fact, by the late 1970s the U.S. poverty rate was half what it was in 1960, before the War on Poverty.  
To paraphrase Matthew Desmond from his book “Poverty, by America,”  did we lose the war on poverty, or did we just stop fighting?
Maybe that’s why there are hungry people in the richest country in the world.",https://minnesotareformer.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/velveeta-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-04-02 08:03:46.657422

(Photo courtesy of the Executive Office of Gov. Ron DeSantis)Given Gov. Ron DeSantis’ penchant for political theater, full embrace of a far-right extremist agenda, and need for attention, it’s not surprising that he would attach himself to the Trump-Musk DOGE project.
Despite the utter chaos the project has created at the federal level, DeSantis recently announced the creation of a Florida version of the Department of Governmental Efficiency (DOGE) task force, which he claims will target and eliminate “waste” in state government, save taxpayers money, and “ensure accountability” in Florida.
The Florida DOGE task force will work similarly to the “department” created by President Donald Trump and led by Elon Musk, the tech billionaire who is unelected and unaccountable to the American people. Musk and his minions have orchestrated the slashing of agency budgets since Trump came back into office on Jan. 20.
Florida Democratic Party Chair Nikki Fried’s response to the announcement captures the absurdity of DeSantis’ action.

“Republicans have been in total control of Florida’s government for nearly 30 years, and he wants to talk about government waste?” she said.
“Ron has consistently passed the largest state budgets in Florida’s history, illegally spent millions of taxpayer dollars to run political campaigns to take down Amendments 3 & 4, and just allocated $250 million to fund his political stunt on immigration. Don’t lecture us on wasting taxpayer dollars.”
Fried argues everyone knows “this isn’t about reigning in spending — it’s about Trump endorsing Byron Donalds instead of Casey DeSantis. Maybe Ron should have considered the political consequences before he decided to run against the leader of his party for president.”
DeSantis said the DOGE team will likely shutter 70 boards and commissions this year to cut costs. Meanwhile, the task force will review 900 positions in state agencies to ascertain whether they should be cut.
His intention to have the task force “identify potential wasteful spending in college and university operations” should be viewed as dubious after he signed legislation last year that banned public colleges and universities from using taxpayer money to promote diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI).
Institutional memory
The governor’s hostility towards Black Floridians and his crusade to eradicate any programs to level the social, political, economic, and business playing fields continue unabated. It’s likely that DOGE will be just another tool to eviscerate any entity deemed a threat to DeSantis’ implementation of an arch-conservative imprimatur on Florida.
There is also the fear that Florida will lose experienced civil servants who not only carry out critical government functions but also carry with them critical institutional memory. As it has played out nationally, the DOGE carousel will distract state employees from focusing on the people’s work.
If past is prologue, this political power move will increase fear among employees that they may lose their jobs, inducing paralysis among the ranks.
Most of all, Florida government’s best employees may seek greener pastures to the detriment to the state’s people.
DeSantis said the task force will use artificial intelligence to reduce “bureaucratic bloat.” He said the DOGE team will be a continuation of the cost-cutting measures he has overseen during his six years in office. The governor boasted that Florida saved $3.8 billion in last year’s budget and has paid down 41% of state debt since 2019.










DeSantis’ plan comes even though Florida has the lowest number of government employees per capita of any state, and the state has about $14.6 billion in cash reserves.


DeSantis’ plan comes even though Florida has the lowest number of government employees per capita of any state and $14.6 billion in cash reserves. Yet DeSantis is looking to slash 740 full-time jobs and scrap as many as 900 more related “off-the-books” positions.
Democrats pushed back by noting that Florida already has in place a voter-approved government efficiency task force created in 2006 that carried “an almost identical mandate;” Florida DOGE therefore itself is an example of unnecessary spending. The effort is really an attempt to flatter Trump and Musk to restore DeSantis to his party’s good graces.
GOP pushback
If Floridians are lucky, the significant pushback verbalized by the leaders of both of Florida’s Republican-supermajority legislative chambers may end up with DeSantis’ cockamamie plan being tossed to the trash pile.
  Sen. Ben Albritton via Florida Senate
  Speaker Daniel Perez via Florida House
“Let’s focus on what matters. Let’s pass actual reforms rather than symbolic gestures,” Daniel Perez, the Florida House speaker, told members on the legislative session’s opening day. “Let’s repeal government programs instead of reshuffling them. Let’s swing for the fences and not just try to get on base.”
Perez turned the knife a little deeper when he said that “DeSantis, a self-styled fiscal conservative, benefited from a 70% budget increase for the executive office of the governor over his six years in office.”
Senate President Ben Albritton, a member of the existing efficiency taskforce, said in remarks to the Senate that he was proud that Florida already “has a great framework for accountability,” and that he and other lawmakers had made a substantive number of recommendations “to improve flexibility [and] simplify processes.”
“The fact is we are a state and nation of laws that should be created by elected officials accountable to the people who elected them, not appointed professional staff,” he said.
None of this may matter though, because DeSantis has his eyes firmly set on running for the White House in 2028, which necessitates rebuilding the frayed ties with Trump and his loyal supporters, as well as positioning his wife Casey to run for governor when he sets down in 2027.

Rick Brattin of Harrisonville speaks in May 2024 during the Freedom Caucus filibuster blocking approval of provider taxes essential to funding Medicaid (Rudi Keller/Missouri Independent).In the spring of 2023, efforts were underway to put the question of restoring abortion access to Missouri voters. Abortion-rights supporters geared up to collect the roughly 171,000 signatures required to put a constitutional amendment on the ballot.
Per the state’s initiative petition process, then-Secretary of State Jay Ashcroft wrote a summary of their proposed constitutional amendment. A staunch abortion opponent then running for governor, Ashcroft drafted the first part of his summary of the petition to say: “Do you want to amend the Missouri Constitution to: allow for dangerous, unregulated, and unrestricted abortions, from conception to live birth.”
It was not what the drafters had in mind. They took him to court — and won.
A judge nixed Ashcroft’s summary and wrote a new one.
A Republican-sponsored bill that has cleared the state Senate and received a House committee hearing Tuesday would make it more difficult for judges to rewrite a secretary of state’s ballot summary.
“To me this is a gross overstepping of the judiciary branch,” state  Sen. Rick Brattin, a Harrisonville and the bill sponsor, said at Tuesday’s hearing.
In Brattin’s opinion, shared by opponents to abortion rights, the courts wrote a summary slanted in favor of the initiative petition that would become Amendment 3, ultimately passed by voters last November.
Senate Bill 22 allows a group to appeal the secretary of state’s summary. The court can make recommendations, but the secretary of state must revise the language within seven days
If the court finds that summary unfair, the secretary gets five days to write another draft. This process can happen one last time, and upon third revision the secretary gets just three days. Only then, if the court still finds the summary unfair, can a judge rewrite it. The back-and-forth process must take place on a set timeline prior to the general election.
Brattin’s original bill eliminated the court’s ability to rewrite a ballot summary, he said at the committee hearing, but he worked with Senate Democrats to amend it.
“This was (a) compromise,” Brattin said.
For opponents of the bill, the timeline would make it nearly impossible to oppose the secretary of state’s ballot language. The process would need to play out more than 70 days before the election.
“If the time runs out, the challenge is extinguished, and it seems to me like whatever the last language is would stand, even if the court still thinks it’s not fair,” said state Rep. Eric Woods, a Kansas City Democrat.
Sam Lee, a veteran anti-abortion lobbyist, argued courts can expedite cases related to an election. He spoke on behalf of Campaign Life Missouri and testified in support of the measure along with a representative from Missouri Right to Life.
Groups including the League of Women Voters of Missouri, the American Civil Liberties Union of Missouri, the Missouri Voter Protection Coalition, Missouri Jobs with Justice Voter Action and the Missouri AFL-CIO testified in opposition to the measure. Many voters echoed Woods’ concerns about the feasibility of the proposed timeline.
“What if today our Secretary of State was a Democrat?” asked Ron Berry, a lobbyist for Missouri Jobs with Justice and a former staffer for Democratic Secretary of State Robin Carnahan. “Would we be here today discussing this bill?”

(Getty Images)Early literacy forms the foundation on which a child’s academic and life success is built. Extensive research shows that children who achieve reading proficiency by third grade are more likely to graduate high school, pursue higher education, and secure stable employment. In contrast, those who struggle with reading at this critical stage often encounter greater obstacles both academically and in life.
As Indiana works to improve early literacy rates, the latest Indiana Reading Evaluation and Determination (IREAD-3) results highlight both progress and persistent gaps demanding urgent attention.
Each year, Indiana’s third graders take the IREAD-3 assessment, which evaluates foundational reading skills such as phonics, vocabulary, and comprehension. In the 2023-2024 school year, 82.5% of students demonstrated literacy proficiency—an increase from 81.9% in 2023. While this improvement is encouraging, overall proficiency levels remain below pre-pandemic rates, underscoring the lingering impact of COVID-19 on early education.
More concerning are the disparities found among student populations. Twenty-seven of Indiana’s 92 counties had proficiency rates below the state average, 5 more counties than in 2023. Special education students had the lowest overall proficiency, with a 31.1 percentage point gap compared to their general education peers, and English learners’ proficiency was over 21 percentage points lower than that of non-English learners. Students from low-income households also showed lower proficiency rates, highlighting the impact of economic disparities on early literacy.
Early childhood experiences
Literacy development begins long before a child enters kindergarten. The first five years are a critical period of brain development, shaping cognitive, social, and emotional growth. High-quality early learning environments, rich language exposure, and supportive relationships with caregivers are essential for early literacy success.
Unfortunately, many Indiana children face barriers to these experiences. Approximately 42% of children under age three live in households with incomes below twice the federal poverty level, and 18% of children under five live in poverty. Financial hardship often brings additional stressors, such as food insecurity and unstable housing, which can hinder early learning. Chronic absenteeism—heightened by the pandemic—remains a significant concern, particularly for students from low-income families, who may face transportation challenges or other obstacles to consistent attendance.
Despite these challenges, Indiana has made strides in providing early intervention services, with high participation rates in developmental screenings, early intervention programs, and home-visiting services, all of which positively impact school readiness and long-term achievement.
Expanding Access to Quality Early Learning
Access to high-quality early childhood education is a proven strategy to foster literacy and close literacy gaps. Research shows children attending such programs demonstrate stronger reading and math skills in later grades.
The state’s On My Way Pre-K program provides access to high-quality preschool for low-income four-year-olds. However, Indiana’s funding for such programs remains among the lowest in the nation. Furthermore, many children, particularly in rural areas, lack access to quality preschool programs. Investment in early education systems benefits not just individual children but also strengthens the state’s workforce and economic future.
Literacy Development
Indiana has taken promising steps to enhance literacy through innovative programs and strategic investments.
A $9.5 million investment from Lilly Endowment Inc. supports literacy through out-of-school time (OST) programs. Led by the Indiana Afterschool Network, this initiative reinforces in-school learning through before-school, after-school, and summer opportunities. Using the Science of Reading framework, the program strengthens word recognition and language comprehension. Launching in 2025, the initiative will provide grants, professional development, and workforce credentials for OST staff to ensure high-quality literacy programming.
Another program having a positive impact on literacy is the Imagination Library of Indiana, which fosters a love of reading among young learners by ensuring access to free monthly books. Through Dolly Parton’s Imagination Library, children receive high-quality books at no cost, helping them build home libraries and develop early literacy skills. Research has validated this program’s effectiveness in improving reading readiness and inspiring a culture of literacy in families across the state.
Reach Out and Read Indiana is another evidence-based program dedicated to giving young children a foundation for success. Integrating books into pediatric care, this model provides training and resources to pediatric clinicians to promote shared reading and meaningful family interactions. Research has shown that building strong foundational relationships through reading together can mitigate the negative effects of adverse childhood experiences (ACEs). Recognized by the American Academy of Pediatrics, Reach Out and Read strengthens early literacy and relational health, helping children develop resilience and lifelong learning habits.
These initiatives, together with current state efforts, demonstrate Indiana’s commitment to enhancing early literacy through both in-school and out-of-school learning opportunities.
Indiana’s Future
Improving literacy outcomes requires taking a multi-faceted approach, with support beginning in early childhood and running through elementary education. In 2022, Indiana set a goal for 95% of third graders to achieve reading proficiency on IREAD-3 by 2027. The following year, the Indiana General Assembly adopted the Science of Reading as the foundation for literacy instruction. In 2024, a bill enforcing retention for third graders not proficient in reading was passed and came into effect for the 2024-2025 school year.
Despite these efforts, too many young Hoosiers lack foundational reading skills. As families, teachers, youth workers, clinicians, local and state elected leaders, and employers who want to see our children succeed consider next steps, we must work together.
A strong commitment to evidence-based action can transform early literacy in Indiana. Doing so will equip all our students, regardless of background, with the foundational reading skills essential to the future of our children, workforce, and communities.

Ed Soliday, R-Valparaiso, leads an energy committee on Tuesday, March 11, 2025. (Leslie Bonilla Muñiz/Indiana Capital Chronicle)More than a billion dollars worth of government incentives to boost rural Hoosier broadband access could get tangled in the utility pole attachment fight between Indiana’s electricity providers and telecommunications companies — prompting a major potential amendment and several hostile exchanges at a Tuesday committee hearing.
“For three years of my life, I have been trying to get the utilities and the telecoms to agree,” the committee’s frustrated leader, Rep. Ed Soliday, began. “… And so, we now are here.”
“The loser in all of this is the rural person who needs broadband,” he said. “… I’m going to give out phone numbers of who to call when they come to me and say their children are going to McDonald’s to do their homework.”
Senate Bill 502 is lawmakers’ attempt to mediate.
Communities struggle to get connected, despite billions in broadband investment

For now, it would require telecommunications companies to “prove to you that there is a problem,” AT&T Indiana President Bill Soards told a corresponding Senate committee in February. His and other companies would submit information on their attachment requests to the Indiana Broadband Office quarterly until July 2030.
But a detailed amendment from Soliday, R-Valparaiso, would strike the reporting requirements and instead set deadlines to push both provider types toward collaboration — or face the consequences. If a pole owner’s noncompliance causes a telecommunications company to lose government funding for a broadband project, the owner could owe the company $25,000.
The committee didn’t take a decision on the edits Tuesday. It will consider the legislation again next week.
“Some of you are concerned about the amendment. Let me say this: it can get a lot worse,” Soliday warned. He later threatened to raise it to $250,000.
“We need to solve the problem. All the creative solutions to get around (or) away from this — I will devote my entire life to getting this done.”
Pivotal investments
Over the last four years, Indiana has poured $350 million into rural access to modern high-speed internet, according to bill author Sen. Andy Zay, R-Huntington. The state was also allocated nearly $870 million in 2023, as part of a $43 billion federal “internet for all” initiative; an estimated 150,000 Hoosier addresses are eligible, per Indiana Chief Broadband Office Steve Cox. The office is still working on a spending proposal.
Broadband providers contend that pole owners — like electric utilities — are hindering progress.
In February’s Senate committee hearing, Spectrum parent Charter Communications reported that its successful pole attachment applications averaged a nearly 400-day wait for approval. But thousands of pending applications have languished for about 500 days, on average.

Electric utilities cite incomplete and inaccurate telecommunications applications as primary causes of delay. They maintain that illegal or improperly done attachments risk damaging the state’s electric infrastructure — dubbed the “backbone for the broadband rollout,” by Michael Charbonneau, government relations head for the Indiana Electric Cooperatives.
“We have worked in good faith with other stakeholders,” Charbonneau told the committee, “to develop a framework for processing pole attachments related to broadband grant funding.”
His organization opposed the amendment, citing “significant” financial penalties, to the chagrin of lawmakers disappointed by slow progress.
“We’ve got the money to do it. So it just baffles me that, in that whole time frame, industry has not come together and figured out how to do this,” said Rep. Jim Pressel, R-Rolling Prairie.
Cooperatives berated
Soliday was more aggressive.
“You know what I think, Mr. Charbonneau? You don’t want a solution!” he asserted. “You’re in the business of broadband, aren’t you? Aren’t you? … You are competing with the broadband companies. Are you, or are you not?”
Charbonneau said 27 of his organization’s 38 members have some involvement, generally starting a decade ago, “because someone had to deliver broadband to rural Indiana.”
He pushed back on the allegations, saying, “We want rural Indiana to succeed, and it needs broadband and electricity to do so.”
Charbonneau stood before the committee for more than thirty minutes. Questions about the amendment, attachment requests, contracts and delays repeatedly lapsed into heated exchanges — prompting audible gasps from some audience members.
As lawmakers neared caucus time, Soliday said they’d continue discussions next week “because, what I heard you say in your testimony today is that, by Oct. 1, it is impossible for the REMCs (rural electric membership cooperatives) to agree to any type of timeline or performance standards with the telecoms. …”
“No, it is not —” Charbonneau began.
“Then, you can. It’s a binary question. Yes or no?” Soliday pressed.
After several more exchanges, Charbonneau said he was concerned less about the deadline and more that all parties were working “in good faith.” He sought a solution without fines.

“What you’d really like is no accountability, and we can continue with this … indefinitely. That’s what I’m hearing you say,” Soliday said, as Charbonneau reiterated his aversion to the penalties.
“Three. Years. And we wind up with storytelling every time. We need a solution. So if your answer is (that) it can’t be done, you shouldn’t even be here,” Soliday added.
“Mr. Chairman, I’m not saying it can’t be done. I’m here to say we oppose this amendment,” Charbonneau replied.
The back-and-forth continued until Soliday dubbed the REMCs the “number-one obstructionist.”
“Wow,” Charbonneau said.
“And that is a fact that I can document. And here we go again,” Soliday concluded. “So, (I’ll) be happy to see you all next Tuesday. Do you have a different amendment? How many hours have we met? All I get is mush. Thank you for your testimony. … With that, we are adjourned.”
Indiana’s broadband problems may go beyond state lines, however.
The federal broadband effort is falling behind schedule, Stateline has reported. And, under President Donald Trump’s administration, it faces an overhaul that could push lucrative contracts toward Elon Musk — the world’s richest man and a top Trump adviser — according to the National Public Radio. One of the furthest-along states, West Virginia, is reworking its proposal to better align with the administration’s desires, per Broadband Breakfast.

(Mia Maldonado / Idaho Capital Sun)As rent prices continue to rise within the Treasure Valley, a Boise-based nonprofit, Jesse Tree, successfully prevented eviction for 1,500 families in 2024. 
Jesse Tree’s mission is to prevent eviction and homelessness in the Treasure Valley. It provides financial assistance, case management and educational resources to families at risk of eviction. In February, it released its annual report highlighting the demand for rental assistance in 2024.
“We’re not just handing out a check and sending folks on their way,” Jesse Tree Grants and Communications Manager Dona Ochoa told the Idaho Capital Sun. “We’re providing education and support through the process with actual social work.”
While it successfully kept thousands of Idahoans housed, more Idaho families are relying on Jesse Tree’s help than the nonprofit can reach. 
Since 2020, Jesse Tree has seen a 132% increase in rental assistance applications. And in 2024, it helped 28% of those applicants through the eviction process. It could not help everyone because of waitlist limitations and grant requirements, Ochoa said. In those cases, Jesse Tree can provide other resources and referrals to individuals, even if they do not qualify for financial help.

Highlights from the report show in 2024 there were: 

1,615 eviction court filings in Ada County 
605 eviction court filings in Canyon County
3,608 applications from families facing eviction
$1.7 million in funds distributing to Idaho families, or about $150,000 distributed each month to keep clients housed


If you are facing eviction or struggling to pay rent, contact Jesse Tree’s Tenant Resource Center at 208-383-9486 between 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. Monday through Friday. 

 Sustaining services despite loss in federal funding

Jesse Tree at the end of 2022 lost millions of dollars in federal grants as COVID-19 funding was phased out. 
“As the need for our services continues to grow, the loss of funding makes it harder than ever to meet increasing demand,” Executive Director Ali Rabe said in the report. “Our ongoing ability to keep families safely housed is at risk.”
At the beginning of 2023, Jesse Tree had to cut its budget by 51% while sustaining its services, Ochoa said. But for the first time since at least 2018, Jesse Tree secured more private funding than government funding in 2024 — and it is preparing to continue that trend. 
“We do anticipate shifts in funding, considering what’s been happening with the current term,” Ochoa said, referring to federal grant cuts happening under the Trump administration. 
Despite federal funding cuts, Jesse Tree received $1 million in private funding in 2024.

 Preventing eviction prevents long-term homelessness

Ochoa said Jesse Tree’s ultimate goal is to prevent eviction, because an eviction record is permanent and creates barriers to accessing future housing.
Boise and Nampa had the highest number of evictions filed last year, Ochoa said.
“As folks are displaced from more expensive areas, moving costs are always a thing to consider and it leads to folks being stretched a lot more thin in Meridian, Caldwell, Nampa — the places further from their workplaces,” Ochoa said. 
Ochoa said anyone can seek information from the nonprofit’s Tenant Resource Center.
“If they just need information on Idaho’s eviction process, if they want understanding on resources they can reach out to, or if they just need to talk through options with somebody, we encourage folks to contact us,” Ochoa said.

(Whitney Downard/Indiana Capital Chronicle)Nine-year-old Jackson Moore has Angelman syndrome, a condition that delays his development. His mother, Amanda Moore, said her child is nonverbal and has frequent seizures, symptoms that are more manageable with therapy and medication.
But she worries all of his progress could be jeopardized if he loses his Medicaid coverage. 
“Our fear is that any sort of these cuts could impact his medications, it could impact the therapies that you need,” said Moore, a Hamilton County resident. “… if it was left to be covered by private insurance or families? That’s a crisis. Our private insurance covers six therapy sessions a year. He gets five a week in order to give him the quality of life he deserves.
  Rallying Hoosiers sign a birthday card addressed to Gov. Mike Braun, thanking him for supporting Medicaid in the past. (Whitney Downard/Indiana Capital Chronicle)
“So the fear of any of that going away? It’s a terrible thought.”
Moore is the CEO of the national Angelman Syndrome Foundation, pushing at the state and federal levels to protect Medicaid from potential changes that could disrupt coverage for the millions of Hoosiers enrolled in the government insurance program. She, along with roughly 200 others from all over the state, gathered at the Indiana Statehouse on Tuesday to protect Medicaid — many explicitly targeting Senate Bill 2, a proposal that would establish work requirements for some beneficiaries. 
Still, Moore was quick to note Jackson’s happy nature and preschool-like wonder, feeling “infuriated” whenever someone suggests that Medicaid’s services should be limited in a way that might exclude her son. 
Moore wouldn’t be impacted by Senate Bill 2 directly, since Jackson is covered by another Medicaid program, but she and others worry that provisions like quarterly checks could carry over. 
“Managing my son’s complex needs is already a full-time job. Now, imagine asking families like mine to complete repetitive and confusing paperwork just to maintain the basic needs he deserves,” Moore told the rally crowd. “This is not only wrong, this is dangerous … Indiana already faces serious gaps when we care for individuals with disabilities. Removing access to Medicaid will only widen that gap and it will cost lives.”
 More on Senate Bill 2

Senate Bill 2 primarily focuses on the Healthy Indiana Plan, which covers moderate-to-low-income Hoosiers. As currently written, the bill has nearly a dozen exceptions to work requirements for HIP enrollees, such as caregiving, having a disability or volunteering. 
But advocates like Tracey Hutchings-Goetz, an organizer and policy director with Hoosier Action, predict that as many as 150,000 Hoosiers could lose their HIP coverage if work requirements were established. If work requirements were implemented nationwide, some estimate 5 million adults could lose their coverage.

Providers like Allison Case, a physician with HealthNet in Indianapolis, shared her concerns about implementing a barrier for her patients, many of whom are HIP members at the federally qualified health center. 
“The majority of these patients have jobs but still struggle to make ends meet … these are people who are often one setback away from a major crisis,” said Case. 
She described a patient, dubbed “Mary,” who had a job but needed HIP to get treatment for her diabetes, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and depression. She briefly lost her coverage and Case reported losing touch with her, meaning Mary didn’t get her needed health care. 
“Finally, months later, we were able to get a hold of her … (but) she’d had multiple trips to the ER. She had run out of her medications,” Case said. “She had been in the hospital with life-threatening hyperglycemia, which would have been prevented if she had had her insulin.”
  Hoosiers hold signs urging lawmakers to protect Medicaid at the Indiana Statehouse on April 1, 2025. (Whitney Downard/Indiana Capital Chronicle)
Being so sick made Mary miss work and Mary worried that she’d lose her job, according to Case. 
“This is one example of what happens when people lose their Medicaid coverage: they get sicker,” Case said. “They can lose their jobs; they can lose their housing … 
“It costs the state more money when people are sicker and use the hospitals as a primary care clinic, rather than clinics like mine and it stresses an overwhelmed health care system. SB 2 will result in more people like Mary suffering,” Case continued.
Cuts to Medicaid could also have a disproportionate impact on the state’s rural hospitals, which cover populations that are more likely to rely on the government insurance program.
Case and others rallying to protect Medicaid pointed to the bill’s fiscal note, which projects that work requirements and quarterly eligibility checks will cost the state money because of the additional administrative workload. Additionally, the federal government funds 90% of HIP — and the state uses provider and cigarette taxes to pay for the remaining 10%.
But that funding mechanism could also be threatened, part of the bill author’s stated motivation to revisit the program. On the federal level, the current budget includes cuts that would impact the $880 billion spent on Medicaid, with a particular target on Medicaid expansion populations like HIP enrollees.

The report suggests that most of those people would lose coverage not because they aren’t complying with the rules, but because they would struggle to report their compliance to the state.
“Most adults who would lose eligibility for federal Medicaid funding are working, engaged in work-related activities, or could qualify for exemptions not readily identifiable through state databases but could still face disenrollment because of the reporting requirements,” it states. The study identified several barriers to reporting, including lack of broadband access and lack of transportation.
Forty states plus the District of Columbia have expanded Medicaid under the ACA. In 2018, 61% of Idahoans voted in favor of a ballot initiative to expand Medicaid in Idaho. Overall, nearly 72 million people, about a fifth of Americans, are enrolled in the program for low-income people, which is funded jointly by the federal government and the states.

Traditional Medicaid insurance was mainly available to children and their caregivers, people with disabilities and pregnant women. But the ACA, commonly known as Obamacare, allowed states to extend coverage to adults making up to 138% of the federal poverty level — about $21,000 a year for a single person.
Nationwide, more than 21 million people with low incomes have health insurance because of expanded Medicaid eligibility.
 U.S. House Republicans push budget plan requiring Medicaid cuts to cover GOP-supported tax cuts

U.S. House Republicans in February pushed through a budget plan, now under consideration in the Senate, that would require about $880 billion in cuts to Medicaid over the next decade to help cover the cost of $4.5 trillion in tax cuts. The budget doesn’t contain specifics on how that target would be met. But work requirements are a likely money-saving option: A 2023 analysis from the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office found that imposing work rules on Medicaid recipients ages 19 to 55 who are not parents or caregivers would cut federal spending by an estimated $109 billion over the next 10 years.
The Congressional Budget Office based that projection on a plan the GOP-controlled U.S. House approved in 2023. That bill, the likely blueprint for the work requirements Republicans are considering now, would have required adults ages 19-55 to work, participate in a job training program or perform community service for at least 80 hours per month for three or more months in a calendar year. Parents and caretakers of dependent children, and those unable to work because of a health condition, would have been exempt.
Many Republican-led states are eager to impose work requirements on able-bodied Medicaid recipients. Thirteen states received permission to impose work rules on at least some Medicaid enrollees during the first Trump administration. Nine additional states, including Idaho, requested permission to enact Medicaid work requirements during Trump’s earlier term but had not won approval by the time it ended.
When the Biden administration came into office, it rescinded all the approvals.
Supporters say requiring Medicaid recipients to work, study or train for a career gives them a boost toward self-sufficiency and financial stability. Critics, however, say such rules end up hurting far more people than they help.
The researchers from the Urban Institute mostly based their analysis on the experience of Arkansas, which in June 2018 became the first state to require some Medicaid recipients to work, volunteer, go to school or participate in job training to receive benefits. By the time a federal judge halted the policy in April 2019, 18,000 adults had lost coverage.
The researchers also looked at New Hampshire, which began implementing a work requirement but halted the program in July 2019 before suspending anyone’s coverage.
“What was found in a lot of qualitative research on the previous work requirement programs is that a lot of people were unaware of the policy, or they didn’t understand the policy,” said Michael Karpman, an Urban Institute researcher who co-authored the study.
“People who need coverage the most would do the most to try to maintain it. On the other hand, those people could also face the most difficulty with the administrative barriers,” Karpman said.
 How did work requirements for Medicaid work out for Arkansas?

In a 2020 study examining how Arkansas’ last experience with work requirements played out, researchers from the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health “found no evidence that the policy succeeded in its stated goal of promoting work and instead found substantial evidence of harm to health care coverage and access.”
Arkansas Republican Gov. Sarah Huckabee Sanders announced in January that she would ask the federal government for permission to institute work requirements, regardless of what Congress decides. The state submitted the request last week.












Especially for a rural state like Arkansas, work requirements fail to take into account a lot of the realities that people may face.


– Christin Harper, policy director for Arkansas Advocates for Children and Families




Arkansas Republican state Rep. Aaron Pilkington, who serves on the health committee in his chamber, said lawmakers “learned our lesson from the last go-round.”
Pilkington said that under the new proposal, the state will only pause coverage instead of canceling it, giving recipients an opportunity to prove they are complying. And, he said, the online portal for reporting will be a lot more user-friendly.
“I think it’s a reasonable thing to ask for able-bodied people to look for work, or try to obtain work,” Pilkington said.
But Christin Harper, policy director for Arkansas Advocates for Children and Families, said even the new version would be a challenge for many enrollees. Many people on Medicaid are juggling multiple jobs, and having to report to the state every month would be a significant burden.
“Especially for a rural state like Arkansas, work requirements fail to take into account a lot of the realities that people may face,” Harper said. She added that “with the overall job market, job opportunities may or may not be available in some of these rural towns.”

(Steven Bly/Getty Images)The challenges of modern wildlife conservation are far more complex than anything managers faced when the Idaho Department of Fish and Game was created by a citizens’ initiative in 1938. 
The agency is now undertaking a once-per-decade strategic planning process. This offers a critical opportunity for every Idahoan that enjoys what native wildlife brings to our lives. It’s now time for Idaho to embrace bold, reimagined conservation strategies that confront the growing landscape-level threats common to all wildlife species that call Idaho home.

Since the late 1800s, when many species were taken to the brink of extinction, game animal populations have largely rebounded thanks to taxes on equipment purchased by hunters and anglers. While effective for a tiny number of species like deer and elk, this approach is now woefully inadequate to address the enormous challenges Idaho’s native wildlife face today.
 Threats like habitat fragmentation, invasive species and disease, sprawl and climate change cannot be confronted by the same management mindset that worked for a handful of game species disappearing from overexploitation. Instead, all Idaho’s voices must come together to seek lasting conservation solutions.
Over 95% of Idaho’s species are not hunted, trapped or fished. Yet, only 3% of Fish and Game’s budget is allocated for their conservation.
This disproportionate focus on game species neglects the vast majority of Idaho’s wildlife, including pollinators, amphibians, birds, most mammals and more. It also shirks the fundamental mission of Fish and Game — to manage ALL of Idaho’s wildlife on behalf of ALL Idahoans. As stewards, Fish and Game needs to give nongame species a bigger seat at the table.
To truly protect Idaho’s diversity of wildlife, Idaho Fish and Game must embark on a new era of holistic conservation. This pivot would be smart for wildlife and smart for Idaho. 
Idahoans connect with wildlife differently than when Fish and Game was created. Idaho’s wildlife is a public trust resource to be managed by Fish and Game for the benefit of all Idahoans — not just hunters and anglers. Managing for a broader range of conservation values will also make Fish and Game a more resilient, contemporary, science-driven wildlife agency — not only for this decade’s strategic plan, but for generations to come.
Reimagining a funding model for Idaho Fish and Game based on revenues contributed by a wider diversity of Idahoans is also part of that evolution. Idaho Fish and Game’s budget has doubled in the last 20 years, yet nongame funds have been reduced by 50%. 
The current system, which still relies heavily on hunting and fishing revenues, is inadequate for the stewardship of all wildlife. We wish that money for nongame species from tax check-offs and license plate sales were enough, but it’s not. 
By diversifying funding sources, we can ensure all Idaho’s wildlife is taken care of. Nationwide, states are beginning to adopt innovative funding tools that enjoy popular support. Instead of robbing Peter to pay Paul, we need to grow a bigger conservation pie.
Idaho’s wildlife belongs to all of us. Let’s imagine a brighter future for all the species we love — in all their shapes and sizes. 
Idahoans can submit comments to Idaho Fish and Game until April 15. 
All wildlife enthusiasts — whether you fish, hunt, birdwatch, or simply appreciate nature — must collaborate on conservation priorities that protect Idaho’s immense wildlife heritage. The future of wildlife in our state cannot and must not be taken for granted. 
With leadership from Fish and Game, the entire conservation community can ensure the agency fulfills all its wildlife stewardship responsibilities and finds new funds to carry them out. It’s time for Idaho Fish and Game to work with all wildlife advocates and build a stronger, more resilient wildlife management agency for everyone.

In the next room, brain injury patients work with therapists to relearn daily skills, such as cooking in the center’s full-sized therapy kitchen.
USC plans to build $350M neurological hospital touted as first in Southeast

Upstairs, patients participate in video game-like therapy supported by a robotic arm. Fitted with sensors that measure grip strength and arm movement, therapists use the machine to measure patient improvements.
And along the way, patients participate in medical research studies, such as being fitted with sensors that use electric currents to stimulate swallowing.
It’s this type of rehabilitation center the University of South Carolina hopes to recreate, though on a smaller scale, in the Palmetto State. The university would couple this with a specialized neurology and neurosurgery hospital designed to handle the state’s most severe stroke, dementia and brain injury cases.
“What we’re trying to do here is not about the university, it’s about the people of South Carolina,” USC President Michael Amiridis told the SC Daily Gazette. “Our rates of death, in terms of brain trauma and in terms of stroke, are amongst the worst in the country.”
Strokes, which occur when blood flow to the brain is disrupted, were the fifth-highest cause of death in South Carolina in 2022, when 3,100 people died of the blockage. That year, the state had the tenth-highest stroke death rate nationwide, according to the latest data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
To make the proposed $350 million academic hospital and rehab center happen, the university is seeking $150 million from the Legislature, which the House included in its budget plan for the coming fiscal year.
Senate budget writers will hear from USC about the proposal Wednesday.
The remainder would come from reserve funds currently held by the state’s Medicaid agency, according to USC spokesman Jeff Stensland.

Amiridis saw firsthand the benefits of such a project during his nearly seven years as chancellor of the University of Illinois Chicago.
The Windy City’s university medical school and teaching hospital had a century-long history of neurosurgery, boasting some of the country’s leading experts in the field.
While USC’s own medical school doesn’t have the same storied history, Amiridis sees potential to grow the college’s prestige by tapping into new technologies, including robotic surgery.
“A lot of the changes that we have seen in medicine, and especially in the neurosurgery area, has to do with equipment, has to do with technology,” Amiridis said.
Similar to how USC works with companies, such as Siemens, Yaskawa robotics and Nephron Pharmaceuticals, it would form working research partnerships with the businesses that produce this new medical equipment.
Amiridis also predicts, because of its narrow focus, the teaching hospital will be “a destination of choice for physicians or graduates of medical schools who want to be neurosurgeons or neurologists,” helping grow the pool of neurological doctors in the state.
The need for more neuro expertise became evident to Amiridis and other university leadership over the past two years as the school created a network of clinics across the state to diagnose Alzheimer’s and dementia patients and increase access to care. Also in the works is USC’s $30 million Brain Health Center, an outpatient treatment and research facility expected to open this fall.
Through that process, USC researchers learned, the national average wait time for patients to get an appointment with a neurologist is one month. In South Carolina, the wait is nine months.
“You think you have Alzheimer’s disease. You want to see a doctor, and they tell you, ‘Great, we will see you next year,'” Amiridis said. “You can imagine how people feel about it, and how much we are losing.”
The project also has the support of the Alzheimer’s Association South Carolina chapter.
“South Carolina has been deemed a neurology desert, ranking among five states with the most significant projected gap between the available neurology workforce and the health needs of people with Alzheimer’s and other dementias in 2025,” Ashton Houghton, the chapter’s executive director, said in a statement. “Institutional advancements within the Palmetto State, such as USC’s proposed neurological hospital, can play an important part in expanding access to neurological care.”
USC’s plans also go beyond the critical initial treatment needed to save a stroke victim’s life.
“What happens next is extremely important as well,” Amiridis said. “You survived, but then we have to deal with the quality of life. And that in many of these cases, the difficult cases, takes a lot of time in terms of rehabilitation.”
If built, the hospital and rehab center would be the first of its kind in the Southeast.
“It doesn’t exist in the state of South Carolina, a facility like this. And the result of this is that the people who have the ability, the financial ability, go out of state, which is not acceptable in my opinion,” Amiridis said. “Those who don’t, they cannot go out of state, they have a significantly more difficult life after the event that they had with the brain.”
USC building $30M brain health center for Alzheimer’s, dementia treatment

Outside of Chicago, research-based hospitals and neurological rehab centers are located in major cities such as Phoenix, Seattle, Boston and Baltimore. Yale University is building one in New Haven, Connecticut.
USC’s plans call for 112 to 140 beds in a 250,000 to 300,000-square-foot facility to be built next to the university’s future, $300 million School of Medicine in downtown Columbia’s BullStreet District.
According to Amiridis, once built, the hospital and center would be financially self-supporting. Research would be reliant on federal funds from the National Institutes of Health, the leading source of medical research dollars in the country.
While the distribution of those funds has been called into question under proposed cuts by the Trump Administration, Amiridis said he is optimistic a compromise will be reached as the policy changes make their way through the court system.
USC expects to cut the ribbon on the medical school in summer 2027.
If the Legislature approves the funding, Amiridis said he would like to see the neurological hospital open a year later.",https://scdailygazette.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/GettyImages-512298231-300x200-1.jpg,,,2025-04-02 07:02:39.557458

(Whitney Downard/Indiana Capital Chronicle)A jam-packed agency bill became even more behemoth and wide-reaching on Tuesday after a Senate committee crammed in dozens of other provisions that largely deal with local taxes.
The move drew a range of questions from Democrats, all of whom voted against the merge. Some Republicans were also hesitant — and a GOP budget leader was opposed altogether. 
House Bill 1427, now more than 150 pages in length, was originally focused on Department of Local Government and Finance (DLGF) matters.

Embedded in the underlying legislation was language around DLGF rule-making, as well as administrative policy changes for various local taxes and assessments.
But a massive amendment approved by the Senate tax committee wrapped in all or parts of three other bills: House Bill 1080 and Senate Bill 304, dealing with innkeeper’s and food and beverage taxes, and Senate Bill 290, which mostly addresses local property tax levies.
Multiple other new changes and provisions — like for professional sports and convention center developments — were additionally included.
The amended bill advanced 8-5 to the full chamber, despite unfavorable votes from Democrats and top Republican Sen. Ryan Mishler, R-Mishawaka.
Sen. Eric Bassler, R-Washington, one of the bill’s Senate sponsors, discussed the amendment before the tax committee and expressed concerns, too. Because he is not a member of the committee, the senator did not participate in Tuesday’s vote.
“I’m always a little bit leery to have substantive policy changes for the state in agency bills. If the state is going to make a policy change, I’d rather those bills kind of be standalone language,” Bassler said.
“I think that’s even more so in this bill, because this is a 117-page amendment to a 79-page bill, and it deals with literally dozens and dozens of dozens of issues,” he continued. “I think we need to be very careful when we’re starting to change state policy in such a complicated bill.”
‘Substantial’ amendment prompts questions
Democratic Sen. Andrea Hunley, of Indianapolis, raised questions about a child care facility portion of the amendment that would create a partial property tax exemption for employers who provide child care for their employees on company property.
Hunley worried that the tax benefit would do little to increase services for parents, given it only applies to care for children under the age of six. Child care facilities that do not have a formal agreement with a business also would not qualify.
“To me, it’s not really solving the child care issue that we have … but it’s really about subsidizing businesses to provide a service to their own employees,” Hunley said.

“There’s so much in here dealing with taxes that are going to impact our local communities. And that has been a theme this session, in a variety of ways, and in a variety of pieces of legislation,” she added. “We have to think about — not just these pieces of legislation in isolation — but the myriad of ways that we are impacting locals with these policy changes.”
Mishler further took issue with a section on “professional sports development areas,” or PSDAs.
Those areas can already capture millions of dollars per year in tax revenue from sports facilities, hotels and other commercial properties fund infrastructure improvements and new sports-related developments.
Under the bill, cities that are located in a county with at least four cities — each with a population of at least 40,000 — would additionally be able to create special sports-related tax districts. Up to $2 million collected each year from the tax area could be invested in city-owned facilities that are used for “practice or competitive sporting events.”
“The PSDAs in here — those are usually budget discussions, because they reduce revenue,” Mishler said. “So, I’m a little irritated because I’ve been working with these groups on the investments that they’re bringing in there, and I feel like they just circumvented the system, went around, and just threw it in a bill.”
Bill author Rep. Craig Snow, R-Warsaw, told Mishler in response that he would be “happy to take anything out of this bill that you would like, because it’s kind of unwieldy.”
Mishler, the Senate Republican budget leader, foreshadowed possible changes to that language but did not provide details.
Contention around retirement community exemptions
Also in contention was a piece of the amendment that sets criteria for continuing care retirement communities (CCRCs), small house health facilities and residential care facilities” to qualify for tax exemptions.
Bartholomew County Assessor Ginny Whipple maintained that CCRCs should not qualify for exemptions “without going through the normal channels” already in place for properties.
Such senior living communities offer a range of services and care levels, from independent living apartments to assisted living and skilled nursing facilities, all under one roof.  
Currently, CCRCs can file for tax exemptions with the local property tax assessment board, whose members “vet their information and decide, on a local basis, who pays more taxes and who pays less” Whipple explained. She held that CCRC exemptions “should be a local matter, decided on the merits of each case.”










It's a step too far, in my estimation, for county assessors to take policy decisions as their purview.


– Senate tax committee chairman Sen. Travis Holdman, R-Markle


“I think each of these CCRCs are unique and individual. One size does not fit all. This bill would give them a free ride, while other folks over 65, paying their fair share, would not have that same advantage,” Whipple emphasized. “It would increase the taxes for those elders — because any time you carve out a special interest group, then you increase taxes for other taxpayers.”
Committee chairman Sen. Travis Holdman, R-Markle, gave a cold reply.
“I think there are two roles for elected officials: some elected officials are in the administrative, policy-setting role, and others are ministerial. The problem I have with assessors dipping their toe into policy issues — as I see assessors as ministerial functions in counties — yours is merely to execute the law as it’s presented to you,” Holdman said. “We appreciate your position, but you are not a policymaker in the county, according to my rules. … It’s a step too far, in my estimation, for county assessors to take policy decisions as their purview.”
Sen. Chris Garten, also on the tax committee, doubled down.
“I feel like we have a lot of assessors who are flippant. … Part of the issue we’re seeing is we’ve got elected assessors statewide — that when taxpayers call them to try to have a pragmatic conversation about property tax assessments — they flippantly respond and say, ‘Property taxes aren’t our issue. Call your state legislators,” Garten said. “The majority of assessors … should be focused on the administrative functions of the job, and not policy.”

Known in Oklahoma as SoonerCare and SoonerSelect, Medicaid provides health coverage to low-income Oklahomans, including pregnant women, children, elderly Oklahomans, people with disabilities, veterans and families in need. 
More than 900,000 Oklahomans — nearly 1 in 4 — depend on Medicaid to access the medical and behavioral health care they need.
As an OB-GYN with decades of experience caring for women and families in Oklahoma, I’ve seen firsthand what these programs have provided for so many families. 
Medicaid pays for 52% of Oklahoma births and covers 47% of all Oklahoma children. Thanks to Medicaid, I’ve seen expectant mothers receive access to critical prenatal care and postpartum support they couldn’t have afforded otherwise, ensuring better health outcomes for both moms and babies.
Medicaid plays a vital role in supporting the health and future of Oklahoma children. Children enrolled in Medicaid miss fewer school days, are more likely to graduate high school and become healthier adults. In a state where nearly half of our children rely on Medicaid, this is a lifeline we can’t afford to lose.
Every year, Oklahoma receives $7 billion from Medicaid, 68% of the federal funding sent to our state. Think of it as an investment that pays dividends through health care savings and continued reinvestment in the community through salaries, taxes and the purchase of goods and services. Patients on Medicaid who have access to primary and preventative care services are less likely to end up in the ER, where health care costs are far more expensive.
Losing even a fraction of Oklahoma’s Medicaid funding would create a substantial gap for our state and send a tidal wave through our interconnected health care system. When one part of the system fails, the issue doesn’t disappear — the burden is simply shifted elsewhere. 
Cutting Medicaid wouldn’t just hurt patients; it could be detrimental to access to care in our state. These funds are a vital lifeline for rural hospitals, many of which are struggling to keep their doors open. Further cuts could strike a fatal blow to these hospitals, negatively affecting not only the health of these communities but also their economy, as many potential employers consider health care resources when expanding into new areas. 
We can’t overlook the hardworking physicians who would take a hit if Medicaid is cut. Many of those who serve a larger number of Medicaid patients — such as pediatricians, OB-GYNS, psychiatrists and family doctors — work on slim margins, and if Medicaid is cut, doctors could be forced to close their practices altogether.
The health of our state is worth protecting. Continuing to invest in Medicaid is the best way to ensure Oklahomans receive the care they deserve.

(Photo by Baylor Spears/Wisconsin Examiner)Dane County Judge Susan Crawford was elected to the Wisconsin Supreme Court Tuesday, solidifying liberal control of the body until 2028 and marking a sharp rebuke by the state’s voters of the policies of President Donald Trump and the financial might of his most prominent adviser, Elon Musk.
Crawford rode massive turnout in Dane and Milwaukee counties and outperformed Kamala Harris’ effort last year in a number of other parts of the state to defeat her opponent, Waukesha County Judge Brad Schimel by about 11 points.
The former chief legal counsel for Democratic Gov. Jim Doyle who represented liberal groups such as Planned Parenthood and the Madison teacher’s union as a private practice attorney said during the campaign that she would look out for the rights of all Wisconsinites on the Supreme Court while repeatedly criticizing Schimel for his eagerness to show his support for Trump, his record as attorney general and the outside assistance his campaign got from Musk.
Crawford’s victory marks the third straight Supreme Court election for Wisconsin’s liberals and maintains the 4-3 liberal majority that has been in place since Justice Janet Protasiewicz was elected in 2023. Crawford will replace retiring Justice Ann Walsh Bradley.
Since gaining control of the Court, the new liberal majority has ruled that the state’s previous legislative maps were unconstitutional, ending the partisan gerrymander that had locked in Republican control of the Legislature for more than a decade, and accepted cases that will decide the rights of Wisconsinites to have an abortion. The Court is also likely to consider a challenge to Wisconsin’s 2011 law stripping most union rights from public employees within the next year or two.
“I’m here tonight because I’ve spent my life fighting to do what’s right,” Crawford said after the race was called for her. “That’s why I got into this race, to protect the fundamental rights and freedoms of all.”
Schimel said he got into the race because he was opposed to the “partisanship” of the liberal controlled Court but his effort to nationalize the race and show his support for Trump proved unsuccessful against a backlash to the second Trump term and voters’ distrust of Musk, who offered cash incentives for people who got out the vote for Schimel.
Tuesday’s election was the first statewide race in the country since Trump won the presidency last fall. Trump narrowly won Wisconsin and in counties across the state, Schimel failed to match the president’s vote total. In La Crosse County, Crawford performed 11 points better than Harris did last year and Schimel didn’t even match Trump’s vote share in his home of Waukesha County.
Schimel ran nearly even with former Supreme Court Justice Dan Kelly, who lost to Protasiewicz in the 2023 race. Wisconsin’s conservatives have now lost the past three Supreme Court elections by double digits.
The 2025 Wisconsin Supreme Court race set the record for the most expensive judicial campaign in U.S. history, topping the $100 million mark. While Crawford received support from liberal billionaires including George Soros and Illinois Gov. J.B. Pritzker, Musk dwarfed all other contributors, dumping more than $20 million into the race.

Musk’s money helped blanket the state’s airwaves with attack ads against Crawford’s record as a judge, often criticizing sentences she gave to people convicted of sexual violence. A Musk-associated PAC also hired people to knock on thousands of doors in an effort to turn out Trump’s base of Wisconsin voters, who have often sat out non-presidential elections. America PAC, a political action committee associated with Musk, paid door knockers $25 an hour, offered voters cash if they filled out a petition against “activist judges” and gave two people $1 million checks at a rally on Sunday.
“But I’ve got to tell you, as a little girl growing up in Chippewa Falls, I never could have imagined that I’d be taking on the richest man in the world  for justice in Wisconsin,” Crawford said. “And we won.”
In a concession speech delivered shortly before 9:30 p.m., Schimel told supporters they “didn’t leave anything on the field,” and when a few began to complain said “no, we’ve gotta accept this.”
“The numbers aren’t going to turn around. Too bad. We’re not going to pull this off,” he said. “So thank you guys. From the bottom of my heart. God bless you. God bless the state of Wisconsin. God bless America. You will rise again. We’ll get up to fight another day, it just wasn’t our day.”
The Democratic Party of Wisconsin, harnessing voters’ alarm at the actions Musk has been leading from his federal DOGE office to cut government programs and fire thousands of public employees, held People v. Musk town halls across the state where residents said they were worried about the effect those cuts would have on services they rely on like Medicaid, Social Security, veteran’s benefits and education funding.
Gov. Tony Evers said that Wisconsin “felt the weight of America” in this election, which proved Wisconsinites “will not be bought.”
“This election was about the resilience of the Wisconsin and American values that define and unite us,” Evers said. “This election was about doing what’s best for our kids, protecting constitutional checks and balances, reaffirming our faith in the courts and the judiciary, and defending against attacks on the basic rights, freedoms, and institutions we hold dear. But above all, this election was as much about who Wisconsinites believe we can be as it was about the country we believe we must be.”
Democrats and Crawford accused Musk of trying to buy a seat on the state Supreme Court, partially to influence a lawsuit his company, Tesla, has filed challenging a Wisconsin law that prohibits car manufacturers from selling directly to consumers. Musk said he was focused on the race because the Court could decide the constitutionality of the state’s congressional maps, which currently favor Republicans and help the party hold a narrow majority in the U.S. House of Representatives.
At the victory party, Democratic Party of Wisconsin Chair Ben Wikler compared the effort against Musk and Trump to Gov. Robert “Fighting Bob” La Follette’s fight against the oligarchs of the early 20th century, adding that Republicans’ association with Musk will be an “anchor.”
“I think what Susan Crawford did by making clear that Elon Musk was the real opponent in this race, what voters did by responding to Elon Musk, it made clear that Elon Musk is politically toxic, and he is a massive anchor that will drag Republicans from the bottom of the ocean,” he said. “And that’s a message that I hope Republicans in Washington hear as fast as possible. Not only will they lose, but they will deserve to lose resoundingly and they will be swept out of power in a wave of outrage across the nation.”
On the campaign trail, Crawford sought to tie Schimel to Musk — she called her opponent “Elon Schimel” at the only debate between the two candidates — while portraying herself as the less partisan candidate. Throughout the nominally non-partisan race, both candidates lobbed accusations of extreme political views at the other.
With Crawford’s victory and the retention of the Court’s liberal majority, the body is expected to rule on cases that ask if Wisconsin’s Constitution grants women the right to access an abortion, the legality of the Republican-authored law that restricts the collective bargaining rights of most public employees, how Wisconsin’s industries should be regulated for pollution and the legality of the state’s congressional maps.
Heather Williams, a spokesperson for the Democratic Legislative Campaign Committee, said in a statement that Democrats were offering a better vision for the country than the one promised by Schimel, Trump and Musk.
“Despite Republicans’ best efforts to buy this seat, Wisconsin voters showed up for their values and future,” Williams said. “While Trump dismantles programs that taxpayers have earned, support, and are counting on, voters across the country are turning to state Democrats who are delivering on promises to lower costs and expand opportunities.”

(Photo: Angela Dennis)The Trump administration on Monday abruptly suspended an estimated $8 million in federal grant funding that provides family planning, cancer screenings and preventative health care to low-income Tennesseans.
More than 30,000 Tennesseans have accessed healthcare through the impacted organizations since late 2023.
Planned Parenthood announced that nine of its affiliates — including the affiliate that funds Planned Parenthood of Tennessee and North Mississippi — were notified that funding under the Title X grant program is suspended until further notice. 
A spokesperson for the  U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) stated Tuesday that it is “concerned about the compliance of several awardees” receiving a combined $27.5 million in Title X funds. The department is assessing all Title X grant recipients for compliance with federal law and President Donald Trump’s executive orders. No final determinations have been made.
The Title X program has supported affordable basic health care, birth control, STI testing and treatment, and cancer screening for more than 50 years, Planned Parenthood of Tennessee and North Mississippi President and CEO Ashley Coffield said Tuesday.
Withdrawing Title X funds will drive up costs for people who already face barriers to access health care, she said.
“We’re going to hang on as long as we can and provide the care without having the reimbursement,” Coffield said. 
Trump administration targets Planned Parenthood’s family-planning grants

The notice of suspension also went to Mississippi-based organization Converge, Inc., which began receiving Title X funds in 2023 to provide Tennesseans with low- and no-cost reproductive health care. Converge has served nearly 12,000 patients through 33 health centers in Tennessee, according to the organization.
In a letter to Converge, HHS cited Converge’s public statement, “Our Commitment to Addressing Systemic Racism,” as grounds for compliance review based on civil rights laws prohibiting discrimination on the basis of race, color and national origin.
The department is also assessing compliance with executive orders, including President Donald Trump’s “Ending Taxpayer Subsidization of Open Borders” order barring publicly funded benefits to people without legal immigration status.
“Every day that there is a delay in Title X funding is a day that patients across Mississippi and Tennessee go without care,” Converge Co-founder Jamie Bardwell stated. “This will create a cascading effect across the South, disrupting access to basic health care services … These disruptions will lead to increased negative health outcomes, including higher rates of unintended pregnancy and STIs.”
HHS did not share a timeline for its compliance reviews. 
Converge will “comply with the requests outlined by HHS and demonstrate our adherence to this administration’s orders,” Bardwell stated. “People’s lives depend on it.”
Real people’s lives are going to suffer’
Title X funding has been distributed to the two organizations after the Tennessee Department of Health was kicked out of the program for violating the conditions of the grant by refusing to provide patients with “non-directive” counseling that included abortion after the state instituted an abortion ban. The state health department previously received roughly $8 million from the program.
In the 16 months that the organization has received grant funding, Planned Parenthood of Tennessee and North Mississippi has served 21,989 patients and logged 22,263 visits in Tennessee, Coffield said. The organization provides care on a sliding fee scale based on family size and income.
Planned Parenthood received $3.8 million last year to provide services in Tennessee, according to Coffield. Converge received just under $8.4 million in fiscal year 2024 to provide services in Mississippi and Tennessee, HHS records show.
The Title X grant funding cycle was slated to end March 31, with renewals beginning April 1. In previous years, organizations would have been told weeks in advance what funding level to expect for the coming year, Coffield said. Instead, they got the letter informing them of the funding freeze — the first correspondence they’ve received under Trump’s second administration.










It seems like the Trump administration and Elon Musk are appeasing their anti-abortion backers and targeting basic health care that has nothing to do with abortion. Real people's lives are going to suffer as a result. 


– Ashley Coffield, Planned Parenthood of Tennessee and North Mississippi


CHOICES Center for Reproductive Health, a Converge sub-grantee, operates a walk-in clinic in Memphis providing birth control, emergency contraception, confirmation of pregnancy and options counseling and HIV testing, in addition to other testing and treatment services.
“CHOICES is heartbroken to have lost critical Title X funding—funding that provides essential family planning and wellness services that are especially important in places like Tennessee, where we face a total abortion ban and an utter lack of maternal health care services,” President and CEO Jennifer Pepper stated, pledging to fighting for patient care.
Coffield said the freeze is causing unnecessary chaos, confusion and anxiety for patients.
“It seems like the Trump administration and Elon Musk are appeasing their anti-abortion backers and targeting basic health care that has nothing to do with abortion,” she said. “Real people’s lives are going to suffer as a result.”
Planned Parenthood of Tennessee and North Mississippi will work to continue providing affordable care without support from Title X funding in the event of permanent loss.
“We will do everything that we can to continue to help people get the care that they need, that it’s affordable, that they have the freedom to choose to come to the provider of their choice, and that they’re not forced out of getting basic care by the Trump administration and Elon Musk,” Coffield said.

(Photo: John Partipilo/Tennessee Lookout) A Tennessee Republican leading the effort to exclude some immigrant children from public schools has refused to rule out the possibility his bill could also force educators to report students to U.S. immigration authorities.
Sen. Bo Watson, a Republican from Hixson, is cosponsoring the legislation to require immigration status checks of every student at each one of Tennessee’s more than 1700 K-12 public and charter schools.
School districts would then have the option to deny children without legal status access to an education or charge their families tuition.
The bill’s language contains no requirement that schools report students without legal status to U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), but Watson told lawmakers Tuesday that was “something to be considered in the rules and regulations” the state Department of Education would develop should the bill become law.
The prospect drew immediate pushback from Sen. London Lamar, a Memphis Democrat.
“I think that sets a dangerous precedent for our schools, where folks go to schools to be protected, and now children are going to be subjected to be wrangled up by ICE officials if they can’t provide the appropriate documents,” said Lamar, one of two Democrats on the 11-member Senate Finance committee.

Lawmakers on the committee voted 7-4 to approve the measure, with two Republicans joining Democrats to vote “no.” Tuesday’s vote was the bill’s last stop in the Senate before it heads for a full vote on the floor.
The bill has yet to be reconciled with its House counterpart, which gives school districts the option – rather than the mandate – to check student immigration status, exclude children or charge tuition.
A statement by the Tennessee Immigrant and Refugee Rights Coalition called the bill’s advancement a “troubling step towards exclusionary policies undermining our public education system’s foundational principles of equality and access.”
A test case
If enacted, Tennessee would likely become the only state in the nation to deny students without legal status the right to a public school education.
Texas, Indiana, Idaho and Ohio are weighing similar school exclusion policies, but Tennessee is the only state in which a bill is actively moving through its legislature, according to the National Immigration Law Center.
The bill has drawn large and often loud protests as it winds its way through the legislative process, but Tuesday’s meeting drew a smaller and more muted turnout.
One protester, 80-year-old Lynne McFarland, was carried out of the Capitol by state troopers after she refused to leave voluntarily.
Tennessee GOP bills target public school education for immigrant children without legal status

Republican backers of the bill have said they hope it serves as a test case to overturn Plyler v. Doe, the 1982 Supreme Court case that established that all children have a constitutionally-protected right to a public school education regardless of immigration status.
Watson on Tuesday said that the legislation was necessary to address the rising costs of illegal immigration for Tennessee taxpayers, including a steep increase in state expenditures for English-Language Learner (ELL) instruction since 2016.
“The proposition is that we continue to increase exponentially the funding we are providing for ELL education, and I have long felt we need to have a conversation imposed upon the citizens in funding ELL,” Watson said.
“While ELL incorporates both documented and undocumented students, it is difficult or impossible to tease out the difference between the two, and I use ELL funding as at least a correlation of what may be occurring within the undocumented community,” he said.
Sen. Jeff Yarbro, a Democrat, said that in his Nashville district 80% of English language learners are U.S. citizens or legal residents. Yarbro argued the exclusion of children without legal status would do little to reduce ELL costs.










What’s the long term-cost of having a group of people who are, at the state’s direction, illiterate and just creating a long term underclass in society. That tends not to work well.


– Sen. Jeff Yarbro, D-Nashville 


Tennessee schools would also continue to receive consistent funding even if immigrant children are disenrolled. Gov. Bill Lee’s school voucher bill, enacted earlier this year, guarantees steady funding to schools experiencing enrollment drops.
Instead, Yarbro said, the state may incur greater costs by preventing children from attending school.
“What’s the long term-cost of having a group of people who are, at the state’s direction, illiterate and just creating a long term underclass in society,” he said. “That tends not to work well.”
A fiscal analysis of the bill noted it may also jeopardize over $1 billion in federal education funding to the state for violating federal civil rights law.
‘People, humans, only get to be 6 or 7 once’
Yarbro questioned why Republican lawmakers weren’t focused on enacting legislation that punishes employers who rely on immigrant workers if the aim of the bill is to reduce illegal immigration.
“Instead, we are in this legislation punishing kids. Children. For conduct that, regardless of what you think here, certainly isn’t the 6-year-old or 7-year-old’s fault,” he said. “People, humans, only get to be 6 or 7 once.”
GOP bill allowing Tennessee schools to deny an education to immigrant children advances

Yarbro also questioned the financial cost of requiring school officials to verify immigration documents of every student, noting the complexity of immigration law could prove challenging to local schools.
“If you talk to districts and think about what it means to convert all 1800 public schools into institutions that review the citizenship status of every student every year, that is going to be massively expensive,” he said.
Watson, however, noted that school districts already require parents and guardians to produce documents as a requirement for enrollment.
“I believe they’re already asking for this information and I believe the costs would be insignificant,” he said.
The House version of the bill, sponsored by Leader William Lamberth, a Portland Republican, is scheduled to be heard in the House Government Operations Committee. No date for the House hearing nor a Senate floor vote has yet been set.

Senate Bill 1425 sponsored by Sen. Richard Briggs, a Knoxville Republican, was rejected last week in the Senate Judiciary Committee, averting the effort to pass legislation enabling physicians to perform abortions for “fatal fetal anomalies” without the threat of being charged with “criminal abortion.” Rep. Esther Helton-Haynes, a Signal Mountain Republican, sponsored the House version of the bill to provide a new exception for abortions after the legislature outlawed the procedure three years ago.
In its place, the lawmakers are supporting Senate Bill 1004, which expands the conditions in which a woman could be at substantial risk for death or irreversible impairment, enabling her to have an abortion. It is set to go to the Senate floor for consideration.
  Rep. Bryan Terry, a Murfreesboro Republican and a physician, is sponsoring a bill that would allow doctors to perform an abortion if medically necessary to save a pregnant woman’s life. (Photo: John Partipilo/Tennessee Lookout)
The House Health Committee approved its version Tuesday on a 15-6 vote. Committee Chairman Bryan Terry, who sponsored the bill, assured lawmakers it didn’t provide new exceptions for an abortion but listed conditions doctors could use to determine whether a woman should end a dangerous pregnancy.
Terry, a Murfreesboro anesthesiologist, told colleagues that doctors could use the definitions to make a diagnosis and then decide whether an abortion would be medically necessary to save the mother’s life. All efforts would have to be made to save the baby, in keeping with the state’s abortion law. 
The Tennessee Medical Association supported the “fatal fetal anomalies” bill following an October 2024 ruling in Blackmon v. State of Tennessee in which a three-judge panel found that physicians may terminate pregnancies to save a woman’s life when she’s critically ill. The court also outlined the types of fatal fetal diagnosis that could qualify under the ruling after women who had to leave the state for abortion procedures filed suit.
The bill sponsored by Briggs and Terry, both Republicans, gives a clearer definition of the times a woman could receive an abortion, including “inevitable abortion,” a type of miscarriage in which the pregnancy ends and the uterus expels matter. It also includes any medically diagnosed condition that complicates a pregnancy to the point the woman could die from deadly problems such as ruptured membranes, “inevitable abortion,” severe preeclampsia and an infection that can result in uterine rupture or loss of fertility.
Because the matter remains in litigation, Briggs would say only that the bill headed to the Senate floor “complements” the court ruling.
Tennessee Medical Association lobbyist Julie Baker said her group was disappointed that the initial bill failed but called the replacement measure “a step in the right direction.” She was uncertain whether the group would push the defeated bill again next year, but said “fatal fetal anomalies” remain a problem, forcing women to travel out of state for abortions to avoid the risk of life-threatening pregnancies.

Other topics ran the gamut, from tax cuts and transgender sports to water resources and parental rights.
The voting measure, Senate Bill 10, would no longer allow students at Indiana’s public institutions to use their college IDs as proof of identity at the polls. But the reason seemed unclear — as sponsor Rep. Kendell Culp, R-Rensselaer, continually referred to “concern” that college students aren’t residents.
 Rep. Kendell Culp, R-Rensselaer, stands in the House chamber before session begins on Friday, March 8, 2024. (Leslie Bonilla Muñiz/Indiana Capital Chronicle)
“I think a lot of the concern here that we’re missing is: a university ID does not prove that that is an Indiana resident,” he said.
But Rep. Matt Pierce, D-Bloomington, noted there is an entirely different part of law that governs residency and voter registration. The bill doesn’t impact that law.
“We’re singling students out. If your concern is about registration, then deal with that,” he said.
Pierce and others noted that most college IDs meet the four requirements in state law: to have a name, photo, expiration date and to be issued by a state or federal entity.
Rep. Chris Campbell, D-West Lafayette, observed that U.S. passports are allowed as proof of identity at the polls, but don’t have addresses or even a state of residency on them.
“Who are these students voting for overall? I’m just going to be truthful. They are a threat. They are a threat to Republicans in this state,” said Rep. Renee Pack, D-Indianapolis.
But Rep. Matt Lehman, R-Berne, held up his driver’s license and listed things Hoosiers can’t do without it: buy alcohol, some cold medicine, fly on a plane.
“We already have created a system where you need one of these to do everything almost everybody over the age of 18 is doing,” he said. “I don’t think it’s too much to ask if you are going to vote to have one of these.”
Non-drivers can also obtain state identification cards.
The bill passed 67-24 and now returns to the Senate.
 Progress on income tax cuts
Hoosiers could see upcoming cuts to the state individual income tax rate under a different measure approved 74-18 in the House.
Senate Bill 451 would drop the rate by 0.05% beginning in 2030, if state general fund revenue collections exceed 3.5% growth in each of the four preceding fiscal years. The next year’s revenue forecast also must be at least 3.5%.
The reductions would continue in every even-numbered year through 2040.
Current law is phasing Indiana’s flat income tax rate down from 3.05% in 2024 to: 3.0% in 2025, 2.95% in 2026, and 2.9% in 2027 and years thereafter.
Each 0.05 percentage point reduction of tax rate would result in a decline of income tax revenues between $150 million to $200 million annually, according to a fiscal analysis for the legislation.
“It’s a hard bar to cross, but it would occur in those cases where state revenue is really growing,” said Rep. Jeff Thompson, R-Lizton.










The human existence is all about opportunity cost. When we forgo billions of dollars, we are making a decision to disinvest in the future.


– Rep. Greg Porter, D-Indianapolis


He added that “we gain as a state when we do this” because it attracts business and residents.
Rep. Greg Porter, D-Indianapolis, said Indiana’s coffers have already lost $6 billion since 2015, when lawmakers started slowly reducing the rate. The bill would mean billions more in revenue gone.
“The human existence is all about opportunity cost. When we forgo billions of dollars, we are making a decision to disinvest in the future,” he said.
Porter noted the state could afford things like a fully funded statewide Pre-K program or subsidies for paid family leave and child care if taxes weren’t continually cut.
The bill was changed in the House, meaning the Senate must accept the changes before it goes to the governor.
 House OKs economic development reforms
Transparency and entrepreneurship additionally highlighted a separate bill also passed in the House, on an 87-4 vote.
Senate Bill 516 establishes an office for entrepreneurship and innovation, an agenda item for Gov. Mike Braun.
But it also holds provisions taking aim at the IEDC, which has faced years worth of backlash from lawmakers and constituents alike over its secretive approach to economic development efforts like the Limitless Exploration/Advanced Pace (LEAP) District.

The legislation would require the quasi-public agency to tell local units of government and the State Budget Committee about acquisitions of more than 100 acres — whether it’s bought in one or multiple transactions — at least 30 days before those purchases close.
The bill also tasks the IEDC and the executives of communities that host innovation development districts — like one within LEAP — with annually compiling reports about the districts’ activities over the last calendar year.
And it lists what would be included: revenue received, expenses paid, fund balances, debt details, information on parcels within tax increment financing districts and the amounts locals receive in revenue-sharing agreements. The reports would go to the community’s fiscal body and to the Indiana Department of Local Government Finance.
The Senate has to accept changes to the bill or send it for final negotiations.
 Bipartisan support for water-related measures
The House unanimously approved two other bills dealing with water withdrawals.
Senate Bill 4 would require that developers of long-haul water pipelines — over 30 miles long and transporting more than 10 million gallons a day — must go to the Indiana Utility Regulatory Commission and seek certificates of public convenience and necessity.
 Rep. Ed Soliday speaks before a committee on Thursday, March 27, 2025. (Leslie Bonilla Muñiz/Indiana Capital Chronicle)
There are also strict permitting requirements for transferring water from one water basin to another.
“This deals with concerns as we have been building water policy,” said Rep. Ed Soliday, R-Valparaiso. “It’s a pretty important bill.”
Senate Bill 28, dealing with “significant” groundwater withdrawals of more than 100,000 gallons of water a day, also passed easily.
Rep. Shane Lindauer, R-Jasper, said the legislation is intended meant to head off disputes when water withdrawals might cause nearby well failures as the state continues to pursue water-intensive industries.
Both bills were changed in the House, so the Senate must accept the changes before they go to the governor.
 Parental rights bill headed back to Senate
A bill spurred by anger at the Indiana Department of Child Services over parental rights passed the House 69-24.
Lindauer said the bill recognizes that “parents have a fundamental God-given right to direct the upbringing of their children.”
Senate Bill 143 specifically requires courts to give deference to parental rights when disputes with government regulations occur.
During the committee hearing, parents from multiple counties told stories of having their children taken away due to alleged abuse but later being exonerated. In some instances, medical records of the children have been kept from parents.
The Senate has to accept changes to the bill or send it for final negotiations.
Senate grapples with amendments
Across the building on Tuesday, Senate Republicans batted away a series of Democratic amendments to a bill limiting transgender female athletic participation. 
Sen. J.D. Ford, D-Indianapolis, authored two identical amendments — one for high school students and another for college enrollees — that would bar officials from examining an athlete’s “bathing suit area … to determine the student athlete’s biological sex.”
“There is no evidence that this has happened in Indiana under the current law in place and I haven’t heard of any requirements in any other state,” said Sen. Stacey Donato. “I ask you to defeat this amendment.”
A fight challenge, musical moments and long meetings: Inside committee day at the Statehouse

Donato, R-Logansport, sponsored House Bill 1041, which would bar transgender female athletes from participating on college athletic teams aligning with their gender. The proposal is an expansion of the current ban on K-12 students. 
Republicans also beat back three other amendments to the bill: one establishing a grievance process for college students injured by the bill; one allowing a college to discipline students who make accusations; and another creating a student-athlete “bill of rights.” 
Only Donato, who read her brief rebuttals from a piece of paper, spoke on any of the amendments. All five were defeated on party-line votes. 
Two other bills encountered little opposition: one letting the Indiana Gaming Commission regulate bare-knuckle fighting and another granting students additional excused absences for 4-H or Future Farmers of America activities. 
The latter, House Bill 1660, now heads to the governor’s desk. 
“FFA and 4-H are important organizations that help prepare our youth to be successful adults,” Buchanan said. “As someone who has worked with FFA for many years, I have seen firsthand the great work these youth organizations have done in our communities across the state,” said Sen.

Photo by Jon KingIt’s probably the worst kept secret in Michigan politics: State Sen. Mallory McMorrow is running to be the state’s next U.S. Senator.
After more than two months of speculation and overt hints, McMorrow made it official Wednesday that she wants to replace U.S. Sen. Gary Peters, who will not seek reelection in 2026.
McMorrow stakes her claim as a new type of Democrat in her campaign video that takes not-so-subtle swipes at the current party leadership, mockingly referencing the “little paddles” Democrats used at President Donald Trump’s congressional address last month and disdaining “the same old crap out of Washington.”
While the outsider brand is nothing new in politics, the Royal Oak Democrat believes her own lived experience will resonate with Michigan voters disillusioned with the status quo.
“I graduated right into the recession. I had a great internship that did not lead to a job. I had tens of thousands of dollars in student loans. I spent a couple of nights sleeping in the backseat of my car. And what I know is that there are so many people who simply do not believe that the American dream is possible for them anymore,” McMorrow told the Michigan Advance.
In 2024, Democrats lost control of the U.S. Senate while Peters chaired the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee. Republicans hold a 53-47 advantage this term. Democrats managed to hang onto Stabenow’s seat in 2024, as now-U.S. Sen. Elissa Slotkin (D-Holly) narrowly defeated former U.S. Rep. Mike Rogers (R-White Lake). While Democrats hope to retake the upper chamber in 2026, Peters’ decision makes that task considerably harder for the party that will have to defend another open seat.

While McMorrow is the first Democrat to announce for the Senate seat, other potential rivals for the Democratic nomination include U.S. Rep. Haley Stevens (D-Birmingham), who Politico reported in February had hired additional staff for a possible run. Meanwhile, sources told The Detroit News that newly-elected U.S. Rep. Kristen McDonald Rivet (D-Bay City) is also considering a run.
A previous possibility, former U.S. Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg, took himself out of the running in March.
On the Republican side, Rogers has hinted at another run in 2026.
McMorrow’s announcement, including a website launch, comes at a time of deep discontent on the part of many Democratic voters, with a recent CNN poll of Democrats and Democratic-leaning independents finding the party with a record-low 29% favorability rating. 
However, McMorrow says her call for new leadership in the party is predicated on it being result-oriented.
“I’m not somebody who fights just for the sake of fighting and I think people get really sick of that as well,” McMorrow said. “Replicating what we see on the Republican side does not actually get us out of this mess.”
McMorrow has achieved a certain level of national recognition, largely based on her viral video moment in the Michigan Senate in 2022, when she spoke forcefully against transphobic comments made by state Sen. Lana Theis (R-Brighton Township). McMorrow’s campaign video highlights that speech in which McMorrow turned what had been meant as an attack on her into a critique of Republicans focusing on culture war issues at the expense of providing better roads and lowering healthcare costs. Her response drew praise from national pundits she received in its aftermath.
She also got a primetime speaking spot at the Democratic National Convention last year, lugging an oversize bound copy of Project 2025 and offering a warning of what it portended, which in retrospect seems rather prophetic. 
“If Donald Trump gets back into the White House, he’s going to fire civil servants like intelligence officers, engineers, and even federal prosecutors, if he decides that they don’t serve his personal agenda,” she said to the convention delegates. “They’re talking about replacing the entire federal government with an army of loyalists who answer only to Donald Trump.”

McMorrow’s goal now is to parlay that national reputation into a winning strategy for voters across Michigan, an argument she plans to make based on results she’s helped lead as the state Senate’s majority whip, the first woman to hold that position.
“We can point to things like expanded childcare. That we are on the path to universal pre-K, universal school meals, which I hear all the time from parents, more than the cost savings is the amount of time that it saves them to get ready and get their kids ready and out the door. Repealing the seniors retirement tax. We just have so much that we can show that we’ve done in Michigan and I want to take that into the U.S. Senate,” McMorrow said.
What she would prefer to offer is a vision of the American dream that cuts across ideological lines, which her ability to provide has been compared to another Midwestern state senator whose oratorical skills took him from the Illinois statehouse to the U.S. Senate, and ultimately the White House. 
And while McMorrow doesn’t claim to be the next Barack Obama, she does aspire to emulate his power of persuasion.
“Everytime I heard Barack Obama speak, I was inspired and I was inspired to do more. One thing he did, and does exceptionally well, is not let the listener be passive. There is an acknowledgment that we all have to work together.,” McMorrow said, adding that when Obama endorsed her state Senate candidacy in 2018, it was one of the most deeply moving days of her life.
“If I can make anybody feel the way that he made me feel, then we’re going to be better off,” she said.
McMorrow’s timing also comes just a week after releasing a book, “Hate Won’t Win: Find Your Power and Leave This Place Better Than We Found It,” a part memoir, part “how to” manual for affecting change at the local level, something she says voters are hungering for.
“I’ve got people coming out to my town halls and coffee hours and responding on my Instagram every week asking not what am I going to do to fight back but what they can do,” she said. “We need leadership who is going to bring them onto the team. I can’t fix the entire Democratic Party, but we can show through this campaign a very different way to run a campaign and hopefully change things moving forward.”
With her hat now in the ring, McMorrow has a marathon and a sprint ahead of her. The marathon is the race she’ll run between now and the Democratic primary in August 2026, with the sprint to the general election just three months later in November. Of course, that’s only if she wins the primary, something McMorrow says she isn’t taking for granted. Nor does she intend to make one pitch for the primary and another for the general.
“My message of a new American dream and opportunity, that’s going to be the same message I would have in a general election,” McMorrow said. “It is not in my nature to run one way in a primary and then turn around and run a different way in a general, because people will see right through that, and they should.”

(Zach Wendling/Nebraska Examiner)LINCOLN — The Legislature’s budget-setting committee appears likely to reverse a preliminary cut in state aid to the University of Nebraska recommended by Gov. Jim Pillen.
The nine-member Appropriations Committee decided Tuesday, the second day of considering whether to reverse the cut and instead increase NU’s state appropriation, to table the vote on the change for at least one more day until there was more “clarity.” That means a vote could come Wednesday on the university system’s annual “I Love NU Day” celebration at the Capitol.

Multiple committee members said NU President Jeffrey Gold and Pillen continue to discuss a path forward after the committee’s preliminary budget kept Pillen’s 2% cut in year-over-year appropriations, equating to a $14.3 million reduction in each of the next two fiscal years.
State Sens. Myron Dorn of Adams, Rob Dover of Norfolk and Paul Strommen of Sidney said their understanding is that Pillen and NU have settled at a 1.25% increase instead.
“I think we all agreed on the 1.25,” Dorn told the Nebraska Examiner.
Part of the change came after the three senators and committee chair State Sen. Rob Clements of Elmwood met with Pillen and continued talking with university officials.
‘Clarification’ needed before vote
State Sen. Ashlei Spivey of Omaha said NU needs at least a 2.5% increase each year, partly because of greater uncertainty in federal funding under President Donald Trump.
Dorn initially proposed a 1.25% increase for the next fiscal year, but Spivey questioned whether the deal that Pillen and Dr. Gold reached was for a 1.25% increase in each fiscal year. Such a deal would return the $14.3 million each year to NU with an additional $8.7 million in the first year, according to the legislative fiscal office.
If the second year were included, it would add $17.6 million to NU’s state-supported bottom line.

Gold, in a Tuesday evening call with the Examiner, said his understanding is for a 1.25% increase in each of the next two budget years. He said that would be “a world of a difference” from the 2% cut. This is Gold’s 12th year at NU but his first budget cycle as president.
Dorn, now in his seventh year on the committee, said NU never saw a decrease in his six years that NU faced a decrease because of the state’s projected $457 million budget deficit.
Pillen and NU disagreed over the university budget two years ago, when the governor, a university regent for almost 10 years and a University of Nebraska-Lincoln alum, proposed giving NU a 2% annual increase. NU at the time sought a 3% annual increase.
The committee and lawmakers ultimately landed at a 2.5% annual increase. 
This time around, the NU Board of Regents in August requested a 3.5% increase in state aid each fiscal year, which Gold said was largely to cover inflationary costs and some increased health care costs.
‘Budgetary holes’
Gold described this budget cycle as “normal.” The “wrench” that has come into conversation, he said, is “existential forces that are in play on the federal side of the equation.” He said NU hasn’t wavered from its mission to foster a future workforce and support agriculture and the medical and business communities.
Tuition and state dollars are the predominant legs of NU’s budget in a “delicate balance,” Gold said. But each state dollar invested, he added, is $1 less needed in tuition increases.
“In the interest of keeping higher education accessible and affordable, the changes that they’re proposing will be helpful,” Gold said.

Asked how the changes could impact students, Gold added: “The bigger the budget gap, the more seriously we have to consider tuition changes.”
Gold said the NU Board of Regents “had no clue” in August how much the future federal situation would impact NU. He said the evolving federal situation leads to rapid budget changes “both plus and minus every day” as cuts are implemented but later rolled back, frozen or put on hold via court order.
By the end of the day Monday, in preparation for committee deliberations on Tuesday, Gold said NU had tracked losing $34.4 million in federal grants, while another $1.9 million in grants had been put on pause. If a currently blocked federal plan to cap indirect costs paid to research universities and medical schools at 15% proceeds, NU would lose $27 million.
NU also receives $700 million in other grants or contracts, or about $58 million monthly. Some have been delayed, and some may catch up, Gold said. Still, holes are left in the meantime.
“I am very optimistic that that is going to be restored, because the importance of this research is critical to the economy of our country and quality of life of Americans,” Gold said. “But until it’s restored, it’s creating budgetary holes that we’re gonna have to dig out of.”
Of federal funding, State Sen. Machaela Cavanaugh of Omaha, an Appropriations Committee member, said: “We’ve got our heads in the sand, and we’re ignoring the massive cuts that President Gold is telling us the university has already been receiving.”
Clements said the federal cuts were why the committee reconsidered the state budget cut to NU at all.
Return on investment
NU’s cut was included in the committee’s preliminary budget in February, helping minimize the two-year projected budget shortfall down to $289 million. 
Restoring or expanding NU’s annual appropriations could grow the state deficit.
Cavanaugh said the committee has the funds and that the deficit doesn’t actually exist. She said the committee could use some of the $780 million in state funding set aside for tax credits to offset property taxes that local governments levy. Cavanaugh said the state could fund public schools directly or eliminate unfunded mandates to lower property taxes.

She said colleagues were making a choice to be in a deficit while the university needs appropriate resources to continue offering a world-class education at a reasonable cost.
“The priorities of the majority of the Nebraska legislative body are completely out of whack with what the responsibility is of government to provide a public good,” she told the Examiner.
State Sen. Christy Armendariz of Omaha said she continued to think NU should get a decrease in its general state appropriations because NU is getting $300 million for a health-centered project in Omaha. That appropriation would come over six fiscal years and is paired with private philanthropic dollars and would keep NU competitive in the medical and health fields.
Spivey said that commitment is separate and that the dollars aren’t flexible. She noted the state needs to invest in NU, which a recent economic impact study found annually adds $10 to the economy for every dollar spent on NU. Gold said the return on investment for every research dollar is greater, up to $16 returned.
University ‘going nowhere’
While he supported an increase to NU, Dorn noted that the state budget is a give-and-take for the budget and that if NU went up, something else might need to be cut.
  State Sen. Myron Dorn of Adams. Aug. 8, 2024. (Zach Wendling/Nebraska Examiner)
Gold said that in the face of the rising costs, NU remains a sure investment.
“The University of Nebraska is going nowhere, and our ability to return positively to the economy of the State of Nebraska is not going to change. It’s only going to grow over time,” Gold said. “To the extent that we cut the budget, that is just going to give the Appropriations Committee less funds to appropriate next year.”
The NU community will be out “in force” Wednesday for the annual celebration, Gold said, as he looks ahead to a day of gratitude. He said that next week regents will consider the “penultimate version” of a new strategic plan as part of the beginning of Gold’s presidency.
Gold has framed NU’s next era as an “odyssey to extraordinary.”
“I learned a long time ago: What’s good for the State of Nebraska is good for the university,” Gold said Tuesday. “We are very, very focused on building the future for the state.”

Attorney Stephanie Taub (right) of the First Liberty Institute also supported the bill. (Tess Vrbin/Arkansas Advocate)An Arkansas House committee approved a bill Tuesday that supporters said would protect religious freedom, a day after the Senate rejected a bill with a similar stated goal.
House Bill 1615 will be heard by the full House Wednesday after passing the Judiciary Committee on a split voice vote following nearly an hour of public opposition. The bill would “prohibit the government from discriminating against certain individuals and organizations because of their beliefs regarding marriage or what it means to be female or male.”
This would protect Arkansas government employees from adverse employment action if they refuse to do something within the context of their jobs that conflicts with their “sincerely held religious beliefs,” such as providing a marriage license to a same-sex couple, according to the bill.
House Bill 1669, which had similar language regarding the “sincerely held religious beliefs” of parents seeking to foster or adopt children in Arkansas, failed in the Senate Monday after passing a House committee, the full House and the Senate Judiciary Committee in March. The bill’s Republican sponsors, Rep. Mary Bentley of Perryville and Sen. Alan Clark of Lonsdale, said HB 1669 would ensure Arkansas does not join the ranks of states in which parents who do not accept or affirm LGBTQ+ children’s identities are not allowed to foster or adopt.
Sen. Jonathan Dismang, R-Searcy, said the bill would set a “dangerous precedent” by shielding foster or adoptive parents from adverse government action if their faith-based actions harm children. He reminded the chamber that not all “sincerely held religious beliefs” are Christian.

Fifteen Republican senators voted for the bill, which needed 18 votes to pass. Dismang and three other Republicans joined the chamber’s six Democrats in voting against the bill. Five more Republicans did not vote and four voted present. The Senate later expunged the vote, and the bill is on the upper chamber’s Wednesday agenda.
The original version of Act 733 of 2023 included language about foster care, adoption agencies and the issuing of marriage licenses similar to both HB 1669 and HB 1615. That legislation was amended to remove such specific language. Critics said it would not only empower anti-LGBTQ+ discrimination but also would contradict a similarly worded ballot measure that voters rejected in 2022.
Rep. Robin Lundstrum, R-Elm Springs, is the primary sponsor of Act 733 and HB 1615. Attorneys from the conservative First Liberty Institute and the Family Council’s Arkansas Justice Institute supported Lundstrum in presenting the bill to the House Judiciary Committee on Tuesday.
 Tuesday’s debate

Attorney J.P. Tribell was the only opponent of Bentley’s bill in the March 12 House committee hearing, but one of eight opponents of HB 1615 Tuesday.

“[There are] some rural counties where possibly everybody in the courthouse might be opposed to gay marriage, and if somebody wants to get a marriage license and they can find nobody, at what point do we determine that there’s an undue burden on the person seeking a marriage license?” Tribell said. “Do they have to drive two to three hours to get to Little Rock to do that?”
Civics educator Gail Choate said HB 1615 espouses the “opposite logic” of Act 116 of 2025, which all but one of HB 1615’s 13 sponsors supported. Act 116 prohibits public entities from engaging in identity-based “discriminination” or “preferential treatment” in contracting and hiring practices.
“This bill does not evaluate individuals based on their actions, their qualifications or their ability to contribute to society,” Choate said. “It singles them out solely based upon their identity.”
Other opponents of the bill spoke on behalf of themselves or their loved ones in the LGBTQ+ community. Kaymo O’Connell, a transgender high school senior from Little Rock, expressed concern about experiencing employment discrimination upon entering the workforce in the near future.
HB 1615 allows government employees who issue marriage licenses to recuse themselves from doing so. Marie Mainard O’Connell, Kaymo’s mother, said HB 1615 lacks a public notification process for such recusals.

“That’s where the harm occurs,” she said. “[People] are harmed when they expect to be cared for, and then they are told, ‘I don’t believe that about you, I don’t have to care for you that way.’ That creates a moment of trauma.”
Social workers Kirsten Sowell and Courtney Frierson said HB 1615 would create a conflict between their ethical codes, which include acceptance of LGBTQ+ people, and the fact that the state issues their professional licenses.
“If my licensing board receives a complaint based on someone’s religious disagreement with my inclusive care, who are they supposed to protect: me or the complainant?” Frierson said. “That’s a legal gray zone, and it’s not theoretical, it’s coming.”
No members of the public or of the House Judiciary Committee spoke in favor of HB 1615. Opposition on the committee primarily came from its Democrats, including Rep. Nicole Clowney of Fayetteville, who called it “blatant viewpoint discrimination.”
“We heard a lot of abstract ideas about religious freedom [today],” she said. “We did not hear from one person who is for this bill who is currently being persecuted.”

Photo by Baylor Spears/Wisconsin Examiner. Leaders of the Universities of Wisconsin and the state Department of Corrections (DOC) defended Gov. Tony Evers’ budget requests to lawmakers on the Joint Finance Committee during a meeting Tuesday. 
The hearing marks the start of lawmakers’ official work on the state budget, which will continue this week with public hearings in Kaukauna on Wednesday and West Allis on Friday. 
Sen. Howard Marklein (R-Spring Green) and Rep. Mark Born (Beaver Dam), co-chairs of the Joint Finance Committee, said during a press conference ahead of the meeting that they were looking for “justification” on the “massive” requests from the UW and wanted an explanation of the plan for DOC. 
“[The DOC request is] lacking in a lot of details and seems to be a little short of being able to accomplish its mission, but I’m interested to hear more about how they arrived at that and why they made some of the decisions they made and hopefully provide some information that will allow us to improve that plan and make sure that it’s a good plan for the future of the Wisconsin Department of Corrections and for public safety here in Wisconsin,” Born said. 
In the past, lawmakers have heard from a greater number of agencies about their requests. During the last budget cycle, lawmakers heard from four agencies, including DOC, the Department of Transportation, the Department of Safety and Professional Services and the Department of Administration. That year, state Superintendent Jill Underly traveled to Eau Claire to talk to lawmakers about the Department of Public Instruction budget after not getting an invitation to speak. 
The lawmakers said it would have been a “waste of their time and our time” to hold briefings with other agencies.
“[The agency leaders] just have not been straight with us on things. They just don’t want to really talk about what they’re doing and why they’re doing it,” Born said. He said lawmakers were hopeful that the UW and DOC would work with them to answer some questions. 
Universities of Wisconsin President Jay Rothman told lawmakers during the briefing that he agrees with Gov Tony Evers’ assessment that this will be a “make it or break it” budget for the UW system. Evers’ request for the UW includes an additional $856 million, which would be one of the largest investments in the university campuses in state history. 
Rothman acknowledged that the request is “significant” but he emphasized that Wisconsin currently sits at 43rd out of 50 when it comes to state investment in public universities. The investments in the request would bring the system up to the median nationwide. 
Rothman explained to lawmakers that inflation and a lack of state investment over the last three decades to meet increasing costs has hindered the UW system. 
UW schools have worked to make changes, he said. When he started as president in June 2022, Rothman said 10 of the system’s 13 campuses were running fiscal deficits. That number is now six and should hit zero over the next year or so. He also noted there have been six two-year colleges that have closed or will close this year.
Rothman called the reforms necessary and said that the changes position the system for sound investments from the state. 
“We have to be asking ourselves a question: who will teach our children and grandchildren? Where will the nurses come from that will help care for our families and perhaps ourselves? Where will the engineers come from?” Rothman told lawmakers.
Rothman explained that the proposals seek to address five goals including increasing affordability, accessibility, developing talent, ensuring quality and investing in innovation.
“You cannot cut your way to success,” Rothman said. “You need to invest.” 
Rep. Tip McGuire (D-Kenosha) asked Rothman what would happen if the state did not fund the requests. 
“If we get the budget funded, we will not have to raise tuition. If we don’t get funded at an adequate level, that’s one of the levers… that I don’t want to have to use,” Rothman said. “I want to be able to maintain the accessibility that our students get, but we will do what we need to do, and it won’t be just one piece. That will be multiple levers, and we get more efficient in some places. We have to stop offerings, programs at certain universities.”
Republican lawmakers grilled Rothman on “administrative bloat” across the system and requests for additional positions and funding from the UW schools. 
The budget request would add 214 positions funded by state general purpose revenue to UW campuses. Rothman noted that UW campuses, excluding flagship UW-Madison, have lost 6,000 positions funded by the state since 2019. 
Born asked why there was a request for 13 additional staff members to support students who have aged out of the foster care system. He noted that a 2023-24 report found there were 420 of those students across the system. 
“I’m trying to wrap my head around — you talked about strategic investments, sound investments, and you’re asking for 13 positions, one on every campus to serve 420 kids?” Born asked. 
Rothman said the intention would be to expand the number of students who could be supported. 
“They’ve had a tough lot in life to start with,”  Rothman said, adding that the additional staffing  could give those students a leg up. “I would hope that we could expand that number.” 
Rothman also said that the specific request is part of the general goal of investing in students to ensure they make it to graduation. 
“If you look at the positions that we have asked for, they are all student-facing. We are trying to help our students be successful,” Rothman said. 
“This is a shining example of the governor’s desire to grow government and your desire to grow your system, and it’s not focused on the reality of how you invest in this stuff,” Born said. 
Born also focused on the idea of funding new programs on UW campuses. 
“Why would we need to fund a curriculum of the future? Isn’t there things that are fading away, things that are no longer of interest to students, things are no longer of interest to the workforce? Shouldn’t there be funds available to offer new things?” Born asked. 
Rothman said that the UW system has cut about 100 programs already. 
“So you’ve eliminated about 100 programs, but you can’t fund a new program and curriculum and AI without more funding?” Born continued. 
“I think the fact of the matter is if we had kept up with inflation in terms of our state support, we’d be in a different position,” Rothman answered. 
Corrections budget 
DOC Sec-designee Jared Hoy also defended Evers’ proposals during the hearing, saying that policy changes, increased investments and capital projects are needed to improve safety in facilities across the state. The proposal, Hoy said, is “not simply a list of funding requests” but is a “blueprint for the future” of state corrections. 
Under the proposal, the state would invest about $634 million in the DOC. The majority of the money would be used to fund major reforms throughout the state’s prisons including infrastructure upgrades and capital improvements to Waupun Correctional Institution, Lincoln Hills School, Stanley Correctional Institution, Sanger B. Powers Correctional Center and John C. Burke Correctional Center. The improvements would culminate in the closure of the Green Bay Correctional Institution. 
Hoy told lawmakers that the budget proposal was developed through conversations with DOC staff, legislators and outside experts with a focus on “safety for those in our communities and the people that work in our facilities every day.” 
The proposal also includes some policy changes meant to help limit recidivism, including by expanding access to workforce training and substance use treatment for people who have 48 months or less left in their sentences for nonviolent offenses.
“A system that prioritizes re-entry and release, but fails to reduce recidivism is not truly safe. A facility that contains individuals but is dangerous and unstable inside its walls is not safe,” Hoy said. “Safety must be both measured by what happens inside the walls of our facilities, and by what happens when a person releases into the community.”
Hoy said that he hoped lawmakers would see some of their thoughts and ideas for the agency reflected in the plan.
“The governor’s budget request is an opportunity for our state to come together and use our taxpayers’ money responsibly to help keep our children and our communities safe,” Hoy said.
The idea that some lawmakers have floated of building a new facility would take significantly more time and money, he added. 
“Our agency does not have time to wait 10 to 12 years for a new facility to be built,” Hoy said.

(Dan Koeck/For the North Dakota Monitor)The North Dakota Young Republicans filed a resolution urging lawmakers to study child exploitation by public officials in wake of former Republican Sen. Ray Holmberg’s prison sentence.
A federal judge last week sentenced Holmberg to 10 years behind bars after the former senator pleaded guilty to traveling abroad with the intent to have commercial sex with minors. Holmberg was a state lawmaker for over four decades, and held the powerful position of Senate Appropriations Committee chair.
House Concurrent Resolution 3037, sponsored by Rep. Nico Rios, R-Williston, asks the statehouse to look for ways to prevent future crimes against children by government officials.
Brandon Prichard, chairman of the North Dakota Young Republicans, said the organization decided to propose the resolution after reading a sentencing memo filed by a federal prosecutor last month that alleged Holmberg had a pattern of exploiting boys and young men. Defense attorney Mark Friese denied many of the allegations in the memo and said there’s no evidence Holmberg had sex with minors.

Prichard said the Young Republicans were appalled by what they read and thought it necessary to take action this session to set the stage for legislative reform down the line.
“We can’t fix the world overnight,” said Prichard, a former Bismarck lawmaker.
The resolution was passed by the House Delayed Bills Committee last week. It’s scheduled for a hearing before the House Political Subdivisions Committee on Thursday at 9 a.m.
It calls on Legislative Management to research a host of policy changes.
The proposal suggests that lawmakers explore mandatory reporting requirements for public officials, for one. It also asks that legislators study creating a body within the Attorney General’s Office specifically for investigating allegations of child exploitation by public officials.
The proposal recommends looking at instituting stronger penalties for public officials who “engage in, enable or conceal” crimes against children, as well. This could include creating new mandatory minimum sentences, removal from office, loss of retirement benefits and disqualification from holding public office in the future, it states.
The resolution says that the study ought to include a review of what other states have done to address these issues.
The study should also examine ways to protect victims, witnesses and whistleblowers who report child exploitation, the proposed resolution states. At the end of the interim session, lawmakers would put together a report including any recommendations and legislative proposals for the 2027 legislative session.

(Justin Sullivan | Getty Images)Under an emerging Republican plan to require some Medicaid recipients to work, between 4.6 million and 5.2 million adults ages 19 to 55 could lose their health care coverage, according to a new analysis.
The study, conducted by Urban Institute researchers with support from the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation, calculated that up to 39% of the 13.3 million adults in that age group who became eligible for Medicaid when their states expanded the program under the Affordable Care Act would lose coverage if Congress required states to impose work rules.
The report suggests that most of those people would lose coverage not because they aren’t complying with the rules, but because they would struggle to report their compliance to the state.
“Most adults who would lose eligibility for federal Medicaid funding are working, engaged in work-related activities, or could qualify for exemptions not readily identifiable through state databases but could still face disenrollment because of the reporting requirements,” it states. The study identified several barriers to reporting, including lack of broadband access and lack of transportation.
Forty states plus the District of Columbia have expanded Medicaid under the ACA. Overall, nearly 72 million people, about a fifth of Americans, are enrolled in the program for low-income people, which is funded jointly by the federal government and the states.
Traditional Medicaid insurance was mainly available to children and their caregivers, people with disabilities and pregnant women. But the ACA, commonly known as Obamacare, allowed states to extend coverage to adults making up to 138% of the federal poverty level — about $21,000 a year for a single person.
Nationwide, more than 21 million people with low incomes have health insurance because of expanded Medicaid eligibility.
U.S. House Republicans in February pushed through a budget plan, now under consideration in the Senate, that would require about $880 billion in cuts to Medicaid over the next decade to help cover the cost of $4.5 trillion in tax cuts. The budget doesn’t contain specifics on how that target would be met. But work requirements are a likely money-saving option: A 2023 analysis from the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office found that imposing work rules on Medicaid recipients ages 19 to 55 who are not parents or caregivers would cut federal spending by an estimated $109 billion over the next 10 years.
The Congressional Budget Office based that projection on a plan the GOP-controlled U.S. House approved in 2023. That bill, the likely blueprint for the work requirements Republicans are considering now, would have required adults ages 19-55 to work, participate in a job training program or perform community service for at least 80 hours per month for three or more months in a calendar year. Parents and caretakers of dependent children, and those unable to work because of a health condition, would have been exempt.
Many Republican-led states are eager to impose work requirements on able-bodied Medicaid recipients. Thirteen states received permission to impose work rules on at least some Medicaid enrollees during the first Trump administration. Nine additional states requested permission to enact Medicaid work requirements during Trump’s earlier term but had not won approval by the time it ended.
When the Biden administration came into office, it rescinded all the approvals.
Supporters say requiring Medicaid recipients to work, study or train for a career gives them a boost toward self-sufficiency and financial stability. Critics, however, say such rules end up hurting far more people than they help.
The researchers from the Urban Institute mostly based their analysis on the experience of Arkansas, which in June 2018 became the first state to require some Medicaid recipients to work, volunteer, go to school or participate in job training to receive benefits. By the time a federal judge halted the policy in April 2019, 18,000 adults had lost coverage.
The researchers also looked at New Hampshire, which began implementing a work requirement but halted the program in July 2019 before suspending anyone’s coverage.
“What was found in a lot of qualitative research on the previous work requirement programs is that a lot of people were unaware of the policy, or they didn’t understand the policy,” said Michael Karpman, an Urban Institute researcher who co-authored the study.
“People who need coverage the most would do the most to try to maintain it. On the other hand, those people could also face the most difficulty with the administrative barriers,” Karpman said.
In a 2020 study examining how Arkansas’ last experience with work requirements played out, researchers from the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health “found no evidence that the policy succeeded in its stated goal of promoting work and instead found substantial evidence of harm to health care coverage and access.”
Arkansas Republican Gov. Sarah Huckabee Sanders announced in January that she would ask the federal government for permission to institute work requirements, regardless of what Congress decides. The state submitted the request last week.











Especially for a rural state like Arkansas, work requirements fail to take into account a lot of the realities that people may face.


– Christin Harper, policy director for Arkansas Advocates for Children and Families



Arkansas Republican state Rep. Aaron Pilkington, who serves on the health committee in his chamber, said lawmakers “learned our lesson from the last go-round.”
Pilkington said that under the new proposal, the state will only pause coverage instead of canceling it, giving recipients an opportunity to prove they are complying. And, he said, the online portal for reporting will be a lot more user-friendly.
“I think it’s a reasonable thing to ask for able-bodied people to look for work, or try to obtain work,” Pilkington said.
But Christin Harper, policy director for Arkansas Advocates for Children and Families, said even the new version would be a challenge for many enrollees. Many people on Medicaid are juggling multiple jobs, and having to report to the state every month would be a significant burden.
“Especially for a rural state like Arkansas, work requirements fail to take into account a lot of the realities that people may face,” Harper said. She added that “with the overall job market, job opportunities may or may not be available in some of these rural towns.”

Patrick Morrisey addresses the public during his first State of the State speech on Feb. 12, 2025, where he called to eliminate diversity, equity and inclusion programs in the state. (Perry Bennett | West Virginia Legislative Photography)We have just 11 days left of the legislative session, and 26 bills have made it to the governor’s desk.
The success of the Legislature isn’t based on how many bills it passes — it’s if those bills are helping West Virginians.
Let’s start with the good bills.
Senate Bill 283 would require students to take a personal finance class in order to graduate high school. I’m not a fan of the Legislature dictating what schools should be teaching — they don’t even know their own governing body’s rules — but this is an important life skill. 
Not everyone’s family will teach them how to budget or how to file taxes, or even how to write a check. Some of us are “blessed” with anxiety (I’m talking about me), and are cautious with our spending. Some people are more laissez faire and might spend, spend, spend and not worry about savings or paying bills when they first start out on their own. Honestly, it’s surprising that schools haven’t already been teaching some sort of personal finance — it’s not all just common sense.
Senate Bill 8 also does some good. It provides additional sites and devices for newborn safe surrender. These are sites where someone can drop off a baby without any legal repercussions for abandonment. 
It would also be good if the Legislature passed a few bills that offered more support to people with kids. They could help make child care more affordable and widely available, and ensure parents have paid parental leave.
There are already almost 5,900 children in foster care, and I don’t see the Legislature doing anything to try to get those numbers down. Which brings us to the bills that harm, not help West Virginians. Those include bills that make voting more difficult and eliminate ranked-choice voting (which already wasn’t a thing in West Virginia).
And we can’t forget the transphobic legislation — Senate Bill 456, which is described as a bill to define “men” and “women,” but really is just putting a target on transgender people’s backs.
The House is also considering another anti-LGTBQ+ bill that could soon be on its way to the governor. The Senate has already passed Senate Bill 579, which would cancel out local municipalities Fairness Acts. 
That’s right, the party of “small government” is pushing for a bill that would prohibit city councils and county commissions from establishing their own nondiscrimination ordinances because the state won’t pass its own. 
One West Virginia Republican thinks that racism isn’t a problem anymore.
“I don’t know where this came from, this idea that we are a racist country, that we don’t give equality to women or to different religions or whatever the case may be,” said Sen. Scott Fuller, R-Wayne, in support of banning diversity, equity and inclusion in state government. “Does [racism] exist? I’m sure it does. This is not a perfect world, we don’t live in a perfect society, but to the point that it’s a problem? I really don’t believe it.”
The Republican Party is keeping discrimination alive and strong in West Virginia by passing these bills that target LGBTQ+ people, refusing to pass the Crown Act and eliminating DEI initiatives. 
Democrats in both the House and Senate have introduced bills for the Crown Act. Why are Republicans so scared to make discrimination based on hairstyle and texture illegal?
How can anyone say that diversity, equity and inclusion are bad things? What’s so terrible about inclusion? Senate President Randy Smith is the sole sponsor on the bill for Gov. Patrick Morrisey’s executive order. Governor, please tell West Virginians what it is specifically you don’t like about diversity. 
DEI programs have benefitted white women as well as LGTBQ+ people, veterans and people with disabilities. I often hear people say they think that DEI leads to less qualified people getting a job over the most qualified white male candidate, and that’s just not the case. 
In other words, those programs have helped West Virginians. That’s the West Virginia I want to live in — where we help each other and not hate each other.

(Chase Woodruff/Colorado Newsline)It’s been three months since members of the 119th Congress were sworn in on Capitol Hill, and the U.S. Senate, especially, has been busy in the early days of President Donald Trump’s second administration.
 
Connecting the news in Colorado to the big picture.

A total of 41 Trump appointees have now been confirmed by the Republican-controlled upper chamber, including 21 out of 22 Cabinet-level positions. The Senate also passed a controversial short-term spending bill to fund the federal government through September, enacted new detention requirements for undocumented immigrants accused of certain crimes and repealed a handful of Biden-era rules and regulations.
With Republicans holding a 53-47 Senate majority, Democrats don’t have the votes to stop most of Trump’s agenda. But liberal and progressive activists have pressured Democratic senators, including U.S. Sens. Michael Bennet and John Hickenlooper of Colorado, to do more to erect procedural hurdles, slow down Senate business and vote in blanket opposition to Trump nominees as a protest against the executive branch’s unprecedented power grab. The administration’s actions have included mass firings of federal workers, purges of prosecutors involved in criminal proceedings against Trump, and attempted funding freezes and agency shutdowns that run contrary longstanding separation-of-powers principles.
When it comes to Senate floor votes, neither Hickenlooper nor Bennet has heeded the activists’ calls. They have been among the Senate Democrats most likely to back Trump’s Cabinet picks, voting to confirm eight and 10 nominees, respectively, out of the 21 selected so far.

A more comprehensive database tracking 2025 Senate votes, including votes on lower-level appointees, procedural motions and legislation, tells a similar story. The tracker, maintained by Massachusetts-based progressive organizer Jonathan Cohn, tallied 155 votes by the full Senate through March 27.
When collated with 2024 election results, this vote data shows a clear, unsurprising pattern: Senate Democrats representing swing states are more likely than those in safe blue seats to cross the aisle and back Trump’s nominees and legislative priorities. For example, Sen. Ruben Gallego of Arizona — elected narrowly in a state that Trump won by more than 5 percentage points last year — has voted with Republicans on almost 33% in 2025, while Sen. Elizabeth Warren of deep-blue Massachusetts has done so just 3% of the time.
The single biggest exception to this rule? Colorado and its moderate Senate duo, who have voted with Trump and their GOP colleagues roughly a quarter of the time while representing a state that voted for former Vice President Kamala Harris by 11 percentage points in the 2024 election.

Through the end of March, Hickenlooper — who is serving his first six-year term and up for reelection in 2026 — has been the Democratic caucus’ number one outlier, voting with Trump’s agenda almost twice as often as would be expected, based on the state’s electorate. Bennet ranks sixth out of 47 Senate Democrats by the same metric.
In comparative terms, the Centennial State finds itself in 2025 with the electorate of true-blue Illinois, but the Senate representation of purplish-red Arizona. No other state with two Democratic senators has such a large disconnect between its partisan vote share and its Senate representation. No other state besides New Hampshire even comes close.
As Democrats and independents across Colorado have begun mobilizing in recent months to oppose Trump’s agenda, their disconnect with Hickenlooper and Bennet has been on full display on social media, at town halls and demonstrations and in a daily deluge of calls and messages to the senators’ offices.
Bennet has defended his votes to confirm some Trump appointees — including Secretary of State Marco Rubio, Interior Secretary Doug Burgum and Energy Secretary Chris Wright — on the grounds that maintaining good relationships with leaders of important executive-branch agencies will help his constituents more than a stance of blanket opposition. He’s also argued that Democrats, after being “repudiated” in the 2024 election, have to “select our battles.”
 A rapid political evolution

If such messages no longer resonate the way they once did with Colorado’s Democratic base, it’s largely because of the state’s rapid political evolution in recent years.
Both of Colorado’s senators entered state politics more than 20 years ago — Hickenlooper as a successful restaurateur elected mayor of Denver in 2003, and Bennet, a friend and fellow Wesleyan University graduate, as his chief of staff. At the time, Colorado was a traditional battleground that had veered to the right: Attorney General Ken Salazar was the only statewide Democratic elected official in a state otherwise dominated by Republicans.
As recently as 2016 — when Hickenlooper and Bennet were in their second terms as Colorado governor and U.S. senator, respectively — Colorado had tilted towards Democrats but could still lay claim to bellwether status, with Republicans like former U.S. Sen. Cory Gardner able to win narrowly in favorable conditions for the GOP. But Trump’s rise abruptly ended that: In the last eight years, Democrats have gone 15 for 15 in statewide elections, winning their races by an average of more than 10 percentage points.
Much of that shift has been driven by voters in fast-growing cities and suburbs along the Front Range. Younger, left-leaning voters have moved to the state in droves. In 2024, even as Democrats lost ground in many states across the country, the party fared relatively well in Colorado, maintaining wide leads among suburban voters and even making gains in more rural areas on the Western Slope.
Political alignments like this don’t last forever. But in an era of nationally polarized politics, Trump has tanked the GOP’s electoral fortunes in Colorado, and for now, a wide gap — partly generational, partly ideological, but perhaps above all attitudinal — has opened up between the state’s two senators and many of its voters.
“Everyone out here, everyone I know — moderates, hardcore left people — they want someone who will fight,” Greeley resident Robert Casey told Bennet at a recent town hall. “And we need that.”

Andy Beshear appeared before a joint session of the House and Senate on Jan. 8, 2025 to deliver his State of the Commonwealth address.  (Kentucky Lantern photo by Arden Barnes)This article mentions suicide. The number for the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline is 988.
Changes the Kentucky General Assembly ordered in Medicaid face an uncertain future after Gov. Andy Beshear said lawmakers failed to fund the legislation.
For the second year in a row, Beshear last week sent the House and Senate a letter listing bills that they had passed without providing what Beshear said was the necessary funding. 
Beshear sent the letter on the next to last day of the 2025 session, listing 11 bills and writing “there is still time in this legislative session to add appropriations.”
  Senate President Robert Stivers (LRC Public Information)
The Republican-controlled legislature took no action in response to the Democratic governor’s letter, and Senate President Robert Stivers, R-Manchester, told reporters Beshear is obligated to carry out laws as enacted by the legislature.
“He wants to make some excuse about, ‘oh, you didn’t give me the money.’ But it’s basically: ‘yes, you do have the money. Find it within your budgets,’” Stivers said.
Among the 11 bills that Beshear said lack “the appropriations necessary to implement” them  is House Bill 695, which directs the Beshear administration to take steps to enact a Medicaid work requirement while prohibiting the administration from making any changes in the $15 billion program without first receiving the legislature’s approval. The bill also creates a Medicaid Oversight and Advisory Board to look for cost savings in Medicaid.
Beshear vetoed the bill and the legislature easily overrode his veto.
The clash comes as Democrats in Washington are bracing to fight Republican efforts in Congress to cut Medicaid — a federal-state program that covers health care for low-income people — in order to pay for renewing federal tax cuts.
In the letter, Beshear said HB 695 would require rebidding Medicaid managed care contracts, which he said would cost the state $1.4 million, including hiring a contractor to help develop the request for proposal. The bill also is estimated to cost $500,000 in state funds to conduct a managed care long-term service study, Beshear wrote.
In his veto of HB 695, Beshear said the Medicaid community engagement requirement, commonly called a work requirement, would “undoubtedly” cost some adults their health coverage and also spark costly litigation challenging the requirement.
  Emily Beauregard
Emily Beauregard, the executive director of Kentucky Voices for Health, said health care advocates are concerned about new costs associated with a work requirement. “One of our concerns all along with HB 695 has been the additional administrative cost it requires to ultimately provide less health care, which isn’t a good use of taxpayer dollars,” she said. 
Beshear’s letter to lawmakers last week echoed one he sent the year before, which has sparked a lingering controversy over the state’s failure to fund relief for kinship care families. 
Lawmakers have previously said Beshear has misinterpreted a 2005 state Supreme Court decision that he says precludes the executive branch from spending money the legislature has not appropriated. That decision came out of a cycle when the General Assembly passed no budget. 
Still, Beshear wrote: “These holdings are simple: if the legislature creates a  policy or program  but does  not  provide  funding,  it  does  not  intend  for  the  executive  branch  to  perform those services over the biennium. The omission  of  an  appropriation  is  the same  as  its elimination.” 
Beshear also cited a more recent federal court decision.
 
On Friday, Stivers criticized Beshear’s handling of the kinship care issue, which resulted in months of back and forth with no solution for families who are raising minor relatives and need more assistance. 
“He decided to expand Medicaid rolls, not do kinship care, but then he says he doesn’t have the money to do it,” Stivers said. “He picks and chooses what he wants to do, even though we’ve told him what to do.” 
“We’ve talked about on this floor all the things he decided to fund without authority, things he does without authority. We send him bills, and it’s his obligation to carry out those laws that we change and empower him to execute on,” Stivers said. 
Most of the funding for Medicaid comes from the federal government. Beshear said 1.6 million Kentuckians are covered by Medicaid and the Children’s Health Insurance Program.
Beshear’s letter to lawmakers also said they had failed to take into account the costs of their decision to protect conversion therapy. House Bill 495 overrules restrictions Beshear had placed on the discredited practice and also prohibits Medicaid from covering transgender-affirming medical care. Beshear estimated it would cost $540,000 to $1.95 million in state funds.
‘Flabbergasted:’ Help for kinship care families passed unanimously. $20M price tag could derail it.

“Other states with similar laws have experienced an increase in suicide attempts, some by as much as 72%,” Beshear wrote. “The increase in services expected include an additional six hours of behavioral health counseling and therapy, an increase in pharmacy costs and increased psychiatric hospitalization.” 
Among other bills Beshear said the legislature failed to fund:

Senate Bill 4, which he said would cost at least an estimated $2.5 million to operate a centralized registry of artificial intelligence systems in state government and implement an AI governance process.
House Bill 390 to set up an accessible online vehicle insurance verification system, which Beshear said would cost $600,000 to $1.1 million initially and then $750,000 a year to operate.

Beshear also said that House Bill 346, exempting emergency temporary internal combustion engines from paying an emissions assessment fee and to retroactively refund some fees would cost the Division of Air Quality $1 million in expected revenue from fees.

In 1987, the company was the state’s second-biggest manufacturer. But over time, Fruit of the Loom began closing plants and moving production to lower-wage countries like Honduras, Haiti and Vietnam. By 2014, all production in the state was gone.
 These plant closings were devastating for laid-off workers and their communities. And they were the result of a bipartisan consensus around trade that prioritized the bottom line of powerful corporate interests above all else. President Donald Trump has long recognized the public anger from such trade policies and is now using it to impose high and blanket tariffs on imports.
While selective tariffs can make sense as part of an industrial policy targeting strategic sectors, the chaotic, broad-based policies the president has rolled out threaten to weaken the economy, raise prices for consumers and harm Kentucky industries without helping address the nation’s enormous trade deficit.
The era of a growing U.S. trade imbalance began in the 1970s with deregulation of the international flow of capital. The trend grew with passage of the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) in 1994 and greatly accelerated when China joined the World Trade Organization in 2001.
Between 2000 and 2010, Kentucky lost a net 100,000 manufacturing jobs in total, one-third of what we had 10 years earlier. The state lost an estimated 45,400 net jobs directly from the China shock and at least 12,100 from NAFTA. Especially hard-hit was employment in computer and electronic parts, metal products and machinery, apparel, furniture and textiles.
Politicians and many economists claimed these changes would be good for all of us. But while consumers got cheaper goods from Wal-Mart, towns were hollowed out, families went bankrupt and deaths of despair rose from drugs, alcohol and suicide. Proponents said the government could always compensate those who lost jobs with financial assistance and retraining. But the money never came, and the training was often a dead end.
Meanwhile the big winners from the shift of jobs overseas were Wall Street, which attracted foreign financial investment from the overvalued U. S. dollar; manufacturing companies that made higher profits off cheaper labor in other countries; and corporations that weakened American unions by using the threat of closure to frighten organizing efforts and win concessions.
There are smart ways to change course and use industrial policy — including selective tariffs — to address the yawning trade deficit and make things better for domestic and foreign workers. Policies could help support strategic industries like autos, steel, energy and semiconductors through public investment, research and development, and union-partnered workforce training in addition to targeted tariffs.
That can help bring back more manufacturing to the U. S., needed not just for jobs but because of its proven linkage to innovation and to build more resilient supply chains that were so clearly lacking in the pandemic. At the same time, we can engage in mutually beneficial trade while better conditioning access to U. S. markets on protection of labor rights and the environment in other countries, helping improve what are often horrifically exploitative working conditions.
But that’s not what is being rolled out. The on-again, off-again and blanket nature of the new tariff policy is creating economic uncertainty that is slowing consumer spending and business investment. The us-against-the-world nature of the tariffs and the bullying trade war stance are already hurting U. S. exports that are facing retaliatory tariffs in industries like Kentucky bourbon. High, comprehensive tariffs can also further increase the value of the dollar and make Kentucky-made products that contain foreign inputs more expensive, hurting U. S. manufacturers and farmers further.
And the cost of tariffs is likely to be passed down to consumers at a time when many are rightly concerned about inflation and the unaffordable prices of basic household goods. At the same time, the administration’s domestic policies are weakening workers’ bargaining power through attacks on unions and undermining the public investments needed in an effective jobs policy by gutting vital federal agencies.
Failed trade policies have created the political room for what the president is now doing. It will take recognizing the ways this policy is the wrong answer to the right question to discover what Kentuckians truly need.",https://kentuckylantern.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/steel-workers-1024x683.jpeg,,,2025-04-02 06:00:31.318280

(Photo by Michael Salerno/Rhode Island Current)Denise Robinson’s role at the Rhode Island Department of Transportation (RIDOT) has changed dramatically since she started 36 years ago. New technology and updated government regulations require constant expansion of her job as a record keeper on state construction projects. 
But her job classification, “engineering technician IV,” has never been upgraded to reflect her growing workload — a problem faced by many of her coworkers and fellow members of the RI IFPTE Local 400, she said.
“They constantly create new things for us to learn; just expect us to adjust with no compensation,” said Robinson, president of the union representing about 300 engineers at RIDOT and the Rhode Island Department of Environmental Management. “And because our pay grades are so off from surrounding states, we can’t attract people to open positions.”
The union began negotiating in January 2024 with the Rhode Island Department of Administration to reclassify some of its members at higher pay grades based on seniority, performance and expanded duties. But the required public hearing needed to make merit-based changes for classified state workers — separate from annual cost-of-living adjustments —- has been on hold for nearly as long.
The state administration puts the blame on a major state software transition that includes its payroll system as reason why it can’t hold the hearings, and in turn, grant raises. The planned upgrade to a cloud-based system does not reflect any serious technical problems with the existing payroll software.
It has also not prevented 11 state department heads from receiving proposed raises within a month (barring formal action from the Rhode Island General Assembly to stop it). Among the cabinet members Gov. Dan McKee wants to give a raise to is RIDOT’s Peter Alviti Jr., whose 2% increase would put his annual base salary at $192,000. That’s more than double the $93,000 Robinson earns, according to the state’s payroll database.
A March 26 public hearing on cabinet raises drew opposition from local union leaders who represent state workers, including Robinson.
“I am not against anybody getting a pay raise, I just want it to be fair and equitable,” Robinson said in a later interview. “Why do my members have to keep suffering because you people don’t have your sh*t together.”
Robinson estimated “hundreds” of classified state workers spanning the state health, education, health and human services departments were not able to negotiate for and receive merit increases for the last year due to the software upgrades. She was unsure of the exact number.
  Under Gov. Dan McKee’s proposal, Rhode Island Department of Transportation Director Peter Alviti Jr., shown entering the House chamber for McKee’s State of the State on Jan. 14, 2025, would receive a 2% pay raise, bringing his base salary to $192,000 a year.

Bad timing
Karen Greco, a spokesperson for the Department of Administration, confirmed in an email that the administration “paused” public hearings on large job classification and pay grade changes during the transition to a new, cloud-based software system. The pause began May 2024 — directly following annual cabinet-level pay raises — and was lifted in March, just in time for the 2025 hearing on department head raises.
Hearings for raises for lower-level state employees like Robinson will happen “later this spring,” Greco said. She did not give a specific date.
Asked how many people were affected by the delays, Greco answered, “Public hearings are held to evaluate job classifications to determine if occupational standards have evolved over time. It is about evaluating positions, not people.”
She declined to say how many positions were affected, noting agencies and local unions were still submitting requests. 
Matthew Gunnip, a case worker with the Rhode Island Department of Children, Youth, and Families and president of SEIU Local 580, called on the directors slated for raises not to accept them until their employees also received merit-based increases.
“It’s not about who deserves an increase or not, it’s about timing,” said Gunnip, who represents 850 state workers across DCYF, the Department of Human Services and the Department of Behavioral Healthcare, Developmental Disabilities and Hospitals, among others. “It feels contradictory that the priority of a director’s salary be more important than frontline workers.”

Greco said that proposed raises for department heads can happen only in March of each year under state law. Public hearings for classified state workers in any agency can happen at any time, and there is “no statutorily prescribed cadence.”
Meanwhile, the cost and time to complete the long-awaited modernization of state payroll, finance and other software systems — referred to as the Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) project —- are growing. McKee proposed revising the state’s current year, fiscal 2025 budget to include $15.8 million more for the project, bringing state spending on the project to $84.5 million, according to a March 21 budget amendment. McKee’s fiscal 2026 budget proposal allocates another $6.7 million to the project for a total cost of $91.2 million.
Transitioning the payroll system from a smattering of individual programs and, in some cases, paper timesheets, to a universal, cloud-based system is now expected to happen by September — nine months later than the original January target. The state plans to return to a regular public hearing schedule for state worker reclassifications once the transition is completed, Greco said.
The explanation puzzled Patrick Crowley, president of the Rhode Island chapter of the AFL-CIO.
“If they didn’t need the software for department head raises, why do they need it for the rank and file?” Crowley questioned. “I don’t understand that.”

Embracing the modern era
Rhode Island Department of Administration Director Jonathan Womer explained during a March 25 hearing before the Rhode Island House Committee on Finance.
“This is about the time it’s taking us going through 50-plus collective bargaining agreements and rules and regulations around payroll, primarily for employees and how complicated it is to document and put in the system,” Womer said.
Womer insisted it was still a worthwhile and long overdue project, despite repeated increases in the bottom line and completion date.
“We don’t have enough modern controls over our finances and financial transactions,” Womer said. “We have been relying on typewriters and carbon papers for a long time.”
The state’s Division of Enterprise Technology Strategy and Services in a 2019 report called the software transition “less of an opportunity and more of a necessity.” At the time of its strategic plan laying the framework for the transition to a universal cloud system, Rhode Island was one of 12 states that lacked a modern cloud software system, six of which had already begun to implement one, according to the report.
The report highlighted benefits for efficiency, transparency and security, the latter of which was compromised by the aging and uncoordinated systems used by various agencies to track spending, contracts and other financial information.
“The more touchpoints, the more opportunities for malicious actors to exploit weaknesses,” the report stated. “A breach of HR, payroll or financial data has massive economic and reputational costs and consequences.”
Sage advice, especially on the heels of a December 2024 cyberattack on the RIBridges public benefits system, which compromised personal information of up to 650,000 residents.
An audit of the state’s fiscal 2024 financial statements published on March 26 found 28 “material weaknesses” and “control deficiencies” across state agencies deemed of “critical importance” to address by the state auditor general. The administration in its written response to these findings said the ERP system would address many of these deficiencies, according to the report
Of the increasing price tag for the ERP project, Womer said it was “mostly due to having contracts there longer.”










We don’t have enough modern controls over our finances and financial transactions. We have been relying on typewriters and carbon papers for a long time.


– Jonathan Womer, Rhode Island Department of Administration director


A bulk of the funding, $55.5 million with McKee’s proposed budget adjustment, comes from a state account reserved for IT projects based on revenue from selling state land and buildings. A separate restricted receipts account using revenue derived from Division of Motor Vehicles service charges also covers part of the project costs.
Even so, Rep. Alex Marszalkowski, a Cumberland Democrat and second vice chair of the House Committee on Finance, questioned Womer about the rapidly rising cost amid a $250 million forecasted budget deficit for the upcoming fiscal year.
“Now, more than ever, we need to be able to control the controllables,” Marszalkowski said in a later interview. “That’s why you’ll hear me say over and over that projects need to come in on-time and on budget.”
Especially because lawmakers had the same discussion with the administration last year during budget deliberations. 
“We asked them then, ‘what are we doing to ensure this is being rolled out on time?’” Marszalkowski said.
When government IT upgrades fall flat
Delays and rising costs plague government IT projects, including for ERP systems. And completing the software transition doesn’t guarantee results; as few as 13% of large government IT projects succeed, according to a field guide by the U.S. General Services Administration.
In Idaho, a $121 million transition to a similar cloud-based software system called Luma led to payroll issues and failure to properly distribute $100 million in interest payments to state agencies. Since Maine debuted a $30 million software upgrade for its child welfare system in 2022, case workers continue to criticize the program as cumbersome and laborious to use.
Many of the reported problems related to state workers’ abilities to understand and use the new system, a challenge Rhode Island tried to head off by hiring a contractor to train state workers on implementation and usage. The $6.2 million purchase order with Houston-based IT consultant Precision Task Group Inc. was awarded through a competitive bidding process in 2022, the same time as the primary $37.6 million purchase order to Boston-based Accenture LLP, which is providing the subscription to a software called Workday, according to state bidding award documents.
The existing contract for Accenture runs through Sept. 30, while the agreement with Precision covers through the end of 2025.
A third purchase order based on a bid awarded last summer to Deloitte Consulting LLP allocates $600,000 for the consultant to “support the existing payroll team” in transitioning from the current payroll program, ADP, to the new cloud program, Workday, according to the bid documents. Deloitte is the same vendor hired to administer the RIBridges program hacked last year.
Greco sought to separate the work Deloitte was hired to do for the ERP system from its role as the administrator of the RIBridges contract.
“They are not building or managing the system; they are accountants helping with the transition,” she said of the new software contract. “RIBridges is a wholly different project with a completely different scope of work. It’s inaccurate to conflate the two.”
Senate Finance Chair Lou DiPalma, a Middletown Democrat who works as a technical director for Raytheon, was unconcerned by Deloitte’s involvement in the software project.
But he was not assured by the state’s explanation that the ERP project was the reason why state workers’ pay raises had been put on hold. DiPalma was not aware of the situation prior to being interviewed by Rhode Island Current. 
“That should not be the case,” he said. “If they need to do something with regards to appropriately compensating somebody, technology should not be the means by which it is delayed.”
Marszalkowski was similarly uninformed about how the project was affecting public hearings for worker reclassifications. 
“If I had known that would have been one of the first questions I asked during the hearing,” he said.
Robinson has asked leaders of the Department of Administration, multiple times, she said. 
“They’re not willing to give an answer,” she said.

(Photo by Markus Schmidt/Virginia Mercury)The Virginia General Assembly is set to reconvene Wednesday for what will likely be a long, one-day session that’s equal parts policymaking and political theater, as lawmakers face off over Gov. Glenn Youngkin’s sweeping amendments to 159 bills — including major changes to the state budget.
Youngkin finished acting on all 915 bills sent to him during the 2025 session by last week’s Monday midnight deadline. He signed 599, vetoed 157, and sent back 159 with recommended changes — including a staggering 205 proposed amendments to the budget bill, House Bill 1600, and eight item vetoes.
While many of the vetoes — including on bills to create an adult-use cannabis retail market, raise the minimum wage, allow public-sector unions and tighten how the Virginia Department of Elections processes voter registration data — were expected, none are likely to be overridden. That would require a two-thirds majority in both chambers, and Democrats hold only slim leads: 51-49 in the House, and 21-19 in the Senate.
Governor unleashes veto storm to drown progressive legislation

Instead, the real legislative drama lies in how lawmakers will handle the governor’s amendments — especially those to the budget and several controversial policy bills that set the stage for a partisan clash that could shape not just legislation, but the narrative heading into this fall’s critical gubernatorial and House of Delegates elections.
Stephen Farnsworth, a political analyst from the University of Mary Washington, offered a candid assessment of Virginia’s current legislative dynamics this year, characterizing both the regular and Wednesday’s veto session as exercises in political positioning rather than substantive governance. 
“This was a kick-the-can-down-the-road legislative session, and it will be a kick-the-can-down-the-road veto session,” he said. 
According to Farnsworth, lawmakers from both sides are focused on shaping narratives ahead of the November elections rather than crafting major policy shifts. 
While he expects the veto session to be largely uneventful — “Veto sessions are usually anti-climactic as long as there is general overall agreement on the shape of the budget, and for the most part there is” — he acknowledged that some amendments might slightly nudge legislation in Youngkin’s favor.
One such example Farnsworth pointed to was the governor’s initiative to explore making Oak Hill, the historic residence of President James Monroe in Fairfax County, a state park. He noted the unusual nature of the proposal, given the region’s political leanings and spending patterns. 
“Republicans don’t often say ‘let’s spend money in Northern Virginia,’” Farnsworth observed, adding that some Democrats might find the idea more palatable than expected: “There might be some Democratic lawmakers who might say it’s easier to say yes to this than no.”
One example of a proposal that is expected to be caught in limbo, however, is HB 1923, which seeks pay parity for midwives. Rather than sign or veto the bill, Youngkin proposed an amendment requiring the Health Insurance Reform Commission to assess the issue and added a reenactment clause — meaning the bill would need to pass again in 2026 to become law.
Youngkin signs several maternal health bills, tweaks another on unconscious bias training

On the matter of cultural competency and unconscious bias training, Youngkin is once again pushing back. For the second year in a row, he’s offered an alternative to Senate Bill 740 by Sen. Mamie Locke, D-Hampton, and HB 1649 by Del. Cliff Hayes, D-Chesapeake, which would require medical professionals to complete such training to renew their licenses.
As in 2024, Youngkin’s proposed substitute eliminates references to “unconscious bias” and “cultural competency,” replacing them with language focused on serving populations with high maternal mortality and related health disparities. His version also caps the training at two hours.
While Youngkin has expressed support for expanding access to doulas, his amendment to HB 1614 by Del. Adele McClure, D-Arlington, and SB 1418 by Sen. Lashrecse Aird, D-Petersburg,  which would allow up to 10 doula visits to be covered by state health insurance, raised eyebrows by changing “birthing people” to “birthing women.” 
Supporters argue the original language was meant to be inclusive, since it reflects the fact that transgender and nonbinary people may become pregnant, groups which Youngkin’s edit excludes.
Youngkin also revised HB 2724 by Del. Charniele Herring, D-Alexandria, which regulates the use of automatic license plate recognition (ALPR) technology. While the bill originally limited data retention to 21 days, his amendment extends that to 30 — a modest expansion that still keeps a firm deletion requirement.
The bill strictly regulates how law enforcement can use ALPR data — only in criminal investigations, missing persons cases, and tracking stolen vehicles or wanted individuals — and requires state approval of all such systems.
In the realm of data centers, Youngkin amended HB 1601, sponsored by Del. Josh Thomas, D-Prince William, loosening requirements for environmental and noise assessments. 
The original bill required a detailed site analysis before new high-energy -use facilities (HEUFs) could be approved. Youngkin’s version makes that optional for localities and adds flexibility for examining other environmental impacts. He also clarified that the bill wouldn’t take effect unless reenacted in 2026 and wouldn’t interfere with local zoning powers.
Youngkin’s most sweeping changes come in the budget, where he rolled back major Democratic spending priorities.
Youngkin tweaks state budget with eye on federal cuts, but embraces key spending

He also cut $20 million from a proposed rental assistance pilot and removed $15 million designated for a first-time homebuyer grant program. His amendments further eliminate $138 million allocated for school support staff, along with $25 million for HVAC upgrades at Nottoway Correctional Center.
He revived a previously rejected proposal to allocate $25 million for private school scholarships, which would offer $5,000 vouchers to 5,000 low-income families to use toward nonpublic education — a move critics say siphons resources from public schools.
Democrats had proposed tax rebates to return about $1 billion to Virginians. Youngkin pushed instead for structural tax changes, including eliminating the unpopular car tax and exempting tips from taxation — both ideas that were rejected by the legislature.
Still, Youngkin embraced a core Democratic initiative by proposing to make 20% of the Earned Income Tax Credit permanently refundable. Without that change, the enhanced refundability is set to expire in 2027.
He also added controversial language that would withhold state funding from local law enforcement agencies that fail to cooperate with U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE).
Not all of Youngkin’s recommendations were partisan flashpoints. He agreed to send out tax rebate checks — $200 for individuals and $400 for joint filers — and backed bonus payments for public workers. Teachers would receive $1,000 bonuses, while state employees would get 1.5% bonuses on top of their already approved 3% raises starting July 1.
The Democratic majority has the numbers to reject many of Youngkin’s amendments without triggering a budget crisis. Thanks to Virginia’s biennial budget system, state funding is already in place for the fiscal year that begins July 1. However, any budget item rejected by the legislature could still be vetoed individually by the governor.
And Wednesday’s session may not be the last word on the budget. Lawmakers could reconvene later in a special session to address unforeseen federal impacts, such as layoffs or funding cuts, under the terms of a resolution passed earlier this year.

(Photo by Jim Morrison for the Virginia Mercury) For months, Norfolk City Manager Pat Roberts has been warning that Norfolk needs state help funding its $2.66 billion storm risk plan or it will not move forward.
Norfolk’s partnership with the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers requires a local share of $931 million over 10 years for nearly nine miles of floodwalls, natural solutions like grasses and oyster reefs, and raising houses to protect against billions in damages from a major storm.
Norfolk officials signal changes are necessary for floodwall to move forward

 So far, the state has contributed nearly $50 million over two years to the project, half the annual amount sought by the city. There is no money for it in the state’s 2026 budget. Federal funding rules require localities to pay 35% of such projects.
Meanwhile, feasibility studies by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers are moving forward for Hampton and Newport News, Northern Virginia, and Virginia Beach, where a draft plan recently has been shared with the public and the price tag is expected to dwarf the Norfolk cost.
But the commonwealth has no plan for what projects to fund and how. Now, one is in the works. Del. Phil Hernandez, D-Norfolk, and Del. Michael Feggans, D-Virginia Beach, successfully shepherded House Bill HJ 434, through the General Assembly. The measure, which did not need Gov. Glenn Youngkin’s approval,  authorizes a three-year study by the Joint Legislative Audit and Review Commission to create a methodology and criteria for state contributions to the local share of federal coastal storm risk management projects like the one approved by Norfolk and in the pipeline elsewhere.
The idea is to give local governments some certainty as they consider the multibillion-dollar partnerships with the U.S. Army Corps. 
“I don’t want to say there’s no rhyme or reason, but there’s certainly not a structure that everyone has sort of agreed upon, and that really is the genesis of this kind of analysis,” Hernandez said. “Knowing that you are going to get a dedicated revenue stream for a certain number of years to help you get across the finish line is tremendously valuable and gives you confidence to move forward at the local level.”
Hernandez said the study will look at the best practices in other states. For Norfolk, which is further along than other cities because it’s signed a partnership agreement with the Army Corps, the study is a lifeline. “Under the status quo, we really don’t have any place to go as a local government to help us with the resources that we need,” said Bryan Pennington, Norfolk’s director of government relations. 
“We hope that they will be able to expedite the conclusions of the study because right now all Virginia local governments are effectively at a competitive disadvantage with all other local governments across the United States because we haven’t clearly articulated what the state’s role is on these federally-funded flood mitigation projects.”
A state policy and fund dedicated to the projects gives localities confidence as their capital improvement budgets evolve to include infrastructure storm risk projects requiring hundreds of millions of dollars.
“Where is this money going to come from?” said Mary-Carson Stiff, executive director of Wetlands Watch, a nonprofit based in Norfolk. “If we don’t have a reality check on what future-proofing Virginia’s communities from big storms is going to cost us, then we can’t do the appropriate budget planning that’s necessary to set us up for success in Virginia.
“Once the analysis is completed, our communities will have a better picture of what resources the state is willing to expend to support local projects, and that will then help local governments make difficult decisions about whether to move forward or not, and if they decide to move forward, where will the additional resources come from?” she added. 
Will cities pass bond referendums? Will they enact additional taxes or fees to fill the gap? “These are the types of conversations that our local governments need to be having with their leadership to see if they can afford these types of projects, and then they also need to be having them with the community members if they are going to request that community members pay a share for the protection that the project will provide,” she added. “The reality is that the future will require taxpayers to start paying for these projects if they want to stay living in a high-risk place that’s protected from big storms.”
Pennington noted that Norfolk unsuccessfully requested $50 million this session to cover half of its local share. “We do not have sufficient revenue authorities to raise the funds that are required to unlock this $2.6 billion project,” he said. “Yet we proceed, and we go every single year, asking to the best of our abilities for a reasonable appropriation from the General Assembly because we simply have nowhere else to go.”
Hernandez anticipates there will be ongoing discussions about the funding policy for storm risk plans before the study’s conclusion. The Norfolk project is moving toward the beginning of construction, and the Virginia Beach project is approaching the conclusion of the feasibility study. 
“We’re going to have to think critically with the next governor’s administration to try and work toward that policy, even if we refine it in the coming years because 2028 (when the study is due) is too far out to do nothing,” he said. “These projects are moving forward. We cannot stall out. I don’t want Norfolk to be in a spot where we’re first in line right now and don’t figure it out and are not supporting the project and that makes it go sideways.”
The bill requires JLARC to not only examine what other states are doing, but prioritize projects with nature-based approaches and address socioeconomic inequities.
Those issues have surfaced in Norfolk, where the storm risk plan is the largest infrastructure project in Norfolk’s history. Of the threatened waterfront cities in the U.S., Norfolk is ahead with plans to combat rising waters. The City Council approved a partnership agreement with the Army Corps in 2023, passing an additional resolution promising to seek half its share from the state. 
Residents of the city’s lower-income, largely Black Southside, last year challenged the failure to provide them with floodwalls, noting their home values have been depressed by historical redlining. Critics have long said the benefit-cost analysis used by the Corps values property over people and grey infrastructure over green solutions to the detriment of disadvantaged communities and the environment.
A year later, residents of a wealthier neighborhood on the other side of the Elizabeth River raised the opposite objection. They saw concrete walls rising 11 feet or more through their historic neighborhood as a threat to their enjoyment of the waterfront and lowering their property values.
Stiff notes the focus on nature-based solutions and inequities mirrors recent changes in Army Corps policies promoting green solutions and considering social vulnerability, not just property values, when determining whether the benefit-cost analysis of a project justifies more expensive flood protection measures like concrete floodwalls. It’s unclear whether those focuses will continue under the Trump administration.
The JLARC requirements, Stiff said, are a reminder that resilience doesn’t encompass only protection from a major storm, but from the day-to-day disruptions of tidal flooding and rain bombs created by the climate crisis. “There are alternative ways to protect that may be more agreeable to the public and/or may provide multiple benefits,” she added. “We’re so laser-focused on the protection against big storms, but we forget that we have to be the ones to live with the project once it’s completed, and if the project is only there for the big one and it doesn’t do anything else for us as a community, then it’s a short-sighted or lost opportunity investment.”
The costs for projects like Norfolk’s plan likely will rise, Hernandez acknowledged, and so will any potential state contribution. Without the project, the 2019 Corps plan estimated that all but a sliver of the city’s interior would be at risk for flooding from a major storm by 2075. With the project, the feasibility study says Norfolk will reap annual net benefits of $122 million from reduced damage to businesses, homes, and critical infrastructure, including healthcare facilities.

(Photo by Ian Stewart for The Virginia Mercury)During fiscal year 2024, almost 11 million riders rode the bus in Richmond, or used paratransit, or LINK Microtransit services, according to the Greater Richmond Transit Company, an increase of 14% percent over last year. That boost is almost certainly due to GRTC’s zero-fare program that has allowed people to catch rides for free. 
But the program, which started during the pandemic, may be eliminated this summer, if a funding gap isn’t closed.
To spur corporations and the public into action, the non-profit advocacy group RVA Rapid Transit released a report last week at the University of Richmond’s Queally Center. 
Called, “Free to Move: The Role of Zero-Fare Transit in Advancing Health and Justice in Richmond,” the report breaks down the history of zero-fare, the demographics of riders and how the funding gap could damage ridership.
 ‘The need for accessible transit is urgent’

Faith Walker, executive director of RVA Rapid Transit, said her group spoke to 100 bus riders about how zero fare transit plays a critical role in their lives. Their report shows a funding need of $6.8 million for next year.
“The report clearly outlines the impact of fare free public transit, connecting individuals to jobs, health care, education, and essential services,” she said, “while contributing to reduced carbon emissions and more sustainable urban development. The need for accessible transit is urgent and we must act now to sustain and expand this vital service.”
The need Walker spoke of is a daily reality for Aqiyla McMillan, who has been riding the bus for more than a year, after her car broke down and an injury also sidelined her from driving. 
“I had a surgery, so I had to start getting around, getting to doctor’s appointments, getting to physical therapy, getting the kids to school,” said McMillan. “So I got on the bus one day thinking I had to pay and they were like, ‘Oh, no, the bus is free.’”
McMillan said not having to pay for the bus on a regular basis has been a lifesaver.
“I would have never been able to do that if there was fare on the bus,” she said.

 Where funding comes from 

The transit service gets funding from a variety of sources, including state and federal grants. Separate funding injections come from nearby localities and from the Central Virginia Transit Authority. But these funding sources help cover GRTC’s entire budget, not just the zero-fare program, according to spokesperson Ashley Potter.
A state grant of $8 million from the Virginia Department of Rail & Public Transportation (DRPT) called the Transit Ridership Incentive Program (TRIP) launched GRTC’s zero-fare ridership at the end of 2021. The purpose was to study and implement zero-fare service for a limited time, according to GRTC. Over a three year period, the funding would dwindle to zero.
The net cost for the zero- fare program for that time period was $20.4 million, according to Mass Transit, a trade publication. That’s after removing $1.2 million for fare collection costs. 
With the $8 million TRIP grant in place, other funding sources had to come forward to make the $20 million mark. So Virginia Commonwealth University stepped up to contribute $3.8 million, and GRTC ponied up $8.56 million in funds. The city of Richmond also contributed some funds. 
Knowing the DRPT grant was set to expire, GRTC launched a Transit Access Partnership program in 2023 to seek out other corporate sponsors and individuals to help sustain zero-fare ridership.
“Our focus for zero-fare and our TAP program has been at the forefront of what we’ve been doing over the last couple of months,” said Sheryl Adams, GRTC’s chief executive officer. “So, with the TAP program anyone can contribute. If you’re an organization, you can do a tax write-off through our 501C, which is Ride Finders.”
Torres said to help keep the program afloat, GRTC has also been seeking a variety of new sources.
“We have kind of gone after several paths to keep it sustained for the next year,” said Torres. “We’ve applied for a congestion mitigation air quality grant and that’s $2 million.”
New revenue from an expanded advertising program will also help with zero-fare funding, said Torres, who hopes to get up to two million dollars from it.
“We worked with the city and they did a franchise agreement, which now allows us to do advertising basically in any right of way, so not just at the pole stations, but at bus stops, shelters, poles, benches. We’ve also expanded the ability to advertise on our vehicles,” she said.
Adrienne Torres, the bus company’s chief of staff, said they’ve also been looking through their budget to see where else they can help with funds for the program.“We feel like we’re pretty close. Like I said, we have zero-fare in there for this year, but we still need to continue to have support for it,” she said. “Our grant applications are still pending. So hopefully we’ll know for sure in the next month or two where we are. Our budget’s going to go to the board in May. We have a strategy and a plan that hopefully will come to fruition for FY2026.”
Walker hopes her group’s new report on zero fare encourages everyone, from the members of the public to those with legislative power, to do all they can to help keep the service running. 
“I am calling on elected officials, employers, transit riders, environmentalists and everyday Richmonders to support the future of zero-fare transit through the GRTC Transit Access Partnership Program and their advertisement program,” said Walker. “It’s time to champion tap funding and ensure continued support for zero fare transit services.”

(Photo courtesy of Annie Watson of Sheepscot Valley Farm)Annie Watson, who along with her husband runs Sheepscot Valley Farm, expects the cost of organic grain imported from Canada to increase by as much as $100 per ton under new tariffs. That would mean an additional $1,200 to $1,400 a month to feed the 70 cows they milk the Whitefield dairy operation.
“Regardless of the size of our herds or whether we are first generation farmers or 10th generation dairy farmers, dairy farmers are facing the rising costs from tariffs,” she said. 
As president of the Maine Dairy Industry Association, Watson joined other leaders from Maine’s farming and craft beer industries who spoke Tuesday about their looming concerns for the next round of tariffs. While they worry increased costs could be passed onto consumers, the tariffs also come after many farms have already planned for the season ahead meaning higher prices could eat away at their already thin profit margins. 
The agriculture sector, like many Maine industries concerned by a potential trade war, is deeply interconnected with the state’s northern neighbor. Every year, Maine exports $1.4 billion in goods to Canada and in turn imports more than $5 billion worth of goods. 
President Donald Trump’s latest round of taxes on imports, set to take effect Wednesday, includes “reciprocal tariffs” on countries that have their own tariffs set on U.S. products. Since taking office in January, he has imposed new tariffs on China, as well as on certain goods from Canada and Mexico that could be expanded. He’s also added a tariff on imported cars and trucks set to take effect Thursday and raised the tax on foreign steel and aluminum.
The “on again, off again” tariff discussion that has colored the first few months of the Trump administration have left farmers in a state of limbo, waiting to see what will actually be imposed, how it will affect them and what decisions they will need to make in response, said Sarah Alexander, executive director of Maine Organic Farmers and Gardeners Association.
Alexander knows of one farm that planned to build another greenhouse this year, but has put that project on hold because the construction cost has already gone up by 50% due to the tariffs on steel and aluminum. 
In addition to the cost of feed grain and fertilizer that Watson predicts will be affected, farmers could see prices increase for fuel and other resources they need to keep their operations running, Alexander said. Maine’s craft breweries have significant concerns about the tariff on aluminum, given how much of their product is sold in cans, said Sarah Bryan, executive director of the Maine Brewers Guild. 
Alexander also said the tariffs could impact processing costs for the wild blueberry industry that is so integrated between Maine and Canada.
With these concerns echoed by farmers across the country, U.S. Secretary of Agriculture Brooke Rollins said Monday that the U.S. Department of Agriculture plans to aid farmers from potential economic fallout using similar strategies as in 2018, when a U.S.-China trade war during Trump’s first term led to an estimated $27 billion in U.S. agricultural export losses.
While Trump argues tariffs will encourage more domestic buying, Watson said degraded rail infrastructure makes it near impossible to transport all the grain that would be needed for farms in Maine from the Midwest or other parts of the country, especially with Canada so close. 
Dairy farmers like Watson don’t have control over the prices their products are sold at, so she said they could go deeper into debt or cut corners, like feeding cows less grain, which could lead to fertility and production issues for the animals. 
“I think our farmers are going to navigate how long can they hold off on passing through any of these increased prices to consumers, if possible,” Alexander said. But “ultimately that means it’s going to come out of the profitability of the farm.”

Last month, the Norfolk City Council requested the city’s school board to prepare an action plan to close and consolidate 10 schools before the start of the 2026-2027 school year. The move would help “reinvest savings into major school capital improvement and maintenance projects” the council said, including at Maury and Booker T. Washington High Schools, and three new elementary schools slated to replace aging buildings. 
Norfolk City Public Schools operates five high schools, six middle schools and 30 elementary schools.
Depending on the plan, the city’s move could be the most significant action taken to close and/or consolidate public schools in the commonwealth’s history. During the 2014-15 school year, Alexandria City Public Schools consolidated five middle and elementary schools within its two larger school buildings. However Norfolk’s plan shapes up, its ripple effects will be felt far and wide, some education leaders say.
“Closing any school in any school division is a significant leadership challenge for a superintendent as they work with their school board, their students and staff and their entire community,” said Scott Brabrand, a former public school superintendent and now executive director for the Virginia Association of School Superintendents.
In its March 25 resolution, the council directed the school board to “prioritize achieving these savings” when developing an action plan by Aug. 1 to close a minimum of two schools per year afterward.
The council warned the board that if a plan is not provided in a timely way, it would modify its funding allocations to the school division. The adjustment would then allow the council to prevent any further funding from being utilized at schools that are not operating at full capacity.
According to the Norfolk City Council’s resolution, the locality contributed $164.2 million to the school division for the current school year, which excludes costs for capital projects.
Enrollment at Norfolk City Public Schools had declined to approximately 26,000 students at the start of this school year, down from 32,000 students during the 2014-2015 school year, according to data from the Virginia Department of Education. The city projects that enrollment will continue to decrease, reaching around 24,000 students by the next school year.
“The council acknowledges the difficult choices the school board faces; nonetheless, eliminating unneeded buildings must be a priority addressed immediately,” the resolution states.
 ‘Never an easy decision’

Franklin ​​County Public Schools Superintendent Kevin Siers said consolidating schools is challenging, after recently completing a process to consolidate two schools in his division. 
“It’s never an easy decision and our school board took the role seriously,” Siers said in an interview.
County and school board leaders had a tough time weighing public input against the roles the schools played in each community, while the school division had 44 empty classrooms over 11 elementary schools, a $3.7 million loss in state funding and significant changes to the local composite index, a measurement of a locality’s ability to pay education costs.
Siers also added that the division would have faced cutting 70 positions.
“We had school board members who really struggled with it, especially those who lived in the communities where the schools were closing,” Siers said. “But in the end, we knew that we had to take some type of action, because the alternative was much more grim than closing two schools.”
Months after the decision, Siers was happy to report that because of the decision to consolidate two elementary schools, the division was able to place an art teacher, music teacher, physical education teacher and counselor at each of the 10 elementary schools, which Siers believes has “improved the culture at every elementary school by being able to have these additional personal personnel there full time, every day.”
 The plan

Norfolk City Public Schools plans to rebuild four schools and consolidate four additional ones. However, the division faces increased costs, including for Maury High School, whose cost estimate jumped from $150 million to $250 million.
Since 2013, a report by Cooperative Strategies has indicated that Norfolk City Public Schools has consistently operated three to 17 more schools than necessary for its population each year. The consulting firm, which analyzed the division’s capacity, estimated that the school division could have saved $81 million between 2013 and 2023.
“This isn’t about just closing schools, but it’s about right-sizing so that we can provide better resources, better buildings, and to be able to use those additional resources,” said Norfolk City Councilor Carlos J. Clanton at the March 25 meeting.
He added that he supported passing the resolution to ensure the school board knows it has the council’s backing, and to encourage the division to complete the report.
“Council is doing its part, and we need the school board to do theirs,” he said.
The school board will have a work session on April 2 and a regular meeting on April 23. Recently, the school division announced that it has created a planning committee tasked with reviewing the division’s facilities.

Some estimates have pegged the damages and economic losses from the fires at more than $250 billion. “We’ve had disaster after disaster after disaster,” said Assemblymember Dawn Addis, a Democrat.

(Christopher Shea/Rhode Island Current)For many California residents, the Los Angeles wildfires earlier this year were the latest and most searing example of the devastating effects of climate change. Some estimates have pegged the damages and economic losses from the fires at more than $250 billion.
“We’ve had disaster after disaster after disaster,” said Assemblymember Dawn Addis, a Democrat. “It’s the taxpayers and the insurance ratepayers that are bearing the cost. It’s not sustainable, it’s not right and it’s not ethical.”
Addis and Democratic lawmakers in nearly a dozen other states want to force the world’s largest fossil fuel companies to help pay for the recovery costs of climate-related disasters. Last year, Vermont became the first state to pass a “climate Superfund” law, followed soon after by New York.
This session, 10 states have seen similar proposals, several of which have advanced in key committees. Advocates point to legislation in Maryland that has drawn support in both chambers, as well as to strong grassroots support in California after the Los Angeles wildfires.
Lawmakers say the rapidly increasing cost of climate disasters — from wildfires to floods to sea level rise — is more than state budgets can bear.
“Climate Superfund is the ‘it girl’ policy of the [2025] session,” said Ava Gallo, climate and energy program manager with the National Caucus of Environmental Legislators, a forum for state lawmakers. “There’s a lot of popularity in the idea of holding polluters responsible.”
The momentum for these “polluter pays” bills is tied to the maturation of attribution science. That new field of research can help calculate fossil fuel companies’ contributions to historic emissions totals, as well as the role climate change played in causing or worsening natural disasters.
Vermont’s law was the first attempt to use that science to charge emitters for their role in causing devastating floods and other catastrophes.
Fossil fuel companies and their allies have fought back hard. Late last year, the American Petroleum Institute and the U.S. Chamber of Commerce filed a lawsuit challenging Vermont’s measure. The groups argue that emissions are governed by the federal Clean Air Act, precluding states from charging companies over global pollution.
Neither group responded to a Stateline interview request. The Independent Petroleum Association of America also declined an interview request.
A separate lawsuit, led by 22 Republican attorneys general, is challenging the New York law. And a conservative group has targeted Rachel Rothschild, an assistant professor of law at the University of Michigan Law School, who helped draft the legal justification for climate Superfund policy. The group, Government Accountability and Oversight, has sought to subject Rothschild to a deposition, The New York Times reported, a move that some experts view as an intimidation tactic.
Meanwhile, oil and gas executives asked President Donald Trump during a White House meeting this month to direct the Justice Department to join the legal fight against climate Superfund laws, The Wall Street Journal reported. Industry leaders are also pushing Congress to shield them from more than 30 lawsuits brought by state and local governments that aim to make them pay for some of the results of climate change.
While experts expect a bruising legal battle over climate Superfund policies, the threat of lawsuits hasn’t deterred more lawmakers from backing the concept.
“States were a little bit wary; they wondered, ‘Is this some new radical plan?’” said Cassidy DiPaola, communications director with the Make Polluters Pay campaign, a coalition of groups backing such bills. “Then one of the littlest states passed it and this powerhouse, New York, passed it. That really set the ball rolling.”
Lawmakers hope to use this emerging climate science to charge oil companies for disasters

Fossil fuel companies have cast doubt on attribution science. They also note that their production of oil and other products was done legally under U.S. and international regulations.
“Manufacturers will see this as a shakedown of any industry you don’t like at some point in the future, even though in the past they were licensed and operated under government regulation,” Brett Vassey, president and CEO of the Virginia Manufacturers Association, said during legislative testimony about a climate Superfund proposal in that state. “It will have a chilling effect on Virginia being able to grow its economy.”
Proponents of Superfund legislation point to legal settlements with large tobacco companies in the 1990s. Although those companies also sold their products legally, they were held responsible because they knew about the harmful effects of those products and deceived the public. Most climate Superfund proposals target companies for their emissions over the past 30 or so years, after leading experts had documented the dangers of greenhouse gases.
“There’s good documentation of how well the fossil fuel industry knew the probable long-term impacts of their product,” said Oregon state Sen. Jeff Golden, a Democrat. “Should an industry that made such historic profits over a period of time and made so many representations that we had no problem not bear any of the costs?”
Golden and other lawmakers say it’s becoming impossible for taxpayers to cover the costs of recovery from wildfires and other catastrophes. In Rhode Island, sea level rise is causing massive damage for coastal communities, said Democratic state Rep. Jennifer Boylan, who has sponsored a climate Superfund bill to help the state adapt.
Some advocates also note that Trump’s return to the White House has cut off the possibility of federal climate relief.
“All the states are affected by the disappearance of this federal funding,” said Gallo, of the state lawmakers group. “States everywhere are going to be looking at some way to fill the gap.”
This session, climate Superfund bills have been introduced in California, Connecticut, Hawaii, Maryland, Massachusetts, New Jersey, Oregon, Rhode Island, Tennessee and Virginia.
While the bills are structured differently, they all seek to target the largest polluters — often covering companies that produced 1 billion metric tons of emissions over the last 30 or so years. Lawmakers say that applies to roughly 100 companies.
The measures also take different approaches to assigning damages. Some direct state agencies to conduct complex studies to determine the costs of climate-caused disasters over a certain period, the approach pioneered by Vermont. Others set a fixed number that represents a conservative baseline for those damages. New York’s law set that figure at $75 billion over a 25-year period.
Many of the bills also require that significant amounts of the funding be directed to the communities hit hardest by pollution.
Advocates are particularly optimistic about the measures in California and Maryland.
Lawmakers in Maryland modified their bills to commission a study about the financial impacts of climate change. Those measures passed both the House and Senate, and legislators are working to reconcile the versions from each chamber. Figures produced by the study would be the backbone of a climate Superfund policy in a future session.
“From a legislative perspective, it’s a shot in the dark as to what the costs are,” said Democratic Del. David Fraser-Hidalgo, who sponsored one of the bills. “This will give us the factual data needed to make a more well-educated decision on policy.”
In New Jersey, an Assembly committee advanced a climate Superfund bill this month. State Sen. Bob Smith, a Democrat who chairs the Environment and Energy Committee and who sponsored the bill, said it will help to rebuild and fortify water treatment plants, schools and firehouses. He noted that Trump has called for the dismantling of the Federal Emergency Management Agency.
“The end of the world is coming; it’s kind of hard to ignore,” Smith said. “FEMA has been the backstop to help communities recover from disasters. If the handwriting isn’t on the wall to all the states that they’ve got to deal with this, shame on them.”
Lawmakers in many states have heard from mayors and other local government leaders that more climate recovery funding is essential.
“Municipal officials are getting behind [climate Superfund policies],” said Massachusetts state Sen. Jamie Eldridge, a Democrat who has sponsored similar legislation. “They’re facing the costs of flooding, of droughts, of heat waves, and really asking for relief.”

On April 2nd, the Supreme Court of the United States will hear oral arguments in Medina v. Planned Parenthood South Atlantic. The case addresses whether Medicaid beneficiaries can seek relief in federal court to enforce Medicaid’s “free-choice of provider provision,” which allows Medicaid beneficiaries to seek care from any provider that is qualified and willing to participate in the program.
While the case focuses on this specific question, it has its origins in broader efforts by anti-abortion policymakers to exclude Planned Parenthood clinics from the Medicaid program and, ultimately, eliminate all federal payments to Planned Parenthood centers. In this brief, we describe the case, the Medicaid policies underlying it, and potential implications for Medicaid beneficiaries’ access to reproductive health services.
 What is the case in front of the Supreme Court about?

The Supreme Court’s review of this case is limited to one question: Can a Medicaid beneficiary bring a civil action to enforce the Medicaid Act’s free choice of provider? This question is similar to one that the Court decided in 2023 (Health and Hospital Corp of Marion County v. Talevski ) when it ruled (7-2) that patients do have a private right of action to enforce certain conditions that federal Medicaid law imposes on states and health care providers.
However, the current case involves a different provision of federal law relating to free choice of provider under the Medicaid Act. Planned Parenthood and the individual beneficiary who has brought this case take the position that Medicaid beneficiaries meet the requirements to sue in order to enforce the free choice of provider provision. The Trump administrationhas weighed in on the side of South Carolina, contending that Medicaid beneficiaries should not be permitted to bring an action to enforce this provision.
In 2018, South Carolina’s Governor McMaster (R) issued an executive order prohibiting any clinic that provides abortion care from participating in the state’s Medicaid program. The order states that the state funds used to reimburse providers could be used to indirectly subsidize abortion care even though Medicaid only pays for non-abortion family planning services. The executive order had a direct impact on the Planned Parenthood clinics that offer abortion services in the state (South Carolina limits abortion to up to six weeks of pregnancy) but also offer enrollees other Medicaid-covered services including contraceptive care and STI screening and treatment. The state has historically reimbursed these providers for the non-abortion medical care they provide to Medicaid enrollees just like it pays for all other medical care. The federal Hyde Amendment bans the use of federal funds (including Medicaid) from being used to pay for abortions unless the pregnancy is a result of rape or incest or endangers the life of the pregnant person.
States operate Medicaid programs under federal guidance, and one of the federal provisions of the Medicaid law is known as free choice of provider. This provision states that “A State plan for medical assistance must… provide that any individual eligible for medical assistance… may obtain such assistance from any institution, agency, community pharmacy, or person, qualified to perform the service or services required… who undertakes to provide him such services.” Additionally, because many states require Medicaid beneficiaries to enroll in managed care, limiting their care to a defined network of providers, federal law states that beneficiaries may seek care from any Medicaid provider for family planning services specifically, even those outside the plan network.
The larger context for this case involves how a state determines who is a qualified provider, even though the Supreme Court is more narrowly focusing on private right of action. The statute does not define the word “qualified,” but longstanding federal regulations, recognize states’ authority to “set reasonable standards relating to the qualifications of providers.” The final lines of the regulation say that States need not provide payments to providers with certain felony convictions. The regulations and a separate provision contemplate that “[i]n addition to any other authority, a State may exclude” any provider from Medicaid for certain reasons “for which the Secretary could exclude” the provider from participating in Medicare.
In 2016, in a “Dear Medicaid Director letter” issued during the Obama administration, CMS wrote that states have the authority to set standards that providers must meet, but to disqualify a willing provider, the state must have a legitimate reason such as concerns about the fitness of the provider to meet the standards or evidence of fraud. It went on to say that states cannot target a specific provider and “The failure of a state to apply otherwise reasonable standards in an evenhanded manner may suggest such targeting.” CMS went on to say that “states may not deny qualification to family planning providers…solely because they separately provide…abortion or another service that the state does not approve of.” This letter was rescinded by the Trump administration in 2018. Whether it be through the Courts or through administrative actions, this issue will likely continue to be debated and legally challenged for the foreseeable future.
The Supreme Court, however, is only considering whether Medicaid beneficiaries have the right to bring a case to enforce their right to choose their provider. The Court is not considering whether South Carolina acted properly when it excluded Planned Parenthood from its Medicaid program, deeming them “unqualified” because they provide abortion services as well as other reproductive health care services. If the Supreme Court finds that Medicaid beneficiaries have the right to bring an action to enforce their right to choose any provider, the case will then go back down to the district court to determine whether South Carolina acted within its authority to exclude Planned Parenthood as a nonqualified provider. If the Supreme Court rules that Medicaid beneficiaries do not have a private right of action, then Planned Parenthood itself could appeal South Carolina’s decision that found them to be an unqualified provider.
 How have courts ruled about private right of action for Medicaid beneficiaries in other cases?

A civil rights statute, Section 1983, has long provided a mechanism for individuals to enforce the rights provided to them under federal programs, including Medicaid. There is a long history of litigation related to private enforcement of the Medicaid Act. While courts have affirmed the authority for individuals to use Section 1983 to protect Medicaid rights, the Supreme Court has issued decisions that have narrowed this authority. Currently there is a three-pronged test (pursuant to the cases Blessing v Freestone (1997), Gonzaga University v. Doe (2002), and Health & Hosp. Corp of Marion County v. Talevski(2023)) based on legal precedent that courts use to evaluate whether a federal law establishes an enforceable right:

whether the plaintiff is an intended beneficiary of the statute;
whether the plaintiff’s asserted interests are specific enough to be enforced; and
whether the statute imposes a binding obligation on the State.

In Talevski, the most recent Supreme Court case to consider this right, the high court reaffirmed the holdings in Gonzaga that a statutory provision is enforceable under Section 1983 when the provision is “phrased in terms of the persons benefits” and contains “right-creating individual centric language with an unmistakable focus on the benefited class.”
Federal circuit courts have generally upheld private enforcement of rights for Medicaid enrollees. Before the Supreme Court Talevski ruling in 2023, there was a split among circuit court rulings. In 2019 there were four circuit court opinions that all ruled in favor of beneficiaries’ right to enforce Medicaid provisions. However, in 2020, three of four circuit court decisions did not rule in favor of Medicaid enrollees, including one decision from the 5th Circuit Court of Appeals which ruled in favor of Texas’ decision to exclude Planned Parenthood. Until the Medina case, the Supreme Court had previously refused to review multiple cases in which Planned Parenthood patients were found to have an enforceable right. An earlier version of the Medina case, Planned Parenthood South Atlantic v. Baker, went up to the Supreme Court but was denied review. This is the first time the current configuration of the Supreme Court will hear a case involving Planned Parenthood.
While this case is narrowly focused on whether Medicaid beneficiaries have the right to sue to enforce their right to choose any willing, qualified provider, the Supreme Court’s decision will have implications for the many states wishing to exclude providers, such as Planned Parenthood, based on abortion politics and not based on clinical qualifications to provide medical services. If Medicaid beneficiaries cannot bring an action to enforce the free choice of provider provision, then states will have greater latitude to exclude providers, such as Planned Parenthood, based on political objections.
 What does this case mean for Medicaid beneficiaries?

This case has the potential to curtail low-income individuals’ access to preventive reproductive health care in South Carolina and potentially in many states in the nation. The Medicaid program covers one in five reproductive age women and is the largest source of coverage for women with low incomes, covering over four in ten (Figure 1). All state Medicaid programs must cover family planning services, which includes contraceptive care plus a range of related services such as physical exams, cancer screenings, pregnancy testing and counseling, and screenings for other conditions. Medicaid is an essential source of financing for safety-net clinics and is widely considered to be the largest single public payer of family planning services. KFF research has found that specialty reproductive health care clinics such as Planned Parenthood centers offer a broader range of services to their patients compared to non-specialized clinics.
Other states are likely to follow suit if the Court rules in South Carolina’s favor. In fact, several other states, such as Texas, Arkansas, Indiana, and Missouri have tried to keep Planned Parenthood clinics out of their Medicaid networks, and while some of these efforts were blocked by CMS and courts because they violate the free choice of provider requirements, there have been exceptions. Federal courts upheld Arkansas and Texas decisions excluding Planned Parenthood from their Medicaid programs. South Carolina filed a waiver application to CMS during the first Trump Administration to exclude Planned Parenthood clinics from their Medicaid program, and Tennessee also has a similar waiver pending. No action has been taken to date on these waivers.
Blocking Planned Parenthood from receiving Medicaid reimbursements or other public funds has been shown to reduce low-income women’s access to contraceptives. In 2013, Texas replaced its Medicaid family planning program with a 100% state funded program that excluded Planned Parenthood as a participating provider. Following the policy change, there was a sizable drop in Medicaid claims for long-acting contraceptives such as IUDs or implants, and injectable contraceptives and an increase in Medicaid-funded births.
 What is next?

The federal Solicitor General was granted approval to participate in oral arguments and has taken the position of South Carolina in this case. The Supreme Court will hear oral arguments on April 2nd and is expected to issue a ruling by the end of the term in June 2025.

The hypocritical double standards at work on the modern political right these days are often enough to make your head spin. Just think what Fox News shouters would be saying right now if a Kamala Harris administration had committed an outrageous breach of national security like the one Trump’s defense team did recently by divulging details of planned military operation.
And the same hypocrisy would undoubtedly apply closer to home as well.
Just imagine if Gov. Josh Stein — who controls the state budget office — did what Trump is doing by issuing directives to budget officials to simply cancel government funded programs authorized in a duly enacted budget.
Funding for school vouchers and crisis pregnancy centers? Gone. New programs at council of state departments led by Republicans? Canceled.
Republican lawmakers loyal to Trump would be apoplectic.
The bottom line: Gov. Stein would never take such action because he’s an honest and responsible leader who believes in the rule of law. Would that Trump and the political puppets he controls were of the same character.

Republicans looking to cut federal spending on Medicaid are eyeing work requirements as one possible option. (Justin Sullivan/Getty Images)Under an emerging Republican plan to require some Medicaid recipients to work, between 4.6 million and 5.2 million adults ages 19 to 55 could lose their health care coverage, according to a new analysis.
The study, conducted by Urban Institute researchers with support from the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation, calculated that up to 39% of the 13.3 million adults in that age group who became eligible for Medicaid when their states expanded the program under the Affordable Care Act would lose coverage if Congress required states to impose work rules.
The report suggests that most of those people would lose coverage not because they aren’t complying with the rules, but because they would struggle to report their compliance to the state.
“Most adults who would lose eligibility for federal Medicaid funding are working, engaged in work-related activities, or could qualify for exemptions not readily identifiable through state databases but could still face disenrollment because of the reporting requirements,” it states. The study identified several barriers to reporting, including lack of broadband access and lack of transportation.
Forty states plus the District of Columbia have expanded Medicaid under the ACA. Overall, nearly 72 million people, about a fifth of Americans, are enrolled in the program for low-income people, which is funded jointly by the federal government and the states.
Traditional Medicaid insurance was mainly available to children and their caregivers, people with disabilities and pregnant women. But the ACA, commonly known as Obamacare, allowed states to extend coverage to adults making up to 138% of the federal poverty level — about $21,000 a year for a single person.
Nationwide, more than 21 million people with low incomes have health insurance because of expanded Medicaid eligibility.
U.S. House Republicans in February pushed through a budget plan, now under consideration in the Senate, that would require about $880 billion in cuts to Medicaid over the next decade to help cover the cost of $4.5 trillion in tax cuts. The budget doesn’t contain specifics on how that target would be met. But work requirements are a likely money-saving option: A 2023 analysis from the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office found that imposing work rules on Medicaid recipients ages 19 to 55 who are not parents or caregivers would cut federal spending by an estimated $109 billion over the next 10 years.
The Congressional Budget Office based that projection on a plan the GOP-controlled U.S. House approved in 2023. That bill, the likely blueprint for the work requirements Republicans are considering now, would have required adults ages 19-55 to work, participate in a job training program or perform community service for at least 80 hours per month for three or more months in a calendar year. Parents and caretakers of dependent children, and those unable to work because of a health condition, would have been exempt.
Many Republican-led states are eager to impose work requirements on able-bodied Medicaid recipients. Thirteen states received permission to impose work rules on at least some Medicaid enrollees during the first Trump administration. Nine additional states requested permission to enact Medicaid work requirements during Trump’s earlier term but had not won approval by the time it ended.
When the Biden administration came into office, it rescinded all the approvals.
Supporters say requiring Medicaid recipients to work, study or train for a career gives them a boost toward self-sufficiency and financial stability. Critics, however, say such rules end up hurting far more people than they help.
The researchers from the Urban Institute mostly based their analysis on the experience of Arkansas, which in June 2018 became the first state to require some Medicaid recipients to work, volunteer, go to school or participate in job training to receive benefits. By the time a federal judge halted the policy in April 2019, 18,000 adults had lost coverage.
The researchers also looked at New Hampshire, which began implementing a work requirement but halted the program in July 2019 before suspending anyone’s coverage.
“What was found in a lot of qualitative research on the previous work requirement programs is that a lot of people were unaware of the policy, or they didn’t understand the policy,” said Michael Karpman, an Urban Institute researcher who co-authored the study.
“People who need coverage the most would do the most to try to maintain it. On the other hand, those people could also face the most difficulty with the administrative barriers,” Karpman said.
In a 2020 study examining how Arkansas’ last experience with work requirements played out, researchers from the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health “found no evidence that the policy succeeded in its stated goal of promoting work and instead found substantial evidence of harm to health care coverage and access.”
Arkansas Republican Gov. Sarah Huckabee Sanders announced in January that she would ask the federal government for permission to institute work requirements, regardless of what Congress decides. The state submitted the request last week.












Especially for a rural state like Arkansas, work requirements fail to take into account a lot of the realities that people may face.


– Christin Harper, policy director for Arkansas Advocates for Children and Families




Arkansas Republican state Rep. Aaron Pilkington, who serves on the health committee in his chamber, said lawmakers “learned our lesson from the last go-round.”
Pilkington said that under the new proposal, the state will only pause coverage instead of canceling it, giving recipients an opportunity to prove they are complying. And, he said, the online portal for reporting will be a lot more user-friendly.
“I think it’s a reasonable thing to ask for able-bodied people to look for work, or try to obtain work,” Pilkington said.
But Christin Harper, policy director for Arkansas Advocates for Children and Families, said even the new version would be a challenge for many enrollees. Many people on Medicaid are juggling multiple jobs, and having to report to the state every month would be a significant burden.
“Especially for a rural state like Arkansas, work requirements fail to take into account a lot of the realities that people may face,” Harper said. She added that “with the overall job market, job opportunities may or may not be available in some of these rural towns.”

(Photo by Dana Wormald/New Hampshire Bulletin)In New Hampshire, timber is considered taxable real estate. But since that tax is assessed at the time of harvesting, some worry carbon programs that keep trees standing for decades to offset emissions could cut into local revenue.
A group of lawmakers have proposed a fix, House Bill 123, which they say would simply allow revenue from such programs to be taxed the same as felled trees. The bill comes after action last session to establish a registry of properties in the state enrolled in carbon programs, and amid ongoing debate over the management of the Connecticut Lakes Headwaters forest in the northern part of the state. 
“Our world has and continues to change,” said Rep. Mike Ouellet, a Colebrook Republican and one of the bill’s sponsors, at a hearing for the bill. “HB 123 is nothing more than a reflection of today’s varying timber market.”
The bill faced some pushback from conservation and business groups when it was introduced. It came out of the House Municipal and County Government Committee with a unanimous, 18-0, recommendation that the full chamber pass it with an amendment. But last month, Republican Majority Leader Jason Osborne moved to table it. The Auburn Republican called the issue “important,” but suggested it would be better to wait until the Department of Revenue Administration finished a related report later this year.
His motion failed, 171-185, and the House passed the amended bill, 197-158. Now, it awaits further action in the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee. 
Rep. Arnold Davis, a Milan Republican, said when introducing the bill that it had two goals: to keep municipalities “whole,” since the tax is retained locally, and to put timber harvesting on “a fair playing field” with carbon credit projects. 
Davis and other supporters of the bill said it was not a new tax, but simply a new branding of the same tax. Some opponents, though, disagreed, and said it created a tax on carbon credit programs where none currently exists. 
“This is not a new tax. It is still timber tax,” Davis said. “It is simply a way to keep a fairly new way of doing business from circumventing around paying their property tax to the towns, and to push for best forestry management practices.”
Technically, under current state law, standing timber can be taxed when assessors determine a municipality is “unreasonably deprived of revenue because of the failure of an owner” to cut down timber that has “arrived at the degree of maturity most suitable for its use.”
But Davis said this section of the law has never been invoked, and felt the bill provided a simpler avenue to collect the revenue. Before the timber tax was enacted decades ago, officials would visit properties to assess the value of the standing trees — a “cumbersome” and likely inaccurate process, and one property owners could circumvent by chopping down their trees, Davis said. 
Now, and for the better part of the past century, property owners are charged a 10% yield tax upon cutting down timber after a certain amount and under certain circumstances. This made the process simpler for assessors and more accurate, Davis said. 
While that system worked for decades, Davis said, carbon programs have changed the landscape. He pitched the bill as a way to adapt and close what he called a “loophole.”
The bill would require landowners to pay an annual yield tax of 10% of the “estimated net value of the carbon offset credits issued and sold in the previous calendar year.” Similarly, the state’s timber tax is 10% of the “stumpage value” — the value of the timber at the time it is cut, as determined by assessing officials. In 2023, it brought in over $3.4 million across the state, according to the Department of Revenue Administration. 
Right now, at least nine property owners in the state are enrolled in carbon programs, according to the latest version of the state registry. Collectively, they amount to more than 186,000 acres, with the smallest property enrolled standing at 122 acres in Hillsborough County, and the largest being more than 141,000 acres of the Connecticut Lakes forest in Coös County. One project has a minimum duration of 20 years, four are listed at 40 years, and the other four — including the Connecticut Lakes forest — at 100 years. 
Aurora Sustainable Lands, the owner of the Connecticut Lakes forest, has voiced opposition to this session’s legislation. 
Meredith Hatfield, associate director for policy and government relations with The Nature Conservancy, raised concerns when the legislation was introduced that it “would undermine efforts to encourage sustainable forestry and could penalize landowners who seek to keep forests as forests to provide a broader range of benefits to the state, its residents, and visitors.” Like Osborne, she suggested lawmakers wait for the Department of Revenue Administration’s final report on the topic before taking action. 
Meanwhile, Executive Councilor Joseph Kenney, a Wakefield Republican, said the bill was about “fairness.” Kenney, whose district includes the northern chunk of the state where debate on carbon programs has been especially prominent, said the bill would make it so that large property owners can’t “escape” being taxed. 
“We just want fairness, through this bill, throughout the state,” Kenney said.",https://newhampshirebulletin.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/woodstimbertax-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-04-02 06:00:31.318280

(David Montgomery/Stateline)WATER VALLEY, Texas — On a recent day when the wind gusted close to 40 miles per hour, 82-year-old George Neill was making repairs on his ranch, oblivious to the nearby cluster of wind turbines churning the sky behind him.
“After about a year, you never know the things are here,” said Neill, who leases part of his West Texas property to an East Coast-based renewable energy company that placed three wind turbines on it four years ago.
Hundreds of other wind turbines stretch across this landscape, instantly visible to motorists traveling to nearby San Angelo and other towns. The turbines aren’t the only renewable energy producers amid the mesas: From a distance, a glistening array of solar panels resembles a small lake.
Texas is famous for producing oil and gas, but renewable energy has become deeply embedded in the state’s culture and economy. Texas led the nation in generating electricity from wind power and utility-scale solar power in 2023, and wind and solar energy projects contribute tax revenue to local governments and struggling school districts. Texas landowners are expected to receive nearly $30 billion in lease payments under current and expected projects, according to an industry study.
But in recent years, Texas has loosened its political embrace of alternative energy. For the second legislative session in a row, many Texas lawmakers are trying to derail or curb future renewable energy projects.











They are relatively new players to the market, so there’s going to be pushback from incumbents.


– Joshua Rhodes, research scientist at the University of Texas at Austin



The shift is rooted in a number of a factors, including the second Trump administration’s antipathy toward renewables and an aggressive recommitment to fossil fuels in Texas energy policy. There is lingering concern over the reliability of the state’s electrical grid, after all types of power sources failed during a devastating 2021 winter storm. Some people object to the aesthetics of wind and solar farms, or note that turbines and panels can harm some wildlife.
Texas is not alone. Once focused on stopping individual projects at the local level, renewable energy opponents have been making inroads in other state legislatures, too. They have received backing from the oil and gas industry. And they’ve been galvanized by the 2022 passage of the Inflation Reduction Act, the largest-ever attempt to speed the transition to clean energy.
In neighboring Oklahoma, for example, hundreds of people rallied at the state Capitol in January to urge Republican Gov. Kevin Stitt to issue an executive order halting new wind and solar projects. Like Texas, Oklahoma is a major oil and natural gas producer, but it generated 45% of its total in-state electricity from renewable resources in 2023.
Climate disasters are on the rise. These states want to make oil companies pay.

Stitt, a strong supporter of renewable energy, is highly unlikely to issue such an order. But he will leave office in two years, and several Republicans discussed as possible successors appeared at the rally. One of them, Attorney General Gentner Drummond, last month on social media criticized what he called “the green energy scam” and urged Stitt and state lawmakers to tighten wind farm rules during the current session.
In Arizona, the House earlier this year approved a bill that would bar wind farm projects within a dozen miles of any property zoned for residential use — a restriction that would apply to about 90% of the land in the state, according to an analysis by the Arizona Republic.
In Ohio, a 2021 law allowing county commissioners to create restricted areas where utility-scale solar and wind projects can’t be built has had a huge impact, as 26 Ohio counties have banned renewable energy projects. This year, GOP lawmakers have introduced legislation that would end all state solar subsidies.
And in Missouri, Republican legislators are pushing a bill that would raise taxes on farmers who lease their land for wind or solar energy projects.
The expanding opposition to renewables isn’t unexpected, said Joshua Rhodes, a research scientist at the University of Texas at Austin who studies the power grid. He noted that wind, solar and battery storage have rapidly become the “cheapest way to put more energy on the grid.”
“They’re victims of their own success,” he told Stateline. “They are relatively new players to the market, so there’s going to be pushback from incumbents.”
Opposing sides
At the center of the current debate in Texas is state Sen. Lois Kolkhorst, a Republican committee chair who has resurrected a 2023 bill that would require new utility-scale solar and wind projects to get permits from the state’s Public Utility Commission, regulations that aren’t imposed on projects for natural gas and other energy sources. The bill also calls for set-back requirements and cleanup funds.











The land isn’t just a piece of property to us. It’s our home, our sanctuary and a big part of who we are.


– Laurie Dihle, who lives on 154 acres in Franklin County, Texas



Kolkhorst, in a statement to Stateline, called the legislation “a common-sense approach to the encroachment of wind and solar facilities being scattered across our great state with no consideration or safeguards for landowners or the environment.”
At an hourslong Senate committee hearing recently where opponents of Kolkhorst’s bill outnumbered supporters, farmers, ranchers and small-town Texans sometimes found themselves on opposite sides, either arguing that sprawling wind farms and solar arrays are a lasting source of economic vitality or a threat to a beloved way of life.
“The land isn’t just a piece of property to us,” said Laurie Dihle, who lives on 154 acres in Franklin County with her husband. “It’s our home, our sanctuary and a big part of who we are. When we look out across the road, we see rolling green pastures and trees. Now we’re facing the possibility of that view and so much more being replaced by a sprawling solar farm.”
Environmentalists and industry representatives view Kolkhorst’s bill as a roadblock in the march toward green energy. Luke Metzger, executive director of Environment Texas, said the bill would open the door to “a really arbitrary discriminatory permitting regime,” requiring wind and solar developers to get permits that other energy producers do not have to have.
Describing herself as a “lifelong wildlife conservationist,” Kolkhorst said she introduced the bipartisan bill with nine other senators in an effort that “looks past the billions in wind and solar subsidies to instead focus on the total impact of these projects on our land, people and wildlife.”
But oil and gas projects also can harm wildlife, and scientists note that the emissions released by fossil fuels worsen climate change disasters.
Blue states hope their clean energy plans withstand collision with Trump

Insiders following the legislation, including Metzger, identify one of the bill’s major supporters as Kolkhorst donor Dan Friedkin, a billionaire Houston businessman.
Friedkin, chairman emeritus of the Texas Parks and Wildlife Commission, is owner and CEO of The Friedkin Group, a consortium of businesses and investments that includes Gulf States Toyota. Gulf States is one of the world’s largest distributors of Toyota vehicles and parts, with exclusive rights to sell Toyotas in Texas and four other states. Gulf States Toyota Inc. State PAC made four donations totaling $42,500 to Kolkhorst from October of 2020 to October of 2024, according to the Texas Ethics Commission.
Friedkin is a stunt pilot and outdoorsman with a ranch in South Texas. Neither he nor his lobbyist, Laird Doran, senior vice president for public and legal affairs at The Friedkin Group, returned phone calls from Stateline.
Texas lawmakers have filed dozens of wind- and solar-related bills this session, including measures aimed at restricting the placement of battery storage facilities, curbing tax breaks and subsidies for renewable companies and limiting the amount of electricity solar and wind projects contribute to the state’s power grid.
Republican state Sen. Phil King, for example, is pushing a bill that would mandate that 50% of all new electricity must come from natural gas, nuclear or battery storage. King said solar and wind power should be part of the state’s energy mix, but he claims they aren’t reliable enough to serve as the foundation.
State Rep. Don McLaughlin, a Republican, has introduced legislation mandating a study of the economic impact of wind and solar projects on local communities, as well as noise and health effects, threats to wildlife and the challenges of disassembling worn-out systems. Sweetwater, Texas, has thousands of composite blades piled up in “a windmill graveyard.”
Rural support
But many rural GOP lawmakers whose districts long ago sprouted oil rigs and pump jacks are now strong supporters of wind and solar power.
“It’s nonstop windmills on both side of the road for 70 miles,” said state Rep. John Smithee of Amarillo, describing a typical drive from his hometown in the Texas Panhandle to the Capitol in Austin. “Almost all of those [constituents] have benefited.”
Solar energy and its cheaper bills are coming to more disadvantaged communities

State Rep. Drew Darby, whose northwest Texas district includes San Angelo and Water Valley, an unincorporated community of around 300, said revenue from wind power has resulted in countywide improvements and lease payments to property owners.
“It’s been a positive impact on rural effectiveness,” said Darby. “Landowners … are receiving nice payments for leasing the property.”
In Water Valley, taxes from the increased revenue paved the way for a tax-free bond election that enabled the town’s K-12 school to add an upscale weight room, a technical educational facility and a “cafetorium” that serves as a dining room and performance hall. The school building had previously been so small that students had to eat in shifts.
The wind farm is expected to generate $123 million in local taxes over the 30-year life of the project, as well as more than $100 million in payments to landowners.
George Neill, the West Texas rancher, said he takes the wind turbines in stride as he roams across his 1,700-acre spread.
He’s not at liberty to reveal the amount of his payments. He’s not getting rich, he said, but the money “makes a difference when you’re trying run a ranch.”

I think it allows the plaintiffs to keep going. So, yeah, I think that it does definitely strike a good balance.”
But the bill, which had a hearing in the House Judiciary Committee last week, faces a tight deadline for passage.
The General Assembly ends its work at midnight, April 7. The bill must get out of the House Judiciary and through a preliminary and final vote by the full House of Delegates, before beginning again in the Senate.
Sources said passing the bill this year gets tougher if it’s not in the Senate by Thursday.
The subject matter of the bill is emotionally charged. That and concerns about potential litigation could attract lengthy committee and floor debates.
Budget-hawk Republicans on the committee worried the amended bill focuses on limiting the costs to the state rather than focusing on the victims.
“It seems what we’re doing right now is we’re saying, ‘How can we protect the state and the budget?'” Del. Robin L. Grammer Jr. (R-Baltimore County), said during a Judiciary Committee meeting Tuesday.

“I’m not sure how a different level of justice for public versus private makes these people whole,” Grammer said. “And in this moment, it very much seems like we’re not thinking of these folks. We’re actually saying, ‘What are we going to do about the budget?’ So, I just don’t feel comfortable with this at all.”
The Child Victims Act, passed in 2023, made it easier for adults who were sexually abused as children to sue the institutions that protected their alleged abusers. The bill eliminated time restrictions on filing lawsuits both against private institutions but also state and local governments.
That law also capped claims against private institutions at $1.5 million per occurrence. Claims against public institutions – state and local government agencies – are capped at $890,000 per occurrence.
One group of lawyers claiming to represent 5,000 plaintiffs has been in negotiations with the state since 2023 with claims under that law. The total potential liability for those claims has not been made public but could easily be in the billions.
Wilson said he filed this year’s bill in an attempt to reconcile the need for survivors to bring their cases to court, while addressing the unintended, potentially bankrupting consequences facing the Maryland government.
His bill would have lowered the cap on claims against the state from $890,000 to $400,000. Additionally, it proposed limiting payouts to an individual claimant regardless of the number of alleged instances of abuse.

The amended bill changes the maximum payout for cases against public and private institutions beginning June 1. Claims filed before the effective date would be subject to the current law.
Claims against private institutions, such as private schools or religious institutions, would be capped at $700,000. Claims against government agencies would be capped at $400,000.
The amendments also eliminate the “per occurrence” multiplier that exposes the state to billions in potential liabilities. Similar claims forced the Archdiocese of Baltimore to preemptively seek bankruptcy protection before the 2023 law took effect.
Should the amended bill pass, “all of the different occurrences would be happening under one umbrella,” said House Judiciary Committee Chair Luke Clippinger (D-Baltimore City).
Maximum payouts under that “umbrella” would be limited to $700,000 or $400,000 total.
Del. Lauren Arikan (R-Harford), speaking during a committee meeting, said the lower cap was too low.

“Six thousand dollars a year is offensively low given these children could not escape their abusers,” Arikan said, basing her estimates on a boy abused as a teen who lives to the average life expectancy for a male.
Attorney’s fees in such cases would also be limited — 20% for out of court settlements and 25% if the case goes to court.
The amended bill asks the state judiciary to adopt rules to handle the influx of cases.
“In other words, basically signaling to them: Hey, you’re going to have a number of cases. You should probably look to get together and draft rules,” Clippinger said.
The bill asks the court system to provide the legislature with an annual report on resolved cases, including the amounts paid out and a summary of the underlying claims in each case.
One of the most problematic portions of the bill as introduced was language that placed limits on damages retrospectively.
Initially, lawmakers said they received assurances from Attorney General Anthony Brown that the change would be legal. But the decision to strike the retroactive language in spite of those assurances indicates they were less certain about those claims.
“I’ve heard a lot from a lot of different people over the last week,” Clippinger said. “I think that is fairly close to being a place where I don’t know that everybody’s totally happy or totally unhappy, which is, as has been stated, our goal from time to time.”",https://marylandmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/DSC_0064-1024x683.jpeg,,,2025-04-02 06:00:31.318280

Robbyn Lewis (D-Baltimore City) discusses amendments for House Bill 503. (Photo by Danielle J. Brown/Maryland Matters)The House voted 104-15 Tuesday for what started as Gov. Wes Moore’s (D) priority housing legislation but which was so heavily amended that the not even the original name remains.
What began as the governor’s “Housing for Jobs Act” will now head to the Senate as the “Housing Development Act” – with nearly every component of the bill that tied housing development to job growth stricken.
The heavily amended House Bill 503 now prompts the Department of Housing and Community Development to set 10-year housing targets for the state, its counties and every municipality, and report on their progress annually.
“It allows our entire state to work together to make sure that each jurisdiction has a role … in showing how to produce the housing that our people need,” said Del. Robbyn Lewis (D-Baltimore City) during debate on the House  floor. “Our state is 96,000 housing units short. We’re not serving the needs of our constituents. This bill allows us to do that.”
Most of the changes adopted by the House were first introduced in the House Environment and Transport Committee last week.
When introduced in January, the governor’s bill was framed as an expansion on his housing package from last year. The original version aimed to expedite housing development by requiring counties to automatically approve most qualifying project requests in areas where the state determined there was an imbalance between housing and jobs.
House members overhaul Moore housing bill with ‘simpler’ amendments

The bill did not get its first hearing until March, but representatives from the counties and others quickly expressed “significant” concerns, particularly over the bill’s language that would have forced counties to approve housing in some situations.
Under the amended bill approved Tuesday, each jurisdiction would have a hand in creating those targets and would consider estimates for future employment and housing demand along with population growth and other considerations.
The bill also creates so-called “vesting rights” so that a housing developer with an approved project proposal would retain the right to develop the property for at least five years, or a period granted by the local jurisdiction or the Maryland-National Capital Park and Planning Commission, whichever is longer.
The legislation creates a new Housing Opportunities Made Equitable Commission — the HOME Commission — a group of various stakeholders that would study the housing crisis in the state and make recommendations to lawmakers to address the issue.
During a floor session Tuesday morning, Del. Christopher T. Adams (R-Lower Shore) secured one amendment to add a residential real estate owner to the commission, which was seen as a friendly amendment and accepted into the bill.
Other Republican amendments were not as lucky.
Del. Kathy Szeliga (R-Baltimore County), noting that “quite a bit of the bill was stricken in the reprint,” offered an amendment to opt Baltimore County out of the provisions of the legislation. She said the county is more proactive in setting future housing plans than what the bill would require.
“We are, in Baltimore County, setting these targets and these goals on a local level through our county council that does a great job of doing this every four years,” Szeliga said. “I don’t think that the state setting housing goals should be preemptive over the local county. My county councilman does an amazing job, as do all seven of them. I prefer to leave this in the hands of our local government and not have the state override that.”
With clock ticking, lawmakers still hope to iron out issues on Moore’s housing bill

Lewis argued that the bill does not attempt to override any local planning efforts but calls on the counties to work with state housing officials to set local targets that would help boost housing supply in their unique areas.
“These targets are non-binding, and the process for having each jurisdiction work with the department actually sets up a really strong and regulatory consistency standard,” Lewis said. “So that, across our state, we’re all working together to make sure that each jurisdiction builds and produces the amount of housing it uniquely needs on a timeline, supported and encouraged by the Department and the HOME commission.
“This is not a preemption bill,” she said. “We, the committee, understood very well the concerns about that.”
Szeliga’s amendment failed on party lines, as did another proposed by Del. Matthew Morgan (R-St. Mary’s) that would have restricted local jurisdictions from approving new housing projects in areas where schools are overcrowded.
Despite the hefty changes, the Moore administration has previously expressed support for the new direction of the legislation, saying it still “moves the needle” toward the governor’s goal of boosting housing supply in the state.
Senators will need to take a look at what is essentially a brand new bill than the Senate version they last considered in early March. With just days left in session, senators will need to work quickly to pass the legislation out of committee and before the full chamber before Sine Die on Monday.",https://marylandmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/DSC02423-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-04-02 04:58:59.359349

Ohio Education Association President Scott DiMauro testified against Ohio Senate Bill 127 Tuesday morning during the Ohio Senate Education Committee meeting. The bill would revise Ohio’s public school closure law and require a poor performing school to either close or take remedial action.

“S.B. 127 proposes a heavy handed and overreaching state approach to local schools that receive low ratings on state report cards,” DiMauro said. “The impact of the actions compelled by S.B. 127 would harm students and communities. The harsh measures required by the bill ignore mitigating factors, forcing districts to make counterproductive decisions that could harm well-functioning schools.”
Senate Education Committee Chair Andrew Brenner, R-Delaware, introduced the bill last month and no one has submitted supporter testimony for the bill yet. Five people submitted opponent testimony while the Buckeye Institute and the pro-charter-school Thomas B. Fordham Institute submitted interested party testimony.

S.B. 127 defines a poor performing school as a school (district-operated, community or STEM), serving grades four and older, that has performed in the bottom 5% among public schools based on its Performance Index Score for three consecutive years, and is in the bottom 10% based on its Value-Added Progress for three consecutive years. 
A poor-performing school would have the option to close at the end of the school year or replace its principal and a majority of licensed staff. Another option is the school could get the help of an Ohio Department of Education and Workforce management organization, charter management organization, education service center, or an Ohio public or private university with experience in school improvement. 
Ohio charter schools are automatically closed if they have three straight years of poor performance. 
“Instead of offering significant support, S.B. 127 proposes significant punishments that will most likely destabilize schools where many great things are happening, even if those successes are not revealed on data printouts of standardized test scores,” DiMauro said. “The barriers to learning caused by under-resourced schools and communities do not disappear when a state punishes a school district.
Greg R. Lawson, a research fellow at the Buckeye Institute, said the bill addresses chronic underperformance in public schools. 
“Critics worry that closures may disrupt communities, but trapping students in the status quo cycle of underachieving schools is far more disruptive to students and their futures,” he said. 
Thomas B. Fordham Institute’s Vice President for Ohio Policy Chad Aldis said he would support the bill if a few tweaks were made including revising the growth measure to the Ohio report card one-star rating on Value Added Progress.
“This is a clearer and more stable indicator of inadequate growth, and it better reflects the state’s own definition of “low performance,” Aldis said. “Combining this with a bottom 5% Performance Index score would ensure that only schools with sustained low achievement and weak student progress are flagged— exactly as intended.”

But on Monday night they said they&#8217;re continuing their work to root out anticompetitive practices by health care companies. Then on Tuesday came news that some of their work against insulin manufacturers could be unraveling as a result of Trump&#8217;s actions. [&#8230;],"One of the entrances to the Federal Trade Commission Building in Washington, DC, that serves as the headquarters of the Federal Trade Commission (FTC).President Donald Trump is trying to fire two members of the Federal Trade Commission. But on Monday night they said they’re continuing their work to root out anticompetitive practices by health care companies.
Then on Tuesday came news that some of their work against insulin manufacturers could be unraveling as a result of Trump’s actions.
Commissioners Rebecca Kelly Slaughter and Alvaro Bedoya appeared in a virtual health care roundtable aimed at highlighting ways in which corporate concentration in that sector is driving up prices and hurting patients. 
The event was sponsored by the group Fight Corporate Monopolies. And it appeared that part of the purpose was to show that Slaughter and Bedoya were still on the job as they fight Trump in court. Critics say the president’s attempt in March to fire the Democratic commissioners was a corrupt favor to tech billionaires who bankrolled Trump’s campaign and his inauguration.
Antitrust advocates: Trump’s FTC firings are a favor to his billionaire buddies 

Monday’s roundtable had to do with concerns Trump himself has expressed — that huge health care conglomerates are using middlemen and other practices to drive up the cost of drugs and other care.
Alvaro Bedoya, who was appointed to the FTC by former President Joe Biden, said increasing corporate control of the health sector is partly responsible for the fact that Americans pay by far the most for care, yet have among the worst health outcomes among developed nations.
“The state of American health care is shameful and embarrassing — the impact it has on regular people,” he said. “It’s shameful and embarrassing what happens when people get a cancer diagnosis. They’re forced to fundraise from friends and family as many of them go bankrupt. It’s shameful and embarrassing that life expectancy in this country is years (less) than what it could be. It’s even more embarrassing that people living paycheck-to-paycheck have even more years taken away from them.”
He added, “It’s hard to look at the system and not see that at least some substantial part of those problems are caused by concentration and consolidation in the health care industry.”
Among the things Bedoya and Slaughter did to get a grasp of the situation was in 2022 to order a study of the conduct of pharmacy middlemen known as pharmacy benefit managers. The biggest three are part of the conglomerates UnitedHealth Group, CVS Health, and Cigna-Express Scripts. They handle nearly 80% of the insured drug transactions in the United States. 
Last July, the FTC released an interim report saying that the companies appeared to be improperly pushing up prices and hurting patients. Then in October, the FTC sued them on allegations that they were gouging patients who needed insulin to stay alive.
But by early Tuesday evening came word that the FTC’s general counsel was staying that suit, possibly because there aren’t enough commioners with undisputed standing to hear it.
“Today, the General Counsel of the FTC stayed the administrative adjudication of the Commission’s case against the three largest pharmacy benefit managers (PBMs) over the price of insulin,” Slaughter and Bedoya said in a joint statement. “He, not any sitting commissioner, took this action; there are no Commissioners available at the FTC to adjudicate this case as a result of the Trump Administration’s attempt to remove us. Sadly, this was an entirely foreseeable consequence of illegally attempting to fire the minority Commissioners.”
They added, “The American people deserve a fair and timely adjudication of the serious allegations in the FTC’s complaint. We strongly object to the pause in this matter. Here, justice delayed will be justice denied. It is hard to think of a matter that is more important.” 
During Monday’s roundtable, Utah pharmacist Sheldon Birch described other problems in the pharmaceutical space. He said pharmacies such as his have no choice about signing the contracts the big pharmacy middlemen put before them. Birch said the reimbursements he gets under those contracts make it hard to stay in business.
“We see a massive transfer of wealth from Main Street to Wall Street,” he said. “It’s a problem. I’m a capitalist. I own businesses. But we need to have some help so we can have a playing field that is fair… Help me keep my small business alive. Help keep the dollars and cents on America’s small-town main streets.”
Slaughter, who took a Democratic seat on the FTC during Trump’s first term, said the antitrust laws the agency is supposed to enforce are intended to stop unfair flows of cash from Main Street to Wall Street.
“The law does not contemplate that,” she said. “This isn’t what the law was designed to protect.”

Carmen Comsti of National Nurses United said harm caused by corporate concentration extends beyond pharmacy. She said the 2019 purchase of non-profit hospital Mission Health in Asheville, N.C., by for-profit HCA Healthcare harmed the residents of a rural region. 
HCA closed a cancer center, a wheelchair clinic, primary-care clinics, and it reduced charity care, geriatric services, security and hospital chaplains at the western North Carolina facility, Comsti said.
“It’s not just what health care systems are doing to get market control,” she said. “It’s what they’re doing to our communities with that power.”
Deb Keaveny, a Minnesota pharmacist, said it’s important for Trump to keep politics out of antitrust enforcement.
“We are deeply concerned about the administration’s recent decisions,” she said, “Americans need reassurance that the FTC can and will stop anticompetitive practices in the corporate monopolization of health care. This isn’t a partisan issue and the removals (of Bedoya and Slaughter) put ongoing studies, investigations and actions in jeopardy and weaken enforcement.”
Bedoya seemed eager to get back to a sole focus on his day job.
“My hope is that we can get back to normal and start pushing this work forward,” he said.

Mark N. Fisher (R-Calvert) speaking on the House floor on his failed reparations amendment Tuesday. (Photo by Danielle J. Brown/Maryland Matters.)The House granted preliminary approval Tuesday to a bill that would create a Maryland Reparations Commission, putting Maryland a step closer to becoming one of the few states to study inequality faced by African descendants in the state.
But the House first had to beat back two amendments to Senate Bill 587, including one on school choice that sparked heated back-and-forth after its sponsor said Black children’s problems today are the result of the “modern Democrat plantation of public education.”
Del. Mark Fisher (R-Calvert) offered the amendment that sought to provide school choice for students  enrolled in one-star schools, the lowest rating on the state Department of Education‘s five-star rating system in its annual report card for schools.
Under his proposal, the parent or guardian of a child in such a school could choose a public or nonpublic school to send the child, with state and local per pupil funding used to let the student attend the chosen school.
Fisher, who emphasized he grew up in Baltimore City, said that while some members of the city’s delegation were “laughing” at his proposal, the amendment made sense because the majority of children “stuck” in one-star schools are Black.
“That’s on you. That’s not from slavery. Instead, that’s from the modern Democrat plantation of public education where kids aren’t learning in one-star schools,” Fisher said on the floor. “You, the Democrat Party, have kept kids on the plantation of not learning. Laugh as you may. You own it because you’re in charge.”
Del. Joseline Peña-Melnyk (D-Prince George’s and Anne Arundel) gave a short history lesson in reponse, as well as a summary of the bill. She read a part of the bill that allows the commission to assess “any other topic deemed appropriate.”
  Health and Government Operations Chair Joseline Peña-Melnyk (D-Anne Arundel & Prince George’s) speaking on the House Floor. (Photo by Danielle J. Brown/Maryland Matters).
According to the bill, the commission would assess federal, state and local policies between 1877 and 1965, informally known as the post-Reconstruction and Jim Crow eras. Those years “have led to economic disparities based on race, including housing segregation and discrimination, redlining, restrictive covenants, and tax policies.”
The commission would also examine how public and private institutions may have benefited from those policies.
“This bill is needed because of the history of slavery in Maryland and the role that our state that we live in played,” said Peña-Melnyk, chair of the Health and Government Operations Committee that reviewed and advanced the bill Friday.
After Fisher pleaded with his colleagues “to vote for your conscience” and accept the amendment, the House rejected his proposal 99-37.
The chamber also rejected an amendment from Del. Ryan Nawrocki (R-Baltimore County), who sought to add individuals or ancestors who “were Union soldiers or otherwise fought to end slavery.”
“It would include those individuals into this conversation about reparations for the significant work that they did, frankly, to correct a wrong here in this county,” he said.
Peña-Melnyk said she received Nawrocki’s amendment “right now at this moment, which is no courtesy. Does not allow one to prepare adequately. If you come to HGO [the committee], I give you respect. I expect the same.”

As for the amendment, she said Black soldiers faced economic, housing and other forms of discrimination compared to white soldiers. She said Black soldiers faced discrimination when they returned home from war.
“The Black soldiers couldn’t get those loans. They could not start a business,” Peña-Melnyk said. “We’re talking about restricted covenants that did not apply to white people. It applied to Black people.”
The House voted 100-34 against Nawrocki’s amendment.

(Max McCoy/Kansas Reflector)This past decade or so, I have considered myself an increasingly engaged voter in Kansas. I work in education and have lived in this area for more than 20 years. My kids attended the surrounding public schools, and my family works and volunteers in this community.
What happens in Kansas matters to me.
With so much uncertainty in government lately, I’ve been paying close attention to local and state politics. After watching the disastrous town hall meeting held by Sen. Roger Marshall in distant Oakley, I decided to request forums from my state-level elected officials, Rep. Carl Turner and Sen. Kellie Warren. After all, they are voting on a lot of important matters that affect my family and my neighbors. Voter rights, school funding and policy, judicial matters. The list goes on.
I was curious: Would they even be open to a town hall meeting? Would they handle it differently than Marshall? Would they help ease voters’ minds or add to the discontent and uncertainty?
I began by emailing requests for town hall meetings to Turner and Warren, whose crew frequently canvassed for votes in my neighborhood during elections. I offered to help facilitate a town hall if they would agree to make an appearance — something I have no idea how to do but figured I would learn — if they said yes.
It’s been a little more than four weeks as I write this column, and I have yet to hear back about scheduling a town hall or meeting with either of them.
I have continued to send email requests at the start of every week. I have called their offices. A representative in Warren’s Topeka office advised me that she was “really busy with everything going on” but assured me my letter would be printed out and placed upon her desk for review. I’ve heard nothing.
Turner replied to one email regarding his stance on Senate Bill 4, which eliminates the three-day grace period for mail-in ballots. While he didn’t offer a town hall, he did offer to meet with me. Progress. Or so I believed. When I replied that I would like to meet, Turner did not respond to my email.
If I can’t connect with them, how do I know they are listening to any of their constituents?
Our elected officials, who were busy knocking on doors in October, making appearances and kissing babies all over town, are nowhere to be found now. I could not easily find updates from them in newsletters or social media posts, either. Even so, newsletters wouldn’t be enough. The lack of even an automated reply to a constituent week after week is inexcusable.
Their inaccessibility to Kansans is worrisome. They are voting on issues that affect Kansans and the neighborhoods they live in. We deserve more.
The area where I live in southern Johnson County has allowed Turner and Warren to become invisible. They live in our neighborhoods; their children may have attended schools in the community, or we run into them at a grocery store or at church. Some of us may be friends with them. But don’t give them a pass to not listen. They are our neighbors and promised to govern for us.
Our elected officials, especially those embedded in our neighborhoods, should make it a priority to connect with our community and let their constituents know that they care about what we have to say outside of an election year.
Kansans should demand more from leaders. I guess the problem lies in finding them first.

There’s no more fundamental task for a school than teaching kids to read.
But what about kids living in poverty? Don’t schools need more money, and more staff, to be able to get good results?
Well, yes and no. Poverty is certainly correlated to reading scores, and the best evidence suggests money helps boost a range of student outcomes.
But that doesn’t mean the best school district in the country is the most well-resourced or the one with the fanciest buildings or most prestigious alumni. In fact, based on how much students learn — which, in my opinion, is how schools should be evaluated — there’s perhaps no better district in the country than Steubenville, Ohio.

Last fall, I worked with The 74’s Art & Technology Director Eamonn Fitzmaurice to find districts where students had high reading scores despite serving large concentrations of low-income students. We highlighted Steubenville, a high-poverty district in Ohio’s Rust Belt, as a true outlier. (In a follow-up piece, we showed that Steubenville was also exceptional at teaching kids math.)

But I wanted to revisit the case of Steubenville after it was spotlighted recently on Emily Hanford’s award-winning “Sold a Story” podcast. Are its results just a one-time fluke? And if not — if the results are real — what can other districts learn from Steubenville’s success?
First, it’s quickly apparent that Steubenville is not a flash in the pan. A 2012 Hechinger Report story noted that its success traces back to the early 2000s.
It’s also incredibly consistent over time. I used the Zelma tool from the Education Data Center to look at its recent results. The graph below compares Steubenville’s third-grade reading proficiency rates (in blue) to the statewide average (in gray). As the graph shows, Steubenville consistently gets 95% to 99% of its third graders over the proficiency bar. In 2018, it had a bad year, and “only” 93% of third graders scored proficient. But the district did not suffer much of a drop-off in the wake of the pandemic, hitting 97% in spring 2022.

Steubenville’s results are also remarkably strong across student groups. Last year, for example, 100% of its Black students, 99% of its low-income students and 92% of its students with disabilities scored proficient in third grade reading.
How does Steubenville get such remarkable results? What can other districts learn from its success?
It’s not that the district has extra money or more staff. Steubenville spent $10,718 per student last year, which was about $1,500 less than the average Ohio district and well below many other districts in America. It also had slightly more students per teacher than other comparable districts.
Some things Steubenville does have are not easily replicable. As Robert Pondiscio pointed out in a recent column, the district can boast incredible continuity: It has been following the same reading program, called Success for All, for the last 25 years. Teacher turnover is low, and the same superintendent has been in place for a decade.
But Hanford found a few things that Steubenville did differently that other schools can learn from. Steubenville, for example, offers subsidized preschool beginning at age 3. And in those early years, teachers regularly remind students to speak in complete sentences as language practice for later, when those kids will start learning to read and write.
The district also deploys staff differently than most do. Every elementary teacher, even the phys ed instructor, leads a reading class. And during that reading block — which all students have at the same time — children are grouped with peers performing at the same level, regardless of age.
Steubenville kids are also practicing constantly, either as part of the whole class or in small groups, where kids work on their fluency skills by reading aloud to each other. That stands in contrast to schools that prefer to give kids silent reading or “Drop Everything and Read” time, which can be great for kids who already read well but wasteful or even harmful for children who aren’t ready for long blocks of independent free reading.
Now, it’s worth noting that Steubenville’s robust education results have not guaranteed kids a path to economic security. Despite its near-perfect early reading scores, strong middle and high school achievement and a 96% graduation rate, the district’s post-high school results are only slightly above statewide averages in terms of college-going and completion rates and the percentage of graduates who find “gainful employment.”
But those early adulthood outcomes are at least partly tied to the economic climate in a given community, and it’s hard to find fault with anything that the school district itself directly controls. Most districts would envy Steubenville’s impressive results.

Sears/Maryland Matters)The Senate Tuesday passed a package of energy reform bills that would set in motion a variety of electricity generation projects  — from solar to nuclear to natural gas — start long-term energy-supply planning efforts and give ratepayers a slight rebate.
The goal, legislators say, is to eventually tamp down skyrocketing electric costs with a host of policy prescriptions — and also give residential ratepayers, on average, an $80 refund on their electric bills in the next fiscal year.
“What we know is that every dollar matters,” said Senate President Bill Ferguson (D-Baltimore City), “and so we are doing what we have immediately available of ratepayer money and returning it to ratepayers in the most efficient way that we can, while focusing on the longer term, complex problem of increasing generation, and making it cleaner.”
The bills backed by legislative leaders passed the chamber virtually untouched, but collectively garnered nearly three hours of debate. They now move to the House for consideration, with Monday’s end to the legislative session looming.
Ferguson said Tuesday that leaders in the two chambers are closely aligned on the bills.
“It’s hard conversations, because these are really complex topics, and I think that we’ve really gotten to a good spot of general agreement,” Ferguson said. “There are going to be changes here and there, things around multiyear rate plans. I think we’re going to be OK.”
General Assembly energy package a mixed bag for environmental groups

Four Republican senators voted in favor of the broadest bill of the bunch, the Next Generation Energy Act, which included the ratepayer reimbursement, “fast track” proceedings for new power generation facilities and an end to a controversial subsidy for trash incinerators that create energy.
Sen. Justin D. Ready (R-Carroll and Frederick), the chamber’s minority whip, said he’d be voting against the bill, in part because he felt it should have done more to repay ratepayers for what he called the state’s flawed renewable energy policy. He argued the bill should have included further incentives for natural gas power plants, calling the fuel “nature’s gift.”
But, speaking on the Senate floor Tuesday evening, Ready said there were redeeming parts of the bill.
“My vote is going to be red. I think there could be some members of my caucus that vote green, and that’s a fine vote too,” Ready said.
Attracting significant debate Tuesday was a bill to create uniform standards for solar projects in Maryland, including requirements that they be fenced off, set back from nearby buildings and surrounded by trees and shrubs.
The bill came in response to concerns that Maryland’s patchwork of varying local regulations on solar were pushing solar developers away, said Sen. Brian J. Feldman (D-Montgomery), chairman of the Senate’s Education, Energy and the Environment Committee.
“We’re retiring oil and coal plants, so we are in a bit of a pickle,” Feldman said. “If we let every local commissioner group or city council have veto authority about any energy project anywhere in the state we’re going to have even a bigger problem.”
Currently, the Maryland Public Service Commission has final say on all solar projects that generate 2 megawatts or more of electricity. In other words, the state commission, which regulates utilities, can overrule local authorities to approve a solar project in a community.
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
But Feldman said the bill would do something “unprecedented” to limit the commission’s broad authority: It would limit solar generating stations to 5% of “priority preservation areas” in the state, which are lands capable of supporting agricultural or forestry operations.
Republican senators expressed concerns about preserving the character of rural areas and ensuring fields aren’t permanently lost to solar panels. In turn, they made several attempts to lower the 5% cap, but their efforts failed to win Democratic support.
“We’re talking about utility-scale solar that is eating up much of agricultural fields and lands in especially the Eastern Shore of Maryland,” said Sen. Steve Hershey (R-Upper Shore), the minority leader.
An attempt by Sen. Johnny Mautz (R-Middle Shore) to lower the cap to 2% failed, as did Hershey’s proposal to start the cap at 2% before later raising it to 5%  — so long as solar arrays were spread equally around the state.
“This is a very simple amendment. It’s reasonable … It just says it has to be done equally around the state,” Mautz said. “We just want to be treated fairly. That’s all we want.”
Republican senators also took issue with pieces of the broader energy bill proposed by leadership, the Next Generation Energy Act, although they generally agreed with the premise that the state needs more in-state energy supply to reduce consumer costs and the state’s reliance on large transmission lines.
When it came to light last year, a new power transmission line expected to cut through rural portions of Baltimore, Carroll and Frederick counties drew considerable community pushback. The proposed Maryland Piedmont Reliability Project was necessitated in part by the retirement of Maryland coal-fired poewer plants Brandon Shores and H.A. Wagner, as well as an increase in energy demand, including from power-hungry data centers in Northern Virginia.
In one amendment, Maryland Republicans proposed sending more direct relief to residential ratepayers than the expected $80 in fiscal 2026.
The bill brought to the floor Tuesday would pull a one-time chunk from the Strategic Energy Investment Fund, which utilities pay into when they fail to comply with a state law that requires them to pay for a certain amount of renewable energy.
Hershey’s attempt to make consumer payments permanent failed.
“We’re getting a lot of phone calls and emails. It’s not because somebody’s bill went up $40, but it went up multiple hundreds of dollars,” Hershey said.
Lawmakers’ touted electric bill refund would average $81 per household

Hershey also tried to add language limiting multiyear rate plans for utilities, which let power companies propose several years of rate increases in a row. The bill that reached the Senate floor Tuesday would prevent multiyear rate plans unless they show a benefit to ratepayers.
Hershey suggested eliminating the mutliyear plans altogether, arguing that the state should return to “traditional” year-by-year ratemaking. But Democrats disagreed, arguing that multiyear ratemaking could allow utilities to save customers money by planning ahead for costs.
“If they are able to use it in the right way, we want this tool to be on the table,” said Sen. Malcolm Augustine (D-Prince George’s). “Now, what we are not going to allow is for them to then just use this as a piggy bank.”
Republicans also saw an opening to try and amend the state’s Renewable Portfolio Standard, which requires utilities to meet a minimum percentage of their electricity sales with renewable energy sources, for which they purchase credits from generators of approved renewable energy.
The bill removes trash incinerators, also known as waste-to-energy facilities, from the list. They were added to the list in 2011.
Hershey argued the Senate should lower the required renewable energy percentage by 15% — approximately the amount that incinerators contributed as of the most recent report. But Augustine disagreed, arguing that renewable energy projects coming online in the future would “fill this gap.”
“The committee made a policy decision that the state of Maryland no longer felt that waste-to-energy was an appropriate part of the renewable energy portfolio,” Augustine said.",https://marylandmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/DSC_0010-1024x683.jpeg,,,2025-04-02 04:58:59.359349

Under an emerging Republican plan to require some Medicaid recipients to work, between 4.6 million and 5.2 million adults ages 19 to 55 could lose their health care coverage, according to a new analysis.
The study, conducted by Urban Institute researchers with support from the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation, calculated that up to 39% of the 13.3 million adults in that age group who became eligible for Medicaid when their states expanded the program under the Affordable Care Act would lose coverage if Congress required states to impose work rules.
The report suggests that most of those people would lose coverage not because they aren’t complying with the rules, but because they would struggle to report their compliance to the state.
“Most adults who would lose eligibility for federal Medicaid funding are working, engaged in work-related activities, or could qualify for exemptions not readily identifiable through state databases but could still face disenrollment because of the reporting requirements,” it states. The study identified several barriers to reporting, including lack of broadband access and lack of transportation.
Forty states plus the District of Columbia have expanded Medicaid under the ACA. Overall, nearly 72 million people, about a fifth of Americans, are enrolled in the program for low-income people, which is funded jointly by the federal government and the states.
Medicaid cuts could hurt older adults who rely on home care, nursing homes

Traditional Medicaid insurance was mainly available to children and their caregivers, people with disabilities and pregnant women. But the ACA, commonly known as Obamacare, allowed states to extend coverage to adults making up to 138% of the federal poverty level — about $21,000 a year for a single person.
Nationwide, more than 21 million people with low incomes have health insurance because of expanded Medicaid eligibility.
U.S. House Republicans in February pushed through a budget plan, now under consideration in the Senate, that would require about $880 billion in cuts to Medicaid over the next decade to help cover the cost of $4.5 trillion in tax cuts. The budget doesn’t contain specifics on how that target would be met. But work requirements are a likely money-saving option: A 2023 analysis from the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office found that imposing work rules on Medicaid recipients ages 19 to 55 who are not parents or caregivers would cut federal spending by an estimated $109 billion over the next 10 years.
The Congressional Budget Office based that projection on a plan the GOP-controlled U.S. House approved in 2023. That bill, the likely blueprint for the work requirements Republicans are considering now, would have required adults ages 19-55 to work, participate in a job training program or perform community service for at least 80 hours per month for three or more months in a calendar year. Parents and caretakers of dependent children, and those unable to work because of a health condition, would have been exempt.
Many Republican-led states are eager to impose work requirements on able-bodied Medicaid recipients. Thirteen states received permission to impose work rules on at least some Medicaid enrollees during the first Trump administration. Nine additional states requested permission to enact Medicaid work requirements during Trump’s earlier term but had not won approval by the time it ended.
When the Biden administration came into office, it rescinded all the approvals.
Supporters say requiring Medicaid recipients to work, study or train for a career gives them a boost toward self-sufficiency and financial stability. Critics, however, say such rules end up hurting far more people than they help.
Medicaid cuts could hurt older adults who rely on home care, nursing homes

The researchers from the Urban Institute mostly based their analysis on the experience of Arkansas, which in June 2018 became the first state to require some Medicaid recipients to work, volunteer, go to school or participate in job training to receive benefits. By the time a federal judge halted the policy in April 2019, 18,000 adults had lost coverage.
The researchers also looked at New Hampshire, which began implementing a work requirement but halted the program in July 2019 before suspending anyone’s coverage.
“What was found in a lot of qualitative research on the previous work requirement programs is that a lot of people were unaware of the policy, or they didn’t understand the policy,” said Michael Karpman, an Urban Institute researcher who co-authored the study.
“People who need coverage the most would do the most to try to maintain it. On the other hand, those people could also face the most difficulty with the administrative barriers,” Karpman said.
In a 2020 study examining how Arkansas’ last experience with work requirements played out, researchers from the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health “found no evidence that the policy succeeded in its stated goal of promoting work and instead found substantial evidence of harm to health care coverage and access.”
Arkansas Republican Gov. Sarah Huckabee Sanders announced in January that she would ask the federal government for permission to institute work requirements, regardless of what Congress decides. The state submitted the request last week.










Especially for a rural state like Arkansas, work requirements fail to take into account a lot of the realities that people may face.


– Christin Harper, policy director for Arkansas Advocates for Children and Families


Arkansas Republican state Rep. Aaron Pilkington, who serves on the health committee in his chamber, said lawmakers “learned our lesson from the last go-round.”
Pilkington said that under the new proposal, the state will only pause coverage instead of canceling it, giving recipients an opportunity to prove they are complying. And, he said, the online portal for reporting will be a lot more user-friendly.
“I think it’s a reasonable thing to ask for able-bodied people to look for work, or try to obtain work,” Pilkington said.
But Christin Harper, policy director for Arkansas Advocates for Children and Families, said even the new version would be a challenge for many enrollees. Many people on Medicaid are juggling multiple jobs, and having to report to the state every month would be a significant burden.
“Especially for a rural state like Arkansas, work requirements fail to take into account a lot of the realities that people may face,” Harper said. She added that “with the overall job market, job opportunities may or may not be available in some of these rural towns.”

One also bans state employees from receiving gender-affirming care on the state health plan.

State health plan ban gets inmate addition
Vidalia Republican Sen. Blake Tillery’s Senate Bill 39 passed through a House committee on a party line vote with a new amendment.
The original version of the bill, which had already passed the committee, barred transgender state employees or their dependents from receiving care on the state health insurance plan. The version that passed the House Health Committee Tuesday also specifically prohibits people in state correctional institutions from getting gender care.
There are currently about five people who are incarcerated in Georgia who receive this care, according to Cataula Republican Sen. Randy Robertson.
  Rep. Marvin Lim, right. Ross Williams/Georgia Recorder
Norcross Democratic Rep. Marvin Lim argued that removing transgender health care from the plan would violate the law.
The Atlanta Journal-Constitution reported in February that discrimination lawsuits and other complaints involving transgender people had cost taxpayers at least $4.1 million since 2015, including $2.1 million to settle claims and another $2 million in legal costs. Those numbers include $365,000 paid out in a 2023 settlement in which the state agreed to provide coverage for gender-affirming care and not to restrict it again.
“We feel very strongly that it would be an unconstitutional impairment of contracts to undo those settlements, let alone just an unconstitutional move to say that this wouldn’t violate Title VII, that this wouldn’t violate the equal protection clause,” he said.
  Rep. Brent Cox. Ross Williams/Georgia Recorder
Lim was referring to Title VII of the Civil Rights Act, which prohibits employers from discriminating based on an employee’s sex, which includes whether they are transgender, and the equal protection clause in the 14th Amendment.
Dawsonville Republican Rep. Brent Cox, who is sponsoring the bill in the Senate, indicated that the law will be a message to the state judicial branch that the Legislature wants it to be legal to ban transgender health care.
“My belief is that it clears up for the judicial branch to be able to work within these guidelines on how they’re going to rule and move forward,” he said.
Lim said he was not convinced.
“It is not enough for us to say this is our policy,” he said. “This is a violation of the U.S. Constitution and federal statutory law on anti-discrimination. So we can pass whatever law we want at the state level and say ‘the attorney general can’t do this, the Department of Community Health can’t do this.’ But the argument has always been that this is violating higher law, the federal law, and specifically the U.S. Constitution.”
Democrats on the committee also argued the language in the bill could eliminate mental health treatments for transgender people, which Cox said was a misinterpretation.
The bill will need to pass through both chambers before Friday’s final deadline if it is to become law.
Standalone ban on jail treatment
Around the same time the House Health Committee passed SB 39, the House Public and Community Health took up Robertson’s Senate Bill 185, which also bans gender-affirming care for inmates but does not affect state employees.
  Sen. Randy Robertson. Ross Williams/Georgia Recorder
Robertson’s bill passed out of the committee with a voice vote, teeing it for a potential final vote by the Legislature’s April 4 adjournment. Speaking to a reporter in the hallway after the committee approved his bill, Robertson said he hadn’t had time to see the latest revision on SB 39, but he supports Tillery’s state health plan ban and would likely be happy if either bill passed.
Republican supporters make the case that taxpayer money should not go toward gender-affirming care in state prisons.
“I understand individuals get upset when I say this, but I do mean it with all compassion: elective surgeries cannot be a part of our cost in the Georgia Department of Corrections,” Robertson said.
Opponents of the bill counter that gender-affirming care encompasses more than surgeries, is far from elective and can be necessary for a person’s wellbeing. Several speakers, including two attorneys with civil rights organizations, argued Tuesday that the measure is unconstitutional.
“If adopted, Senate Bill 185 would impose blanket bans on the provision of gender-affirming care to incarcerated people with gender dysphoria, regardless of needs,” said Emily C. R. Early with the Center for Constitutional Rights. “These blanket bans have repeatedly been found unconstitutional because they show deliberate indifference to the needs of incarcerated people.”
“This Senate bill puts lives at risk, and in so doing, would bring constitutional challenges,” she added.
Robertson was dismissive of those potential challenges to the state.
“We have the five individuals who are seeking the care, and then we have the lawsuits, and if you look at that, one of the failures within our system right now is the fact we do not have a policy against it,” Robertson said.
  Rep. Michelle Au.. Ross Williams/Georgia Recorder
Tuesday’s debate also veered into discussion about the origin of the slate of bills targeting transgender Georgians this year. There are at least five bills gaining traction, and lawmakers have spent hours deliberating on them and hearing public input on them, and they are spending the final days of the session trying to finalize them.
Rep. Michelle Au, a Johns Creek Democrat, said House Republican colleagues have told her that she should support Robertson’s bill because the issue of inmates receiving gender-affirming care is why former Vice President Kamala Harris lost the presidential election last year.
A leading Senate Democrat representing an Atlanta district caused an uproar last month when she joined three other Democrats who voted for Robertson’s bill.
“That comment has been made to me several times, and I just have to put on the record that I really resent a subset of our patient population being used in this way for clearly political reasons, and I really wish that you would not put your voice behind this bill,” Au said to Robertson.
Robertson said politics wasn’t the motivation for him. But Rep. Scott Hilton, a Peachtree Corners Republican, acknowledged the influence of the 2024 election.
“Politics does inform policy as much as that politics reflect what our communities want,” Hilton said. “And I think if anything this last cycle, we learned that this was an 80/20 issue, not just in Georgia, but frankly America, and that folks were flabbergasted to learn that a small segment of our population opposed policies like this.”
But Bentley Hudgins, state director with the Human Rights Campaign, argued that exit polling showed that transgender issues ranked low on the list of voter priorities.
“We have seen time and time again in history where powerful people have used public opinion to excuse crimes against humanity,” Hudgins said.
“I do want to challenge that notion that just because, even if it were true that the majority of people think that this is a popular issue, it doesn’t give you the right to pass it.”

(Photo by William J. Ford/Maryland Matters)The Senate gave final approval Tuesday to its version of a bill making changes to the Blueprint for Maryland’s Future, the state’s 10-year, multibillion-dollar education reform plan.
The 33-13 vote sets up a conference committee with the House, which has approved its own version of the Excellence in Maryland Public Schools Act. The Senate also amended the House bill Tuesday to mirror its own version and now sends both bills to the lower chamber.
While it was largely expected, Tuesday’s party-line Senate vote was delayed for almost 25 minutes while senators debated an ultimately unsuccessful attempt to add language to the House bill that would prohibit transgender females from participating in women’s sports in school.
“This amendment is to simply ensure that there is a level playing field for girl’s sports at the high school level by allowing only biological girls to play on a high school interscholastic or intramural varsity or junior varsity team that is designated as a girls, female, or women’s team or sport,” said Sen.  Justin Ready (R-Frederick and Carroll), the Senate minority whip and sponsor of the proposed amendment.
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE“We want to protect the crucial role that women’s sports have played in development of young women,” said Ready, who said his wife participated in track and field in high school and at Salisbury University, where they met.
Sen. Ron Watson (D-Prince George’s), the floor manager for the bill, said he supported the concept of Ready’s amendment but that “it’s not germane to this bill.”
But Sen. Mary Beth Carozza (R-Lower Shore) supported the amendment, talking about her time as a tennis player in high school and at the Catholic University of America in Washington, D.C. She also read a letter from a volleyball player at her alma mater, Stephen Decatur High School in Berlin.
“While the other team was warming up, my teammates and I immediately noticed the strength and speed with which the biological male hit the volleyball,” Carozza read. “It was apparent that the skills of the biological male surpassed anyone else on the court. My teammates and I were not only intimidated, but we feared for our safety.”
Sen. Mary Washington (D-Baltimore City and Baltimore County), the first openly gay African-American member of the Maryland General Assembly and still only one in the Senate, also read a letter from a high school student. But this one highlighted came from the only female player on a co-ed soccer team who said she was “bullied, ridiculed and harassed for six years.”

“If you want girls sports to be more fair, there are other ways to do it. But it’s my belief that the people who don’t want transgender women in sports and pass bills … should instead focus on providing more support for women in these other spaces,” Washington read, before voting against the amendment.
“In not allowing transgender girls to participate in women’s sports, we continue a long history of policing women’s bodies,” Washington said.
Even Senate President Bill Ferguson (D-Baltimore City) offered a few words before he voted against the amendment.
“When I’ve had conversations with transgender young people who are trying to find themselves and live in a community, the pain and suffering that so many of them have felt, feeling out of place and not having a spot in this world is unbelievably painful,” he said. “So, when I think about how we should be educating kids, it should be about what is in the best interest of children.”
The Senate voted 27-17 to reject the amendment, before voting to make the House bill conform to the Senate version.
Local school officials have long asked for more flexibility in the implementation of the Blueprint, now in its third year, and with the state facing a $3 billion budget shortfall this year, many targeted the school reform plan as an area for savings. Gov. Wes Moore (D) in January proposed a bill that deferred the start of some programs in the Blueprint and would slow the pace of some budget planned budget increases.
The House approved its version of the Blueprint reform bill earlier this month, rejecting cuts in per pupil funding and eliminating a four-year pause on the implementation of teacher collaborative time, both elements in the governor’s plan. The House voted for a one-year pause in the start of collaborative time.
The Senate bill is more closely aligned with the governor’s bill on the per pupil funding and collaborative time provisions.
House members are expected to reject the Senate’s changes to the House bill, creating the need for a conference committee to work out compromise language between the two chambers. That agreement will need to come before Monday night, the closing day of the 2025 General Assembly session,",https://marylandmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Sen.-Justin-Ready-4-1-2025-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-04-02 04:00:51.642733

(Photo by Baylor Spears/Wisconsin Examiner)Dane County Judge Susan Crawford was elected to the Wisconsin Supreme Court Tuesday, solidifying liberal control of the body until 2028 and marking a sharp rebuke by the state’s voters of the policies of President Donald Trump and the financial might of his most prominent adviser, Elon Musk.
Crawford rode massive turnout in Dane and Milwaukee counties and outperformed Kamala Harris’ effort last year in a number of other parts of the state to defeat her opponent, Waukesha County Judge Brad Schimel by about 11 points.
The former chief legal counsel for Democratic Gov. Jim Doyle who represented liberal groups such as Planned Parenthood and the Madison teacher’s union as a private practice attorney said during the campaign that she would look out for the rights of all Wisconsinites on the Supreme Court while repeatedly criticizing Schimel for his eagerness to show his support for Trump, his record as attorney general and the outside assistance his campaign got from Musk.
Crawford’s victory marks the third straight Supreme Court election for Wisconsin’s liberals and maintains the 4-3 liberal majority that has been in place since Justice Janet Protasiewicz was elected in 2023. Crawford will replace retiring Justice Ann Walsh Bradley.
Since gaining control of the Court, the new liberal majority has ruled that the state’s previous legislative maps were unconstitutional, ending the partisan gerrymander that had locked in Republican control of the Legislature for more than a decade, and accepted cases that will decide the rights of Wisconsinites to have an abortion. The Court is also likely to consider a challenge to Wisconsin’s 2011 law stripping most union rights from public employees within the next year or two.
“I’m here tonight because I’ve spent my life fighting to do what’s right,” Crawford said after the race was called for her. “That’s why I got into this race, to protect the fundamental rights and freedoms of all.”
Schimel said he got into the race because he was opposed to the “partisanship” of the liberal controlled Court but his effort to nationalize the race and show his support for Trump proved unsuccessful against a backlash to the second Trump term and voters’ distrust of Musk, who offered cash incentives for people who got out the vote for Schimel.
Tuesday’s election was the first statewide race in the country since Trump won the presidency last fall. Trump narrowly won Wisconsin and in counties across the state, Schimel failed to match the president’s vote total. In La Crosse County, Crawford performed 11 points better than Harris did last year and Schimel didn’t even match Trump’s vote share in his home of Waukesha County.
Schimel ran nearly even with former Supreme Court Justice Dan Kelly, who lost to Protasiewicz in the 2023 race. Wisconsin’s conservatives have now lost the past three Supreme Court elections by double digits.
The 2025 Wisconsin Supreme Court race set the record for the most expensive judicial campaign in U.S. history, topping the $100 million mark. While Crawford received support from liberal billionaires including George Soros and Illinois Gov. J.B. Pritzker, Musk dwarfed all other contributors, dumping more than $20 million into the race.
Musk’s money helped blanket the state’s airwaves with attack ads against Crawford’s record as a judge, often criticizing sentences she gave to people convicted of sexual violence. A Musk-associated PAC also hired people to knock on thousands of doors in an effort to turn out Trump’s base of Wisconsin voters, who have often sat out non-presidential elections. America PAC, a political action committee associated with Musk, paid door knockers $25 an hour, offered voters cash if they filled out a petition against “activist judges” and gave two people $1 million checks at a rally on Sunday.
“But I’ve got to tell you, as a little girl growing up in Chippewa Falls, I never could have imagined that I’d be taking on the richest man in the world  for justice in Wisconsin,” Crawford said. “And we won.”
In a concession speech delivered shortly before 9:30 p.m., Schimel told supporters they “didn’t leave anything on the field,” and when a few began to complain said “no, we’ve gotta accept this.”
“The numbers aren’t going to turn around. Too bad. We’re not going to pull this off,” he said. “So thank you guys. From the bottom of my heart. God bless you. God bless the state of Wisconsin. God bless America. You will rise again. We’ll get up to fight another day, it just wasn’t our day.”
The Democratic Party of Wisconsin, harnessing voters’ alarm at the actions Musk has been leading from his federal DOGE office to cut government programs and fire thousands of public employees, held People v. Musk town halls across the state where residents said they were worried about the effect those cuts would have on services they rely on like Medicaid, Social Security, veteran’s benefits and education funding.
Gov. Tony Evers said that Wisconsin “felt the weight of America” in this election, which proved Wisconsinites “will not be bought.”
“This election was about the resilience of the Wisconsin and American values that define and unite us,” Evers said. “This election was about doing what’s best for our kids, protecting constitutional checks and balances, reaffirming our faith in the courts and the judiciary, and defending against attacks on the basic rights, freedoms, and institutions we hold dear. But above all, this election was as much about who Wisconsinites believe we can be as it was about the country we believe we must be.”
Democrats and Crawford accused Musk of trying to buy a seat on the state Supreme Court, partially to influence a lawsuit his company, Tesla, has filed challenging a Wisconsin law that prohibits car manufacturers from selling directly to consumers. Musk said he was focused on the race because the Court could decide the constitutionality of the state’s congressional maps, which currently favor Republicans and help the party hold a narrow majority in the U.S. House of Representatives.
At the victory party, Democratic Party of Wisconsin Chair Ben Wikler compared the effort against Musk and Trump to Gov. Robert “Fighting Bob” La Follette’s fight against the oligarchs of the early 20th century, adding that Republicans’ association with Musk will be an “anchor.”
“I think what Susan Crawford did by making clear that Elon Musk was the real opponent in this race, what voters did by responding to Elon Musk, it made clear that Elon Musk is politically toxic, and he is a massive anchor that will drag Republicans from the bottom of the ocean,” he said. “And that’s a message that I hope Republicans in Washington hear as fast as possible. Not only will they lose, but they will deserve to lose resoundingly and they will be swept out of power in a wave of outrage across the nation.”
On the campaign trail, Crawford sought to tie Schimel to Musk — she called her opponent “Elon Schimel” at the only debate between the two candidates — while portraying herself as the less partisan candidate. Throughout the nominally non-partisan race, both candidates lobbed accusations of extreme political views at the other.
With Crawford’s victory and the retention of the Court’s liberal majority, the body is expected to rule on cases that ask if Wisconsin’s Constitution grants women the right to access an abortion, the legality of the Republican-authored law that restricts the collective bargaining rights of most public employees, how Wisconsin’s industries should be regulated for pollution and the legality of the state’s congressional maps.
Heather Williams, a spokesperson for the Democratic Legislative Campaign Committee, said in a statement that Democrats were offering a better vision for the country than the one promised by Schimel, Trump and Musk.
“Despite Republicans’ best efforts to buy this seat, Wisconsin voters showed up for their values and future,” Williams said. “While Trump dismantles programs that taxpayers have earned, support, and are counting on, voters across the country are turning to state Democrats who are delivering on promises to lower costs and expand opportunities.”

Photo by Baylor Spears/Wisconsin Examiner. Dane County Judge Susan Crawford was elected to the Wisconsin Supreme Court Tuesday, solidifying liberal control of the body until 2028 and marking a sharp rebuke by the state’s voters of the policies of President Donald Trump and the financial might of his most prominent adviser, Elon Musk.
Crawford rode massive turnout in Dane and Milwaukee counties and outperformed Kamala Harris’ effort last year in a number of other parts of the state to defeat her opponent, Waukesha County Judge Brad Schimel by about 11 points.
The former chief legal counsel for Democratic Gov. Jim Doyle who represented liberal groups such as Planned Parenthood and the Madison teacher’s union as a private practice attorney said during the campaign that she would look out for the rights of all Wisconsinites on the Supreme Court while repeatedly criticizing Schimel for his eagerness to show his support for Trump, his record as attorney general and the outside assistance his campaign got from Musk.
Crawford’s victory marks the third straight Supreme Court election for Wisconsin’s liberals and maintains the 4-3 liberal majority that has been in place since Justice Janet Protasiewicz was elected in 2023. Crawford will replace retiring Justice Ann Walsh Bradley.
Since gaining control of the Court, the new liberal majority has ruled that the state’s previous legislative maps were unconstitutional, ending the partisan gerrymander that had locked in Republican control of the Legislature for more than a decade, and accepted cases that will decide the rights of Wisconsinites to have an abortion. The Court is also likely to consider a challenge to Wisconsin’s 2011 law stripping most union rights from public employees within the next year or two.
“I’m here tonight because I’ve spent my life fighting to do what’s right,” Crawford said after the race was called for her. “That’s why I got into this race, to protect the fundamental rights and freedoms of all.”

Despite outspending Ewing by hundreds of thousands of dollars, former State Sen. Mike McDonnell finished a distant third after angering key parts of both major political parties. 
The Nebraska Democratic Party censured the then-Democrat last year for casting the critical vote to pass new restrictions on abortion and transgender health care. He also angered the right by withholding his vote for shifting Nebraska to winner-take-all in presidential elections after joining the Nebraska Republican Party.
Contentious campaign
McDonnell, who ran for mayor as a Republican, has been highly critical of the incumbent GOP mayor, attempting as a longtime union leader to outflank her on the right. 
Community activist Jasmine Harris finished fourth after pledging to focus on public safety through investing more in community-based programs. Terry Brewer, the founding pastor of New Covenant Church of God in Christ in North Omaha, finished fifth in the primary election.

Much of the race discussed the city’s streetcar project, taxes, and housing costs.
Stothert is seeking a fourth term as the city’s top elected official, a record in the modern era. She has emphasized her record of results, including changes to make downtown Omaha more appealing and encouraging redeveloping parts of the city that had lagged. While the mayor’s race is nonpartisan, local parties have campaigned for central candidates. 
“Our campaign has been built around our record of progress, determination, and the successes we’ve had,” Stothert said after the first batch of election results. “That’s the positive message we will continue to deliver for the next six weeks.”
McDonnell heavily criticized Stothert during the campaign, emphasizing the streetcar, homelessness, spending and the poor quality of city streets. Stothert won anyway.
Stothert, Ewing lead unofficial results
As of the 10:25 p.m. results in Douglas County, she had 25,056 votes. Ewing had 21,623 votes. And McDonnell had 13,859 votes according to unofficial election results.

McDonnell conceded the race before 10 p.m., saying he was “proud” of his campaign because he was “listening to the people.”
Ewing has been the Douglas County treasurer for almost two decades and was a former member of the Omaha Police Department. He has campaigned to improve city infrastructure, public transit, development and create more jobs.
“We believed all along that we were going to be in the general election. We believe that citizens of this community appreciate good government,” Ewing told the Nebraska Examiner.
Douglas County Election Commissioner Brian Kruse had anticipated a voter turnout slightly above average for the local race. 
McDonnell made noise
McDonnell is known statewide for his stint in the Nebraska Legislature, where he opposed Republicans’ 11th-hour push for winner-take-all before the 2024 presidential election. He also helped Republicans pass the state’s stricter law banning abortion after 12 weeks of gestational age.  
He spent much of his campaign railing against the Omaha streetcar project favored by Stothert and downtown Omaha businesses, including Mutual of Omaha. Other candidates echoed McDonnell’s criticism of the $459 million project, but said it was too far along to stop without the city facing legal and financial risk.
Ewing told the Flatwater Free Press that the project needs to continue, but that city residents should have been able to vote on it.

The Nebraska Democratic Party got one of its two endorsed candidates through with Ewing. Gov. Jim Pillen and U.S. Sen. Pete Ricketts, R-Neb, endorsed Stothert. The Douglas County Republican Party endorsed McDonnell.
Stothert and Ewing are likely to increase their leads Friday, when Kruse’s county election office will count about 7,000 outstanding early votes turned in on Election Day. Those typically follow the same pattern as the first round of counted early votes that Kruse released at 8 p.m. Tuesday, which showed Stothert leading, Ewing second and McDonnell third.
Harris said that the results weren’t what she had hoped for, but she would continue to prioritize the people of Omaha.
“I’ll continue to do the work in front of me, and I look forward to others joining in on how we can continue to build an Omaha that works for everyone, regardless if it’s an elected seat or not,” Harris told the Examiner. 
The general election is set for May 13.

(Zach Wendling/Nebraska Examiner)LINCOLN — Following a lengthy and contentious debate, the Legislature on Tuesday advanced an effort to weaken and add exceptions to the minimum wage increase Nebraska voters approved by ballot measure in 2022.
In a 32-17 vote, state legislators pushed onto the next stage of lawmaking an amended Legislative Bill 258 championed by businesswoman and State Sen. Jane Raybould of Lincoln.
At times, the debate got personal, with colleagues on the left pointing barbs at Raybould.

Raybould’s family owns B&R Stores, which owns Russ’s Market, Super Saver and more in the state. Her last day as company vice president was Monday, the same day debate began on her bill. She had filed a conflict of interest statement after introducing LB 258, her 2025 priority bill, earlier this year.
“When my colleagues want to beat up on me, please do, I can take it,” Raybould said during debate. “I am proud of my work and service to my community and my state over these years, and I will stand up for a balanced approach to creating good policy that keeps our Nebraska families safe, healthy and, most importantly, employed with benefits and competitive wages.”
The coalition behind the successful 2022 campaign said Raybould’s bill could lead to Nebraska wages falling behind increasing costs of living.
“We are very discouraged by the Nebraska Legislature, once again, standing in direct opposition to the will of the majority of Nebraska voters,” the Raise the Wage Nebraska coalition said in a statement.
‘I want the accountability’
Rough waters may be ahead, though, for the effort as 33 votes are needed to get the bill over the finish line. Freshman State Sen. Stan Clouse, the former Kearney mayor, voted to cease debate but against advancing the bill. Raybould would need his vote, or another, for her bill to pass. Amending voter-approved laws requires at least 33 votes.
Raybould said after the vote that she was not worried and already was working on a way to cinch the necessary support. She said she felt attacked and had never heard colleague State Sen. Danielle Conrad, a fellow Lincoln Democrat, “beat up anybody as badly as she said terrible things about me.”











I want the accountability. I want the record to show who you are.


– State Sen. Danielle Conrad of Lincoln



The current Legislature’s most veteran lawmaker, with 11 years in the post, Conrad said she stood up for the will of the voters and did not view young workers as “subhuman” subject to subminimum wages. 
Among Raybould’s proposed changes is the creation of a new and lesser minimum wage for youths ages 14 and 15. Federal law sets many restrictions on these youth workers, such as requiring non-hazardous or non-manufacturing jobs and prohibitions on duties the workers can perform.
“When’s it enough?” asked Conrad of voter support. Of 49 legislative districts, a majority of voters in 38 districts supported the ballot language Raybould’s bill would change. Raybould’s constituents were the fifth highest in support.
“I want the accountability,” Conrad said.  “I want the record to show who you are.”
Proposed changes
The ballot initiative voters handily approved in 2022 gradually increased the minimum wage by $1.50 a year until it reaches $15 an hour by Jan. 1, 2026. The minimum wage after that is to adjust annually based on the Consumer Price Index to account for cost of living increases.

Raybould’s amended LB 258 instead would:

Increase the minimum wage annually by up to 1.5%, beginning in January 2027, based on the Midwest CPI.


For youth workers ages 14 and 15, a $13.50 minimum wage would increase by 1.5% in January 2030 and every fifth year after. Emancipated minors are excluded. There is no such provision in state law currently.


Adjust the optional 90-day training wage for new workers ages 16, 17, 18 and 19 to $13.50 an hour through the end of 2026 and, starting in January 2027, the wage would increase by 1.5% each year. Emancipated minors are excluded. (Currently, an employer may pay a new employee younger than 20, and who is not a seasonal or migrant worker, a training wage of at least 75% of the federal minimum wage for 90 days from the date of hire, or $5.44.)

Those who opposed the changes argued that the Legislature should respect the nearly 6-to-4 vote for specific language for raising the minimum wage over time. They said carving out exceptions could hurt lower-income workers struggling to make ends meet.
Those who backed the Raybould proposal said that finessing ballot actions is within the Legislature’s purview and can help ensure laws are workable. They said the proposed changes protect small businesses and the jobs they provide.
‘Sad state of affairs’
The fiery debate that stretched over a couple of days revealed deep frustration amidst factions in the Legislature.
“This has been on the books, and there has not been any need to walk it back,” State Sen. George Dungan of Lincoln said of the minimum wage law. “There has not been any catastrophic effect.”










I will stand up for a balanced approach to creating good policy that keeps our Nebraska families safe, healthy and, most importantly, employed with benefits and competitive wages.


– State Sen. Jane Raybould of Lincoln


State Sen. Terrell McKinney of North Omaha described the current year as his worst in the Legislature.
“We wonder why people don’t get out and vote,” he said. “We come in here and we work against them. That is sad. It’s a sad state of affairs for the Nebraska Legislature.”
Conrad said she has never seen morale as low as it has been this legislative session.
“The frustration,” she said, “is that you shouldn’t have to explain basic civics to adult state senators.”
  State Sen. Megan Hunt of Omaha. March 31, 2025. (Zach Wendling/Nebraska Examiner)
State Sen. Megan Hunt of Omaha said the minimum wage initiative did not see any organized opposition in 2022 because, she said, those interests knew they’d find “stooges” in the Legislature to push their agenda.
She took aim at lawmakers for looking out for “personal business interests” and said voters did not vote to support a “second-tier wage” for certain workers. 
Said Hunt: “I have never seen such a blatant, bald-faced, self-serving, self-dealing, selfish, unethical example of self-dealing as this bill in the Legislature.”
Conrad, questioning Raybould’s transparency with constituents, asked if the lawmaker’s campaign materials pledged to change the will of voters and to “stick it to low-income working families.”
“If in fact that was part of your outreach in getting into this body, that’s a different story,” Conrad said.
Raybould was the lone Democrat to support the measure. Two Republicans, Clouse and State Sen. Dave Wordekemper of Fremont, opposed it. 
‘You haven’t done your homework’
Raybould said Nebraska currently has the 18th highest minimum wage in the U.S., but the 10th lowest cost of living. She suggested that colleagues talk with small businesses, including local daycare centers, nonprofits, grocers or retailers who she said are “struggling” on “shoestring budgets.”
If they did, she said, they would realize there are impacts from raising minimum wages so quickly — increased prices, decreased hours for workers and small businesses shuttering. If they don’t, Raybould told them, “You haven’t done your homework.”
In a reference to comedian Groucho Marx, Raybould said: “Who are you going to believe: Me or your own eyes?”
“I ask you: Take a moment. Reach out to them,” Raybould said. “Reach out to your local grocer who might be the next person to create a food desert in your rural community.”
  State Sen. Loren Lippincott of Central City. Aug. 8, 2024. (Zach Wendling/Nebraska Examiner)
State Sen. Loren Lippincott of Central City agreed, cautioning against job losses, particularly for low-skilled workers, and machines replacing workers.
“Businesses might invest in automation or technology to replace low-wage workers,” he said. “This could disproportionately affect workers in industries like retail or food service” or sectors with repetitive tasks that are easily automated.
State Sen. Kathleen Kauth of Omaha, who chairs the Legislature’s Business and Labor Committee that advanced Raybould’s bill, said she wasn’t in favor of the bill when the youth wage would have applied to older teen workers. But limiting the new, lower wage to 14 or 15 year olds, who can only work certain hours around school or during certain hours of the day and are limited in work, got her support.
“If you’re not allowed by the federal government to do the full job, you should not get the full wage,” Kauth said.
Kauth said bumping up and aligning the training wage for 16-, 17-, 18- and 19-year-old workers with the state minimum wage, rather than the federal minimum wage, was also a “significant” and positive improvement.
Raybould said the new wage could incentivize businesses to hire young workers. Conrad countered that customers don’t care how old an employee is who puts a can on a shelf or the pepperoni on a pizza.
‘A better resolution’
Clouse, a key swing vote on the issue who regularly met with Raybould and Conrad during debate, and had on his desk a stack of research papers, including the ballot initiative wording, read to reporters the language that voters approved for annual increases in the “cost of living” for the minimum wage.
  State Sen. Stan Clouse of Kearney reads the voter initiative packet from 2022 that led to increases to the state’s minimum wage. March 31, 2025. (Zach Wendling/Nebraska Examiner)
He said minimum wage can be a “job killer” for some workers who, as a “matter of economics,” might benefit while others might lose their jobs. He said a set annual increase could provide certainty but didn’t have any number in mind other than to say “it’s more than one and a half, I know that.”
“I think it’s right for those who voted for it, and I think it’s right for the business owners,” Clouse said. “It’s certainty, and I like certainty, and I like minimizing the risk.”
Clouse said he feels there is always a way to find compromise and reach a good decision. But he said calling people names or pointing fingers isn’t the way to do so. 
“Hopefully we get it worked out because this is no fun, everybody’s sitting through this stuff all day. It’s a waste of our time, but yet everybody’s wanting to do what’s right for their constituents, and I get that,” Clouse said. “That’s part of the process I’m not used to because that’s not how we do business in Kearney.”
‘The will of the people’
Clouse said he will not vote for “cloture” to end debate or to advance LB 258 unless the bill is amended first. The bill would face up to four hours of debate during the second of three rounds of debate.

Raybould filed an amendment Tuesday that would let the minimum wage increase faster than her most recent proposal’s 1.5% cap, a key point of contention for Clouse. But it would still include a flexible increase of between 0% and 2.5% each year, based on inflation. 
Raybould and others reminded colleagues that the Nebraska Constitution allows the Legislature to modify laws passed using ballot measures. 
Others, like State Sen. John Cavanaugh of Omaha, said that “just because you have power doesn’t mean you should exercise it,” saying Raybould sought to undermine voters.
“We’re not using it to undermine the will of the people,” Raybould said. “We’re doing it to review and reflect and make sure we make a clear balance and have a clear understanding of the unintended consequences and impacts it can have on businesses, on daycare centers, on paying for referees for our youth sports. All of these costs will be passed on.”



Raise the Wage Nebraska donations 
State Sen. Mike Moser of Columbus on Tuesday criticized the Raise the Wage Nebraska campaign for getting the vast majority of its funds in 2021 and 2022 from out-of-state donors, most from groups in Washington D.C., that don’t disclose individual donors.
State Sen. Ben Hansen of Blair echoed Moser and said curbing out-of-state donations should be a bipartisan effort.
According to the Nebraska Accountability and Disclosure Commission data through January 2023, roughly 79% of funds for the campaign came from Washington D.C., while 19% came in-state from Lincoln, Omaha or Lyons. The Lyons-based Center for Rural Affairs gave $20,000.
The largest in-state donor was Nebraska Appleseed, at $560,474.21.
D.C.-based Sixteen Thirty Fund gave the campaign $2.49 million throughout 2022. The fund is managed by Arabella Advisors, which was founded by a former administration appointee of former President Bill Clinton. It oversees a hub of other left-leaning nonprofits that have received donations from billionaire George Soros in the past. It doesn’t disclose its donors.
Raise the Wage Nebraska also received $183,189.63 from The Fairness Project, a progressive labor-focused group that also helped the Nebraska campaigns to expand Medicaid (2018), curb predatory payday lending (2020) and secure a minimum level of paid sick leave (2024).
Rounding out the campaign’s top donors was the Service Employees International Union, which was established in 1921 and is based in Washington, D.C. The union has about 2 million members.
The campaign gave Nebraskans for Paid Sick Leave in August 2023 a donation of $15,454.87. The Legislature last week voted 34-14 to advance a bill to add new carveouts to the paid sick leave before it takes effect Oct. 1. The first voter-approved minimum wage increase from the 2022 effort took effect Jan. 1, 2023.
State Sen. Terrell McKinney of North Omaha was and continues to be the campaign’s treasurer.

Ward was convicted of capital murder in 1990 and sentenced to death in the 1989 strangulation killing of 18-year-old convenience store clerk Rebecca Doss.
Ward was among eight inmates who were scheduled to be executed in 2017 as the state worked to impose the death penalty before drugs used in the lethal injection process expired. The state Supreme Court granted a stay for Ward after his attorneys argued his longstanding mental illness prevented him from understanding his punishment.
Ultimately, the state executed four of the eight.
Twenty-four inmates remain on death row in Arkansas.

Photo by Baylor Spears/Wisconsin Examiner Incumbent Jill Underly, who had the backing of the Democratic Party of Wisconsin, won a second term as state superintendent on Tuesday, defeating education consultant and Republican-backed candidate Brittany Kinser. 
The Associated Press called the race at 10:05 p.m. with Underly leading by more than 5 points and more than 80% of the votes counted.  
The state superintendent, a technically nonpartisan position, is responsible for providing guidance for the state’s 421 public school districts, leading the Department of Public Instruction (DPI)  — an agency responsible for administering state and federal funds, licensing teachers and developing educational curriculum and state assessments — and also holds a position on the University of Wisconsin Board of Regents. 
Throughout the campaign, Underly faced criticism from her opponent, Republicans and others for her recent approval of changes to state testing standards and poor communication with school districts. 
Underly defended her decisions throughout the campaign, however, and said that she has served as “the No. 1 advocate for public education” in her first term and would continue to do so if reelected. Prior to being elected to the top DPI position, Underly worked as assistant director in DPI. She also previously served as a principal and superintendent of the Pecatonica Area School District and taught in public schools in Indiana.
Underly received endorsement from Wisconsin Education Association Council, the state’s largest teachers’ union, and AFT-Wisconsin. The Democratic Party of Wisconsin contributed over $850,000 to her campaign. While Underly had the backing of the state Democratic party, Democrat Gov. Tony Evers refused to endorse in the race. 
Underly leaned on her advocacy for public schools while making the argument for her reelection. She introduced a budget request for the state that would have invested over $4 billion in public education, saying that it’s what schools deserved. Republicans and Evers both said it was too large. 
At Underly’s Election Night party, Sen. Dianne Hesselbein (D-Middleton) said Underly’s victory was a vindication of her first term in office.
“She’s had to make do with some really tough choices, and she’s done a great job for kids and for teachers,” Hesselbein said.
Underly hit her opponent for her lobbying and support for Wisconsin’s school choice programs, for lacking a teacher’s license and for lacking experience in the state’s public school system. She also expressed her opposition to the growth of the state’s school choice programs. She said it is not sustainable for the state to fund two school systems and would oppose dedicating more money to the programs.

The amendment was approved by 25 points. The Associated Press called the election less than 40 minutes after the polls closed. 
The Republican-authored referendum does not change the law that was already on the books in the state which requires that voters show an approved ID to register to vote and receive a ballot. Republican legislators said the amendment was necessary to protect the statute from being overturned by the state Supreme Court. In recent years, Republicans in the Legislature have increasingly turned to the constitutional amendment process to shape state law without needing the signature of Democratic Gov. Tony Evers. 
Democrats had accused Republicans of including the referendum on the ballot in this election as an effort to boost conservative turnout in the state Supreme Court election. 
Wisconsin’s voter ID law has been on the books for more than a decade. During debate over the law, Republican lawmakers discussed its potential to help the party win elections by suppressing the vote of minority and college-aged people who tend to vote for Democrats. 
Democrats and voting rights groups said the law amounted to a “poll tax.” A 2017 study found that the law kept 17,000 people from the polls in the 2016 election. 
Since its passage, a number of court decisions have adjusted the law, leading the state to ease restrictions and costs for obtaining a photo ID — particularly for people who can’t afford a high cost or don’t have proper documents such as a birth certificate. 
Republicans in Wisconsin and across the country have increasingly focused on photo ID requirements for voting since conspiracy theories about election administration emerged following President Donald Trump’s false claims that he was robbed of victory because of voter fraud in the 2020 presidential campaign.
While the law doesn’t change, the approved language of the amendment gives the Legislature the authority to determine what types of ID qualify as valid for voting purposes. Currently, approved IDs include Wisconsin driver’s licenses and state IDs, U.S. passports, military IDs and certain student IDs.

(Baylor Spears | Wisconsin Examiner)Dane County Judge Susan Crawford was elected to the Wisconsin Supreme Court Tuesday, solidifying liberal control of the body until 2028 and marking a sharp rebuke by the state’s voters of the policies of President Donald Trump and the financial might of his most prominent adviser, Elon Musk. 
Crawford rode massive turnout in Dane and Milwaukee counties and outperformed Kamala Harris’ effort last year in a number of other parts of the state to defeat her opponent, Waukesha County Judge Brad Schimel by about 11 points. 
The former chief legal counsel for Democratic Gov. Jim Doyle who represented liberal groups such as Planned Parenthood and the Madison teacher’s union as a private practice attorney said during the campaign that she would look out for the rights of all Wisconsinites on the Supreme Court while repeatedly criticizing Schimel for his eagerness to show his support for Trump, his record as attorney general and the outside assistance his campaign got from Musk. 
Crawford’s victory marks the third straight Supreme Court election for Wisconsin’s liberals and maintains the 4-3 liberal majority that has been in place since Justice Janet Protasiewicz was elected in 2023. Crawford will replace retiring Justice Ann Walsh Bradley. 
Since gaining control of the Court, the new liberal majority has ruled that the state’s previous legislative maps were unconstitutional, ending the partisan gerrymander that had locked in Republican control of the Legislature for more than a decade, and accepted cases that will decide the rights of Wisconsinites to have an abortion and join labor unions. 
Schimel said he got into the race because he was opposed to the “partisanship” of the liberal controlled Court but his effort to nationalize the race and show his support for Trump proved unsuccessful against a backlash to the second Trump term and voters’ distrust of Musk, who offered cash incentives for people who got out the vote for Schimel. 
Tuesday’s election was the first statewide race in the country since Trump won the presidency last fall. Trump narrowly won Wisconsin and in counties across the state, Schimel failed to match the president’s vote total in counties across the state. In La Crosse County, Crawford performed 11 points better than Harris did last year and Schimel didn’t even match Trump’s vote share in his home of Waukesha County. 
Schimel ran nearly even with former Supreme Court Justice Dan Kelly, who lost to Protasiewicz in the 2023 race. Wisconsin’s conservatives have now lost the past three Supreme Court elections by double digits.
The 2025 Wisconsin Supreme Court race set the record for the most expensive judicial campaign in U.S. history, topping the $100 million mark. While Crawford received support from liberal billionaires including George Soros and Illinois Gov. J.B. Pritzker, Musk dwarfed all other contributors, dumping more than $20 million into the race.

Musk’s money helped blanket the state’s airwaves with attack ads against Crawford’s record as a judge, often criticizing sentences she gave to people convicted of sexual violence. A Musk-associated PAC also hired people to knock on thousands of doors in an effort to turn out Trump’s base of Wisconsin voters, who have often sat out non-presidential elections. America PAC, a political action committee associated with Musk, paid door knockers $25 an hour, offered voters cash if they filled out a petition against “activist judges” and gave two people $1 million checks at a rally on Sunday. 
In a concession speech delivered shortly before 9:30 p.m., Schimel told supporters they “didn’t leave anything on the field,” and when a few began to complain said “no, we’ve gotta accept this.”
“The numbers aren’t going to turn around. Too bad. We’re not going to pull this off,” he said. “So thank you guys. From the bottom of my heart. God bless you. God bless the state of Wisconsin. God bless America. You will rise again. We’ll get up to fight another day, it just wasn’t our day.”
The Democratic Party of Wisconsin, harnessing voters’ alarm at the actions Musk has been leading from his federal DOGE office to cut government programs and fire thousands of public employees, held People v. Musk town halls across the state where residents said they were worried about the effect those cuts would have on services they rely on like Medicaid, Social Security, veteran’s benefits and education funding. 
Democrats and Crawford accused Musk of trying to buy a seat on the state Supreme Court, partially to influence a lawsuit his company, Tesla, has filed challenging a Wisconsin law that prohibits car manufacturers from selling directly to consumers. Musk said he was focused on the race because the Court could decide the constitutionality of the state’s congressional maps, which currently favor Republicans and help the party hold a narrow majority in the U.S. House of Representatives. 
On the campaign trail, Crawford sought to tie Schimel to Musk — she called her opponent “Elon Schimel” at the only debate between the two candidates — while portraying herself as the less partisan candidate. Throughout the nominally non-partisan race, both candidates lobbed accusations of extreme political views at the other. 
With Crawford’s victory and the retention of the Court’s liberal majority, the body is expected to rule on cases that ask if Wisconsin’s Constitution grants women the right to access an abortion, the legality of the Republican-authored law that restricts the collective bargaining rights of most public employees, how Wisconsin’s industries should be regulated for pollution and the legality of the state’s congressional maps. 
Heather Williams, a spokesperson for the Democratic Legislative Campaign Committee, said in a statement that Democrats were offering a better vision for the country than the one promised by Schimel, Trump and Musk. 
“Despite Republicans’ best efforts to buy this seat, Wisconsin voters showed up for their values and future,” Williams said. “While Trump dismantles programs that taxpayers have earned, support, and are counting on, voters across the country are turning to state Democrats who are delivering on promises to lower costs and expand opportunities.”",https://wisconsinexaminer.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/1000002135-1024x576.jpg,,,2025-04-01 23:01:58.657626

(Joshua Haiar/South Dakota Searchlight)PIERRE — As a trial opened Tuesday for a woman accused of stealing $1.8 million intended for children under South Dakota’s care, the defense alleged that the state shares the blame for crimes that are too old to punish, while the prosecution described a long-running and calculated scheme.
Lonna Carroll, a 68-year-old retiree, is charged with two felony counts of grand theft for crimes she allegedly committed from 2010 to 2023 while working as an administrative assistant for the Division of Child Protection Services in the state Department of Social Services. She faces up to 25 years in prison and a $50,000 fine for the first count, and 15 years in prison and a $30,000 fine for the second count.
The case is part of a rash of criminal allegations against state employees that state Attorney General Marty Jackley has filed since last year, leading not only to criminal prosecutions but also to a series of administrative and legislative reforms adopted in response.
Carroll has been held at the Hughes County Jail since her arrest last summer, because she has not posted bail of $50,000. Her trial is expected to last several days this week at the Hughes County Courthouse.
The alleged crimes
Once a child is placed in state custody, Child Protection Services employees can make financial requests on the child’s behalf for items such as school supplies, clothing or a bed. The funds are deposited into a bank account for the child. 
Jackley alleged during opening statements that Carroll made requests, approved the requests, deposited checks at American Bank and Trust in Pierre into children’s accounts, and later withdrew the deposited amounts in cash. 
Carroll allegedly did that 215 times, stealing a total of $1,777,665.73 over the course of 13 years. 
“It wasn’t by mistake,” Jackley said. 
Investigators allegedly discovered a storage unit in Pierre associated with Carroll that had “boxes full of receipts” for expensive clothing.
Carroll was making $21.09 an hour when she retired in March 2023 prior to the discovery of her alleged crimes, and she had since moved to Algona, Iowa. The South Dakota Department of Social Services has an annual budget of $1.8 billion and more than 1,500 full-time positions.
The case begins
Carroll spent much of the first day of trial hunched over with her arms crossed, staring at the floor. The day was consumed mostly by jury selection and opening statements.
Questions to potential jurors from Carroll’s court-appointed attorney, Timothy Whalen, largely centered on concerns about preconceived notions of the case. He also asked potential jurors what a statute of limitations means and whether they accept the notion.
Former state employee pleads not guilty in $1.8 million theft case

Whalen’s opening statement included a claim that the crimes are too old to prosecute, though he did not delve into specifics.  
“They’re time-barred,” Whalen said. 
Whalen also said the state needs to take responsibility for its own negligence. He said prosecutors should be required to demonstrate the state was conducting some level of due diligence to prevent the theft from occurring.
“Who was watching the door?” Whalen asked jurors. 
Jackley asked potential jurors if they had negative ideas about the state or the criminal justice system. He also asked how they would feel if someone stole a car with the keys left in it. 
Jackley told jurors during his opening statement that they will hear audio of Carroll admitting she stole the money during a Division of Criminal Investigation interview. 
“You’ll see the whole paper trail process,” Jackley said. 
Testimony kicks off
Jackley kicked off the state’s case with testimony from Carrie Watts, the state employee who discovered the financial discrepancies that ultimately led to the investigation and criminal charges. 
A court document says Watts discovered the irregularities in 2023 while comparing spreadsheet balances with actual account balances.
“One of the discrepancies was that certain accounts showed significant sums of funds in them on a spreadsheet, but the funds were not actually in the account,” the court document says. 
Watts, who left the department last year, described her actions as routine. 
“It’s like balancing a checkbook,” Watts said during her testimony. 
She said Carroll managed the bank accounts in question.
“They all had Lonna’s name on them,” Watts said. 
The defense attempted to use Watts’ testimony as evidence of the state’s negligence, asking why a simple audit took so long to be conducted.

Later, Tonia Bogue, who worked with Carroll, took the stand. She said Child Protection Services has three tiers of approval for payment requests, and Carroll was authorized for all three levels. 
Bogue said she had “no idea” how Carroll attained that level of authority.
When asked by Whalen who is tasked with ensuring someone requesting a payment is not the same person approving the payment, Bogue said “I don’t know.” 
Two employees with American Bank and Trust also took the stand. The prosecution presented an exhibit showing a nearly $20,000 check was deposited by Carroll into a child’s account on Oct. 6, 2020, and withdrawn by her as cash the next day.
Carroll allegedly kept individual withdrawals under $10,000 to avoid being flagged for fraud. 
Aimee Parsons, a bank employee, said she was familiar with Carroll depositing and cashing the checks, but she never reported the behavior. 
“Because she was authorized to conduct those transactions,” Parsons said.



Other cases of alleged state employee crimes
The Carroll case is one of five that Jackley has filed since last year accusing state employees of crimes.
The run of allegations started in August, when Jackley said a deceased former three-decade employee of the state Department of Revenue, Sandra O’Day, had allegedly created 13 fake vehicles to help her secure $400,000 in loans. No charges were filed, because O’Day died before her alleged behavior came to light. 
In October, Jackley announced charges against two more former Department of Revenue employees, Lynne Hunsley, 64, and Danielle Degenstein, 51, both of Pierre.
Hunsley has since pleaded guilty to forgery and grand theft by deception for creating a fake vehicle title that she used as proof of a trade-in to help her avoid excise taxes. She was sentenced to three years of probation and ordered to pay a $1,000 fine and $1,200 in restitution to the state.
Degenstein is charged with a misdemeanor for allegedly concealing her knowledge of a crime committed by a person identified in court documents as “S.O.” — initials that match O’Day’s. Degenstein’s case is scheduled for trial in June.
In December, Renee Strong, 55, of Springfield, was charged with felonies for allegedly submitting falsified reports of food-serve health inspections while working for the state Department of Public Safety. She’s scheduled for a motions hearing next week.
In January, Amalia Escalante Barrientos, 28, of Brookings, pleaded guilty to a misdemeanor for using a grocery voucher intended for clients of the Department of Social Services. She was sentenced to pay a $400 fine, $96.50 in court costs and $449.98 in restitution. She’ll avoid serving 180 days in jail if she complies with the sentence.
In response to the run of alleged crimes, Jackley supported a package of four bills passed during the recent legislative session that will expand the investigatory authority of the state auditor, strengthen the Board of Internal Controls, institute mandatory reporting requirements for state employees and penalties for failing to report, and establish protections for whistleblowers.
Lawmakers also passed legislation strengthening the ability of the Legislature’s Government Operations and Audit Committee to conduct investigations and issue orders known as subpoenas requiring people to testify or supply information.

Cory Booker started his speech on Monday at 7 p.m. and said he would continue as long as he is “physically able.” Photo by John Partipilo. U.S. Sen. Cory Booker broke the record for longest floor speech in the history of the Senate on Tuesday, surpassing the 24-hour and 18-minute record set in 1957 when South Carolina’s Strom Thurmond attempted to prevent passage of the Civil Rights Act.
Booker, a Democrat who began his remarks Monday at 7 p.m. saying he wanted to highlight President Donald Trump’s “complete disregard for the rule of law,” by Tuesday at 7:20 p.m. was raspy-voiced, occasionally teary-eyed, and wearing what he called a “ripe” shirt.
It was New York Sen. Chuck Schumer, the Senate’s Democratic leader, who interrupted Booker to say he had broken Thurmond’s record.
“Do you know how proud this caucus is of you? Do you know how proud America is of you?” Schumer said to applause and a standing ovation from his fellow Democrats and visitors.
Booker noted that Thurmond with his 1957 filibuster “tried to stop the rights upon which I stand.”
“I’m not here, though, because of his speech. I’m here despite his speech. I’m here because, as powerful as he was, the people were more powerful,” Booker said.
Wyoming Sen. Cynthia Lummis was one of just two Republican lawmakers in the chamber at the time. Lummis joined Democrats in celebrating Booker’s accomplishment by standing and clapping.
Guests and staff are normally barred from any displays of support or disapproval while sitting in the gallery, but Utah Sen. John Curtis, a Republican who was presiding over the chamber, allowed it.
Booker finally yielded the floor a few minutes after 8 p.m. Tuesday.
Booker’s record-breaking speech comes as the Democratic Party faces criticism from voters who say the party’s leaders are not doing enough to stand up to Trump’s actions, especially those that experts say fly in the face of legal precedent.
“These are not normal times in our nation, and they should not be treated as such in the United States Senate,” said Booker, 55. “The threats to the American people and American democracy are grave and urgent, and we all must do more to stand against them.”
Booker, a Democrat first elected to the Senate in 2013, on Monday said he’d continue speaking as long as he is “physically able.” After his speech surpassed 20 hours, he looked exhausted, joked about his shirt being “ripe,” and took occasional breaks by yielding the floor for questions from his Democratic colleagues, who praised the former college football player for his endurance.
His speech comes as the Democratic Party faces criticism from voters who say the party’s leaders are not doing enough to stand up to Trump’s actions, especially those that experts say fly in the face of legal precedent.
“This is not right or left. It is right or wrong. This is not a partisan moment. It is a moral moment,” Booker said early Tuesday afternoon. “Where do you stand?”
Booker’s speech is one of the longest ever given on the Senate floor. The record was previously held by Strom Thurmond, a South Carolina Republican who held the floor for 24 hours and 18 minutes in 1957 in protest of the Civil Rights Act.
The senator covered a breadth of topics: health care, Social Security, Medicaid, grocery prices, free speech, veterans, public education, world leaders, Elon Musk’s Department of Government Efficiency, and national security concerns. He read letters and comments from constituents and he quoted speeches from the late Rep. John Lewis — invoking Lewis’ famous call to action to “get in good trouble” — and the late Sen. John McCain.
Booker, a former mayor of Newark, also assailed Trump’s policies on immigration. He said the Trump administration is doing “outrageous things like disappearing people off of American streets, violating fundamental principles of this document” — here he held up a copy of the U.S. Constitution — “invoking the Alien Enemies Act from the 1700s that was last used to put Japanese Americans into internment camps.”
“Do we see what’s happening?” Booker asked.
He spent about a half-hour reading the account of Jasmine Mooney, a Canadian citizen who was detained by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement for 12 days in March. He also noted that the Trump administration conceded Monday that it deported Kilmar Abrego Garcia, a 29-year-old Maryland man with protected legal status, to an El Salvador prison because of an “administrative error.”
“The government can’t walk up to a human being and grab them off the street and put them on a plane and send them to one of the most notorious prisons in the world, and just say, as one of our authorities did, ‘Oopsie,’” Booker said.
Sen. Chuck Schumer (D-New York), who asked about the impact of potential Medicaid cuts and tariffs about 15 hours into Booker’s speech, told Booker he has the support of the entire party.
“Your strength, your fortitude, your clarity has just been nothing short of amazing. All of America is paying attention to what you’re saying. All of America needs to know there’s so many problems — the disastrous actions of this administration in terms of how they’re helping only the billionaires and hurting average families — you have brought this forth with such clarity,” he said.

(Courtesy of The Playing Field)Head Start child care providers in Wisconsin and five other Midwestern states were stunned Tuesday to learn that the federal agency’s Chicago regional office was closed and their administrators were placed on leave — throwing new uncertainty into the operation of the 60-year-old child care and early education program.
“The Regional Office is a critical link to maintaining program services and safety for children and families,” said Jenny Mauer, executive director of the Wisconsin Head Start Association, in a statement distributed to news organizations Tuesday afternoon.
The surprise shutdown of the federal agency’s Chicago office — and four others across the country — left Head Start program directors uncertain about where to turn, Mauer said.
“We have received calls throughout the day from panicked Head Start programs worried about impacts to approving their current grants, fiscal issues, and applications to make their programs more responsive to their local communities,” Mauer said.
The regional offices are part of the Office of Head Start in the Administration for Children and Families at the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS). 
In an interview, Mauer said there had been no official word to Head Start providers about the Chicago office closing. Some program leaders learned of the closing from private contacts with people in the office. 
“We have not seen official information come out” to local Head Start directors, who operate on the federal grants that fund the program, Mayer said. “It’s just really alarming. For an agency that is about serving families, I don’t understand how this can be.”
The National Head Start Association issued a press release Tuesday expressing “deep concern” about the regional office closings. 
“In order to avoid disrupting services for children and families, we urge the administration to reconsider these actions until a plan has been created and shared widely,” the association stated.
Katie Hamm, the deputy assistant secretary for early childhood development at HHS during the Biden administration, posted on LinkedIn shortly before 12 noon Tuesday that she had learned of reduction-in-force (RIF) notices to employees in the Administration for Children and Families earlier in the day. 
RIF notices appear to have gone to all employees of the Office of Head Start and the Office of Child Care in five regional offices, Hamm wrote, in Boston, New York, San Francisco and Seattle in addition to Chicago. 
“Staff are on paid leave effective immediately and no longer have access to their files,” Hamm wrote. “There does not appear to be a transition plan so that Head Start grantees, States, and Tribes are assigned to a new office. For Head Start, it is unclear who will administer grants going forward.”
Hamm left HHS at the end of the Biden administration in January, according to her LinkedIn profile. 
Mauer said regional office employees “are our key partners and colleagues,” and their departure has left Head Start operators “incredibly saddened and deeply concerned.” 
Regional employees work with providers “to ensure the safety and quality of services and to meet the mission of providing care for the most vulnerable families in the country,” Mauer said. 
The regional offices provide grant oversight, distribute funds, monitor Head Start programs and advise centers on complying with regulations, including for child safety, she said. They also provide training and technical assistance for local Head Start programs.
“The Regional Office is a critical link to maintaining program services and safety for children and families,” Mauer said. “These cuts will have a direct impact on programs, children, and families.”
In addition to Wisconsin, the Chicago regional office oversees programs in Ohio, Indiana, Illinois, Michigan and Minnesota. 
Head Start supervises about 284 grants across the six states in programs that  enroll about 115,000 children, according to Mauer. There are 39 Head Start providers in Wisconsin enrolling about 16,000 children and employing about 4,000 staff.
The federal government created Head Start in the mid-1960s to provide early education for children living in low-income households. Head Start operators report that the vast majority of the families they serve rely on the program to provide child care so they can hold jobs.
The regional office closings came two months after a sudden halt in Head Start funding. Head Start operators get a federal reimbursement after they incur expenses, and program directors have been accustomed to being able to submit their expenses and receive reimbursement payments through an online portal.
Over about two weeks in late January and early February, program leaders in Wisconsin and across the country reported that they were unable to log into the system or post their payment requests. The glitches persisted for some programs for several days, but were ultimately resolved by Feb. 10.
Mauer told the Wisconsin Examiner on Tuesday that so far, there have not been new payment delays. But there has also been no communication with Head Start operators about what happens now with the unexpected regional office closings, she said.
“No plan for who will provide support has been shared, and the still-existing regional offices are already understaffed,” Mauer said. “I’m very nervous to see what happens. With no transition plan this will be a disaster.”
In her statement, Mauer said the regional office closing was “another example of the Federal Administration’s continuing assault on Head Start” following the earlier funding freeze and stalled reimbursements.
She said closing regional offices was undermining the program’s ability to function.
“We call on Congress to immediately investigate this blatant effort to hamper Head Start’s ability to provide services,” Mauer stated, “and to hold the Administration accountable for their actions.”

Bob Ferguson on Tuesday put the kibosh on Democratic lawmakers&#8217; plans to use billions of dollars from a proposed wealth tax to balance the state budget. Ferguson, a first-term Democrat, also said he could not sign budgets passed in the two chambers in recent days because they each rely too much on taxes.  [&#8230;]","Gov Bob Ferguson in a media availability on Tuesday, April 1, 2025. (Photo by Jacquelyn Jimenez Romero/Washington State Standard)Washington Gov. Bob Ferguson on Tuesday put the kibosh on Democratic lawmakers’ plans to use billions of dollars from a proposed wealth tax to balance the state budget.
Ferguson, a first-term Democrat, also said he could not sign budgets passed in the two chambers in recent days because they each rely too much on taxes. 
“We cannot adopt an all-cuts budget,” he said. “We cannot adopt a budget with anywhere near the level of taxes in the House and Senate plans.”
He called on lawmakers to “immediately move budget discussions in a different direction.”
Ferguson remained skeptical about the proposal to tax financial investments held by wealthy individuals, saying it would be “difficult to implement, and most importantly, for purposes of adopting a sustainable budget, will face an immediate challenge in court.”
He said at a news conference he would not sign any spending plan dependent on substantial revenues from a new and untested tax that faced the “real possibility of being overturned.”
But he left the door slightly ajar for House and Senate Democrats to pencil in the wealth tax if they count on no more than $100 million a year to see if it can withstand a legal challenge and be upheld “in the court of public opinion.”
“I am open to a conversation,” he said. “I want to be very clear that I’ve not committed to that.”
The governor on Tuesday also reiterated his view that it will take a mix of spending cuts and new revenue to overcome a projected shortfall of $16 billion over the next four fiscal years.
Majority Democrats in the House and Senate have made the wealth tax a cornerstone of their respective revenue packages to balance the next state budget.
It is counted on for $2.4 billion in the two-year House budget approved Tuesday and $ $4.2 billion in the one passed by the Senate on Saturday. The sums are different because they are not identical approaches.
The architect of the wealth tax in the Senate said the governor’s comments show there is “common ground” on which to negotiate in the final month of the session.
Sen. Noel Frame, D-Seattle, a vice chair of the Senate Ways and Means Committee, said she was “very glad” Ferguson acknowledged Washington needs to reform its “upside-down tax code” that hits those with lower incomes hardest. And she said she revised language in her bill to address specific concerns he raised.
“This whole thing is very dynamic. I think he opened the door for ongoing conversations and set the bar for progressive revenue,” she said. “We’ve got three-and-a-half more weeks to get it done.”
Mechanics of the tax
The House wealth tax proposal would levy a tax of $8 on every $1,000 of assessed value of certain financial assets, such as stocks, bonds, exchange-traded funds, and mutual funds. The tax would only apply to the value of these assets that is above $50 million. 
There would be exemptions for pensions, retirement accounts, and education savings accounts. About 4,300 people would pay the tax, generating about $2 billion per year, beginning in fiscal year 2027, according to the state Department of Revenue.
Those dollars would be dedicated to the Education Legacy Trust Account, where they could be used for public schools and early learning programs.
Senate Democrats want to set the tax rate at $10. They contend the same number of people would pay, but the amount generated would be $4 billion a year. That’s because they tax the full value of the targeted assets if a person has more than $50 million of them.
In other words, if you have $51 million of these assets, Senate Democrats would apply the new tax on all of it, while the House would only tax the $1 million.
‘The wrong move’
Senate Minority Leader John Braun, R-Centralia, said he appreciated Ferguson’s “candor” and “thoughtfulness” concerning taxes and spending.
“I think his priorities are spot on,” he said. “I think his priorities line up much closer to the budget Republicans proposed.”
Opponents of the wealth tax applauded the governor’s comments. They have argued such a tax would cause wealthy individuals to flee Washington and that it would hurt investment in businesses in the state. They also contend it would tax out-of-state wealth in violation of the U.S. Constitution.
“A wealth tax is the wrong move for Washington — both legally and economically — and Ferguson’s remarks are a clear sign that Olympia is finally beginning to hear the concerns of families, small businesses, and job creators across the state,” reads a statement issued jointly by the Association of Washington Business, Bellevue Chamber of Commerce, Seattle Metropolitan Chamber of Commerce, and Washington Roundtable.
In an interview, Steve Mullin, president of the Washington Roundtable, said the Legislature “should not assume any revenues from a wealth tax for the foreseeable future.” 
If such a new levy is enacted, the organization would “do what we can” to facilitate challenges in state and federal courts, Mullin said.
Ferguson mum on other taxes
Washington’s next budget cycle begins July 1 and runs through June 30, 2027.
The much-discussed multibillion-dollar shortfall represents the amount needed to maintain current levels of service, pay for new and expanded programs authorized in previous budgets and cover the cost of new collective bargaining agreements with employee unions.
In addition to a wealth tax, the revenue package crafted by Senate Democrats would increase the cap on annual growth in property tax collections, impose a new tax on the payrolls of large companies and axe several tax breaks. Altogether it could gross $21 billion over four years.
House Democrats are focused on the wealth tax plus measures to remove the 1% cap on annual growth in property tax collections. They also want to add a surcharge on large corporations and financial institutions. Their package would generate roughly $15 billion.
On Tuesday, Ferguson said he has a topline number in mind for how much he’d tolerate raising from new taxes, but he declined to share it. He also didn’t say much about the other Democrat-backed tax ideas, which Republicans have blasted since the start of session.
“This is enormous, shocking, surreal, stunning — whatever word you want to pick — amount of taxes proposed,” Braun said. 
Ferguson’s silence, he said, does mean any or all of those taxes could be pursued. But he didn’t fault the governor as he thinks he is “doing the right thing he needs to do to be successful” in negotiations with budget writers.",https://washingtonstatestandard.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/IMG_0785-1024x683.jpeg,,,2025-04-01 22:02:04.406924

(Photo by James Brooks/Alaska Beacon)Visitors to the state Capitol in Juneau will have to go through a metal detector under a policy adopted on Monday. 
The Capitol visitor screening policy was approved in a 9-4 vote by the Legislative Council, a body made up of members from both the House and Senate that sets the rules for the Capitol complex. 
Lawmakers did not publicly discuss or debate the policy change. Before the vote, they met in a session closed to the public for more than an hour and a half for a security briefing and to discuss the policy proposal.
The council declined to require that people in the building have ID badges, which was part of the original proposal. 
Senate President Gary Stevens, R-Kodiak and the council’s vice chair, supported the change. He described his reasoning in a Senate majority caucus news conference on Tuesday. 
“The idea, really, is … to make sure people aren’t entering with weapons — with guns, with knives and that sort of thing,” he said. “You know, some folks have said, ‘Well, let’s wait until there’s an incident, where someone gets hurt, and then we will install it.’ I think that’s not wise at all.”
Stevens cited a comment by Sen. Lyman Hoffman, D-Bethel, that hundreds of people undergo screenings at the annual Alaska Federation of Natives convention with little wait time. 
Stevens also noted that metal detectors are used in the Dimond Courthouse across the street from the Capitol. 
“You have them [at] every airport you enter into, so it’s not as if people are unaware of how they work,” he said. 
People who already have an electronic keycard to enter the building will not be affected by the policy. Stevens said the security staff who will operate the metal detectors say 20 seconds is the most time it would take to move through the devices.
Stevens said several times recently, people who work in the Capitol have told him they had concern or fear regarding visitors who don’t have a reason to be in the building.
Rep. Sara Hannan, D-Juneau and the council chair, also voted for the change. She wrote in a newsletter to constituents on Tuesday that no legislators were happy to make the change, but waiting for a tragedy to occur was unacceptable.
“Legislative Council did not arrive at this decision lightly. For decades, we in Alaska have taken pride in the citizenry’s open access to the Legislature,” Hannon wrote. “However, and very unfortunately, in recent years our country has changed in ways that have led to increased risk of violence in our public institutions. The tragic, unchecked level of shootings in U.S. schools is in itself horrifying. The January 6th, 2020, attack on the nation’s Capitol is another dispiriting example.” 
Rep. Kevin McCabe, R-Big Lake, opposed the change. He is not currently on the council but served as its vice chair last year and said the idea has been under discussion for at least four years. He said Capitol security staff had brought up how only a few state capitols do not require screening. He said the staff’s job is to keep the building secure, and they were doing their job by bringing the screening idea to legislators.
McCabe said the discussions prompted him and other Matanuska-Susitna Borough legislators to ask constituents about the idea while they were campaigning. 
“They’re already very angry that the Capitol is still down here in Juneau, where they can’t come visit and they can’t really get to us, so they just saw closing the Capitol with magnetometers and badges … they saw that as just another step in isolating legislators from the public,” McCabe said. “And they believe, as do I frankly, that the Capitol building is the people’s building.”
McCabe predicted that the next step would be to require badges.
“I just feel we should leave it open. We have a really able security team and, frankly, Alaskans are just not that militant, that they would storm the Capitol or come into the Capitol and create an issue,” he said. 
The council members who voted for the policy change were chair Rep. Sara Hannan, D-Juneau; Stevens; House Speaker Bryce Edgmon, I-Dillingham; Sen. Matt Claman, D-Anchorage; Sen. Cathy Giessel, R-Anchorage; Sen. Elvi Gray-Jackson, D-Anchorage; Rep. Calvin Schrage, I-Anchorage; Sen. Bert Stedman, R-Sitka; and Rep. Louise Stutes, R-Kodiak.
Voting against requiring the screenings were Rep. Ashley Carrick, D-Fairbanks; Sen. Jesse Kiehl, D-Juneau; Rep. Chuck Kopp, R-Anchorage; and Rep. Mike Prax, R-North Pole.
The council also voted 8-5 to award a contract for up to $35,000 to University Protection Service LP to provide the screening services. The only difference in the council members’ votes was that of Stedman, who voted against the contract. He said he generally opposed adding the metal detectors, noting that visitors already have to make an effort to go to Juneau. But he said he decided to vote for the policy after the council made it less onerous by removing the ID badge requirement.

Cory Booker's 25-hour-plus speech broke a record previously held by a South Carolina senator who tried to prevent passage of the Civil Rights Act. (John Partipilo)U.S. Sen. Cory Booker broke the record for longest floor speech in the history of the Senate on Tuesday, surpassing the 24-hour and 18-minute record set in 1957 when South Carolina’s Strom Thurmond attempted to prevent passage of the Civil Rights Act.
Booker, a Democrat who began his remarks Monday at 7 p.m. saying he wanted to highlight President Donald Trump’s “complete disregard for the rule of law,” by Tuesday at 7:20 p.m. was raspy-voiced, occasionally teary-eyed, and wearing what he called a “ripe” shirt.
It was New York Sen. Chuck Schumer, the Senate’s Democratic leader, who interrupted Booker to say he had broken Thurmond’s record.
“Do you know how proud this caucus is of you? Do you know how proud America is of you?” Schumer said to applause and a standing ovation from his fellow Democrats and visitors.
Booker noted that Thurmond with his 1957 filibuster “tried to stop the rights upon which I stand.”
“I’m not here, though, because of his speech. I’m here despite his speech. I’m here because, as powerful as he was, the people were more powerful,” Booker said.
Wyoming Sen. Cynthia Lummis was one of just two Republican lawmakers in the chamber at the time. Lummis joined Democrats in celebrating Booker’s accomplishment by standing and clapping.
Guests and staff are normally barred from any displays of support or disapproval while sitting in the gallery, but Utah Sen. John Curtis, a Republican who was presiding over the chamber, allowed it.
Booker finally yielded the floor a few minutes after 8 p.m. Tuesday.
Booker’s record-breaking speech comes as the Democratic Party faces criticism from voters who say the party’s leaders are not doing enough to stand up to Trump’s actions, especially those that experts say fly in the face of legal precedent.
“These are not normal times in our nation, and they should not be treated as such in the United States Senate,” Booker said at one point. “The threats to the American people and American democracy are grave and urgent, and we all must do more to stand against them.”
The senator covered a breadth of topics: health care, Social Security, Medicaid, grocery prices, free speech, veterans, public education, world leaders, Elon Musk’s Department of Government Efficiency, and national security concerns. He read letters and comments from constituents and he quoted speeches from the late Rep. John Lewis — invoking Lewis’ famous call to action to “get in good trouble” — and the late Sen. John McCain.
“This is not right or left. It is right or wrong. This is not a partisan moment. It is a moral moment,” Booker said. “Where do you stand?”
Booker, 55, a former mayor of Newark, also assailed Trump’s policies on immigration. He said the Trump administration is doing “outrageous things like disappearing people off of American streets, violating fundamental principles of this document” — here he held up a copy of the U.S. Constitution — “invoking the Alien Enemies Act from the 1700s that was last used to put Japanese Americans into internment camps.”
“Do we see what’s happening?” Booker asked.
He spent about a half-hour reading the account of Jasmine Mooney, a Canadian citizen who was detained by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement for 12 days in March. He also noted that the Trump administration conceded Monday that it deported Kilmar Abrego Garcia, a 29-year-old Maryland man with protected legal status, to an El Salvador prison because of an “administrative error.”
“The government can’t walk up to a human being and grab them off the street and put them on a plane and send them to one of the most notorious prisons in the world, and just say, as one of our authorities did, ‘Oopsie,’” Booker said.

The overall budget grows by about 1.5% even though the general fund budget — the portion funded by direct state taxes — fell by more than $400 million. The bill now heads to a House-Senate conference committee. (Photo by Bryan P. Sears/Maryland Matters)The Senate Tuesday voted to approve the two-bill budget package that includes the overall spending plan and a second proposal that includes $1.6 billion in taxes.
The 33-14 vote on the overall $67 billion plan fell mostly along party lines. Sen. Mary-Dulany James (D-Harford) joined the 13 Senate Republicans in opposition.
The bill that includes some budget cuts and the tax package drew more votes from Democrats. The package of budget bills now heads to a conference committee with the House to work out differences before the last day of the legislative session Monday.
Senate Budget and Taxation Committee Chair Sen. Guy Guzzone (D-Howard) said the bills address projected structural deficits for fiscal 2026 and 2027 without requiring massive cuts to priorities, including education.
Despite the projections that included a $3 billion structural gap this year, Guzzone said he “was not worried about our situation in the grand sense because I always knew in my back pocket we had the ability to get rid of that structural deficit in seconds. But why would we? Why would we destroy that? We didn’t. We didn’t with this budget. We took tough stances.”
Not making the “heavy-handed” cuts he said some Republicans wanted was a sign that “we still have hope that we can accomplish those great goals that we established, because we decided that every child deserves a world-class education…. We balanced this budget this year, and we still kept sort of the hope of what would be the future.”
Even so, Republicans who had voted for eight budgets under Gov. Larry Hogan (R) and the first two proposed by Gov. Wes Moore (D) said they could not vote for the spending plan this year.
Sen. Johnny Mautz (R-Lower Shore) said “the Senate version is much better than the House version, and I think that has to be acknowledged. The willingness to take a different look at the budget from the Senate versus the House is a good thing. It’s a good thing. Unfortunately, it doesn’t go far enough.”
Republicans also voted against the companion bill that includes more than $1.6 billion in taxes, even though they were able to get Democrats to agree Monday to earmark a new $5 per tire fee for highway projects.
Five Democrats joined all 13 Republicans to vote no on the companion bill: James and Anne Arundel County Sens. Dawn Gile and Shaneka Henson, Sen. Katie Fry Hester (D-Montgomery and Howard) and Sen. Carl Jackson (D-Baltimore County).
Both bills, which were amended by the Senate, will head to a conference committee Wednesday with the House.

(Tess Vrbin/Arkansas Advocate)After more than two hours of debate, an Arkansas Senate committee advanced a proposal on Tuesday to abolish the Arkansas State Library and its board, which disburses state funding to local public libraries.
Senate Bill 536 would transfer the agency’s and board’s powers, authorities, funds, contracts and employees to the Arkansas Department of Education. The State Library is already under the department’s umbrella but operates independently.
The bill would delete all mentions of the State Library from existing state statute and make “prohibit[ing] access to age-inappropriate materials to a person who is sixteen (16) years old or younger” a condition for public libraries to receive state funds from the education department.
“My entire library, all 30,000 books, would fit inside this room,” Calhoun County Library Director Allie Gosselink said, speaking against SB 536 before the Senate Committee on State Agencies and Governmental Affairs in the Arkansas Capitol’s Old Supreme Court room.
“I need a definition for ‘access,’ or I can’t let anyone that’s under 16… inside my door,” Gosselink continued.
SB 536 defines “age-inappropriate material” as “books, media, or any other material accessible at a public library containing images or explicit and detailed descriptions” of sexual acts, sexual contact and human genitalia.
The location and availability of books based on “appropriateness” for minors was the thrust of Act 372 of 2023. The law would have given local elected officials the final say over whether to relocate challenged library materials some consider “obscene” and made librarians legally liable for disseminating such materials.
A federal judge temporarily and later permanently blocked portions of Act 372; Attorney General Tim Griffin appealed the ruling in January.

New bill would dissolve Arkansas State Library and its board, set new library funding criteria


Sen. Dan Sullivan, R-Jonesboro, sponsored Act 372 and is the primary sponsor of SB 536.
Protecting minors from “age-inappropriate material” in libraries and detaching from the American Library Association were the two requests Sullivan said he gave the State Library Board last month as conditions of its survival. The board voted against two proposals with those stated goals from Republican ex-senator Jason Rapert, who has called for the board’s abolition.
Sullivan subsequently doubled down on his existing promise to dissolve the board. He introduced a bill in February to abolish both the State Library Board and the Arkansas Educational Television Commission, which oversees Arkansas PBS, but he said he reached an agreement with the latter in March that led him to decide not to dissolve the commission.
On Tuesday, Sullivan told the State Agencies committee that his requests to the State Library Board should not have been difficult to fulfill and that SB 536 would ensure the state’s “oversight” of entities that receive public funds.
  Sen. Dan Sullivan, R-Jonesboro (John Sykes/Arkansas Advocate)
“When people say ‘Book Ban Dan’ is taking away their library or killing their library, they chose that path,” Sullivan said.
SB 536 would require libraries to submit annual reports to the Department of Education that include “an assurance of compliance with the applicable laws of the state, rules promulgated by the department, and the policies of the public library.”
For example, Sullivan said, libraries should not espouse diversity, equity and inclusion policies or allow transgender people to use bathrooms that do not match their gender assigned at birth. Sullivan has sponsored or supported laws to these ends this year and in 2023.
Four library directors, including Gosselink, and Arkansas State Library grants manager Debbie Hall spoke against SB 536. No members of the public spoke for the bill.
 ‘Semantics’

If the education department determines a library no longer qualifies for state funding, the library would be allowed to appeal the decision as long as it can prove “the determination was made in error” or “the determination was correct but remedial actions have been taken by the public library to bring the public library into compliance,” according to SB 536.
The appeal process would not be sufficient if the law goes into effect July 1 in accordance with its emergency clause, said Misty Hawkins, regional director of the Arkansas River Valley Regional Library System, which has seven branches in Franklin, Johnson, Logan and Yell counties. The library system would have to rewrite its interlocal agreements between the four counties to account for the new code and repealed code in SB 536, which is not possible to complete in only three months, Hawkins said.
“As a director, I am now doing more [to] ensure my libraries are in compliance in order to get the same amount of funding,” which is $188,000 from the state, Hawkins said.
She also said SB 536 does not specify how librarians must determine whether a book is appropriate for a 16-year-old but not for a 15-year-old. All five people who spoke against the bill said libraries already organize books on shelves in an age-appropriate manner in accordance with existing standards, and State Library Board members have made similar statements.

After rejecting the two proposals put forth by Sullivan and Rapert last month, the State Library Board passed a motion to create “non-binding policies to protect children” while honoring First Amendment freedoms and libraries’ material selection policies.
Sullivan said this was not enough to deter him from dissolving the board, partly because the majority of members still opposed removing references to the American Library Association from board documents.
On Tuesday, Sullivan repeated his criticism of a former ALA president for publicly calling herself a Marxist and the ALA’s Library Bill of Rights for stating that access to libraries should not be restricted based on a person’s age.
The ALA presidency is “a ceremonial job” that does not directly influence the policies of the nonprofit trade association that advocates for libraries and helps them secure grant funding, said John McGraw, executive director of the Faulkner-Van Buren Regional Library.
Sen. Alan Clark, R-Lonsdale, said the ALA’s Library Bill of Rights rubs him the wrong way because it asserts “you can’t protect a 3-year-old” from inappropriate content.
Gosselink called Clark’s statement “semantics.”
“Not a single person sitting behind me will tell you that you do not need to protect a 3-year-old from certain things that are in our libraries,” she said. “That is the parents’ job. We can’t make a whole library acceptable for a 3-year-old.”










Local libraries are already governed by their local boards that know their communities best. This bill takes that away, replacing it with centralized oversight that doesn’t understand the unique needs of each town and city.


– Clare Graham, Mid-Arkansas Regional Library System director


McGraw said, not for the first time, that his library system doesn’t have a mechanism to lock away books that might be appropriate for adults but inappropriate for small children.
A bill advanced later on Tuesday that would require Arkansas public school libraries serving K-5 students to segregate “non-age-appropriate sexual content” in “a locked compartment within a designated area.” House Bill 1646 passed the House with 75 votes for it and 14 against it, mostly along party lines, and will next go to the Senate Education Committee.
SB 536 includes a limited exception to the proposed restrictions on “age-inappropriate materials.” Sex education materials would be accessible to minors between 12 and 15 years old, and those under 12 would not be able to access such materials if their parents or guardians have forbidden their access in writing.
Six of the eight Senate State Agencies committee members, including Sullivan, voted to pass SB 536. Sen. Bryan King, R-Green Forest, voted against it. The committee’s sole Democrat, Sen. Clarke Tucker of Little Rock, was absent during the vote.
 Hours of operation and federal ‘chaos’

SB 536 would also require libraries to maintain a specific minimum hours of operation depending on the populations of the areas they serve. For example, a library in a community of less than 10,000 people would have to be open 1,480 hours per year in order to receive state funding, and a library that serves 10,000 to 19,000 people would have to be open 1,730 hours per year.
The library directors who spoke against the bill said this would disproportionately threaten rural libraries’ funding. McGraw called the provision an “unfunded mandate” and said it would apply unevenly to the branches he supervises in Conway and in rural areas.

Gosselink said the payroll and utility costs to meet the hours requirement at the Calhoun County Library’s main branch in Hampton would cost more than the state funding she currently receives, which is $7,100 per year.
“It’s my entire discretionary budget for programming, for books, for computers, for anything I might do that’s above and beyond opening the doors and turning on the lights,” she said.
Sullivan said county governments and taxpayers would be required to put in extra effort to make up for any library funding that might be lost, but he also said he doubted that libraries are at risk of losing funding in the first place.
McGraw challenged this statement and mentioned that the entire staff of the U.S. Institute of Museum and Library Services was put on administrative leave for 90 days Monday. Earlier in March, President Donald Trump issued an executive order to gut the federal agency that provides grant funding to libraries nationwide.
The Arkansas State Library distributes IMLS funds to Arkansas libraries. These funds support summer reading programs, interlibrary loan programs, resources for blind and print-disabled library patrons and state document depositories, Arkansas Library Association president and Garland County Library director Adam Webb told the Advocate.
McGraw called SB 536 “an unnecessary introduction of chaos” into the already uncertain landscape of library funding, and he said the bill does not include any metrics for measuring improvements within libraries that meet all of the bill’s state funding requirements.
The fourth library director to speak against the bill was Clare Graham, who oversees the five-county Mid-Arkansas Regional Library System.
“This bill imposes a one-size-fits-all approach that stifles creativity and flexibility,” Graham said. “Local libraries are already governed by their local boards that know their communities best. This bill takes that away, replacing it with centralized oversight that doesn’t understand the unique needs of each town and city.”
The full Senate will consider SB 536 Wednesday. The bill’s emergency clause requires two-thirds of the chamber’s support, or 24 votes.

However, it doesn’t appear that it was the funding levels that drew the ire of nearly every single senator on Tuesday.

Instead, Senate Majority Leader Lori Den Hartog, R-Meridian, said so-called budget intent language included in sections nine and 10 on page four of the bill could violate a provision of the Idaho Constitution. The Idaho Constitution prohibits the Idaho Legislature from “Authorizing the laying out, opening, altering, maintaining, working on, or vacating roads, highways, streets, alleys, town plats, parks, cemeteries, or any public grounds not owned by the state.”
Page four of Senate Bill 1205 calls for setting aside “at least $8,000,000 shall be used towards the construction of a road widening project and bridge reconstruction for congestion mitigation on a residential mobility arterial that connects a State Highway to a U.S. Highway.”
“Page four of the bill, section nine and 10, are the specific areas where I think we have some concerns and potentially are in violation of Article Three, Section 19 of our Constitution,” Den Hartog said. 
Boise Dev has reported that the intent language could force the Ada County Highway District, or ACHD, to spend millions on specific projects. 
Den Hartog expressed similar concerns Tuesday.
“There is only one highway district and one road in one county that is being directed to spend a certain amount of money in this budget, and for that reason, I cannot support this,” Den Hartog said. 
It was not immediately clear what happens next with the Idaho Transportation Department budget, but the Joint Finance-Appropriations Committee may elect to redo the budget before the Idaho Legislature adjourns its annual legislative session for the year.

The bill [&#8230;]","A bill targeting the swine farm moratorium in the Buffalo River watershed made it out of committee Tuesday. (Photo courtesy of National Park Service)A bill that could strip away an environmental permit moratorium intended to protect the water quality of the Buffalo River watershed passed out of a Senate committee Tuesday.
Senate Bill 290, sponsored by Sen. Blake Johnson, R-Corning, passed the Senate Agriculture, Forestry and Economic Development Committee on a voice vote, with audible dissent.
The bill has gone through multiple revisions since it was introduced and has sparked strong opposition from environmental groups in the state that said removing the permit moratorium could again allow another facility like C&H Hog Farms to open up shop in the watershed, endangering the Buffalo National River. The state of Arkansas spent $6.2 million to buy the farm and shut it down in 2019, after years of efforts led by groups such as the Buffalo River Watershed Alliance.
Unlike previous versions of the bill, the latest version would not immediately strike the moratorium that is currently in place, but would instead require the Department of Energy and Environment’s Division of Environmental Quality and the Department of Agriculture to go through the rulemaking process again for the rules that contain the moratorium if the bill goes into law. The effective date for the bill, if passed, is Jan. 1, 2026, and agencies would have 90 days from that date to get approval for a moratorium.
The rules containing the moratorium would then go back before the Arkansas Legislative Council or the Joint Budget Committee after agencies approve them through their usual rulemaking processes. The council, according to Johnson, would be granted greater leeway to reject the moratorium once it goes before them under his bill.
Moratoriums would expire four years after their effective date under the bill, requiring agencies to resubmit them for consideration and requiring legislative council approval every four years.
Sam Dubke, a spokesperson for Gov. Sarah Huckabee Sanders, said the governor would not support legislation that did not protect the river.
“Governor Sanders appreciates Senator Johnson’s leadership and dedication to Arkansas agriculture, but she is opposed to legislation that does not protect the Buffalo National River,” Dubke wrote in an emailed statement. 
Dubke did not say whether Sanders would sign the bill in its current form if it makes it through both chambers of the Legislature.
Multiple people spoke against the bill before the committee, urging lawmakers to protect “the jewel” of the state of Arkansas. 
Little Rock resident Richard Johnson said the moratorium needed to remain in place, citing pollution hazards posed by swine CAFOs, or concentrated animal feed operations.
“They tend to pollute way beyond their footprint,” Johnson said.
Mark Lambert, who represented Arkansas Farm Bureau, expressed support for the bill, saying that it was a “right-to-farm” issue. The bill wouldn’t take away any protections for the watershed — an assertion opponents of the bill pushed back against.
Committee members questioned why moratoriums would receive a “different threshold” for making it past the legislative council compared to other rules. Johnson said it was to return oversight to elected officials, and described the Buffalo River watershed moratorium, which has been in place for 10 years, as a slippery slope that could lead to other moratoriums. 
“This is oversight of executive branch departments,” Johnson said. “The moratorium is something that’s an outlier also, in my opinion as an agricultural producer, because that’s not allowing an agricultural producer to even apply for a permit. … This is telling a producer that he can’t even attempt to use his property in the way he wants to, and this can be expanded beyond just CAFOs.”
The only other watershed-based moratorium is for Lake Maumelle, a primary source of drinking water for the Central Arkansas region.
Johnson said everyone agrees that people don’t want CAFOs in the Buffalo River watershed and he didn’t think a producer would put one there in the first place.
However, there is a long history of swine farms within the watershed beyond C&H Hog Farms — something the DEQ said explicitly in its response to the Farm Bureau’s comments on changes to Rule 6 last year that would have made the moratorium permanent.
“The potential impacts of swine farms, including farms large enough to be considered CAFOs, on the Buffalo River have been an ongoing concern in Arkansas, and the Division (or its predecessors) have taken action to mitigate the impacts of existing farms in that watershed,” the division wrote last year. 
“In 1992, APC&EC Regulation 5 was adopted to address how liquid waste from swine farms should be handled. Also in 1992, the Arkansas Department of Pollution Control and Ecology (the Division’s predecessor) issued an administrative notice regarding its intent not to issue permits in the Buffalo River Watershed. Following … that notice, Arkansas participated in the Buffalo River Swine Waste Demonstration Project, which was initiated in 1995, to improve swine manure management in the Buffalo River watershed.”
Beth Ardapple, a Newton County farmer, called out a “false narrative” that farmers were opposed to a moratorium when she spoke against the bill. She said the Buffalo River has served as an affordable vacation spot for Arkansans for decades and that it needed to be protected. 
“I have great respect for my CAFO friends, people who own CAFOs. They love the land as I do. It’s simply that the science doesn’t support having the CAFO in the Buffalo River watershed,” Ardapple said.
Marti Olesen, the vice president of the Buffalo River Watershed Alliance, said her business on the river would not survive if a CAFO returned to the area and polluted the river. 
“There is no other Buffalo River in Arkansas; it’s a national treasure,” Olesen said.
John Ray, a self-described environmentalist, said that one was not against farming if they supported protecting the state’s natural resources. Fishing and hunting businesses in the area were supportive of a permanent moratorium, he said, and tourism on the Buffalo River supports hundreds of jobs for concessioners, lodges and others who cater to those who enjoy the river each year. 
“These things are not going to change every four years, and there is no slippery slope when it comes to these kinds of large CAFO moratoriums,” Ray said. “This moratorium in the Buffalo River has been in place for over ten years; there hasn’t been an avalanche of moratoriums on hog CAFOs in other areas of the state.”",https://arkansasadvocate.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Canoe-on-Buffalo-Fall-NPS-1024x662.jpeg,,,2025-04-01 22:02:04.406924

The reports circulated on social media claiming that there would be “more than 5,000 ICE agents patrolling the areas” in the two cities, as voters went to the polls to cast ballots in the April 1 election for candidates running for  Wisconsin Supreme Court, state superintendent, and referendum questions focusing on voter ID. 
Anxieties about ICE activities have been heightened under the Trump Administration. Recent weeks have seen videos showing plain-clothes, masked ICE agents detaining people on the street. Some of the detainees had been arrested after participating in activist activities, such as protests calling for an end to the war in Gaza. Fears of ICE raids have increased  in Milwaukee and Madison, as in other cities. 
Spokespersons for Milwaukee and Madison city government told Wisconsin Examiner that they have not heard any reports, complaints, or notifications about ICE agents at polling places. A spokesperson for the ICE office in Milwaukee said, “due to our operational tempo and the increased interest in our agency, we are not able to research and respond to rumors or specifics of routine daily operations for ICE.”
Meanwhile, turnout in Milwaukee has been so high that local news outlets are reporting that polling sites across the city have run out of ballots. The city’s Election’s Commission is arranging for fresh ballots to be sent to polling stations. In Tuesday’s election Republican-backed Supreme Court candidate and former Wisconsin attorney general Brad Schimel is facing off  against Dane County Judge Susan Crawford, who has the backing of state Democrats. In the  state superintendent’s race, incumbent Jill Underly is facing challenger Brittany y Kinser. Wisconsinites will also get to decide whether the state’s constitution should be amended to codify a voter ID requirement.

(Photo by Michael Salerno/Rhode Island Current)Those accused of working together to steal from retailers in Rhode Island could face felony charges under legislation under consideration in the state Senate.
The bill sponsored by Sen. Leonidas Raptakis, a Coventry Democrat, would impose up to five years in prison and a fine of up to $5,000 if two or more people are found guilty — the same punishment given to a repeat offender who has taken over $100 worth of merchandise. The bill would take effect upon its passage.
This is the second straight year Raptakis has filed a proposal to crack down on retail crime. Opponents argue it would disproportionately impact low-income youth. But Raptakis told the Senate Judiciary Committee that shoplifting will only continue to grow if it’s treated as a petty crime.
Under existing law, first-time offenders are charged with a misdemeanor punishable by up to one year in prison and a fine of at least $50 — or two times the full retail value of the merchandise that was reportedly stolen, whichever is greater.
“You see them all the time — individuals run into a store and steal probably tens of thousands of dollars in a matter of minutes,” Raptakis said. “Hopefully we can do something to toughen our statutes to send a strong message against organized shoplifting.”
Should the General Assembly move forward on the bill, Rhode Island would join a growing number of states, including Vermont, that have tried to crack down on rising retail theft. Major retailers have also taken measures to curb shoplifting, often by locking up merchandise.
“Even Mucinex, a cough syrup, is locked up,” Raptakis said.

Stricter penalties cannot come soon enough for Nick Fede Jr., director of the Rhode Island Liquor Operators Collaborative. He told the committee that package stores are frequent targets for shoplifters, leading to fewer expensive beverages on display.
“There’s a romance to what we do,” he said. “People want to pick the bottle up, they want to feel it.”
While store owners are used to petty theft, Fede told lawmakers that groups of shoplifters only target items with high resale value.
“This is not unique to any specific geographic area of our state,” Fede said. “It’s happening everywhere.”
It’s especially been true for Providence and Warwick, both of which are home to malls. Providence Police reported 365 reported shoplifting offenses in 2024, representing a 52% increase from the year prior.
A 2023 report from the Warwick Police Department, the most recent available, notes 388 cases of shoplifting — representing an 8% increase from the prior year.
“Organized retail theft is a true concern of ours and exists at a pretty steady rate,” Warwick Police Chief Bradford Connor said in an email to Rhode Island Current.
But the bill has sparked serious warnings from the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) of Rhode Island and the state’s Office of the Public Defender.
ACLU Executive Director Steven Brown called Raptakis’ bill “a rather draconian penalty.”
“Shoplifting some item from a local store shouldn’t lead to such an excessive, such an incredibly harsh, prison sentence,” he said in an interview.
Megan F. Jackson, legislative liaison for the public defender’s office, wrote to the committee that the bill takes “an overtly harsh approach” and that the language is unclear on how such a law would actually be applied.
“The law would undoubtedly have a disproportionate impact on vulnerable communities already overrepresented in the criminal justice system, especially given that shoplifting is often driven by poverty,” Jackson wrote. “At best, it is counterproductive; at worst, it could be unconstitutional.”
Raptakis’ bill was held by committee for further study, as is common practice when legislation is first considered. Companion legislation has not been filed in the House.

Cory Booker broke the record for longest floor speech in the history of the Senate on Tuesday, surpassing the 24-hour and 18-minute record set in 1957 when South Carolina’s Strom Thurmond attempted to prevent passage of the Civil Rights Act.
Booker, a Democrat who began his remarks Monday at 7 p.m. saying he wanted to highlight President Donald Trump’s “complete disregard for the rule of law,” by Tuesday at 7:20 p.m. was raspy-voiced, occasionally teary-eyed, and wearing what he called a “ripe” shirt.
It was New York Sen. Chuck Schumer, the Senate’s Democratic leader, who interrupted Booker to say he had broken Thurmond’s record.
“Do you know how proud this caucus is of you? Do you know how proud America is of you?” Schumer said to applause and a standing ovation from his fellow Democrats and visitors.
Booker noted that Thurmond with his 1957 filibuster “tried to stop the rights upon which I stand.”
“I’m not here, though, because of his speech. I’m here despite his speech. I’m here because, as powerful as he was, the people were more powerful,” Booker said.
Wyoming Sen. Cynthia Lummis was one of just two Republican lawmakers in the chamber at the time. Lummis joined Democrats in celebrating Booker’s accomplishment by standing and clapping.
Guests and staff are normally barred from any displays of support or disapproval while sitting in the gallery, but Utah Sen. John Curtis, a Republican who was presiding over the chamber, allowed it.
Booker finally yielded the floor a few minutes after 8 p.m. Tuesday.
Booker’s record-breaking speech comes as the Democratic Party faces criticism from voters who say the party’s leaders are not doing enough to stand up to Trump’s actions, especially those that experts say fly in the face of legal precedent.
“These are not normal times in our nation, and they should not be treated as such in the United States Senate,” Booker said at one point. “The threats to the American people and American democracy are grave and urgent, and we all must do more to stand against them.”
The senator covered a breadth of topics: health care, Social Security, Medicaid, grocery prices, free speech, veterans, public education, world leaders, Elon Musk’s Department of Government Efficiency, and national security concerns. He read letters and comments from constituents and he quoted speeches from the late Rep. John Lewis — invoking Lewis’ famous call to action to “get in good trouble” — and the late Sen. John McCain.
“This is not right or left. It is right or wrong. This is not a partisan moment. It is a moral moment,” Booker said. “Where do you stand?”
Booker, 55, a former mayor of Newark, also assailed Trump’s policies on immigration. He said the Trump administration is doing “outrageous things like disappearing people off of American streets, violating fundamental principles of this document” — here he held up a copy of the U.S. Constitution — “invoking the Alien Enemies Act from the 1700s that was last used to put Japanese Americans into internment camps.”
“Do we see what’s happening?” Booker asked.
He spent about a half-hour reading the account of Jasmine Mooney, a Canadian citizen who was detained by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement for 12 days in March. He also noted that the Trump administration conceded Monday that it deported Kilmar Abrego Garcia, a 29-year-old Maryland man with protected legal status, to an El Salvador prison because of an “administrative error.”
“The government can’t walk up to a human being and grab them off the street and put them on a plane and send them to one of the most notorious prisons in the world, and just say, as one of our authorities did, ‘Oopsie,’ ” Booker said.

(Antoinette Grajeda/Arkansas Advocate)The Arkansas Senate on Tuesday rejected a $750 million appropriation bill to support construction of a 3,000-bed prison in Franklin County. 
The bill’s failure marked the latest hurdle in constructing a prison in the rural western Arkansas county, which supporters, including the governor, have said is needed to alleviate overcrowding in county jails. 
Sen. Jonathan Dismang, a Searcy Republican and lead sponsor of Senate Bill 354, assured his colleagues they would be involved throughout the process because the executive branch will have to submit funding requests for different phases of construction that will require approval from the Arkansas Legislative Council before money can be spent.
Work is underway on an accountability plan with the Department of Corrections to ensure lawmakers are “tracking, monitoring and understanding the process and the progress of the prison construction,” Dismang said. 
“I understand that the members want to be engaged in this process as it moves it forward regardless of what happens with this appropriation, and you’re going to have the ability to do that,” he said.  
The Franklin County prison has been controversial since state and local officials and community members said they were blindsided when Gov. Sarah Huckabee Sanders in late October announced the state’s $2.95 million purchase of 815 acres near Charleston for the project. In the months since, elected officials and local residents have continued to speak out against the prison. 
Officials last month issued a preliminary cost estimate of $825 million. The Legislature previously set aside $330 million for the proposed penitentiary, adding to another $75 million that had been set aside during former Gov. Asa Hutchinson’s administration.
Arkansas lawmakers advance $750 million appropriation bill for prison construction

Senate President Pro Tempore Sen. Bart Hester, R-Cave Springs, spoke in favor of SB 354 Tuesday. From the Senate floor, he recounted the story of Shawna Cash, who was arrested and released multiple times, including in Washington County where he said she was released in May 2021 because there was no room. 
Former Washington County Prosecutor Matt Durrett told the Arkansas-Democrat Gazette that COVID-19 pandemic precautions explained Cash’s release because it was common to release more inmates than usual to reduce populations and the risk of transmitting the virus. 
Cash was accused of striking and killing a Pea Ridge police officer Kevin Apple with her vehicle in June 2021. A jury convicted Cash of capital murder and sentenced her to life in prison without parole last year.
“There’s many Shawna Cashes in every one of our districts right now,” Hester said. “They should be in prison, but there is no room…we’ve got to have room, and I am begging you to not have something horrible happen in your district when we could have made a difference today.”
Sen. John Payton, R-Wilburn, who said he supports expanding prison capacity, spoke against the bill Tuesday, echoing his concerns from last month’s Joint Budget Committee meeting that there isn’t a large enough available workforce to support a large prison in that part of the state. 
When the governor began pushing for a prison after taking office in 2023, Payton said, there was “a pretty good dustup” between Sanders and the corrections board, whose members said they could not safely expand bed capacity because of a lack of staff.
“I understand it’s an appropriation and it’s not funding, but it’s a bad business decision,” Payton said. “And I’m not going to be responsible a year or two years from now when we spend three-quarters of a billion dollars, we’ve got the most beautiful, up-to-date, modern facility, we came in under budget and nobody to work there.”
Dismang said there are “other pieces to this puzzle,” specifically noting the governor’s overhaul of the state employee pay plan, which the Senate advanced Tuesday, “contemplates significant increases in pay for those working in our prison system.”
The argument did not sway Payton, who voted against SB 354 along with fellow Republicans Ron Caldwell, Jimmy Hickey, Ricky Hill, Bryan King, Clint Penzo, Terry Rice and Gary Stubblefield, and Democrats Greg Leding and Clarke Tucker. 
The bill garnered 19 votes in support, but failed because appropriation bills require 27 votes to advance out of the Senate. Dismang could bring the bill back for consideration because there is no limit to how many times lawmakers can vote on an appropriation bill. There is a deadline for the end of the legislative session, however, which lawmakers anticipate will be April 16.

Randy Fine (Photo via Florida House of Representatives website)Republicans are celebrating in Florida and Washington, D.C., tonight, after two more of their ranks are going to Congress to pad the Republicans’ narrow lead over Democrats in the U.S. House of Representatives.
In the Congressional District 6 race in Northeast Florida, former state Sen. Randy Fine from Brevard County has defeated Democrat Josh Weil, an Orlando school teacher. Some polls showed Weil running competitively in the district, which went for Republican Mike Waltz over his Democratic opponent by 37 points in November.
With 95% of the votes counted, Fine led Weil with 56.5% to 44.5%.
In the District 1 race in Florida’s Panhandle, former Florida Chief Financial Officer Jimmy Patronis has defeated gun safety activist Democrat Gay Valimont, 56.1% to 42.8%. That was with 89% of the votes cast in the district.
Florida’s 6th District encompasses Flagler, Lake, Marion, Putnam, St. Johns, and Volusia counties. Neither Fine nor Weil live in the district.
Waltz served there for the past six years. Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis represented the area from 2012-2018.
Undoubtedly, Trump’s endorsement benefitted Fine, although DeSantis said earlier on Tuesday that the president got “bad advice” to endorse him.
“I think the Republican will win, but he will underperform because a lot of Republicans aren’t going to be willing to go out and vote for him,” DeSantis told conservative talk-show host Dana Loesch.
“I mean, you had him on your show, he was fighting for an amnesty bill in the Florida Legislature, he was attacking me for wanting strong immigration legislation. And so when voters see that, it’s like, you know what? Why would I want to vote for you if you’re just going to stab us in the back?”
The two had been close allies until the fall of 2023, when Fine blamed the governor for his handling of Jewish concerns following the Hamas attack on Israel and came out to endorse Trump for president.
Although most Democrats knew it would be a miracle to upset a Republican in the district, the huge fundraising advantage that Weil enjoyed (approximately $10 million for Weil to $2 million for Fine) had given them hopes that they could substantially reduce the margin of defeat.

“As Ronald Reagan said, ‘there you go again,’’ said Florida political strategist Barry Edwards. “This is another example of the Democrats overpromising and underdelivering, which is going to have an immediate effect of disillusioning the many donors and volunteers who helped on these races that thought that they were competitive, but they weren’t. And shame on the Democratic leadership, because they knew better.”
Democratic National Committee Chair Ken Martin made a trip to District 6 over the weekend on behalf of the Weil campaign.
Weil released a statement shortly after the polls closed.
“The numbers didn’t add up in our favor today,” he said. “We shouldn’t be disappointed however, this race was closer than anyone ever imagined. In a district won by Mike Walz by 32 points, we closed that gap by a historic margin. An incredible gain. This progress is because of our grassroots supporters across the country and the voters in this district – Democrats, Republicans, and Independents — who believe in a brighter and kinder future. This result is also a warning sign to Donald Trump, Randy Fine, and the unelected oligarchs taking apart the government. Should they continue to steal people’s hard-earned money and benefits like Social Security and Medicare, defund education, focus more on culture wars than lowering costs: the backlash is only beginning.”
Florida’s 1st District sits in the far Northwestern Florida, encompassing  Escambia, Okaloosa, Santa Rosa, and parts of Walton County. Valimont raised $6.3 million from Jan. 9 through March 12, compared to Patronis, who raised $1.1 million.
Patronis had been considering a run for governor before Trump came out and endorsed him almost immediately after the seat became vacant following Trump’s selecting Matt Gaetz to leave the district to serve as his attorney general. (Gaetz ended up withdrawing from consideration for the position).
Patronis won the Republican primary election for CD-1 in late January, defeating nine opponents.
“That’s just an example of Donald Trump being more strategic than people give him credit for,” Edwards said, noting that Trump endorsed Patronis immediately after the District 1 seat became vacant.
“He wanted to have the field cleared for Byron Donalds, so he calls up Jimmy Patronis, who had told people he wasn’t going to run for Congress, and he endorses him. Four months later, Patronis is the congressman, which opens up the CFO seat for his buddy Joe Gruters and the governor’s seat for Byron Donalds.”
Gruters, a Sarasota-based state Senator, has already announced his candidacy for chief financial officer in 2026 and has been endorsed by Trump for that seat. Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis isn’t expected to announce a successor to Patronis for the CFO spot until sometime after the Florida legislative session ends in May. He is not expected to name Gruters, who endorsed Trump over DeSantis for president in 2023.",https://floridaphoenix.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Patronis-and-Fine-1024x577.png,,,2025-04-01 20:59:07.381262

(Lindsey Toomer/Colorado Newsline)A bipartisan bill would restructure the vacancy committee process to replace members of the Colorado Legislature based on when a vacancy occurs, such as when a member resigns.
House Bill 25-1315 was introduced on Monday, about three months into a lawmaking session that has seen a handful of vacancy committee appointments. It would have vacancy-appointed lawmakers run for their seat in either a regularly-scheduled general election or odd-year special election.
“Vacancies in the General Assembly are an issue I heard about as I traveled the state as the Minority Leader. The people want to preserve the vacancy committee process while also having the opportunity to vote for their legislators. This bill will do both,” House Minority Leader Rose Pugliese, a Colorado Springs Republican, said in a statement.
It is sponsored by Pugliese, Rep. Emily Sirota, a Denver Democrat, Sen. Mike Weissman, an Aurora Democrat, and Sen. Barbara Kirkmeyer, a Weld County Republican.
The bill would set the following guidelines for vacancy committees:

If a lawmaker resigns before July 31 in an even year, a committee would appoint a replacement and that person would need to run for the seat that November.
If a lawmaker resigns on or after July 31 in an even year, a committee would appoint a replacement and they would run for the seat in the next year’s November vacancy election.
If a lawmaker resigns before July 31 in an odd year, a committee would appoint a replacement and there would be a vacancy election that November.
If a lawmaker resigns on or after July 31 in an odd year, a committee would pick a replacement and that person would need to run for the seat in the next general election.

The effect of the change would be that appointed lawmakers serve one legislative session, which runs from January to May, until they need to run for reelection, either in a regular election or a vacancy election as created by the bill.
The new odd-year vacancy elections would take place alongside the statewide elections for ballot issues, local candidates and other items. Unaffiliated voters and voters from the same political party as the lawmaker who resigned in the legislative district would be able to participate in the new new odd-year vacancy elections.
Six lawmakers already appointed this year
Candidates could make the ballot for that election by collecting 200 signatures of voters from their party or by getting the support of at least 30% of the district’s vacancy committee.
Vacancy committees are currently composed of party central committee members, precinct leaders and state lawmakers who live in the district, as well as other highly involved party members. That means committees are typically made up of a few dozen people, but they can be much smaller. The bill would extend committee membership to county commissioners of the same party who live in the district.
The bill would also require vacancy committees to be livestreamed for the public. It also imposes campaign finance requirements for vacancy candidates.
Six lawmakers have been appointed via vacancy committee this year: Republican Sen. John Carson, Democratic Sen. Matt Ball, Democratic Sen. Iman Jodeh, Democratic Rep. Jamie Jackson and Democratic Sen. Katie Wallace. That high volume of appointments — two of which came when lawmakers resigned immediately after winning reelections — led to calls for process reform.
“For the past few years, voters have grown increasingly alarmed with our vacancy laws for important elected government offices,” Kirkmeyer said in a statement. “A handful of political insiders should not determine who sits in a state legislative seat for years at a time without voters being able to express their will. I’m pleased to be part of a bipartisan coalition that brings impactful reform to this process.”
A separate resolution in the Legislature also targets vacancy reform. House Concurrent Resolution 25-1002, also introduced Monday, would ask voters to amend the state constitution so that appointed lawmakers could not run as an incumbent in the election following their appointment. Rep. Bob Marshall, a Highlands Ranch Democrat, ran a similar resolution last year and is sponsoring it again this year alongside Rep. Larry Don Suckla, a Cortez Republican, and Sen. Marc Snyder, a Manitou Springs Democrat.

SB 110, sponsored by Sen. Jack Williams, R-Wilmer, would limit the number of trucks that can be pulled over to five at roadside weigh stations. Previously, there was no limit, which caused long lines of trucks on the sides of highways and caused truckers to lose work hours.
“If you’re taking a day off being in court, and then they may put it off then when it gets there. So we’ve got a win-win. We just didn’t get the axle weight,” Williams said after the bill’s passage.

The bill passed 32-0 after senators removed a provision that would have increased weight limits for log truck drivers for each axle over concerns about damage to road infrastructure. Williams said that was a deal he accepted as early as Tuesday morning but that he’d try to address weight limits in the future.
The amendment, proposed by Sen. Clyde Chambliss, R-Prattville, would try to ease delays experienced by truck drivers, particularly those hauling logs, pointing to the possible economic impact of these delays.
“If you’re hung up on the side of the road for an hour, two hours, three hours, depending on how many trucks are backed up, well, you’ve lost money that day,” Chambliss said.
The bill also provides an appeals process for truck drivers who receive overweight citations based on portable scale measurements, aimed at addressing the potential of inaccurate portable scale readings.
While the bill aims to address efficiency and economic concerns, Williams said that weight limit issues, particularly concerning the hauling of 40-foot logs, require further attention. He said that logs cause more weights to be distributed unevenly between axles, causing drivers to haul fewer logs to comply with Alabama law.
“40-foot logs – that rear axle is going to get overloaded when you’ve got logs sticking all the way out there … if you’re hauling them legally, you’re hauling half a load of logs,” Williams said.
He said that weight limits were relaxed during the COVID pandemic, and he was not aware of any data that indicated roads were damaged during that time.
“That’s what I’d like to have back,” he said.

  The Wisconsin Examiner’s Criminal Justice Reporting Project shines a light on incarceration, law enforcement and criminal justice issues with support from the Public Welfare Foundation.
Chief of Police T.J. Bill said there had been ground, air and water searches using drones and dogs, and images from over 300 reservation surveillance cameras have been reviewed for clues.
Beson, a member of the Lac du Flambeau Band of Lake Superior Chippewa Indians, was last seen in the vicinity of Indian Village Road and Chequamegon Forest Trail in Lac du Flambeau.
She was last seen wearing red sweatpants, a black sleeveless shirt, and a gray sweatshirt.
Beson is a Native American female, 5’7”, with a medium build, brown hair and brown eyes. She has numerous tattoos, including on her neck, arms and leg.
Beson’s family reported her missing on March 23, six days after she was last seen.
“Finding her has been the number one priority of the LDF Police Department,” Bill in a statement. “We have conducted extensive ground searches on foot, even in severe weather conditions. Our officers have even come in on their days off to search for her. The dedicated members of Newbold Search and Rescue have once again come to our aid and have assisted us by searching with their specially trained canines.The dogs have shown interest and appeared to pick up Melissa’s scent in the area of her last known sighting.”
The LDF Police Department has used two high-quality drones to search a portion of the Bear River’s open water and plans to use an underwater drone to dive under ice.
“Although we are expending monumental efforts in searching the area in which Mellisa was last seen, we are in no way ignoring the possibility that she may be elsewhere,” said Bill. “Our officers are working non-stop, during every shift, to follow up on every lead and tip that we receive. We have combed through countless hours of surveillance footage, have interviewed dozens of people, and have reached out to law enforcement agencies in various areas of the State of Wisconsin, who have assisted us by contacting persons with possible information and even conducting searches of residences in their jurisdictions.”
Bill told the Examiner that the LDF Police Department has reviewed surveillance footage from over 300 cameras monitored around the reservation.
“So nothing’s been revealed on them, on the surveillance of the cameras, where she was last seen,” he said. Where Beson was last seen is “in more of a desolate area,” he added, “so we don’t have cameras that go out that far.”
He also noted that the ground searches using dogs had been hampered by recent weather, including snow.
“We would like to extend our sincere appreciation to LDF Emergency Management, LDF Tribal Roads Department, LDF Economic Support Department, Newbold Search and Rescue, the Vilas County Sheriff’s Department, and Vilas County Dispatch for their vital assistance to our investigative and search efforts,” he said.
He added, “We would also like to thank everyone in the community who has provided assistance to our Department and been supportive to Melisa’s family during this difficult time.”
Anyone with information is encouraged to call the Lac du Flambeau Tribal Police Department. at (715) 588-7717 or the Vilas County Sheriff’s Office at (715) 479-4441.

Strom Thurmond's record for longest filibuster on Tuesday after speaking for over 24 hours and 18 minutes.  (John Partipilo/Tennessee Lookout)This story originally appeared on New Jersey Monitor.

U.S. Sen. Cory Booker broke the record for longest floor speech in the history of the Senate on Tuesday, surpassing the 24-hour and 18-minute record set in 1957 when South Carolina’s Strom Thurmond attempted to prevent passage of the Civil Rights Act.
Booker, a Democrat who began his remarks Monday at 7 p.m. saying he wanted to highlight President Donald Trump’s “complete disregard for the rule of law,” by Tuesday at 7:20 p.m. was raspy-voiced, occasionally teary-eyed, and wearing what he called a “ripe” shirt.
It was Sen. Chuck Schumer, D-New York, the Senate’s minority leader, who interrupted Booker to say he had broken Thurmond’s record.

“Do you know how proud this caucus is of you? Do you know how proud America is of you?” Schumer said to applause from his fellow Democrats.
Booker noted that Thurmond with his 1957 filibuster “tried to stop the rights upon which I stand.”
“I’m not here, though, because of his speech. I’m here despite his speech. I’m here because, as powerful as he was, the people were more powerful,” Booker said.
Booker’s record-breaking speech comes as the Democratic Party faces criticism from voters who say the party’s leaders are not doing enough to stand up to Trump’s actions, especially those that experts say fly in the face of legal precedent.
“These are not normal times in our nation, and they should not be treated as such in the United States Senate,” Booker said at one point. “The threats to the American people and American democracy are grave and urgent, and we all must do more to stand against them.”
The senator covered a breadth of topics: health care, Social Security, Medicaid, grocery prices, free speech, veterans, public education, world leaders, Elon Musk’s Department of Government Efficiency, and national security concerns. He read letters and comments from constituents and he quoted speeches from the late Rep. John Lewis — invoking Lewis’ famous call to action to “get in good trouble” — and the late Sen. John McCain.
“This is not right or left. It is right or wrong. This is not a partisan moment. It is a moral moment,” Booker said. “Where do you stand?”
Booker, 55, a former mayor of Newark, also assailed Trump’s policies on immigration. He said the Trump administration is doing “outrageous things like disappearing people off of American streets, violating fundamental principles of this document” — here he held up a copy of the U.S. Constitution — “invoking the Alien Enemies Act from the 1700s that was last used to put Japanese Americans into internment camps.”
“Do we see what’s happening?” Booker asked.
He spent about a half-hour reading the account of Jasmine Mooney, a Canadian citizen who was detained by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement for 12 days in March. He also noted that the Trump administration conceded Monday that it deported Kilmar Abrego Garcia, a 29-year-old Maryland man with protected legal status, to an El Salvador prison because of an “administrative error.”
“The government can’t walk up to a human being and grab them off the street and put them on a plane and send them to one of the most notorious prisons in the world, and just say, as one of our authorities did, ‘Oopsie,’” Booker said.

(McKenzie Romero/Utah News Dispatch)Are diversity, equity and inclusion programs explicitly “attempting to achieve the Soviet Communist goal of actual equality”? That will be part of a resolution the Utah State Board of Education is scheduled to discuss, and perhaps adopt, on Thursday.
Five Republican board members signed on to back a proposed resolution to remove DEI from Utah schools — Christina Boggess of Taylorsville, Cole Kelley of Vineyard, Joann Brinton of St. George, Rod Hall of Syracuse, and Emily Green of Cedar City — supporting a draft containing Trump Administration orders and a lot of Soviet Union terminology. 
“The Utah State Board of Education directs its employees and subsequent staff, instructional and administrative personnel to immediately disband any and all ‘Diversity, Equity and Inclusion Practices;’” the proposal reads. “Moreover, the agency shall immediately disband and rescind all associated documents, training, programs, curriculum and policies.”
SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
The state school board still doesn’t have an official statement on the resolution since the board hasn’t discussed it yet, a communications person for the board said, and Boggess, who is coordinating the effort, didn’t reply to a request for comment on Tuesday. 
The move stirred concerns from Utahns who oppose more DEI regulation in the state’s education system. Especially, since there’s already a Utah law in place that tightly restricts deploying DEI programs. 
When HB261 became law in the summer of 2024, all public institutions in Utah banned programs that “promote differential treatment” and may exclude some based on their race, color, ethnicity, sex, sexual orientation, national origin, religion or gender identity. 
As anti-DEI law takes effect, students and staffers share ‘great sense of loss’

“Of all of the anti-DEI things I’ve read in politics and in policy, this is the most far reaching and the most frightening,” Sarah Reale, one of two Democrats among the 15 state school board members, said on Tuesday. 
Citing the recent implementation of that anti-DEI policy, Reale questioned the necessity of such a resolution when Utah schools have spent the last year making substantial cuts to diversity programs and are already in compliance with new federal orders prohibiting DEI.
“We have tons of work to do — helping students’ math scores improve, helping find ways to provide teachers with professional development opportunities, finding ways to support parents in the schools.” Reale said. “So to spend time on something that, to me, is blatantly just inciting fear, and that doesn’t help our teachers or students in their learning environment (…) is embarrassing. The resolution is embarrassing.”
Utah State Board of Education resolutions aren’t binding, they are just approved statements that express the opinion of the board’s majority. However, the draft resolution cites a Utah Constitution provision that gives the board control and supervision powers over public schools and programs designated by the Legislature. 
However, Reale said, whether or not the resolution is enforceable isn’t the main issue. 
“It’s the principle, it’s the tone, it’s the message that it sends that’s hurtful and scary,” she said. Approving these kinds of resolutions, “feels very Big Brother, very big government,” which, she added, isn’t the role of the state school board. 
Soviet terms in Utah schools?
The resolution explains how a series of words and programs used in the Soviet Union may relate to DEI efforts —  “коренизация (korenizatsiya), which maps to ‘inclusion,’ and разнообразие (raznoobrazsiya), which means ‘diversity,’ in the sense meant by Lenin who described it as ‘diversity in form to arrive at unity in content.’ DEI at its core is 1920s Soviet Union policy for using ethnic minorities to advance the installation of Communism,” the five board members wrote in the resolution.
The authors also criticized the terms “identity politics” and “inclusion,” which they define as “programs, processes or implemented ideas that emphasize including, affirming and protecting counter-hegemonic perspectives at the expense of universal and objective truth.”



Let us know what you think...


 


Those correlations, Reale said, are false analogies.
“You cannot say that words in different languages mean the same thing and cross over with the same definition in English,” she said. “It feels very McCarthyism. It screams Red Scare. It’s frightening language.”
The resolution also has DEI as a synonym of Critical Race Theory, an academic discipline examining racial disparities in the country, which has existed for decades but became a hot culture war debate during Trump’s first term.
“DEI is not equal to CRT,” Reale said. “CRT is not found in any of our schools. We have looked and reviewed for anything that could be even a glimmer of CRT taught in our schools in Utah. They don’t exist.

The law, Act 689 of 2023, was the first of its kind in the nation and was a priority of Gov. Sarah Huckabee Sanders in her first year in office. It required social media platforms to verify the age of all account holders in Arkansas. Those under 18 could only access sites with parental permission.
U.S. District Judge Timothy L. Brooks of the Western District of Arkansas said in Monday’s ruling that Act 689 “would violate the First Amendment rights of Arkansans” because it is a “content-based restriction on speech that is not narrowly tailored to serve a compelling government interest.” The law also would violate the due process rights of the plaintiffs, the judge wrote.
The ruling marked the first permanent injunction that NetChoice, the nonprofit trade association for large tech companies that brought the suit, has obtained against similar laws it has challenged as violating free speech and enterprise online, according to a press release. 
NetChoice filed its lawsuit against the state in June 2023, and Brooks issued a preliminary injunction that August, about two weeks before the law was set to take effect on Sept. 1.   
The court’s ruling confirms NetChoice’s argument that restricting access to protected speech violates the First Amendment, the group’s litigation director, Chris Marchese, said in a statement. 
“This ruling protects Americans from having to hand over their IDs or biometric data just to access constitutionally protected speech online,” Marchese said. “It reaffirms that parents — not politicians or bureaucrats — should decide what’s appropriate for their children.”
Arkansas Attorney General Tim Griffin said in a statement Tuesday that he respects the court’s decision, adding that his office is evaluating its options.
Sanders called for lawmakers to amend Act 689 during her January State of the State address “so that it’s no longer held up in court and can begin to be enforced.” 
To date, no such amendments to the law have been proposed, but Sen. Bart Hester, R-Cave Springs, told the Advocate last week he expects it to “happen one way or another” since the governor said it’s important to her. 
Brooks’ 41-page opinion on Monday granted NetChoice’s motion for summary judgment and declared that “NetChoice members and their users will suffer irreparable harm” if Act 689 takes effect because it “abridges the First Amendment rights of Arkansans who use social media and contains terms too vague to be reasonably understood.”
“The Court does not doubt the reality, well supported by the record, that unfettered social media access can and does harm minors,” Brooks wrote, adding that the state does have a compelling interest in protecting minors. 
“The state does not, however, have ‘a free-floating power to restrict the ideas to which children may be exposed,’” he said, quoting from another court’s opinion.

The law is “maximally burdensome” on both the social media platforms and the users it targets, the judge wrote.
“It erects barriers to accessing entire social media platforms rather than placing those barriers around the content or functions that raise concern,” he said. “It not only hinders adults’ ability to speak and receive protected speech online, it excludes minors whose parents do not consent (or cannot prove their consent)” from accessing forums on the internet.
If the Legislature’s intent “was to protect minors from materials or interactions that could harm them online, there is no evidence that the Act will be effective in achieving that goal,” the judge said.
“Rather than targeting content that is harmful to minors, Act 689 simply impedes access to content writ large.”  
The law also “is unclear which NetChoice members are subject to regulation,” forcing some companies “to choose between risking enforcement penalties … and implementing age-verification requirements that burden their users’ First Amendment rights,” Brooks wrote.
NetChoice members whom the Act clearly regulates “would be pressed into service as the private censors of the State,” Brooks noted. “No legal remedy exists to compensate Arkansans for the loss of their First Amendment rights.”
The state argued that the act’s language made it clear that it covers Meta, Twitter (now X) and TikTok, but NetChoice argued that members like Snapchat, Nextdoor and Pinterest couldn’t be certain the law does not apply to them, according to the ruling. The state responded that the law didn’t apply to Snapchat because “it’s ‘different from a traditional social media platform.’” The law also specifically exempted YouTube and Google from having to verify users’ age.
The act is unconstitutionally vague because “it fails to adequately define which entities are subject to its requirements, risking chilling effects and inviting arbitrary enforcement,” according to the ruling.
Brooks concludes by stating “Act 689 is a content-based restriction on speech, and it is not targeted to address the harms the State has identified. Arkansas takes a hatchet to adults’ and minors’ protected speech alike though the Constitution demands it use a scalpel.”

Joe Lombardo speaking in Las Vegas Tuesday. (Photo: April Corbin Girnus/Nevada Current)Republican Gov. Joe Lombardo on Tuesday downplayed concerns about the potential consequences of tariffs and other economic policies imposed by the Trump administration, saying Nevada will “make adjustments on the fly.”
Lombardo made his comments in Las Vegas at a press conference at a soon-to-open affordable housing complex for seniors, where he was highlighting his housing bill. The Nevada Housing Access and Attainability Act, as Assembly Bill 540 has been named, will be heard by the Nevada State Legislature’s Assembly Commerce and Labor Committee on Wednesday night. It promises to leverage $250 million in state funds to support more than $1 billion of new housing projects.
When asked about Trump tariffs driving up the cost of constructing new homes, Lombardo acknowledged that “tariffs are the great unknown,” before pivoting to saying his housing legislation is designed to be flexible enough to react to the needs of developers.
“We’ll make adjustments on the fly,” he said.
Housing groups have warned that Trump tariffs on lumber, steel, aluminium and other key goods will increase the cost of constructing homes. The National Association of Home Builders, whose Southern Nevada affiliate participated in Lombardo’s press event Tuesday, have estimated that 7% of all goods used in new residential construction are imported.
When asked about Trump’s broader economic policies and their potential negative impact on Nevada’s economy, Lombardo responded that it is the obligation of the governor and the Legislature to identify the state’s needs and prioritize.
“You have to triage what your priorities are,” he said. “You have to identify what the problems are, what the priorities are, and housing is a priority. Housing is a priority and we’ll make adjustments within the state budget’s services.”
Lombardo in his response also alluded to recent conversations about potential cuts to Medicaid and Medicare. Those concerns, which were raised via letters and legislative hearings, are still pending as the federal budgeting process continues. Legislative Republicans have suggested they’d be more open to cutting services than raising revenue to backfill federal cuts.
Early data suggests international visitation to the United States is rapidly declining due to concerns about Trump’s trade wars, immigration enforcement without due process, and outlandish proposals to buy or take over other countries.
Lombardo, who was endorsed by Trump, has previously said that “Trump will bring down the rising costs of housing, groceries, and gas” and “oversee a new era of American prosperity.”

Over the last two years, the Idaho Legislature’s Joint Finance-Appropriations Committee has been setting budgets differently by breaking the budgets into two pieces. 
The first piece is called a maintenance of operations budget. The maintenance budget represents a bare-bones version of the previous year’s budget with all of the one-time funding and new funding requests stripped out. The maintenance budget is simply intended to keep the lights on for state agencies. The maintenance budget for the Idaho Public Defender’s Office was included in an earlier bill, Senate Bill 1109, which Gov. Brad Little signed into law March 18.
The second piece of the budget is referred to as budget enhancements, or the enhanced budget. Budget enhancements include new funding requests or requests for additional staff positions. 
The budget enhancements for the Idaho Public Defender’s Office were included in Senate Bill 1202, which the Idaho House took up Tuesday. Combined with the maintenance budget, the budget enhancements bring total funding for fiscal year 2026 for the Idaho Public Defender’s Office to $83.2 million. The Joint Finance-Appropriations Committee, or JFAC, cut about $5 million from Gov. Brad Little’s $88.6 million funding request.
One of the differences between Little’s budget request and Senate Bill 1202 has to do with funding for personnel costs. Little sought to increase the rate for contracted attorneys from $100 per hour to $150 per hour. Senate Bill 1202 sets that rate at $125 per hour.

  Idaho is transitioning to a new statewide public defense system 

In October, Idaho transitioned from paying counties for public defense to a single, statewide system, the Idaho Capital Sun previously reported. The transition to a new statewide system came following a 2015 ACLU of Idaho lawsuit alleging Idaho’s previous county-run public defense system violated low-income Idahoans’ Sixth Amendment right to legal counsel.  
Although the transition to a new statewide system is designed to address many of the concerns with the old system, the Sun has reported the process of moving from 44 different county systems to one statewide system has been rocky and troublesome.
Rep. Dustin Manwaring, R-Pocatello, acknowledged frustrations with the transition, but said the new funding in the budget is necessary to help get the statewide system up, running and staffed to ensure Idahoans’ right to legal representation is honored.

“We have over 1,200 cases without an assigned attorney today, and we still have an obligation to correct and fix this problem and make sure we’re not leaving clients without that representation,” Manwaring said. 
After a 25-minute debate, the Idaho House voted 51-19 to pass Senate Bill 1202.
The day before, the Idaho Senate voted 23-12 to pass Senate Bill 1202.
Having passed both legislative chambers, Senate Bill 1202 heads next to Gov. Brad Little’s desk for final consideration. Once the budget bill reaches his desk, Little will have five days to sign it into law or veto it, otherwise it will become law without his signature.
  Idaho Legislature kills other budget enhancements for state agencies 

Even though the Idaho House passed the public defense budget Tuesday, the House killed two other budgets.
On Tuesday morning the Idaho House killed Senate Bill 1192, the budget enhancements for the Idaho State Liquor Division. That budget included new funding for shrink wrap that is required under the state’s new freight contract. 
In addition, the Idaho House on Tuesday also killed Senate Bill 1193, the budget enhancements for the Office of Information Technology Services. Senate Bill 1193 included $11.1 million in additional funding for new office space, security enhancements, emergency connectivity network enhancements, IT infrastructure investments, software and IT personnel transfers. 
The Idaho House was not alone in killing budgets. On Monday, the Idaho Senate killed House Bill 450, the budget enhancements for the Idaho Department of Fish and Game. House Bill 450 included $800,000 in money from a settlement agreement with Idaho Power to help pay for restoration of wildlife habitat burned in the Valley Fire in the Boise foothills in October. 
Any of the budgets that were killed may still be rewritten before the Idaho Legislature adjourns for the year.

Tom Leek voting with Democrats against the proposal Tuesday.
Vero Beach Republican Sen. Erin Grall’s proposal (SB 1284) could let parents claim damages for the mental pain and loss of support from the fetus, which the sponsor explained means parents could be awarded for the loss of future wages that the fetus could have earned over its life.

Although the bill passed its first hearing, its future could be in peril after former Senate President Kathleen Passidomo, who chairs the powerful Rules Committee, which it must go through before reaching the Senate floor, took issue with the bill’s definition of unborn child. She questioned Grall about whether someone could file a wrongful death suit for a fetus at one week of gestation.
“To put dollar figures on something and the damages being so speculative is different than a criminal prosecution,” Passidomo said. “I’m having trouble wrapping my arms around this whole issue.”
Passidomo’s doubts are not new. The Naples Republican also expressed skepticism over Grall’s bill last year before Grall withdrew it.
During Tuesday’s Senate Judiciary Committee meeting, Democrats also bashed the bill, with Lori Berman, of Boynton Beach, calling the idea of a jury debating the potential salary of a fetus crazy, and Tina Polsky, of Boca Raton, calling it nonsensical.
“This person could be a waiter. This person could be the next Elon Musk. There is just absolutely no way to know, and it doesn’t make any sense whatsoever to try to calculate economic damages,” Polsky said.
Still, Grall defended treating a fetus the same as a day-old baby, questioning the other senators about what age would be appropriate to determine if the child would grow up to be wealthy.

How would the bill interact with Florida’s abortion landscape?

“So, at what age do we get to start to ascribe real damages to a person? At two?” Grall said. “Maybe we know how they’re doing; they’ve taken an IQ test.”
Passidomo also worried about OBGYNs leaving the state if they’re susceptible to more lawsuits.
“We’re losing OBGYNs. Who’s gonna wanna come to Florida?”
Unlike the proposal last year, SB 1284 doesn’t authorize wrongful death suits against a health care provider acting lawfully. But what lawful medical care means is too vague for Polsky, who said doctors are already hesitant to provide medically necessary abortions following the enactment of the law banning most abortions after six weeks’ gestation.
Florida’s six-week ban, which Grall sponsored, includes exceptions to save the life of the mother, fatal fetal abnormalities, and in cases of rape, incest, and human trafficking. However, doctors have spoken about the difficulties of assessing whether a case meets the exceptions, given that they can lose their medical licenses and face jail time if they provide an abortion outside the legal boundaries.
Additionally, Leek called out an amendment Grall made, switching language in the bill protecting pregnant people. He worried that the language didn’t go far enough to protect women from estranged partners. The original text stated that wrongful death action “may not be brought against the mother of the unborn child.” The bill now states that it doesn’t authorize such suits.
“My concern is more about this bill being weaponized against women who lose a child outside of abortion,” Leek said.
The House Judiciary committee is scheduled to hear the bill (HB 1517) on Wednesday in its last stop before the floor.

It was New York Sen. Chuck Schumer, the Senate’s Democratic leader, who interrupted Booker to say he had broken Thurmond’s record.
“Do you know how proud this caucus is of you? Do you know how proud America is of you?” Schumer said to applause and a standing ovation from his fellow Democrats and visitors.
Booker noted that Thurmond with his 1957 filibuster “tried to stop the rights upon which I stand.”
“I’m not here, though, because of his speech. I’m here despite his speech. I’m here because, as powerful as he was, the people were more powerful,” Booker said.

Booker’s record-breaking speech comes as the Democratic Party faces criticism from voters who say the party’s leaders are not doing enough to stand up to Trump’s actions, especially those that experts say fly in the face of legal precedent.
“These are not normal times in our nation, and they should not be treated as such in the United States Senate,” Booker said at one point. “The threats to the American people and American democracy are grave and urgent, and we all must do more to stand against them.”

“This is not right or left. It is right or wrong. This is not a partisan moment. It is a moral moment,” Booker said. “Where do you stand?”
Booker, 55, a former mayor of Newark, also assailed Trump’s policies on immigration. He said the Trump administration is doing “outrageous things like disappearing people off of American streets, violating fundamental principles of this document” — here he held up a copy of the U.S. Constitution — “invoking the Alien Enemies Act from the 1700s that was last used to put Japanese Americans into internment camps.”

Josh Shapiro visited a timber business in Reedsville to highlight his administration’s investment in agricultural companies in the commonwealth. 
Mifflin County-based Metzler Forest Products is using a state grant to increase production of biochar, used by farmers to boost soil health and crop yields. 
But Shapiro had another message as well.
Ahead of the visit, his press team touted the appearance as an effort to showcase“efforts to support Pennsylvania farmers and agricultural innovation in the face of economic uncertainty.” During his speech, Shapiro framed his administration’s investments in Pennsylvania businesses in contrast with expected tariff announcements from President Donald Trump on Wednesday.

For weeks, Shapiro, who was considered as a running mate for 2024 Democratic presidential candidate Kamala Harris, has been highlighting how Trump administration policies have impacted the state and its industries.
Last week, Shapiro announced a challenge to a Trump decision to cancel $13 million in federal funding to support Pennsylvania farmers and food banks. His office is also suing the administration over $2 billion of federal funding that was frozen early in the new administration.  Shapiro has claimed credit for getting the president to unfreeze them after he visited the White House.
“While the federal government imposes policies that hurt our economy, Pennsylvania is leading the way in driving economic growth — investing in agricultural innovation, supporting our manufacturers, and delivering real results for farmers and their families,” Shapiro said in Reedsville.
Metzler primarily sells domestically, which means they would theoretically avoid direct impacts from tariffs. And the money Metzler received was part of the Agricultural Innovation Grant program, which was created during budgets over the 2024-2025 budget, before Trump returned to office.  
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
But Shapiro noted that Pennsylvania is among the country’s leading hardwood exporters.
Since the beginning of the agricultural innovation program, roughly $2 million has gone to hardwood projects. Nate Metzler, who spoke at the event, said the company was started by his father and employs over 80 people. 
Shapiro was joined by other Pennsylvania timber and hardwood industry members who discussed the potential  impacts of Trump’s tariffs.
Nick Gilson, the CEO of Selinsgrove-based Gilson Snow, which makes skis and snowboards, voiced his concern, since they’ve shipped products to 50 countries.
He said 50% of their exports have historically gone to Canada, where boycotts of American products are growing over Trump’s trade war and threats to take over the country and make it the 51st state.
Canada has long been one of America’s staunchest allies.
“I understand the intention behind the tariffs in protecting American manufacturing, but in actual practice, on the ground level, there are adverse side effects,” Gilson said. They raise input costs, strain supply chains and make it harder for American manufacturers to compete with foreign competitors. Beyond the cold economics, I also want to recognize that these tariffs are having an impact on the perception of American made goods.”

Shapiro was also joined by Mifflin County Commissioner Kevin Kodish, Executive Director of the Keystone Wood Products Association Stephanie Phillips-Taggart, and Agriculture Secretary Russell Redding.
Following the announcement, Shapiro’s office issued a press release saying the governor will be in Northampton County Wednesday to “support Pennsylvania brewers and small businesses in the face of tariffs and economic uncertainty.”

Cory Booker started his speech on Monday at 7 p.m. and said he would continue as long as he is ""physically able."" (John Partipilo)U.S. Sen. Cory Booker on Tuesday evening neared the 24-hour mark of a marathon speech on the Senate floor that began Monday night, remarks he said are intended to protest President Donald Trump’s policies on the nation’s budget, immigration, poverty and more.
“These are not normal times in our nation, and they should not be treated as such in the United States Senate,” said Booker, 55. “The threats to the American people and American democracy are grave and urgent, and we all must do more to stand against them.”
Booker, a Democrat first elected to the Senate in 2013, on Monday said he’d continue speaking as long as he is “physically able.” After his speech surpassed 20 hours, he looked exhausted, joked about his shirt being “ripe,” and took occasional breaks by yielding the floor for questions from his Democratic colleagues, who praised the former college football player for his endurance.
His speech comes as the Democratic Party faces criticism from voters who say the party’s leaders are not doing enough to stand up to Trump’s actions, especially those that experts say fly in the face of legal precedent.
“This is not right or left. It is right or wrong. This is not a partisan moment. It is a moral moment,” Booker said early Tuesday afternoon. “Where do you stand?”
Booker’s speech is one of the longest ever given on the Senate floor. The record is held by Strom Thurmond, a South Carolina Republican who held the floor for 24 hours and 18 minutes in 1957 in protest of the Civil Rights Act. As of 4:30 p.m. — 21 hours and 30 minutes after Booker started speaking — his speech became the fourth longest ever heard in the Senate.
Booker will beat Thurmond’s record if he’s still speaking at 7:19 p.m. Tuesday.
The senator has covered a breadth of topics: health care, Social Security, Medicaid, grocery prices, free speech, veterans, public education, world leaders, Elon Musk’s Department of Government Efficiency, and national security concerns. He read letters and comments from constituents and he quoted speeches from the late Rep. John Lewis — invoking Lewis’ famous call to action to “get in good trouble” — and the late Sen. John McCain.
Booker, a former mayor of Newark, also assailed Trump’s policies on immigration. He said the Trump administration is doing “outrageous things like disappearing people off of American streets, violating fundamental principles of this document” — here he held up a copy of the U.S. Constitution — “invoking the Alien Enemies Act from the 1700s that was last used to put Japanese Americans into internment camps.”
“Do we see what’s happening?” Booker asked.
He spent about a half-hour reading the account of Jasmine Mooney, a Canadian citizen who was detained by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement for 12 days in March. He also noted that the Trump administration conceded Monday that it deported Kilmar Abrego Garcia, a 29-year-old Maryland man with protected legal status, to an El Salvador prison because of an “administrative error.”
“The government can’t walk up to a human being and grab them off the street and put them on a plane and send them to one of the most notorious prisons in the world, and just say, as one of our authorities did, ‘Oopsie,’” Booker said.
Sen. Chuck Schumer, D-New York, who asked about the impact of potential Medicaid cuts and tariffs about 15 hours into Booker’s speech, told Booker he has the support of the entire party.
“Your strength, your fortitude, your clarity has just been nothing short of amazing. All of America is paying attention to what you’re saying. All of America needs to know there’s so many problems — the disastrous actions of this administration in terms of how they’re helping only the billionaires and hurting average families — you have brought this forth with such clarity,” he said.

Few Republicans broke ranks with party leadership on those or any other proposal put forth by Democrats, leading one lawmaker to wonder out loud why the chamber was bothering with debates.
“Why take us through this dog and pony show?” said state Rep. Marlene Terry, a Democrat from Bellefontaine Neighbors.

Democrats did win a few minor changes to the budget, but the biggest difference between the plan approved in the House Budget Committee last month and the bills given first round approval Monday were made by Republican amendments. In the Medicaid program, for example, the House cut about $50 million in general revenue matches to federal funds, arguing the funds were not needed because enrollment is not meeting earlier expectations.
A final series of votes on the 13 spending bills funding state operations will be held Thursday to send the budget to the state Senate. Three more bills, allocating money to capital improvements, are awaiting action in the House Budget Committee.
While the House worked on the budget, the state Senate debated a bill exempting long-term capital gains from state income tax. Senate Appropriations Committee Chairman Lincoln Hough, a Republican from Springfield, said during debate that federal budget cuts could force Missouri to spend more state tax dollars on Medicaid.
Hough questioned whether a tax cut of about $335 million in the coming fiscal year was prudent. If the federal match rate for low-income adults added to the rolls since 2021 is changed from 90% to 80%, Hough said, it would require $300 million in additional general revenue.
 “That is a fairly scary financial forecast,” Hough said.
Hough has said he intends to use cash balances to fully fund the foundation formula and that he will support the increase for child care providers. 
The possibility of cuts in national spending — federal funds provide about 45% of Missouri’s budget — was also raised in the House.
“Our entire budget will be blown to bits if we lose federal funding,” said state Rep. Stephanie Hein, a Democrat from Springfield.
The state had a substantial balance of $3.8 billion in the general revenue fund as of Monday, down from historic high of about $5.7 billion set in 2023. The budget for the coming year anticipates leaving about $1.9 billion unspent.
Missouri received $13.4 billion in general revenue in the year that ended June 30 and the budget anticipates $13.5 billion for the coming fiscal year. 
The budget plan debated by the House cuts almost $800 million in general revenue and $2.1 billion overall less than the operating budget proposed by Gov. Mike Kehoe in January. The spending proposal achieves those savings in part by cutting appropriations that had no funding available, by reducing Medicaid to match expected enrollment and by slicing Kehoe’s plan for state employee pay raises in half.
Instead of a raise of 1% for every two years in a state job, capped at 10%, the House pay plan is to provide a raise of 1% for every two years in a state job but capped at 5%.
Additions to the budget proposed by Kehoe include 105 earmarked items, including nine added Monday, with a total cost of $170 million. The House also added $28 million that will be distributed to state colleges and universities for deferred building maintenance.
The two biggest clashes of the day bookended the five-hour debate.
Only one Republican joined Democrats on a failed amendment to shift $50 million in general revenue from a tax credit program supporting private school tuition scholarships to the foundation formula. 
Democrats argued that the budget shortchanges public schools by failing to meet the new state adequacy target, which is a measure of how much high-performing districts spend per student. The House plan allows for a state adequacy target of $6,760 per student instead of the $7,145 that resulted from the calculation mandated by state law. 
To boost foundation formula funding, state Rep. Betsy Fogle, a Springfield Democrat, tried to strip out $50 million for the MOScholars program, which was supposed to be funded by donations tied to tax credits.
Too many of the private schools participating in the scholarship program won’t accept students with developmental disabilities or who won’t participate in religious instruction, Fogle said. 
“I can’t think of anything more frustrating to me, personally, than my tax dollars going to a school that wouldn’t have educated me, that wouldn’t have educated a lot of people in this body,” she said.
Defending the set-aside for the scholarship program, Republicans said the influx of state cash will help hundreds more students.
“This is a historic investment in our children’s future, fostering flexibility around parental involvement and educational freedom for our kids,” said state Rep. Ben Baker, a Republican from Neosho.
While the budget plan accepted Kehoe’s proposal for scholarships, it did not include his $107 million plan for child care subsidies. The system for delivering payments has been plagued by mistakes and delays and some providers have closed as a result.
Hein sought to restore about $85 million of the cut.
“We have the opportunity to fix the situation and bring the state into compliance with federal rules,” Hein said. “We can stabilize the child care industry and help our workforce.”
Republicans, however, said the expense will have to be paid from general revenue in the future and it is too costly. The problems with the payment system are solved, said House Budget Committee Chairman Dirk Deaton, a Republican from Noel, and a change now could cause problems to resurface.
“Changing how you pay providers from attendance to enrollment is not just flipping a switch over at the Department of Elementary Secondary Education,” he said. “There are substantial software changes that have to be made.”

Brad Little vetoed a bill that would’ve banned medical intervention mandates — including vaccines, medical treatment or medicine — by businesses, governments, schools and colleges, the Idaho Legislature’s immediate path forward to respond remains unclear.
The governor vetoed the bill Saturday. 
On Monday, the Idaho Senate introduced a new tweaked version of the bill. On Tuesday, the Idaho House made a similar move. 
But the Senate has not officially attempted to override the governor’s veto; the original bill narrowly passed the Senate and would need broader support to pass a veto override, which requires two-thirds support in each legislative chamber.

Senate President Pro Tempore Kelly Anthon, R-Rupert, hasn’t ruled out a vote to override the governor’s veto on the bill, he told the Idaho Capital Sun in an interview on the Senate floor Tuesday afternoon. But first, he said, lawmakers are focused on working with the governor “to come up with language that is doable.”
Asked if the Senate would override the governor’s veto, Anthon told the Sun “It very well could happen. But until we know that the road … is completely at a dead end, you won’t see that happen. I think you’re going to first see, ‘Can we work with the governor to come up with language that is doable?’ But you may not want to play that card or give up that leverage until you know you can’t work out a deal.”

 Revised legislation surfaces in both the Idaho House and Senate

The Senate’s revised bill, Senate Bill 1210, exempts day cares and adds language specifying the school medical mandate ban provision is subject to various other Idaho laws that let school boards block sick students from attending, spell out parental rights, and more. The House’s revised bill, House Bill 472, adds language specifying that the bill wouldn’t overrule existing powers of school districts, or school board trustees — as already granted in Idaho law.
To become law, Idaho bills must pass the House and Senate, and avoid the governor’s veto.
Right now, the Legislature is in the middle of a negotiation, Anthon told the Sun, and he doubts the new bills will become law as drafted.
“I personally think that none of those bills, as printed, will end up becoming law,” he said.
The new bills appear to be competing versions of revised bills that attempt to address the governor’s concerns over the original vetoed bill.

Explaining his veto of the original bill, Senate Bill 1023, Little said he valued medical freedom but worried that the bill “removes parents’ freedom to ensure their children stay healthy at school because it jeopardizes the ability of schools to send home sick students with highly contagious conditions,” including measles. 
The Idaho governor’s office couldn’t be immediately reached for comment about how much either bill addresses Little’s concerns over the original bill, called the Idaho Medical Freedom Act.
“Once the bill got vetoed … we start down a road where we try to figure out ‘What’s a bill that can actually pass both Houses?” Anthon told the Sun. “And so you start to see the clamor of legislation.”
The Idaho Legislature is more than a week past Republican leadership’s nonbinding goal to adjourn, or end, this year’s legislative session on March 21 — largely due to budgeting delays by the Legislature’s powerful budget committee, the Sun previously reported. 
  Senate revised bill pulled last minute from committee agenda

On Tuesday afternoon, the revised Senate bill was scheduled to be considered in the Senate State Affairs Committee, where it could’ve been advanced to the full Senate for a vote. But the meeting was canceled.

Sen. Dan Foreman, R-Moscow, cosponsored the original bill that the governor vetoed and the revised Senate bill. He declined to comment on the bill’s future to the Sun on Tuesday. 
Senate State Affairs Committee Chairman Jim Guthrie, R-McCammon, told the Sun in a Tuesday interview that Foreman had asked him to remove the bill from the committee’s agenda. But Guthrie said he didn’t know Foreman’s reasons.
Anthon, the top Senate Republican, told the Sun that Foreman “is working really, really hard to get a policy across the finish line that effectuates, at the end of the day, the goal — and the goal is to get that medical freedom piece in place.”
“How to fine tune that language to get all of the different players happy is very difficult. So there’s a negotiation taking place,” Anthon said. “Sometimes you have to throw out a piece of legislation to get people to the table. So Senator Forman has done that. It looks like the House has done that a couple of times now. And once that piece of legislation is printed, the dialog starts. So I think we’re just in the middle of a process.”

 Idaho AG, who lost a challenge to Gov. Little, urged Legislature to override veto

Idaho Attorney General Raúl Labrador on Monday urged the Idaho Legislature to override the governor’s veto, calling the bill “the defining bill of this session.”
“Five years ago, COVID-19 brought chaos: lockdowns, mandates, business closures, school shutdowns, and restrictions that crushed our freedom,” Labrador said in a prepared statement. “In hindsight, the damage to our society, children, and economy was far worse than the virus itself. I ran for Attorney General because our State failed to protect our citizens from government overreach. The legislature now has the opportunity to do the right thing.”
Labrador is a former U.S. House of Representatives member. In 2018, he lost a Republican primary governor’s election challenge to Little. In 2022, Labrador was elected as Idaho attorney general. 
Idaho Freedom Action, the lobbying arm of the Idaho Freedom Foundation, also supported a legislative veto override. Before Little vetoed the bill, Idaho Republican Party Chairwoman Dorothy Moon urged people to ask Little to sign the bill.
 How the bill works: Banning medical intervention mandates — beyond vaccines

Both bills introduced this week modify a bill that previously passed the Legislature, and was vetoed by Little. 
The original bill would have banned businesses and any Idaho governments — local, county or state — from requiring medical interventions for employment, admission to venues, transportation, or providing products or services. 
The bill would’ve also extended to schools in Idaho — private or public — and colleges, universities and trade schools, blocking them from requiring medical interventions for school attendance, employment, or entrance into campus or school buildings.

The new broader medical intervention requirement ban the governor vetoed would have expanded on a previous Idaho law banning COVID vaccine requirements, which Little signed in 2023, despite its similarities to one he vetoed a year earlier, the Idaho Statesman reported.
This year’s broader bill — amended twice — was cosponsored by Sen. Foreman and Rep. Robert Beiswenger, R-Horseshoe Bend. Health Freedom Defense Fund President and Founder Leslie Manookian wrote the bill. 
Under the bill, medical interventions include “a procedure, treatment, device, drug injection, medication, or action taken to diagnose, prevent, or cure a disease or alter the health or biological function of a person.” 
Business medical intervention mandates for employment would still be allowed in a few excepted circumstances, including in certain federal travel scenarios if jobs require entry into facilities that require medical interventions, or if required by federal law. 
The bill would also exempt medical intervention bans in situations where employers require “personal protection equipment, items, or clothing … based on existing traditional and accepted industry standards or federal law.” But the bill says COVID-era requirements, such as for masks or vaccines, are not exempt from the ban.
The bill would allow the Idaho attorney general or county prosecuting attorneys to enforce the law through injunctive relief, which are essentially civil court actions issued in lawsuits.

(Nathaniel Bailey for the Daily Montanan)As the Senate chamber emptied on Tuesday afternoon, a sergeant-at-arms cleared off the desk of Sen. Jason Ellsworth. 
The Montana Senate voted 44-6 to punish the Hamilton Republican, for his failure to disclose a conflict of interest in procuring a contract for a close friend, and for a “pattern of abuse.”
In making the motion, Senate Majority Leader Tom McGillvray, R-Billings, said the punishment was for more than just the conflict of interest which was the focus of a Senate Ethics Committee. He said it encompassed years of wrongdoings by Ellsworth, including running afoul of the Federal Trade Commission more than a decade ago, two altercations with law enforcement, and the work done late last year to a $170,100 contract that skirted procurement rules. 
“I think this is appropriate,” McGillvray told his colleagues on the floor. “These incidents were very, very serious and the Senate should respond accordingly.” 
Ellsworth, who apologized for only an appearance of impropriety, voted remotely against his own censure. He did not respond to texts or phone calls about his censure. 
Last week, the Senate voted twice on motions to expel Ellsworth, but couldn’t get to the 2/3 majority (34 votes) needed to punish or expel a member, as a majority of Democrats voted against expulsion. Another expulsion vote taken before the censure also failed. 
Negotiations between McGillvray and Senate President Matt Regier, R-Kalispell, and Minority Leader Pat Flowers, D-Belgrade, took place over the last week, up until Tuesday when McGillvray said he crafted the final language that went “right up to” the line of expulsion. 
The censure includes the following:

Removal from Senate standing committees
No assignment to interim committees
No verbal contact with executive branch directors or legislative staff, unless Ellsworth is first contacted by them. 
Revocation of access to legislator or legislative services office space
Revocation of floor privileges for life

For the remainder of the session, all Ellsworth can do in an official capacity is vote, remotely, on second and third readings of bills, and on motions made on the floor. Former legislators are allowed floor access after they serve, but Ellsworth will not be allowed to enter the Senate chamber again.

Regier told reporters after the vote that he remained disappointed that the chamber was unable to muster the votes to expel Ellsworth, casting blame on the minority caucus. 
“This is everything that the public of Montana does not like about politicians, and we didn’t expel that from the system,” Regier said. “I’m still for (expulsion), still disappointed that the Democrat party didn’t stand up and get rid of corruption. But I am glad, as a conciliatory action, that action was taken and there was repercussions.”
McGillvray added he felt the Democrats likely prevented the expulsion of Ellsworth to secure a vote on legislation. 
“Democrats don’t protect corrupt Republicans out of principle,” he said.
Six members voted against the censure, including two Democrats — Sen. Ellie Boldman and Sen. Jonathan Windy Boy. Two Great Falls Republicans Sens. Jeremy Trebas and Daniel Emrich had voted for expulsion but not for the censure, and Wendy McKamey, also of Great Falls, voted against the censure. 
Both Democrats spoke on the floor about their reasons for resisting the motion. Windy Boy said he thought there should be a progressive warning system before a punishment was enacted, while Boldman said she still doubted the fairness of the entire process and felt that revoking floor privileges for life went too far. 
“The political witch hunt needs to stop,” she said. 
Many members of the Republican majority, however, still favored expulsion. 
Sen. Forrest Mandeville, R-Columbus, who led the Senate Ethics Committee, made a substitute motion to expel Ellsworth, which failed on a tie vote. 
“I don’t see what has changed in the last week that would change my mind that expulsion is the most appropriate punishment,” he said. “I feel the infractions of the Senator from Senate District 43 has made over the course of his service in the Senate makes him unsuitable for office.” 
Sen. Chris Pope, a Bozeman Democrat, also served on the Ethics Committee and again made his case that censure was the best route and would be a “very black mark” on Ellsworth. 
“I think there’s a sense in this body that our colleague has really fallen and that there needs to be consequences,” Pope said. “We also, as a body, I think, have been interested in being judicious and being fair, but being very explicit as to what the punishment and what the long term need is here for this body to express itself, and its commitment to transparency and integrity and decorum.”
Flowers said he felt the censure was fair, even though it went further than what his party had initially proposed — including the revocation of floor privileges and speaking to legislative staff — and for the most part his caucus had been happy with where things ended up. 
“I applaud the Ethics Committee for being as efficient as possible with that effort and fair, but it did take a lot of time and energy, and I think just brought a kind of a little bit of a pall on our proceedings in here,” Flowers said. “I think all of us are ready and happy to be moving on.”

(Photo by Austin Fisher / Source NM)The New Mexico Foundation for Open Government on Tuesday filed a lawsuit against the state Corrections Department for violations of New Mexico’s public records law.
In the suit, the Albuquerque-based nonprofit NMFOG alleges both specific and ongoing violations by NMCD of the Inspection of Public Records Act, citing at least nine successful lawsuits against the agency resulting in $365,000 worth of damages and fees paid by the state.
But it’s not your typical lawsuit trying to get a court to force a government agency to fork over some records — NMFOG wants a judge to declare that the Corrections Department must respect the public’s right to inspect records now and in the future.
The suit stems from FOG’s IPRA request in 2024 for three years’ worth of NMCD financial records showing settlement amounts paid out after IPRA lawsuits. The department denied that request. 
The new suit asks the court to require the agency to produce those records, and to explain which records it withheld in another request. 
Moreover, the organization is asking the court to issue an order requiring Corrections to comply with the state law going forward and alleges the department “has a history, practice and pattern of failing to comply” with IPRA and continues to do so despite losing in court time and time again. 
The complaint details legal settlements paid using public funds by the department in response to IPRA suits brought over the last three years by the American Civil Liberties Union of New Mexico, Disability Rights New Mexico and a formerly incarcerated person.
In an email to Source NM on Tuesday afternoon, Corrections Department Spokesperson Brittany Roembach declined to comment on pending litigation.
‘Tip of the iceberg’
The complaint describes the prior lawsuits it cites as “the tip of the iceberg of the actual number of successful IPRA enforcement actions against” the department, and does not capture all of its IPRA violations.
Indeed, the New Mexico Prison and Jail Project has filed four other lawsuits against the department in the last five years over allegations of withholding records based on internal policies or withholding records until sued, according to court records.
NMFOG says in the complaint an injunction “is the only adequate remedy,” because requiring them to pay money for violating the law won’t stop them from doing it in the future.
NMFOG also points out that the New Mexico Court of Appeals ruled last May in a suit by the ACLU-NM seeking documents about the department’s use of force policies, that the department’s policies or rules “cannot be used to exempt public records from inspection under IPRA.”
That ruling “has also failed to deter Defendant NMCD from persisting in hiding behind its internal rules to unlawfully shield public records,” the complaint states.
The department appealed the ruling to the New Mexico Supreme Court, which on Sept. 6, 2024 agreed to hear the case, according to court records. The case has not yet been scheduled for argument at the Supreme Court.
In the complaint, NMFOG insists that the appeals court ruling is still good law, even though the Supreme Court has agreed to review it, because the Supreme Court hasn’t nullified the lower court’s ruling in any way.",https://sourcenm.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/IMG_6820-scaled-e1657153109251-1024x627.jpg,,,2025-04-01 19:06:08.951121

Cathy Tinney-Zara, president of the American Federation of Government Employees Local 3040, said she’d received word that all 185 bargaining unit employees will be part of a reduction in force. In addition, management officials at the office have been put on administrative leave and will be part of the reduction in force, she said. 
She estimates that altogether, 210 staff positions have been eliminated.
“It’s devastating. People will die,” Tinney-Zara said of the effects of the cuts. Officials at the facility were told the cuts were because the services there were not needed or were duplicative, she said. 
“There is no one else in the government that does occupational safety and health,” she said. “There’s no one else in the U.S. We’re the only group, NIOSH, that does occupational safety and health. We do the research to make everyone’s job safer.”
According to the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, the Centers for Disease Control, which oversees NIOSH, will decrease its workforce by 2,400, in accordance with President Donald Trump’s ‘Department of Government Efficiency’ Workforce Optimization Initiative.” 
Overall, the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services will reduce staffing from 82,000 to 62,000 and consolidate 28 divisions into 15. Staffing cuts are expected to save $1.8 billion per year. 
The changes will improve Americans’ experience with the agency by making it more responsive and efficient, while ensuring that Medicare, Medicaid, and other essential health services remain intact, the organization said in a statement. 
“Over time, bureaucracies like HHS become wasteful and inefficient even when most of their staff are dedicated and competent civil servants,” Secretary Robert F. Kennedy said in the statement. “This overhaul will be a win-win for taxpayers and for those that HHS serves. That’s the entire American public, because our goal is to Make America Healthy Again.”
The Morgantown facility had 674 mice and 37 rats for use in studies that will likely be destroyed, Tinney-Zara said. Law requires the facility to have a veterinarian when working with the animals. The veterinarian was let go, she said. Some of the studies have been going on for decades, but are being ended.
“All of our animals, it appears, will have to be euthanized,” Tinney-Zara said. “And to make matters worse, there was a shipment of animals that came in today that the CDC DOGE person approved the purchase of these animals. They just came into the facility. They’re going to have to be euthanized.”
Tinney-Zara spoke with West Virginia Watch Tuesday afternoon as she cleaned out her office of more than 30 years. She said she received notice around 5 a.m. Tuesday that she was being fired and that she’d lose access to the facility by midnight. 
“Everyone’s running around here with tears in their eyes and yeah, it’s just been an insane day,” she said. 
An original notice last week listed administrative roles that were to be affected. 
“Then, all of a sudden it was our whole entire facility,” she said. 
Tinney-Zara said the Morgantown cuts will have a far-reaching effect on the economy in the city and the rest of the state. 
“Let’s see, take approximately 210 people that many of them have Ph.D.s and are scientists, and have years of experience and new researchers coming on board and take them out of the market, take all of their tax dollars, and it will have a drastic economic impact,” she said. “And that can be both local and statewide.”

(Photo by Jay Waagmeester/Florida Phoenix)An election measure raising citizenship-related roadblocks to voter eligibility won approval in a Florida House committee on Tuesday, but not before receiving criticism from members of he public — some who thought it is far too restrictive, and others who thought it isn’t tough enough.
Fort Myers Republican Jenna Persons-Mulicka presented her bill (HB 1381) before the House Government Operations Subcommittee. It now has two more stops before going to the floor.
A variety of bills in the Senate carry some of its provisions, although perhaps the most similar, proposed by GOP Sen. Blaise Ingoglia (SB 1414), has yet to be heard in any committee.
Persons-Mulicka noted that her measure is in part a response to the executive order published last week by President Donald Trump that would require prospective voters to show proof of U.S. citizenship to register to vote.
“This bill fully answers the president,” she said.
The measure contains numerous provisions ostensibly to ensure that only U.S. citizens vote. It says that if an applicant has not provided the necessary evidence of their legal status, or is not verified before the applicant requests a vote-by-mail ballot or presents to vote, the applicant must be provided a provisional ballot that can be counted only if they confirm their legal status by 5 p.m. on the Thursday after a Tuesday election.
The bill also says that a supervisor of elections must remove the name of a deceased voter from the voter rolls within seven days if they receive a copy of a death certificate or a published obituary or notice of death, a letter of probate or estate administration, or “personal knowledge” of a registered voter’s death.
Other provisions include:

The state’s division of elections office can use lists from federal agencies or other state governments to remove voters from the rolls.
It requires jury coordinators for federal jury duty to create a list of those disqualified for not being U.S. citizens and to provide it to the Florida Division of Elections according to the jury summons cycle used by the court clerk.
Eliminates certain categories of voter identification options such as student identification, debit or credit cards, and retirement cards.
Changes from “challenge” to “protest” voter challenges of vote-by-mail ballots.
In a manual review of ballots open to the public, the bill says that each political party may designate one person with “expertise in the computer field” who must be allowed in the central counting room where all tests are being conducted and where the official votes are being counted.
Requires all voting to be by paper ballot, unless a person with a disability requires a voter-interface device.
Would make Florida first state in the nation to require an automated, independent vote validation process for every ballot cast in every election before certification.

Cathi Chamberlain, who works with “voting integrity” advocates skeptical of election security, complained the proposal “does not go far enough,” preferring a bill presented by Pinellas Republican Rep. Berny Jacques.
“We believe it still does not fully align with President Trump’s executive order,” she said. “It does not remove and prosecute noncitizens already on our voting rolls. It does not address vote by mail or technology security.”
Jonathan Webber, policy director with the Southern Poverty Law Center, said the measure was a voter suppression bill.
“Millions of our family members, friends, and neighbors lived through Jim Crow,” he said. “Poll taxes, literacy tests, and intimidation used to silence Black voters across the Deep South. Not because they weren’t citizens, but because the system was built to block their voices. This amendment continues that legacy, just with cleaner language and more paperwork.”
Praise
Karen Jaroch of Heritage Action called it an “excellent bill.”
“The amended bill 1381 delivers targeted reforms that rebuild voter trust,” she said. “Voter roll accuracy is also important. Section 6 authorizes data sharing with other states to purge deceased or ineligible voters. And Section 8 leverages federal jury data to flag ineligible voters. That’s smart practical reforms to protect every lawful vote.”
Pasco County Republican Rep. Jeff Holcomb argued the proposal is necessary. “The threat is real because of illegals voting,” he said.
Broward County Democratic Rep. Darryl Campbell disagreed, saying the measure wasn’t about fraud, but about fear.
Orlando Democratic Rep. LaVon Bracy later attempted to introduce an amendment that would essentially wipe out Persons-Mulicka’s bill and insert her own proposal (HB 1409), which included automatic registration for eligible Floridians to vote when they interact with the Department of Highway Safety and Motor Vehicles (DHSMV), unless they opt-out.
Her amendment also included a centralized database for returning citizens to determine voter eligibility; permanent vote-by-mail requests; and would allow eligible voters to register to vote at any time, up to and including Election Day.
The committee voted down her amendment along party lines.

The new cases impacted a very young child, one school-aged child and two adults, according to the state’s website. New Mexico’s current cases include 25 adults, 14 children aged 5 to 17 and nine very young children ages 0 to 4-years old, mostly in unvaccinated people.
Measles cases in Eddy County remain unchanged at two, with the remaining 46 cases in Lea County.
“Measles is highly contagious, and our department continues to keep the public educated about the spread, which is still confined to the southeast portion of our state,” New Mexico Department of Health Communications Director Robert Nott told Source NM.  “But we must remain vigilant about any case count increase related to the outbreak. We are continually encouraging New Mexicans to get the MMR vaccination – their best protection from the virus.”
NMDOH vaccinated more than 14,800 New Mexicans between Feb. 1 and March 31, Nott said.
Measles, a highly contagious respiratory virus, spreads through contact with airborne droplets from an infected person’s coughs and sneezes, which hang in the air for hours. Symptoms often take weeks to develop, and people can spread the virus days before showing a fever, cough, red eyes or the spotty red rash. Severe complications can occur with a measles infection, including brain swelling, blindness, pneumonia and death. About one in five cases merits hospitalization, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
State officials warned last month that a Texas traveler in early March exposed people in Valencia and Guadalupe counties. Nott told Source NM the department has no updates since that alert.
Texas on Tuesday reported 22 more cases since Friday, bringing its total to 422 cases since early January; more than 66% of the cases are in Gaines County, Texas, where the outbreak first began.
The deaths earlier this year of a 6-year old Texas child, and a Lea County adult, both unvaccinated, were the first measles deaths in the U.S. in a decade.
Vaccine records can be found at the Vax View website or by calling the NMDOH immunization program at 1-833-882-6454, available weekdays from 8 a.m. to 5 p.m.
Measles and misinformation
The measles outbreak, which now includes cases in more than 20 states, has been marked by tension over the federal Health and Human Services Department’s lack of a full-throated vaccination campaign, a departure from the traditional response from the country’s largest public health agency, including the 1989 outbreak.
HHS Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., who founded the anti-vaccine nonprofit Children’s Health Defense, has instead called vaccines a “personal choice.” In February, the entire New Mexico congressional delegation called upon Kennedy to take stronger action against the outbreak.
Just last week, the top vaccine scientist at the Food and Drug Administration resigned, criticizing Kennedy for “lies and misinformation” around vaccines.
Dr. Peter Marks, who played a key role in the swift development and deployment of the COVID-19 vaccine, wrote in his March 28 resignation letter that the ongoing multistate measles outbreak had resulted from public officials undermining “confidence in well-established science underlying public health and well-being.”
In interviews, Kennedy has also endorsed unproven treatments, which, if misused, could have lasting harms, doctors told Source NM. For instance, in a March 4 interview with Fox News, Kennedy said there were “very, very good results” from treating the illness with steroids, antibiotics and cod liver oil, which is high in Vitamins A and D.
Pediatrician Dr. Melissa Mason told Source NM that steroids and antibiotics may be used to treat complications from severe cases of measles — such as severe inflammation or secondary ear or lung infections — but they do not treat measles itself.
“People unnecessarily using steroids and antibiotics can actually cause harm — that should really only be done under close supervision of a physician,” she said.
Two doses of the vaccine remains the only safe and effective prevention against measles, said Mason, who chairs the immunization committee for the New Mexico Pediatric Society.
Mason’s other concern is that misinformation about Vitamin A, which is used for treating serious cases of measles, is being falsely touted by anti-vaccine advocates as prevention. Vitamin A — unlike other vitamins — can cause liver damage in too high of doses, Mason said.
“In serious cases, the measles virus depletes the body’s supply of Vitamin A,” she said. “Only for hospitalized patients under the care of a physician, if it is shown that they are low in vitamin A, only then is it appropriate to treat with vitamin A.”
The New York Times reported that doctors in Gaines County, Texas, are treating children with measles with liver damage from taking too much Vitamin A outside of doctor’s orders.
No such cases have been reported in Lea or Eddy counties, according to data from the New Mexico Poison and Drug Information Center at the University of New Mexico. Mason said  anti-vaccine misinformation preys on people who are concerned for their children.
“I think people are scared and, when they’re scared, they’re looking for anything that they can use or try to stay healthy and safe,” she said. “But you need to be careful and cautious with things that you were trying to use to be healthy and safe and actually use things that are proven.”

(Reena Rose Sibayan for New Jersey Monitor)The case of a Columbia University activist who is facing deportation because of his pro-Palestinian protests on the school’s campus will remain in New Jersey, a federal judge ruled Tuesday.
U.S. District Court Judge Michael Farbiarz rejected a push by federal prosecutors to move the case to Louisiana, where the activist, Mahmoud Khalil, has been detained since soon after immigration agents arrested him March 8. Farbiarz said New Jersey’s federal courts have jurisdiction over Khalil’s case because he was detained in Elizabeth at the time his lawyer filed his plea for release.
“This case, as filed on March 9 at 4:40 am, can go forward in New Jersey because that is where the Petitioner was confined at that moment,” Farbiarz wrote in the 67-page ruling.
Khalil, a legal permanent resident married to a U.S. citizen, faces no criminal charge. His case has garnered national attention as the government attempts to revoke his green card status, saying his anti-Israel protests amount to support for terrorist group Hamas.
Appearing in Farbiarz’s Newark courtroom on Friday, attorneys for the Trump administration argued that federal courts in Louisiana were the proper jurisdiction for Khalil’s case because that’s where he is detained. Kahlil’s legal team said prosecutors were hoping to get Khalil’s case before a judge who would be friendlier to their side, commonly referred to as forum shopping.
Farbiarz in Tuesday’s decision said court rules channel certain cases to particular courts, partly to limit forum shopping.
“The Petitioner was in custody in New Jersey as of March 9 at 4:40 am,” Farbiarz wrote. “And under a federal statute, the Petition, though filed in New York, must be treated as having been filed in New Jersey on March 9 at 4:40 am. Therefore, this Court has jurisdiction.”
Baher Azmy, one of Khalil’s attorneys, said the legal team is grateful the court “understood that the government cannot try to manipulate the jurisdiction of the United States courts in a transparent attempt to shield their unconstitutional – and frankly chilling – behavior.”
The next step in Khalil’s case is to get him out of detention, Azmy said.
Khalil’s wife, Noor Abdalla, who is nine months pregnant and expecting to give birth this month, said in a statement that she is “relieved” at the court’s decision.
“This is an important step towards securing Mahmoud’s freedom, but there is still a lot more to be done. As the countdown to our son’s birth begins and I inch closer and closer to my due date, I will continue to strongly advocate for Mahmoud’s freedom and for his safe return home so he can be by my side to welcome our first child,” she said.

(Photo by Robin Opsahl/Iowa Capital Dispatch)An Iowa Senate subcommittee advanced legislation Tuesday to ban DEI offices and officers in certain public and private entities while noting there are proposed changes in the bill still to come.
House File 856 would bar state entities, including universities and community colleges as well as private universities, from spending any funds, public or private, on diversity, equity and inclusion offices or officers, with some exceptions. If found to be noncompliant with the law, private universities would become ineligible for the Iowa Tuition Grant program until they make changes — meaning students who receive Iowa Tuition Grant dollars would not be able to spend them at the offending universities.
The section of the bill pertaining to private universities was the main topic of discussion for members of the public, both in opposition and support. It was also the section that subcommittee chairman Sen. Ken Rozenboom, R-Oskaloosa, told those gathered he would be submitting an amendment to remove.
In the Iowa Tuition Grant’s more than 50-year history, Rozenboom said the Legislature has never added conditions to the program, and if it starts now, more conditions will added later.
“I’m very uncomfortable, personally … with dipping our toe into conditioning the Iowa Tuition Grant,” Rozenboom said.

He and Sen. Tim Kraayenbrink, R-Fort Dodge, signed off on the legislation, with Sen. Herman Quirmbach, D-Ames, abstaining.
Patty Alexander, who identified herself as a “concerned mom,” was joined by other parents and lobbyists in support of the legislation. Inspired Life lobbyist Amber Williams said the bill will stop division sowed by DEI policies and activities and protects students from being judged by their demographics rather than their efforts and merit.
“I support this bill because it will hold higher learning institutions accountable and allow them to make corrections, and will ensure that the unhealthy and misguided pursuit of power, which DEI supports, will not be tolerated,” Alexander said.
Interfaith Alliance of Iowa lobbyist and Executive Director Connie Ryan opposed the bill and said DEI is about both acknowledging past disparities between different groups and their effects, and also about setting up every Iowan for support and success in the future.
The concepts of DEI are key to ensuring members of Iowa’s institutions, educational or not, are provided opportunities without erecting barriers, she said.
“That’s the goal of diversity, equity and inclusion. It should be the goal of Iowa’s elected officials,” Ryan said. “We are grateful that you took out private institutions. We hope that you would take out the rest of the language as well.”
Iowa Board of Regents State Relations Officer Jillian Carlson said the board is registered as “undecided” on the bill, but it is “generally supportive” of moving away from DEI, as is happening on the federal level.
With other legislation targeting DEI moving through the Statehouse, Carlson said the board would appreciate lawmakers aligning the varying definitions of DEI included in different bills, which Quirmbach and Rozenboom acknowledged.
Quirmbach said he was happy to hear of Rozenboom’s intentions to remove private universities from the bill, but said he wished community colleges and public universities were also included in the proposed amendment.
Echoing comments he made during debate of Senate File 507, which would bar local governments from utilizing DEI practices, Quirmbach said the ideas making up DEI are an asset to organizations wanting to ensure they have the best people and training for the job.
“In general, looking for people of high merit, you want to have the broadest possible pool of candidates,” Quirmbach said. “The bigger the pool, the more likely you’re going to find somebody who is absolutely, spectacularly wonderful. But there are certain groups that aren’t typically recruited.”
One acronym brought up by supporters of the bill was MEI — or merit, excellence and intelligence. Rozenboom said the tenets of MEI have been replaced over the years with DEI, with negative consequences.
Both he and Kraayenbrink said the public signaled its wish to do away with DEI in the last election, and this legislation will help clean up the mess.
“MEI resonates with me a lot more than DEI does, and I hope that’s the direction we can head from now on,” Rozenboom said.

(Photo by Emma Murphy/Oklahoma Voice)OKLAHOMA CITY – The state’s mental health commissioner on Tuesday said the agency is dealing with a $43 million shortfall, which some say has resulted in cuts to providers.
Commissioner Allie Friesen spoke with providers who contract with the Oklahoma State Department of Mental Health and Substance Abuse Services during  an emotional meeting. . 
Officials originally believed the shortfall was $63.7 million, she told providers who expressed frustration with the sudden cuts.
“So, the $43 million is the number,” Friesen said during the meeting. “It’s a fun, super fun dance to try to manage the Legislature and the executive branch. They hate each other, and I can’t win.”
She said she doesn’t have the tolerance for politics getting in the way of patient care.
“If we can remove the political egos from the situation and focus on those that need our care, then we’ll get it figured out,” Friesen said. “So that’s what I am going to be advocating for, and that might mean I get fired.”
A spokesperson for the agency, Kelsey Davis, later said the exact amount of the shortfall is under investigation.
Gov. Kevin Stitt’s office did not respond to a request for comment.
Friesen, who was appointed by Stitt in January 2024, said the agency will likely ask for a larger budget request for fiscal year 2026 than it has ever had, but it is unlikely it will get it.
Oklahoma Voice also asked the agency for more specifics about the cuts following the meeting.
“At this time, no payments have been cancelled,” Friesen said in a statement. “An email was sent to providers regarding potential changes to value-based payments, but we continue to evaluate the best path forward.”
Janet Cizek is CEO of Community Treatment Integrations with offices in Tulsa and Bartlesville and attended the meeting. Her organization specializes in treating substance abuse disorders and cares for about 8,000 clients a year.
It received value-based payments for good outcomes, such as a client’s sobriety or maintaining employment. Value-based care payments reward providers who give high-quality care that improve health care outcomes.
On March 18, Cizek said providers received an email saying the contract had been terminated retroactively to Oct.1, meaning no reimbursement for some services already provided. Without the services, some may go to jail and others may die, she said.
“Claiming that no contracts have been cut is disingenuous at best,” she said.
Last month, Stitt called for an audit of the agency after Friesen brought the financial issues to his attention.
Legislative leaders said the Legislative Office of Fiscal Transparency will determine why the “unacceptable shortfall exists, in its breadth, and how to prevent it from ever occurring again.”
Last month, Stitt said the agency’s chief financial officer had been replaced.
Richard Edwards, former chief financial officer, said he resigned under the threat of termination.
In a letter to lawmakers provided to Oklahoma Voice, Edwards wrote that he was “taken aback” by Friesen’s allegations and denied any wrongdoing. He offered to cooperate with the investigation.
Edwards said Tuesday he was a “convenient scapegoat,” for the current leadership, which continues to blame prior leaders for the financial situation.
Some of the problems the agency is having are related to Friesen’s leadership, Edwards said.
A number of high-level staff, chiefs or deputies were brought in under her tenure, he said.
The agency also purchased furniture, vehicles and other items that contributed to the financial problems, although in a relatively small way, he said.
Davis, the mental health spokesperson, said it would not be appropriate to comment on remarks from a former employee.
House Appropriations and Budget Committee Chairman Trey Caldwell, R-Faxon, said the agency’s past administration had been paying prior year bills with new money, and it caught up with them.
He said a supplemental appropriation is possible, but lawmakers need a firm number from the executive branch. 
The shortfall figure keeps changing, he said.
Meanwhile, the agency has asked the Oklahoma Legislature for another $124 million to cover overrun costs for the construction of a new inpatient mental health hospital, the Donahue Behavioral Health Campus in Oklahoma City.
It is intended to replace the Griffin Memorial Hospital in Norman.

The bill passed the House 88-12 on Tuesday and now heads to the Senate for consideration. (Perry Bennett | West Virginia Legislative Photography)The West Virginia House approved a priority bill pushed by Gov. Patrick Morrisey on Tuesday that is meant to incentivize the creation of microgrids and data centers in the state.
Members of the House voted 88-12 in support of House Bill 2014. Republican Dels. Marty Gearheart, R-Mercer; Bill Flanigan, R-Ohio and Jordan Bridges, R-Logan, joined the chamber’s nine Democrats in voting against it. The bill now heads to the Senate for introduction and consideration.
The bill’s passage in the House came one day before a deadline that requires all bills to be passed out of their chamber of origin in order for them to be considered by the other chamber and sent to the governor’s desk by the final night of session on April 12.
HB 2014 — dubbed as the Power Generation and Consumption Act — will allow companies seeking to build data centers to create their own, independent energy grids to power them. 
Data centers are large facilities that house vast computer systems used for cloud storage, artificial intelligence computing and telecommunications; the centers require massive amounts of energy and electricity to run.
Through using their own microgrids, proponents for the policy say data centers would be able to operate in West Virginia without overburdening the state’s power and utility infrastructure or raising electricity rates for existing residential and commercial customers. 
Under the proposed bill, the state’s certified microgrid program would operate under the newly reorganized Division of Economic Development. Through approval from the division, data companies looking to operate in West Virginia would do so in “high impact industrial business development microgrid districts.” 
There, instead of being required to connect to the existing utilities in the region, they would create their own, smaller energy grids with the primary purpose of powering the data centers. Per the bill, 10% of electricity generated by the microgrids but not used by the data centers or industrial facilities would be allowed to be sold on the wholesale market to others nearby, potentially at lower rates than existing utilities currently offer.
The initial version of HB 2014 — the one specifically requested by Morrisey — included provisions that would have required electric utilities with coal fired plants to operate at 69% capacity and hold a 45-day supply of coal on hand at all times. Most coal fired power plants in the state operate at an average 40% capacity and stockpile a 30-day supply of coal.
Those provisions were meant to support the state’s coal industry, but power companies — including Appalachian Power, the state’s largest electric utility — said it would be difficult to meet those standards and doing so would have raised rates for existing electric customers in the state.
Through a committee substitute for HB 2014 passed by the House Energy and Public Works Committee last week, the coal-backed provisions were removed from the bill and not included in the version passed by the House on Tuesday.
In response to concerns raised by House members on the floor Tuesday regarding the potential for the bill to increase utility rates for residential customers, Del. Clay Riley, R-Harrison, said he actually believes HB 2014 could lead to savings for residents, though indirectly, through tax revenue generated locally and a fund that will be created by the legislation.
I do not believe [HB 2014] is going to increase [customer electric rates],” said Riley, a longtime proponent for data centers in the state and a sponsor of the bill. “I think it puts more money back in the pockets of citizens of West Virginia, both in terms of ratepaying and in terms of personal income taxes and some of the other things that I think I’ve seen in there.”
Riley said he estimates that roughly $160 million to $200 million will be generated in tax revenue annually for a county that houses a data center and microgrid. 
Following the payment of property taxes to the appropriate local agencies, other revenue from the data centers and related microgrids will be split between several statewide initiatives, including to: the Personal Income Tax Reduction Fund to offset personal income tax cuts, the Economic Development Closing and Promotion Fund to help recruit more businesses to the state, the Water Development Authority’s Economic Enhancement Grant Fund for water and sewage projects, the Department of Human Services’ Low Income Energy Assistance Program to help low-income families cover utility bills, the state general revenue fund and the newly created Electronic Grid Stabilization and Security Fund.
The Electronic Grid Stabilization and Security Fund, Riley said, could help utility companies cover the cost of maintenance and repairs in their infrastructure that would otherwise be — and often are — baked into customer rate increases. In other words, while that won’t directly decrease power costs for residents, it could offset future expenses they would incur.
Del. Henry Dillon, R-Wayne, said in addition to limiting future increases for ratepayers, the data centers and microgrids could mean a population and employment bump for the regions they’re located in. Jobs will be created while the facilities are being constructed, he said, and after that it’s likely that at least some jobs will stay in the areas.
That could help decrease another major factor that often leads to utility rate increases: population loss.
Dillon said, at first, he shared similar concerns to others worried that this initiative could lead to lackluster results and heavy costs for existing residents.
“But throughout the process of working on this bill … I believe that the governor is going in the right direction here,” Dillon said. “This is an attempt to innovate. This is an attempt to take a new approach to energy policy in the state, and it’s not going to harm our utility companies. It’s not going to harm ratepayers, it’s not going to harm oil and gas. It’s not going to harm coal. I believe that this is a net positive for the state.”",https://westvirginiawatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Clay-Riley-20250401.jpg,,,2025-04-01 19:06:08.951121

(Michael Achterling/North Dakota Monitor)Four North Dakota lawmakers announced they will be joining the national Future Caucus made up of millennial and Gen-Z legislators with hopes of finding bipartisan solutions to common problems.
North Dakota is the 36th state to join the Future Caucus, which began in 2013 and includes more than 1,900 young lawmakers nationwide.
Co-chairs for the North Dakota chapter are Rep. Jayme Davis, D-Rolette, Rep. Dawson Holle, R-Mandan, Sen. Claire Cory, R-Grand Forks, and Sen. Ryan Braunberger, D-Fargo.
“These leaders represent the best of North Dakota,” said Layla Zidane, president of the Future Caucus. 
She added North Dakota has a longstanding tradition of putting people above politics, which is exactly what the Future Caucus is trying to achieve – focusing on real solutions, not partisan fights.
“We’re not bringing in outside priorities,” Zidane said. “But really amplifying the amazing leadership that is already here.”
She said members of the Future Caucus helped pass more than 2,000 pieces of legislation across the country in 2024.

Holle said he initially ran for the Legislature in 2022 to advocate for family farms, small businesses and helping his community.
“In North Dakota’s future, I know that our greatest strength comes from working together, not against each other,” Holle said. “Too often, ideas are judged not on their merit, but on who proposed them and that is not leadership. That is not service and that is not what North Dakotans expect or deserve.”
Holle said the caucus wants to ensure the next generation of leaders is able to come together and facilitate the difficult conversations to find solutions.
Braunberger said he hopes the caucus brings people toward the ideological middle instead of the extreme-right or extreme-left.
“We are not always going to agree on every issue, but we’re going to come together on issues that we can,” Braunberger said. He added he believes the caucus will make lawmakers more productive by being able to have civil discourse with members of the opposing party.
Sen. Claire Cory, R-Grand Forks, said she and Braunberger don’t agree on many issues, but the caucus gives them an avenue to talk productively.
“Not to say that I don’t do that with other lawmakers, but being able to do it with people in my generation is different,” Cory said. 
Even as a Republican in a conservative state like North Dakota, Cory said she has constituents who didn’t vote for her and she still needs to represent them.
She added she hopes the caucus will help her understand issues from a more well-rounded perspective so she can be a better representative for all of her constituents.

(Perry Bennett | West Virginia Legislative Photography)The House of Delegates signed off on changes to homeschooling in West Virginia that included transferring oversight of thousands of homeschool students from local county boards of education to the state. 
House Bill 2777, sponsored by Del. Kathie Hess Crouse, R-Putnam, a homeschool parent, does away with the state’s requirement that a homeschooling parent have a high school diploma. 
The bill also addresses what some lawmakers have said is a dangerous loophole in current homeschool laws by pausing a parent’s request to homeschool if there’s a pending child abuse investigation against the parent.
More than 30,000 children are homeschooled in West Virginia. 
Last year, former Gov. Jim Justice and some Republican lawmakers called for strengthening the state’s homeschool reporting requirements after 14-year-old Kyneddi Miller, who was being homeschooled, died from apparent starvation in Boone County. Her mother hadn’t turned in any required assessments to the local county school board. 
Data from the West Virginia Department of Education last year showed that only about a third of families homeschooling their children turned in the required assessments to show student progress. State law doesn’t require that public school employees follow up on homeschool families who have failed to report a child’s progress.
West Virginia has one of the nation’s highest rates of child abuse, and the state’s foster care system has been overburdened largely with abuse and neglect cases.
Del. Josh Holstein, R-Boone, said the bill “would resolve future cases like that while still protecting the rights of homeschoolers.” The bill doesn’t address missing assessments, but it would pause a homeschool request by a parent involved in a pending child abuse or neglect investigation. The request would have to be resolved within 10 days. 
“We had a situation in Boone County that really devastated our county … I’m going to be a ‘yes’ on it,” Holstein said Tuesday on the House floor. 
The measure is similar to a bill known as “Raylee’s Law” passed last year by the House; it’s named for an eight-year-old girl who died of abuse and neglect in 2018 after her parents withdrew her from school. Educators at her elementary school had notified Child Protective Services of potential abuse. 
The legislation was spearheaded by Del. Shawn Fluharty, D-Ohio.
“Through the years of work, we’ve come up with bipartisan language to be included in this legislation,” Fluharty said. “If there’s one thing we can agree on in the body, all 100 of us, it’s pulling the rope together to protect children.”
Crouse said that the state is prepared to take on oversight of homeschool children. A spokesperson for the West Virginia Department of Education said the superintendent is not available to comment on the bill because it is still going through the legislative process. 
Crouse has repeatedly raised concerns about local school boards losing paperwork, including a parent’s notice of intent to homeschool, and requirement assessments turned in by homeschool parents.
 “The county does not do a good job of it… they lose most of them,” Crouse said. 
House Finance Chair Vernon Criss, R-Wood, asked Crouse about a fiscal note, prepared by the WVDE, saying management of the state’s homeschoolers, including an online “school choice portal,” would cost $700,000. The fiscal note was not included on the state’s legislative website with the bill.
“I would believe they probably made one up,” Crouse responded.
The bill passed the House with a vote of 75-22. 
On Monday, Del. Evan Worrell, R-Cabell, tried to amend the bill to remove the state’s requirement that parents or guardians of homeschool students are required to submit to the county superintendent academic assessments of the children at grade levels three, five, eight, and 11. The amendment was defeated with a vote of 36-59 after some lawmakers argued that the assessments were used to verify that children were learning at home. 
State would have to create ‘school choice portal’ without funding
The House also passed House Bill 3422, mandating that the state board of education oversee an online “school choice portal.” It would reduce the county’s workload and financial obligations, Crouse said.
“Half the time they lose the paperwork anyway,” she said. 
The school board would have to create the portal with input from individuals representing microschools, the Hope Scholarship and more.
Del. Lori Dittman, R-Braxton, voted against the measure, citing an unfunded mandate for the WVDE.
“This will be an unfunded mandate,” Dittman said. “This portal is a great idea, but it does come with a cost. And because it is unfunded and also with the current budget we have cut the education department by $11 million, I don’t think now is the time to do this portal.”
Crouse said she was told by the WVDE there would be no cost for them to operate the portal.
“I don’t foresee there being any,” she said. “I have numbers and figures here on how that would easily be taken care of,” she said.
Both bills will go to the Senate for consideration.

,DC,2025-04-01 22:40:43+00:00,News From The States - Fair. Fearless. Free.,Dem states sue Trump administration over sudden cancellation of $11B in health funds,Jacob Fischler,,,,,https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/dem-states-sue-trump-administration-over-sudden-cancellation-11b-health-funds,,"A coalition of Democratic state officials sued the Trump administration Tuesday over plans to cut more than $11 billion in grants by the Department of Health and Human Services, on the same day thousands of HHS workers reportedly found they’d been swept up in a mass layoff.In Washington, the Republican chairman and top Democrat on the Senate Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee wrote HHS Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. asking him to appear before the panel and discuss his plans for the massive agency.The federal suit, signed by 22 attorneys general and two Democratic governors, alleges Kennedy revoked, without warning, billions in grant funding appropriated by Congress during the COVID-19 pandemic, starting last week. That led to states scrambling to adjust plans for vaccination efforts, infectious disease prevention, mental health programs and more.The sudden and chaotic rollout of the grant cuts foreshadowed a scene at HHS offices, including at big campuses in Maryland, on Tuesday morning. Termination notices to laid-off workers were reportedly emailed early Tuesday, but many workers did not see them before arriving at the office and finding out they’d lost their jobs when their key cards did not work.Few specificsBoth the mass layoffs and the grant funding cuts challenged in the lawsuit stem from Kennedy’s March 27 announcement that the department would be “realigning,” by shuttering several offices and cutting 10,000 workers.It was unclear Tuesday exactly what offices or employees were affected.An HHS spokesperson responded to a request for comment by referring States Newsroom to Kennedy’s announcement, a press release and an accompanying fact sheet from March 27.None provided a detailed breakdown but laid out plans to eliminate 3,500 full-time positions at the Food and Drug Administration, 2,400 employees at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 1,200 staff at the National Institutes of Health and 300 workers at the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services.The spokesperson did not respond to a follow-up inquiry requesting more details of the positions eliminated and other clarifications.Efficiency doubtedIn a written statement, Andrés Arguello, a policy fellow at Groundwork Collective, a think tank focused on economic equity, said the cuts would have “the exact opposite” effect of the administration’s stated goal of government efficiency.“Gutting 10,000 public servants means higher costs, longer wait times, and fewer services for families already struggling with the rising cost of living,” Arguello, an HHS deputy secretary under former President Joe Biden, wrote. “Entire offices that support child care, energy assistance, and mental health treatment are being dismantled, leaving working families with fewer options and bigger bills. This isn’t streamlining—it’s abandonment, and the price will be paid by the sick, the vulnerable, and the poor.""The lack of communication led to confusion among advocates and state and local health workers about the impacts of the staff cuts and cast doubt about the administration’s goals, speakers on a Tuesday press call said.“There are so many more questions than answers right now,” Sharon Gilmartin, the executive director of Safe States Alliance, an anti-violence advocacy group, said. “They clearly are eliminating whole divisions and branches, which doesn't speak to bureaucratic streamlining. It speaks to moving forward an agenda, which has not been elucidated for the public health community, it's not been elucidated for the public.”While specific consequences of the cuts were not yet known, Gilmartin and others said they would be felt at the state and local level.“I think what we do know is that … when we're cutting these positions at the federal level, we are cutting work in states and communities,” Gilmartin said.Pain in the statesThe lawsuit from Democratic officials is full of details about the impacts of the loss of federal funding on state programs.The suit was brought in Rhode Island federal court by the attorneys general of Colorado, Rhode Island, California, Minnesota, Washington, Arizona, Connecticut, Delaware, the District of Columbia, Hawaii, Illinois, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, Michigan, Nevada, New Jersey, New Mexico, New York, North Carolina, Oregon and Wisconsin and Govs. Andy Beshear of Kentucky and Josh Shapiro of Pennsylvania.HHS revoked “more than half a billion dollars” of grants from Pennsylvania, the Democratic officials said, affecting more than 150 state employees and contracted staff. The grants funded work “to respond to and mitigate the spread of infectious disease across the Commonwealth” and mental health and substance abuse programs.In Nevada, “HHS abruptly terminated at least six grants” that had funded epidemiology and lab capacity, immunization access and mental health services, according to the suit.“These terminations led Nevada to immediately terminate 48 state employees and to order contractors working under these awards to immediately cease all activity,” the complaint reads. “The loss of funding will have substantial impacts on public health in Nevada.”The cutoff of $13 million in unobligated grants for local communities in Minnesota will mean the shuttering of clinics to provide vaccines for COVID-19, measles, mumps, rubella, influenza and other diseases, the suit said.“One local public health agency reported that it held 21 childhood vaccination clinics and provided approximately 1,400 vaccinations to children in 2024,” a paragraph in the complaint about Minnesota local vaccine clinics said. “It also held 87 general vaccination clinics in 2024. As a result of the termination of the … funds, it has immediately ceased all vaccination clinics for 2025.”The grant terminations also affected state plans already in the works.Rhode Island had received an extension from HHS for a grant with $13 million unspent, but that money was revoked last week.“Accordingly, the state public health department developed a workplan for its immunization program that included an April 2025 vaccination clinic for seniors, provided salaries for highly trained technicians to ensure that vaccine doses are stored and refrigerated correctly to prevent waste of vaccines purchased with other tax-payer dollars, planned computer system upgrades, and covered printing costs for communications about vaccine campaigns,” the suit said.Senators want RFK Jr. on the HillDemocrats on Capitol Hill issued a slew of statements opposing the cuts and warning of their effects.Republicans were more deferential to the administration, asking for patience as details of the cuts are revealed.But the letter from the top members of the Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee also brought both sides together to write Kennedy asking him to testify before the committee to make those explanations plain.“The hearing will discuss your proposed reorganization of the Department of Health and Human Services,” the letter from Louisiana Republican Bill Cassidy and Vermont independent Bernie Sanders said.In a written statement, Cassidy said the hearing would be an opportunity for Kennedy to inform the public about the reorganization.“The news coverage on the HHS reorg is being set by anonymous sources and opponents are setting the perceptions,” Cassidy said in a written statement. “In the confirmation process, RFK committed to coming before the committee on a quarterly basis. This will be a good opportunity for him to set the record straight and speak to the goals, structure and benefits of the proposed reorganization.”",,,,2025-04-01 19:06:08.951121

(Photo by Alexander Castro/Rhode Island Current)Rhode Island Attorney General Peter F. Neronha is once again teaming up with his fellow Democratic attorneys general in a lawsuit against President Donald Trump’s administration — this time over grants for post-pandemic health infrastructure that the feds abruptly cancelled last week.  
The suit, filed Tuesday in the U.S. District Court for the District of Rhode Island, is co-led by Neronha and AGs Phil Weiser of Colorado, Rob Bonta of California, Keith Ellison of Minnesota, and Nick Brown of Washington. An additional 17 AGs — plus the governors of Kentucky and Pennsylvania — are listed as plaintiffs in the suit, which is aimed at U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) Secretary Robert F. Kennedy, Jr. 
“The secretary and the president are dead wrong legally,” Neronha told reporters gathered at his offices on South Main Street in Providence. 
Under Kennedy’s leadership, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), which is overseen by HHS, ended $11.4 billion nationwide, including about $31 million in Rhode Island, in post-pandemic grants meant to build and maintain public health efforts that will help stave off future pandemics. That includes efforts like vaccination outreach and clinics, laboratory testing, and disease prevention and monitoring. 
Rhode Island Department of Health (RIDOH) officials learned about the cuts last week. The grants, previously allocated but still unspent, had expiration dates ranging from May 2025 to July 2026, and supported programs relating to child immunization, epidemiology, and initiatives to strengthen community-based health efforts and lessen health disparities.  
Neronha acknowledged that this case was “not dissimilar” from the other multi-state cases his office has joined against the federal government. One example is the January lawsuit against the Office of Management and Budget also filed in Rhode Island’s federal court and also led by Neronha — among the earliest examples of litigative resistance against the Trump administration’s avalanche of executive orders and agency directives.  
“T​​his administration has been replete with irrational decision making. This is just one context of it,”  Neronha said. 
But in this case, the endangered funds affect money on which “literally the health and safety of Rhode Islanders depend,” Neronha said.
HHS memo ‘defies common sense’ 
The CDC annulled the grants just a few weeks after the fifth anniversary of COVID-19 being declared a global pandemic. To underline the importance of preventing future outbreaks of the same scale, Neronha painted a landscape for reporters: Providence in 2020, when the streets and bridges were empty, and the traffic basically nonexistent.
“I remember very vividly the absence of people on the highway, the absence of people in Providence,” Neronha recalled. “I remember getting my nose swabbed in parking garages in Providence, Rhode Island Hospital, and at the train station in Wickford so that I could come to work.” 
“The notion that we could shut down our way of life for so long because of a pandemic was unthinkable,” Neronha continued. “Yet it happened.” 
Standing by Neronha’s side at the press conference was Dr. Jerome “Jerry” Larkin, director of the health department. Larkin supplemented Neronha’s depiction of life under the pandemic with a more recent example.  
“In January, we actually had a very vivid illustration of how public health works,” Larkin said, recounting how an unvaccinated Rhode Island child travelled internationally, “to a part of the world where measles is common,” and returned with the highly contagious disease as a souvenir — a situation that could have turned catastrophic, if not for the health department’s efforts.  
“Their diagnosis was made in a timely fashion,” Larkin said. “Appropriate response was put in place by our healthcare providers, by the Department of Health, that person recovered. Nothing happened.”
Larkin told Rhode Island legislators last week at committee hearings that the HHS memo nullifying the remaining grant money was technical. On Tuesday, he told reporters the dismissal was more like nonsense: “It’s difficult to explain that which defies common sense.”
The lost grants constitute 21% of the state’s overall federal funding, Larkin said, which is comparable to the CDC money lost in other states — $81 million in Maine and $87 million in Massachusetts, the doctor offered as examples.
“It has been difficult since January 20 to answer any question related to this administration,” Larkin added.
Neronha said that Trump is pushing the executive branch in an “authoritarian” direction, by frequently ignoring the powers of Congress to allocate money. 
“The fundamental legal problem is what he’s doing directly contradicts what the Congress told the president to do, which is to spend this money,” Neronha said. “That’s for you. We pay our federal taxes…to the federal government so that they can protect us from things that we can’t protect ourselves from.”
The legal complaint, which is seeking an injunction against HHS according to the 45-page initial court filing, did not have a hearing date scheduled as of Tuesday evening.

Cory Booker started his speech on Monday at 7 p.m. and said he would continue as long as he is ""physically able."" (Photo by John Partipilo)U.S. Sen. Cory Booker on Tuesday evening neared the 24-hour mark of a marathon speech on the Senate floor that began Monday night, remarks he said are intended to protest President Donald Trump’s policies on the nation’s budget, immigration, poverty and more.
“These are not normal times in our nation, and they should not be treated as such in the United States Senate,” said Booker, 55. “The threats to the American people and American democracy are grave and urgent, and we all must do more to stand against them.”
Booker, a Democrat first elected to the Senate in 2013, on Monday said he’d continue speaking as long as he is “physically able.” After his speech surpassed 20 hours, he looked exhausted, joked about his shirt being “ripe,” and took occasional breaks by yielding the floor for questions from his Democratic colleagues, who praised the former college football player for his endurance.
His speech comes as the Democratic Party faces criticism from voters who say the party’s leaders are not doing enough to stand up to Trump’s actions, especially those that experts say fly in the face of legal precedent.
“This is not right or left. It is right or wrong. This is not a partisan moment. It is a moral moment,” Booker said early Tuesday afternoon. “Where do you stand?”
Booker’s speech is one of the longest ever given on the Senate floor. The record is held by Strom Thurmond, a South Carolina Republican who held the floor for 24 hours and 18 minutes in 1957 in protest of the Civil Rights Act. As of 4:30 p.m. — 21 hours and 30 minutes after Booker started speaking — his speech became the fourth longest ever heard in the Senate.
Booker will beat Thurmond’s record if he’s still speaking at 7:19 p.m. Tuesday.
The senator has covered a breadth of topics: health care, Social Security, Medicaid, grocery prices, free speech, veterans, public education, world leaders, Elon Musk’s Department of Government Efficiency, and national security concerns. He read letters and comments from constituents and he quoted speeches from the late Rep. John Lewis — invoking Lewis’ famous call to action to “get in good trouble” — and the late Sen. John McCain.
Booker, a former mayor of Newark, also assailed Trump’s policies on immigration. He said the Trump administration is doing “outrageous things like disappearing people off of American streets, violating fundamental principles of this document” — here he held up a copy of the U.S. Constitution — “invoking the Alien Enemies Act from the 1700s that was last used to put Japanese Americans into internment camps.”
“Do we see what’s happening?” Booker asked.
He spent about a half-hour reading the account of Jasmine Mooney, a Canadian citizen who was detained by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement for 12 days in March. He also noted that the Trump administration conceded Monday that it deported Kilmar Abrego Garcia, a 29-year-old Maryland man with protected legal status, to an El Salvador prison because of an “administrative error.”
“The government can’t walk up to a human being and grab them off the street and put them on a plane and send them to one of the most notorious prisons in the world, and just say, as one of our authorities did, ‘Oopsie,’” Booker said.
Sen. Chuck Schumer (D-New York), who asked about the impact of potential Medicaid cuts and tariffs about 15 hours into Booker’s speech, told Booker he has the support of the entire party.
“Your strength, your fortitude, your clarity has just been nothing short of amazing. All of America is paying attention to what you’re saying. All of America needs to know there’s so many problems — the disastrous actions of this administration in terms of how they’re helping only the billionaires and hurting average families — you have brought this forth with such clarity,” he said.

,DC,2025-04-01 22:35:33+00:00,News From The States - Fair. Fearless. Free.,U.S. Senate GOP aims for budget resolution vote this week,Jennifer Shutt,,,,,https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/us-senate-gop-aims-budget-resolution-vote-week,,"WASHINGTON — U.S. Senate Republicans hope to approve a budget resolution this week that would clear the way for Congress to enact an extension of expiring tax law as well as sweeping cuts to federal spending later this year.Senate Majority Leader John Thune, R-S.D., said Tuesday the chamber will likely vote on the House-passed budget resolution later this week, after completing the vote-a-rama, where lawmakers vote on dozens of amendments, typically into the early morning hours.“Republicans continue to have very productive conversations on how to achieve our agenda and working with President Trump on making sure that we are rebuilding our military, unleashing American energy dominance, making sure there isn’t a four-and-a-half trillion tax increase on the American people at the end of this year and obviously securing our border,” Thune said.The House and Senate must vote to adopt the same budget resolution with matching instructions before they can use the complicated reconciliation process to move legislation through Congress on their own. The process allows the majority party to avoid the Senate filibuster that requires 60 votes for most legislation.One ‘big, beautiful bill’GOP lawmakers in the two chambers have been at odds for months over whether to move their core legislative goals in two bills or one package.The Senate approved a budget resolution in mid-February that would have addressed the issue in two bills, before the House voted later that month to move forward with a different budget resolution.The final, adopted budget resolution would set up Republicans to hold floor votes on one “big, beautiful bill,” as President Donald Trump has described it, later this year, if GOP leaders can keep nearly all of their members on board with the final product.Republicans hold unified control of Congress and the White House, but voters didn’t give the party especially wide margins.The GOP holds 218 seats in the 435-member House amid absences, though it could pick up two more members following special elections in Florida on Tuesday. Republicans hold 53 seats in the Senate.Any changes to tax law, energy policy or spending cuts will need support from nearly every GOP lawmaker in Congress, including centrists, who barely won election in swing districts, and far-right members, who are more likely to lose to a primary challenger claiming they’re not conservative enough.The House-passed resolution includes reconciliation instructions that would allow Congress later this year to extend the 2017 tax cuts and a range of other GOP policy priorities that could not survive the 60-vote threshold.Democratic amendmentsSenate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., said Tuesday that Democrats plan to put up amendments during budget debate that will showcase how the eventual bill could impact Americans.“We have had many good discussions, including today. And you are going to find us focused relentlessly on what … Donald Trump, Elon Musk and the Republican Senate and House are doing to the American people,” Schumer said. “They’re taking away benefits that they desperately need.”The Senate adopted just two amendments during its last vote-a-rama in February, one from Alaska Republican Sen. Dan Sullivan and one from Utah Republican Sen. Mike Lee.Democrats put forward numerous amendments but were unable to get any adopted.",,,,2025-04-01 19:06:08.951121

James Blanchard, a former U.S. Ambassador to Canada, slammed President Donald Trump's approach to foreign relations with the U.S.'s northern neighbor during the Detroit Regional Chamber's State of the Region presentation on April 1, 2025. | ScreenshotWhile the Detroit Regional Chamber celebrated a resilient economy, low unemployment and a prosperous business environment in the region, President Donald Trump’s trade policies cast a cloud over the state’s future as business and political leaders warned that a trade war with Canada could bring particular harm to metro Detroit. 
Arguing Canada has not done its part in combating the flow of migrants and fentanyl into the United States, Trump has levied a 25% additional tariff on goods from the nation’s northern neighbor, with a lower 10% tariff on energy resources from Canada.
Trump has also ordered a 25% tariff on all Canadian steel and aluminum imports and a 25% tariff on imported cars and light trucks, which economists have said could reduce 2025 US auto sales by 700,000 vehicles.
Canada has responded by levying tariffs of its own on more than $30 billion in U.S. goods including orange juice, peanut butter, wine, spirits, beer, coffee, appliances and more. It has also imposed a 25% reciprocal tariff on $12.6 billion worth of U.S. steel products, $3 billion in aluminum products, and $14.2 billion in additional goods including tools, computers and servers, display monitors, sport equipment and cast-iron products.
While the Canadian government has said all options are on the table should the U.S. continue to impose tariffs, Trump has labeled Wednesday, April 2, “Liberation Day” with plans to announce massive tariffs in an effort to fulfill his administration’s economic promises, although the details of his plans still remain unclear. 
Addressing members of the chamber and their guests on Tuesday, James Blanchard, a former Democratic governor of Michigan who served as the ambassador to Canada from 1993 to 1996, pointed to the benefits of the centuries-long alliance between the U.S. and its neighbor to the north, noting the two countries have held an integrated economy in the automotive, energy, agriculture and national security sectors for years. 
With many economists predicting a recession and Ford CEO Jim Farley warning a 25% tariff on autos would “blow a hole” in the U.S. auto industry, Blanchard warned further tariffs could bring serious harm to businesses and consumers. 

“I’m not an economist. I’m not an astrologist. All I know is Liberation Day could become Inflation Day if we don’t watch it. And that’s serious,” Blanchard said. 
From allying together in World War I and II, the Korean War and the War in Afghanistan, serving as founding members of the United Nations and NATO, as well as partners in NORAD, holding integrated economies and partnering on issues pertinent to the Great Lakes, Blanchard said there is “no good reason” to label Canada a national security threat or trade villain or to suggest it should become the 51st state, in reference to remarks from Trump suggesting Canada would be better off as part of the U.S.

Additionally, Blanchard claimed more migrants have been heading north into Canada than south into the U.S., challenging the President’s rationale for initiating a trade war with what has long been regarded as one of its closest allies.
According to the Canadian government, the country has experienced an influx of individuals crossing between official ports of entry, though it has not publicly released statistics on the number of irregular border crossings since the beginning of 2025.
Blanchard also noted that fentanyl coming from Canada represented less than 1% of fentanyl seizures nationwide.
The former ambassador later noted that Canada was the largest importer of American goods, pointing to energy imports as the cause of the U.S.’s trade deficit with Canada.
“We want that. Michigan uses that. We need that on any given day, natural gas which heats the homes and businesses in this town is probably natural gas from Canada, either shipped directly or back from Ontario,” Blanchard said, 
He once again challenged Trump, noting the country is already leading the globe in oil production, countering the president’s argument that the country is facing an energy crisis. 
Throughout his speech Blanchard called on Michiganders to show their appreciation for their friends and family members in Canada, pointing to the opening of the new Gordie Howe International Bridge between Detroit and Windsor planned for this Fall as an opportunity to celebrate the nation’s friendship.
“Let’s celebrate that as we move forward, and let’s make sure no one distorts the truth about how fabulous this relationship is,” he said. 
Tariffs carry heavy consequences for Michigan Business, Detroit Regional Chamber president warns
While the Detroit Regional Chamber’s 2025 State of the Region report showed strong economic growth, job growth, growth in commercial real estate market as well as strong activity in venture capital, the chamber’s President and CEO Sandy Baruah warned that region was particularly susceptible to the impacts of Trump’s trade policy, with its report noting that 234,000 jobs in the Detroit Region rely on trade and investment with Canada. 
“In just, you know, literally two or three months, we’ve seen one of the biggest drops in nationwide CEO confidence we’ve ever seen and Michigan is at a disproportionate risk with some of the changes that we are seeing potentially at the federal level, everything from changes in [electric vehicle] policy, electrification, infrastructure and certainly tariffs,” Baruah said.

“We’re an automotive state. Our supply chains are completely integrated. There is no other state in the nation that has a more integrated supply chain than with the nation of Canada, than Michigan, particularly around automotive and manufacturing,” Baruah said. 
While Blanchard highlighted the U.S.’s personal ties to Canada, Baruah further emphasized the economic ties, noting that one in eight residents of the Detroit Region workers hold ties to Canada in addition to 650 Canadian companies with major footprints in Michigan. 
According to a poll conducted by the Lansing-based Glengariff group in partnership with the Chamber, Baruah said nearly 70% of Michigan voters believed Canada is an economic friend of the U.S., while a majority understand that tariffs on Canadian goods will hurt Michigan’s economy. 
Economic and global threats of worsening relations with Canada
Following Baruah’s breakdown of the chamber’s economic report, lawyer and International Trade expert Aida Dismondy joined Blanchard and Baruah alongside Consul General of Canada in Detroit Colin Bird for a discussion moderated by Devin Scillian, a longtime journalist who retired from WDIV-TV 4 in December. 
The panelists severely criticized Trump’s actions against Canada, with Bird noting that 70% of exports from Canada into the U.S. are further input into manufacturing.

“What that speaks to is what we do in this region of highly integrated trade… that’s what makes it really valuable for me as a Canadian diplomat here in Michigan to know that this is not a Michigan policy. This is a made in Washington problem, and we need to be working together across this border to protect this region together,” Bird said. 
Dismondy echoed Blanchard’s earlier remarks about friends in Canada, noting that she had told her clients their suppliers are their best allies at the moment. 
“In a time when the federal government has let us down from a trade policy perspective, it is this time when going back to [the] Governor’s remarks, not only to just call our friends, but our business partners and come together as a united front, because it is through business partners that we will continue these relationships at a time when chaos and insecurity or uncertainty is looming large,” Dismondy said. 
On Friday, Baruah, alongside Glenn Stevens Jr., the executive director of MichAuto, which advocates for the state’s automotive and mobility sector, sent a letter to the U.S. Secretary of Treasury, the U.S. Secretary of Commerce, the U.S. Trade Representative and the state’s congressional delegation, asking them to continue a pause on applying tariffs to auto parts that comply with the United States–Mexico–Canada trade agreement and advising against levying tariffs on vehicles produced outside of Mexico and Canada as well as parts produced outside North America.

When asked to expand on this letter, Baruah told Scillian he could not see the end game of these policies. 
“When I talk to people who are close to the president, people who are in the administration, Republican members of Congress, etc, etc. And they kind of give us the talking points. They say ‘Well, you know, there’s going to be short term pain, you know, but it’s, you know, we’re going to bring, you know, we’re going to bring manufacturing back here,’” Baruah said. 
“Tell me how that’s going to happen in a political cycle, because, you know, best case scenario, it takes three, four years to build an automotive plant, it takes about that same amount of time, if you’re lucky, to build an aluminum plant, right? So how does, frankly, the Trump administration, from a political standpoint, withstand the unemployment that’s going to happen, the slowdown in the economy,” Baruah asked, warning that tariffs could lead to rising prices due to tariffs and high unemployment as industries slow down.
Bird later noted that the U.S.’s actions toward Canada had spurred the country into conversations with other trade partners as other countries also expect to face U.S. tariffs.

“How do we reimagine some trading arrangements that, frankly, we have not put enough effort into because this has been such an easy, effective relationship that we’ve had with the United States. So it’s forcing us to be more creative, and it’s uniting Canadians in a way that I’ve never seen, and makes me proud,” Bird said. 
Dismondy, Blanchard and Baruah further stressed the importance of allies as the U.S. works to protect itself from economic threats alongside threats to national security, focusing on Russia and China.

“The only way, given China’s frankly, very strong competitive advantages, to combat the Chinese economic and national security threats is to do it together,” Baruah said. 
However, there is some good news, Blanchard said, pointing to Trump’s nominee for ambassador to Canada, Pete Hoekstra, the former chair of the Michigan Republican Party, who served as ambassador to the Netherlands under Trump’s first administration as well as a U.S. Representative from 1993 to 2011.
“He is eminently qualified to be ambassador to Canada or just about anywhere. He does have the ear of President Trump. I’ve spoken with him. I said, “You got a big job, but you’re up to it, Pete.’ So I think he will be helpful to a reasonable degree, and I think that’s good for Michigan and good for our country,” Blanchard said.

(Michael Achterling/North Dakota Monitor)A resolution to change North Dakota’s term limits law failed in the House on a narrow 46-43 vote Tuesday, but could be reconsidered on Wednesday after five people were absent during the vote.
The resolution received a majority of the votes in the chamber, but failed to cross the elected majority threshold of 48 votes to be passed.
Senate Resolution 4008, sponsored by Sen. Michael Dwyer, R-Bismarck, would allow lawmakers to serve four complete terms, a total of 16 years, in either chamber of the Legislature. It also clarifies a partial term of a lawmaker would not count against the term limit.
North Dakota voters in 2022 passed a measure that put term limits for state legislators into the North Dakota Constitution. Lawmakers are now limited to serving up to eight years in the House and up to eight years in the Senate.
On Monday, the House Government and Veterans Affairs Committee gave the resolution a do not pass recommendation on an 8-5 vote.
Changing term limits targeted in North Dakota Senate resolution

Rep. Lori VanWinkle, R-Minot, urged lawmakers to reject the resolution.  
“I don’t know how we’re going to justify overrunning the will of the people,” VanWinkle said. “The power reserved to changing term limits is reserved to the initiative process.”
Rep. Steve Vetter, R-Grand Forks, said all the measure does is keep lawmakers in the same chamber without needing to change chambers after eight years.
“The senators don’t want to become representatives,” Vetter said. “That’s really what this bill is because that’s all it does.” 
Rep. Bernie Satrom, R-Jamestown, said he’s spoken with people who believed they were signing a petition and voting on term limits for members of the U.S. Congress in 2022, not the state Legislature.
“I think there’s a question on whether this was the will of the people,” Satrom said. “There was questions about many of the signatures. There was questions about how it was advertised and promoted … We shouldn’t be afraid to put this before the people.”
The resolution passed the Senate in March on a 24-23 vote.
If reconsidered and passed by the House, the resolution would be put to the voters during the 2026 general election.
Another term limit bill, House Bill 1300, passed the Senate on March 28, however the bill was amended and would need to be approved by committee chairs in the House or go to a conference committee between the chambers.
The amended House Bill 1300 clarifies the start date of the legislative term limits to begin with lawmakers elected after Jan. 1, 2023.

(Photo by John Moore/Getty Images)Disabled Pennsylvania veterans may get a boost in their pensions, under legislation in the Pennsylvania Senate. 
The proposal is one of five pieces of legislation advanced by the state Senate Veterans Affairs & Emergency Preparedness on Tuesday.
Senate Bill 534 is sponsored by Sens. Judy Ward (R-Blair) and Devlin Robinson (R-Allegheny).
“Under current law, Pennsylvania veterans who suffered service connected injuries or diseases that resulted in a loss of vision, paralysis or the loss of two or more extremities, are eligible to receive a pension of $150 per month,” Robinson said on Tuesday. “Senate Bill 534 would increase the pension amount from $150 to $180 per month for both programs.”
As of Nov. 30, 2024, Robinson said 98 people across Pennsylvania were in the blind veterans pension program, while 2,345 are in the amputee and paralyzed veterans pension program.
Robinson, a military veteran, said the two initiatives have not received any increase since 1999 and a similar effort in the previous session cleared the committee, but did not get passed by both chambers.
The bill was supported unanimously on Tuesday, although an effort from Democratic Sen. Katie Muth, Minority Chair of the committee, to add an amendment to establish an annual cost of living adjustment for both programs was tabled.
Boosting veteran owned businesses
Senate Bill 64, sponsored by state Sen. Camera Bartolotta (R-Washington), would create a special logo to be used for veteran owned businesses in the commonwealth.
According to the Senate Republican Communications Office, a business must be registered with the Department of State and at least 51% of the ownership interest must be held by a veteran, reservist or member of the National Guard to be eligible.

“They’re deserving of our support in any and every way we can possibly show it,” Bartolotta said. “And I think this is just a way to signal to the community that the owner of that business served our country and…if we prefer to support those kinds of businesses, this is a way that we can do it.”
Pennsylvania has the fourth largest veteran population in the nation.
In an effort to discourage the logo from being used for fraudulent purposes, those who falsely claim to be a veteran to get this designation would face a third degree misdemeanor, with fines associated with the violation awarded to the Veterans’ Trust Fund.

Ed Setzler pitches his RFRA bill at an April 1 press conference. Ross Williams/Georgia RecorderWith the 2025 legislative session set to expire at the end of the week, supporters of a controversial “religious freedom” bill gathered in the Capitol to call for its final passage.
  Sen. Ed Setzler. Ross Williams/Georgia Recorder
Acworth Republican Sen. Ed Setzler’s Senate Bill 36, also known as the ​​Georgia Religious Freedom Restoration Act, or RFRA, has passed the Senate and a House committee. Passage through the full House would send it to Gov. Brian Kemp’s desk.
“Every Georgian should be free to exercise their faith without unfair federal, state, and local government intrusion,” Setzler said. “Senate Bill 36, the Religious Freedom Restoration Act, protects ordinary people from unfair state and local government intrusion by exactly mirroring the language from the federal RFRA law that protects people from unfair federal government intrusion.”
Setzler said 39 states have RFRA laws on the books and characterizes his bill as a way to protect religious liberties at the state and local level the same way the First Amendment protects them at the federal level. He gave the example of a Native American boy whose school tried to make him cut his long braided hair that was part of his religious and cultural heritage. Setzler said the boy’s family won a lawsuit under their state’s RFRA law.
Opponents say without statewide civil rights protections, a RFRA law would allow religious Georgians to discriminate against LGBTQ people or members of religious minorities.
  Rep. Esther Panitch. Jill Nolin/Georgia Recorder
“Cloaked in religion, Georgians can deny thousands of people the ability to live the American dream,” said Atlanta Democratic Sen. RaShaun Kemp, who is gay, in a statement. “The truth is, these bills aren’t helping Georgians. That is why we fight them. Because we know bills like this don’t do anything but drive a wedge between neighbors, and harm minorities.”
Rep. Esther Panitch, a Sandy Springs Democrat and the state’s only currently-serving Jewish state legislator, took issue with Setzler when he said the bill would mostly protect minority religions rather than evangelical Christianity.
“That’s a lie,” she said. “Every time I try to stand up for asking for religious liberty for Jews and how it would be affected by a state RFRA, they essentially say that my religious liberties don’t matter.”
“For example, in Judaism, life does not begin at conception,” she said. “Just look at Israel. (Abortion) is legal and it’s accessible, the Jewish state, but if I need one, I can’t get one. And so in this state, my religious liberties are being degraded in favor of a Christian majority.”
Panitch pointed to Indiana, where the state court of appeals ruled that the right to an abortion can be protected under that state’s RFRA law.
“RFRA is now being used in Indiana to create religious exemptions for Jewish women, so on some level, if it passes no matter my objections, I’m going to really enjoy when RFRA gets used to invalidate the heartbeat bill.”
Panitch was referencing Georgia’s abortion law, sponsored by Setzler in 2019 when he was in the state House.
  Cole Muzio. Ross Williams/Georgia Recorder
Panitch said she had asked House leadership not to let the bill come to the floor, but influential conservatives are putting pressure on the House to move forward on RFRA.
Cole Muzio, head of the evangelical Frontline lobbying firm, gave lawmakers a not-so-subtle message at Setzler’s rally.
“As we look ahead to next year, whether it’s primary season or general election season, we have long memories and we have expectations, and we expect this to be done now,” he said.
Similar bills have fallen short in the Georgia Legislature in recent years, but Setzler said he is confident the House will vote on and pass SB 36 this year.
“I would welcome a large bipartisan vote, but I know we’ve got the votes on the floor of the House to do this, it’s just a matter of making the decision that we need to do it this year,” he said. “I thank the leadership that’s deliberating on this carefully, they’re friends of mine, they believe in this deeply. It’s a matter of timing. I think it’s important to recognize that timing, respectfully, is now.”

(Photo by Robin Opsahl/Iowa Capital Dispatch)Immigrant rights and religious advocates at a Senate subcommittee meeting Tuesday said legislation establishing a new crime for the act of human smuggling could penalize people working with undocumented communities.
The measure, House File 572, would establish human smuggling as a criminal offense, including acts of transporting a person in violation of federal immigration laws with the intent to conceal them from law enforcement, encouraging or coercing a person to enter or stay in the U.S. against the law by concealing or harboring them, and directing multiple individuals to be on agricultural lands without the landowner’s consent.
The crime would be charged as a Class C felony. A higher charge of a Class B felony would be brought in some cases, such as when the crime is committed for monetary gain, if the victim is put in danger of serious bodily injury or death, or if the case involves minors.
A Class A felony charge would apply for situations where the victim is sexually abused and in cases where the crime results in the victim suffering serious bodily injury or death.
While advocates said no one is in support of smuggling, they said the bill could lead to people who work with immigrant communities being charged with “smuggling” crimes — and that Latino Iowans engaged in this work could be targeted by law enforcement.
Elizabeth Balcarcel, a member of the Iowa Migrant Movement for Justice, an immigrant rights organization, said that there are already federal laws in place to address human trafficking, and that creating this new offense would not help victims in Iowa.
“These new state-level criminal offenses would just lead to increased targeting of immigrants and their allies in our state, increased fear in immigrant communities, and additional cost to the taxpayers,” Balcarcel said. “If we want to protect victims of human trafficking, we should direct those resources to centers that provide direct services to victims and to fix the immigration system.”
Multiple speakers with churches and religious organizations said their work — and their religious freedom to provide assistance to undocumented people — could also be impacted by the bill. Tom Chapman with the Iowa Catholic Conference said though Catholic teachings recognize the right of a country to maintain its borders, their religious practice also teaches providing help and services to newcomers, which could be penalized under the bill.
“Does ‘encourage or induce a person to remain in the U.S.’ mean providing food or shelter to an immigrant?” Chapman said. “We don’t want to get into a situation, as we have seen in at least one other state, where authorities, based on a similar bill, are trying to shut down some Catholic ministries that are helping migrants with basic needs.”
In Texas, a Catholic shelter network, Annunciation House, the state attorney general alleged the nonprofit had violated a similar anti-smuggling law in 2024 for its efforts to help people suspected of being undocumented immigrants.
But Sen. Scott Webster, R-Bettendorf, argued that the bill will not have the effects that some advocates describe. He said some speakers were describing a 2024 bill that was passed by the Iowa House but did not survive in the Senate and which had much broader implications for groups serving immigrant communities.
Webster said the 2025 legislation was much more “narrowly tailored” to address actual labor, sex and human traffickers, pointing to the fact that individuals must “knowingly” commit these crimes.
“This bill is much more tailored than last year’s, where, essentially, if you put them — put somebody in a car and you didn’t know their immigration status, you could have been thrown in jail,” Webster said. “This one is much more narrow to somebody trying to smuggle somebody who knows that they’re illegal, and they broke those laws — not that they’re undocumented, but that they’re actually (illegally in the country.)”
Lucas Asbury, an attorney with Iowa MMJ, said if “the concern really is to support victims … then what we need to do is we need to create protections for them.”
“We need to get ways for them to come forward and talk to the police, rather than creating this myriad of fear which is going to create a chilling effect,” Asbury said. “It’s going to make law enforcement’s job harder, because they won’t be able to go into these communities. They will be distrusted, disliked, and no one here wants that.”
Though many speakers Tuesday said the bill would negatively impact immigrant communities, Sen. Julian Garrett, R-Indianola, said the measure is meant to provide protections to such groups.
“I want to re-emphasize this bill is aimed at the smugglers, the people that are taking advantage of the immigrants,” Garrett said. “This bill is not aimed at the immigrants.”
The bill came before the Senate subcommittee after passing the Iowa House 75-14 in March. During floor debate in the House, Rep. Steven Holt, R-Denison, said the measure was needed to address situations occurring in Iowa, such as the alleged human trafficking of six Guatemalan nationals at Centrum Valley Farms who claimed the company denied them overtime pay and threatened them with deportation.
Labor advocate groups said the measure would not necessarily help law enforcement stop labor trafficking in the state. Peter Hird with the Iowa Federation of Labor said a labor trafficker “isn’t likely the person who’s driving the van of workers, it’s the larger entity who’s financing the entire operation.”
Felicia Hilton with the North Central States Regional Council of Carpenters said measures that would increase enforcement worker compensation laws and other labor protections would more effectively uncover and penalize labor traffickers in Iowa.
The bill moved forward with support from Webster and Garrett. Sen. Izaah Knox, D-Des Moines, did not sign off on the bill.
Webster told advocates he was open to amendments to the bill, but that he supported enacting harsher punishments for people committing these crimes.
“Instead of sitting back looking at this and saying, ‘Don’t do this bill,’ figure out ways to get this to actually (target) smuggling if you’re concerned about the situations,” Webster said.",https://iowacapitaldispatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/smugglingsub4.1-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-04-01 19:06:08.951121

The defense for Jennifer Crumbley, who a jury determined held some responsibility for the four students her son murdered in a school shooting on Nov. 30, 2021, has been appealing her conviction, arguing that McDonald violated constitutional, legal, and ethical duties throughout the case.

Michael Dezsi, the attorney representing Crumbley, has argued that McDonald and her office have engaged in a “smear campaign” against Crumbley, paying more than $100,000 towards public relations firms to sway the court of public opinion and the jurors. Additionally, Dezsi has reasoned that the prosecution’s use of proffer agreements for two school employees who testified in Crumbley’s case, were kept from the defense and jury and would have potentially had an impact on Crumbley’s defense strategy.
Oakland County Circuit Judge Cheryl Matthews decision to reject the defense’s request to remove and disqualify the Oakland County Prosecutor’s Office from Crumbley’s case fails to right the wrongs of the case which was “off the rails from the beginning” Dezsi said in a statement Tuesday.
“In the face of such mounting evidence surrounding the prosecutor’s misconduct and mishandling of the case, the trial court denied Mrs. Crumbley’s motion to remove the prosecutor finding that the court lacks jurisdiction to hear such motion,” Dezsi said. “I strongly disagree with the court’s decision that it doesn’t have jurisdiction to hear the evidence of the prosecutor’s misconduct, and I will take the issue up to the Michigan Court of Appeals to review today’s decision from the trial court.”
Jennifer Crumbley found guilty of involuntary manslaughter in Oxford High School shooting

Matthews reasoned in her decision that she does not have the jurisdiction to remove a prosecutor from a case at the circuit court level and that is an issue for an appeals court. Furthermore, the motion to remove the prosecutor to the circuit court is “at its heart…a collateral attack” on Crumbley’s conviction as it seeks to raise issues that would be considered by the appeals court.
Finding the motion for removal of the prosecutor duplicative with the request for a retrial, raising the same issues, Matthews ordered sanctions on Crumbley’s defense.
“This duplication creates unnecessary overlap and redundancy. The Court finds that the Motion was filed for an improper purpose and is not warranted by existing law,” Matthews wrote. “…a sanction for the violation will be reflected in the Court’s decision to approve reimbursement of appellate counsel fees with regard to the time spent preparing and filing the motion.”
McDonald has said the defense’s mischaracterization of prosecution of her case is an “irresponsible abuse of the court system” to attack common practice actions taken by her office in a case which was unprecedented.

McDonald’s office has repeatedly said the proffer agreements for Shawn Hopkins, who was a school counselor at Oxford High School, where the shooting took place and Nick Ejak, the former dean of students at the school, did not offer any promises of immunity to future prosecutions. Further, the funds that paid for the public relations firms to perform crisis communication were provided and approved by elected leaders of Oakland County and the firms’ hirings were very public matters, Assistant Prosecuting Attorney Marc A. Keast said in a previous brief.
Crumbley, along with her husband, is currently serving a 10 to 15 year prison sentence for her role in the killings of Oxford High School students Tate Myre, 16; Hana St. Juliana, 14; Justin Shilling, 17, and Madisyn Baldwin, 17 who were gunned down by her then 15-year-old son who was sentenced to life in prison without the possibility of parole in December of 2023.
The Tuesday ruling underscores the Oakland County Prosecutor’s Office’s commitment to fighting for justice for the Oxford community, McDonald said in a statement following the ruling.
“The court showed it has no tolerance for the defense’s misuse of the legal process, and they have been appropriately sanctioned,” McDonald said. “Let’s be clear about what this case is really about: If not for Jennifer Crumbley’s actions, Madisyn, Tate, Hana, and Justin would still be here. I will never stop fighting for them.”

(Photo by Catherine McQueen/Getty Images)Utahns who are enrolled in Medicaid and are at least 21 years old are now eligible for dental care, Utah health officials announced on Tuesday.
Up until now, only certain groups of Utahns enrolled in Medicaid have been eligible for dental coverage, including children, pregnant women, adults undergoing treatment for substance use disorder, people who are blind and disabled, and adults that are 65 or older. 
However, Utah’s coverage expanded through the 1115 Demonstration Waiver approved by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) earlier this year, the Utah Department of Health and Human Services announced in a news release. 
Utah becomes the first state to ban adding fluoride to drinking water

 
The new coverage was announced as Utah became the first state in the nation to ban adding fluoride to public drinking water. The bill, HB81, takes effect May 7. 
An estimated 120,000 adult Utahns enrolled in Medicaid will now have access to dental services that may include check ups, X-rays, cleanings every six months, fillings, root canals, extractions, dentures, emergency exams for severe pain, and crowns, according to state health officials. 
The new coverage will be made possible through a partnership between Utah Medicaid and the University of Utah School of Dentistry (UUSOD), which will administer and provide the care. 
“After leveraging its own resources, UUSOD has stepped in to bridge a gap with the collective goal of providing high quality dental care for adults on Medicaid, ” Jen Strohecker, director of Utah Medicaid, said in a prepared statement.  “We are grateful for this strong and strategic partnership rooted in our commitment to care for all members of our community.”
The U.’s School of Dentistry has a network of more than 300 dentists in offices across the state. It also has dental providers that work at school clinics, rural clinics, and a mobile clinic van that travels to underserved areas. 
Utah health officials also noted that the U.’s dentist school’s provider network was “established after identifying populations who experience barriers in accessing dental care and services as a resource for the dental profession in Utah — while not competing for patients in the private sector.” 
Dentists enrolled in the U.’s network are offered a reimbursement incentive in addition to Medicaid reimbursement rates, as well as free continuing education courses, according to state health officials. They encouraged dentists who are interested in joining the network to learn more about the program on the U.’s website and apply.  
“The process is streamlined, the compensations are better,” said James Bekker, associate dean of professional, community and strategic relations at UUSOD. “Utah Medicaid is not your mother’s Medicaid. This is different.”
Utahns enrolled in medicaid can also choose a dentist by browsing the Medicaid website or call 1-866-608-9422.

(Courtesy of the Pennsylvania Department of Transportation)It’s getting down to crunch time for Pennsylvanians to get their REAL ID card.
As the May 7 deadline for REAL ID approaches, state Department of Transportation (PennDOT) Secretary Mike Carroll provided an update on Tuesday about the process.
“Starting May 7, if you don’t have a Real ID or a passport, then you’re not going to be able to board a commercial flight anywhere in Pennsylvania,” Carroll said on Tuesday.
Next month, the federal law mandating a REAL ID card or driver’s license goes into effect. Not only will it be needed for domestic flights, but also to enter a federal building or military installation, following the May 7 deadline.
Carroll said a REAL ID care will have a gold star in the corner of the ID.
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
At this point, about 26%, or about 2.5 million drivers in the state, have already secured their cards or licenses.
The REAL ID is optional for Pennsylvanians, if they have a passport. Without either one, a person will not be able to board a commercial flight in the state following the deadline, even if a ticket was purchased prior to May 7.
So a little more than a month before the deadline, Carroll issued a warning about the current wait times for people waiting until the last minute.
“There’s a lot of procrastinators out there and our driver’s license centers now have real serious issues with respect to a lot of folks showing up, even before the driver center opens,” Carroll said. “We’ll do our best to get you in and out of there quickly. And I’m hopeful that folks that don’t have to go to the driver’s license center that can take advantage of renewals online or via the mail, will take that opportunity.”
Carroll said PennDOT is “being aggressive with respect to opening driver’s license centers on Mondays, when we’re traditionally closed.”
“But 57 driver’s licenses across the state will be open on Mondays through April and the first Monday in May,” Carroll said, with the exception of Easter Monday, April 21, when the centers will be closed.
  Gov. Josh Shapiro nominated Michael Carroll to be PennDOT secretary. (Photo via Gov.-elect Josh Shapiro’s transition team)
PennDOT’s website lists which ones will be open those extra days.
“I hope that people take advantage of this opportunity,” Carroll said.
He said the PennDOT website provides a checklist of the documents needed to bring with you to acquire the REAL ID, including if you had a name change during your life.
When acquiring a REAL ID, you’re also renewing your driver’s license at the same time, which means it costs $30 and the renewal fee.
“So, you’ll renew your driver’s license, you’ll pay the $30 for the REAL ID in addition to your renewal fee, and then we add four years to your current license,” Carroll said. “So, you could have a scenario where you have a license that’s good for seven or even eight years, depending on when you re-newed.”
“So you don’t lose time on the current license that you have,” he added. “We simply add four years to the license time that you’ve already paid for.”
A Pennsylvanian can acquire a REAL ID after the deadline, but would not be able to fly commercially without the ID or passport.
In an effort to get the word out, Carroll said they have done events in Philadelphia and Pittsburgh, with similar ones planned in Allentown, Erie, and Scranton leading up to the May 7 deadline.
“A lot of folks wait to the last minute, but that last minute is now,” Carroll said. “We’re about a month away from the deadline here.”
Tuesday’s update from Carroll is the first in a series of virtual events that will be held regularly in the weeks leading up to the start of the federal enforcement date.

Ohio House Republicans have announced their version of the state budget, dramatically slashing K-12 public school funding after months of uncertainty.
After facing questions about school funding for months, House Speaker Matt Huffman, R-Lima, and Finance Chair Brian Stewart, R-Ashville, decided not to fully fund public schools in their proposed amendment to the H.B. 96 budget.



To be fully funded based on statistics from the Fair School Funding Plan from 2021, schools would need $666 million. The proposed budget only gives them about $226 million.
Based on 2025 numbers and inflation, the amount of money to fund K-12 would be closer to $800 million, new data from public school advocates like former lawmaker John Patterson explained.
In a press conference Tuesday, the Republican leaders gave an overview of their substitute bill. Reporters were not given the legislation beforehand, nor did we get it during the event, so questions were based on what the lawmakers said without specifics.
In January, Huffman had threatened to cut public education spending, saying the state doesn’t have the budget for it and the amount for schools they were promised this year is “unsustainable.” Instead, they cut $351 million.
This comes as Gov. Mike DeWine fully funded public education in his version of the budget.
When proposed by the governor, he projected the budget would be $108 billion for fiscal year 2026 and $110 billion for fiscal year 2027 — $218 billion total.
The GOP legislators’ proposal isn’t final — but it likely won’t change dramatically before it passes out of the House and into the Senate next week.

Cory Booker says in marathon Senate speech",Sophie Nieto-Munoz,,,,,https://newjerseymonitor.com/2025/04/01/these-are-not-normal-times-sen-cory-booker-says-in-marathon-senate-speech/,"Sen. Cory Booker started his speech on Monday at 7 p.m. and said he would continue as long as he is ""physically able.""","Sen. Cory Booker started his speech on Monday at 7 p.m. and said he would continue as long as he is ""physically able."" (John Partipilo)U.S. Sen. Cory Booker on Tuesday evening neared the 24-hour mark of a marathon speech on the Senate floor that began Monday night, remarks he said are intended to protest President Donald Trump’s policies on the nation’s budget, immigration, poverty and more.
“These are not normal times in our nation, and they should not be treated as such in the United States Senate,” said Booker, 55. “The threats to the American people and American democracy are grave and urgent, and we all must do more to stand against them.”
Booker, a Democrat first elected to the Senate in 2013, on Monday said he’d continue speaking as long as he is “physically able.” After his speech surpassed 20 hours, he looked exhausted, joked about his shirt being “ripe,” and took occasional breaks by yielding the floor for questions from his Democratic colleagues, who praised the former college football player for his endurance.
His speech comes as the Democratic Party faces criticism from voters who say the party’s leaders are not doing enough to stand up to Trump’s actions, especially those that experts say fly in the face of legal precedent.
“This is not right or left. It is right or wrong. This is not a partisan moment. It is a moral moment,” Booker said early Tuesday afternoon. “Where do you stand?”
Booker’s speech is one of the longest ever given on the Senate floor. The record is held by Strom Thurmond, a South Carolina Republican who held the floor for 24 hours and 18 minutes in 1957 in protest of the Civil Rights Act. As of 4:30 p.m. — 21 hours and 30 minutes after Booker started speaking — his speech became the fourth longest ever heard in the Senate.
Booker will beat Thurmond’s record if he’s still speaking at 7:19 p.m. Tuesday. 
The senator has covered a breadth of topics: health care, Social Security, Medicaid, grocery prices, free speech, veterans, public education, world leaders, Elon Musk’s Department of Government Efficiency, and national security concerns. He read letters and comments from constituents and he quoted speeches from the late Rep. John Lewis — invoking Lewis’ famous call to action to “get in good trouble” — and the late Sen. John McCain.
Booker, a former mayor of Newark, also assailed Trump’s policies on immigration. He said the Trump administration is doing “outrageous things like disappearing people off of American streets, violating fundamental principles of this document” — here he held up a copy of the U.S. Constitution — “invoking the Alien Enemies Act from the 1700s that was last used to put Japanese Americans into internment camps.”
“Do we see what’s happening?” Booker asked.
He spent about a half-hour reading the account of Jasmine Mooney, a Canadian citizen who was detained by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement for 12 days in March. He also noted that the Trump administration conceded Monday that it deported Kilmar Abrego Garcia, a 29-year-old Maryland man with protected legal status, to an El Salvador prison because of an “administrative error.”
“The government can’t walk up to a human being and grab them off the street and put them on a plane and send them to one of the most notorious prisons in the world, and just say, as one of our authorities did, ‘Oopsie,’” Booker said. 
Sen. Chuck Schumer (D-New York), who asked about the impact of potential Medicaid cuts and tariffs about 15 hours into Booker’s speech, told Booker he has the support of the entire party.
“Your strength, your fortitude, your clarity has just been nothing short of amazing. All of America is paying attention to what you’re saying. All of America needs to know there’s so many problems — the disastrous actions of this administration in terms of how they’re helping only the billionaires and hurting average families — you have brought this forth with such clarity,” he said.

,DC,2025-04-01 21:37:59+00:00,News From The States - Fair. Fearless. Free.,"Consumers, business owners hold their breath waiting for the Trump tariffs",Ashley Murray,,,,,https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/consumers-business-owners-hold-their-breath-waiting-trump-tariffs,,"WASHINGTON — American business owners and consumers are bracing as President Donald Trump teases, with few details, the announcement of sweeping tariffs expected Wednesday afternoon.Trump has dubbed April 2 “Liberation Day,” his self-imposed deadline to fulfill his campaign promise of taxing imported products from around the globe.The White House confirmed Tuesday that Trump had made a decision on tariff levels but would not provide further details.“He's with his trade and tariff team right now perfecting it to make sure this is a perfect deal for the American people and the American worker, and you will all find out in about 24 hours from now,” press secretary Karoline Leavitt told reporters Tuesday afternoon at the daily briefing.The new tariffs come as Trump already imposed 25% duties on imported steel and aluminum, as well as 25% levies on foreign cars and vehicle parts set to begin Thursday.But the anticipation of more tariffs on numerous imported goods has stopped business owners in their tracks as uncertainty about costs and consumer reaction clouds day-to-day decisions.Stockpiling coffee cupsGabe Hagen, owner of Brick Road Coffee in Tempe, Arizona, said small business owners are feeling “whiplash.”“Are we going to have a tariff? Are we not? It's not easy for me to change my prices overnight. But at the same time, if all of the sudden I have my cost of goods going up, it'll put me into a loss territory.”Most disposable beverage cups are produced in China, so Hagen made the decision last year to purchase and store $26,000 worth of coffee cups in anticipation of tariffs.He also had to pull back $50,000 in capital for development on a second shop location, he said.“The main thing we're asking for is stability,” said Hagen, who also sits on the Small Business for America’s Future advisory council.Walt Rowen, owner and president of Susquehanna Glass Company in Columbia, Pennsylvania, said “there’s no clarity at this point at all.”“Everybody is in a holding pattern. We’re stuck wondering what is going to happen,” Rowen said. “We can sort of know that we're gonna have to increase prices if the tariffs come into effect. But what we don't know is if we increase prices, how much does that affect demand?”Rowen’s historic 1925 three-story production facility right in the middle of the southeastern Pennsylvania town employs anywhere from 35 to 65 workers, depending on the season.Through a variety of decorating techniques, his employees engrave or imprint screened paint logos, names and other messages on wine glasses he sources from a manufacturer in Italy and mugs made in Vietnam.Rowen’s production rooms buzz, especially in the months leading up to the holidays, when his employees laser engrave and hand paint personalized ornaments sourced from China for the Lenox Corporation.“My Christmas ornament business is huge for us in the fourth quarter, and I would normally be planning to bring in 20 to 30 people to work in that category of business. But if those prices increase by 30, 40, 50%, I don't know how many we're going to sell this year. So I can't even plan production. It’s frightening,” he said.States to feel economic painEconomists are warning the rollercoaster tariff policy coming from the Oval Office is undermining economic growth and trust in the U.S. as a stable trading partner.Trump told reporters as recently as Sunday that he was planning to slap tariffs on “all countries.”His administration’s mid-March levies on aluminum and steel imports sparked retaliation from the European Union and Canada, which beginning in mid-April will enforce taxes on hundreds of American products crossing their borders, including iconic Kentucky bourbon, Tennessee whiskey and Harley-Davidson motorcycles.Unless Trump carves out exceptions on certain products, more states can expect to feel economic pain, said Mary Lovely, senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics.“For example, a state like Washington state is very export dependent, not just obviously aircraft, but also apples and a wide variety of other manufacturing and agricultural (products). That state will be really hard hit if there are retaliatory tariffs, both from Canada, which is a market, but also from Asia,” Lovely said.Trump’s tariffs on products from Canada, China and Mexico could cost the typical American family at least an extra $1,200 annually in price increases, according to a report Lovely co-authored. The dollar amount increases when calculating for universal tariffs on all imported goods, and when accounting for retaliation from other countries.European Union President Ursula von der Leyen already made clear in a speech Monday that the bloc wants to negotiate with Trump but will apply more levies on American products given no other choice.“Europe has not started this confrontation. We do not necessarily want to retaliate, but we have a strong plan to retaliate if necessary,” she said.Tariffs on CanadaOn Capitol Hill, Democratic Sens. Tim Kaine and Mark Warner of Virginia and Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota introduced a resolution to block the president's tariffs on Canada, which he triggered under his emergency powers.Trump’s use of the International Emergency Economic Power Act to slap 25% tariffs on products out of Canada and Mexico marked the first time a president had ever done so.  “We think that the economic chaos that's being caused and markets being roiled and consumer confidence dropping, and some predicting recession, together with a bipartisan vote might convince the White House — ‘Hey, look, there's a better way to treat American citizens and customers,’” Kaine told reporters outside the U.S. Capitol Tuesday.Kaine said his message to Republicans is “stand up for your constituents and say no tax increase on them.”The Senate is expected to vote on the legislation late Tuesday or Wednesday.Bill Butcher, founder of Port City Brewing in Alexandria, Virginia, spoke alongside the senators Tuesday, expressing concern about the price of Canadian Pilsner malt that he’s used for 14 years.“It's a very specific strain of high quality barley that grows in the cold climate of Canada, and there's not a suitable U.S. substitute that we can get at the same quality to make our beer,” he said. “If there's a 25% tariff on this basic ingredient, it's going to slow our business down.“By the time it goes from us to our distributor to the retailer to the consumer, this $12.99 six-pack of beer is going to end up at $18.99. How many people are still going to want to buy a six-pack of great-tasting beer but at $18.99? People are going to start looking for a different substitute,” Butcher said.White House defends tariffsIn an emailed statement Tuesday to States Newsroom, White House spokesperson Kush Desai said Trump used tariffs “to deliver historic job, wage, and economic growth with no inflation in his first term, and he’s set to restore American Greatness in his second term.”“Fearmongering by the media and Democrats about President Trump’s America First economic agenda isn’t going to change the fact that industry leaders have already made trillions in investment commitments to make in America, and that countries ranging from Vietnam to India to the UK have already begun to offer up trade concessions that would help level the playing field for American industries and workers,” Desai said.Peter Navarro, Trump’s senior counselor on trade, told “Fox News Sunday with Shannon Bream” Trump’s new tariffs will raise $600 billion a year for the U.S., plus another $100 billion from the 25% duty on foreign cars that will launch this week.The government would gain that revenue from U.S. businesses who will need to pay the duty rates to get their purchased goods through the U.S. border.Erica York with the Tax Foundation, a center-right think tank that advocates for lower taxes, said Tuesday that number is “very, very wrong” because Navarro is basing the math on the current level of imports.“If we put a 20% tax on imports, people are not going to buy as many imports, so that reduces how much revenue you get,” York said. “Also, mechanically, if firms are making all of these tariff payments, that reduces their revenue. They don't have as much to pay workers (and) to return to shareholders.”U.S. stocks showed their biggest losses since 2022, according to Monday’s report on the first quarter of 2025.Both Moody’s Analytics and Goldman Sachs warned on Monday that they’ve raised their forecasts for an economic recession to 35%.",,,,2025-04-01 18:03:00.579164

(Joshua Haiar/South Dakota Searchlight)A ballot question committee is suing South Dakota’s top election official over a new law that shortens the window for petition circulation by three months.
Dakotans for Health filed the lawsuit Tuesday in federal court against Secretary of State Monae Johnson.
“This new law is just another effort to silence the voices of South Dakotans and deny them the right to make decisions that impact their lives,” said Dakotans for Health Chairman Rick Weiland in a news release.


Legislation affecting voters
Read more about election bills considered and adopted during the legislative session on South Dakota Searchlight’s 2025 Election Legislation page.


South Dakota’s Republican-dominated Legislature approved the legislation earlier this month, and Republican Gov. Larry Rhoden signed it into law last week. The law moves the filing deadline up from May to February for petitions seeking to place citizen-initiated questions on the ballot during general election years.
“It also imposes additional challenges,” Dakotans for Health said, “including harsher winter conditions and decreased voter interest due to the far-removed election date.”
Dakotans for Health is seeking a court order blocking the enforcement of the law, and the payment of its attorney fees and costs.
The law affects initiated measures, which need petition signatures from 17,508 registered South Dakota voters to make the ballot, and initiated constitutional amendments, which need 35,017 signatures. State law says no signatures may be collected more than 24 months preceding the general election.
Dakotans for Health has been active in numerous petition drives, including two last year: a constitutional amendment that would have reinstated abortion rights and an initiated measure that would have repealed the state sales tax on groceries. Voters rejected both measures.
The main sponsor of the new law, House Speaker Jon Hansen, R-Dell Rapids, helped lead a legal challenge last year against the abortion amendment. The case was scheduled for trial after the election, but the lawsuit was dismissed after voters defeated the amendment.
Hansen sent a statement in response to a message Tuesday from South Dakota Searchlight.
“Disputes over the validity of petition signatures should be decided before the election takes place — not after,” the statement said. “Amending this deadline is a common sense way to give voters the certainty to know exactly what will be on their ballot before they go to vote while still allowing over a year to gather petition signatures.”
Hansen’s legislation was one of numerous bills legislators considered to restrict citizen lawmaking. Among those that passed was a resolution that will send a question to the 2026 ballot asking voters to raise the approval threshold for constitutional amendment ballot questions from a simple majority to 60%. Lawmakers also passed but failed to override Gov. Rhoden’s veto of a bill that would have required constitutional amendment petitions to have signatures from every legislative Senate district in the state.

Republicans on the House Health Committee voted in favor of House Bill 491, which its sponsor, Rep. Donny Lambeth (R-Forsyth) described as a signal to Washington decisionmakers that state legislators support work requirements. Nearly all Democrats on the committee voted no. Rep. Carla Cunningham (D-Mecklenburg) abstained. 
Rep. Garland Pierce (D-Scotland) said after the committee meeting the bill wasn’t “fully vetted.” 
Rep. Becky Carney (D-Mecklenburg) said the bill “wasn’t ready for prime time,” though Lambeth “did what he thought was right.”
North Carolina’s 2023 Medicaid expansion law already includes a provision requiring the state Department of Health and Human Services to pursue work requirements if it seems federal administrators will allow them. The federal government sets baseline requirements for Medicaid coverage and pays most of the bill. States must ask permission before changing their Medicaid programs.

Under President Donald Trump’s first administration, state requests to impose Medicaid work requirements were approved. Courts overturned some of those approvals and President Joe Biden’s administration later rescinded others. 
Congressional budget-cutters are now considering work requirements as a way to save money in the Medicaid program. Along with work requirements and other cuts, Congressional Republicans are also considering a reduction in the 90% in funding support the federal government currently provides to states for people covered under Medicaid expansion.
North Carolina’s Medicaid expansion law includes a trigger that would end Medicaid expansion, which would withdraw health insurance from more than 600,000 people, if the federal government’s support falls below 90%. None of the money for people insured under Medicaid expansion comes from state coffers. 
Lambeth’s bill requires the state Department of Health and Human Services to tell the legislature how much money is needed to implement a work requirement and says it would be imposed regardless of another state law on income thresholds and eligibility categories. 
“It basically reiterates what the current expansion bill already says, signaling to the folks in Washington we’d be supportive of that if we got to that point,” Lambeth told the committee. 
“I’m hoping by signaling we’re okay with a work requirement, they will get off the idea of changing our funding formula. If the funding formula is changed, even a small tenth of a percent, one percent, it is a major impact to North Carolina, and we hope we don’t have to go down that path.” Lambeth has stated previously that a reduction in federal support would be “a disaster.”
Rep. Sarah Crawford (D-Wake) co-sponsored a bill that would get rid of the trigger. Under that bill, Medicaid expansion in North Carolina would be spared if the federal government’s financial support falls below 90%.
Crawford voted against the work requirement bill.
 A failed experiment in other states

“There is no evidence that work requirements actually increase work participation,” Crawford said after the committee meeting. Most adults who use Medicaid as their insurance and are able to work already do. “About eight percent of people on Medicaid who are able to work are not working, so it’s a relatively small number of people. Those individuals typically have a number of barriers to employment that include a whole host of things — where they live, their health, access to transportation. All that we’ve seen in the past, when other states have tried to implement work requirements, it actually leads to be people being left without coverage.”
Arkansas imposed a Medicaid work requirement for less than a year in 2018 before a judge ended it. About 18,000 people lost their health insurance, according to a study, and the work requirement did not lead to increased employment. Arkansans were not able to report their work hours due to lack of internet access, didn’t know about the requirement, or didn’t think it applied to them, a 2019 study said.
Stateline reported Tuesday that between 4.6 million and 5.2 million adults ages 19 to 55 could lose their health care coverage under an emerging congressional Republican plan to impose Medicaid work requirements nationwide.
 A necessity to gain Republican support
Lambeth said after the meeting that the work requirement would cover people who gained insurance under Medicaid expansion. In that case, people with disabilities who are insured under special Medicaid programs would be exempt. 
Lambeth worked for years to extend Medicaid coverage to more adults, and for a long time he was one of the few Republicans in the legislature openly supporting it. He sponsored bills that were precursors to the 2023 Medicaid expansion law that included work requirements. 
Including the requirement for at least 90% federal funding in the 2023 expansion law was one of the conditions for winning greater Republican support, he said. 
“The only way we got that bill approved was to have triggers in there,” Lambeth said. The 90% trigger and work requirements were necessary to “cobble together enough Republican votes.”",https://ncnewsline.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Medicaid-2048x1366-1-1024x683.jpeg,,,2025-04-01 18:03:00.579164

(John Hult/South Dakota Searchlight)SIOUX FALLS — The South Dakota Division of Criminal Investigation is looking into a fight at the maximum security wing of the state prison in Sioux Falls that broke out less than 48 hours before a planned tour of the building by a 22-member prison work group.
It’s unclear how many people were involved, how long the fighting took place before being brought under control, or how badly anyone was hurt. 
Staff “contained” the fight, and no one’s life is in danger as a result of their injuries, the Department of Corrections said. 
“That incident is under investigation. DCI has been notified of the fight,” spokesman Michael Winder wrote in an email to South Dakota Searchlight.
Work group aims to ditch baggage, find solutions in prison talks

The Project Prison Reset work group is set to convene at 8 a.m. Wednesday for tours of the South Dakota State Penitentiary and Jameson Annex. It’s the first portion of a two-day meeting that also includes public presentations and public comments on Thursday at the Military Heritage Alliance in Sioux Falls.
The group’s mission is to find consensus on whether the state needs new prison facilities. Gov. Larry Rhoden appointed lawmakers, law enforcement representatives, a judge and other stakeholders to the group in late February, after the Legislature shot down an attempt to finalize funding for a proposed 1,500-bed men’s prison in Lincoln County. Had it been approved, the $825 million prison campus would have been the most expensive taxpayer-funded building project in state history. It was meant to largely replace the penitentiary, a pre-statehood complex built in 1881.
The work group will tour the Lincoln County site, located 14 miles south of Sioux Falls, at 2 p.m. Wednesday.
Details unclear in Monday violence
The Monday fighting broke out in the Jameson Annex, a building erected in 1993 that was home to 473 inmates as of Feb. 28. In addition to housing the state’s highest-security inmates, Jameson has the Sioux Falls prison complex’s administrative segregation and mental health units and intake unit. All men admitted to the DOC for any level of crime spend time in the intake “fish tank” to be assessed before being assigned a cell in one of the state’s various housing facilities. 
Wealth of controversies, outbreaks of violence spark questions on prison oversight

The Jameson Annex remains on lockdown status after the fight, Winder said Tuesday. He did not say if any correctional officers were among the injured, if any of the injured were transported to the hospital for care, or note which area or areas of the facility where the fight occurred. 
Winder did not say if the ongoing investigation would keep members of the prison task force out of the building, and did not immediately respond to follow-up questions on the matter.
Tony Mangan, spokesman for the Division of Criminal Investigation, said the agency will work to determine the number of people involved and how the incident began. 
“The investigation is ongoing,” Mangan said.
Attorney General Marty Jackley, who oversees the DCI, is a member of the prison work group, but he won’t be on hand for its first meeting. He’s in Pierre this week for the trial of Lonna Carroll, a former Department of Social Services employee accused of embezzling from the state. 
Recent history of security trouble
The state’s prison system has struggled with a host of security incidents since March of 2024. Two days of unrest broke out at the penitentiary following the temporary shutdown of tablet-based inmate communications with family members that month. One correctional officer was injured in the first of those incidents.
A few months later, fighting broke out at Mike Durfee State Prison in Springfield, which required outside medical care for some inmate victims. Prisoners called out to reporters the following day to express their worries of further violence.
Near the end of the summer, the DOC announced an indefinite lockdown at the penitentiary for what turned out to be a weekslong lockdown in search of contraband. Officers dismantled the campus sweat lodges during the search. After the lockdown ended, Corrections Secretary Kellie Wasko showed lawmakers images of knives fashioned from nail files and Plexiglas, a tattoo gun, mobile Wi-Fi hotspots and bags of homemade alcohol.
During debate on the Lincoln County prison proposal, last year and this year, Wasko argued that the penitentiary is unsafe and unsuited for continued use as offender housing.

But last week the Trump administration abruptly ended the payments a year earlier than expected.

His call to action comes after U.S. Secretary of Education Linda McMahon notified state education departments on March 28 that they no longer had another year, as expected, to spend COVID funds and that the U.S. Education Department (USED) was immediately halting nearly $3 billion in COVID-relief fund reimbursements.
McMahon said the Education Department would consider extending the deadline for spending the money on “an individual project-specific basis.”

Fletcher wrote in his Tuesday letter that after the federal department changed how states could request COVID relief funds in February, the Kentucky Department of Education (KDE) “has not received COVID grant funding the next business day as was previously the case” and was paying “district grant recipients and asking the federal government to reimburse us.” 
“At this point in time, we have asked to be reimbursed for nearly $5 million, with no response from USED,” Fletcher said. 
“This latest message from USED will harm a variety of our schools and districts across the state even more. KDE and/or our school districts have already committed or spent these funds because we were promised a liquidation period ending March 2026.”
Fletcher said 19 districts asked for an extension to fully spend their COVID relief dollars totaling $84.1 million. Thirteen districts have $34 million remaining “that should be accessible to spend for the benefit of students, primarily on construction projects or bus purchases” before the original deadline of March 2026.
Shortening the fund liquidation date by a year “leaves our districts and KDE in a difficult position,” Fletcher said. 
Some of the projects that are now in jeopardy include providing educational technology services to public schools, including online school registration services and e-transcript services for high school seniors. The state has also used COVID funding for programs to help students make up for  learning loss outside of regular school hours. 
Fletcher ended the letter encouraging superintendents and other stakeholders to contact their federal legislators, along with contact information for the offices of each member of Kentucky’s congressional delegation. 
“Take the time to explain to our federal legislators how the sudden change in the liquidation deadline for COVID relief funds by the U.S. Department of Education will negatively impact our schools and districts, particularly the most vulnerable populations in the Commonwealth,” Fletcher wrote. 
The pause in COVID funding reimbursements comes days after President Donald Trump signed an executive order directing McMahon to close the U.S. Education Department.",https://kentuckylantern.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/hs-classroom-1024x683.jpeg,,,2025-04-01 17:07:06.214395

The bill nixes tax increases proposed by Ohio Gov. Mike DeWine on gambling, cigarettes, and marijuana.
Ohio House Finance Committee Chairman Rep. Brian Stewart, R-Ashville, said lawmakers worked through nearly 3,000 amendments to get the current draft. He expects to see additional tweaks before the chamber votes.
The House budget proposal charts a different course than DeWine’s version in several key areas, but the debate is far from done. In the coming weeks, Ohio Senators will take a crack at it and the governor, who has a line-item veto, will get the final say on what expenditures go forward.
Lawmakers and the governor face a July 1 deadline.
Where the House differs

DeWine’s proposal clocked in at $218 billion over two years, with proposed tax increases on gambling, marijuana, and cigarettes. DeWine envisioned a fund for stadium improvements underwritten by gambling receipts, and a $1,000 refundable child tax credit funded by cigarette taxes.
Tax-averse Republicans in the House turned him down.
“There are no tax increases in this budget,” Stewart explained. “We are not raising taxes on sports betting, marijuana or tobacco products. If there was a tax credit program that was tied to those tax increases, we have not included that in this budget either.”
Ohio Gov. DeWine emphasizes workforce, child care programs in State of the State address

While the child tax credit is gone, Stewart did lay out a $10 million child care cost-sharing pilot. The program borrows from an idea called tri-share which splits the cost between employers, employees and the state.
“There’s a bill that would say, make it a third, a third and a third,” Stewart explained. “We’re trying to be a little more fiscally responsible and say, well, let’s make the state’s third maybe more like 20% and see how it goes.”
And instead of establishing a long-term funding source for all future stadium projects, Stewart said House leaders are OK with an ad hoc approach.
The Cleveland Browns want $600 million in state-backed bonds for a new stadium in Brook Park, and House Republicans are on board. Stewart compared the stadium deal to spending lawmakers regularly approve in the capital budget.
“This is obviously a bigger project than a splash pad in Circleville,” he said, “but it’s the same kind of concept.”
A sports facilities deals expert has warned that the projections by the Browns for revenue to repay the bonds are “way too optimistic,” reports the Statehouse News Bureau.
The budget from 30,000 feet
The House will keep the governor’s updates to the merit scholarship program — “maybe my favorite part of the proposal,” Stewart said — which give the top 5% of a high school’s class guaranteed admission at state schools. Those students can also get up to $5,000 each year for four years if they study in-state.
State university funding will get a 2% bump under the House plan, and tuition increases would be capped at 3% a year for the next two years.
Public libraries would see their funding model change. Instead of a dedicated percentage of the general revenue fund, the House proposes putting a dollar figure on their appropriation: $485 million in the 2026 fiscal year and $495 million in the next.
House lawmakers are also attempting to include provisions requiring “material related to sexual orientation or gender identity or expression” be kept in an area away from minors.
Perhaps the most significant move comes from the House plan to rein in property taxes.
“Ohio’s public school districts had a carry-over cash balance of $10.5 billion at the end of the last fiscal year,” Stewart said. And although a rainy-day fund is a good idea, he argued 528 of the state’s 609 districts are carrying over 25% or more of their operating budget. Public school funding comes from property taxes and the House budget proposes capping school district carry-over at 25% to provide “immediate relief” to taxpayers.
“We believe that those monies are better in the taxpayers pocket than in the school district’s bank account just accumulating,” Stewart argued.
School districts will receive more funding than they did in the prior fiscal year, but nowhere near as much as they expected — a point which Democrats were quick to criticize.
In a statement, Minority Leader Allison Russo argued property tax relief is “overdue” but “Ohioans deserve a budget that benefits our children by properly funding public education.”

(File) 
A federal judge has dismissed a lawsuit challenging the security of Georgia’s electronic voting machines even though the judge maintained substantial concerns about the system.
According to U.S. District Court Judge Amy Totenberg ruling issued Monday, the plaintiffs in Curling v Raffensperger are not able to demonstrate that the state’s electronic voting system disenfranchises them from exercising their right to vote in elections.
She wrote that the election activists Coalition for Good Governance and Georgia voters lacked standing in the lawsuit.
Totenberg also wrote that some of the plaintiffs legal objections to the touchscreen ballot marking devices are more about policy disagreements rather than constitutional violations.
Totenberg, however, wrote that she has substantial concerns about the electronic voting technology that has long faced allegations about the risks of being hacked and potentially compromising elections in Georgia.
The state’s electronic Dominion Voting Systems machines were rolled out statewide in 2019, but by that time the state was already involved in the pre-emptive federal court legal battle with the Coalition for Good Governance and other individual plaintiffs who claim that the electronic system is vulnerable to cyber attack and operational problems that violate voters’ constitutional rights.
Totenberg credited the plaintiff’s role in providing evidence that exposed a major breach of election equipment in Coffee County following the 2020 election.
Also, she cited a report by a University of Michigan expert on cyber security that detailed the potential threats to ballot marking devices, as well as the possibility that future elections could be compromised by unauthorized access to voter data.
Republican Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger applauded Totenberg’s ruling in the District Court for Northern District of Georgia case. Raffensperger has long defended the security of Dominion voting machines, arguing that there is no evidence of fraud affecting Georgia’s 2020 and 2024 presidential election results.
“Today’s ruling is just one more resounding vindication of Georgia’s elections,” Raffensperger said. “From day one, we knew these accusations were meritless. All the real-world evidence shows that Georgia’s paper ballot system works well. Our local election officials are professionals. And the voters of this state know that their votes are counted securely, accurately, and quickly.”
Paper ballots movement
The Coalition for Good Governance has long argued that Georgia elections should use hand-marked ballots, claiming that method is the safest way to vote.
The debate over electronic voting machines versus paper ballots was the focus of conspiracy theorists who blamed Dominion’s system for Republican President Donald Trump’s loss to Joe Biden in 2020. Conspiracies about the Dominion machines swirled after Fox News settled a lawsuit with the voting machine maker over the network’s false reports about the system’s reliability.
Over the last couple of years, a prominent pro-paper ballot movement has been led by VoterGa, a largely pro-Trump faction that has urged people to request that state officials get rid of the electronic voting system.
Totenberg wrote Monday that the case has led to some Georgia legislative action that assuaged some of her concerns, such as the Dominion machines relying on use of QR codes for counting votes on paper ballots, a practice that has been criticized by ballot security advocates.
Last year the Georgia Legislature approved Senate Bill 189, which calls for replacing the QR code by July 1, 2026 with a new method of either readable text or a bubble style mark similar to what is currently used for absentee and provisional ballots.
Next year, the paper ballots movement could gain traction in the  Legislature through Senate Bill 214,  which would allow Georgia voters to cast a hand-marked paper ballot at polling places during early voting and on Election Day. The measure, which was approved last week by a Senate Ethics Committee, would give voters the ability to cast their votes in polling places using pen or pencils, which can now be used to complete absentee ballots. This year is the first in a two-year cycle and bills that don’t pass this year will be alive in 2026.
“Although the plaintiffs have not prevailed in this court of law, their advocacy has helped spark real legislative action,” Totenberg wrote.
“If (SB 189) legislative measures are ultimately funded and implemented, they are the type of legislative action that bolster public confidence in the management of Georgia’s voting system,” Totenberg wrote. “Through litigation and other means, plaintiffs no doubt played a part in prompting these changes.”

(Photo by Jay Waagmeester/Florida Phoenix)A Florida House committee approved a bill to eliminate key child labor protections, in the measure’s first sign of life in the chamber. 
A similar bill passed a Senate committee last week to the dismay of critics worried that the measure would allow 16- and 17-year-olds to work longer hours, as well as 14- and 15-year-olds who receive permission from their school superintendent or are home schooled or enrolled in online school. 
Florida Senate committee votes to repeal child labor restrictions

The House bill would remove Florida child labor protections by allowing minors to work more than 30 hours per week during the school year; work more than eight hours in a day without a 30-minute break; and work more than eight hours the day before a school day.
Rep. Monique Miller, a Republican representing part of Brevard County, is leading the bill through the House, which is similar to Sen. Jay Collins’ version in the Senate, including two amendments made Tuesday in the House. Collins represents part of Hillsborough County.
As amended, the House bill, HB 1225, now would prevent students from working overnight before school days. The original filed bill, along with Collins’ existing language, axes a state law cutting off minors’ workdays at 11 p.m. The House amendment now proposes cutting off work before a school day at 10 p.m.  
The other amendment, Miller said, was to include a request from former Sen. Randy Fine, on behalf of his son David, to enable 13-year-olds to work during the summer during the year they turn 14. 
Regardless of Florida law, employers have to abide by federal minor employment regulations, particularly the Fair Labor Standards Act, which mostly prohibits 13-year-olds from working in jobs outside of agriculture. 
“Because federal law says that children cannot work under age 14 except in agricultural settings, this amendment only serves to change the age a Florida child can work on a farm from 14 to 13,” Florida Policy Institute CEO Sadaf Knight said in a news release. 
“This alarming development seemingly looks to our youngest teens to fill an agricultural labor shortage gap. If lawmakers truly prioritize the health, safety, and education of Florida youth, they will reject any further undoing of child labor protections in our state.”
Last week, before the amendment reinstating a prohibition for overnight work was filed, House Speaker Daniel Perez said he had “personal concerns” with the bill and that he has “been kind of going back and forth.”
Rep. Michele Rayner argued that some children lack  guardians who might protect them against exploitation, while Rep. Yvonne Hinson said she’s concerned the bill is not considerate of educational outcomes. 
“I really have a problem with this, because the unintended consequence could potentially be exploitation of our children,” Rep. Angie Nixon said.
As for potential pressure from employers  to work excessive hours, “God gave us a great barrier for that, and that is parents. Parents can definitely oversee what children are allowed to do,” Miller said. 
However, she confirmed there was no provision in the bill addressing parental rights for employed minors.

DeSantis comment
Democrats and some public speakers referenced comments from Gov. Ron DeSantis two weeks ago, when he said, “Why do we say that we need to import foreigners, even import them illegally, when, you know, teenagers used to work at these resorts, college students should be able to do this stuff.”
Miller and Collins both deflected that the governor’s comments addressed a labor shortfall amid stricter immigration enforcement and instead talked about how minors benefit from having a job. 
Miller said the bill is “giving them the opportunity to be productive citizens when they graduate.”
The bill passed the subcommittee 12-6.
The no-votes came from Democrats joined by GOP Rep. Susan Valdes, who switched her party affiliation from Democrat to Republican before this session.
The bill is assigned to two additional committees — Intergovernmental Affairs and Commerce. 
“I’m once again here speaking on behalf of our students who are currently in class trying to get their education, trying to move forward, and they cannot be here to speak to all of you as adults that are putting their lives at risk, in jeopardy,” Laura Muñoz, civic engagement director with Florida Student Power, said during public testimony on the bill. 
The meeting was attended by several youth advocates from Minds Without Borders, Youth Action Fund, and Florida Student Power Network.

According to the letter, about 30,000 federal employees live and work in New Mexico. But the federal government, in several waves of attempted mass firings since President Donald Trump took office in January, has refused to provide updates about how many of them have been fired, placed on leave or accepted deferred resignations. 
“The Administration’s executive overreach could cripple federal agencies, including in critical areas of disaster preparedness, public health, public safety, and national security,” the letter says. 
The letter asks OPM Acting Director Charles Ezell to provide detailed information about how many personnel in New Mexico have been affected by the federal cuts. 
According to the Department of Workforce Solutions, 29,630 employees work in buildings owned by the federal government. A little more than 15% of all employees in rural Catron and Hidalgo Counties, for example, work in federally owned facilities. 
A large proportion of Hidalgo County residents work for United States Customs and Border Protection, and a large proportion of Catron County residents work for the United States Forest Service, according to economic base analyses from New Mexico State University. 
The state data says that just 277 employees in Los Alamos County work in federally owned buildings. A DWS spokesperson did not respond to a Source New Mexico inquiry about why that number appeared to be so low, given the vast Los Alamos National Laboratory.
Regardless, cuts have affected numerous federal agencies with big footprints in New Mexico. Dozens of probationary Forest Service employees, for example, have been fired, only to be brought back for a court order and then placed on leave. Congressional staffers in a recent meeting about the upcoming wildfire season described “stonewalling” by Forest Service leaders on the question of how many people were fired.

Specifically, the letter seeks the following information from OPM by April 14:

The number of federal employees in New Mexico who have been fired, taken early retirement, placed on leave or been subject to a “reduction in force” since Jan. 20, 2025. The letter seeks that information broken down by agency, county, congressional level, paygrade and veteran status.
A “detailed” plan explaining how OPM will work with agencies and the state government to ensure force reductions don’t delay or disrupt programs like Medicare, Medicaid and Social Security.

(Skylar Laird/SC Daily Gazette)COLUMBIA — Amid state Board of Education members’ misgivings about its own regulation banning “sexual conduct” from K-12 public schools, the board held off on deciding Tuesday whether to remove 10 more books from school library shelves.
The state board unanimously approved the regulation last year, sending it to the state Legislature. Neither the House nor Senate took a vote on the regulation, which automatically went into effect last June through an apparent fluke that surprised even legislators.
Since the state board’s first review in November, board members have agreed to remove 11 books from public school libraries and keep six others, one of which the board required parental permission to check out. Last month, a five-member committee unanimously recommended removing the 10 books up for consideration.

But ahead of taking a vote Tuesday, board members began to question their own regulation, including whether they had applied it correctly in the past. Many of their questions echoed concerns opponents of the complaint have raised.
“I’m not sure if we’re shooting at the right target, or if we’re shooting whether our range finder is accurate,” said board member David O’Shields, superintendent of Laurens County School District 56.
The first seven books considered didn’t come from a parent challenging a local district’s ruling but by board members working with state Department of Education staff. Board members wanted to consider some widely questioned books to set a precedent for future rulings and hopefully clear up confusion, members said at the time.
Since then, most of the books removed from school libraries, including the 10 up for consideration Tuesday, came to the state board through challenges from one Beaufort County parent. The same parent brought 96 books to the Beaufort County Board of Education for review last year.
The local school board, which considered all the books before the statewide regulation went into effect, declined to remove any of the books from shelves. The same parent could feasibly ask the state board to consider every one of those books under the regulation, said board member Ken Richardson, former chairman of the Horry Georgetown Technical College board.
“When does this thing stop?” Richardson, who represents Horry and Georgetown counties, asked repeatedly.
10 more books recommended for removal in SC from K-12 libraries

“I think that’s the question of the day,” replied board Chairwoman Rita Allison, a former longtime legislator from Spartanburg County.
Board members raised concerns over a single parent being able to bring dozens of requests to the state board, requiring schools across the state to remove them from library shelves, whether or not local community members share the concerns about the books. O’Shields, Allison and Richardson said they had yet to hear complaints about any of the books they had considered in the districts they represented.
“I do not like to come up here every single meeting and vote on books nobody in my area is even talking about,” Richardson said.
Five of the 10 books up for consideration Tuesday are in school libraries in Laurens County School District 56, where O’Shields in superintendent, he said.
Libraries bought those books with the hopes that they would encourage more students to read, while “understanding that children don’t come from a cookie cutter world,” O’Shields said. He questioned whether the board should be considering books as a whole, instead of based on excerpts containing sexual conduct.
In some cases, the sexual conduct that leads the board to remove books from shelves amounts to as little as a few pages in several-hundred-page novels, he said.
“Again, I am not in favor of it,” O’Shields said. “I personally find those pages repugnant.”
But those books can still be important for some students, he said. O’Shields held up a small, yellow tome entitled “Everything You Always Wanted to Know About Sex* (*But Were Afraid to Ask),” which he deemed his own “puberty book” — the book to which he turned to learn about the changes happening in his adolescence.
“However, this was all I had. You know what I’m saying?” he continued.
For children who have experienced abuse or other struggles, reading stories similar to their own might be especially important, said Tony Vincent, a minister in Seneca. While he wouldn’t be comfortable with his preteen daughters reading some of the books up for review, he also understood that every child is different, he said.
The books “could possibly save lives and help young people understand themselves and their experiences,” said Vincent, who represents Anderson and Oconee counties.
SC teachers say new ‘age-appropriate’ rule is causing confusion. They’re seeking clear guidance.

“Looking at these books outside of the arc of their full stories is a mistake, in my view,” Vincent said.
The board originally approved the regulation in order to protect children from nefarious people looking to introduce them to sexual ideas with the intention of abusing them, said Richard Harrington, who represents Florence and Marion counties. He acknowledged that he didn’t know whether that was actually happening in South Carolina schools, but out of an abundance of caution, the board should continue to remove books that include sexual conduct, he said.
“It would be ill-advised to have these books remain when they could be used for that purpose,” Harrington said.
O’Shields and Vincent asked whether the board could consider a middle ground between removing the books from shelves entirely and allowing any student to access them. The board has already done something similar once, by requiring parental permission to check out “Crank” by Ellen Hopkins.
“I’m asking for something so it’s not, ‘goodnight, sweet prince,’ for these books,” O’Shields said.
The board voted to postpone a decision on the 10 books up for consideration Tuesday until members can get more clarification on the regulation in hopes of assuaging some of their concerns or determining whether the regulation needs any changes.
The next time the board could take a vote would be at its May 6 meeting.",https://scdailygazette.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/IMG_3297-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-04-01 17:07:06.214395

Cooper Jo Frederick, who was previously arrested by Loveland police and charged with multiple felonies under Colorado state law, was taken into custody in Texas after a federal investigation, U.S. Attorney General Pam Bondi said in a video posted to social media Monday evening.
Frederick is accused of igniting an unspecified “incendiary device” near the Loveland Tesla building, which started a small fire “between two vehicles” that was extinguished by a responding officer, according to the Loveland Police Department’s account of the incident.

In the federal indictment, filed on March 27 by the U.S. Attorney’s Office in Denver, Frederick was charged with one count of possessing a “destructive device” and one count of attempting to “damage and destroy, by means of fire and explosive materials, vehicles used in interstate or foreign commerce.”
Bondi called the incident part of “a wave of domestic terrorism against Tesla properties.” Elon Musk, the electric car company’s CEO and the world’s richest person, has been the target of nationwide protests for his extraordinary involvement in President Donald Trump’s 2024 campaign and the early actions taken by his administration, including the so-called Department of Government Efficiency and its spree of mass firings and attempted agency shutdowns.
The March 7 fire at the Loveland Tesla location followed at least three other instances of attempted arson or vandalism at the same property this year, according to police. Dozens of similar incidents have been reported across the country and even in other countries around the world. Trump’s Department of Justice last week launched a task force to investigate the incidents.
Frederick’s indictment indicates that federal prosecutors will move to keep him in pretrial detention and seek a prison sentence of up to 20 years if convicted.
“All of these cases are a serious threat to public safety,” Bondi said. “Therefore, there will be no negotiation.”

(Stock photo by Getty Images)Distracted driving incidents led to the deaths of more than 3,000 Americans in 2022, according to data collected by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration.
In hopes of reducing those corresponding statistics in Florida, individuals and families who have lost loved ones to distracted driving incidents have galvanized this year behind bipartisan legislation that would ban drivers from operating a motor vehicle while using a cellphone in a handheld manner.
The Senate version (SB 1318), sponsored by Southeast Florida Republican Erin Grall, would expand the existing prohibition on texting while driving to include “using, while driving, a wireless communications device in a handheld manner except to activate, deactivate, initiate, or terminate a feature or function of the device, including a hands-free accessory.”
It passed in the Senate Rules Committee on Tuesday, and now will go the Senate floor for final passage.
It’s another story in the House, however. It’s version (HB 501), sponsored by North Florida Democrat Allison Tant, has gone nowhere to date, and advocates are concerned that another year will go without doing anything to change driver behavior when it comes to our obsession with not being able to look at our phone for 10 minutes.
“The public wants and expects these common-sense laws to pass, and not even allowing it a hearing or the public a voice in this debate is not right,” said Jennifer Smith with StopDistractions.org, a nonprofit group made up of families who have been harmed by distracted driving.
So far, the legislation’s trajectory has been the exact opposite of what occurred last session. That’s when a version of Tant’s bill won approval in three House committees before dying on the floor, while its Senate companion never was heard in committee.
Other states continue to act. Last week, the Iowa Senate passed a bill expanding an existing ban on texting while driving to cover any handheld use of a cellphone, with the measure now headed to Gov. Kim Reynolds’ desk. Once it is signed, Iowa will become the 32nd state to adopt such laws.

It took years for Florida to pass a texting-while-driving law during the last decade, and it took Michigan five years to pass a hands-free law, said Steve Kiefer, whose son Mitchel was killed in 2016 at 18 by a driver who was on Snapchat when she rear-ended him. He now runs the Kiefer Foundation, dedicated to ending distracted driving, from his home in Naples.
“Police officers want laws that they can enforce, and hands-free laws are really the only law that we know that will make it very visual,” he said.
That sentiment was shared by William B. Smith, a state trooper from Miami, when speaking at the Senate Appropriations Committee on Transportation, Tourism, and Economic Development last week. “It is a problem. Distracted driving is a current problem and it will continue to be problem as long as we don’t pay attention … to what we’re doing when we’re driving a 6,000 pound killing machine,” he said.
Stalled in the House
Tant’s bill has landed in two House committees, starting with the Government Operations Subcommittee, chaired by Pinellas County Republican Linda Chaney, as well State Affairs, chaired by Manatee County Republican Will Robinson. Neither returned requests for comment.
The legislation would “authorize law officers to stop motor vehicles and issue citations to persons who are using wireless communications devices in a handheld manner while driving.”
That concerns GOP Sen. Tom Leek, who said while discussing Grall’s bill last week in the committee hearing that while he voted to advance the measure, he struggled with “giving the ability of a government actor to pull you over for doing something that is entirely legal, like holding a telephone.”
But Kiefer blasts that take.
“He was basically saying, ‘It’s a primary offense to hold a phone. Something that is absolutely legal to do,'” said Kiefer.
“If I was in the room, I would have pointed it out to him that it’s also legal to drink, and it’s even legal to be drunk in your home, but it’s not legal to drink and drive in a car where you’re going to harm other people,” he said. “So, I think it’s just very uninformed politicians that don’t really understand what the law would do and how effective it has been in every other state.”
During Tuesday’s meeting, GOP senators Jonathan Martin and Blaise Ingoglia were the only members of the committee to oppose the measure. Both said that they thought it was too incremental, and didn’t go far enough in terms of attacking all distracted driving.
“If we were going to crackdown on distracted driving, we would be including things like shaving, which we’ve all seen,” Ingoglia said. “Doing makeup in your vehicle. Eating while driving. Those are all distractions. Anything that takes somebody’s attention off of the road into something else in the vehicle should be a form of distracted driving, and it should be dealt with as such.”
Leon County resident Christopher Chapman, who testified earlier in the meeting to describe how life has been much tougher for him after he was injured by a distracted driver, shook his head while listening to Ingoglia’s and Martin’s quibbles.
“I will agree that this bill is imperfect, but it’s the bill that we have in front of us,” he told the Phoenix following the meeting. “And it does give us a platform to build upon where we can invoke more stringent requirements or more stringent penalties.”
Change of Heart

In January, he publicly confronted Pinellas County Republican Sen. Nick DiCeglie for his failure to agenda the bill in a committee he chaired last year. The two had words after the meeting, and DiCeglie said he wasn’t happy with Branca calling him out.
But in Tuesday’s committee, DiCeglie said his conversation with Branca changed his attitude on the issue.
‘I tried to take the emotion out of it,” DiCeglie told Branca. “I looked at the statistics. I  looked at the data, and I looked at what 31 other states did. And I thought of you and I thought of your son Anthony.”
“I’m proud that you’re standing here in front of us today telling your story,” DiCeglie added. “That has translated into what I believe is good public policy, and I think that’s going to translate into saving lives. And regardless of what happens this point forward, I  think that you can look yourself in the mirror and know that you did what was right in your heart.”
If Tant’s bill doesn’t get heard soon in the House, such legislation is likely dead for 2025, something Kiefer says will be an irresponsible decision by lawmakers.
“It took us five years to get it done in Michigan,” he acknowledged. “We’ve got people playing politics in the House and they won’t hear it in the subcommittees, which of course will block it.”

Jacksonville Democratic Sen. Tracie Davis revealed during Tuesday’s committee meeting that her sister was killed by a distracted driver while jogging in Tallahassee. Although the proposal doesn’t address the entire problem, she said, it is a necessary first step.
“Colleagues, we need your help in ensuring that the House chamber understands how important this is as well,” she said.
Grall ended her close on the bill Tuesday by getting intensely personal with her colleagues.
“If it’s not your family who has someone taken from you, what if it’s you who takes someone from someone else? How will you carry that with you? We must change our behavior. This is to me is not acceptable any longer. If we can’t be examples from this chamber, with this legislature, then we have a problem.”

U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement and the Department of Justice admitted in separate court filings that his deportation to the brutal prison, Centro de Confinamiento del Terrorismo, or CECOT, was an “administrative error.""""This was an oversight, and the removal was carried out in good faith based on the existence of a final order of removal and Abrego-Garcia’s purported membership in MS-13,"" ICE Acting Field Office Director of Enforcement and Removal Operations Robert L. Cerna wrote in a Monday court filing.Simon Y. Sandoval-Moshenberg, the attorney for Abrego Garcia, is requesting a preliminary injunction from the U.S. District Court of Maryland, which would require the Trump administration to make a request to the government of El Salvador for Abrego Garcia to be returned to U.S. custody.The lawyer also wants a halt to U.S. payments to the government of El Salvador for detaining his client at the ""notorious CECOT torture prison.""A hearing is set for 1 p.m. Eastern Friday before U.S. District Judge Paula Xinis. She was appointed by former President Barack Obama in 2016.Press secretary defends decisionWhite House press secretary Karoline Leavitt Tuesday said that Abrego Garcia was a leader of the MS-13 gang, despite his deportation being ""a clerical error.""""The administration maintains the position that this individual who was deported to El Salvador and will not be returning to our country was a member of the brutal and vicious MS-13 gang,"" she said.She said the U.S. Department of Homeland Security has evidence of his gang activity that she has seen and she also alleged that Abrego Garcia was involved in human trafficking.Sandoval-Moshenberg, the attorney for Abrego Garcia, has denied his involvement in any gangs, noting he has no criminal charges or convictions in the United States, El Salvador or any other country.""Abrego Garcia is not a member of or has no affiliation with Tren de Aragua, MS-13, or any other criminal or street gang. Although he has been accused of general 'gang affiliation,' the U.S. government has never produced an iota of evidence to support this unfounded accusation,"" according to court filings.Leavitt also dismissed the 2019 order from an immigration judge granting Abrego Garcia protections from removal.Federal law bars the removal of an individual if they will face persecution, known as a ""withholding of removal."" Because of this condition, Abrego Garcia was required to check in with ICE each year, which he has complied with since 2019, according to court filings.""Who does that judge work for? It was an immigration judge who works for the Department of Justice at the direction of the attorney general of the United States, whose name is Pam Bondi, who has committed to eradicating MS-13 from our nation's interior,"" Leavitt said.Leavitt said that 17 more men were deported to CECOT Monday. The U.S. is paying El Salvador's government $6 million to detain all those deported there.Identified from news storyAbrego Garcia, who is married to a U.S. citizen with whom he has a child, was detained by ICE on March 12 while driving with his 5-year-old son near Baltimore, Maryland. He was informed by ICE officials that his ""status had changed,"" according to court filings.Abrego Garcia's wife, Jennifer Vasquez Sura, ""was called and instructed to appear at their location within ten minutes to get her five-year old son, A.A.V.; otherwise, the ICE officers threatened that the child would be handed over to Child Protective Services.""Vasquez Sura tried to call the ICE facility that her husband was transferred to and inform officials that he could not be sent back to El Salvador.""Her attempts to protest by saying that he had won protection from being removed to El Salvador fell on deaf ears,"" according to court filings.Within three days, he would become one of the 261 men on one of three deportation flights to CECOT in El Salvador, despite a temporary restraining order in place from a district court judge from the District of Columbia that applied generally to all the deportations.Vasquez Sura was able to identify him from a news article when a photo showed men sent to the prison with their heads shaved and arms over their necks. She recognized her husband's scar on his head and his tattoo.DOJ argumentsDepartment of Justice attorneys, on behalf of the Trump administration, argued that the district court in Maryland lacks jurisdiction because Abrego Garcia is no longer in U.S. custody and his lawyers have not shown it is likely he could be returned.""There is no showing that any payment made to El Salvador is yet to occur; no showing that El Salvador is likely to release CECOT detainees but for any such payment; no showing that El Salvador is even inclined to consider a request to release a detainee at the United States’ request,"" according to the DOJ filing.The Department of Justice also argues that his attorney has ""not clearly shown a likelihood that Abrego Garcia will be tortured or killed in CECOT.""""While there may be allegations of abuses in other Salvadoran prisons—very few in relation to the large number of detainees—there is no clear showing that Abrego Garcia himself is likely to be tortured or killed in CECOT,"" according to DOJ.The Department of Justice said the district court should defer to the Trump administration's determination ""that Abrego Garcia will not likely be tortured or killed in El Salvador.""""Although the government erred in removing Abrego Garcia specifically to El Salvador, the government would not have removed any alien to El Salvador for detention in CECOT if it believed that doing so would violate the United States’ obligations under the Convention (Against Torture),"" according to DOJ.",,,,2025-04-01 17:07:06.214395

The latest iteration of the battle is contained in SB 172, a 10-page bill that broadens the state’s authority to prosecute professionals regulated by the Department of Health who mislead, deceive, or fraudulently misrepresent their qualifications to the public. The Rules Committee approved the bill by a 22-1 vote. It now heads to the full Senate for consideration.
The bill would amend legislative intent language to make clear the public health, safety, and welfare could be harmed by health care providers who misrepresent their ability to practice a profession.
Broad authority
Although he voted for the bill, Sen. Jason Pizzo, an attorney, noted the broad regulatory power it would give the Florida Department of Health when prosecuting health care providers for advertising.
“If a person engages in the unlawful practice of law, it’s because they actually took up a matter, conducted a transaction, gave advice, all of that stuff.  I guess very specifically for legislative intent, the wording of your bill sort of suggests just using the title alone — without actually like seeing a patient or engaging in any conduct or behavior — standing alone just using the titles is the unlawful practice of medicine,” he said.
In addition, the bill amends the laws regulating allopathic physicians, referred to as “M.D.s,” and osteopathic physicians, referred to as “D.O.s,” to include a  list of 39 specialities practitioners are authorized to call themselves. It would be a violation for any other health care professionals to use those titles.
The bill provides exceptions for chiropractic physicians, podiatric physicians, dentists, certified registered nurse anesthetists, and anesthesiology assistants, allowing them to call themselves by certain titles already in their practice acts or included in their specialty certifications.
There is no exception for optometrists, who are often referred to as eye doctors or, according to Florida Optometric Association lobbyist David Ramba, optometric physician.
The list of 39 protected titles does not include the term physician or medical doctor but includes a variety of specialties such as anesthesiologist; cardiologist; dermatologist; endocrinologist; and gastroenterologist. It also includes the term surgeon.
The optometrists did not publicly oppose the bill in committee Tuesday but Ramba said the group isn’t on board.
“The bill says we can use whatever titles are in our practice act. Never before in state law has it required titles to be in a practice act or even in state law. Since the Senate has blocked any optometry practice act updates since 2013, we are opposed to legislation that would not allow us to use titles commonly used in the field such as ‘optometric physician,'” he said.
Eyeball wars
Scope of practice refers to the range of health care services authorized by statute and the educational requirements these providers must attain. Proposals to change scope of practice can be some of the most controversial bills legislators deal with, as they balance economic interests against patient care.
Sen. Don Gaetz iconically dubbed the long-standing fight between optometrists and ophthalmologists and the care the two professions can offer patients as the “eyeball wars” in the mid-2000s, when he served as Senate president.
Sen. Kathleen Passidomo said she’s been working on this for nearly a decade. A 2023 version of the bill was passed when Passidomo was Senate president but it was vetoed by Gov. Ron DeSantis.
Pizzo asked whether there were assurances that this year’s version of the bill wouldn’t be vetoed.
Passidomo said, “We shall see.”
Before the governor could approve the bill, it first it has to pass. As the 2025 session approaches its midway point, the House companion, HB 1341, has yet to be heard.

Committee chair Rep. Lawrence Klemin, R-Bismarck, who authored some of the amendments to the bill, said it wasn’t clear how the changes would affect the cost estimate of the bill. 
Klemin said his intention was that a new cost estimate would be generated for the bill. 
North Dakota attorney general calls for more prison time; opponents say spend more on police

The original intent of the bill, which came from North Dakota Attorney General Drew Wrigley’s office, was to ensure that criminals housed by the North Dakota Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation spend more of their sentence behind bars. 
The fiscal note tied to the original bill estimated the cost to the state at $22.7 million in the 2025-27 biennium and $21.3 million for the following two years.
North Dakota’s prison system is already overcrowded and Rep. Steve Vetter, R-Grand Forks, wondered how the original bill could be workable. 
“Where are these people going to go?” Vetter asked, adding that there is no plan to build more prison space. 
Colby Braun, director of the Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation, has contended that the original bill would cut off access to rehabilitation programs and halfway houses. 
The amendments remove a key provision requiring that offenders serve at least 50% of their sentence behind bars before being eligible for a halfway house or parole. 
The amendments include ensuring that prisoners are eligible to go into a halfway house for the last six months of their sentences and adding money for electronic monitoring bracelets and penalties for tampering with an electronic monitoring device. 
The amendments passed on a 8-5 vote. A do-not-pass recommendation made by Rep. Bill Tveit, R-Hazen, passed 9-5. 
Tveit resisted the Klemin amendments as continuing a soft-on-crime policy and said the state can afford the costs of sending prisoners to another state if North Dakota doesn’t have room.

The amended bill gives Legislative Management the option to study parole and the state corrections system. 
“The parole board is a really big player and we haven’t heard from them,” Klemin said. 
Klemin said the amended bill could be a bridge until the studies could provide legislators with more guidance. 
The bill still includes additional penalties for fleeing and assaulting officers. 
The amendments will need to be approved on the House floor. If approved the bill will likely be heard in the House Appropriations Committee next week, according to committee chair Rep. Don Vigesaa, R-Cooperstown.

(Sara Wilson/Colorado Newsline)A bill that aims to encourage condominium construction by lowering litigation risks passed the Colorado House on Monday.
House Bill 25-1272 passed on a bipartisan 59-5 vote, with some of the chamber’s most progressive Democrats voting against it.
It is the Legislature’s second attempt in as many years to pass a policy to reverse the decline in condo construction in the state, which supporters see as an accessibly priced option for first-time buyers who want to stop renting but can’t afford a detached single-family home. In February, the median single-family home in Colorado was $640,000 and the average condo was $424,200, according to RedFin.
SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
The number of condo developers in Colorado dropped by 84% between 2007 and 2022, partially due to rising liability insurance costs and frequent litigation from homeowners, according to a report from the Common Sense Institute.
“The current course that we are on right now is unacceptable. Our kids and our grandkids, for those of us who are older — they need a better future than (for) their only hope to ever be a forever tenant,” bill sponsor Rep. Shannon Bird, a Westminster Democrat, said ahead of the vote. “That is no way to achieve financial security and stability and to become a permanent member of your community. They need the chance to have home ownership.”
The bill would create an incentive program for multifamily builders to opt into, dubbed the Multifamily Construction Incentive Program. They would need to hire a qualified third-party inspector to review the project as it is being built and offer a warranty for any defect or damage the owner discovers, ranging from one year for workmanship problems and six years for major structural issues.
In exchange, the builder would be protected from construction defect claims unless the damage affects the home’s functionality or safety, including an inability to use the property, failure of a building component, injury or death.
Under the program, an owner would have six years to bring an action and the builder would need to offer to fix the defect.
The idea is to address problems without litigation, encouraging more insurers to back projects in Colorado.
“They know that those homes will be built right in the first place, but also that the first mechanism for fixing an issue — God forbid if one exists — isn’t simply litigation. In the case of the program, the expectation is that they exhaust the remedies offered to them through the warranty, knowing that if the warranty is insufficient or doesn’t meet the need at stake, a homeowner still has the opportunity to litigate that claim,” bill sponsor Rep. Andrew Boesenecker, a Fort Collins Democrat, said during a committee hearing on the bill in March.
That incentive program was amended into the bill, as well as a handful of other amendments, to appease some homeowners and the Colorado Trial Lawyers Association. As introduced, the bill would have protected builders during defect litigation as long as they had a certificate of occupancy from a local government.
Questions linger
A separate bill sponsored by Rep. Jennifer Bacon, a Denver Democrat, would have added more protections for homeowners in defect litigation, but she pulled it when some of its provisions got rolled into HB-1272. That includes a requirement for builders to give a claimant documents related to building plans, soil reports, maintenance recommendations and insurance.
Still, Bacon said there are questions lingering about the process and cost to homeowners who find construction defects under the proposed program.
Her bill would have changed the statute of limitations for defect claims to begin when a homeowner discovers a problem, not when the problem happens in the first place, but that timeline switch did not make it into the amended HB-1272.
“We’re still looking forward to striking a balance where we could confidently say that we have created a program where builders will build, but also the things that were bargained with that have to do with homeowners are not going to leave them in a place where they have to buy at their own risk, and that is incredibly important,” she said ahead of the final House vote.
The bill now heads to the Senate for consideration, where it is sponsored by Senate President James Coleman, a Denver Democrat, and Sen. Dylan Roberts, a Frisco Democrat. Six senators, including three Republicans, are already signed on in support.

Bill cosponsor Rep. Jordan Redman, R-Coeur d’Alene, has said the goal of House Bill 135 is to prioritize people who are living in the U.S. with proper authorization to access welfare benefits. Last year, Redman brought a similar bill that failed in committee.

To receive public assistance in Idaho, state agencies are largely required to verify the lawful presence of adults applying for benefits. But, Idaho law spells out exceptions for certain services, including emergency health care, immunization, communicable disease testing and treatment, prenatal and postnatal care, and food assistance for dependent children.
House Bill 135 would remove some of those exceptions, requiring state agencies to verify someone’s immigration status for access to health assistance for immunizations, communicable disease testing and treatment, prenatal and postnatal care, and food assistance for dependent children.
Under the bill, some emergency services would still be exempt from the immigration status verification requirement.

Another bill cosponsor, Sen. Phil Hart, R-Kellogg, told Idaho senators the bill doesn’t prevent people from accessing services. 
“What it does do is it would prevent the state of Idaho for paying for those. So you could still access these types of services through a nonprofit. You could pay for them yourself, or you could get somebody else to pay for them,” Hart said. “And so the impact of the bill, from a financial standpoint, is actually fairly minimal.”
The Idaho Senate passed the bill on a 26-9 vote Tuesday, with all six Senate Democrats opposing the bill, joined by three Republican senators. The House already passed the bill on a 46-22 vote.

 Sen. Guthrie was among three Senate Republicans to oppose bill

Sen. Jim Guthrie, R-McCammon, opposed the bill. He argued it could affect the public health of Idaho’s entire population — by denying public vaccine coverage for undocumented immigrants.

And he argued the bill, by denying food assistance coverage, conflicts with U.S. Supreme Court precedent that says children born in America are U.S. citizens, regardless of their parents’ citizenship status.
“In this building, we take a great deal of pride in being a pro-life state, and I share in that objective,” Guthrie told senators. “But in this case, the legislation denying prenatal care could compromise lives of the pre-born. And so I guess, unless we’re becoming selective in our application of when pro-life is important, maybe that’s a point to consider.”
 Democrats paint the bill as cruel. Arguing in favor, Sen. Zito says compassion should come earlier.

Sen. Christy Zito, R-Mountain Home, said she kept hearing the word compassion come up in debate on the bill. She argued that should come earlier.

“If I’m a mother and I have children or I’m pregnant and getting ready to have a child, why would I put my children into a position where they were in a country where I had no way to take care of them? Why would I have them in a position where I was a fugitive from the law, where I was already breaking the law by being where I am?” Zito told senators. “I think the compassion begins long before these children are in a position where they need these services. The compassion begins with making sure that we’re good with the law.”
Democrats cast the bill as cruel. Senate Minority Leader Melissa Wintrow, D-Boise, said when lawmakers debated the issue nearly two decades ago, they were careful to ensure children wouldn’t be denied services.
Sen. Ron Taylor, D-Hailey, said he asked himself two questions on the bill.
“Have we as a society lost all respect for decency? I haven’t been able to answer that one yet. I think that question remains to be answered. The second question I asked myself was, ‘What would Jesus do?’” Taylor said. “I answered that question. I’ll be voting no.”
When the bill is transmitted to Gov. Brad Little, he has five days, excluding Sundays, to decide on it. He has three options: sign it into law, allow it to become law without his signature, or veto it.
If passed into law, the bill would take effect July 1.

“We’re going to follow the law sir. We’ll see you in court,” Gov. Janet Mills told the president in a heated exchange while attending a White House event as part of the National Governors Association winter summit on Feb. 21. 
The Democrat was referring to the Maine Human Rights Act, which was amended in 2021 to include gender identity as a protected class against discrimination. Mills and Maine Attorney General Aaron Frey maintain that law supersedes the president’s edict. 
Mills warned in a statement later that day that the “rule of law in our country” is at stake and that the president will likely continue to target those who speak out against his wishes.
“Maine may be one of the first states to undergo an investigation by his administration, but we won’t be the last,” Mills said.
In the hours and weeks that followed, the federal government launched a series of investigations into Maine institutions. Below is a running list of the federal government’s actions against the state:

Title IX case against Maine schools headed to U.S. Department of Justice


By: Eesha Pendharkar - Tuesday April 1, 2025 4:14 pm












The U.S. Department of Education’s Office for Civil Rights issued a final warning Monday to the Maine Department of Education regarding its noncompliance with a federal directive for allowing trans girls to participate in girls’ sports.
If the state does not propose an agreement that’s acceptable to the office by April 11, the case will be referred to the Department of Justice, the letter said.
Meanwhile, a separate investigation by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services’ civil rights office that found Maine in violation of Title IX for “continuing to unlawfully allow” trans girls to compete in girl’s sports has been referred to the U.S. Department of Justice, according to a Monday social media post from the agency.

Federal probe targets Maine school gender policies, citing parental rights


By: Eesha Pendharkar - Friday March 28, 2025 5:12 pm












District policies that protect students’ privacy when it comes to gender identity might be violating federal law by depriving parents of information, according to the U.S. Department of Education.
In another directed investigation launched by the department based on reports from right-wing media about Maine districts complying with the Maine Human Rights Act, the department alleged that by developing plans to affirm students’ gender, districts may be in violation of the Family Educational Rights Privacy Act (FERPA).
In a letter dated March 28 to the Maine Department of Education, Frank Miller, acting director for the Student Privacy Policy Office, highlighted a 2016 memo by the Maine Human Rights Commission that explains the interpretation of the Act: “In the event that the student and their parent/legal guardian do not agree with regard to the student’s sexual orientation, gender identity, or gender expression, the educational institution should, whenever possible, abide by the wishes of the student with regard to their gender identity and expression while at school,” the memo states.
“The overall memorandum on its face appears to give school officials discretion that would infringe on the rights of a parent under FERPA,” Miller said in his letter.
He also alleged that “this same rhetoric may lead to Title IX violations if applied in a school environment,” which may warrant the investigation to be referred to the OCR.

Gov. Mills responds to Trump’s demand for apology


By: Lauren McCauley - Monday March 24, 2025 12:49 pm












Gov. Janet Mills responded to President Donald Trump’s demand that she apologize after the Democrat refused to capitulate to an executive order banning transgender girls from student athletics.
“I don’t communicate with public officials by tweet or Instagram or social media,” Mills told reporters, referring to Trump’s weekend post on Truth Social, at a Monday event celebrating the purchase of Bangor mobile home park by its residents.
“Second, all of my issues are about the rule of law pure and simple,” she continued. “It’s not about transgender sports, it is about who makes the laws and who enforces the laws. I read the constitution. Constitution says the president, the chief executive, shall take care that the law be faithfully executed. It doesn’t allow him to make laws out of whole cloth by tweet or Instagram post or press release or executive order that is fundamental law, and I stand for the rule of law and the separation of powers.”
Without naming Trump, Mills went on to say that “if the current occupant of the White House wants to protect women and girls, he should start by protecting the women and teenage girls who are suffering miscarriages and dying because they can’t get basic, life-saving health care in states across this country,” according to the Bangor Daily News.
She added that people in Maine are waiting for an economic plan. “We’ve seen tariffs and threat of tariffs that threaten our economy here in Maine and across the country.”
Last week, the U.S. Department of Education notified Maine that its Department of Education was found in violation of Title IX, a federal civil rights rule that bans sex-based discrimination in schools, giving the state 10 days to comply. Maine is expected to respond with legal action.

Trump demands Gov. Mills give ‘full-throated apology’


By: Lauren McCauley -  9:14 am












In a post to his Truth Social account early Saturday, President Donald Trump demanded a “full-throated apology” from Gov. Janet Mills, following her refusal to cave to his administration’s order to ban transgender girls from girls sports.
Maine public schools follow the Maine Human Rights Act, which was amended in 2021 to include gender identity as a protected class against discrimination.
The Republican president also incorrectly claimed that the state has issued an apology for its policy — something that was swiftly rebutted by Maine Secretary of State Shenna Bellows, who wrote that, as the “official keeper of all state records and guardian of the seal,” she “can confirm ‘State of Maine’ hasn’t apologized.”
Here’s Trump’s full post:
“While the State of Maine has apologized for their Governor’s strong, but totally incorrect, statement about men playing in women’s sports while at the White House Governor’s Conference, we have not heard from the Governor herself, and she is the one that matters in such cases. Therefore, we need a full-throated apology from the Governor herself, and a statement that she will never make such an unlawful challenge to the Federal Government again, before this case can be settled. I’m sure she will be able to do that quite easily. Thank you for your attention to this matter and, MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!!! DJT”

U.S. Department of Education determines Maine guilty of violating Title IX


By: Lauren McCauley - Thursday March 20, 2025 10:04 am












The U.S. Department of Education notified Maine late Wednesday that its Department of Education was found in violation of a federal civil rights rule that bans sex-based discrimination in schools.
The letter, addressed to Maine Education Commissioner Pender Makin from the U.S. DOE Office for Civil Rights, said the determination is based on state and district policies that permit transgender girls from participating in girls’ sports. It gives the state ten days to comply with President Donald Trump’s executive order banning transgender girls from playing girls’ sports.
Maine public schools follow the Maine Human Rights Act, which was amended in 2021 to include gender identity as a protected class against discrimination. Title IX, the federal law banning sex-based discrimination does not reference trans people directly, but the Trump administration is interpreting Maine’s policy as discrimination against cisgender girls.



This finding is the latest among several federal probes launched against the state following a clash between Gov. Janet Mills and Trump over trans inclusion in girls’ sports.

USDA deems University of Maine System to be in compliance with Title IX


By: Eesha Pendharkar - Wednesday March 19, 2025 5:32 pm












Though the University of Maine System was officially cleared by the U.S. Department of Agriculture of any violations of Title IX, Chancellor Dannel Malloy said the system had been in compliance the entire time, having previously called the probe “an unnecessary distraction.”
UMS follows National Collegiate Athletic Association rules, which were updated last month to ban trans women from women’s sports after President Donald Trump issued an executive order banning transgender girls from playing girls’ sport.
The USDA investigation was among several launched last month as part of federal scrutiny of Maine’s education policies, stemming from a clash between Gov. Janet Mills and Trump over trans inclusion in girls’ sports. USDA froze funds to the university system last week for potential Title IX and Title IV violations, which ban sex and race-based discrimination respectively. After Sen. Susan Collins reportedly intervened with the Trump administration, funding to UMS was restored.
On Wednesday, USDA concluded its compliance review in a news release saying that the university system was in compliance but also warning the rest of the state to follow suit or risk losing funding.
“UMaine’s decision to side with sanity is a win for women and girls in Maine,” the release said. “The choice for the rest of Maine is simple: protect equal opportunities for women, as required by law, or lose funding.”

Trump administration says Maine Principals’ Association, high school violating Title IX


By: Emma Davis - Monday March 17, 2025 7:46 pm












The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services Office for Civil Rights announced on Monday that it determined the Maine Principals’ Association and Greely High School in Cumberland are each in violation of Title IX for allowing transgender girls to compete in girls’ sports.
On Feb. 21, DHHS issued a notice of violation against the Maine Department of Education for violating that same federal civil rights law, which bans sex-based discrimination in schools and colleges, and on March 5 expanded the compliance review to MPA, which governs sports in Maine, and Greely High School.
According to DHHS, the entities can “voluntarily commit within 10 days to resolve the matter through a signed agreement or risk referral to the U.S. Department of Justice for appropriate action.”   The full agreement, obtained by the Bangor Daily News, can be read here.

USDA backtracks on university funding halt


By: Lauren McCauley - Thursday March 13, 2025 12:30 pm












Two days after the U.S. Department of Agriculture announced it would be halting funds to the University of Maine System while it continues its Title IX compliance review, the agency backtracked.
In a statement, Sen. Susan Collins said after consulting with the Trump administration she was alerted that the funding had been restored.
“This USDA funding is critically important not only to the University of Maine, but to our farmers and loggers, as well as to the many people who work in Maine’s agriculture, aquaculture, and forestry industries,” Collins said. “Now that funding has been restored, the work that the University does in partnership with the many people and communities who depend on these programs can continue.”

Amid probe, U.S. Department of Agriculture halts funding to Maine university system


By: Eesha Pendharkar -  12:30 pm












On March 10, just over two weeks after the U.S. Department of Agriculture announced an investigation into the University of Maine System, school leaders received a forwarded email from USDA’s Office of the Chief Financial Officer apparently ordering a temporary pause in funding for the system while the agency evaluates whether it should take any follow-up actions to “prospective Title VI or Title IX violations,” according to a news release from the university system.
“Please take any necessary actions to effectuate this direction from leadership. This pause will remain in effect until further notice,” the USDA email said.
Last fiscal year, USDA awarded $29.78 million to UMaine for research on a wide variety of agriculture innovations and environmental issues, including PFAS contamination on Maine farms, sustainable packaging materials derived from Maine forest-based materials, potato breeding and varietal development, sustainable lobster fishing and support for 4-H youth leadership and STEM skill development programs, which serve tens of thousands of Maine youth every year. 
The University of Southern Maine also has several active USDA awards. 
The state’s public universities are members of the National Collegiate Athletic Association, which banned trans women from women’s sports following Trump’s executive order, and are “operating in a manner entirely consistent with that association’s recently updated policies,” university spokesperson Samantha Warren said.
That means that the funding was halted despite the fact that the system can’t allow trans women to compete on women’s teams.

Social Security snafu puts state on edge


By: Lauren McCauley -  12:29 pm












Another incident that was initially thought to be retaliatory but later deemed an “error” had state officials on edge. 
On March 6, the Portland Press Herald reported that Maine Department of Health and Human Services had been notified by the Social Security Administration that it would be ending the “Enumeration at Birth” process, which allows parents to check a box on a form shortly after a child’s birth in order to receive a mailed Social Security card.
The state agency sent an email to birth certifiers on March 5 alerting them of the change, “effective immediately.”
By March 7, the agency had reversed course while Sens. Angus King and Susan Collins asked for a briefing “to explain why this decision was made at the start.”
A spokesperson for Collins told Maine Morning Star that the Republican did receive a call from Social Security Acting Commissioner Leland Dudek during which he explained it was done in error and let her know it was fully reversed.

Maine Sea Grant to be renegotiated


By: AnnMarie Hilton -  12:28 pm












Less than one week after the University of Maine System was notified that funding for the Maine Sea Grant program had been cut, the U.S. Department of Commerce said on March 5 it would “reopen bilateral negotiations” after appeals from members of Maine’s congressional delegation.
Vice Admiral Nancy Hann credited Republican Sen. Susan Collins’ outreach to Secretary of Commerce Howard Lutnick. Independent Sen. Angus King and Rep. Chellie Pingree also sent a letter to Lutnick demanding he immediately reverse the “reckless decision” to terminate the federal grant.

Maine Sea Grant funding cut


By: AnnMarie Hilton -  12:28 pm












The University of Maine said it was notified late Feb. 28 that the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration was immediately discontinuing funding for the $4.5 million Maine Sea Grant, according to university spokesperson Samantha Warren. 
The grant has helped finance statewide research, strengthened coastal communities and supported thousands of jobs over more than five decades. 
The Maine Sea Grant fosters coastal workforce development, hands-on marine science education for students of all grade levels, research to inform lobster and other fisheries management, as well as storm preparedness for working waterfronts. 
It has supported thousands of jobs over more than five decades, including 20 current university employees, according to Warren, who said that every federal dollar spent on the program results in $15 of economic activity in the state, amounting to a total annual impact of $23.5 million.
However, the letter from NOAA said the grant’s work is “no longer relevant to the focus of the Administration’s priorities and program objectives.”
Maine’s Sea Grant program is one of 34 across coastal and Great Lakes states throughout the country. However, it appears to have been the only one cut.

U.S. Department of Justice threatens to sue Maine


By: Maine Morning Star -  12:27 pm












In a letter to Mills dated Feb. 25, U.S. Attorney General Pam Bondi threatened to sue the state if federal investigations show that “relevant Maine entities are indeed denying girls an equal opportunity to participate in sports and athletic events by requiring them to compete against” trans girls. 
“Maine should be on notice,” Bondi warned, adding that “the Department of Justice stands ready to take all appropriate action to enforce federal law,” referring to the Trump administration’s interpretation of TItle IX.

U.S. Department of Health and Human Services determines Maine guilty of Title IX violation


By: Eesha Pendharkar -  12:26 pm












On Feb. 25, the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services issued a notice of violation against the Maine Department of Education for violating Title IX. 
Concluding just four days after it was launched, the investigation included no interviews, data requests or negotiations, according to the Maine Attorney General’s Office, which was notified by the agency via emailed letter that the state had violated Title IX, the federal law banning sex-based discrimination in schools and colleges. The letter also handed the case over to the U.S. Department of Justice —  a rare outcome for such a probe.
The lack of process followed by the agency’s Office for Civil Rights (OCR) defies decades of precedent, according to Jackie Wernz, a former OCR lawyer for the U.S. Department of Education who now represents schools nationwide in such cases. Within any federal agency, the OCR typically conducts lengthy investigations with fact-finding, interviews and legal analysis of how exactly the agency under investigation violated federal laws the office is tasked with upholding, including Title IX.
But in this case, OCR simply appears to be enforcing the Trump administration’s stance on trans athletes, according to Wernz. 
If Maine does not sue or comply, the department could withhold funds from the state as soon as 10 days after the notice, which was sent on Feb. 25. While the letter does not go into detail about the exact amount of funding that could be withheld, Maine received more than $700,000 from HHS in 2024.

U.S. Department of Agriculture Title IX review


By: Lauren McCauley -  12:26 pm












On Feb. 22, the U.S. Department of Agriculture notified Maine Gov. Janet Mills and University of Maine System Chancellor Dannel Malloy that it had also launched a Title IX review. 
As a land grant university, the University of Maine System receives funding from the agency’s Agricultural Research Service and National Institute of Food and Agriculture, which in recent years totaled over $100 million, according to USDA Acting General Counsel Ralph Linden. 
“Should the University of Maine or other entities receiving funds from USDA be found to be out of compliance, additional funding may be in jeopardy,” Linden wrote.

U.S. Department of Health and Human Services Title IX investigation


By: Lauren McCauley -  12:25 pm












On Feb. 21, the same day that the U.S. Department of Education announced its investigation into Maine, the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services’ civil rights division quickly followed suit. 
The agency said it was initiating a compliance review of the Maine Department of Education, including the University of Maine System, “based on information that Maine intends to defy” the president’s executive order on transgender athletes.
“The investigation will examine whether the State of Maine engaged in discrimination on the basis of sex under Title IX of the Education Amendments of 1972, as amended, and its HHS implementing regulation,” the announcement read.

U.S. Department of Education Title IX review


By: Lauren McCauley -  12:24 pm












Hours after Mills and Trump traded barbs, the U.S. Department of Education’s Office for Civil Rights announced it was launching a Title IX investigation into the Maine Department of Education as well as Maine School Administrative District 51, which is based in Cumberland, in response to reports that Greely High School is “continuing to allow at least one male student to compete in girls’ categories.”
The agency is arguing that Maine schools’ adherence to the protections in the Maine Human Rights Act is in violation of Title IX, which prohibits sex-based discrimination in any school or any other education program that receives federal funding.
In response, Mills issued a statement saying the effort to “withhold federal funding authorized and appropriated by Congress and paid for by Maine taxpayers in an attempt to coerce someone into compliance with his will” is “a violation of our Constitution and of our laws, which I took an oath to uphold.”",https://mainemorningstar.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/donaldtrumpfeb112025_0-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-04-01 17:07:06.214395

(Photo by Jackie Llanos/Florida Phoenix)The Florida Legislature for the first time this session on Tuesday took up what is being called the Hope Florida Act, which would create the Hope Florida Office within the Executive Office of the Governor.
Florida First Lady Casey DeSantis has led Hope Florida since its creation in 2021. It’s a state-run program that links people in need with social welfare and faith-based community groups. Since its creation, the organization says its “Hope Navigators” have referred more than 100,000 Floridians for assistance, according to the governor’s office.
It’s also seen as a vehicle that Mrs. DeSantis could campaign on should she decide to pull the trigger and run for governor next year.
Committees in both the House and Senate approved the measure on Tuesday. Their votes came shortly after  Gov. Ron DeSantis called in a large number of state troopers to stand behind him at a Capitol news conference to announce that every sheriff’s office throughout the state will have a liaison tasked connecting with those in need.
But there are questions about the program.
The House bill analysis notes that under Florida law, a direct-support organization (DSO) must submit to the agency it supports a number of items, including a copy of the organization’s code of ethics and its most recent tax returns. Existing law also requires each DSO created or authorized with annual expenditures in excess of $100,000 to provide an annual financial audit of its accounts and records.
But Hope Florida has not submitted those reports.
“House staff requested DCF provide all statutorily-required documents for the purpose of this analysis, but DCF did not provide them,” the analysis says, referring to the Department of Children and Families.
Politics of Hope
The House measure (HB 1327), sponsored by Palm Beach Republican Anne Gerwin, won unanimous approval in the Human Services Subcommittee on Tuesday afternoon, despite criticism by Orange County Democratic Rep. Anna Eskamani.
“There’s been a lot of politics about Hope Florida over the last four years,” she said. “A lot of concerns that pertains to oversight and accountability, just question marks around where money comes from, how it’s being spent, and I think those are very concerning questions.”
Members of the Legislature have questioned whether Hope Florida is simply duplicating services already being rendered by other states agencies. Gerwin said the difference is that Hope Florida can address ongoing social service problems, adding that it also “creates community.”
“I think it’s community that we used to have in our society,” she said.
During his press conference, Gov. DeSantis bristled when asked by a reporter about why Hope Florida hadn’t filed its tax returns.

“This is the nonprofit arm, it’s a charitable arm. They’re gonna take care of the paperwork, but while you’re worried about filing paperwork, we’re worried about lifting Floridians up,” DeSantis said.
“We’re not worried about trying to play phony gotcha games,” he added later.
‘Lives changed’

Dawn Murray is the director of Hope Florida. An employee with DCF for more than 30 years, she told the House committee that the program is different than anything else the state has attempted.
“Through Hope Florida, Hope Navigators are working with the families based on what they say are their needs, based on what they’re going through,” Murray said. “And through this program I have seen countless lives changed with people getting jobs, people going back to school, and people just understanding that there is hope and that there is people out there supporting them.”
The Senate version, sponsored by Tampa Bay Republican Sen. Danny Burgess (SB 1144), was approved in the Governmental Oversight and Accountability Committee on Tuesday as well.
The measure would require all state agencies to participate in Hope Florida if directed to do so by the Executive Office of the Governor. That includes the DCF, Agency for Persons with Disabilities, Department of Juvenile Justice, Statewide Guardian ad Litem Office, Department of Education, Agency for Health Care Administration, Department of Corrections, Division of Emergency Management, Department of Veterans’ Affairs, Department of Commerce, and the Department of Elderly Affairs.
Those agencies, according to the Senate bill analysis, would be charged with:

Operating the Hope Line, a toll-free hotline for Hope Florida inquiries and referrals;
Maintain a website that allows individuals to connect with Hope Florida to request services or volunteer their time or resources;
Maintain a Hope Florida case management system that can at least conduct intake for Hope Florida inquiries and referrals; and
Work with the Commerce and CareerSource Florida to maintain a portal that integrates with Commerce’s one-stop delivery system to allow for the designation of employers as “Hope Florida Employers” and provide clients access to employment and training services.

(Eric Cole/U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service)After a relatively subdued floor debate — at least as far as wolf-related bills go — the Montana Senate on Friday voted to pass three wolf-hunting bills that originated in the House. 
One bill would extend the current wolf hunting season to align with the spring black bear season, one would allow the use of thermal and infrared scopes, and the third would have required an unlimited hunting season for wolves when the statewide population is more than 550 wolves. 
The latter bill, House Bill 176, drew the most attention during multi-hour committee hearings and on the House floor, where it was amended to change a “shall” to a “may,” merely stating that the Fish and Wildlife commission would have the option to create an open season. But that change was reversed with an amendment in the Senate committee. 
But during the weekend, seven Senators changed their minds on the bill, and during Monday’s final vote on HB 176, the measure failed 23-27, after previously passing 26-24.
Two senators, Sen. Gregg Hunter, R-Glasgow, and Shelley Vance, R-Belgrade, changed from nay votes to supporting the bill, while Sens. Jason Ellsworth, R-Hamilton, John Esp, R-Big Timber, Josh Kassmier, R-Fort Benton, Gayle Lammars, R-Hardin, and Sue Vinton, R-Billings, all opposed the bill on their final vote. 
Sen. Greg Hertz, a Polson Republican, carried all three wolf bills on the Senate floor, and opened his talking points by referencing the documents that originally delisted the gray wolf back in 2009, and estimated that the entire wolf population between Idaho, Montana and Wyoming would be around 1,100 individuals. 
Montana Fish, Wildlife and Parks estimates the state’s numbers are around 1,100, Idaho’s is roughly the same, and Wyoming has around 350 wolves. 
“We’ve shown that we’ve reintroduced the wolves, and they have far exceeded where our expectations are,” Hertz said. “So I think some of these new requirements and allowances on wolf hunting should be allowed.”
But opponents said the bill was overly broad by applying to the entire state, rather than the northwest region where wolves are most heavily concentrated, and that overhunting wolves could set the state’s management plans back.
“From a livestock part, we do worry, our associations do, that if we overdo this thing, there’s a great likelihood that the wolves will get back on the Endangered Species list,” Sen. Butch Gillespie, R-Ethbridge, said, adding several livestock groups had opposed the bill in committee. “Also, it’s been my goal all along to get the grizzly bears off the Endangered Species list, and this also makes that a lot more complicated, if we reduce our wolf population too much.”
Senate Minority Leader Pat Flowers, D-Belgrade, echoed Gillespie’s comments, and said that a more targeted management approach would be a better option, and that frustrations that FWP wasn’t doing enough to reduce the population should be addressed through other avenues than legislation. 
Their comments on the floor didn’t seem to dissuade many senators, as the bill initially passed by two votes, but the final tally showed a much stauncher opposition. 
The vote put to bed the biggest legislative directive regarding wolves for the 2025 session. 
The two other bills passed on Friday sailed through their final readings with no vote changes, and will head back to the House for a final vote on Senate amendments. 
House Bill 258, extending the hunting season, was amended to remove a carve-out limiting hunting quotas near Yellowstone National Park — a change originally made by Democratic Representative Scott Rosenzweig of Bozeman to make the bill more appealing to the House. 
House Bill 259, expanding the use of night scopes, was amended to soften the directive from a “shall” to a “may.”
The House has yet to schedule either bill for a floor vote. 
One other wolf-related bill passed the Senate earlier last week, allowing for hunters who lawfully kill wolves to be reimbursed for their hunting or trapping costs.
[subhead] FWP adopts final wolf management plan [/subhead]
Even as the Legislature has continued debating how it wants the state’s wildlife agency to manage the wolf population, FWP announced last week it had adopted the final version of its wolf management plan. 
The new plan is the first comprehensive update to the state’s management plan since 2003, and the department drew upon 20 years of “management experience, evolution in conflict management, new laws, social perspective and public input,” according to an FWP press release. 
 More than 24,000 comments were submitted during the multi-year drafting process. 
“The former wolf plan served us well, but it was time to make sure our management plan contained the evolutions we’ve made in wolf research, monitoring, conflict management, and the changes to the legal framework we operate under today,” FWP Director Christy Clark said in the release.  
According to the department, the foundations for the management plan include: recognizing wolves as part of Montana’s wildlife heritage; approaching wolf management similar to other wildlife species; managing wolf populations across the state with flexibility; and addressing and resolving conflicts.
“The overwhelming success of gray wolf recovery, to date, speaks to its importance and central role in the culture of Montana,” the record of decision for the plan states. ”FWP will continue to ensure the long-term presence of gray wolves in Montana.” 
One of the biggest shifts in the 2025 plan is a change in a “key counting metric” for a minimum population benchmark. The old plan used the federal recovery baseline of having 15 breeding pairs of wolves, while the new baseline uses an estimate of the number of wolves that support 15 breeding pairs. 
FWP’s new plan established 450 wolves as the “benchmark to ensure” 15 breeding pairs, but emphasizes that “this is not FWP’s declared population target.”
Instead, the plan states the wolf population may fluctuate anywhere within the “estimated population size identified during the 2021 Legislative Session,” when a law was passed seeking to reduce the number of wolves to a “sustainable population” of not less than 450.
“Wolf management discussions continue to draw a lot of attention from people in Montana and around the world,” FWP director Clark said. “The 2025 Wolf Plan will ensure those conversations can be grounded in current science and the research FWP is doing every day.”",https://dailymontanan.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/usfws-gray-wolf-snow-large-1024x768-1.jpeg,,,2025-04-01 16:05:52.034981

(Photo by Emma Davis/ Maine Morning Star)After hearing a litany of proposals to expand the state’s tax exemption for homeowners, the Legislature’s Taxation Committee moved forward with one amended plan that would increase the exemption for all people incrementally.
In a unanimous vote among those present on Tuesday, the committee voted to advance a plan that would increase the Homestead Property Tax Exemption by $5,000 per year until it reaches a total value of $50,000 from the just value of a home over the course of five years. 
This plan, which is in LD 140, now heads to the Maine Senate and House of Representatives for approval. 
Currently, the Homestead Property Tax Exemption provides a reduction for property tax purposes of up to $25,000 from the value of a home. In order to qualify, a homeowner must be a permanent resident of Maine, the home must be their permanent residence and they have to have owned a home in the state for at least one year before applying. 
As originally proposed by Sen. Joseph Baldacci (D-Penobscot), LD 140 would have increased the tax exemption by $10,000 per year until the total exemption reached $95,000. Baldacci argued that incrementally increasing the tax exemption would be the most fiscally responsible method because it will be more feasible for the general fund to absorb costs.

The committee agreed, though opted for smaller increments and a smaller overall increase. 
The smaller increments would now cost the state roughly $14 million per year, compared to double that with the initial proposal, which Rep. Shelley Rudnicki (R-Fairfield) characterized as more reasonable. 
The amended bill also removes adjustments for inflation after the cap, which lawmakers argued felt less pertinent due to the gradual adjustments. 
“It seems like it just makes it extremely complex for everyone and I’m not sure that most taxpayers would even notice that,” said Rep. Gary Friedman (D-Bar Harbor), who proposed the tweaks.
Gov. Janet Mills’ administration testified against LD 140, and the several other proposed reforms to the homestead exemption, arguing it will shift the property tax burden to other taxpayers and result in an increase in property tax mill rates over time.
“LD 140 would provide broad property tax relief to resident homeowners, regardless of their ability to pay the tax, at a very high cost, when more focused tax relief could be provided at a much lower cost using the Property Tax Fairness Credit or other programs,” Michael Allen, associate commissioner for tax policy in the Department of Administrative and Financial Services, told the committee earlier this month. 
Last year, lawmakers expanded eligibility to the Property Tax Fairness Credit — which provides refunds for property taxes or rent paid — and created a Property Tax Deferral Program, specifically to soften the blow from the short-lived Property Tax Stabilization Program that allowed older Mainers to freeze their property taxes. 
The Legislature repealed that program after just one year in effect, following skyrocketing cost projections, concern about wealthy property owners taking advantage due to a lack of income restrictions and the administrative burden it left on municipalities.
The Taxation Committee is hearing other proposals aimed at controlling property taxes on Wednesday, including legislation to reinstate the Property Tax Stabilization Program and amend the state constitution to require greater state reimbursement for residential property tax exemptions and increase the minimum homestead exemption to $50,000.
Bipartisan efforts to expand property tax exemptions face pushback from Mills administration

While advancing Baldacci’s proposal, the committee voted Tuesday against four other proposals to expand the homestead exemption in other ways, including through one lump increase or only for particular groups. 
These rejected proposals included LD 658, sponsored by House Minority Leader Billy Bob Faulkingham (R-Winter Harbor), which would double the exemption from $25,000 to $50,000 of the just value of a home. 
Two had focused specifically on residents who are 65 years old or older. LD 7, sponsored by Sen. Rick Bennett (R-Oxford), proposes increasing the exemption to $75,000 for that group, while LD 934, sponsored by Rep. Stephen Wood (R-Greene), proposed a greater exemption amount for that group, as well as veterans. 
LD 570, sponsored by Sen. Cameron Reny (D-Lincoln), would provide an additional tax exemption of $75,000 to families and individuals who make below a certain income, bringing the total tax exemption available for those eligible up to $100,000.
The votes against these other plans were also unanimous among those present. 
The committee has yet to take action on LD 559, sponsored by Sen. Donna Bailey (D-York), which would allow municipalities to adopt a property tax stabilization program for their senior residents approved by local ordinance.

krisanapong detraphiphat/Getty Images) An East Coast investment firm is attempting to overturn a portion of an arbitrator’s award of $95 million to an Iowa family that claimed it was given bad advice on short-selling Tesla stock.
UBS Financial Services and one of its managing directors, Andrew Burish, are suing a group of nine New Hampton, Iowa, residents in U.S. District Court, all of whom are former UBS customers, and most of whom are part of the same family: Dennis, Leslie, Tyler and Noelle Hansen; Bradley and Jordan Nelson; Lindsey and Nicholas Valentini; and Hansen family friend Mark Kramer.
The New Hampton residents allegedly reaped profits of nearly $1.5 million by short-selling various stocks, including Tesla, for two years beginning in 2017. In late 2019, they allegedly resumed short-selling one particularly volatile stock, Tesla.
Typically, short-selling involves borrowing shares from a broker and immediately selling them. Then, if the price falls as expected, the investor buys back the same number of shares at the lower price, realizes a profit, and returns the shares to the broker.
The strategy is risky and only works if the stock’s price falls after the initial sale, allowing the stock to be repurchased at a lower cost.
In the case of Tesla, its stock price began an unprecedented and unexpected climb in late 2019, right when the Hansens invested.
Court records indicate that throughout 2020, the Hansens’ losses mounted, but they stuck with their strategy, believing Tesla’s price would eventually fall. Eventually, their total losses exceeded $23 million.
In 2022, the family and Kramer initiated a claim against UBS and Burish, alleging fraud, breach of fiduciary duty, violations of Financial Industry Regulatory Authority rules governing investment advice, and negligent supervision of a financial advisor.
The family claimed Burish had given them unsuitable and one-sided investment advice concerning their strategy to short-sell stock in Tesla. They also claimed Burish had violated the law by sending them unsuitable investment advice via text messages that he later deleted, and that he fraudulently led them to believe he, too, was short-selling Tesla stock even after he was no longer participating in that strategy.
In late February, an arbitrator’s panel sided with the Hansens and found UBS liable for compensatory damages of $23,059,522 and Burish liable for compensatory damages of $2,562,169.
In addition, the panel awarded $69,178,566 in punitive damages from UBS and $500,000 in punitive damages from Burish.
In their newly filed lawsuit, UBS and Burish argue that “the panel’s award of nearly $70 million in punitive damages was grossly excessive, irrational, and contrary to well-defined and dominant public policy.” They allege the maximum punitive award against UBS should have been $23,059,522 — an amount equal to the compensatory damages.
In addition, UBS and Burish argue that in cases where the fact finder does not state the conduct justifying the punitive damages was directed specifically at the claimants in the case, at least 75% of any punitive damages must go to a civil reparations trust fund that is administered by the state court administrator.  In the UBS case, the lawsuit claims, the panel awarded the Iowans the full $69 million in punitive damages, with nothing allocated to the civil reparations trust fund.
UBS: Hansens were savvy investors
In a brief filed in January with the arbitration panel, lawyers for the Hansens argued UBS had failed to ask Burish “fundamental investor protection questions, like why clients with no experience managing a short position or margin calls would be suitable candidates to short sell one of the most volatile stocks of all time.”
UBS’ attorney, Neal S. Robb, told the arbitration panel that Tesla was always considered a risky investment, and claimed the Hansen family was a financially savvy group of investors that “was wealthy enough to take the loss” stemming from its Tesla investments.
“The Hansens were not retirees, or socking their money away for the day that they were puttering in the garden,” Robb told the panel. “They were aggressive with their money. Putting it in ethanol plants and in jet aircraft leasing is not only sophisticated stuff, it’s relatively risky stuff.”
As for Tesla, Robb argued the company’s stock “was never relatively stable” and said it was “amazing” the company had progressed so far in recent years.
“In 2017, 2018, 2019, it was plagued with problems,” Robb told the panel. “It had continuous losses. It was running in the red. It had production problems, but at the same time it was a favorite of speculators, and the stock price zipped and zagged and went up or down. The panel may remember some of the things that happened with Tesla. At one point the CEO, Mr. Elon Musk, announced he was going to take the company private, and he had funding, which will become the subject of another big lawsuit, and the stock price went up. At another point, Mr. Musk tweeted the stock price was too high, and the stock price plummeted. So, Tesla was always a very, very volatile stock. It was never relatively stable.”
Attorneys for the Hansens argued before the panel that Burish had encouraged the family, via text messages that he later deleted, to short-sell Tesla stock, telling them, “I’m doing this with my daughter, family, friends. I’ll be doing it alongside you,” when in fact he had stopped shorting Tesla long before.
In 2022, the Securities and Exchange Commission issued a set of findings involving UBS, alleging that from at least January 2018 to September 2021, UBS employees sent and received off-channel communications with investors that it never preserved, in violation of federal regulations. That alleged failure “was firm-wide, and involved employees at all levels of authority,” the SEC found.
As a result of those findings, the SEC imposed a $125 million civil money penalty against the company.
Attorneys for the Hansen family and the other defendants in the newly filed lawsuit have yet to respond to UBS’ claims that the punitive damages are excessive.",https://iowacapitaldispatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/gavel-cash.jpg,,,2025-04-01 16:05:52.034981

There is no part of Utah society that has not contributed significantly to our secular sector decline since World War II, but now Utah is talking about civics education to tame our rag-tag citizens and give them a reason to be a better people?
Gov. Spencer Cox recently signed two bills intended to get civics education back on track in Utah public schools and public universities, HB381 and SB334. Both these efforts, while in part well intentioned, are thoroughly cosmetic, as one might expect. Materialistic priorities will always reign supreme in a state that believes that building programs are the measure of its success.
In the first place, the governor says a “foundational civic education in our high schools will aid our students with a better understanding of our government institutions and their critical role in American society.” While a better understanding of anything is a good thing, understanding our “government institutions” is problematic since on the national level we virtually don’t have two of our three original branches of government any longer — a functioning Congress and an independent judiciary. Both these institutions have been taken over by an anti-civic movement whose current autocratic and oligarchic interests likely will be programmed into the new Utah curriculum rendering it virtually a dead letter from the get-go.
The business and banking sector in Utah has led the charge into our current social and economic oblivion by focusing on the financial rapine of the middle and working classes, environmental and water supply exploitation and degradation, and a building program focused on luxury living for the well-off. And now Utah is talking about civics education?
The family system has fallen into ruin due to divorce, legalized pornography, sports gambling, loss of physical fecundity in marriage, and huge declines in physical and mental health. And now Utah has decided to talk about the morals and ethics and habits of the ancestors?
The churches have long been withdrawn from civic engagement and scholastic achievement, but now it’s time to mend those tattered fences? Education has fallen into such a cloud of disrepair at all levels that lifelong learning is a relic of antiquity, and the entire society believes there is nothing to be gained at school any longer because school doesn’t prepare youth for skilled employment in the technology sector. And now we think it is time to recover a modicum of the reason public education came into being in America in the first place?
Even if Congress and the courts still had some kind of job to do in the new authoritarian scheme of things, the focus of the new civics program would still skirt the most important facet of government fundamentals, which is not the physical structure of government and the buildings and places they are housed, but the law governing the operation of the branches. Those who will be programming the new curriculum do not know nor do they care about what the written law of this country says about the operation of government. In every pronouncement of theirs in defense of the new program, they studiously ignore what the written document boldly asserts. Our Founding Fathers and Mothers will not be heard in the new curriculum. They will be silenced as they have been for generations in Utah.
While one of the “primary source documents” in the high school curriculum is “The United States Constitution,” both our major political parties today are perfectly satisfied to just have people glance at them sideways without an ounce of explanation about how far we have departed from them today, or why, or how we can return to them.
Reading the foundational documents will do some good but is not nearly enough to do substantial good for students. Reading them is like reading the scripture. After you read a passage of the scripture in English, you know what the text says, but you don’t know what it means. A perfect example is a passage like, “Thou shalt not take the name of the Lord thy God in vain.” Everybody knows, even our smart theologians who write books about the Ten Commandments, that that verse means, “Don’t swear (out loud).”
However, that is not even close to the original and authentic meaning of the passage. One needs to know the historical context of the passage — its political, economic, social, and legal context. Where, oh where are Utah students going to get into the deep history and secular basis of either scripture or of democracy? Certainly not from Utah politicians, or politically motivated curriculum sponsors who care not for the reality of life, but only for the shiny presentation of it.
Students need to not only read the constitutional law, but the history of how those laws were developed and applied across the great democracies of the past. The words “Rome” and “Athens” are found in the talk surrounding the passage of the bills, but that likely will be the end of it. The bankers and builders of Utah don’t care about Rome or Athens, and they don’t even know that the Hebrew Bible/Old Testament is a sophisticated civics education text in and of itself, a constitutional history of an ancient democratic republican society. They think it is an encouragement to go to church.
Students also need to know what the basic alternative to republican government is — monarchy — what its underlying philosophy is, and how it figures into the past 5,500 years of recorded life on planet earth. Bankers and builders love monarchy, but they prefer to implement it clandestinely rather than openly, so it will never be discussed in the new curriculum.
For example, the religious-political philosophy of scripture and of democracy says that all human beings are capable of governing themselves locally by means of elected representatives. They also need to know that monarchy is a system where the blood of a dynasty of rulers is believed to be superior to the blood of common folk, enabling the rich to claim a mandate of heaven to rule forever however they wish to rule. Democracy says everyone has the same blood and the same DNA and everyone has the same capacity to do great things if given the education and the opportunity.
Consensual policymaking is of little good without an extremely well-educated citizenry, who bend their discretionary time to life-long learning and regular participation in good citizenship activities. None of that is happening in Utah or any other state of the nation today, so new initiatives such as HB381 and SB334 are destined to be either for show, or to serve as conduits for propaganda efforts by political party leaders.",https://utahnewsdispatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/GettyImages-1413318210-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-04-01 16:05:52.034981

(John Moore/Getty Images)LINCOLN — A divide between rural Nebraska lawmakers is rustling in the statehouse. 
State Sen. Teresa Ibach of Sumner, in west-central Nebraska, has proposed a bill that would exempt a significant sector of agriculture in the state — feedlots — from branding and inspection fees under the state’s livestock branding law that she has said she aims to “modernize” with Legislative Bill 646.  
“LB 646 simply provides an exemption for [feedlots], so [they] are treated uniformly across Nebraska,”  Ibach said during the bill Agriculture Committee hearing.
She has faced opposition from State Sen. Tanya Storer of Whitman, a freshman rural lawmaker from north-central Nebraska who proposed an amendment to essentially kill the bill and let lawmakers make a more informed decision later regarding one of the state’s biggest industries. Her reason: Most lawmakers don’t deal with cattle. 
“The reality is there’s only about four in this body of 49 that understand that,” Storer said. 
Nebraska is the second-largest cattle-producing state in the U.S., generating $13.2 billion from cattle and other livestock, according to the latest tally from the Nebraska Department of Agriculture. Parts of that industry are regulated by the Nebraska Brand Committee, which is tasked with investigating cattle theft and verifying ownership through branding when cattle are bought, sold or moved in or beyond the brand zone in state law, essentially covering the western two-thirds of the state. Its services are funded entirely through fees, not by taxpayers. 
The divide on the Ibach bill is that it would exempt feedlots in the state’s brand inspection area from paying branding-related fees, replacing them with a one-time payment of $500 to apply for feedlots to get exempt status. The Brand Committee called the legislation an attempt to “severely” weaken the cattle industry’s checks and balances, and several cattle industry groups have opposed it.
‘Invitation for abuse’ 
During the bill’s hearing before the Agriculture Committee, Nebraska Farmers Union president John Hansen said the Brand Committee provides security from cattle theft. He added the whole state should be under the Livestock Brand Act because the areas not in the branding area are an “invitation for abuse.”

“If I were stealing cattle, I know that I would be trying to sell them in the area of the state that does not have brand inspection,” Hansen said. “So the viability of the system will be undermined if this bill goes forward as is.” 
The Nebraska State Dairy Association testified in support of the bill and requested its own exception from the state Livestock Brand Act, calling the system a time and economic burden on the dairy industry because the branding committee hasn’t updated its ID Program. 
“Our producers are tired of waiting for the change to pay for a program that has no value to our industry,” said Steve Wolfe, who testified on behalf of the Nebraska State Dairy Association.
Bill sponsors initially included all eight of the Legislature’s Agriculture Committee members, though only six of the eight voted it out of committee for a floor debate: two original sponsors, State Sens. Mike Jacobson of North Platte and Dan McKeon of Amherst withdrew their names from the bill last week. Jacobson said it because his constituents won’t like it. 
“The only reason I signed on to begin with was to try to get to the point where we could negotiate something better than what we have today,” Jacobson said. “Every email and phone call I’ve gotten on this issue, except from the feed yards who stand directly to benefit, have been not only no but hell no. That’s a pretty strong message.”
Nebraska’s quirky branding law
Other cattle-feeding states, including Texas and Oklahoma, deal with cattle branding differently. In those states, it’s not mandatory but encouraged to deter theft, while brand inspections are mandatory in Wyoming and Colorado. 
Elliott Dennis, a University of Nebraska-Lincoln professor of livestock marketing and risk management, said Nebraska’s cattle branding approach is unique because some parts of the state don’t have to deal with the inspection fees. 
Dennis said the quirk is because areas in the eastern parts of the state have fewer cattle than most of western Nebraska. He said consumers wouldn’t feel the proposed changes to the branding law. 
Feedlot owners and beef and dairy cattle growers tried but failed in 2020 and 2021 to comprehensively update state branding laws. Dennis said feedlot owners have historically been against brand inspection due to the frequency of fees they must pay based on their cattle numbers and because getting an inspector can slow down production. 
He said who proposed the bill tells a lot about its intention. 
“This isn’t a person unfamiliar with the cattle industry,” Dennis said.
Explaining her stance
Ibach, a first-term senator, is married to the longest-serving state agriculture director Greg Ibach. She and her family own a cattle operation in Dawson County. She said the legislation is about updating the state brand law, not getting rid of it.

“To be clear, [the] bill does not do away with brand inspection inside the brand area, nor does it impact anyone’s ability to own or use a brand,” Ibach said. 
In an op-ed last month on KRVN Rural Radio’s website in Lexington, Ibach said she worked with the Nebraska Brand Committee and the Nebraska Farm Bureau after the bill’s Agriculture Committee hearing to add amendments to address the concerns from the committee, farm bureau, and other groups. 
“I believe the amendment addresses legitimate concerns raised by the testifiers and others,” Ibach wrote. 
Her amendment, AM 829, to LB 646, would cap the amount the Brand Committee can charge feedlots. 
Currently, the committee can charge for each additional increment of 250 cattle above the total of 1,000 cattle, which represents the lot’s one-time capacity. Feedlots are charged a $1,000 annual permit. If the bill becomes law, it’s estimated the committee would lose $1.6 million annually, roughly 25% of its operating budget. 
Discussions continue
Nebraska Farm Bureau Senior Director of State Legislative Affairs Bruce Rieker said the Bureau’s stance on the bill could change as negotiations between stakeholders in the cattle industry continue. 
“There are very sincere conversations going on between many of the parties now, Rieker said. “Much more so now than maybe they were earlier in the session.” 
On Tuesday, the Farm Bureau released a statement expressing disapproval of the amendment to the bill, signaling that it still opposes the changes.  
“For more than 80 years, the Nebraska Brand Committee has played a vital role in overseeing livestock brand registration, enforcement, and proof of ownership.” The statement reads, “We support the work of the Brand Committee and believe the Committee should have the fee authority necessary to adequately fund its programs.”
Nebraska Cattlemen also expressed continued opposition to the bill. Still, the group said it would “remain committed to working with Senator Ibach toward a solution that could be acceptable to the membership as we work to modernize brand laws in Nebraska.” The statement said the Cattleman Board of Directors would meet Tuesday to discuss and take a stance on the agriculture committee amendment.
Storer announced an amendment late last week to Ibach’s bill that would delay immediate action on the bill and call for a study by the Nebraska Brand Committee for potential solutions. Storer said she was “frustrated” with how the bill was initially crafted without the input of the Brand Committee and the cattle industry. She said her amendment was reasonable and would give more parts of the cattle industry a say. 
“I believe it is vitally important that we have an agency in place to provide oversight that prevents fraud and theft in that industry,” Storer told the Nebraska Examiner. “So at the end of the day, anything that’s going to weaken that agency…to prevent fraud and theft is problematic.”  
The legislation is set to be debated on the floor Wednesday.

(OIT/NJ Governor’s Office)State budget experts warned lawmakers on Tuesday of widespread uncertainty as the state moves to enact a budget for the coming fiscal year.
Though officials from the Treasury and the nonpartisan Office of Legislative Services expressed optimism about revenue collections in the current fiscal year, which have exceeded expectations, they warned a tightening economy and residents’ response to it could lead to a revenue slowdown in the fiscal year that begins July 1.
“While the broader state economy remains on stable footing, volatility in capital markets, shifting consumer behavior, and potential policy shifts could adversely impact revenue collections,” Oscar Mendez, a revenue and economic policy analyst with the Office of Legislative Services, told the Senate Budget Committee.
The office estimated $55.33 billion in revenue for the current fiscal year, about $456.5 million higher than Treasury’s own projections, with the differences mostly attributed to strong collections from the state’s pass-through business alternative income tax in the weeks after Treasury issued its estimates.
Stronger collections could ease the impact of the $1.2 billion structural deficit Gov. Phil Murphy has proposed for the upcoming fiscal year by expanding the state’s reserves, which are spent down when state expenditures outpace state revenue.
Legislators will receive another update on state revenue reflecting April tax filings in May. That update is expected to have positive news for lawmakers because markets were strong in the 2024 tax year despite the recent tumble fueled by President Trump’s tariff policies.
 Sen. Paul Sarlo (Dana DiFilippo | New Jersey Monitor)
“We’re going to need those revenues. Any April surprises, we’re going to need them for next year,” said Sen. Paul Sarlo (D-Bergen), the Senate budget chairman.
Though the previous stock market hum may be a comfort to the state budget in the coming fiscal year, staggering drops across U.S. markets — including the S&P 500’s worst quarter since Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022 — could signal a potentially steep decline in income tax collections in the near future.
“Whenever the financial markets suffer, you can assume that there will be an echo in our revenue collections,” said Thomas Koenig, the legislative budget and finance officer.
Uncertainty around federal funding — particularly on the $14 billion in federal dollars New Jersey receives for Medicaid — could also upend the state’s budget.
The future of Medicaid is particularly troubling not only because it sees an outsized share of federal spending but also because those federal funds are often paid to reimburse expenditures already made using state funds.
The fact that many federal cuts have been issued on short notice or even retroactively compounds uncertainty at the state level, said Treasurer Liz Muoio.
“It is very difficult, A, to predict what’s coming through because it’s coming piecemeal, but then it’s coming in and it’s immediate,” she said. “So when you are dealing with this on a reimbursement level, you’ve already spent that money, so the potential hit to our budget and our programs, I should say, could be drastic.”
Legislators continued to express skepticism about some of the revenue raisers Murphy has proposed for the coming fiscal year, with particular resistance to a sales tax expansion that would tax services at laser tag arenas, swimming pools, and speedways, among a host of other recreational businesses.
“I want to make it clear to everybody who’s listening to this. There’s no desire from this Legislature to tax those services,” Sarlo said. “I think they were a talking point by the governor. I think the governor realizes those will be eliminated.”
Sarlo added he hopes revenue foregone by eliminating the expansion could be made up through governmental efficiencies or spending cuts.
Public pans spending cuts, tax hikes in governor’s budget plan

Health benefits for public workers are also set to be a major cost driver in the coming fiscal year. The local part of the State Health Benefits Program is projected to see total cost increases of more than 20% for 2026, before even considering increases in the cost of health benefits.
Municipalities have increasingly moved off the state plan amid steep cost increases in recent years, feeding a cycle where a smaller and increasingly less healthy pool of subscribers leads to cost increases that spur more departures.
“There is no doubt that the rate increases our plans have experienced in the past four years outpace what other, similar state and public employers are experiencing, especially in the SHBP local government section,” Muoio said.

(Will Price | West Virginia Legislative Photography)The Senate has signed off on a bill that would target out-of-state health care providers and others who send abortion-causing medication to people in West Virginia, except in the few circumstances when it’s legal. 
The Senate passed Senate Bill 85 with a vote of 28 to 5 and 1 person absent. The bill would make it a felony to prescribe or distribute medications used for abortion to people in West Virginia unless the abortion is legal.
In West Virginia, abortion is illegal except for medical emergencies and in cases of rape and incest. Abortion via telehealth is also illegal. 
Sen. Patricia Rucker, R-Jefferson, a sponsor of Senate Bill 85, said the “important legislation is designed to protect life in West Virginia and stop the practice of abortifacients being sent and delivered to West Virginia residents without a lawful prescription.”
The penalty for violating the law would be three to 10 years in prison for a person who is not a licensed medical professional. Licensed medical professionals would face the revocation of their license, according to the bill. 
The Senate on Monday adopted an amendment from Rucker that allows a pregnant woman in West Virginia who receives an abortifacient to sue the sender and requires circuit courts to award injunctive relief and damages of $10,000 for each abortion that results. It clarifies that a person need not be indicted or convicted in order to pursue civil remedies. 
Sen. Eric Tarr, R-Putnam, was one of five no votes on the legislation. Tarr said private causes of action like what is in the bill dissuade companies from locating in the state. Senators had also adopted Tarr’s amendment that allows a public cause of action — the attorney general pursuing civil penalties of $150,000 per offense. 
“Had the private cause of action, the job killer in this bill, not been in here, man, I’d have been the biggest champion for this bill,” Tarr said. “I’d have been all over it. Because we can still come back and do this without making this mistake. Because if you want young families having babies over here in West Virginia, we need jobs, Mr. President.”
Rucker said the private cause of action in the bill is not unique to West Virginia’s legislation. It’s a deterrent for people wishing to ignore state law, she said. 
“This legislation does not further expand abortion restrictions,” Rucker said. “It does not create new law regarding abortion, it is enforcement of the existing law that West Virginia legislators have supported and voted for in the past. So just like we have lots and lots of laws in the books, we expect those laws to be followed. What this legislation does is give a pathway for enforcement.”
An attorney for the Senate Judiciary committee told lawmakers that federal courts are likely to decide the issue of criminal penalties for bills like this one. 
Louisiana last month charged a New York doctor with a felony for allegedly sending abortion pills to a pregnant minor in the state, according to reporting by the Associated Press.  New York Gov. Kathy Hochul refused to extradite the doctor to face the charges. New York has a shield law to protect abortion providers who prescribe the medication to patients in states where abortion is outlawed.
Sen. Joey Garcia, D-Marion, was another of the five no votes on the bill. Garcia said the legislation chips away at people getting health care in West Virginia.  
Health care providers testified before the Senate Judiciary Committee that the state’s existing abortion ban makes it difficult for patients to get access to drugs like misoprostal, one of two drugs used in a medication abortion, which is also used to manage hemorrhaging and treating a miscarriage. The bill would make it even more difficult to access the medications, Kelly Lemon, a nurse midwife, testified.
“This is just muddying the waters and making it harder to be a medical professional in the state of West Virginia,” Garcia said. “And it’s another step back. And yeah, there are going to be job losses, not because of trial lawyers, but because of the fact that we’re doing something again to just hurt the people of the state of West Virginia.”
The bill next goes to the House of Delegates for consideration.

(Photo by Justin Garcia / Las Cruces Bulletin)New Mexico on Tuesday joined a multi-state lawsuit against the Trump administration in Rhode Island federal court challenging billions in lost funding to state health departments — including about $60 million to New Mexico.
The U.S. The Department of Health and Human Service last week announced it was pulling $11 billion in Centers for Disease Control and Prevention COVID-19 era grants for infectious disease research, along with $1 billion in cuts for federal grants in mental health and substance use.
The New Mexico Department of Health told Source NM the federal cuts will not affect its measles programs, but confirmed on Monday the estimated $60 million in lost funding impacted 37 temporary contract staff positions.
“​​We are using state and federal funds to cover all other positions to ensure public health services for New Mexicans are not interrupted,” Nott said in a written statement. “The loss of the grant money has led to the cancellation of some contracts, but nothing that will impede our efforts to deal with the measles outbreak. We are still evaluating the potential impact of the cancellation of those contracts.”
“Our goal is to continue to provide needed public health services for New Mexicans, and we remain confident we will be able to do so despite this challenge,” Nott said.
Nott deferred comment on the lawsuit to the New Mexico Department of Justice.
In a Tuesday news release announcing the suit, the New Mexico Department of Justice said funding loss would jeopardize state vaccine programs for school enrollment, testing, disease prevention and infectious disease treatments.
“Cuts to HHS will have a devastating impact on our state, slashing critical funding for infectious disease research and response,” Attorney General Raúl Torrez said in a statement. “At a time when measles cases are on the rise, restricting these resources endangers public health and weakens our ability to prevent outbreaks and protect our communities.”
According to the lawsuit, DHHS informed states the infectious disease grants were canceled immediately and no longer necessary “now that the pandemic is over.”
The funding cuts for the mental health grants used nearly identical language, the suit noted, but said they had been terminated “to reduce the overall federal spending.”
The notices from the federal government did not include any allegations of misspending or other graft, which is required to cancel them, according to the complaint.
The cuts to grants, some of which extended into 2027, occurred simultaneously with the announcement that the agency would lay off 10,000 federal public health employees.
The attorneys general requested a judge order the federal government to reinstate the funding, arguing the sudden federal budget cuts were unlawful and would cause “irreparable harm.”
Some of the states in the lawsuit described the impact the lost grants would have, such as a 12% reduction in workforce in Minnesota and $2 billion in lost funding in California.
In a statement Tuesday, Attorney General Peter Neronha of Rhode Island, who is co-leading the lawsuit, characterized the cuts as “massive and egregiously irresponsible” and said they “should put everyone on high alert to the depths this Administration is willing to go. First and foremost, Americans expect their government to protect them from harm. By eliminating billions in critical funding for essential public health initiatives, the Administration is effectively telling the American people to fend for themselves.”

“Don’t read anything into that. They absolutely still need the money,” Reynolds said. “We just worked with those agencies and we’ll spread that allocation out over 2026 and 2027.”
The representative said most of those funds came from COVID appropriations that are going away, but the state would likely increase those agencies’ budgets next year.
The Department of Commerce’s budget will be cut by $10 million from 2025 to 2026. The committee substitute and Ivey’s recommendation cut funding for every line item under the department completely except for the Port of Mobile. That appropriation decreased from $5 million to $3 million.
“We anticipate that to be an annual line item going forward in our General Fund budget,” Reynolds said. 
Rep. A.J. McCampbell, D-Linden, brought up the $350,000 difference in the budgets for each of the legislative chambers. The Alabama Senate is set to receive $300,000 for reapportionment litigation expenses.
“I’m just trying to get an understanding why, if the budget starts here, why do they get more?” McCampbell asked.
Reynolds said that it was no different than the 2025 budget. He said the additional $300,000 is for the congressional redistricting trial. He said the funds could be used for paying attorneys or for a potential settlement.
“When they come out of that, we may have to redraw them and there’s a big cost associated with that,” Reynolds said in an interview. 
HB 186 is expected to receive a vote in the House on Thursday, House Speaker Nathaniel Ledbetter, R-Rainsville, said.

(Nathaniel Bailey for the Daily Montanan)One member of the public said the bill is “nothing short of tyrannical,” but the sponsor and a planner said it will help counties resolve zoning when numerous districts create an administrative challenge.
Monday, the Senate Local Government committee unanimously passed House Bill 614 on a voice vote, and Chairman Forrest Mandeville, R-Columbus, said he believes it’s a good bill.
The problem, as described by supporters, is zoning districts initiated by residents, or “part one” districts, can start piling up in a county.
When residents want certain standards in place, commissioners may create a “part one” district” when 60% of the property owners in an affected area, as small as 40 acres, petition for one.
Each one might have its own definition and administrative standards.
“I think there’s a lot of these ‘part one’ districts that kind of get abandoned, and there’s no real way in statute right now for a county to clean those up,” Sen. Mandeville said.
For example, bill sponsor Rep. Greg Overstreet, R-Stevensville, told the committee last week it used to be “quite the rage” for citizens to petition and create their own districts in a county.
But counties don’t have a way to terminate “zombie zoning districts,” and they become a patchwork that’s difficult to manage, he said.
“Now, we have, for example in Ravalli County, 48 zoning districts, and they don’t match up with countywide zoning,” said Overstreet, who also credited Mandeville with the idea for the legislation.
But Kendra Keating, who lives in the Spring Hill district in Gallatin County, said she moved there specifically because of its protections.
She said it scares her to think the state could give the county authority to take away the interests of the citizens who came together to form the district.
“The way this is written, where we can completely lose everything that we have, doesn’t seem appropriate,” Keating said.
The bill came from the Montana Association of Planners, and at its hearing last week, it drew support from that organization and from a county commissioner.
However, roughly a dozen residents said the bill would negatively affect private property rights, and it would upend the ability of residents to manage development in a way they believe is best for their area.
For example, one resident said the district in which he lives is prone to fire, and the district takes wildfire into consideration.
The bill would give counties a way to terminate the zoning districts under a couple of circumstances, and it has earned a lot of support from legislators, although it lost some votes as it passed through the House.
In February, it passed unanimously out of the House Local Government committee. It initially passed 94-4 on the House floor, although it lost some support on third reading, with 80 yes votes and 19 against.
The bill would allow a board of county commissioners, after providing notice to the public of a hearing, to pass a resolution to terminate a zoning district under one of two circumstances.
It could do so if the county decided to comply with provisions of the Montana Land Use Planning Act.
Adopted in 2023, the Lane Use and Planning Act outlines steps, including public participation, for managing growth and development. It requires some cities to participate, and it allows other local governments to choose to comply.
The commissioners could also take action to dissolve a district if they’ve established a larger district that encompasses the land that’s up for termination.
Mandeville said the bill doesn’t allow county commissioners to strip a district of zoning altogether.
He said the fear is that commissioners will make a change that, for instance, suddenly allows a nuclear plant in a neighborhood, or completely undermines the interests of residents.
However, Mandeville said he doesn’t believe that’s realistic, especially given the public process.
He said the bill means counties can consolidate similar districts in a way that retains the unique characteristics of each, but also makes administration more straightforward.
“It would be unlikely that this process would be used to completely subvert what the ‘part one’ district had required,” Mandeville said.
At its hearing last week, the bill received harsh criticism from residents near Bozeman and a district in Gallatin County, who argued the benefits of the districts outweigh the administrative costs.
At least a couple of them suggested the process for terminating districts should remain in the hands of the citizens, and commissioners shouldn’t have the right to undo their work.
Deanna Campbell raises sheep and chickens on her land, she grazes a few head of cattle, and she said she likes the country life.
But Campbell said HB 614 is bureaucratic overreach, and it would affect people’s property taxes and their retirements, all without a vote by the people.
“To let elected officials change zoning without a vote, maybe just under pressure from developers or state mandates, is nothing short of tyrannical and a betrayal of Montana’s tradition of local control and citizen participation,” Campbell said.
“Please don’t let our country way of life become collateral damage to high density development and government overreach.”
Wendy Dickson, who described herself as a fifth generation Montanan and property owner in Gallatin County, said some local governments used to respect property rights, but now they even want to dictate who occupies a home.
Dickson asked legislators to respect the history of rural zoning and to keep self-governing powers with the people.
She suggested counties be allowed to initiate termination, but citizens retain the ultimate authority to do so.
“Unfortunately, it seems the Montana motto of ‘live and let live’ is now lost in some parts of our state where newcomers love Montana so much, they want to regulate everything,” Dickson said.
Charles Howe, who ranches in Spring Hill, said fire is a concern in the area, fueled by winds that blow into the valley.
He said the zoning residents worked on, in place for decades, takes the fire and the landscape into consideration.
Howe said he hopes anything the legislature passes will maintain similar protections to avoid blazes such as the Palisades fire in California.
Monday, Mandeville said he considered amendments to the bill, but did not see one that would address everyone’s concerns.
He also said he believes county commissioners won’t terminate a district if citizens have bought into it.
At the hearing last week, Ross Butcher, a commissioner from Fergus County representing the Montana Association of Counties, spoke in support of the bill.
Butcher said the bill offers a straightforward process to allow commissioners to end districts when commissioners are seeking a more comprehensive approach or if a county intends to opt into the Land Use Planning Act.
Sean O’Callaghan, with the Montana Association of Planners and Gallatin County, said the bill doesn’t cut out the public because it allows for a public process.
O’Callaghan said it’s challenging, time consuming and expensive for counties to maintain all the different zoning regulations that operate independently, with different definitions and administrative standards.
“Counties are looking for solutions to this situation,” O’Callaghan said.
He said HB 614 allows counties to combine new zoning regulations over the top of existing ones, then dissolve old ones, and it is a simple solution.",https://dailymontanan.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/20250212_MTLeg-292-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-04-01 16:05:52.034981

Megan Srinivas speaks at a press conference April 1 in opposition to a bill that would prevent Iowans from suing pesticide companies for its label. (Photo by Cami Koons/Iowa Capital Dispatch) At a press conference Tuesday, Rep. Megan Srinivas, D-Des Moines, said her colleagues on both sides of the aisle have concerns with a bill that would protect pesticide companies from certain lawsuits. 
Senate File 394, advanced from the Senate Floor last week and now awaits action from the House. 
Srinivas, who serves on the House Judiciary Committee where the bill will likely be assigned, said the potential correlation between glyphosate, the chemical in the popular pesticide Roundup, and cancer is driving much of the unease with the bill. 
Srinivas said these issues have also been brought up by constituents at a series of bipartisan “cancer listening posts” held across the state. 
“It’s time that we say no to this bill,” Srinivas said. “That we say Iowans are far more important than anything else in the state. Cancer — it’s not a Republican issue, it’s not a Democrat issue, it’s an Iowan issue.”
The press conference was organized by Iowa Food & Water Watch and Iowa Citizens for Community Improvement, who have previously organized a rally in opposition to the bill. 
Ava Auen-Ryan, a community organizer with Iowa CCI said “hundreds” of Iowans have engaged in this issue this year because of the widespread impacts of cancer in the state and because “people don’t want Bayer writing the rules in our state.” 
Michaelyn Mankel with Iowa Food & Water Watch said the bill is “decisively unpopular” among Iowans.
Proponents of the bill argue it will stop expensive lawsuits from targeting pesticide companies that are following the labeling requirements outlined by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency. 
According to the lobbying group Modern Ag Alliance, which has sponsored advertisements across the state about the bill, Iowa farmers save an estimated $612 million in production costs by using glyphosate. Modern Ag Alliance alleges that without the bill, farmers would not have access to the popular pesticide.
Central to the bill is Bayer, the manufacturer and distributor of Roundup, who has already spent more than $10 billion settling lawsuits where plaintiffs allege the chemical gave them cancer. The company stands to benefit from the bill because it would stop plaintiffs from suing under “failure to warn claims,” but Bayer is not the only pesticide manufacturer that would benefit.
Jess Christiansen, the head of crop science and sustainability communications at Bayer, said the bill is “really about upholding the label and the process.” 
Bayer holds that Roundup, and glyphosate, are safe products subject to “rigorous” testing, and that testing bodies have found “no link” to cancer. 
Christiansen called the progress of the bill in Iowa “fabulous” and said Bayer applauds the Iowa Senate for its “support of the farmers and the state of Iowa.”
“We’re really hopeful that the House will keep it moving,” Christiansen said.
The bill must be eligible for debate on the House floor by Thursday, or meet an exception, to survive the legislature’s self-imposed, second “funnel” deadline.

U.S. District Judge Myron Thompson ruled Alabama's AG cannot punish residents for aiding out-of-state abortion care. (Vasha Hunt for Alabama Reflector)A federal judge Monday ruled that Alabama Attorney General Steve Marshall cannot prosecute people who assist individuals seeking to leave the state to obtain abortion care.
U.S. District Judge Myron H. Thompson Monday ruled in a 131-page opinion that the AG’s threatened enforcement of the state’s criminal laws to prosecute those who assist individuals seeking to leave the state for abortion care violates both the First Amendment and the right to travel.
“At its core, this case is simply about whether a state may prevent people within its borders from going to another state, and from assisting others in going to another state, to engage in lawful conduct there,” Thompson repeated from his ruling in May denying the AG’s motion to dismiss and added, “The court now answers no, a state cannot.”

The lawsuit was filed by Yellowhammer Fund; WAWC, formerly the West Alabama Women’s Center; Alabama Women’s Center (AWC) in Huntsville and Dr. Yashica Robinson, after Marshall in 2022 publicly threatened to criminally prosecute those who assist women seeking to travel out-of-state to get an abortion under Alabama’s near-total abortion ban. Marshall’s office later defended his power to do so in a court filing in August 2023.

“An elective abortion performed in Alabama would be a criminal offense; thus, a conspiracy formed in the State to have that same act performed outside the State is illegal,” the filing stated.
Amanda Priest, a spokesperson for the Attorney General’s office, wrote in an email that “the office is reviewing the decision to determine the state’s options.”
Alabama has had an effective ban on abortion since the U.S. Supreme Court struck down federal abortion rights protections in 2022.
Thompson ruled that the attorney general’s threats violated the plaintiffs’ clients’ right to travel. He said in the ruling that the right to travel includes the right both to move physically between states and to do what is lawful in those states, and prosecuting those who facilitate lawful out-of-state abortions would violate that right.
The court also found that the attorney general’s threatened enforcement of Alabama’s criminal laws imposes a content- and viewpoint-based restriction on speech, which violates the First Amendment.
“The attorney general has presented no other reason to deny the plaintiffs’ First Amendment claim besides his attempt to invoke the Giboney exception, which, as stated, does not extend to speech in furtherance of lawful out-of-state conduct,” Thompson wrote.
The Giboney exception would restrict speech that is directly part of or essential to committing a crime.
“Since the attorney general’s threatened enforcement cannot meet strict scrutiny, the court will enter summary judgment in favor of the plaintiffs for this freedom-of-speech claim,” Thompson concluded.
Thompson, in his conclusion, cautioned against the implications of the attorney general’s threats, writing that it is “one thing for Alabama to outlaw by statute what happens in its own backyard.  It is another thing for the state to enforce its values and laws, as chosen by the attorney general, outside its boundaries by punishing its citizens and others who help.”
“If Alabama held the power its Attorney General asserts here, it is hard to envision a limiting principle besides what the Attorney General personally sees as permissible and impermissible,” he wrote.

(Photo by Robin Opsahl/Iowa Capital Dispatch)As U.S. Secretary of Agriculture Brooke Rollins toured Iowa agricultural facilities Monday, she said the U.S. Department of Agriculture is prepared to support farmers while tariffs go into place.
President Donald Trump announced plans Sunday to impose “reciprocal tariffs” on countries that have their own tariffs set on U.S. products, set to officially roll out April 2. While earlier statements from members of the Trump administration said the tariffs focus on 10 to 15 countries with large trade imbalances, the president said Sunday the tariffs will encompass all countries that charge fees for U.S. exports.
Iowans in agriculture have expressed concerns about Trump’s original plan — later delayed — to enact 25% tariffs on Mexico and Canada. Some farmers said the move could hurt Iowa, as the state’s pork and corn industries are heavily tied to the countries. A spokesperson for the White House has confirmed that the tariffs will not contain exemptions for farmers.
Speaking with reporters at Beck’s Hybrids, a retail seed company in Colfax, Rollins tried to assuage concerns about the tariffs’ impact on agriculture. She said the Trump administration and USDA plan to aid farmers from potential economic fallout using similar strategies as in 2018, when a U.S.-China trade war during Trump’s first term led to an estimated $27 billion in U.S. agricultural export losses.
“Hopefully our farmers and our ag community won’t be hurt by — at least in the short term — by these decisions,” Rollins said. “But if they are, the president’s commitment is the same today as it was five or six years ago. And we at USDA and our partners across Congress and in Washington will work around the clock to ensure that we have the programs in place to do what we did the last time with the (Commodity Credit Corporation), and we fully expect to do the same this time, but to be determined based on what happens in the next weeks and month.”
The USDA provided farmers more than $23 billion in federal subsidies during Trump’s first term to help offset the economic impacts of tariffs. While Rollins said at an earlier stop in Waukee that “we don’t have quite the funds we had back then,” according to the Des Moines Register, she also said there was other work being done by the Trump administration to expand U.S. agriculture’s international market presence.
U.S. Rep. Mariannette Miller-Meeks, R-Iowa, who joined Rollins alongside Gov. Kim Reynolds and Iowa Agriculture Secretary Mike Naig in Colfax, said she and other Iowa officials were “very pleased” by Rollins’ commitment to go on trade missions in coming months.
“We have not seen that the past four years,” Miller-Meeks said, comparing Rollins’ approach to efforts under the Biden administration. “Six countries and six months, I think it is — because we know we need to open up more markets.”
Rollins plans to visit Vietnam, Japan, India, Peru, Brazil, and the United Kingdom in 2025.
While the agriculture secretary said tariffs are one part of Trump’s “tool kit to realign the American economy,” another component was the reduction in force happening across the federal government — including roughly 6,000 at the USDA. Rollins said she supported the effort as a way to make government more efficient and put more economic focus on “expanding the private sector, on lifting up free enterprise, on reshoring American jobs.”
“The vision isn’t that we’re putting a lot of people out of work,” Rollins said. “The vision is that we’re realigning our entire economy, where the private sector and free enterprise is driving those jobs, rather than bigger and bigger government.”

State prosecutors filed the dismissal in Providence County Superior Court Monday against Rep. Enrqiue Sanchez, a Providence Democrat, as a result of a recent guilty plea before the Rhode Island Traffic Tribunal over refusing a breathalyzer test. 
“As is common with first offense DUI cases, since the defendant admitted to the civil charge of refusing to submit to a chemical test at the Rhode Island Traffic Tribunal, the state dismissed the criminal charge,” Timothy Rondeau, spokesperson for the Rhode Island Office of Attorney General, said in an emailed statement Tuesday.
The filing from the AG’s office, which took over prosecutorial duties in late February, also stated the prosecutors were unable to meet its burden at trial on driving under the influence “due to factual and legal issues.”
Sanchez, 28, was scheduled to appear in Providence County Superior Court Friday morning for a pre-trial conference, which has since been canceled.
Neither Sanchez nor his attorney, former Rhode Island House Speaker John Harwood, immediately responded to requests for comment Tuesday.
The second-term lawmaker was arrested by Cranston Police on Feb. 3 after an officer spotted him behind the wheel of a 2017 Nissan Altima stopped at a green light on Reservoir Avenue at 3 a.m. Officers noticed a “strong odor of alcohol” coming from Sanchez, who allegedly had “bloodshot watery eyes,” according to his arrest report. 
Sanchez declined to take a field sobriety test and later refused a breathalyzer test. He “admitted that he did drink,” according to his arrest report. He was arraigned in Kent County District Court and released on $1,000 personal recognizance. 
He was charged in traffic court with civil citations of refusing a chemical test and failure to obey traffic control devices, to which he initially pleaded not guilty. Sanchez’s driver’s license was temporarily suspended by the Rhode Island Traffic Tribunal, but he was allowed to travel to and from work under a conditional hardship license. 
Sanchez changed his plea March 28, and a judge ordered him to receive alcohol treatment and complete 10 hours of community service. The lawmaker must also use an Ignition Interlock System, a breathalyzer needed to start his car, for six months.

Kim Hammer, R-Benton, asks a question about House Bill 1489 on the Senate floor Tuesday, March 11, 2025. (Tess Vrbin/Arkansas Advocate)Youth organizations that promote diversity initiatives would be prohibited from receiving state grants under an appropriation bill approved by a legislative subcommittee Tuesday.
Senate Bill 362 states that grant money will not be awarded to an organization that “compels” a person to subscribe to an idea “in violation of Title IV and Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964.” This would include any requirement that an individual is “inherently superior or inferior” depending on their race, sex, age, religion, national origin, or “other characteristic protected by federal or state law.”
Bill sponsor Sen. Kim Hammer, a Benton Republican, said during the Joint Budget Committee’s Special Language subcommittee meeting that it was important the grant funding goes to groups “that align with the educational goals of the governor and General Assembly.”
“Some of this language is borrowed … out of Senator Petty’s bill, because I think it’s good language that kinda identifies that we want youth organizations that are meeting in the afterschool setting to align with the educational goals of the state of Arkansas with any of the programs that they may initiate,” Hammer said.
The bill also lifts some language from the LEARNS Act of 2023, Hammer said, as far as “what’s allowable.”
Nonprofits affiliated with a broader, national organization that wish to receive youth organization funds must submit a memorandum of understanding signed by both that acknowledges the state-level organization intends to comply with the law’s provisions prohibiting diversity, equity and inclusion policies. 
Legislators both in Arkansas and across the country have taken aim at DEI in public education in recent years. In a Joint Performance Review Committee meeting in 2023, Hammer questioned representatives of Arkansas Boys and Girls Club affiliates about the national organization’s directives on the use of pronouns and other DEI issues.
“The Boys and Girls Club has a longstanding tradition of being built on traditional values. We’d hate to see that lost to any ‘wokeism,’” he said in that meeting.
The LEARNS Act, Gov. Sarah Huckabee Sanders’ signature education law, prohibited “indoctrination” by the Arkansas Department of Education or state public schools, while explicitly stating that the law did not ban the discussion of the ideas and history of the ideas otherwise banned or public policy issues that some might find disagreeable or offensive.
SB 362 would appropriate $4 million for youth organizations. Appropriation measures specify funding amounts but no money becomes available until approved by the Legislature through the Revenue Stabilization Act.
Only 501(c)(3) or 501(c)(4) organizations that have operated for at least five years, with “a record of financial stability,” can qualify for the grants, according to the bill. Those operating for less than five years can still qualify for the grants if they provide a financial plan and are in good standing with the Arkansas Secretary of State’s office. 
Regular afterschool programming and educational activities in specific categories would also be needed to qualify an organization for the grant funding; an organization would need to provide programming for four days a week, with a total of 12 hours, during the school year.
The organization would need to provide regular programming in two out of five categories to qualify for the grants as well: STEM (science, technology, engineering and math); academic support; goal setting and leadership activities; career exposure and workforce readiness; and community service opportunities.
The bill was accepted by the subcommittee with no audible dissents, and will go to the Joint Budget Committee next.

Solomon Peña is scheduled to receive his prison sentence at 9 a.m. on July 2 in Albuquerque, according to an order entered by U.S. District Judge Kea Riggs on March 21.
Peña ran as a Republican for a seat in the state House of Representatives in 2022 and lost in a landslide by more than 47 points.
A jury last month found Peña guilty of organizing a series of shootings that targeted the homes of four elected Democratic officials in December 2022 and January 2023 after he refused to accept defeat. No one was physically harmed in the attacks, but police found bullet holes in the buildings.
The jurors found Peña guilty of one count of conspiracy for his role in the shootings; four counts of interfering with the 2022 elections; three counts of using or carrying a firearm during and in relation to a violent crime; one count of using or carrying a machinegun during and in relation to a violent crime; and one count of being a convicted felon in possession of a firearm and ammunition.
The Democratic Party of New Mexico on Monday pointed to Peña’s case after Republican leaders in New Mexico blamed a town hall meeting organized by U.S. Rep. Teresa Leger Fernandez (D-N.M.) for a weekend fire they believe is arson on the state GOP headquarters in Albuquerque.
The case against Peña is being handled by the federal Department of Justice’s Election Threats Task Force, which was created in the wake of the 2020 election to protect election workers from violence. 
Last month, U.S. Sen. Ben Ray Luján (D-N.M.) joined other Democratic senators to urge federal Attorney General Pam Bondi to continue the task force’s work.
“Given the recent disturbing personnel and policy decisions at the Department and the lack of transparency about the future of the Task Force, we request an immediate update on the status and activities of the Task Force, as well as what resources will be provided to ensure its important work continues so that election officials of both parties can safely administer our elections,” the senators wrote.
In their letter, they asked Bondi for an update on its status and activities by Monday.
A spokesperson for Luján said Tuesday that his office has not received a response.
The jury also found Peña guilty of three counts of solicitation to commit a violent crime for trying to hire — while incarcerated — two people to kill Demetrio Trujillo and Jose Louise Trujillo, a father-son duo who are co-defendants in the case against Peña and who accepted plea agreements last year.
Jose Louise Trujillo, who helped Peña’s election campaign, had been scheduled for sentencing on April 14, but his attorney asked Judge Riggs to delay his sentencing by a month. Online court records indicate Riggs entered an order responding to his request but the order itself was not posted online as of publication time.
Demetrio Trujillo is scheduled to be sentenced on May 21.
One of Peña’s victims, Debbie O’Malley, went on to become a state senator, and talked about her experience in the Roundhouse while she helped carry gun safety legislation.

(Photo provided by the Oklahoma Department of Corrections)OKLAHOMA CITY — An inmate who was transferred to Oklahoma last month to face the death penalty now has an execution date.
George John Hanson, also known as John Fitzgerald Hanson, is scheduled to die on June 12 for the 1999 murder of 77-year-old Mary Bowles. The Oklahoma Court of Criminal Appeals on Tuesday set the execution date.
The state’s Pardon and Parole Board has a tentative date of May 7 for Hanson’s clemency hearing, executive director Tom Bates said.
Hanson, now 60, was convicted of kidnapping Bowles, a retired banker and well-known volunteer, from the parking lot of a Tulsa mall and shooting her to death at a dirt pit near Owasso. His accomplice, Victor Cornell Miller, is serving a life sentence without the possibility of parole for killing a witness of the murder, bystander Jerald Max Thurman.
Attorneys for Hanson said the jury that sentenced him to death was unaware of evidence that Miller bragged about killing Bowles. Hanson’s lawyers didn’t investigate or present evidence of his autism and related impairments, his current attorneys said.
The Tulsa County district judge who presided over Hanson’s trial, Caroline Wall, wrote that she would have recommended a sentence of life without parole, according to a 2006 report. 
Miller took advantage of Hanson and roped him into a series of crimes, Hanson’s attorneys said.
“John Hanson is a peaceful prisoner whom correctional staff believe adds value to the prison community,” his attorney Emma Rolls said. “He poses no danger to anyone in prison. The jury that convicted him never knew that his co-defendant had bragged about being the real killer, and the trial judge herself felt this omission warranted a life sentence. These are exactly the kind of circumstances for which clemency is needed, to prevent an unnecessary and pointless execution.”

Attorney General Gentner Drummond requested that Hanson transfer to Oklahoma from a federal prison in Louisiana where he was serving a life sentence for an unrelated bank robbery.  
Hanson initially was scheduled for execution in 2022, but the Federal Bureau of Prisons, then under President Joe Biden’s administration, refused to move him to Oklahoma. 
U.S. Attorney General Pam Bondi approved the transfer request on Feb. 13 after President Donald Trump ordered the federal government to comply with capital punishment sentences.
Hanson is now imprisoned at the Oklahoma State Penitentiary in McAlester.
“The monster who abducted and murdered a 77-year-old woman more than 25 years ago is finally set to pay for his crime,” Drummond said. “The family of Mary Bowles has waited many agonizing years for George John Hanson to be brought to justice, and on June 12, that day finally will come.”

Democrats unanimously backed the resolution, passing it along party lines with their two-vote majority. The resolution is a statement by the legislative body and has no impact on Minnesota laws or agencies. 
It did, however, put Republicans in an uncomfortable position, forcing them to take a position on the pardons, which were largely opposed by the American public — especially pardons for rioters who were convicted of assaulting police officers.
Twenty-two Republicans voted against the resolution; 10 GOP senators abstained.
“This is simply partisan political theater,” said Sen. Jordan Rasmusson, R-Fergus Falls, who voted no.
More than 1,500 people were convicted of crimes related to the 2021 insurrection at the U.S. Capitol after a rally in which Trump falsely claimed he won the election and encouraged attendees to walk towards the Capitol and “fight like hell.”
“And if you don’t fight like hell, you’re not going to have a country anymore,” he said that day. 
Rioters then stormed the Capitol; interrupted the election certification process, forcing lawmakers into hiding; and injured 140 police officers. 
Minnesota Republicans Tuesday repeatedly turned the conversation to former President Joe Biden’s immigration policies and pardons, and Gov. Walz’s recent quips celebrating Tesla stock dropping in value.
Sen. Bill Weber, R-Luverne, introduced an amendment that would have condemned Walz’s comments about Tesla stock, rather than the Jan. 6 pardons.
“Any time that any elected official stands up and tries to affect the value of the stock, be it positive or negative, that is an inappropriate action,” said Sen. Glenn Gruenhagen, R-Glencoe. 
Republicans spent years decrying “woke” corporations, including Disney, Target and Anheuser-Busch.
And in response to Tesla’s stock falling, Trump used the White House to show off Teslas, encouraged Americans to buy the cars and said he would buy one himself.
Sen. Eric Pratt, R-Prior Lake, said he condemned the violence committed on Jan. 6, but that he would abstain from voting on the resolution. 
“It’s interesting that we’re dealing with it on April Fools Day,” Gruenhagen said. “Maybe there’s a connection.”

(Molly Adams/Lawrence Times)TOPEKA — Former Douglas County District Attorney Suzanne Valdez told members of the Kansas Supreme Court on Tuesday that she “never in my craziest of nightmares” thought she would be standing before them at a disciplinary hearing.
Valdez, who lost a reelection bid last year, faces potential discipline for a news release and Facebook post in March 2021 that included a personal attack on a judge. During a 10-minute speech before the court on Tuesday, she described the “chaotic time” in which she took office.
She told justices she was “emotionally fragile” in 2021 because her brother had died from a drug overdose, her predecessor refused to help with the transition of power, and the district court — without her input — had decided to resume jury trials on her first day in office, even though COVID-19 vaccines were not yet widely available.
Douglas County District Judge James McCabria issued a news release that said the court had “consulted with all the stakeholders,” the Lawrence Times reported. Valdez wanted the public to know she wasn’t involved.
In a Facebook post, she wrote: “Women of the world- be prepared! If you are hardworking, outspoken, honest, AND in a position of authority, the INSECURE MAN will try to tear you down. Not me, says I!!”
On Tuesday, Valdez she should have taken the high road but was “petty” instead.
“I’m sorry. I apologize. I made a grave mistake when I allowed myself in my frustration and the turmoil and COVID and all the anxiety and all of that to get the better of me,” Valdez said. “That’s not who I am. I’m a very passionate person. I’m a very honest person. I am all those things, and I am sorry.”
She wiped away tears as she sat down, took a deep breath and stared at the notebook in front of her.

Five members of the court heard arguments from Kimberly Bonifas, a Wichita lawyer who prosecuted Valdez on behalf of the Office of the Disciplinary Administrator, and Stephen Angermayer, a Pittsburg lawyer who defended Valdez. Justice Evelyn Wilson, who plans to retire July 4, is not hearing any more cases, and Justice K.J. Wall recused himself.
Bonifas had argued that Valdez should lose her license, but a three-member disciplinary panel recommended she face public censure instead, leaving a blemish on her record that could limit a lawyer’s professional career. Angermayer asked for an informal admonishment instead.
During Tuesday’s hearing, Justices Caleb Stegall and Dan Biles questioned the legitimacy of an ethics rule that prohibits “undignified or discourteous conduct” by an attorney that is “degrading” to a court.
Bonifas said personal comments about a judge would be inappropriate even in a closed-door meeting, let alone a public news release and social media post.
Stegall said the rule in question has to do with “big ideas,” like maintaining the integrity of the judicial system. But even if Valdez’ comments were “stupid and foolish,” he said, “does it really serve the legitimacy and integrity of the judicial branch to punish speech that we find offensive?”
“It just strikes me that we potentially do more harm than good when we punish speech,” Stegall said.
Bonifas said Valdez could have criticized the judge without resorting to “petty criticism” and name-calling.
Stegall’s response: “Is it wise to punish petty criticisms? Doesn’t that make us look petty?”

Biles asked how the violation in question could survive a First Amendment test, especially since it was about an individual judge and his press release and not about an adjudication. And he said Valdez’ comments were “off-campus,” meaning on Facebook, rather than in a court proceeding.
“What’s the government interest in preventing a lawyer from criticizing a judge?” Biles said.
Bonifas argued that Valdez harmed the public. She said the judge was speaking on behalf of the court and was trying to educate the public about the court’s plan to address health and safety concerns. That communication was met with name-calling that left members of the public “appalled,” Bonifas said.
Justice Eric Rosen said “we seem to be forgetting” that courts in 2021 were struggling to figure out how to protect constitutional rights while dealing with a public health crisis.
“When we were in the throngs of that stuff, we were desperate to try to get just the process going to meet all of the needs of both prosecutors’ offices, defense counsel and criminal cases and just all cases,” Rosen said.",https://kansasreflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/20250401-Valdez-oral-arguments-13-1024x640.jpg,,,2025-04-01 15:06:33.836981

The Oklahoma Opioid Abatement Board is preparing to give out a new round of grants to statewide applicants. Soon, local governments will be able to take a bid at $29 million designated to address the opioid crisis.
Applications for a chunk of the money will open May 12 and run through June 11. All Oklahoma counties, municipalities, public school districts, technology school districts and public trusts are eligible to apply.
Housed in the Attorney General’s Office, the Opioid Abatement Board (OAB) is one of the state’s mechanisms for addressing the opioid crisis that has plagued Oklahoma over the last decade.
Funds won from settlements with opioid manufacturers and distributors are appropriated to the board by the state Legislature. The board is then responsible for choosing how to distribute the money from the Opioid Abatement Revolving Fund.
Board members Dr. Atul Walia, Dr. Kelly Dunn and Carol Bush have volunteered to be part of the subcommittee that will review the next round of applications.
Where did the last round of grants go?
So far, the OAB has awarded over $12 million in grants throughout the state.
The money the board has already distributed is divided among 85 different grantees. Grants ranged from almost $20,000 to $700,000, with the largest sum awarded to a joint application from the City of Tulsa and Tulsa Public Schools. The second largest grant of $600,000 went to Tulsa County.

Of the 85 political subdivisions awarded money, 15 were granted funds only after making edits to their initial proposals. The board reported it received more than 100 grant applications in total, despite more than 250 groups initially expressing interest.
Each grant proposal looked different, but had to address one of the board’s approved uses, including treatment and recovery programs, opioid abuse education, naloxone training and distribution and mental health care.
Terry Simonson, special counsel to the Attorney General, said around 1,400 political subdivisions are eligible to apply for grants. Still, many don’t have dedicated grant writers or available staff to put together a proposal for the money.
He said these barriers have deterred some potential applicants.
“Probably the most common reason,” Simonson said, “was, ‘I don’t know what we need, so how do I know what to ask for?’”
Simonson said the board is updating its website for the next grant cycle, adding answers to commonly received questions and resources about how to complete a needs assessment.
Still, he said he’s proud of the impact initial community investments have already made.
“Six months ago, there wasn’t anyone sitting here who said, ‘I’ve been hired to work in the opioid space for my county,’ and now you’ve got several of them,” Simonson said during the most recent OAB meeting. “That’s where we got to go. I need some generals on the ground.”
What’s different about this round of grants?

	
During the first round of grants, the legislature appropriated $23 million to the OAB, of which the board awarded $12 million.
Dr. Kelly Dunn, who helped decide which projects to spend the money on, said she hopes the board will be able to give out more this go-around.
“We’d love to give all $29 million out if there’s appropriate projects applied for,” Dunn said.
She said the board will now accept proposals that extend over three years. Previously, only one-year projects (that could be spent over two years) qualified for grant money.
Depending on its population size, each applicant will also be able to apply for three times as much money as before.
Bill to expand uses, eligible applicants

	
A bill expanding the authority of the board and its decision-making capacity cleared its first legislative hurdle earlier this month.
Requested by the Attorney General’s Office, Senate Bill 574 expands uses for grant money and adds colleges and universities to the list of eligible applicants. The bill passed with a 39-7 vote in the Senate and can now be considered by the House of Representatives.
If adopted, the board can establish new criteria to determine how grants are disbursed – an expansion from previous considerations, which included metrics like the number of opioid-related deaths in a given area.
The bill would also allow the board more flexibility in spending. It opens up funds to approved uses authorized by opioid-related settlement agreements involving the state and earmarks 10% of funds for statewide projects.
“The genesis of this bill is lessons learned from when we deployed the first time,” AG Gentner Drummond said. “We had $20 million and we didn’t get it all deployed; how can we make it more effective, more efficient for us and give staff the opportunity to touch more lives?”

GOP leaders opted to cancel votes for the rest of the week afterward.“People have emotional reasons for doing what they’re doing,” Speaker Mike Johnson told reporters after the failed vote. “But we’re going to keep governing. This is a small, razor-thin majority and we have to build consensus on everything. I wish they had not taken this course, but we’re not shaken by this.”The discharge petition from Florida GOP Rep. Anna Paulina Luna and Colorado Democratic Rep. Brittany Pettersen received signatures from 218 lawmakers, indicating it has the support needed to change the House’s rules when a vote is held.Florida Rep. Byron Donalds, Georgia Rep. Richard McCormick, New Jersey Rep. Jeff Van Drew, New York Rep. Michael Lawler, Ohio Reps. Michael Rulli and David Joyce, Pennsylvania Rep. Daniel Meuser, Tennessee Reps. Tim Burchett and Andy Ogles and Texas Reps. Dan Crenshaw and Wesley Hunt were the Republicans who signed the discharge petition.A newborn on the House floorPettersen, holding her newborn in her arms, urged House lawmakers to ensure that women who cannot travel to the Capitol due to their pregnancies and new parents can still represent their constituents.“When I was pregnant, I couldn’t fly towards the end of my due date because it was unsafe for Sam, and you’re unable to board a plane,” Pettersen said during floor debate. “I was unable to actually have my vote represented here and my constituents represented.”“After giving birth I was faced with an impossible decision: Sam was four weeks old and for all of the parents here we know that when we have newborns it's when they’re the most vulnerable in their life, it’s when they need 24-7 care, when taking them even to a grocery store is scary because you're worried about exposure to germs and them getting sick — let alone taking them to an airport, on a plane and coming across the country to make sure you’re able to vote and represent your constituents.”Pettersen said she was “terrified that no matter what choice” she made about whether to vote in-person, she would have “deep regrets.”“So Sam and I made the trip out and this is our third time coming to the floor for a vote,” she said. Pettersen said it was “unfathomable that in 2025” Congress had not modernized to have basic parental leave and said the institution has “a long ways to go to make this place accessible for young families like mine.”Luna said she had spent years trying to convince Republican leaders to allow new parents to vote by proxy. But after exhausting all of her options, worked with her colleagues to gather signatures for a discharge petition.“Now, leadership, because of the fact they don’t like that I was successful at this, is trying to change the rules,” Luna said, calling GOP leaders’ choice “fundamentally dangerous.”‘A new laptop class in America’Massachusetts Democratic Rep. Jim McGovern, ranking member on the Rules Committee, said Republican leadership was ""trying to overturn the Democratic process of majority rule.""""When 218 of us sign a petition, the House rules say it can be brought up for a vote,"" McGovern said. ""But a backdoor provision slipped into this rule is being used to shut down that process — an unprecedented step. Literally, it has never been done before in the history of the House.""House Rules Chairwoman Virginia Foxx, R-N.C., opposed moving forward with the discharge petition and a floor vote on proxy voting.“I know there’s a new laptop class in America that seems to operate increasingly in a virtual space, but that’s simply not a fact of life for most American workers and I believe Congress should live by that standard,” Foxx said.Members of Congress, including dozens of Republicans, voted by proxy during the coronavirus pandemic.Speaker Johnson has also allowed discharge petitions to move forward before. Just last year Congress cleared a bill making changes to Social Security benefits for some Americans after members from both political parties signed a discharge petition.Tuesday’s measure, titled Proxy Voting for New Parents Resolution, would allow House members who just gave birth, or had a spouse give birth, to designate another lawmaker to vote on their behalf for 12 weeks.The resolution would also allow House lawmakers to vote by proxy before giving birth if their health care providers advised the “pregnancy presents a serious medical condition or that she is unable to travel safely.” The legislation would not affect the Senate. Generally, each chamber of Congress sets its own rules and does not try to tell the other chamber how to operate.Luna quits Freedom CaucusLuna left the far-right Freedom Caucus on Monday over the group's efforts to block her discharge petition from moving forward, writing in a two-page letter that “the mutual respect that has guided our caucus” for years was “shattered last week.”“This was a modest, family-centered proposal,” Luna wrote. “Yet, a small group among us threatened the Speaker, vowing to halt floor proceedings indefinitely — regardless of the legislation at stake, including President Trump's agenda — unless he altered the rules to block my discharge petition.”Luna rebuked several of the Freedom Caucus members, without naming names. She said their choice to try to block the discharge petition from moving forward by embedding language in a rule that set up debate on a separate bill was duplicitous.“This tactic was not just a betrayal of trust; it was a descent into the very behavior we have long condemned — a practice that we, as a group, have repeatedly criticized leadership for allowing,” Luna wrote. “To those involved, I ask: Why? Why abandon the principles we've championed and resort to such conduct?“The irony in all of this is that I have never voted by proxy, yet one of our own on the Rules Committee that is so adamantly opposed has done so over 30 times.”",,,,2025-04-01 15:06:33.836981

(Photo by New Jersey Monitor)A private prison company aiming to open a massive immigration detention center in Newark is renovating the building without securing proper permits, has barred city inspectors from entering the facility, and is flouting city code to finish construction, Newark officials allege in legal documents filed Tuesday. 
Geo Group’s “wanton and unlawful occupation” of Delaney Hall — the building where the company plans to open the east coast’s largest migrant jail by this summer — exposes Newark to potential liabilities, the city says in a nine-page complaint filed in state Superior Court in Essex County. 
“The city will suffer greater harm if not permitted to inspect the property than defendants will suffer if delayed in their use of the building pending inspection and compliance,” city attorney Morrison Kent Fairbairn wrote in the complaint. 
The filing comes one day after Newark engineering officials issued a stop-work order to halt all construction on the site. 
“As I have stated in the past, without compliance with requirements, Delaney Hall cannot lawfully open,” Newark Mayor Ras Baraka, who opposes plans to open the new immigrant jail, said in a statement. “We will not tolerate federal attempts to ignore or evade our laws and statutes, which apply to everyone.” 
In February, U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement announced it signed a 15-year contract with Geo Group to house immigrant detainees at Delaney Hall, a 1,000-bed facility located next to the Essex County jail. ICE officials said the detention center would help manage the influx of migrants arrested and detained under President Donald Trump, who recaptured the White House in January after pledging a mass deportation effort. 
Immigrant advocates have protested Geo Group’s plans, with Baraka — who is one of six Democrats running for governor — joining activists in their calls to keep the jail from opening. He told reporters at a protest in March that he’d padlock the building to block its opening if Geo Group didn’t obtain the proper approvals. 
New Jersey has a state law barring private and public companies from contracting with ICE to house immigrant detainees, but a federal judge struck down part of the law pertaining to private companies in 2023. The state has appealed the ruling, and the appeal is scheduled to be heard in a few weeks.
On Monday, Newark officials told Delaney Hall’s director they’d visit the facility for inspections of the fire alarms and elevator functionality, but Geo Group staff stopped them from entering, according to the complaint. 
While inspectors weren’t allowed inside the facility, they saw electrical and plumbing work occurring outside despite no permit to do such work, which “creates a serious health risk,” the complaint says.
A Geo Group employee told city officials that the building is currently being used as a training facility, according to the complaint. But without certified and properly working elevators that pass inspection, the building is a “life safety hazard for every occupant,” according to the complaint. 
City officials also note that HVAC, electrical, plumbing, and other systems have not been used in the building for years, and the city has had no way to check whether these are functional, the complaint says. Delaney Hall held immigrant detainees between 2011 and 2017.
It’s also unclear whether any upgrades are up to city and state code, considering no permit has been taken out, the city says. 
“The lack of an inspection presents an immediate and significant risk to life safety, including fire hazards due to improper electrical wiring, risk of electrocution due to unpermitted electrical work, insufficient plumbing which may yield to low water pressure and environmental issues due to improper disposal of wastewater and solid waste, inability to conduct an elevator recall in case of fire placing occupants at risk of injury during evacuation procedures, just to name a few hazards to the safety of the occupants,” city engineering director Dolores Martinez Wooden said in an affidavit. 
The city is asking a judge to order Geo Group officials to allow inspectors into the building, halt all construction, and comply with all local fire, health, and safety regulations. 
ICE and Geo Group did not immediately respond to requests for comment.
Delaney Hall would be the state’s second private detention center for immigrants. Elizabeth Detention Center, which holds about 300 detainees, has been used as a processing center before people are deported or sent to other detention centers.
Fears are mounting about the potential of a third migrant lockup in New Jersey. In Union County, the board of commissioners has moved to sell its unused jail, fueling concerns from immigrant activists that it could become another detention center.

House Bill 193, “Firearm Law Revisions,” authorizes those with a valid concealed handgun permit (along with those who are exempt from the requirement to have a permit) to possess or carry a handgun on educational property owned, used, or operated by a private school, according to the bill text.
Its primary sponsors are Reps. Jeffrey McNeely (R-Iredell), Reece Pyrtle (R-Rockingham), Charles Miller (R-Brunswick, New Hanover), and Todd Carver (R-Iredell).
  Rep. Jeff McNeely (Photo: ncleg.gov)
McNeely said that while the bill is currently broad, its objective is to allow security guards or others with training to provide reassurance in the event of a shooting at a private school.
“This would allow some of these smaller private schools… to have somebody that they designate to be able to add some layer of protection to them until the law enforcement can get there,” McNeely said.
As worded, the bill would allow anyone lawfully entitled to carry a concealed handgun — including a school official, teacher, or even a student — to carry it on the premises of a private school below the college level, with written permission from the school.
The legislation’s impact could expand if either of two pending bills authorizing so-called “constitutional carry” — Senate Bill 50 or House Bill 5 — were to be enacted into law.
These bills would allow individuals 18 or older to carry concealed handguns without obtaining a permit, a deviation from current law. Senate Bill 50 has passed through the upper chamber and is now in the House, while House Bill 5 awaits another committee hearing in its original chamber.
Rep. Laura Budd (D-Mecklenburg) asked if the legislation is too broad, given that there are no requirements pertaining to training or background checks.
“What we’re hoping is this will allow for security guards who are not able, people who do have training, but they do not fall under law enforcement, to be able to be there on hand and hopefully offer some level of protection,” McNeely said.
The sponsor emphasized that the bill does not circumvent existing concealed carry laws in the state – security guards would need to have permits in order to carry concealed handguns.
Rep. Deb Butler (D-New Hanover) pointed out that polling shows the bulk of North Carolina teachers do not favor guns in schools.
“This bill endangers students, it endangers teachers, and people don’t want it,” she said. “You’re telling the teachers of North Carolina that we don’t really care what you say.”
McNeely responded that the bill is not a requirement. While it allows private schools to employ these security guards, it does not make it mandatory.
The bill also includes a provision that would insulate certain law enforcement-operated shooting ranges from civil liability or criminal prosecution relating to noise or noise pollution.
House Bill 193 now heads to the House Education K-12 Committee for further debate.

The House Judiciary 2 Committee also voted to approve House Bill 301, “Social Media Protections for Minors Under 16,” moving the measure to the House Commerce and Economic Development Committee.

Attorneys for a Baton Rouge woman facing eviction filed a lawsuit March 24 in U.S. District Court for the Middle District of Louisiana. They take issue with how local justices of the peace can supplement their budgets and salaries through the fees they charge for adjudicating evictions.
State law allows justices of the peace to charge defendants $120 for each eviction case they handle plus another $20 for each additional defendant. To execute the eviction, their courts receive $60 per case and another $20 per defendant.

The organizations suing Steven Sanders, an East Baton Rouge Parish justice of the peace, say he handles 300 to 400 evictions a week. They want their case designated as a class action to bring more tenants on board as plaintiffs. 
As of now, the Southern Poverty Law Center, the National Housing Law Project and New Orleans civil rights attorney William Quigley represent just one tenant: Latoria George, who currently faces eviction in Sanders’ court. 
Anjana Joshi, a Southern Poverty Law Center attorney representing George, sat in on other eviction cases Sanders handled to track his pace.
“He will often schedule [multiple] evictions filed by the same landlord for the same morning … and those will all be decided kind of in rapid succession,” Joshi said.
“What we observed was that often tenants don’t show up, so there’s a default judgment that Justice of the Peace Sanders signs,” she said. “Sometimes tenants do show up, and he may try to work out a payment plan with them. But when he does that, he still issues a judgment of eviction against them.” 
Sanders moved through cases without tenants in seconds, according to Joshi. When tenants did appear, “It could take, like, up to a couple minutes.” 
The seemingly expedited eviction process is at the heart of the lawsuit against Sanders, whose caseload generated nearly $2.7 million in court fee revenue between 2019-23 based on figures from the Louisiana Legislative Auditor.
The state attorney general’s office, which represents local justices of the peace in legal matters, declined to comment on the lawsuit. Reached by phone Monday, Sanders said he could not discuss the pending litigation under advisement from the attorney general. 
‘A very, very lucrative business’
Sanders’ total court expenses averaged less than $20,000 annually over that same period, leaving ample revenue for him to tap into to augment his base salary of around $5,000 a year that the state allocates. 
Sanders’ take-home pay from 2019-23 averaged $232,419 a year, making him the highest paid justice of the peace in East Baton Rouge Parish according to reports filed with the Louisiana Legislative Auditor. That places him well ahead of the average salaries for state district court judges ($173,788) and Louisiana Supreme Court justices ($193,227).
“It’s a very, very lucrative business,” said Hannah Adams, a plaintiff’s attorney with the National Housing Law Project. 
Sanders is not alone among Louisiana justices of the peace who churn out a high rate of evictions and see a corresponding increase in personal compensation. Three justices of the peace in Jefferson Parish were featured in a WDSU-TV report on their court revenue-boosted salaries. 

Kevin Centanni presided over 60 eviction cases in his Kenner district during one week in February. In 2023, he reported a total salary of $147,637, with $115,000 coming from fees. 
Vernon Wilty III, who presides over a West Jefferson justice of the peace court, added $202,543 in fees to his base pay of $24,134. 
Charles “Chuck” Cusimano II of Metairie reported his salary was $21,600 with an additional $327,588 in fee income .     

“If Judge Sanders or any of the other justices of the peace are dependent on the money that landlords pay them to file evictions, they have a financial incentive to get as many landlords as possible to file evictions,” Adams said. “And even more insidious, they have potentially a financial incentive to grant as many evictions as possible, because they get an extra $40 or so every time they grant an eviction.”
Landlords’ preferred venue  
There are nearly 400 elected justices of the peace in Louisiana. In addition to evictions, state law allows them to preside over auto repossessions, small claims cases and marriages. They don’t have to be lawyers, and their “courtrooms” can be based out of home offices and other nondescript places.
Instead of going before a justice of the peace, landlords can file eviction cases with city or state district courts. But the plaintiff’s attorneys say justices of the peace are their preferred venue because they don’t have to follow evidence rules. 
For example, a landlord could testify that a tenant is being evicted for excessive noise based on a neighbor’s complaints. A justice of the peace could accept the landlord’s word as fact, while the neighbor would be required to testify in district court.
Also, a tenant’s ability to appeal a ruling from a justice of the peace is limited. State district court decisions can be challenged all the way up to the Louisiana Supreme Court. But if an evicted tenant wants to appeal a justice of the peace ruling, they essentially have to start a new trial in district court because there are no records to review from the justice of peace. Plus, the district court’s ruling is final.
“The financial conflicts of interest that [are inherent] in justice of the peace courts and the unequal access to appellate rights granted to tenants in justice of the peace courts create a two-tiered system of justice in Louisiana,” the plaintiff’s attorneys argue in the lawsuit.
Due process and funding concerns
George’s legal team is leaning on two precedents in which the U.S. 5th Circuit ruled courts violated the constitutional right to due process when they funded their operations with fees and fines assessed against criminal defendants. 
In one case, appellate judges ruled against Orleans Parish Magistrate Judge Harry Cantrell, who was running his court on non-reimburseable fees collected from bail bond businesses. The plaintiff’s attorney noted Cantrell frequently steered defendants to bondsmen, rather than accept cash. The judge also routinely set high bonds and advised accused parties not to seek lower ones, according to court records.
The other case found Orleans Parish Criminal District Court collected fines and fees from defendants for its Judicial Expense Fund. The 5th Circuit ruled the system violated defendants’ due process rights and presented a conflict of interest under the 14th Amendment.
It would take a change in Louisiana law to keep justices of the peace from dipping into their revenue accounts to pump up their salaries.
State Rep. Jerome “Zee” Zeringue, R-Houma, has been the most outspoken among lawmakers on the topic of judicial compensation. He has also been a critic of courts that rely on revenue that’s self-generated through punitive measures.    
“This speaks to the issue of how we fund the judicial process in Louisiana,” Zeringue said in an interview. “We need to get away from focusing on fines and fees to fund the essential parts of the judicial system.”  
Steven Procopio, head of the nonpartisan Public Affairs Research Council of Louisiana, notes that any changes to the laws that dictate what fees justices of the peace collect could have a ripple effect on state resources. Denying access to the fees for salaries might also impact how these low-level courts pay for their operating costs.
“To address it though, it means you have to find other sources of revenue that aren’t fee-based. That usually means state funding,” Procopio said.

(Image by Getty Images)The Trump administration started withholding federal funding to health care providers in Maine on Tuesday under what’s known as Title X, the country’s only federally funded program that supports family planning services. 
Grantees are eyeing legal action, as they say the freeze will limit essential care for tens of thousands of Mainers and amounts to a backdoor attack on reproductive rights, even though Title X does not fund abortion.
Family planning services include contraception, testing and treatment for sexually transmitted infections and cancer screenings, among others. Providers in the Title X network have never been able to use the funds for abortion services, however those who offer such services are eligible to receive and use the funds for family planning services. 
Maine Family Planning, Maine’s statewide grantee for Title X funding, received a notice from the Office of the Assistance Secretary for Health at the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services on Monday informing the organization that all of its Title X funding would be temporarily withheld beginning Tuesday, amounting to a total of $1.925 million, according to Maine Family Planning spokesperson Kat Mavengere.
George Hill, president and CEO of Maine Family Planning, which distributes some of the funding to other providers in the state, said in a statement that any delay in the disbursement of federal grants will have a detrimental impact on patients. 
“Maine Family Planning’s funding application adheres to the current requirements of the Title X program and regulations, which encompass health equity,” Hill said. “As the statewide Title X grantee, we refuse to compromise expert care that Mainers have relied on for more than 50 years.”
Hill said the organization is prepared to fight back against attacks on its ability to serve Mainers, including litigating to defend the rights of the Title X family planning network.
Maine Family Planning and its subgrantees, including Planned Parenthood, serve roughly 31,000 patients across the state each year.
“Title X doesn’t even cover abortion funding, so this is a blatant attempt to push a political agenda and impose beliefs about health care on everyone,” Lisa Margulies, vice president of public affairs for Planned Parenthood Maine Action Fund, told Maine Morning Star. “And the truth is that Title X makes health care affordable for so many people who desperately need it.” 
The freeze equates to roughly $400,000 annually for Planned Parenthood in Maine, Margulies said. Last fiscal year, Planned Parenthood served 6,468 Title X patients in the state. 
Maine Family Planning and Planned Parenthood expected Title X funding to be restricted during President Donald Trump’s second term, given the limits he’d implemented during his last presidency. 
Previously, Trump barred providers from so much as mentioning abortion care to patients if they wanted to continue receiving the funding, what critics referred to as the “domestic gag rule,” which led Maine Family Planning to drop out of the Title X network. Former President Joe Biden reversed the rule in 2021.
“This is kind of a different flavor of attack than we’ve seen previously,” Margulies said, “but it gets at the same goal, which is to defund Planned Parenthood and defund abortion providers more generally.” 
These federal actions underscore the need for more state funding, Margulies said, pointing to the bill being considered by the Maine Legislature to increase state allocations for family planning services. 
During the first week of his second term, Trump also reinstated a global version of this gag rule, which prevents nongovernmental organizations that receive federal global health funding from providing access to abortion-related information and care. Maine’s congressional delegation reintroduced a bill to permanently repeal it.
Also this week, the U.S. Supreme Court is hearing its first abortion case since Trump’s reelection to settle whether states can bar Planned Parenthood from receiving Medicaid funds — which could further the administration’s goal of “defunding” the nation’s largest family planning provider.

The conflict between the state of Maine and the Trump administration over transgender student athletes reached a new pivot point on Monday. As the first of several deadlines set by the federal government has now expired, whether Maine can continue to allow trans athletes to participate in sports appears likely to be decided by the courts.
Two separate federal agencies determined that Maine is in violation of Title IX based on the Trump administration’s interpretation of the anti-sex discrimination protection.
The U.S. Department of Education’s Office for Civil Rights issued a final warning Monday to the Maine Department of Education regarding its noncompliance with a federal directive for allowing trans girls to participate in girls sports.
If the state does not propose an agreement that’s acceptable to the office by April 11, the case will be referred to the Department of Justice, the letter said.
Meanwhile, a separate investigation by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services’ civil rights office that found Maine in violation of Title IX for “continuing to unlawfully allow” trans girls to compete in girls sports has been referred to the U.S. Department of Justice, according to a Monday social media post from the agency.
In a letter dated March 17, HHS had given Maine a deadline of 10 days to comply with federal guidance. Monday marked 10 business days from that warning.

Both agencies determined that Maine had violated federal law after dayslong investigations that included no interviews, while typical investigations take months and are eventually settled with resolution agreements. The probes were launched after Maine Gov. Janet Mills, a Democrat, and President Donald Trump had a heated exchange over the state’s trans athlete policy. Millions of dollars in federal funding might be at risk, depending on how the cases proceed.
“We just need an answer at this point as to, ‘Does the Trump administration have the authority to do what it’s doing when it comes to fast-tracking the removal of federal funds?’” said Jackie Wernz, a former OCR lawyer for the Education Department who now represents school districts nationwide in these types of cases.
“This is just unprecedented, and we’re not following the process that we’re used to. So I think it’s going to be really helpful for courts to start weighing in on whether or not they have the authority to do this.”
On March 19, the Department of Education’s civil rights office notified Maine of its noncompliance and proposed a resolution agreement that would require the state to rescind its support for trans athletes, which is currently required by the Maine Human Rights Act. A Cumberland-area school district and the Maine Principals Association, which runs student athletics, that were also found in violation have already refused to sign the agreement.
This development is part of a broader effort by the Trump administration to enforce Title IX provisions concerning gender and athletics. Earlier this year, the administration launched investigations in several other states for similar policies allowing trans athletes to compete in alignment with their gender identity.
Title IX, the federal law banning sex-based discrimination, does not reference trans people directly, but the Trump administration has interpreted Maine’s policy as discrimination against cisgender girls.
Rachel Perera, a fellow in the governance studies program for the Brown Center on Education Policy at national think tank the Brookings Institution, said the Trump administration’s interpretation of Title IX leaves room for questioning. If the policy goes to trial, she said federal courts may come up with a clearer interpretation.
“It’s going to be really important to see how Maine proceeds, because they’re sort of setting the tone in terms of these other states and other localities who are going to be trying to navigate these very same dynamics,” she said.

(Photo by George Frey/Getty Images)Washington was among 23 states that sued the Trump administration Tuesday over the cancellation of $12 billion in federal funding to address infectious diseases, substance abuse and mental illness, including about $160 million for Washington.
The lawsuit comes on the heels of the abrupt termination last week of grants related to disease tracking, vaccination efforts and other work that officials said could cost thousands of jobs in public health departments nationwide. This pot of money makes up $11 billion of the $12 billion cut. 
The cuts in Washington reportedly include $118 million for the Epidemiology and Laboratory Capacity for Prevention and Control of Emerging Infectious Diseases program, impacting 150 full-time employees. Losing this money will hurt the state’s ability to respond to emerging outbreaks, including measles and bird flu, according to the complaint.
That money also continued to support COVID-related surveillance efforts, the lawsuit says.  
In total, Washington’s Department of Health stands to lose around $130 million, an agency spokesperson said last week, with the termination affecting upward of 200 department employees, and more at local health departments, tribal health clinics and community-based organizations.
One of the specific programs affected is Care Connect, which the department launched early in the pandemic to provide food and other needs to people with COVID so they could isolate. The program later shifted to meet the needs of those suffering from long COVID, among other things.
Washington Attorney General Nick Brown also cites the state’s Care-A-Van mobile health clinics that provide vaccinations and other services to underserved communities. Officials have already had to cancel clinics due to the lost funding. 
The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services rolled back the grants “for cause” because “the pandemic is over,” so the funding is no longer needed, according to the lawsuit. The states counter that the money was never intended to only be used to respond to the COVID pandemic.
The lawsuit also tackles the separate but simultaneous Trump administration axing of another $1 billion in Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration funding, including $34 million for Washington. 
Brown is one of several attorneys general leading Tuesday’s lawsuit, filed in U.S. District Court in Rhode Island. The Department of Health and Human Services and Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. are named as defendants. The department didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment Tuesday.
“We can’t make America healthy by spreading preventable diseases,” Brown said. “Aside from the illegality of these actions, the administration is also choosing to neglect the biggest public health challenges, including substance abuse and mental health crises, facing our communities.”
The states say the cuts violate the Administrative Procedure Act by suddenly terminating the grants without much explanation. The plaintiffs asked a judge for a temporary restraining order to reverse the cuts. 
The state Department of Health’s now-canceled federal grant dollars were expected to expire between June 2025 and July 2026, agency spokesperson Marisol Mata Somarribas said.
Also on Tuesday, the Department of Health and Human Services began its purge of 10,000 federal workers.
As part of the layoff announcement, Kennedy also said he’d be halving the number of Health and Human Services regional offices from 10 to five. Seattle’s office serves Washington, Oregon, Idaho and Alaska. Its fate was unclear Tuesday.
This is at least the 8th lawsuit Brown has led or joined against the Trump administration since January.

Deep cuts to Medicaid are being debated on Capitol Hill right now. Lawmakers could slash federal funding for state programs, force enrollees to work to keep their coverage or kick those who qualified under expansions off the rolls, among the options on the table.
The U.S. House of Representatives, narrowly controlled by Republicans, passed a bill last month requiring the Committee on Energy and Commerce to find $880 billion in spending cuts over a decade — a necessity to extend tax cuts that mostly benefit the wealthy. The committee oversees Medicaid, which means some aspects of the program will likely be on the chopping block.
What kind of cuts are we most likely to see? And what could they mean for vulnerable — and even well-off — people in the Pittsburgh region?
We asked Marian Jarlenski, a professor at the University of Pittsburgh’s School of Public Health and associate director of CONVERGE@Pitt, a research center that studies sexual and reproductive health. She’s an expert on Medicaid whose research explores how its policies and programs could improve pregnancy and reproductive health outcomes. Her team built this dashboard that offers a snapshot of Medicaid reliance in congressional districts nationwide. It shows that about 174,000 people in Pennsylvania’s 12th congressional district — which includes the City of Pittsburgh and is represented by Democrat Rep. Summer Lee — are enrolled in Medicaid and the state’s Children’s Health Insurance Program [CHIP].
Medicaid is jointly funded by the federal government and states, with each state administering its own program. The generosity of those programs can vary, but Jarlenski said Pennsylvania’s program is fairly robust. It covers kids with disabilities regardless of household income, connects people leaving jails and prisons with care, and integrates parts of Medicare and Medicaid plans for those who qualify for both.
Those “innovative programs” could now be at risk, she said. “It’s hindering our ability in Pennsylvania to move forward … and think of new ways to address public health. Instead, [we’ll be] on the defensive and saying, ‘Where can we cut?’”
The following conversation was edited for length and clarity.
Q: Medicaid cuts can take many forms. Which ones would cause the most damage?
This is a tough question to answer because we don’t know the details of how cuts would be implemented. But the three main cuts that Congress could consider would be:
1) Imposing a work requirement, which makes each person document their work status. The evidence shows it doesn’t increase employment, but instead creates more red tape and causes people to lose their benefits.
2) The block grant option. The federal government gives a lump sum of money to states, and states decide how to allocate the money. Typically, the lump sum would grow more slowly than the cost of medical care would grow. And so over time, states could have to limit who’s on Medicaid. Waiting lists for benefits existed before the Affordable Care Act [ACA]. We had what’s known as ‘state-only programs’ and the funding for them was restricted. This happened in Oregon, which had a waiting list for the Oregon Health Plan because there just wasn’t enough money to cover everyone.
I think the brute force of this cut would cause the most damage. It would make it really infeasible for Pennsylvania and other states to provide the kind of benefits they do now. And that’s why 20% of adults were uninsured in the United States before the ACA allowed Medicaid expansion. Because it’s just so cost-prohibitive for each state to go it alone.
3) And the third potential option is cutting off the federal match for the Medicaid expansion population. (The ACA allows states to expand coverage to adults with incomes up to 138% of the federal poverty level.) In Pennsylvania, the Medicaid expansion population is low-income adults who don’t have dependent children, and many low-income parents who have dependent children. The federal government pays 90% of the cost of this group’s Medicaid insurance, and cutting that off would increase the state’s spending burden. The increased pressure on our state budget could have negative spillover effects in other areas, such as education, transportation, economic development, all those big-ticket items.
Q: A fifth of Allegheny County residents rely on Medicaid. And your lab’s dashboard shows that more than 174,000 people in the congressional district that includes the City of Pittsburgh rely on Medicaid and CHIP. How do those numbers compare to what we’re seeing on a national level?
Our county and congressional district line up pretty closely with the national average. More than 20% of Americans are enrolled in Medicaid. Who are they? Working class and poor people who need health insurance. It also includes pregnant patients, a lot of kids, and importantly, people in long-term care settings who spent all their assets paying for those services. So a lot of middle- and even upper-middle class people will rely on Medicaid for their long-term care needs in old age.
Also, about a third of births in Allegheny County are covered by Medicaid. And we have a new policy in Pennsylvania: Any baby whose birth is covered by Medicaid is now automatically enrolled in the program through age 6, which is really exciting. But these cuts would put the health insurance of pregnant women and kids up to age 6 at risk.
Q: I want to pick up the thread on older adults with different class backgrounds needing Medicaid. We know that Medicare generally won’t pay for nursing home care, but Medicaid will. Our county has a higher concentration of older adults than most other large counties in the country. Could these cuts have a disproportionate impact here because of that?
I think it depends on the type of cuts. Some of the proposals to cut Medicaid would exempt people with disabilities, including long-term care residents. For example, a work requirement would not apply to them. … If we’re going into a block grant or limiting per-person spending, it would absolutely hurt the ability of nursing homes in our area to serve all. It can cost up to $100,000 a year per person for nursing home care, not counting additional health care in the hospital and things that may be paid for by Medicare. So I definitely would be concerned if we’re talking about limiting spending per person, or an overall block grant, for the feasibility of nursing homes to continue to serve the population.
Q: You study Medicaid’s impact on pregnancy and reproductive health outcomes. We know that maternal and infant health outcomes are worse for Black people than their white counterparts in the county. Could these cuts exacerbate the disparities?
That’s an excellent question. Before I answer it, I want to emphasize that Medicaid coverage is the same regardless of your race or ethnicity. But because of social and historical factors, such as redlining, we see in the demographic data that people of color might be more likely to be working class and belong to low-income households in Allegheny County. So we do see a slightly higher rate of Medicaid coverage in populations of color.
Medicaid is the single largest program in pregnancy and reproductive health space, so I feel it could really incentivize health care systems or Medicaid health plans to focus on interventions to reduce health disparities. If it’s a big part of the population you serve, you’re going to notice and document the disparities and try to take action to intervene on those. So in that sense, Medicaid coverage is the floor on which we could build interventions to address health disparities and ensure that everybody has high quality care and good pregnancy outcomes. If that floor goes away, those systems will be scrambling for basic insurance coverage instead of trying to build a better future.
Q: We know that Medicaid can be a lifeline for people with disabilities — especially if their disabilities prevent them from working or if they need assistance with daily living. About 11% of Pittsburghers have disabilities. How could these cuts affect them?

There are people with disabilities who receive Supplemental Security Income, which automatically qualifies them for Medicaid. Typically, a work requirement [for Medicaid enrollees] would exempt those people. Then there are people who have some kind of condition that would be disabling in their daily life, but don’t have an official disability determination. And those folks, of course, would be subject to work requirements.
The other thing I want to say is that people with a disability determination have to stay under a certain income threshold to keep their benefits. So even if people want to work full time or be promoted, they can’t do that because they have to keep their income low enough to qualify. That’s a problem that disability advocates have been talking about for probably 40 years. It has not been fixed yet, and cutting benefits is certainly not going to fix it. Like those in nursing homes, people with disabilities often have complex and expensive health care needs. So any proposal to limit per-person spending or give a block grant is going to hurt the medical system’s ability to serve them.
Q: Health care facilities power a big part of Pittsburgh’s economy. I imagine these cuts would significantly impact medical billing at hospitals and in the broader health systems, which employ so many people here. 
That’s right. It would have spillover effects on the economy and jobs. Health care is a large part of our economy in Pennsylvania. And health care work is the second-most common type of job among people who are enrolled in Medicaid. So people who work as home-care attendants or as medical techs or in long-term care facilities tend to have working-class incomes, and they are actually covered by Medicaid. So it’s all tied together.
Q: The Trump administration vowed not to cut Medicaid and said the budget resolution would only target “waste and fraud in entitlement spending.” Republicans in Congress have echoed that. Experts said this is misleading, and that it’s impossible to achieve $880 billion in savings without slashing Medicaid. How is waste and fraud controlled, and do we need these cuts to do it better?    
What we tend to see is fraudulent billing to Medicare or Medicaid managed care plans. A common type of fraud or abuse involves [a provider] creating a fake patient profile and billing for them. I think we can all agree that fraud is bad — I can say that unequivocally. We would all support more fraud investigation funding, and you would think the federal government would be adding jobs to the Department of Health and Human Services rather than cutting them if it wanted to beef up the workload.
The [U.S. Department of Health and Human Services] put out a report last week that actually found that Pennsylvania had the highest number of Medicaid fraud and abuse claims. They had investigated around 19,000 claims. (The state also ranked third in convictions of those who abuse its Medicaid program.) So I feel like our program is doing a pretty good job at combating fraud and abuse, and so I’m not really sure what else we can be doing there. We’re No. 1 in the nation.
Q: What can state and local policymakers do to mitigate the damage? 
Well, it’s really hard because you need to fund a Medicaid program at scale. Most of our income taxes go to the federal government. And a lot of it comes back through these state and federal programs.
One option would be for states to band together to get that scale. There is a mechanism called an interstate compact. It’s been done around water rights and things of that nature, but I don’t see why that type of agreement can’t be developed for medical assistance. I think we need to draw on the expertise of people in our region, in health care and education, to think of the most creative ideas. Absent that, I think everybody has a role to play in educating elected officials about the importance of these programs to our economy and, obviously, to people’s health. Because how devastating would it be if you had a health condition and weren’t able to get care for it?

More than $91 million of these cuts is due to last week’s termination of six federal grants, according to the Maine Department [&#8230;]","The entrance to the Maine Department of Health and Human Services in Augusta. Feb. 25, 2025.( Photo: Jim Neuger/ Maine Morning Star)Maine is facing a barrage of healthcare cuts, possibly losing as much as $93 million in federal funding to a wide array of services, from vaccinations and disease tracking to mental and reproductive health.
More than $91 million of these cuts is due to last week’s termination of six federal grants, according to the Maine Department of Health and Human Services. Three million is in separate cuts to Title X, the country’s only federally funded program that supports family planning services. 
Attorney General Aaron Frey announced that the state is joining a multi-state lawsuit, along with attorneys general from 23 states and the District of Columbia, against the Trump administration for “abruptly and illegally terminating” funding.
The legal challenge was filed in U.S. District Court in Rhode Island against the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services and HHS Secretary Robert F. Kennedy, Jr. for withholding nearly $11 billion in “critical public health grants” to the states, according to a statement from Frey’s office.
Vaccine distribution, disease monitoring and response and rural health services, among other programs, are at risk if funding is not restored.
According to the Maine Department of Health and Human Services, the terminated grants directly impacted work by more than 70 vendors and at least 40 contracted personnel at Maine Center for Disease Control and Prevention.
“The termination of these grants will compromise Maine’s ability to respond to disease outbreaks, maintain vaccine availability, address health disparities, and support community-based health workforce efforts,” said Maine DHHS Commissioner Sara Gagné-Holmes. “Additionally, these cuts threaten critical planned investments in mental health and substance use disorder services. Maine DHHS is continuing to evaluate the full impact of these cuts to these important public health and behavioral services.”
Most of the funding cuts — about $88 million — affect the Maine CDC and will impact vaccination programs, making it harder to distribute vaccines and educate the public; reduce the state’s ability to monitor outbreaks and run lab tests; cut health equity programs meant to help vulnerable communities and terminate community health services, according to DHHS.
About $3 million will be cut from Maine’s Office of Behavioral Health, impacting substance use prevention programs, and school-based mental health and interventions.
“These actions jeopardize critical public health response capabilities and services, and weaken our state’s public health infrastructure,” said Dr. Puthiery Va, Director of the Maine CDC. 
Congress approved extra funding for health programs during COVID-19, including mental health and addiction services. But on March 24, without legal justification, the federal government suddenly cut off these funds, saying they were no longer needed since the pandemic is over.
Frey and other attorneys general are arguing that these cuts are illegal. They say the funding was never meant to end just because the pandemic officially ended over a year ago, and some of the grants weren’t permitted to be canceled this way.
The lawsuit is asking the court to block the funding cuts and stop the government from enforcing or reinstating them, claiming the decision violates federal law.

DCF operates a 24-hour abuse hotline, but refers calls to law enforcement outside weekday business hours and on weekends. (Sherman Smith/Kansas Reflector)TOPEKA — The Kansas child advocate urged the Kansas Legislature to narrow the front door to state custody of children by striking a better balance between harm individuals could face by remaining in a home versus trauma resulting from removal from that residence.
Kansas child advocate Kerrie Lonard said lack of clarity in definitions of neglect and harm led to inconsistent removal decisions by the Kansas Department for Children and Families and the state courts. On Monday, she told the Joint Committee on Child Welfare System Oversight the challenge extended to law enforcement officers making protective custody decisions about children potentially in harm’s way.
Lonard said reports suggested Kansas relied too heavily on police officers and sheriff deputies to make time-critical determinations about the welfare of children. They were drawn into this role with limited information about families and, in some areas of the state, lack of access to alternative services.
“Kansas is relying on law enforcement to not only act as public safety officer, but also that of a social worker,” Lonard said.
Lonard said questions had been raised in Kansas about the percentage of children being removed from homes by law enforcement. Questions also have been posed about whether child trauma could be reduced if DCF personnel were more readily available to be involved in removal decisions, she said.
Lonard said DCF’s protection center hotline operated 24 hours a day, but after-hour calls regarding the possibility of a child in imminent danger were referred to law enforcement. DCF staff was available 40 hours per week to make decisions on child safety and removal,  which left 128 hours per week to be managed primarily by law enforcement officers.
“Law enforcement does not have in-real-time access to DCF resources or historical information to enable consideration of safely vetted alternative options that would prevent children from being placed into police protective custody,” she said.
 
Wichita region dominates
DCF deputy secretary Tanya Keys said the 10-county region of the state that included Wichita had 47.1% of the state’s police protective custody placements in fiscal year 2024. In terms of the other five regions of the state, the proportion of protective custody cases ranged from 7.3% in the northwest to 12.7% in the southwest.
In other words, 1,182 of the 2,509 Kansas children placed in protective custody by law enforcement in the last fiscal year were in the Wichita region.
In addition, Keys said, the Kansas Department of Corrections reported 39% of children dropped off at juvenile facilities last fiscal year by law enforcement officers across the state were subsequently released to a family member.
“Forty percent of those children are returned to a parent or relative. That’s their placement outcome after a juvenile intake an assessment worker is alongside that family,” Keys said.
The Legislature unanimously voted last week to send Gov. Laura Kelly a bill amending state law concerning when officers could take a child under 18 into custody for suspected abuse or neglect. Under House Bill 2075, Kansas law enforcement officers would be required to explore other options for shielding a child from harm before turning to protective police custody.
The bill also would add a more direct procedure for law enforcement to report suspected neglect or abuse of a child to DCF for purposes of investigation.
 
Real-time decisions
Ron Paschal, the deputy district attorney in Sedgwick County responsible for the Child In Need of Care division, said the state should be wary of latching onto a set of statistics and deciding too many children were being taken into protective custody by law enforcement agencies.
He said a significant portion of children in protective custody were later returned home, but that didn’t mean initial decisions of law enforcement officers were flawed.
“We can all agree in a perfect world no child should experience removal from home. We all agree that is a traumatic experience,” Paschal said. “But, I think, if we look at the reality, sadly, many children’s lives and safety are at risk at home.”
Former Topeka police chief Ed Klumpp, who lobbies on behalf of three law enforcement associations in Kansas, said the power to place a child in protective custody wasn’t used by officers without exploration of other solutions.
“Taking a child into police protective custody can be traumatic not only for the child and family, but also to the officer,” Klumpp said.
Klumpp said the issue came before the Legislature due to assertions Kansas’ use of police protective custody might be high compared to other states. He said he wasn’t aware of data supporting the conclusion protective custody was used in Kansas when it was “not justified based on information available to the officer at the time of the decision.”
He agreed DCF’s limited availability from 8 a.m. to 5 p.m. Monday through Friday required law enforcement officers to grapple with a heavy load in terms of child protection. DCF should be more engaged in the custody process outside normal business hours especially when there was no criminal element to a case, he said.
He also recommended Kansas develop a risk assessment tool for use by law enforcement when determining whether a child could safely be left in the home.",https://kansasreflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/P1240879-1024x576.jpg,,,2025-04-01 13:10:37.022648

(Justin Sullivan/Getty Images)Under an emerging Republican plan to require some Medicaid recipients to work, between 4.6 million and 5.2 million adults ages 19 to 55 could lose their health care coverage, according to a new analysis.
The study, conducted by Urban Institute researchers with support from the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation, calculated that up to 39% of the 13.3 million adults in that age group who became eligible for Medicaid when their states expanded the program under the Affordable Care Act would lose coverage if Congress required states to impose work rules.
The report suggests that most of those people would lose coverage not because they aren’t complying with the rules, but because they would struggle to report their compliance to the state.

“Most adults who would lose eligibility for federal Medicaid funding are working, engaged in work-related activities, or could qualify for exemptions not readily identifiable through state databases but could still face disenrollment because of the reporting requirements,” it states. The study identified several barriers to reporting, including lack of broadband access and lack of transportation.
Forty states plus the District of Columbia have expanded Medicaid under the ACA. Overall, nearly 72 million people, about a fifth of Americans, are enrolled in the program for low-income people, which is funded jointly by the federal government and the states.

Traditional Medicaid insurance was mainly available to children and their caregivers, people with disabilities and pregnant women. But the ACA, commonly known as Obamacare, allowed states to extend coverage to adults making up to 138% of the federal poverty level — about $21,000 a year for a single person.
Nationwide, more than 21 million people with low incomes have health insurance because of expanded Medicaid eligibility.
U.S. House Republicans in February pushed through a budget plan, now under consideration in the Senate, that would require about $880 billion in cuts to Medicaid over the next decade to help cover the cost of $4.5 trillion in tax cuts. The budget doesn’t contain specifics on how that target would be met. But work requirements are a likely money-saving option: A 2023 analysis from the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office found that imposing work rules on Medicaid recipients ages 19 to 55 who are not parents or caregivers would cut federal spending by an estimated $109 billion over the next 10 years.
The Congressional Budget Office based that projection on a plan the GOP-controlled U.S. House approved in 2023. That bill, the likely blueprint for the work requirements Republicans are considering now, would have required adults ages 19-55 to work, participate in a job training program or perform community service for at least 80 hours per month for three or more months in a calendar year. Parents and caretakers of dependent children, and those unable to work because of a health condition, would have been exempt.
Many Republican-led states are eager to impose work requirements on able-bodied Medicaid recipients. Thirteen states received permission to impose work rules on at least some Medicaid enrollees during the first Trump administration. Nine additional states requested permission to enact Medicaid work requirements during Trump’s earlier term but had not won approval by the time it ended.
When the Biden administration came into office, it rescinded all the approvals.
Supporters say requiring Medicaid recipients to work, study or train for a career gives them a boost toward self-sufficiency and financial stability. Critics, however, say such rules end up hurting far more people than they help.

The researchers from the Urban Institute mostly based their analysis on the experience of Arkansas, which in June 2018 became the first state to require some Medicaid recipients to work, volunteer, go to school or participate in job training to receive benefits. By the time a federal judge halted the policy in April 2019, 18,000 adults had lost coverage.
The researchers also looked at New Hampshire, which began implementing a work requirement but halted the program in July 2019 before suspending anyone’s coverage.
“What was found in a lot of qualitative research on the previous work requirement programs is that a lot of people were unaware of the policy, or they didn’t understand the policy,” said Michael Karpman, an Urban Institute researcher who co-authored the study.
“People who need coverage the most would do the most to try to maintain it. On the other hand, those people could also face the most difficulty with the administrative barriers,” Karpman said.
In a 2020 study examining how Arkansas’ last experience with work requirements played out, researchers from the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health “found no evidence that the policy succeeded in its stated goal of promoting work and instead found substantial evidence of harm to health care coverage and access.”
Arkansas Republican Gov. Sarah Huckabee Sanders announced in January that she would ask the federal government for permission to institute work requirements, regardless of what Congress decides. The state submitted the request last week.










Especially for a rural state like Arkansas, work requirements fail to take into account a lot of the realities that people may face.


– Christin Harper, policy director for Arkansas Advocates for Children and Families


Arkansas Republican state Rep. Aaron Pilkington, who serves on the health committee in his chamber, said lawmakers “learned our lesson from the last go-round.”
Pilkington said that under the new proposal, the state will only pause coverage instead of canceling it, giving recipients an opportunity to prove they are complying. And, he said, the online portal for reporting will be a lot more user-friendly.
“I think it’s a reasonable thing to ask for able-bodied people to look for work, or try to obtain work,” Pilkington said.
But Christin Harper, policy director for Arkansas Advocates for Children and Families, said even the new version would be a challenge for many enrollees. Many people on Medicaid are juggling multiple jobs, and having to report to the state every month would be a significant burden.
“Especially for a rural state like Arkansas, work requirements fail to take into account a lot of the realities that people may face,” Harper said. She added that “with the overall job market, job opportunities may or may not be available in some of these rural towns.”

As a result, Michigan’s Department of Education is reporting schools around the state will lose nearly $42 million of funding.
Pre-approved projects in 27 Michigan school districts for federal reimbursement were intended to improve air quality and safety in schools following the COVID-19 pandemic, State Superintendent Dr. Michael F. Rice said in a statement Monday. 
“Walking back a federal commitment to pandemic relief funds to improve the air quality, healthfulness, and safety of schools coming out of the pandemic is unacceptable,” Rice said.

The Department of Education under former President Joe Biden had approved extensions to the project reimbursement deadline to March 28, 2026, but with the sudden revocation, Rice said schools locked into contracts will have to cut other facets of education to foot the bill.
“A change in administrations should not void previous commitments,” Rice said. “Without the promised March 2026 date for federal reimbursement requests, districts may be forced to reduce instructional expenditures for students, diminish savings, or both to honor these contracts.”
Rice requested that Secretary McMahon reconsider her decision to cut off funding and implored Michigan’s congressional delegation, including U.S. Rep. Tim Walberg (R-Tipton) who chairs the House Education and the Workforce Committee, to act.
The previous administration’s extension “was not justified”, McMahon’s letter on Friday said, adding that state education leaders had “ample” time to receive reimbursement. 
McMahon added that it was an act of “grace” that the department had granted extensions for federal reimbursement and prior approval for projects does not override an agency’s autonomy to reconsider decisions. However, states can request extensions on individual projects, McMahon wrote, which would leave it at the department’s discretion to determine necessity.
“By failing to meet the clear deadline in the regulation, you ran the risk that the Department would deny your extension request. Extending deadlines for COVID-related grants, which are in fact taxpayer funds, years after the COVID pandemic ended is not consistent with the Department’s priorities and thus not a worthwhile exercise of its discretion,” McMahon wrote.
Some of the communities hit hardest by the COVID-19 pandemic and health care infrastructure will lose the most funding, the Michigan Department of Education reports.
Flint Community Schools will lose out on about $15.6 million in funding, the most in the state, while the city was one of the hardest hit in Michigan by the COVID-19 pandemic. Flint, where the residents were effectively poisoned by lead contamination in 2014 when the city switched its water supply source, creating years of health issues for the community, had the compounded strain during the COVID-19 pandemic as the city was a hotspot for the spread of the virus and residents were slow to receiving the vaccine. 
Other school districts slated to lose funding are Benton Harbor Area Schools, which still had about $4.5 million slotted for them, Hamtramck Public Schools at about $7.2 million and Pontiac School District at about $3.3 million.

The U.S. Department of Education walking back its commitment to health and safety projects is an affront, State Board of Education President Pamela Pugh said in a statement. Pugh, who served as the Chief Public Health Advisor for the City of Flint during the Flint Water Crisis, says she sees communities who are losing funding and recognizes that they are some of the communities who are in the most need of projects that help keep kids healthy. 
“These federally funded projects are important to students and staff in our districts in Michigan and across the country,” Pugh said. “To cancel funding approval on no notice and to tell districts that they may apply for a second approval from the U.S. Department of Education to access these funds, with different criteria, has nothing to do with service to schoolchildren.”

It’s Colorado’s first confirmed measles case since 2023 and just its third case in the last nine years. It comes amid an alarming rise in measles outbreaks nationwide, including several clusters in west Texas that have caused at least one death of an unvaccinated child. Falling rates of vaccination, fueled by anti-vaccine conspiracy theories like those spread by newly confirmed Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., have preceded many of those outbreaks.
Utah sees measles vaccination bump as outbreak spreads in nearby states

In a press release, the Colorado Department of Public Health and Environment said the Pueblo case was confirmed in an unvaccinated adult who had “recently traveled to an area of Mexico experiencing an ongoing measles outbreak.”
Measles is a highly contagious and often severe disease that causes symptoms including fever, cough and a characteristic rash. Cases in the U.S. plummeted following the introduction of a vaccine in the 1960s, and two doses of the combined measles, mumps and rubella, or MMR, vaccine provides about 97% protection against infection.
Colorado had the nation’s sixth-lowest rate of MMR vaccine coverage for kindergarteners in the 2023-24 school year, with an estimated only 88.3% of kindergarten students vaccinated, according to federal data. State law requires K-12 students to receive the MMR vaccine and five others, but allows for broad exemptions on medical or religious grounds.
​​“Measles is one of the most contagious diseases we know, but it is also highly preventable,” Dr. Rachel Herlihy, Colorado’s deputy chief medical officer and state epidemiologist, said in a statement. “The MMR vaccine provides excellent protection and helps prevent outbreaks like the one we are seeing globally. We urge Coloradans to review their vaccination status and take steps to protect themselves, their families, and their communities.”
Based on initial information, CDPHE officials say that Pueblo residents who visited the Southwest Deli and Cafe at 1873 S. Pueblo Blvd. between March 17 and March 21, or the Southern Colorado Clinic at 109 South Burlington Drive on the afternoon of March 22, may have been exposed to measles. People who were exposed should monitor for symptoms for at least three weeks after exposure and avoid public gatherings, especially if they are unvaccinated.

The proposal, HB 955, from Seminole Republican Rep. Berny Jacques, would expand the use of E-Verify, the system that public agencies, their contractors, and companies with more than 25 employees must use to confirm their new hires are authorized to work.
Unlike the other two bills expanding E-Verify requirements, Jacques’ proposal doesn’t bring additional fines and penalties against employers hiring immigrants without work permits. However, HB 955 is the only E-Verify bill that has moved in the Florida Legislature this year.
“It’s not a gotcha mission. It’s to make sure we’re compliant, and we wanna make sure that those who are in this country working are authorized to do so,” Jacques said during the House Industries and Professional Activities Subcommittee meeting.
The sponsor, a Haitian immigrant, insisted his bill is not about immigrant workers.
“One of the things I want to highlight before I end my close is to not conflate immigrant workers with what we’re talking about here,” Jacques said. “Just because you’re an immigrant doesn’t mean you’re not authorized to work.”
Some Democrats warn stricter E-Verify requirements could drive workforce away

Gov. Ron DeSantis gave an early nod of approval to HB 955 before the legislative session started. Still, the proposal drew criticism over its lack of additional penalties from Senate Democratic Leader Jason Pizzo, who is sponsoring a dueling bill imposing tens of thousands of dollars in fines and loss of business licenses for companies hiring immigrants unauthorized to work in the country.
Spring Hill Republican Sen. Blaise Ingoglia also proposed a bill, SB 1498, that would add penalties for those employers and require all companies to use E-Verify.
More than 441,000 Florida companies have fewer than 20 employees, according to a 2023 report from the Office of Advocacy at the U.S. Small Business Administration, meaning that they don’t have to use E-Verify.
The Florida Department of Commerce can already fine employers $1,000 per day if they get caught not using E-Verify three times within two years. Companies hiring people unauthorized to work get placed on probation for a year.
Orlando Democratic Rep. Anna Eskamani said she was concerned about the national trend of branding immigrants without legal status as dangerous and criminals.
“Of course, we want every business to go through these proceedings and to ensure these are workers with visas and so forth, but we also know that the immigration system is dramatically broken,” Eskamani said.
“There are folks who have a visa, and then it expires, and the process to renew is very limited. And these are folks who are also paying taxes, they’re contributing to our economy and, beyond an unregulated status, they’re not dangerous.”
The bill has one more committee stop before reaching the House floor.
“We’re going to fight and see it through to the very end, and the ball will be in the Senate’s court as to what they want to do,” Jacques told Florida Phoenix.

(Photo by Bill Lucia/Washington State Standard)The Washington state House passed its budget just after midnight on Tuesday, setting the stage for negotiations with the Senate and the governor on a spending blueprint to address a looming multi-billion dollar shortfall.
The House approved the two-year $77.8 billion operating budget on a 54-44 vote in which five Democrats joined all Republicans in opposition. 
The decision followed a roughly six-hour debate in which majority Democrats rejected more than two dozen Republican amendments to curb taxes and fees, boost special education funding, improve health care services and halt the proposed closure of a women’s prison.
The plan spends roughly $5.3 billion more than the current budget. Of that, $920 million is for new policies on top of the sum needed to pay for rising costs of current programs and uphold statutory obligations. The spending plan leaves $1.7 billion in reserves at the end of the first fiscal year and $3.2 billion by the end of the biennium.
Washington’s next budget cycle begins July 1 and runs through June 30, 2027.
To balance their proposal, House Democrats pencil in $5.2 billion from a revenue package that includes removing the 1% cap on annual growth in property tax collections, adding a surcharge on large corporations and financial institutions, and levying a new and untested tax on wealth that is similar, but not identical, to one proposed in the Senate.
Those new dollars will prevent deeper reductions to critical state programs and services, Democrats said.
“An all-cuts budget would be catastrophic. People will die,” said Rep. Mia Gregerson, D-SeaTac, who was part of the Democrat budget writing team.
Rep. Timm Ormsby, D-Spokane, chair of the House Appropriations Committee, said the budget  “is what we were able to do with the resources we have. This is a budget that puts people first.”
Republicans said the new taxes and higher fees will hit working families hardest. Several cited the proposal to lift the 1% cap on annual property tax collections as maybe the most harmful.
“This budget doesn’t just tax the wealthy. It taxes every day working residents,” said Rep. April Connors, R-Kennewick. “Enough is enough. My constituents need real tax relief. We should stop using them as a bottomless ATM.”
House Minority Leader Drew Stokesbary, R-Auburn, said the budget spends more than it brings in. And the tax package, he said, is too large and will drive jobs out of state.
“This budget is the wrong direction for Washington state,” he said.
On Saturday, the Senate passed its $78.5 billion operating budget. It relies on nearly $6.2 billion from a four-year, $17 billion package of tax changes drawn up by Democrats that has yet to be voted on.
It contains measures similar to those in the House to increase the cap on annual growth in property tax collections and to tax wealthy individuals. The Senate also wants to impose a new tax on the payrolls of large companies, axe several tax breaks and reduce the sales tax rate. 
With the passage of budgets in each chamber, negotiations can begin in earnest to reconcile differences in the spending approaches.
House and Senate budget writers will also need to work with Gov. Bob Ferguson, a first-term Democrat, who has pressed lawmakers to reduce spending before considering new taxes to deal with the shortfall.
Ferguson is expected to share his thoughts on each budget at a news conference Tuesday afternoon.
The governor and Democratic lawmakers estimate the shortfall to be in the $12 billion to $16 billion range over four years. The sum represents the amount needed to maintain current levels of service, pay for new and expanded programs authorized in previous budgets and cover the cost of new collective bargaining agreements with employee unions.
One of the largest cost-cutting moves in the House budget is a delay in the expansion of popular early learning and child care programs. The Senate takes a similar step.
But the House does not look to save money by furloughing state workers for up to 13 days or to balance by draining the state’s emergency savings, referred to as the rainy day fund. The Senate seeks to do both.
On the spending side, the House pledges about $1 billion less in new funding for special education and public school operating costs.
The House budget has $25 million — $12.5 million in each fiscal year — for grants to help local governments hire more law enforcement officers. They promise to make another $25 million available in the 2027-29 budget for a four-year total of $50 million. There’s nothing like this in the Senate plan. 
This will be an area to work out with Ferguson. In his inaugural address, the governor said he wanted $100 million for this purpose in the next two-year budget. “That idea was a cornerstone of my campaign for governor. Any budget I sign must include this funding,” he said.
Republican lawmakers in the House proposed an amendment to boost the amount for grants as the governor sought, but it was defeated.",https://washingtonstatestandard.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/washington-state-capitol-5-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-04-01 13:10:37.022648

But investors have shown they are nervous that Trump’s plan could result in a protracted trade war that ultimately will cost American consumers more.
  Economist Mike Walden (Photo: NC State University)
To get a better understanding of the Trump tariffs and their impact, NC Newsline recently sat down with Mike Walden, the William Neal Reynolds Distinguished Professor and Extension Economist at North Carolina State University.
Some answers have been edited for brevity and clarity. Click here to listen to our full radio interview with Prof. Mike Walden. 
NC Newsline: It certainly appears the mood of the American consumer is, if not, souring a little jittery. Before we get into talking about tariffs, do you have any sort of overarching observations?
Walden: Yes. In terms of mood, that is backed up by surveys of consumer sentiment, small business sentiment. They have gone down. I think that’s part of the reason is because of tariffs, which we’ll talk about. Also, I think that people had an expectation that when President Trump was elected we will automatically see prices go down. In fact, he promised that. That’s not what’s going to happen, unfortunately.
I get this question all the time when I give talks. But what’s going to happen is that the rate of increase of prices is going to slow. And we’ve seen that over the last couple of years. But people should not expect prices to go back to 2019 levels. And it has nothing to do with politics. It just is not the way the system works.
Then we have some other flashing points. Obviously, the stock market’s been down. That’s a reflection, I think, of all these other factors. Job growth seems to have slowed. Retail spending, which really drives the economy, that has slowed.
So yeah, there are a host of things here that’s causing some, I wouldn’t say fear, but certainly some anxiety about where the economy is going.
NC Newsline: I do want to ask about tariffs. Who’s for these tariffs other than the president? Is he addressing a constituency that actually wants this at this point?
Walden: Well, of course, I’m not a political scientist, but the way I view Donald Trump is he is a person, has his own views.
I think one of his impetuses is that he remembers the America of old, when we manufactured pretty much everything that we used in the country. That’s changed dramatically. Economists would argue, hey, if we can get something cheaper in another country, then why not?
But I think the president has some views that are anchored in the past.
I think he has a stronger case when you look at, most countries impose tariffs of some kind and some level. But if you look at the level of tariffs in other countries versus the U.S., we’re pretty much at the bottom in terms of the rate of tariffs that we’ve imposed. And this is all pre-Trump.
I think he views that as unfair. He has this notion of having reciprocal tariffs. If Europe has 3%, we’ll have 3%, not have Europe have 15% and we have 3%.
So, I think that’s another motivation. He has embarked on a strategy that he thinks is a good one to either threaten higher tariffs or actually impose higher tariffs and get the reaction of other countries.
Now, I will say in terms of his goal of bringing manufacturing back to the U.S., you don’t have to look any further than North Carolina. You’re old enough to remember when North Carolina had tobacco and cigarette manufacturing. We had a large textile and apparel and furniture industries. Those have been pretty much decimated because of cheaper costs in other countries.
  North Carolina was once prized for its ability to craft furniture. But Dr. Walden says cheaper prices in other countries decimated the industry. Rebuilding that manufacturing sector will not happen overnight, according to Walden. (Photo: Clayton Henkel/NC Newsline)
So even if the president wants to bring those back, they’re not gonna come back overnight.
There is a concern that the higher levels of tariffs will impose actually, ironically, higher cost on U.S. consumers because, the entity that pays the tariff is not the exporting company from a foreign country. It’s the importing company.
So, for example, if I sell toys and buy my toys from China and the president slaps a 25% tariff on what I buy from China. China does not pay those or the company in China does not pay them, I pay them. And usually what happens in that case, as you might expect, if my costs go up, if a business’s cost go up, they’re gonna’ try to pass those higher costs on to their buyers. So that’s where the rub comes here.
Even though we may get to the point where manufacturing comes back and other countries maybe eased their tariffs, there’s going to be this transition period that can be bumpy and it’s interesting that Trump administration has already sort of recognized that and some of the leverage they’ve used.
NC Newsline: What about just the ever-changing nature of it? It seems like one day there’s a tariff, the next day we’re pulling it back. This is inspiring counteractions by other nations. This is going to have an effect on these outcomes as well, I would assume.
Walden: Well, I guess the way I would interpret that is [that it’s] just the way Donald Trump operates — probably the way he operated when he was in the private sector, running the real estate companies. I think he wants to be unpredictable. He doesn’t want whatever group he’s dealing with — he doesn’t want them to be to anticipate what he’s going to do. And maybe that worked for him in the private sector. We’ll see if it works for him in the public sector.
NC Newsline: Speaking of agriculture, what about the price of eggs? And what about China – they’re a big soybean importer. Won’t that have an impact on North Carolina and U.S. farmers?
Walden: We are a big agricultural state. A lot of states in the country are big agricultural states. We are very good at producing a variety of agricultural products, as well as the country.
  Agriculture could also take a hit if other countries respond to Trump’s new tariffs. The move comes as most consumers would just like to see the price of eggs decline. (Photo: Clayton Henkel/NC Newsline)
A lot of that is consumed domestically, but a lot of it is sold to foreign countries because of our great ability to raise food. And I think China has already said, if we impose higher tariffs on China, China has been, for example, a big buyer of a lot of U.S. and North Carolina ag products. If we impose a higher tariff on China, like the toy example I was giving, they’re going to come back, and I think they already have come back and impose a higher tariff on our ag sellers.
So that’s another element in this whole combination here, what’s going on regarding the economy and tariffs.
It’s not just the foreign producers that are affected by that tariff, and it’s not just the importers in our countries that are affected by the tariff. It’s our producers also, because usually when you impose tariffs, if you go to a tariff war, if I can use that term, the other country is going to say, “okay, you’re raising your tariffs, we’re going to up the tariffs that we have on your products, and that’s where it hits our domestic industries.”
And here in North Carolina, it’s not just ag, it’s pharmaceuticals, it’s auto parts, there’s a whole variety of things that we export. I don’t have the exact number, but we’re in the multi billions of dollars in terms of exports going out of North Carolina.
NC Newsline: You wrote a piece for WRAL’s TechWire that used the ‘R word’ – recession. Is that something that’s seriously in play at this point?
Walden: If you take a poll of economists, it looks like about one in three economists right now are saying, it’s a very good chance we have a recession this year.
Let me back up and say, there’s a difference between the economy slowing down and there is a recession.
I do think we’re definitely in a slowdown phase of the economy. What that simply means, we’re still growing, but not growing as fast. You see that in the job numbers. We’re adding jobs, but not nearly as fast. We’ve actually seen a little bit of uptick in the unemployment rate. The recession means that you’re actually shrinking. We’re actually producing less. Not only do jobs not go up as fast, but they actually go down. The unemployment rate jumps. Most economists are not there yet, but I think the big worry, quite frankly, is why this talk has really jumped off the page is tariffs.
And what you’ve said earlier, the Trump administration seems to be very, very unpredictable in terms of we just don’t know where they’re going. I think that’s been the main reason why there have been some slumps in recent days on Wall Street.
The biggest thing investors don’t like is unpredictability. They don’t like that. They hate that.
That’s the word they hate most. President Trump likes tariffs the most. Unpredictability is word investors don’t like.
NC Newsline: What about the Department of Government Efficiency, the so-called Department of Government Efficiency that Elon Musk is apparently running in Washington. We’re having these massive cuts to — at least it looks like it — to federal employment, to grants and funding for universities and research. Is that going to have an impact on the economy?
Walden:  It’s going to have an impact. I don’t think it’s going to be big enough to cause a recession, but it’s clearly going to have an impact. And if you live in the DC area, you’re having a big impact. That could send the DC economy into recession, but outside the DC still impacts, but it’s going to be localized.
But we’ve already seen them here in North Carolina, particularly in the region where we lived, the Research Triangle part, because we a lot have a lot of private institutions.
We have public institutions that depend on federal grants, and many of those are being cut back, if not eliminated. Employment’s going down.
So that, again, I don’t think is enough to send our region into a recession, but it is a bump in the road.
It is going to mean that more people, perhaps, won’t have a job at least temporarily. That affects not just those families, but there’s a downstream effect.
If your family budget is cut because your job is one of the jobs cut, that means you have less to spend. So the grocery doesn’t get as much money. The people in retail stores don’t get as much money. So, you can have a slowdown in growth.
Clearly, this area is growing and will continue to grow, but the growth rate might be somewhat more modest because of what the DOGE plan is doing.",https://ncnewsline.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Tequila.jpg,,,2025-04-01 13:10:37.022648

The conflict between the state of Maine and the Trump administration over transgender student athletes reached a new pivot point on Monday. As the first of several deadlines set by the federal government has now expired, whether Maine can continue to allow trans athletes to participate in sports appears likely to be decided by the courts.
Two separate federal agencies determined that Maine is in violation of Title IX based on the Trump administration’s interpretation of the anti-sex discrimination protection. 
The U.S. Department of Education’s Office for Civil Rights issued a final warning Monday to the Maine Department of Education regarding its noncompliance with a federal directive for allowing trans girls to participate in girls’ sports.
If the state does not propose an agreement that’s acceptable to the office by April 11, the case will be referred to the Department of Justice, the letter said.
Meanwhile, a separate investigation by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services’ civil rights office that found Maine in violation of Title IX for “continuing to unlawfully allow” trans girls to compete in girl’s sports has been referred to the U.S. Department of Justice, according to a Monday social media post from the agency. 
In a letter dated March 17, HHS had given Maine a deadline of 10 days to comply with federal guidance. Monday marked ten business days from that warning. 
Both agencies determined that Maine had violated federal law after dayslong investigations that included no interviews, while typical investigations take months and are eventually settled with resolution agreements. The probes were launched after Gov. Janet Mills and President Donald Trump had a heated exchange over the state’s trans athlete policy. Millions of dollars in federal funding might be at risk, depending on how the cases proceed. 
“We just need an answer at this point as to, ‘Does the Trump administration have the authority to do what it’s doing when it comes to fast tracking the removal of federal funds?’” said Jackie Wernz, a former OCR lawyer for the Education Department who now represents school districts nationwide in these types of cases.
“This is just unprecedented, and we’re not following the process that we’re used to. So I think it’s going to be really helpful for courts to start weighing in on whether or not they have the authority to do this.”
On March 19, the Department of Education’s civil rights office notified Maine of its noncompliance and proposed a resolution agreement that would require the state to rescind its support of trans athletes, which is currently required by the Maine Human Rights Act. A Cumberland-area school district and the Maine Principals Association, which runs student athletics, that were also found in violation have already refused to sign the agreement. 
This development is part of a broader effort by the Trump administration to enforce Title IX provisions concerning gender and athletics. Earlier this year, the administration launched investigations in several other states for similar policies allowing trans athletes to compete in alignment with their gender identity. 
Title IX, the federal law banning sex-based discrimination, does not reference trans people directly, but the Trump administration has interpreted Maine’s policy as discrimination against cisgender girls. 
Rachel Perera, a fellow in the governance studies program for the Brown Center on Education Policy at national think tank The Brookings Institution, said the Trump administration’s interpretation of Title IX leaves room for questioning. If the policy goes to trial, she said federal courts may come up with a clearer interpretation.
“It’s going to be really important to see how Maine proceeds, because they’re sort of setting the tone in terms of these other states and other localities who are going to be trying to navigate these very same dynamics,” she said.

,Louisiana Illuminator,2025-04-01 16:01:10+00:00,Louisiana Illuminator,Will Louisiana teachers face a pay cut? No answers yet.,Julie O'Donoghue,,,,,https://lailluminator.com/2025/04/01/will-louisiana-teachers-face-a-pay-cut-no-answers-yet/,Are the governor and legislators willing to cut teachers compensation?,"Louisiana legislative leaders have said yet whether they will look at prevent public school teacher pay from being cut. (Klaus Vedfelt/Getty Images)Gov. Jeff Landry tied public school teacher pay to a constitutional amendment on budget and tax policies that failed spectacularly at the polls Saturday. 

Now the question is: Are the governor and legislators willing to cut teachers compensation? 
Landry’s budget proposal does not contain money for stipends of $2,000 and $1,000 that teachers and school support staff have received, respectively, over the past two years. They were relying on financial benefits reaped from Amendment 2 passing to help cover the cost of that compensation. 
With the amendment now scuttled, the governor and lawmakers would have to take money from other items in Landry’s budget to cover the expense. But it’s not clear what type of appetite they have to do so. 
Legislators in leadership declined to say Monday whether the state’s 59,000 public school teachers should expect a pay cut as a result of Amendment 2 not passing. 
“That is probably going to end up being the lynchpin of the session,” said Rep. Julie Emerson, R-Carencro, author of the failed Amendment 2. “I really don’t know how that is going to go.”
Keeping teacher pay level with the current year would be expensive. Lawmakers would have to find $200 million in Landry’s proposed budget to cover the expense of another temporary, yearly stipend or to make a similar permanent salary increase on July 1. 

Rep. Jack McFarland, R-Jonesboro, is asking legislators to let him know if funding the additional teacher pay is their primary concern. He is one of the state budget architects as the House Appropriations Committee chairman. 

“If [the lawmakers] priorities are the teachers’ stipends, then I’m going to have to know it,” McFarland said. “To do the stipend, I would have to look at everything in the budget.”
Even though teachers are facing potential pay cuts, Landry has included funding increases for other education initiatives in his budget. 
For example, he’s set aside an additional $50 million for a new private school voucher program called LA GATOR for the next academic year. The initiative will allow more than 5,000 students to use public money to attend private schools or to pay for other private school education expenses such as uniforms and tutoring. 
The average salary of a Louisiana teacher is already below that of other southern states. It was $54,248 for the 2022-23 school year, when the regional average was $59,145, according to the latest numbers from the Southern Regional Education Board. The additional $2,000, first awarded in the 2023-24 school year, was meant to bring teachers closer to that pay range. 
The decision to cut teacher pay would be especially unfortunate this year, said Ronnie Morris, president of the Louisiana’s Board of Elementary and Secondary Education. 

Louisiana made major gains in reading comprehension on national tests – larger than those seen in any other state this year. Morris said the state’s public school teachers are responsible for that success, which legislators and Landry have already celebrated, and they shouldn’t have their pay cut after reaching such a milestone, he said. 

“It would be a shame not to recognize our teachers for the work they’ve done to better position our state,” Morris said. “I think that’s the wrong message.”

Louisiana’s biggest teachers unions also endorsed the failed constitutional amendment that Landry and lawmakers were backing because of its ties to teacher pay. 

Louisiana legislators will begin to debate state budget priorities in their legislative session that starts April 14.SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE",https://lailluminator.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/KidsinSchool-scaled-1-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-04-01 12:15:41.852145

(Photo: Brandon Kingdollar/NC Newsline)The North Carolina House Rules Committee advanced a bill Tuesday that would permit the expedited removal of unauthorized persons from residences, though some lawmakers voiced concerns over issues of due process.
Under House Bill 96, which was approved by the Judiciary 1 Committee last week, property owners and their representatives would be allowed to request law enforcement officers to remove individuals who are unlawfully inhabiting a residence they own and refuse to leave. A tenant who is holding over after a lease term has expired would not be subject to the bill as it does not apply to properties that were offered “as an accommodation for the general public,” nor to circumstances in which payment for continued residence was demanded or paid or a contract permitting residence was agreed upon.
Upon the property owner’s request, a county magistrate would be empowered to authorize the expedited removal of the occupant and require law enforcement to evict them from the property within 24 hours as well as potentially arrest them if they have violated trespassing or other laws. The bill also provides for law enforcement to “stand by to keep the peace” while the property owner changes locks and removes the occupant’s personal belongings, shielding officers from liability for complying with the law in good faith.
The bill would also protect property owners and their representatives from liability if the occupant’s personal belongings are destroyed or damaged during the removal process unless the removal is found to be wrongful. In cases of wrongful removal, occupants can bring civil action to recover the property, costs and damages incurred, and a civil fine and attorneys’ fees. And if the occupant and the owner are engaged in litigation prior to removal, expedited removal is prohibited.
  Rep. Steve Tyson (Photo: ncleg.gov)
Rep. Steve Tyson (R-Craven), who is a realtor and general contractor, said the bill is designed to target people who unlawfully inhabit homes and apartments where there was never a valid lease. Tyson said the bill was motivated by concern that such removals can be held up in court and appeals “practically forever,” and he felt it necessary to make the process “fair for the property owner.”
“Anybody can get a lease online now and print it out,” Tyson said. “You can go somewhere online, find a copy of the deed to the property if you’re savvy and see how the owner of the property signs their name. And so, it puts law enforcement in a very precarious position.”
But Rep. Sarah Stevens (R-Surry), who is an attorney, said she has “genuine concerns” over the lack of due process for occupants under the expedited removal bill, adding that she plans to vote against the bill on the floor.
  Rep. Sarah Stevens (Photo: ncleg.gov)
“There’s a tremendous amount of violation of due process in this procedure,” Stevens said. “A magistrate has no authority to take evidence to determine if there’s any fairness or hear from the other side at all.”
She said even with the liability waiver at the state level, the bill puts law enforcement at risk for litigation over potential due process violations at the federal level.
Tyson said the penalties for filing for expedited removal under false premises act as a sufficient deterrent to property owners, even without an initial opportunity for the occupant to present their case.
“If an unscrupulous landlord — and there are a few of those out there as we know — goes in and swears this affidavit on this expedited removal and he perjures himself, it’s punishable as a class F felony,” Tyson said. “That’s up to five years in prison.”
Rep. Carla Cunningham (D-Mecklenburg), who put forth a similar proposal in the previous session, said “we need to do something” because property owners are losing out on tens of thousands of dollars because they are unable to remove people unlawfully living in residences they own.
“You get nothing and you are the one responsible for the property taxes on the property,” Cunningham said. “I don’t know if this is the right way to do it, Representative Stevens, but we’ve got to do something because people are losing money.”
While in favor of the bill creating an “express lane” for removal, Rep. Reece Pyrtle (R-Rockingham), a former police chief, raised concerns over the onus placed on law enforcement to supervise the removal of occupants’ personal belongings. He advised turning to a separate civil process for that aspect of the law. “Being a law enforcement officer, being on the scene, I don’t want to get into a he said-she said over a piece of property.”

Since this shocking and constitutionally tenuous admission, pundits and journalists from both sides of the political aisle have been abuzz with commentary.  
The short answer as to whether Trump can be elected for a third term is no. The 22nd Amendment expressly forbids a two-term president from being elected to a third term. So there. Discussion over. Challenge to long-held constitutional beliefs averted. No need to discuss this issue further. 
However, this issue is not that simple. In fact, it is rather complex.
Language matters when it comes to the Constitution. The 22nd Amendment’s use of the term “elected” precludes Trump from being elected for a third term, but it does not create ineligibility for unelected paths to the presidency. Looking at you Gerald Ford. As Trump provocatively stated “there are methods” to achieve such an outcome. 
In the classroom, New Hampshire civics teachers should take this opportunity to discuss the interactions and limitations of the 12th, 22nd, and 25th amendments. While currently untested, these constitutional ramifications should be explored by the young minds about to take hold of the reins of America’s republic. 
The 22nd Amendment
Constitutional theories about how a two-term president could return for a third term have been postulated before. This was evident in 2008 when Bill Clinton was a potential addition to a Clinton-Clinton Democratic Party ticket. Such a return to the Oval Office for any two-term president is predicated on an issue found within the interplay of the 12th and 22nd amendments.
Following the four elected terms of Franklin Delano Roosevelt, Congress moved to ratify the 22nd Amendment, setting the current constitutional limit at two presidential terms. The amendment states “[n]o person shall be elected to the office of the president more than twice…”
This language clearly forbids a president being elected to a third term via the Electoral College system. What is not clear in this language is any limit placed on the election of a vice president. The omission of election-based language for the vice president creates a constitutional scenario where a twice-elected president is eligible to seek out a term as vice president. Once in office, all that would need to happen is a presidential resignation and the vice president would assume the higher office, unelected for a third term. All along not running afoul of the 22nd Amendment. 
If Trump pursues this theory and it prevails in the federal court system, it could set a precedent allowing Democrats to do the same in the future with their preferred candidate or potentially enable Barack Obama, George Bush, or Bill Clinton to seek a third term.
The 12th Amendment
After Congress tied 35 times while trying to elect the winner of the election of 1800, it surmised a solution to avoid confusion surrounding separate electoral ballots for president and vice president. The result of which was the 12th Amendment.  
Putting aside a nuanced discussion about the changes made to the presidential ballot system, the most germane part of the 12th Amendment is its last sentence, “… no person constitutionally ineligible to the office of President shall be eligible to that of Vice-President of the United States.”
Clear as day, if an individual is ineligible for the presidency, he or she cannot become the vice president. However, it is not that clear for a few reasons. The first reason being that the 12th Amendment was written 150 years prior to the 22nd Amendment and term limits did not exist for the president. Although they were discussed at the Constitutional Convention and within Federalist 72 by none other than Alexander Hamilton, a man who was chastised as a monarchist in his day. The ineligibilities mentioned in the 12th Amendment pertain to the original qualifications of the presidency; age, citizenship, and residency. 
The original intent and text of the 12th Amendment does not include any prohibition against a president seeking a third term. Even if the word election appeared in this amendment, the omission of election-specific language in the 22nd Amendment for the vice president would create substantial vagueness and constitutional uncertainty.
Other paths to the Oval Office
There are other theorized paths and constitutional loopholes Trump could exploit to sit behind the Resolute desk for a third term. Using the language of the 25th Amendment, The Presidential Succession Act, and a few strategically placed political allies, a member of the executive Cabinet could ascend to the presidency. A feat of adept and complex political maneuvering, but given the way Trump has D.C. on its heels, not an impossible outcome.
Trump could also strong-arm a partisan Congress and state governments into passing a 28th Amendment to overturn the 22nd, allowing him to be elected to a third term. This process is highly unlikely to yield beneficial results, as it requires significant supermajorities from Congress and state governments. Trump could also just run again, without any changes to the Constitution and make the claim that he is running to represent the mandate of the people. A term he and his allies have grown fond of using during his second term.
In the New Hampshire civics classroom
Understanding the nuances of the Constitution’s amendments is vital for an informed electorate. The potential loopholes in the 12th, 22nd, and 25th amendments highlight the complexities that challenge long-held political and democratic beliefs.
By discussing these issues in New Hampshire civics classes, students will gain the critical thinking skills necessary to navigate, amend, and safeguard America’s constitutional republic. Educating young minds about these intricacies ensures they are prepared to engage in meaningful civic discourse and approach constitutional issues head on.",https://newhampshirebulletin.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/donaldtrumpthirdterm-1024x679.jpg,,,2025-04-01 12:15:41.852145

The study, conducted by Urban Institute researchers with support from the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation, calculated that up to 39% of [&#8230;]","Workers fill food orders at a restaurant in San Rafael, Calif. Republicans looking to cut federal spending on Medicaid are eyeing work requirements as one possible option (Justin Sullivan/Getty Images).Under an emerging Republican plan to require some Medicaid recipients to work, between 4.6 million and 5.2 million adults ages 19 to 55 could lose their health care coverage, according to a new analysis.
The study, conducted by Urban Institute researchers with support from the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation, calculated that up to 39% of the 13.3 million adults in that age group who became eligible for Medicaid when their states expanded the program under the Affordable Care Act would lose coverage if Congress required states to impose work rules.
The report suggests that most of those people would lose coverage not because they aren’t complying with the rules, but because they would struggle to report their compliance to the state.
“Most adults who would lose eligibility for federal Medicaid funding are working, engaged in work-related activities, or could qualify for exemptions not readily identifiable through state databases but could still face disenrollment because of the reporting requirements,” it states. The study identified several barriers to reporting, including lack of broadband access and lack of transportation.
Forty states plus the District of Columbia have expanded Medicaid under the ACA. Overall, nearly 72 million people, about a fifth of Americans, are enrolled in the program for low-income people, which is funded jointly by the federal government and the states.
Traditional Medicaid insurance was mainly available to children and their caregivers, people with disabilities and pregnant women. But the ACA, commonly known as Obamacare, allowed states to extend coverage to adults making up to 138% of the federal poverty level — about $21,000 a year for a single person.
Nationwide, more than 21 million people with low incomes have health insurance because of expanded Medicaid eligibility.
U.S. House Republicans in February pushed through a budget plan, now under consideration in the Senate, that would require about $880 billion in cuts to Medicaid over the next decade to help cover the cost of $4.5 trillion in tax cuts. The budget doesn’t contain specifics on how that target would be met. But work requirements are a likely money-saving option: A 2023 analysis from the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office found that imposing work rules on Medicaid recipients ages 19 to 55 who are not parents or caregivers would cut federal spending by an estimated $109 billion over the next 10 years.
The Congressional Budget Office based that projection on a plan the GOP-controlled U.S. House approved in 2023. That bill, the likely blueprint for the work requirements Republicans are considering now, would have required adults ages 19-55 to work, participate in a job training program or perform community service for at least 80 hours per month for three or more months in a calendar year. Parents and caretakers of dependent children, and those unable to work because of a health condition, would have been exempt.
Many Republican-led states are eager to impose work requirements on able-bodied Medicaid recipients. Thirteen states received permission to impose work rules on at least some Medicaid enrollees during the first Trump administration. Nine additional states requested permission to enact Medicaid work requirements during Trump’s earlier term but had not won approval by the time it ended.
When the Biden administration came into office, it rescinded all the approvals.
Supporters say requiring Medicaid recipients to work, study or train for a career gives them a boost toward self-sufficiency and financial stability. Critics, however, say such rules end up hurting far more people than they help.
The researchers from the Urban Institute mostly based their analysis on the experience of Arkansas, which in June 2018 became the first state to require some Medicaid recipients to work, volunteer, go to school or participate in job training to receive benefits. By the time a federal judge halted the policy in April 2019, 18,000 adults had lost coverage.
The researchers also looked at New Hampshire, which began implementing a work requirement but halted the program in July 2019 before suspending anyone’s coverage.
“What was found in a lot of qualitative research on the previous work requirement programs is that a lot of people were unaware of the policy, or they didn’t understand the policy,” said Michael Karpman, an Urban Institute researcher who co-authored the study.
“People who need coverage the most would do the most to try to maintain it. On the other hand, those people could also face the most difficulty with the administrative barriers,” Karpman said.
In a 2020 study examining how Arkansas’ last experience with work requirements played out, researchers from the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health “found no evidence that the policy succeeded in its stated goal of promoting work and instead found substantial evidence of harm to health care coverage and access.”
Arkansas Republican Gov. Sarah Huckabee Sanders announced in January that she would ask the federal government for permission to institute work requirements, regardless of what Congress decides. The state submitted the request last week.
Arkansas Republican state Rep. Aaron Pilkington, who serves on the health committee in his chamber, said lawmakers “learned our lesson from the last go-round.”
Pilkington said that under the new proposal, the state will only pause coverage instead of canceling it, giving recipients an opportunity to prove they are complying. And, he said, the online portal for reporting will be a lot more user-friendly.
“I think it’s a reasonable thing to ask for able-bodied people to look for work, or try to obtain work,” Pilkington said.
But Christin Harper, policy director for Arkansas Advocates for Children and Families, said even the new version would be a challenge for many enrollees. Many people on Medicaid are juggling multiple jobs, and having to report to the state every month would be a significant burden.
“Especially for a rural state like Arkansas, work requirements fail to take into account a lot of the realities that people may face,” Harper said. She added that “with the overall job market, job opportunities may or may not be available in some of these rural towns.”

(Vasha Hunt for Alabama Reflector)A federal judge Monday ruled that Alabama Attorney General Steve Marshall cannot prosecute people who assist individuals seeking to leave the state to obtain abortion care.
U.S. District Judge Myron H. Thompson Monday ruled in a 131-page opinion that the AG’s threatened enforcement of the state’s criminal laws to prosecute those who assist individuals seeking to leave the state for abortion care violates both the First Amendment and the right to travel.  
“At its core, this case is simply about whether a state may prevent people within its borders from going to another state, and from assisting others in going to another state, to engage in lawful conduct there,” Thompson repeated from his ruling in May denying the AG’s motion to dismiss and added, “The court now answers no, a state cannot.”

The lawsuit was filed by Yellowhammer Fund; WAWC, formerly the West Alabama Women’s Center; Alabama Women’s Center (AWC) in Huntsville and Dr. Yashica Robinson, after Marshall in 2022 publicly threatened to criminally prosecute those who assist women seeking to travel out-of-state to get an abortion under Alabama’s near-total abortion ban. Marshall’s office later defended his power to do so in a court filing in August 2023.
“An elective abortion performed in Alabama would be a criminal offense; thus, a conspiracy formed in the State to have that same act performed outside the State is illegal,” the filing stated.
Amanda Priest, a spokesperson for the Attorney General’s office, wrote in an email that “the office is reviewing the decision to determine the state’s options.”
Alabama has had an effective ban on abortion since the U.S. Supreme Court struck down federal abortion rights protections in 2022. 
Thompson ruled that the attorney general’s threats violated the plaintiffs’ clients’ right to travel. He said in the ruling that the right to travel includes the right both to move physically between states and to do what is lawful in those states, and prosecuting those who facilitate lawful out-of-state abortions would violate that right.
The court also found that the attorney general’s threatened enforcement of Alabama’s criminal laws imposes a content- and viewpoint-based restriction on speech, which violates the First Amendment.
“The attorney general has presented no other reason to deny the plaintiffs’ First Amendment claim besides his attempt to invoke the Giboney exception, which, as stated, does not extend to speech in furtherance of lawful out-of-state conduct,” Thompson wrote.
The Giboney exception would restrict speech that is directly part of or essential to committing a crime.
“Since the attorney general’s threatened enforcement cannot meet strict scrutiny, the court will enter summary judgment in favor of the plaintiffs for this freedom-of-speech claim,” Thompson concluded.
Thompson, in his conclusion, cautioned against the implications of the attorney general’s threats, writing that it is “one thing for Alabama to outlaw by statute what happens in its own backyard.  It is another thing for the state to enforce its values and laws, as chosen by the attorney general, outside its boundaries by punishing its citizens and others who help.”
“If Alabama held the power its Attorney General asserts here, it is hard to envision a limiting principle besides what the Attorney General personally sees as permissible and impermissible,” he wrote.

(Photo by Robin Opsahl/Iowa Capital Dispatch)COLFAX, Iowa – As U.S. Secretary of Agriculture Brooke Rollins toured Iowa agricultural facilities Monday, she said the U.S. Department of Agriculture is prepared to support farmers while tariffs go into place.
President Donald Trump announced plans Sunday to impose “reciprocal tariffs” on countries that have their own tariffs set on U.S. products, set to officially roll out April 2. While earlier statements from members of the Trump administration said the tariffs focus on 10 to 15 countries with large trade imbalances, the president said Sunday the tariffs will encompass all countries that charge fees for U.S. exports.
Iowans in agriculture have expressed concerns about Trump’s original plan — later delayed — to enact 25% tariffs on Mexico and Canada. Some farmers said the move could hurt Iowa, as the state’s pork and corn industries are heavily tied to the countries. A spokesperson for the White House has confirmed that the tariffs will not contain exemptions for farmers.
Speaking with reporters at Beck’s Hybrids, a retail seed company in Colfax, Iowa, Rollins tried to assuage concerns about the tariffs’ impact on agriculture. She said the Trump administration and USDA plan to aid farmers from potential economic fallout using similar strategies as in 2018, when a U.S.-China trade war during Trump’s first term led to an estimated $27 billion in U.S. agricultural export losses.
“Hopefully our farmers and our ag community won’t be hurt by — at least in the short term — by these decisions,” Rollins said. “But if they are, the president’s commitment is the same today as it was five or six years ago. And we at USDA and our partners across Congress and in Washington will work around the clock to ensure that we have the programs in place to do what we did the last time with the (Commodity Credit Corporation), and we fully expect to do the same this time, but to be determined based on what happens in the next weeks and month.”
 Farmers received $23 billion in federal assistance during Trump’s first term

The USDA provided farmers more than $23 billion in federal subsidies during Trump’s first term to help offset the economic impacts of tariffs. While Rollins said at an earlier stop in Waukee, Iowa, that “we don’t have quite the funds we had back then,” according to the Des Moines Register, she also said there was other work being done by the Trump administration to expand U.S. agriculture’s international market presence.
U.S. Rep. Mariannette Miller-Meeks, R-Iowa, who joined Rollins alongside Gov. Kim Reynolds and Iowa Agriculture Secretary Mike Naig in Colfax, said she and other Iowa officials were “very pleased” by Rollins’ commitment to go on trade missions in coming months.
“We have not seen that the past four years,” Miller-Meeks said, comparing Rollins’ approach to efforts under the Biden administration. “Six countries and six months, I think it is — because we know we need to open up more markets.”
Rollins plans to visit Vietnam, Japan, India, Peru, Brazil, and the United Kingdom in 2025.
While the agriculture secretary said tariffs are one part of Trump’s “tool kit to realign the American economy,” another component was the reduction in force happening across the federal government — including roughly 6,000 at the USDA. Rollins said she supported the effort as a way to make government more efficient and put more economic focus on “expanding the private sector, on lifting up free enterprise, on reshoring American jobs.”
“The vision isn’t that we’re putting a lot of people out of work,” Rollins said. “The vision is that we’re realigning our entire economy, where the private sector and free enterprise is driving those jobs, rather than bigger and bigger government.”

(Courtesy of SD DOC)Members of a prison work group say they’ll need to leave the past in the past if they expect to find consensus on new facilities for South Dakota’s correctional system.
There’s plenty to leave behind, they acknowledge. 
Gov. Larry Rhoden wanted lawmakers to greenlight a 1,500-bed, $825 million men’s prison in Lincoln County during this year’s legislative session. He needed support from two-thirds of them. He didn’t get it.
Governor relents, appoints task force to reset prison talks after legislative loss

That proposal’s critics — some of whom now serve on the work group — complained about a lack of transparency, as well as the price tag, facility size and the plan’s focus on a single site. 
Backers, meanwhile, argued that waiting will only cost taxpayers money. The $825 million price tag was guaranteed through Monday. 
Money questions will loom large. Lawmakers have set aside nearly $600 million for prison construction since 2023, and the state’s already spent $55 million on the Lincoln County prison plan. 
The work group has four planned meetings between now and July. The first, a two-day affair in Sioux Falls, begins Wednesday morning.
State Senate Majority Leader Jim Mehlhaff, R-Pierre, a work group member, backed the Lincoln County site during the legislative session. He said it’ll be hard to “unlearn things,” start fresh, and accept that the road may — or may not — lead back to Lincoln County.
The conversation might end, he said, with “boy, we really screwed up when we wasted all that money on that Lincoln County site.”
“If everybody’s going in there with the preconceived notion of where we’re going to wind up, it’s going to be pretty difficult to reach consensus,” Mehlhaff said. 
Three goals for work group
The Rhoden executive order that created the “Project Prison Reset” work group lists three goals: decide if the state needs a new facility, work with a consultant to figure out its size and location, and report findings to a special legislative session on July 22. 
Wednesday’s meeting starts with a morning tour of the state penitentiary in Sioux Falls, the 1881 structure the proposed Lincoln County prison was meant to largely replace. A tour of the Lincoln County site, located 14 miles south of Sioux Falls, will start at 2 p.m.

The penitentiary tour is not open to the media or the public “for security and logistical” reasons, the meeting agenda says. Lt. Gov. Tony Venhuizen, who will chair the work group, said there are too many people already to add media to the mix.
The media will be able to tour the penitentiary in the weeks between now and July 22, Venhuizen told Searchlight. 
“We’re very open to the idea of, at some point, coordinating another tour for media members,” Venhuizen said, adding that he’d need to check in with Corrections Secretary Kellie Wasko to find a suitable time.
The group’s first session will continue Thursday at 8 a.m. at the Military Heritage Alliance in Sioux Falls with a series of informational sessions on inmate job training, behavioral health, prison industries and re-entry programs. A public comment period will start at 12:30 p.m. that day.
Critics: Site could be wrong
Neighbors to the site of the now-paused prison project sued the state because it didn’t ask for the county’s permission to build there. They lost at the local level, and the state Supreme Court heard arguments on their appeal last week.
The plaintiffs are constituents of House Speaker Pro Tempore Karla Lems, R-Canton, who voted against funding the project this year. She’s also appeared at the group’s public events. She’s now one of 11 lawmakers on the 22-member work group.
The $55 million spent on that site gives Lems heartburn. Lawmakers approved $62 million for prison planning in 2024, but Lems said the executive branch spent more than it should’ve, given that the Lincoln County site lacked a final legislative blessing. 
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
Lems is encouraged that Rhoden’s office has committed to a “palms up” process for the meetings, and that the group’s been advised to “start from scratch.” 
But “the Lincoln County site is out there” and will need to be addressed.
“I don’t want to be the NIMBY person,” Lems said, using an acronym for “not in my backyard.” “But I do want to have a site that actually makes sense.”
Lems argues that some of the money spent for the site, such as the funds used to buy a stake in electrical and rural water infrastructure, won’t be completely wasted if the state can find a better plan. The rural customers will still benefit, she said.
The site “makes no sense to me at all,” she said. Rhoden called the site near Sioux Falls “a gift from God” because the state already owned the land, and because of its relative proximity to the interstate.
Backers: Find a way to yes
More than once during the 2025 session, Mehlhaff called on lawmakers to avoid “analysis paralysis” on the prison issue. The state hired a consultant, the DLR Group, to review its prison needs in 2021. A small group of lawmakers digested the findings and recommended a 1,500-bed prison the following summer, adopting the guidance of the Department of Corrections on the best path forward. 
There’s broad agreement that the state needs to do something, he said — and fast — to ease the overcrowding issues dissected throughout that report, he said. 
“I’m going to be focused on finding a solution rather than focusing on finding a problem that prevents us from finding a solution,” Mehlhaff said. “You can go down that rabbit hole, and that’s what was done before.”
Some opponents to the Lincoln County plan have zeroed in on the DLR report’s recommendations for multiple, smaller facilities across the state. Lawmakers funded a medium-security women’s prison in Rapid City nearly three years ago based on that report, and construction on that $87 million facility is ongoing.
Mehlhaff’s not convinced that smaller facilities for male inmates would make more sense than a centralized location.
“If you spread them out among four different places, you’ll have to duplicate programming, you’ll have to duplicate food service, you’ll have to duplicate prison industries,” he said, but added that he and every other member needs to be ready to hold preconceived notions in abeyance.
“We’re supposed to be taking a fresh look at it, right?”
Rehabilitation, safety questions 
Assistant Senate Minority Leader Jamie Smith, D-Sioux Falls, led an effort to rename the Department of Corrections the “Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation” during the legislative session. The pitch sailed through the Senate but failed in the House of Representatives.
Smith, now a work group member, had hoped a name change would set a tone for the department. There is programming now, but Smith said the ideal is a department that focuses as much on preparing inmates to succeed on the outside as it does on housing them.
Name change for Department of Corrections falls flat on SD House floor

Smith said he intends to honor the group’s three stated goals, but hopes issues surrounding rehabilitation and finding ways to reduce the state’s long-term need for prison beds are in the mix.
“I do believe that we need to make sure that is the focus, and ultimately what we’re trying to do,” Smith said.
House Minority Leader Erin Healy, of Sioux Falls, is the work group’s other Democrat. She’s concerned about crowding and security in the 1881 facility. She got a letter recently from a Sioux Falls inmate concerned about safety in the current building, as well as a lack of access to rehabilitation and their ability to “live a dignified life.” 
During her last tour of the penitentiary, locked-down inmates let loose similar concerns as lawmakers walked by.
“They know that if you are with Secretary Wasko, you’re probably somebody who’s making decisions for them or our state,” Healy said. “That’s kind of what I witnessed last time.”
Law enforcement: We need to work with the DOC
The current penitentiary’s condition is top of mind for Minnehaha County Sheriff Mike Milstead as he prepares for the first work group meeting. He works closely with the DOC as the elected overseer of a county jail that serves as a pretrial waystation for future penitentiary inmates or parolees nabbed and detained for violations.
Milstead has questions about the price tag and the DLR report’s alternative options, but said “the aging facility up on top of the hill is in need of replacing.”
In 1998, the sheriff had a similar problem on his hands, though “on a much smaller scale.” His jail was old, inefficient and dangerous, he said, so he went to the public to ask for support. 
The Argus Leader newspaper’s photographers and cameras from local TV stations were invited to visit. That gave Milstead a chance to make the case that a new jail, built with room to expand in the future, would be preferable to upgrades at the old one.
Parole officers create specialty unit to target parolees in hiding

“I am so glad we did not try to cobble together the old jail above the public safety building,” Milstead said.
Yankton Police Chief Jason Foote heads the South Dakota Police Chiefs’ Association. He’ll represent local law enforcement on the work group. 
He’s hoping to learn more about how the DOC’s crowded facilities and operations might play into the system’s handling of the parolees his officers deal with regularly. He wants parolees held accountable for their actions, he said, which “can be pretty severe.”
Law enforcement “has a lot of interactions with those that have been in and are now out.”
“So I think it’s important to look at the recidivism, and what the prison system can do to maybe change some of the behaviors of people,” Foote said.
Like Milstead, though, he’s coming to the group without having gone through the legislative battles on what kind of facility the DOC might need. He hopes to offer a different perspective as a result.
“I’m coming in with an open mind,” Foote said. “I’m not biased either way.”

Falling rates of vaccination, fueled by anti-vaccine conspiracy theories like those spread by newly confirmed Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., have preceded many of those outbreaks.
In a press release, the Colorado Department of Public Health and Environment said the Pueblo case was confirmed in an unvaccinated adult who had “recently traveled to an area of Mexico experiencing an ongoing measles outbreak.”

Measles is a highly contagious and often severe disease that causes symptoms including fever, cough and a characteristic rash. Cases in the U.S. plummeted following the introduction of a vaccine in the 1960s, and two doses of the combined measles, mumps and rubella, or MMR, vaccine provides about 97% protection against infection.
Colorado had the nation’s sixth-lowest rate of MMR vaccine coverage for kindergarteners in the 2023-24 school year, with an estimated only 88.3% of kindergarten students vaccinated, according to federal data. State law requires K-12 students to receive the MMR vaccine and five others, but allows for broad exemptions on medical or religious grounds.
​​“Measles is one of the most contagious diseases we know, but it is also highly preventable,” Dr. Rachel Herlihy, Colorado’s deputy chief medical officer and state epidemiologist, said in a statement. “The MMR vaccine provides excellent protection and helps prevent outbreaks like the one we are seeing globally. We urge Coloradans to review their vaccination status and take steps to protect themselves, their families, and their communities.”
Based on initial information, CDPHE officials say that Pueblo residents who visited the Southwest Deli and Cafe at 1873 S. Pueblo Blvd. between March 17 and March 21, or the Southern Colorado Clinic at 109 South Burlington Drive on the afternoon of March 22, may have been exposed to measles. People who were exposed should monitor for symptoms for at least three weeks after exposure and avoid public gatherings, especially if they are unvaccinated.

Brad Hudson, a Cape Fair Republican, listens during the first day of the 2025 legislative session — his first year as a state senator (Annelise Hanshaw/Missouri Independent).Legislation that would bar Missouri universities from penalizing student groups for their beliefs faced pointed criticism during a Monday evening House committee hearing from Democrats who say it would open the door for discrimination and hate speech.
“Some people call it ‘religious beliefs,’ and some people call it ‘discrimination,’” said state Rep. Elizabeth Fuchs, a St. Louis Democrat.
State Sen. Brad Hudson, a Republican from Cape Fair, has sponsored the bill for four years. This is the first year he has presented it as a state senator, after it cleared the Missouri Senate for the first time last month. 
Hudson worked with Democratic senators and added a provision to the bill that carves out viewpoints that “would materially and substantially disrupt the educational environment or interfere with the rights of others” from protection, avoiding a filibuster that could have doomed the legislation’s chances.
Similar proposals have been heard in the state legislature for a decade, passing both the House and a Senate committee in 2022 and 2023.
A nearly identical bill already passed the House in February on a 108-47 party-line vote.

Hudson said the bill codifies legal precedent allowing student groups to enforce religious beliefs under the protection of the First Amendment. Passing the bill, he said, would help the state avoid “needless litigation.”
Curtis Cole, campus access specialist with Chi Alpha Campus Ministries from Springfield, said his group has been threatened with removal from campuses for “holding biblically based views and standards of leadership.”
He alluded to a situation at the University of Virginia, where a student was kicked out of leadership for being in a same-sex relationship. More recently, a Chi Alpha chapter in Texas became the target of a lawsuit after a student accused a staff member of sexual assault. The staff member was a registered sex offender during his employment with Chi Alpha.
Cole said the bill was important to protect a “marketplace of ideas” on college campuses although “we’re going to disagree with each other from time to time.”
Fuchs said it went beyond disagreement and instead infringes on the rights of LGBTQ+ students.
“You want one group to be able to organize, to not be discriminated against, even if they’re organizing and discriminating against others,” she said.
Lance Kinzer, director of policy and government relations for the Washington, D.C.-based 1st Amendment Partnership, said the bill holds up to court precedents.
“It mirrors constitutional protections, and it really is just common sense,” he said.
State Rep. Wick Thomas, a Democrat from Kansas City, asked whether the bill would allow for beliefs that discriminate against other people groups.
“Wouldn’t this bill theoretically open it up for discrimination based on any sincerely held religious belief?” Thomas said. “If people believe in eugenics, they might say disabled people are not allowed to be in leadership in this organization.”
Kinzer felt judicial rulings set reasonable bounds.
“I don’t see a scenario where this would allow discrimination based upon someone being handicapped,” he said. “That is status-based and not really belief-based.”

Wisconsin’s spring election takes place Tuesday, with voters across the state weighing in on the races for state Supreme Court and superintendent of schools, a constitutional amendment and local offices.
Polls open at 7 a.m. and close at 8 p.m. Voters who are already in line to vote when polls close should remain in line and will still be able to cast their ballots. Absentee ballots must be returned by the time polls close and can be returned to a voter’s polling place or municipal clerk’s office. Information on polling places can be found at MyVote.WI.gov.
Hundreds of thousands of Wisconsinites have already cast their ballots, surpassing the early vote turnout of the 2023 Supreme Court race when 1.8 million people voted. On the Monday before the election that year, more than 409,000 ballots had already been cast. This year, more than 644,000 votes have already been cast, with Dane and Milwaukee counties each seeing the most turnout. More than 100,000 votes have already been cast in both counties.
While the lower turnout of spring elections means results usually come faster than in presidential elections, state law still doesn’t allow election officials to begin processing absentee ballots until polls open on Election Day. Last year, Republicans in the state Senate killed a bill that would have allowed absentee ballots to start being processed on the Monday before the election. This means that especially in Milwaukee, where all absentee ballots are processed and counted at one central count location, results may take longer to come in.
Supreme Court race
The race for Wisconsin Supreme Court is the most consequential on the ballot on Tuesday, with the ideological balance of the body up for grabs. Liberal-backed Dane County Judge Susan Crawford is taking on conservative-backed Waukesha County Judge Brad Schimel. The winner will replace retiring Justice Ann Walsh Bradley.
Wisconsin is holding the first statewide election in the country since President Donald Trump was elected last November. That opportunity to test the voting public’s mood, and the $20 million that Trump adviser Elon Musk has pumped into the race to support Schimel, has turned the race into a referendum on the first months of the second Trump administration.
Musk appeared at a rally in Green Bay on Sunday night to advocate for Schimel, give $1 million to two attendees and hype up his Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), which has been making drastic cuts to federal agencies and programs.
Schimel has said he is running to remove partisanship from the Court and that if elected he would  treat Trump like any other litigant in a case. But he also told a group of canvassers associated with Trump-aligned Turning Point USA that he’d be a “support network” for Trump on the Court and, the Washington Post reported, told a group of Republicans in Jefferson County that Trump was “screwed over” by the Court when it ruled against Trump’s efforts to overturn the results of  the 2020 election.
Democrats and Crawford’s campaign have accused Musk of attempting to buy a seat on the state Supreme Court. They point to Musk’s current litigation in Wisconsin challenging a state law that prevents Tesla from selling cars directly to consumers. Democrats have held People v. Musk town halls across the state where attendees said they were worried about DOGE’s cuts to Social Security, Medicaid and education.
At the only debate between the two candidates in March, Crawford called her opponent “Elon Schimel.” Crawford has said if elected she’ll be a justice who seeks to protect the rights of all Wisconsinites while Schimel has said he’s running to counter the alleged partisanship of the Court since liberals won a majority in 2023.
The race for Supreme Court has set the record for most expensive judicial campaign in U.S. history. The race recently surpassed the $100 million mark, nearly doubling the record set by Wisconsin’s 2023 Supreme Court election when more than $50 million was spent in the race between Justice Janet Protasiewicz and former Justice Dan Kelly.
While the race has been nationalized, the winner will hold a deciding vote in cases that could decide how Wisconsin’s congressional maps are drawn, how pollution is regulated, the collective bargaining rights of the state’s workers and if Wisconsin women have the right to access an abortion.
Superintendant of Schools
Also on the ballot on Tuesday is the race for superintendent of schools. The race is between incumbent Jill Underly, supported by the state Democratic party, and Brittany Kinser, an education consultant who’s been backed by the state Republican Party.
The two candidates appeared together at just one virtual forum, with Underly declining to attend a number of proposed events. Kinser has criticized Underly’s effort to change the standards used to assess student progress and advocated for more support for the state’s “school choice” programs including taxpayer-funded private school vouchers.
Underly is endorsed by the state’s teachers union and says she will defend  public schools against privatization efforts by school choice advocates such as Kinser.
Voter ID amendment
Voters will also weigh in on a proposed constitutional amendment to codify the state’s voter ID law. The Republican-authored proposal would require that voters provide a photo ID to register to vote, which is already the law. Republicans say the amendment is necessary to prevent the state  Supreme Court from striking down the voter ID requirement. Republicans have increasingly used the constitutional amendment process in recent years as a way to shape state law, avoiding Democratic Gov. Tony Evers’ veto.

(Photo by Claire Stremple/Alaska Beacon)School districts across the state are starting to issue “pink slip” notices to teachers and staff that they may be laid off, in what has become a difficult spring tradition in Alaska, as legislators debate how much the state will allocate to education funding next school year. 
The Kenai Peninsula School District is among those districts, issuing notices for 160 teachers and staff starting this week, Superintendent Clayton Holland told lawmakers on Monday. 
School district officials and advocates from around the state testified before a joint hearing of the House and Senate education committees, discussing a variety of issues and priorities of districts, including the cost of staff retention, recruitment and turnover.
“Because we’re not certain what our budget will be,” Holland said in an interview after the hearing. “And just like all districts, we can’t afford to be wrong. We can’t jeopardize our fiscal future, or the fiscal stability of our district, by overdrawing (from district savings). So right now, we’re in a holding pattern.” 
Legislators in the Senate are considering a bill passed by the Alaska House of Representatives earlier this month which would provide a $1,000 boost to per student funding. The actual amount of the increase would be higher based on factors included in the funding formula, including the size of schools and special needs. The bill is currently being heard in the Senate Education Committee. 
Holland said the district calculated the 160 staff positions that received notices based on an estimated $680 increase in per student funding, the amount included in the current budget as a one-time addition. “And so even with that $680 (increase) we’re uncertain,” he said. “We don’t know. And it’s a risk at this point.”
Holland said that while school districts grapple with budget uncertainty every year, this year is more dire because districts have less in savings, there is less interest from teachers in applying to Alaska positions, and schools face teacher shortages already. 
“I think maybe back in the old days, people would wait it out, the job was worth waiting for, and there are enough people looking for jobs. But right now that’s not the case,” Holland said. “People go elsewhere and find jobs. They’ll leave our state and look for jobs. They’ll go to places that have a retirement system, have no fiscal instability, and leave us. And then it leaves us in June, looking for people who don’t exist.”
Alaska schools began the school year with over 600 certified teacher vacancies, according to a joint position statement from the Alaska Council of School Administrators, and some Alaska schools did not have a single certified teacher on the first day of school.
The council provides professional development and advocacy for Alaska educators statewide. It urged state action to address the “dire vacancy rates” by providing competitive salaries, benefits and a defined benefit retirement option.
“Our goal is to attract and retain qualified educators, and we look at why they are leaving,” said Lori Rucksdashel, principal of Chinook Elementary School in Anchorage and president of the Alaska Association of Elementary School Principals, testifying to lawmakers. 
“What we know is nine out of 10 teachers hired each year are replacing colleagues who left voluntarily,” she said. “More than two-thirds of teachers quit before retirement.” 
She said that the challenges are greater at schools that serve lower-income communities and receive federal Title I funding, adding that their turnover rates are 50% higher than other schools, and 70% higher in math and science.
Rucksdashel cited research from the University of Alaska Anchorage Institute of Social and Economic Research that estimates the turnover cost per teacher at over $20,000, including costs for recruitment, hiring and training.    

  Researchers with the University of Alaska Anchorage Institute of Social and Economic Research estimates the turnover cost per teacher at over $20,000 (Screenshot of presentation to a joint session of the House and Senate education committees)
 

She said the lack of retirement benefits is one of the driving forces for teachers leaving. “They are leaving because of the lack of defined benefits. They are leaving because of better opportunities in the Lower 48. They are leaving because of the cost of living, and right now, they are leaving because of uncertainty of educational funding.”
Rucksdashel told lawmakers she gave notice to staff at her elementary school that same morning, including a school nurse, a story she shared with her permission. “I spoke with my nurse, who is not only a professional in her field, but a parent of three students in my school. She chose to be a school nurse because she wanted to provide for Alaska’s children as well as be with her family,” she said. “This morning, I displaced her. She is not going to wait around until we decide that we have the funding to bring her back.”
On Monday, the Anchorage School District issued an estimated 360 notices to teachers and staff, to address a $43 million shortfall. The district pledged to reverse those cuts if the Legislature passed a $1,000 per student funding increase, according to the Anchorage Daily News. 
This year, school districts around the state are grappling with budget shortfalls and school closures and consolidations, including Anchorage, Fairbanks, the Kenai Peninsula Borough, Kodiak and Ketchikan. 
Rick Dormer, principal of Ketchikan High School and president of the Alaska Association of Secondary School Principals, told lawmakers Monday that he himself is actively applying for jobs in Oregon. 
“Because if I go to Oregon, I can get a defined benefit package, I can have higher wages, I can have a lower cost of living, and I don’t have to take the time and expense to get on a Boeing jet to see my family,” he said. “It is a challenge. We want to stay. I want to stay, but we’re also highly educated professionals. We have personal goals. We have professional goals. And I can tell you that there are a lot of options out there.”
Dormer said the ACSA is working to deter turnover with mentorship, networking and leadership training opportunities for educators around the state. But he urged legislators to take action and increase per student funding. 
“That’s public schools, that’s charter schools, that’s homeschools …. Every school needs quality leadership and quality teachers, and Alaska is losing their educational leaders at a very rapid rate,” he said. “Please help our children, every child, every day, to have access to the very best education possible from effective teachers and experienced, supported principals.”
In the meantime, the Senate Education Committee is hearing the school funding bill proposed by House legislators, House Bill 69, and will consider amendments. If the committee advances the bill, it would move to the Senate Finance Committee before going to a full vote in the Senate. If passed by the Senate, it would then go before Gov. Mike Dunleavy, who could sign it, veto it or allow it to become law without his signature. Dunleavy and his legislative allies have said that any school funding increase should be accompanied by policy changes he has proposed, including expanding charter schools.

Pictured: The Lowry Ave Bridge over the Mississippi River. Photo by Getty Images. The Minnesota Legislature is in session, and it is a budget year, so state and local taxes are a big part of the deliberations. 
Many cite taxes in surrounding states, which are lower than those in Minnesota, to argue that we should lower our taxes to achieve the sort of prosperity surrounding states enjoy. 
This updates the data from a 2023 article, also published by the Minnesota Reformer. The purpose here is to demonstrate that there is evidence that higher taxes in Minnesota do buy us benefits not enjoyed by residents of surrounding states.  
Are Minnesota taxes significantly higher? 
As shown in the chart, state and local taxes in Minnesota are indeed higher than those in surrounding  states. The tax burdens include state income taxes, local and state property taxes, sales taxes, business taxes, and others like cigarette and gasoline taxes. Data for 2022 is the latest available. 

Consider a household paying the average tax rate on $80,000 of annual income. A Minnesota family  would pay about $3,000 more than a family with the same income in South Dakota. That same Minnesota family would pay about $850 more each year than a family living in Iowa or Wisconsin. 
Have Minnesota taxes always been higher than those of the other states? Prior to 2010, Wisconsinites had a higher tax burden than Minnesotans. (More on this later.) Residents of the other states have consistently faced lower tax burdens than Minnesotans. 
When compared to our previously reported 2021 data, tax burdens dropped by about 0.3% of income in all of the states except North Dakota, which rose from 7.9% to 8.8%.
Are there differences in prosperity across the five states?
Table 1 compares 2021 annual median household incomes in the five states. Middle income Minnesota households enjoy higher incomes than those in surrounding states.  
The Minnesota median household income is more than 15% higher than Iowa’s and South Dakota’s. The  median household in Wisconsin has over $10,000 less income than the median household in Minnesota. North Dakota’s median is closest to that in Minnesota, but still 10% less. 
Maybe surprisingly, all of the states bordering Minnesota have lower median income than that of the median family in the United States. Minnesota’s median exceeds the U.S. median by 9%. 
Of course, these incomes are all pretax, so Minnesota’s higher income is offset by Minnesota’s higher  tax burden. For example, our hypothetical median Iowa household would have about 15.6% less income  ($13,653) than the Minnesota household offset by tax savings of about 3.7% of that income ($3,150), for  a net difference of roughly 12% (about $10,500). 

Is Minnesota’s Prosperity a result of the higher taxes? 
First, consider the possibility that the income comparison above is simply an oddity. Table 2 shows the relationship of Minnesota median income to surrounding states’ incomes and the national median for two years prior to the pandemic. Minnesota’s median income has exceeded that in all surrounding states and the U.S. in all three reported years, and we see this consistently since 2000. While the relative numbers change from year to year, incomes in surrounding states except the Dakotas are not converging to incomes in Minnesota. 
Comparisons with North Dakota and Wisconsin deserve attention. North Dakota had very low income relative to Minnesota and its other neighbors in 1999, but not in 2012 and 2023. That relatively low income in 1999 was consistent with North Dakota in other years around 1999. The increased income after 2000 likely reflects development of the oil fields. 
In 1999, Wisconsin income was essentially the same as Minnesota’s. That was true prior to 2010. For example, in 1995, median income in Wisconsin was higher than that of Minnesota. As noted earlier, the tax burden in Wisconsin was higher than Minnesota’s until the early 2000s. As Wisconsin’s tax burden declined so did its income relative to its neighbors and the nation as whole.

At least since the early years of this century, Minnesota’s middle-income households had higher incomes than surrounding states. Minnesota is the only state with a consistently higher median income than the U.S. as a whole. So, the higher incomes in Minnesota are not an oddity; it’s been this way for awhile. 
Finally, can we relate the higher taxes to the higher income and possibly other social characteristics?  Table 3 considers some indicators of poverty, health care, education and crime that would seem to reflect relative public investments and residents’ opportunities to generate higher incomes.
Minnesota and our surrounding states all have overall and youth poverty rates lower than  the U.S. rates. Minnesota has the lowest overall rate of the five. Our youth poverty rate is less than all but North Dakota’s. The differences here are significant. If Minnesota had Wisconsin’s overall poverty rate, about 80,000 more Minnesotans would live in poverty. If Minnesota had South Dakota’s overall poverty rate, about 140,000 more Minnesotans would live in poverty. That is almost twice the population of Duluth. Unfortunately, poverty rates of the young folks exceed overall poverty rates in all states. 

Only South Dakota’s health care coverage falls well short of that of the other states in this comparison, just shy of the coverage rate of all Americans. 
Minnesotans complete high school at rates similar to surrounding states. A significantly higher proportion of Minnesotans have gone on to complete bachelor’s degrees than folks who live in the  other states. Minnesota’ higher incomes reflect past educational opportunities and achievements. The  higher incomes now improve current Minnesota students’ access to higher education. The quality of Minnesota’s K-12 education has provided another advantage: Minnesota students have the third highest college entrance exam scores in the country. 
Finally, Minnesota’s 2020 violent crime rate compares favorably to those in surrounding states and the country as a whole. South Dakota and Wisconsin are the only states with a higher violent crime rate than the U.S. as a whole. Violent crime rates in all of the states have dropped since 2021.
What conclusions can we draw? 
Minnesotans pay higher taxes than folks in surrounding states. The higher income of the Minnesota median household covers the extra taxes several times over. There is no indication that the incomes in states with lower taxes are catching up to Minnesota. Wisconsin, the only state to see a substantial income decline relative to both Minnesota and the U.S. has reduced its tax burden over the same period.  
Minnesota has lower poverty; a slightly higher proportion of its population with health coverage; better education outcomes; and lower violent crime rates. These achievements are all expensive. It is hard to conclude that our higher taxes did not make these achievements possible. 
I sought to test the ongoing claims that our taxes are higher than those around us, making us unable to compete with surrounding states. The first claim is true. The second is not. In fact, the extra taxes appear to be a net benefit to Minnesotans. 
That Minnesota compares favorably with other states and the U.S. should not lead any of us  to complacency. 
Significant segments of Minnesota rural communities and cities have low incomes, high poverty, poor educational opportunities, and endure high crime. The results here do indicate that Minnesota puts its taxes to good use and could productively invest more in improving outcomes for every Minnesotan.

(Photo: Ronda Churchill/Nevada Current)Another legislative session brings another swing at reforming Nevada’s seemingly untouchable property tax structure.
Among this year’s proposals: Letting voters in 2028 decide whether the taxable value of property should reset when a home is sold.
Currently, it does not, meaning the benefits of a depreciation factor and abatements used when calculating property tax stays with a home after it is sold to a new owner.
Assembly Joint Resolution 1, sponsored by Democratic Assemblymember Natha Anderson, proposes changing that by essentially establishing a reset button on property taxes whenever a home is sold. The resolution requires amending the state constitution, meaning it must  pass the Legislature in two consecutive sessions (this year and 2027), then go before voters for final approval in the 2028 general election.
If approved by voters, the change would result in significantly more money for local governments and school districts, who rely on property tax for funding, without changing the state’s tax rate or the beloved tax cap that limits the increase of homeowners’ tax bills to no more than 3% a year  regardless of how large the increase in property valuation.
Anderson told lawmakers on the Assembly Revenue Committee, which heard the bill Thursday, that the change is needed because the state’s property tax structure “is complex, cumbersome, not efficiently used and most importantly not meeting the needs of our local communities.”
To illustrate the inequities created by the current property tax structure, Anderson’s co-presenter, Dylan Shaver of New Day Nevada, highlighted two properties in Carson City that, as of last week, were listed for sale.
The first, a 3,500-square-foot historic mansion listed for $2.4 million, has an assessed value for property tax purposes of around $75,000. The second, a new build with just under 2,000 square feet of living space, is listed for $550,000 and an assessed value around $84,500.
For the municipalities serving both neighborhoods, this property tax structure “creates holes that cannot be resolved,” said Shaver. “We have painted ourselves in a corner that is very difficult to get out of.”
Nevada is the only state in the country that applies a depreciation formula to real estate, Anderson noted.
AJR1 would not remove the depreciation formula and would not affect any current homeowners.
“Certainly at that point of sale, the depreciation clock would restart,” said Shaver. “Realistically, that’s just how property value works under state law…”
The property tax rate for a home’s new owner would be baked into the home at the time of purchase — just as it is for purchasers of new homes.
Republican Assemblymembers Greg Hafen and Danielle Gallant said the end result is people paying more in property taxes.
Shaver, who previously worked for the City of Reno and whose current clients as a lobbyist include the City of Las Vegas and the Washoe County School District, noted that property taxes pay for municipal services like sewers, roads, police, fire and schools.
“The thing that funds all of that is property taxes,” he said, which is a problem because property tax is “linked to a ticking clock that ticks ever downward.”
Sparks Mayor Ed Lawson, a longtime critic of the state’s property tax system, said his city’s expenses have increased 54% in the last five years while revenue has gone up only 16%.
“I challenge any of you to run any kind of government or business with those kinds of numbers,” he said.
In a letter he submitted to committee, Lawson wrote that the 2005 Legislature implemented property tax caps as an emergency response to rapidly rising property values and said they intended to study the property tax statutes for a longer-term solution.
Then, the Great Recession began, devastating local government budgets. No significant changes were ever made.
Calen Evans, president of the Washoe Education Association, which also supports the resolution, called the current property tax structure “regressive and frankly absurd.”
“It shields the wealthiest property owners and starves the public services our communities rely on,” he added. “They weakened the systems meant to support us. Nowhere is that more obvious than in education.”
Other education advocates pointed to the Commission on School Funding, which has identified property tax and sales tax reform as the clearest ways to boost the state’s education funding to national average.
The resolution also saw support from groups representing municipalities and their workers, including the Nevada League of Cities & Municipalities and the Urban Consortium, which includes the cities of Las Vegas, Henderson, Reno and Sparks.
“I don’t like to pay for anything I don’t have to either,” said Todd Ingalsbee, a lobbyist for the Professional Firefighters of Nevada, “but the fact is we have to invest in ourselves, we have to invest in our communities.”
The Retail Association of Nevada is also supporting the resolution on the grounds that when local governments cannot raise the revenue they need, they often turn to raising licensing or business fees.
Those in opposition, which include Nevada Families for Freedom, the Nevada Republican Party, and Nevada Realtors, argued that people are paying enough in taxes and that the change would further strain the housing market.
 Previous attempt fizzled

Anderson’s resolution is nearly identical to 2017’s Senate Joint Resolution 14, which was sponsored by then-state Sen Julia Ratti. Ratti’s resolution passed the full Legislature in 2017 but was not reconsidered and passed again  during the 2019 session. If it had, it would have appeared on the  2020 ballot.
In 2017,the Legislature commissioned a report from Applied Analysis to analyze the expected revenue impact of Ratti’s proposal. In an exhaustive 377-page report, the researchers documented that resetting the property tax’s assessed value after a sale would result in $13.2 billion in additional revenue over a 12-year period. 
That estimate includes nearly $3.2 billion for the state’s education budget, $601 million for Clark County and $75.4 million for Washoe County.
A more recent analysis, conducted by the City of Reno in support of AJR1, estimated a reset of property tax after the sale of 4,000 parcels sold in the city in the last fiscal year would have brought in an additional $11.9 million in property tax revenue.
The City of Reno’s share of that would have been approximately $3.9 million. The State of Nevada, Washoe County, and the Washoe County School District also would have benefitted, though the city’s memo did not include what their share was estimated at.",https://nevadacurrent.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/Housing_RondaChurchill_012-aerial-vista-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-04-01 08:59:26.573863

(Jonathan Peterson for Louisiana Illuminator)Louisiana legislators might put portions of a constitutional amendment overhauling state budget and tax policies back on the ballot, even after voters overwhelmingly rejected the wide-ranging proposal in Saturday’s election. 
On Monday, Rep. Julie Emerson, R-Carencro, said she was already working on drafts of new constitutional amendments that would make some of the same budget and tax changes in the failed Amendment 2 from Saturday. 
“I think you will definitely see some of this reborn in the session,” Emerson said in an interview, later adding, “I think it is just how we package it, and how many instruments we have with it,”

The legislators’ annual lawmaking session starts April 14, and any proposed amendments to be considered need to be filed quickly. The deadline to request legislative staff to write up new amendment legislation is noon Tuesday.

“We are all scrambling to get constitutional amendments redrafted again,” Emerson said. 
Yet asking the public to reconsider portions of the budget and tax proposal might also be a gamble. Despite a heavy push from Gov. Jeff Landry and some state legislators to approve it, 65% of voters rejected Amendment 2. 
In its original form, the proposal would have made dozens of changes to Louisiana’s tax and spending policies, including capping the maximum potential state income tax rate at a lower level and placing new constraints on legislators’ ability to increase state spending. 

It would also have made it more difficult for lawmakers to enact new tax breaks while giving them more state money to spend by diverting hundreds of millions of dollars from savings accounts to the state general fund, where the dollars can be used more freely. 
Also, public school teachers and school support staff were expected to see pay stipends of $2,000 and $1,000, respectively, they’ve received for the past two years become permanent if the amendment passed. Seniors 65 and over would have seen their standard state income tax deduction double in 2026. 
Lawmakers had overwhelmingly voted to put Amendment 2, sponsored by Emerson, on the ballot for voters. Out of 144 lawmakers in the Senate and House, only 11 voted against the measure during a special legislative session devoted to tax policy last November. 

But neither Landry nor legislators embarked on campaigns to educate the public about the amendment. Efforts to get out the vote in support of the initiative until the beginning of March, about two weeks before early voting started. 
Voters balked at the length and complexity of the proposal, which had run 115 pages as a piece of legislation. Others didn’t feel comfortable voting on one amendment with so many changes that were unrelated to one another. 

“It was too much. It was complicated and it didn’t give people options,” said Sen. Franklin Foil, R-Baton Rouge, who had helped Emerson write the Amendment 2 legislation. 
Emerson said items she would like to put before the voters again include the larger income tax deduction for seniors 65 and older as well as the rerouting of revenue from state savings accounts to its general fund. Had Amendment 2 passed, the Landry administration wanted to use the money to pay for further cuts to the state income tax rate in the upcoming session. 

Lawmakers lowered income taxes for most Louisiana residents just a few months ago, when they adopted a 3% flat income tax in exchange for a higher sales tax. Landry and Republican lawmakers want to eventually eliminate the income tax altogether but need another steady source of state funding to do so. 
Foil said he would also like to look at changes that could be made to local property taxes on business inventory. 
Amendment 2 would have triggered financial incentives for parish officials to phase out or lessen their inventory taxes. Conservative lawmakers have long wanted to get rid of the tax, which costs the state government money because it partially reimburses businesses for the expense through a state tax credit. 

Changes to the inventory tax wouldn’t necessarily require a constitutional amendment and could be made through a regular statute that does not require voter approval, Foil said. 

“That’s something we are having conversations about this week, what we might still be able to address,” Foil said. 
What remains unclear is what will happen with teacher compensation. 
The strategy for making the existing teacher and school support stipends a part of their permanent pay involved draining existing state education trust funds and using the money to pay down retirement system debt. 

Even if another constitutional amendment including this strategy was proposed, it wouldn’t go before voters before lawmakers have to address teacher salaries for next year. 
That means that teachers and school staff risk seeing their pay cut for the academic year that starts July 1 unless Landry and legislators move money around to keep the extra $2,000 and $1,000 in place for them. 
Rep. Jack McFarland, R-Jonesboro, said lawmakers will have to decide whether they want to cut other programs and services to keep teachers and school support staff pay whole. The stipends cost approximately $200 million annually. 

“If [lawmakers’] priorities are the teachers’ stipends, then I’m going to have to know it,” said McFarland, who oversees the building of the budget as the House Appropriations Committee chairman. 
Emerson and other lawmakers did not say when they would put constitutional amendments on the ballot again. There are no major statewide elections scheduled for the rest of the year, and scheduling another would cost millions of dollars. 

Another round of constitutional amendments concerning budget and taxes might face less organized opposition. At least part of the pushback to Amendment 2 was fueled by concern for Amendment 3, a measure to weaken juvenile justice protections. 

Amendment 3, which failed on a 66-34 vote split, drew ire from national anti-incarceration groups, resulting in resources for an opposition campaign to Amendment 2 as well. If a similar hot-button measure isn’t on a future ballot, turnout to vote against tax and budget proposals might not be as high.

(Getty Images)Hundreds of lawful permanent residents in Nevada will lose access to critical services that help immigrants become U.S. citizens after $300,000 in federal funding was pulled from the state last week.
The U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) said the agency has cut all grants awarded through its Citizenship and Integration Grant Program in response to a March 21 agency-wide directive by U.S. Department of Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem to “restrict grant funding to sanctuary cities.”
“It’s no secret that many organizations funded by USCIS grants over the years actively undermined the rule of law and integrity of our nation’s immigration system by supporting sanctuary cities and open borders,” said a spokesperson for U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services in an email Monday.
The term “sanctuary city” often describes jurisdictions with law enforcement agencies that refuse to some degree to cooperate with ICE.  While there is no standard definition, the Center for Immigration Studies, whose research is often cited approvingly by anti-immigrant activists and politicians, does not include any Nevada jurisdictions among its inventory of “sanctuary cities.”
The Asian Community Development Council — based in Las Vegas and Reno — was notified on March 27 that the USCIS decided to permanently terminate a $300,000 grant awarded to the nonprofit in November. The funding would have provided citizenship education classes and services to more than 200 individuals during the 24-month grant period.
“These classes would have provided rigorous background on U.S. history and government, and the naturalization process. The program was designed to equip students with the essential skills and knowledge required to successfully navigate the naturalization process and obtain U.S. citizenship,” said Vida Lin, president and founder of the Asian Community Development Council in a statement.
The Asian Community Development Council was one of 43 organizations across 23 states to receive a Citizenship and Integration Grant from the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services in 2024, for a total of about $12.6 million in federal funding nationally. 
Lin said if the grant is not reinstated it will jeopardize services in Nevada that help lawful permanent residents become U.S. citizens, including application assistance, English language instruction and civics education. 
Since the Asian Community Development Council was first established in 2015, it has grown to meet several community needs. The nonprofit has supported immigrant communities in Nevada through food assistance, health insurance enrollment assistance, college readiness boot camps for local youth, and community events like the Asian Night Market, which showcases local Asian American, Native Hawaiian, and Pacific Islander -owned businesses.
However, the nonprofit has recently had to reduce its staff members “due to the uncertainty of funding at all levels,” said Lin. 
“This is the harsh reality that many nonprofits across Nevada and our country are facing currently as we try to navigate this new administration. Nevadans will continue to lose access to services and jobs due to decisions like the one DHS made last week,” Lin said. 
The Citizenship and Integration Grant Program was first established in 2009 under president Barack Obama’s administration as a way to tackle the backlog of U.S. citizenship applications and administrative burdens. 
In a letter earlier this month to the acting director of U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services, Democratic House members — including Nevada Rep. Dina Titus — said the grant funded vital services that helped reduce the naturalization backlogs in recent years.
According to the letter, the grant program has helped reduce errors and delays for lawful permanent residents seeking U.S. citizenship by equipping eligible applicants with the tools to navigate the naturalization process more effectively. 
“Cutting funding for this program will only increase administrative inefficiencies and add to existing case backlogs,” reads the letter.
However, the U.S. Department of Homeland Security Secretary characterized the grant program as a “gravy train” that could potentially support unauthorized immigration.
“Taxpayer funded programs that that (sic) support, or have the potential to support, illegal immigration through funding illegal activities or support for illegal aliens are out of step with the President and Secretary Noem’s priorities — as well as common sense. The gravy train is over,” said a spokesperson for U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services in an email Monday.",https://nevadacurrent.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/GettyImages-2165424518-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-04-01 11:08:57.512995

But, as President Donald Trump took office, one of his first actions was to freeze it, along with other Green New Deal efforts.
But, are the plans to eliminate the legislation in line with his goals to reduce energy prices? According to a study by clean energy experts, no.
The U.S. Congress passed the Inflation Reduction Act in 2022, opening doors for more federal tax credits and funding for clean energy technologies and manufacturing. Repealing the grants, tax credits and funding associated with the legislation would add about $50 to the average household’s energy bill a year by 2035 nationwide, according to a study by Energy Innovation, a clean energy and climate think tank.
SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
In Utah, annual energy bills would be $20 more expensive per household by 2030. By 2035, that number would rise to $120 per year, said Robbie Orvis, senior director for modeling and analysis at Energy Innovation.
“When you get rid of these tax credits, you get less clean energy deployed, and you get less investment in clean energy and energy technology manufacturing, like batteries and EVs and solar panels,” Orvis said. “Because wind and solar don’t have fuel costs, they’re basically free to run once you build them. And so the more wind and solar you deploy, up to a point, the more you lower energy bills, because energy bills are heavily tied to those fuel costs to run different power plants.”
Even with an expanded oil and gas production, Orvis said, energy bills are poised to rise under these federal changes. 
Additionally, while big oil companies have expressed excitement about the government’s investment in fossil fuels, they are less enthusiastic about Trump’s call to “drill, baby, drill” and increase production, since doing so could mean a decrease in prices, and their profits, according to Bloomberg. 
Coal, which has become a more expensive resource over time, may make a comeback under the Trump administration, but, according to The Washington Post, it may be temporary.



Let us know what you think...


 


While Utah will undoubtedly see an economic impact from less clean energy investment, it won’t be as much as other states that have made substantial efforts to phase out fossil fuels and would have to procure energy at higher prices without the incentives, Orvis said.  
Utah has heavily relied on resources like coal to produce electricity, passing legislation to protect the state’s coal-powered plants and vowing to keep a distance from blue states’ strategies to set ambitious clean energy targets.
A prime example are Colorado households, whose energy bills would see the biggest effect by 2030. According to the study, their prices would rise $180 annually. Other states would start seeing dramatic hikes by 2035. By then Missouri families would be the most affected, having to pay $640 more for their energy expenses per year.
With less investment in clean electricity and clean energy manufacturing, Utah would also lose 7,300 jobs by 2030 and 6,100 by 2035, carrying other consequences to the state’s economy, Orvis said.
“That means less GDP growth in Utah,” he said. “So we see a decrease in state GDP of $1.34 billion in 2030, and $1.29 billion in 2035.”
While Republican leaders, including Trump, have big hopes for the fossil fuel industry, citing affordability and reliability, a focus on drilling wouldn’t necessarily compensate for the job losses tied to stalling clean energy projects, Orvis said.
“You just don’t need that many hours to extract fossil fuels. Oil and gas companies have become very efficient at doing it, and so even with some increase in fossil fuel production, you still have enormous job losses,” he said.

Sen. Greg Albritton, R-Atmore, said in an interview last week that even with the 2025 legislative session over halfway through, there is still time for lawmakers to approve a gambling package, but he just needs “a few more assurances.”
“I’ve got folks, two or three across the state, that need to be on board with this, but as far as number of votes, I think all we need is one, maybe two at the most,” Albritton said.

If introduced, Albritton said, the bill would be a “trimmed down” version of the legislation package approved last year, including a lottery, sports betting and regulation and 24% tax at Class II gaming, or electronic bingo, at six existing facilities. There would be no additional facilities that could open under the legislation.
Albritton also said he expects the draft legislation to bring in between $700-750 million in revenue.
“You won’t see anything that you haven’t already seen. This is a cut-and-paste job,” Albritton said.
If the legislation is introduced, it would throw one of the most divisive issues in Alabama politics into the waning days of the 2025 session. 
Alabama’s 1901 Constitution bans lotteries and gambling. Gambling that is legally present in the state is conducted in facilities authorized by local constitutional amendments or on land held in trust by the federal government for the Poarch Band of Creek Indians, a federally-recognized Indian tribe that operates casinos in Atmore, Montgomery and Wetumpka. The state is the last east of Mississippi without a lottery. 
Attempts to create a lottery or expand existing gaming have been derailed by fighting between different gambling interests; battles between the House and Senate over how gambling proceeds should be spent and deep divisions within the GOP caucus, which holds majorities in both chambers, over the issue. 
The Alabama House in 2024 approved a constitutional amendment and legislation to legalize a state lottery and gambling. The measure stalled in the Senate.
In the Senate, 20 senators voted for the constitutional amendment, one vote short of the three-fifths majority required for constitutional amendments. Albritton, who carried the package in the Senate, did not vote for it, citing concerns he was unable to address about the bills’ intent to regulate, not condone, gambling.  
Sen. Jack Williams, R-Wilmer, who voted in favor of gambling legislation in 2021 but voted against the 2024 measures said in a phone interview that he still has not seen any gambling legislation and does not know how he’ll vote on it. He declined to answer whether he would support legislation similar to the 2024 bills.
“I just don’t know where I am at on this bill,” he said.
Alabama House members last year sharply criticized the Senate’s handling of the package, and House leadership has said the chamber will not take up its own bill this year. Rep. Chris Blackshear, R-Smiths Station, one of the driving forces behind last year’s attempt to legalize gambling, said in an interview that any legislation would have to start in the Senate.
“If the Senate is able to pass a comprehensive gaming packaging this session, the House stands ready to receive it, review it, and develop a gameplay and move it forward,” Blackshear said.
A comprehensive package, Blackshear said, should address and increase fines for illegal gaming activity across the state, as well as the structure to enforce those new regulations.
Rep. Sam Jones, D-Mobile, who also worked on last year’s package, said he’s interested in learning more about how the revenue will be distributed, a point of contention between the House and Senate last year.
“Is all the revenue going to be dedicated to education? If not, then what happens to the rest of the revenue and how is it distributed for the other needs in the state?” Jones asked.

Tsigdinos)A sobering Lake Tahoe investigative journalism series by CalMatters arrived at an inopportune time for the Tahoe Regional Planning Agency (TRPA).  The deep dive into how public monies are used at Lake Tahoe landed as the agency comes before Nevada and California legislatures seeking millions of dollars for its operating budget. TRPA will be in Carson City on April 2.
As explained in an NPR CapRadio interview, a team of reporters spent months requesting and analyzing documents from the agency and submitting public records requests to federal, state and county sources. What came to light is that the Tahoe agency and a “myriad” of funders from both states and the five counties in the Tahoe basin along with deep-pocketed private interests (which include resort executives and developers on non-profit boards) have established a closed loop system for advancing pet projects. Items include: a consultant-generated rebranding of tourism as ‘sustainable’; photo opp summits; trail construction into once pristine shorelines and forests; and, despite a court order to cease and desist: poisoning water in the Tahoe Keys to ease boat access.
As one of the investigative journalists noted (audio time stamp 25.58) “they’re all giving money to each other through grants or what have you – it’s this very complex interwoven web that’s hard to dissect for sure.”  
That’s not to say TRPA doesn’t have annual independent financial audits of its operations. It does. The last occurred for the financial year ending June 2024. The CalMatters analysis goes beyond the agency’s day-to-day operations.
TRPA has been at the nexus of billions of dollars over decades. It reported: “About $581 million — slightly more than a third of the government and private money spent in the Tahoe region since 2010 — has funded recreation, transit, paved path and trail projects. Included is $40 million for a new sports and aquatics center. Those types of expenses are growing in recent years: Since 2015, they now amount to 43% of the funding, twice the share of the previous five years.”
Who are among the beneficiaries of new recreation attractions? Multinational resort operators like Vail Resorts; it offered up a vice president to join TRPA on a recent lobbying trip to Washington D.C. along with the head of the previously named North Lake Tahoe Resort Association and other Tahoe tourism representatives.
Nevada Current also found a bias to recreational spending when it investigated where dollars in TRPA’s Environmental Improvement Program were flowing. That reporting occurred as a bill introduced by Nevada Republican Rep. Mark Amodei and co-sponsored by Nevada Democratic Senator Catherine Cortez Masto made its way through Congress. Millions more became available to TRPA in September 2024 when the bill became law.
  Screenshot promoting TRPA’s Development Rights Marketplace
Spend any time on TRPA’s website and you’ll find all sorts of developer goodies including a development rights marketplace with developer incentives. In its development pipeline are new amenities for an older ski resort now owned by a commercial real estate development and investment firm.
The agency is also a founding partner of a cleverly devised tourism initiative designed to funnel money to private interests under the auspices of environmental improvement.
Government agencies with such scope, authority and funds at their disposal would typically answer to a full-time, comprehensive Office of Inspector General or comparable independent dedicated oversight division. This ensures agencies are in routine compliance and do not engage in ineffective, unethical or unlawful operations. Full-time oversight doesn’t exist for TRPA. However, it does have more “public-private” partnerships than you can count on two hands and highly paid executives who excel at PowerPoint presentations.
How’s Lake Tahoe doing?
While the agency works to combat aggressive aquatic invasive species entering Lake Tahoe, this effort becomes more difficult with new piers offered every two years.
The Tahoe Science Advisory Council peer review of the latest TRPA Environmental Threshold Evaluation called out deficiencies in data and lack of accounting for increasing wildfire activity with, among other things, “no mention of increasing wildfires on nitrogen emissions concentrations” (excess nitrogen in lakes is a major source of pollution), and inconsistencies in evaluation methods and metrics.
The academics put it this way: “The disconnect between some standards and management activities reinforces the need (identified by previous threshold evaluation reviews) to revisit the threshold standard system for air quality, noise, recreation, vegetation preservation, and water quality. Revisiting the threshold standards and the associated data sources is needed to ensure TRPA’s monitoring programs can best inform implementation actions and monitor the impacts of those investments.”
Meanwhile, the Tahoe Area Group Sierra Club noted Lake Tahoe has gained “international acclaim for its high microplastic levels, nearshore water quality severely impaired with algae and cyanobacteria blooms, toxic materials in the lake’s waters surpassing the EPA-approved limit by more than 2,500 times in the lake, and a trash problem that is now infamous around the world.”
TRPA has been briefed on microplastics but has initiated no action.
Compliance is not TRPA’s strong suit. The Tahoe Event Center in Douglas County opened in 2023 without onsite parking, meant to reduce vehicle miles traveled (VMT). Traffic count is one factor in determining VMTs, yet TRPA never followed up to see if the required vehicle counting monitors were installed (they weren’t).
And Tahoe infrastructure? According to the Tahoe City Public Utility District, much of Tahoe’s water infrastructure was built in the 1960s and the aging pipes “don’t meet today’s fire codes.” Yet that hasn’t stopped TRPA from amending ordinances to allow for higher density development. Developers are already marketing their Tahoe luxury properties.
Under the rubric of housing, TRPA rushed to loosen development standards for taller buildings, removed land coverage restrictions meant to filter and recharge rain and snowmelt that flow to the lake, and greenlit accessory dwelling units (ADUs). Tahoe county planners, in a moment of candor, allowed they expect ADUs will be turned into tourist accommodation units.
Gotta keep the tourists happy. But impacts to the Lake?
  Screenshot from TRPA’s Land Coverage 101
“With all the new projected development, all of the science in the world won’t save Lake Tahoe.” That was one of many serious public comments offered by a member of the Tahoe Environmental Research Council advisory board in the most recent TRPA governing board meeting.
There’s only 0ne Lake Tahoe
Lake Tahoe needs a truly science-based environmental enforcement and compliance agency. The Tahoe basin also needs a realistic update of the Tahoe basin’s carrying capacity. It’s time to amend TRPA codes to include specific modern-day thresholds such as wildfire evacuation, tourism/human capacity and traffic. Shouldn’t there be an accurate determination of how much more development and human impact Tahoe can safely accommodate?
Asking the same agency to both approve and police large new developments makes no sense. It cannot be both ‘judge and jury’ and expect that the public and environment’s interests will be best served.
What was the response to the investigative reporting on how far TRPA had strayed from its watchdog focus? TRPA doubled down on how much it values development and tourism. One public servant, TRPA’s governing board member and Washoe County Commissioner Alexis Hill, dismissed the report outright as “misinformation” and diminished the award-winning media outlet as “quote unquote journalism.”
Despite TRPA and its partners’ spin, the public doggedly continue to express valid concerns to TRPA’s governing board and Nevada’s legislators.

The National Weather Service is reducing the number of weather balloons it launches across the country, an early tangible decrease in services offered in the wake of cuts by the Trump administration.
The NWS, part of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, announced last week that it was halting or reducing weather balloon operations at 11 locations, citing staffing shortages.
The NWS uses these weather balloons, until recently launched twice per day from 100 total locations, to gather temperature, wind, pressure and other data from the ground up to approximately 100,000 feet. The results are compiled along with data from satellites, radar stations, surface weather stations, buoys and aircraft to build weather models and forecasts that are public and freely available.

Any weather forecast made available via broadcast news, a commercial app or other media is almost certainly derived from data and model computations made by the National Weather Service using weather balloons.
Michael Morgan, former assistant secretary of commerce for environmental observation and prediction at NOAA and now a professor of atmospheric sciences at the University of Wisconsin-Madison, said data from weather balloons is one of the fundamental inputs to climate and weather forecasting models.
“We’re going to lose data because of this staffing,” Morgan said in a press conference Monday.  “And that loss of data then translates into less precise forecasts, more uncertainties in the forecast.
“Does it mean every single forecast is going to be poor? No, but it does mean that the uncertainties in our forecast will grow over time.”
Alan Sealls, longtime television meteorologist and president-elect of the American Meteorological Society, said that time will tell how much the loss of several balloon launch sites will impact the accuracy of those forecast models.
“It’s similar to constructing a steel-framed office building requiring a certain number of bolts,” Sealls said in an email. “Nobody can say how many bolts you can leave out or remove before the structural integrity is compromised.”
The National Weather Service did not respond to requests for comment on the balloon launches and how it would impact forecasting.
The agency’s announcement of the cutbacks said that radiosondes, the equipment on weather balloons, “are one of many technologies that collect earth observation data for weather modeling and forecasting. Data is also collected from instruments aboard commercial aircraft, surface observing stations, satellites, radars, and buoys.”
NOAA also said that the impacted offices would still perform “special observations as needed.”

DOGE cuts hamper models

The balloon launches were cut after NOAA announced hundreds of layoffs or voluntary resignations across the agency, including at the National Weather Service, as the agency fell into the crosshairs of President Donald Trump’s Department of Government Efficiency, headed by Elon Musk.
The cuts were announced in waves since staffing reductions took effect. Former NOAA Administrator Rick Spinrad said in a press conference last week that about 650 NOAA employees were reportedly among those fired, and his former colleagues in the agency said that they had been ordered to “identify another 1,029 positions” for termination.
The NOAA firings have been challenged in court, and on March 13 a U.S. District Court in Maryland issued a temporary restraining order instructing that impacted workers be reinstated. Those workers have since been put on administrative leave and have not returned to work, according to court filings.
Morgan said that because the orders targeted probationary workers—people who had been in their current role for less than two years—NOAA was losing many of its most promising young employees.
“Some of these probationary employees were actually new, early-career folks that have been bringing in a skill set that, frankly, I don’t have, and a lot of folks who have been at the Weather Service for a while don’t have,” Morgan said. “These are folks that know about Python, know about machine learning and data science, that were going to help move the Weather Service into this next generation of modeling and model development.”
NOAA said it has suspended all radiosonde launches until further notice at three stations: Kotzebue, Alaska; Omaha, Nebraska; and Rapid City, South Dakota.
NOAA also announced it was reducing launches to once per day at an additional six locations: Aberdeen, South Dakota; Grand Junction, Colorado; Green Bay, Wisconsin; Gaylord, Michigan; North Platte, Nebraska; and Riverton, Wyoming.
Launches from two other stations—Albany, New York, and Gray, Maine—have been temporarily suspended, but NOAA said the launches would resume twice per day “when staffing permits.”
In addition to impacts for immediate forecasting, Sealls said the loss of data history could create gaps for future researchers and model developers.
Despite the reductions, NOAA’s Climate Prediction Center issued its spring weather outlook last week, which included critical drought warnings for the Colorado River, the Rio Grande and large portions of the southwestern United States.

How it works

The balloons are filled with helium to be roughly five feet in diameter and released at the same time from all participating weather stations, in what the Weather Service calls its Upper Air Observation network.
Once launched, each balloon carries a radiosonde, a device that collects data on temperature, dew point, relative humidity, barometric pressure, wind speed and wind direction.
The radiosonde transmits that data in one-second intervals as it rises through the atmosphere. A typical balloon flight lasts around two hours, and can reach altitudes over 100,000 feet and can drift more than 100 miles from the launch site, according to the Weather Service.
The balloon eventually bursts, and the radiosonde falls back to the ground with a parachute.
The NWS website says that despite the variety of other methods of collecting data, “the weather balloon remains the best platform for observing temperature, wind, relative humidity, and pressure above the ground.”
James Spann, a prominent television meteorologist in central Alabama, said those balloon flights are a crucial part of delivering local forecasts.
“That’s the input for the computer models,” Spann said. “And if you don’t have data at the input of these models, you get no output. So the upper air observation network is critical.”
According to the posted notices, NWS offices “will perform special observations as needed.”
Sealls said those special observations will be critical in severe weather events.
“Missing weather balloon data will become a big concern in threats of hurricanes, winter storms, ice storms, tornadoes and other severe weather because weather balloons offer detail above the ground that other instruments cannot match,” he said.

Leaders at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ordered staff last week not to release their experts’ assessment that found the risk of catching measles is high in areas near outbreaks where vaccination rates are lagging, according to internal records reviewed by ProPublica.
In an aborted plan to roll out the news, the agency would have emphasized the importance of vaccinating people against the highly contagious and potentially deadly disease that has spread to 19 states, the records show.
A CDC spokesperson told ProPublica in a written statement that the agency decided against releasing the assessment “because it does not say anything that the public doesn’t already know.” She added that the CDC continues to recommend vaccines as “the best way to protect against measles.”

But what the nation’s top public health agency said next shows a shift in its long-standing messaging about vaccines, a sign that it may be falling in line under Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., a longtime critic of vaccines:
“The decision to vaccinate is a personal one,” the statement said, echoing a line from a column Kennedy wrote for the Fox News website. “People should consult with their healthcare provider to understand their options to get a vaccine and should be informed about the potential risks and benefits associated with vaccines.”
ProPublica shared the new CDC statement about personal choice and risk with Jennifer Nuzzo, director of the Pandemic Center at Brown University School of Public Health. To her, the shift in messaging, and the squelching of this routine announcement, is alarming.
“I’m a bit stunned by that language,” Nuzzo said. “No vaccine is without risk, but that makes it sound like it’s a very active coin toss of a decision. We’ve already had more cases of measles in 2025 than we had in 2024, and it’s spread to multiple states. It is not a coin toss at this point.”
Alabama health officials investigate possible measles exposure

For many years, the CDC hasn’t minced words on vaccines. It promoted them with confidence. One campaign was called “Get My Flu Shot.” The agency’s website told medical providers they play a critical role in helping parents choose vaccines for their children: “Instead of saying ‘What do you want to do about shots?,’ say ‘Your child needs three shots today.’”
Nuzzo wishes the CDC’s forecasters would put out more details of their data and evidence on the spread of measles, not less. “The growing scale and severity of this measles outbreak and the urgent need for more data to guide the response underscores why we need a fully staffed and functional CDC and more resources for state and local health departments,” she said.
Kennedy’s agency oversees the CDC and on Thursday announced it was poised to eliminate 2,400 jobs there.
When asked what role, if any, Kennedy played in the decision to not release the risk assessment, HHS’ communications director said the aborted announcement “was part of an ongoing process to improve communication processes — nothing more, nothing less.” The CDC, he reiterated, continues to recommend vaccination “as the best way to protect against measles.”
“Secretary Kennedy believes that the decision to vaccinate is a personal one and that people should consult with their healthcare provider to understand their options to get a vaccine,” Andrew G. Nixon said. “It is important that the American people have radical transparency and be informed to make personal healthcare decisions.”
Responding to questions about criticism of the decision among some CDC staff, Nixon wrote, “Some individuals at the CDC seem more interested in protecting their own status or agenda rather than aligning with this Administration and the true mission of public health.”
The CDC’s risk assessment was carried out by its Center for Forecasting and Outbreak Analytics, which relied, in part, on new disease data from the outbreak in Texas. The CDC created the center to address a major shortcoming laid bare during the COVID-19 pandemic. It functions like a National Weather Service for infectious diseases, harnessing data and expertise to predict the course of outbreaks like a meteorologist warns of storms.
Other risk assessments by the center have been posted by the CDC even though their conclusions might seem obvious.
In late February, for example, forecasters analyzing the spread of H5N1 bird flu said people who come “in contact with potentially infected animals or contaminated surfaces or fluids” faced a moderate to high risk of contracting the disease. The risk to the general U.S. population, they said, was low.
In the case of the measles assessment, modelers at the center determined the risk of the disease for the general public in the U.S. is low, but they found the risk is high in communities with low vaccination rates that are near outbreaks or share close social ties to those areas with outbreaks. The CDC had moderate confidence in the assessment, according to an internal Q&A that explained the findings. The agency, it said, lacks detailed data about the onset of the illness for all patients in West Texas and is still learning about the vaccination rates in affected communities as well as travel and social contact among those infected. (The H5N1 assessment was also made with moderate confidence.)
The internal plan to roll out the news of the forecast called for the expert physician who’s leading the CDC’s response to measles to be the chief spokesperson answering questions. “It is important to note that at local levels, vaccine coverage rates may vary considerably, and pockets of unvaccinated people can exist even in areas with high vaccination coverage overall,” the plan said. “The best way to protect against measles is to get the measles, mumps, and rubella (MMR) vaccine.”
Last week, though, as the number of confirmed cases rose to 483, more than 30 agency staff were told in an email that after a discussion in the CDC director’s office, “leadership does not want to pursue putting this on the website.”
The cancellation was “not normal at all,” said a CDC staff member who spoke anonymously for fear of reprisal with layoffs looming. “I’ve never seen a rollout plan that was canceled at that far along in the process.”
Anxiety among CDC staff has been building over whether the agency will bend its public health messages to match those of Kennedy, a lawyer who founded an anti-vaccine group and referred clients to a law firm suing a vaccine manufacturer.
During Kennedy’s first week on the job, HHS halted the CDC campaign that encouraged people to get flu shots during a ferocious flu season. On the night that the Trump administration began firing probationary employees across the federal government, some key CDC flu webpages were taken down. Remnants of some of the campaign webpages were restored after NPR reported this.
But some at the agency felt like the new leadership had sent a message loud and clear: When next to nobody was paying attention, long-standing public health messages could be silenced.
On the day in February that the world learned that an unvaccinated child had died of measles in Texas, the first such death in the U.S. since 2015, the HHS secretary downplayed the seriousness of the outbreak. “We have measles outbreaks every year,” he said at a cabinet meeting with President Donald Trump.
In an interview on Fox News this month, Kennedy championed doctors in Texas who he said were treating measles with a steroid, an antibiotic and cod liver oil, a supplement that is high in vitamin A. “They’re seeing what they describe as almost miraculous and instantaneous recovery from that,” Kennedy said.
As parents near the outbreak in Texas stocked up on vitamin A supplements, doctors there raced to assure parents that only vaccination, not the vitamin, can prevent measles.
Still, the CDC added an entry on Vitamin A to its measles website for clinicians.
On Wednesday, CNN reported that several hospitalized children in Lubbock, Texas, had abnormal liver function, a likely sign of toxicity from too much vitamin A.
Texas health officials also said that the Trump administration’s decision to rescind $11 billion in pandemic-related grants across the country will hinder their ability to respond to the growing outbreak, according to The Texas Tribune.
Measles is among the most contagious diseases and can be dangerous. About 20% of unvaccinated people who get measles wind up in the hospital. And nearly 1 to 3 of every 1,000 children with measles will die from respiratory and neurologic complications. The virus can linger in the air for two hours after an infected person has left an area, and patients can spread measles before they even know they have it.
This week Amtrak said it was notifying customers that they may have been exposed to the disease this month when a passenger with measles rode one of its trains from New York City to Washington, D.C.

(Photo by Robin Opsahl/Iowa Capital Dispatch)As U.S. Secretary of Agriculture Brooke Rollins toured Iowa agricultural facilities Monday, she said the U.S. Department of Agriculture is prepared to support farmers while tariffs go into place.
President Donald Trump announced plans Sunday to impose “reciprocal tariffs” on countries that have their own tariffs set on U.S. products, set to officially roll out April 2. While earlier statements from members of the Trump administration said the tariffs focus on 10 to 15 countries with large trade imbalances, the president said Sunday the tariffs will encompass all countries that charge fees for U.S. exports.
Iowans in agriculture have expressed concerns about Trump’s original plan — later delayed — to enact 25% tariffs on Mexico and Canada. Some farmers said the move could hurt Iowa, as the state’s pork and corn industries are heavily tied to the countries. A spokesperson for the White House has confirmed that the tariffs will not contain exemptions for farmers.

Speaking with reporters at Beck’s Hybrids, a retail seed company in Colfax, Rollins tried to assuage concerns about the tariffs’ impact on agriculture. She said the Trump administration and USDA plan to aid farmers from potential economic fallout using similar strategies as in 2018, when a U.S.-China trade war during Trump’s first term led to an estimated $27 billion in U.S. agricultural export losses.
“Hopefully our farmers and our ag community won’t be hurt by — at least in the short term — by these decisions,” Rollins said. “But if they are, the president’s commitment is the same today as it was five or six years ago. And we at USDA and our partners across Congress and in Washington will work around the clock to ensure that we have the programs in place to do what we did the last time with the (Commodity Credit Corporation), and we fully expect to do the same this time, but to be determined based on what happens in the next weeks and month.”
The USDA provided farmers more than $23 billion in federal subsidies during Trump’s first term to help offset the economic impacts of tariffs. While Rollins said at an earlier stop in Waukee that “we don’t have quite the funds we had back then,” according to the Des Moines Register, she also said there was other work being done by the Trump administration to expand U.S. agriculture’s international market presence.
U.S. Rep. Mariannette Miller-Meeks, R-Iowa, who joined Rollins alongside Gov. Kim Reynolds and Iowa Agriculture Secretary Mike Naig in Colfax, said she and other Iowa officials were “very pleased” by Rollins’ commitment to go on trade missions in coming months.
“We have not seen that the past four years,” Miller-Meeks said, comparing Rollins’ approach to efforts under the Biden administration. “Six countries and six months, I think it is — because we know we need to open up more markets.”
Rollins plans to visit Vietnam, Japan, India, Peru, Brazil, and the United Kingdom in 2025.
While the agriculture secretary said tariffs are one part of Trump’s “tool kit to realign the American economy,” another component was the reduction in force happening across the federal government — including roughly 6,000 at the USDA. Rollins said she supported the effort as a way to make government more efficient and put more economic focus on “expanding the private sector, on lifting up free enterprise, on reshoring American jobs.”
“The vision isn’t that we’re putting a lot of people out of work,” Rollins said. “The vision is that we’re realigning our entire economy, where the private sector and free enterprise is driving those jobs, rather than bigger and bigger government.”

Santiago/Getty Images)Democratic lawmakers have revamped their approach to banning flavored tobacco products in Washington.
In new bills filed Friday in the state House and Senate, the original prohibition on flavored vapes proposed early in the legislative session is combined with an increase in cigarette taxes. The measure’s sponsor in the House, Rep. Kristine Reeves, D-Federal Way, said she hopes it becomes part of the smorgasbord of revenue measures Democrats are eyeing to fill the looming budget deficit.
The new legislation, House Bill 2068, revives the ambitious and controversial prohibition that had made little progress in Olympia so far this year. Supporters hope it can curb youth smoking, as studies show middle and high school students overwhelmingly favor flavored options.
Andrew Estep, the campaign manager for Flavors Hook Kids Washington, calls the new plan a “holistic approach to bettering the health of Washington residents.”
Critics of such bans have argued they would lead to increased cigarette use as consumers look for alternatives. And people who’ve turned to electronic cigarettes to quit smoking traditional cigarettes would no longer have flavored options. 
The ban on selling flavored e-cigarettes, also called vapes, and nicotine products, like menthol cigarettes, would begin July 1, 2027. The sale of nicotine pouches, like Zyn, to patrons under age 21 would also be prohibited.
The initial proposal, House Bill 1203, would have banned the products beginning 90 days after the legislative session ends. This new approach allows the state to continue earning sales tax revenue from the products amid a budget deficit as high as $16 billion over the next four years.
Flavored shisha, or hookah, tobacco would be exempt from the prohibition.
The bill also adds a $2-per-pack tax on cigarettes. That tax would rise with inflation. The first $5 million from the new tax would go toward preventing youth tobacco and vape use. The rest would go into the state’s general fund. 
It also adjusts how vapor taxes are collected, adjusting the rate so it’s based on the product’s price instead of the volume of liquid. Advocates say this will increase revenue, with money going to the Andy Hill Cancer Research Endowment Fund, foundational public health services and the general fund.
Reeves said Friday that if the Legislature is going to further tax these products, it should go toward funding “the social outcomes we want.”
The tax provisions would take effect Jan. 1, 2026. The goal is to offset the lost sales tax revenue from the banned products. 
Washington smokers already face one of the nation’s highest state cigarette taxes, totaling $3.77 between excise and sales taxes, according to the Campaign for Tobacco-Free Kids.
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
A separate cigarette tax proposal, also sponsored by Reeves, would increase the existing $3.03 excise tax on a 20-pack of cigarettes by 30 cents. For vape liquid, the tax on containers of 5 milliliters or more would go up a penny to 10 cents per milliliter, and the fee on other vapor products would rise three cents to 30 cents per milliliter.
The new legislation under consideration would also up the license fee for cigarette and vapor product distributors and retailers.
Businesses licensed to sell these products would be required to post signage noting the statewide ban. And the state Department of Health would run a campaign to build awareness about the harms of flavored tobacco products.
About half a dozen other states restrict flavored tobacco sales to varying degrees.
Since the proposal would bring in new tax revenue, it is considered “necessary to implement the budget” and so is immune from deadlines that have already killed numerous bills this session.
Sen. Noel Frame, the leading Democratic voice on new revenue this year, said the bill is intriguing not just because it generates money for the state but because “it’s good public policy.”
Reeves expects the bill to get a hearing from the House Finance Committee in the next couple weeks. If it doesn’t make it to the finish line this session, she sees the legislation as laying the groundwork for progress in 2026.",https://washingtonstatestandard.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/vapes-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-04-01 08:03:28.442341

J.D. Prescott, R-Union City, speaks on the House floor on Jan. 30, 2024. (From Prescott's official Flickr page)Legislation adding political party affiliations to Indiana’s currently nonpartisan school board elections got one step closer to law Monday, when it narrowly earned House approval. The 54-40 tally included “no” votes from 14 Republicans and all 26 Democrats present.
Supporters maintained the locally chosen boards are already partisan.
“Just in the last few years, we’ve had issues that’ve been brought to the forefront … One party is saying it’s okay that biological males can compete with our daughters … in sports; another party is pushing against that,” began Rep. Jim Lucas, R-Seymour. “One party thinks it’s okay to sterilize and mutilate children; another party is pushing against that. One party thinks it’s okay that we have pornography —”

Infuriated Democrats alleged a violation of the chamber’s rules, prompting a command from House Speaker Pro Tempore Mike Karickhoff for Lucas to “speak to the bill.”
“I think it’s important that we know who is running for our school boards (and) making decisions for our children that have been extremely controversial,” Lucas finished. “… This is an easy vote.”
Rep. Cherrish Pryor, D-Indianapolis, said Lucas’ remarks showed lawmakers are “injecting” politics into school board races “at a level that is truly beneath us.”
She also recalled that many supporters in committee were unsuccessful school board candidates who had lost in recent elections.
Pryor and other opponents — despite the vote, only Democrats spoke on Monday — asserted the changes would create or exacerbate the partisan divide.
“The whole premise of this bill is, ‘Ah, there’s politics in the schools. Let’s just put more politics in … and make everybody be a politician that runs for the school board,” said Rep. Chuck Moseley, D-Portage. “Well, I spent nine years on the school board, and … we kept politics out of that.”
Transparency and turnout
Sponsor Rep. J.D. Prescott, R-Union City, said Senate Bill 287 would “provide transparency” to voters and drive up Indiana’s infamously low turnout.
But Rep. Kyle Miller, D-Fort Wayne, asserted that it’d instead create “lazy voters and lazy candidates” who rely on partisan designations to do the work — of researching candidates and campaigning to community members — for them.

All 54 yes votes came from Republicans.
The 14 Republicans who joined 26 Democrats in opposition were: Reps. Ed Clere, Matt Commons, Mark Genda, Dave Hall, Dave Heine, Chris Judy, Matt Lehman, Ethan Manning, Chris May, Wendy McNamara, Julie Olthoff, Jim Pressel, Hal Slager and Greg Steuerwald.

Prescott later called the affiliations “just the starting point, not the ending point,” adding, “When you’re looking at Republican or Democrat on the ballot, you still have to go through and evaluate the candidates themselves for who they are.”
Rep. Kyle Pierce, R-Anderson, said Prescott “has done a great job to find a middle ground.”
The legislation requires nominating petitions to state the candidate’s political party affiliation, the candidate is independent of a party, or that the candidate choses to be listed as nonpartisan.
Partisan hopefuls would have letters next to their names on general election ballots, while independent and nonpartisan candidates would get blank spaces. Straight-ticket voting — in which voters can choose a party’s entire slate of candidates with a single ballot mark — wouldn’t include school board elections. Hoosiers would still make each pick.
Forty-one states provide for nonpartisan school board elections, according to Ballotpedia. Five allow for either, depending on the district, and four do partisan elections. Indiana could soon join the latter group.
But Senate Bill 287 isn’t heading to Gov. Mike Braun’s desk just yet.
That’s because a House committee this month stripped the measure of its original language requiring school board candidates to run in primary elections like other candidates. Members replaced it with the general election designation, pulled from the long-dead House Bill 1230.
The Senate must concur with the House’s changes — or, the two chambers must agree on a compromise — before it exits the legislative process.

The proposal retains other partisan features, however. Candidates claiming affiliation with political parties would have to meet Indiana’s two-party rule: their most recent two primary votes must match the party they seek to represent. If not, they need a county party chair’s O.K.
That could block thousands of Hoosiers from running, along with a federal law barring employees from partisan activities.
The Indiana School Boards Association (ISBA) mourned the move Monday evening.
Executive Director Terry Spradlin said his organization has “fought against” the push for partisan school board elections for multiple years — but will adjust once it’s in effect July 1.
“Once elected, ISBA will encourage school board members to leave politics at the board room door by working collaboratively to focus on what is best for our 1 million public school students,” Spradlin continued, in a statement. “School board members should also conduct themselves in a manner that models effective board governance practices regardless of party affiliation.”
Another provision would raise board member pay from the current $2,000 maximum by tying compensation to 10% of starting teacher salaries. The state has a $40,000 minimum — which would double school board pay — but Braun wants to land at $45,000.

The no-excuse absentee voting period has been in effect since August 2022 and allows voters to cast their ballot in elections in person or by mail starting two weeks before Election Day.
Supporters of the bill said they hoped that extending the no-excuse voting period would further alleviate stress on election workers and encourage voters to cast their ballot.
The state of Missouri ran March presidential primaries from 2000 until 2020. A 2022 law signed by former Gov. Mike Parson eliminated them. In 2024, the Republican Party held in-person caucuses in Missouri to select their delegates, while Democrats opted for a hybrid caucus with in-person voting and a mail-in ballot.
Low participation in these caucuses, alongside vocal blowback from residents who preferred the state-run primaries, were cited as motivators for reinstating the primaries.
“I believe it’s a lot simpler for our residents of our state going to cast a ballot like they do it in every other way for their preference for the presidential primary,” said state Rep. Brad Banderman, a Republican St. Clair.
Under the bill primaries would be held on the first Tuesday of March during presidential election years. The estimated cost to the state for conducting the primaries is $8 million.
The bill’s supporters also noted that unlike previous years, where the primary results have not been binding to party delegates, both political parties have agreed to adhere to the results for the first ballot at their respective party conventions.
The House needs to approve the legislation one more time before it heads to the Senate.

Supreme Court will decide if the state overstepped its authority in taking over Paterson police in 2023 after a controversial killing.,"Paterson officials say no state law explicitly empowered Attorney General Matt Platkin to declare control of their 300-officer force in 2023. (Dana DiFilippo | New Jersey Monitor)Almost two years after the state took over the troubled Paterson Police Department, attorneys argued before the New Jersey Supreme Court Monday over whether it had the authority to do so.
Paterson officials, who sued the state seven months after the March 2023 takeover, have asserted that no state law explicitly empowered Attorney General Matt Platkin to declare control of the 300-officer force. Instead, under home rule, only municipalities have direct operational oversight of local police departments, said attorney Christopher Gramiccioni, who represents Paterson Mayor Andre Sayegh and other officials.
State officials, though, have cited several laws they say gave Platkin that authority. Deputy Solicitor General Michael Zuckerman insisted the takeover, which came after a controversial and deadly police encounter, lies squarely within Platkin’s duties to ensure both public confidence in law enforcement and the uniform, efficient application of criminal laws statewide.
While a state appeals panel sided with Paterson in December, the rapid-fire questions the Supreme Court justices showered on Gramiccioni, Zuckerman, and other attorneys over two hours of arguments Monday suggests the appellate ruling might not stand.
Dominating the discussion were two state laws both sides cited to make their case — the 1970 Criminal Justice Act, which designated the attorney general as the state’s chief law enforcement officer, and a 2023 law known as Chapter 94 that state legislators passed after the Paterson takeover to facilitate it.
Gramiccioni argued that state legislators never intended to empower the state attorney general to seize control of municipal police departments because neither law explicitly spells out such authority. The Criminal Justice Act allows county prosecutors to take over local agencies, but only with the agency’s consent, he added.
Zuckerman countered that the attorney general’s takeover power is “strongly implied, if it’s not expressly granted.”
“If the attorney general can supersede a county prosecutor, and the county prosecutor can supersede municipally, it follows that the attorney general can supersede municipal law enforcement directly,” he said.
Justice Fabiana Pierre-Louis pushed back on any claim that consent is needed.
“Where in the statutes does it tell us that there has to be consent in order for such supersession to occur?” she said.
Gramiccioni conceded consent isn’t expressly required by law.
The justices also zeroed in on Chapter 94, which authorized the attorney general, when superseding a law enforcement agency, to appoint an officer in charge who hasn’t completed training through the state Police Training Commission as long as the officer completes the training within one year of appointment. That became an issue when Platkin appointed Isa Abbassi, a New York Police Department veteran, to replace Paterson’s chief, Engelbert Ribeiro, after the takeover.
The law did not mention Paterson, but it might as well have, Justice Rachel Wainer Apter said. Under the law’s verbiage, it specifically applies to “a city of the first class having a population of less than 200,000 according to the federal 2020 decennial census,” she noted.
“It seems to say everything it could, aside from ‘the City of Paterson.’ How can you argue that this is actually not referring to this particular supersession, and is instead referring to some other possible supersession where it was consensual?” Wainer Apter said.
The justices noted as further proof of a Paterson link that while Gov. Phil Murphy signed the law in July 2023, legislators made it retroactive to March 1, 2023. Platkin announced his office’s takeover of Paterson on March 27, 2023.
Chief Justice Stuart Rabner also pointed to state funding allocated to effectuate the Paterson takeover.
“So the Legislature authorized $18 million for the attorney general’s takeover of the Paterson Police Department, but you view that as — how does one view that if not actual validation and support for what the attorney general has done?” Rabner said.
Zuckerman backed up that sentiment, saying: “If the Legislature had felt our reading was the wrong one, they would have told us to knock it off, and instead, they partnered with us and helped support this particular supersession.”
Gramiccioni exhorted justices to weigh only the statutory language rather than inferring legislative intent through “collective sources of law.”
“I would submit this: It’s the law that holds the supreme power, not a monarch who is basically creating this out of thin air, on a whim, on when he can go in and supersede a municipal police department,” Gramiccioni said.
But Zuckerman urged justices to regard Chapter 94 and the state funding as proof of legislative intent that the attorney general has the power to take over police departments in rare, warranted cases, such as Paterson, where police have a long history of brutality and civil rights violations that local officials have failed to stop.
“Our Legislature has provided unusually striking evidence, not only that it understood and intended for supersessions like this one to be lawful, but also that it was working with the executive branch to help this very supersession succeed,” Zuckerman said. “That is fatal to the challengers’ position.”
Henal Patel, an attorney for the New Jersey Institute of Social Justice who argued Monday in favor of the takeover, told justices that supersession is an important tool legislators gave the attorney general to restore trust when police have broken it. She pointed to the deaths of several residents at the hands of Paterson police, including Najee Seabrooks, a community activist who officers gunned down after he called 911 for help during a mental crisis.
“The legislative intent here was to provide the AG with broad powers to rebuild public trust, including supersession powers, and New Jersey’s AG properly exercised that power,” Patel said. “I want to emphasize the stakes here. If this court were to affirm the appellate division’s opinion, the people of Paterson, especially its Black and brown residents, will be left without justice, and public trust would remain broken.”
Attorney Vito A. Gagliardi Jr., representing the New Jersey State Association of Chiefs of Police, urged justices to set standards for supersession, saying police and municipal leaders deserve clarity on why the state would take over their force and advance notice when that occurs.
Zuckerman told the justices that while county prosecutors have taken over municipal police forces at least 17 times in recent decades, state takeovers of local police departments are historically rare in New Jersey. Besides Paterson, the attorney general’s office took over the embattled Camden police department in 1998, and that department disbanded altogether in 2013.
“This office has never done it other than those two times,” Zuckerman said. “So I think that tells you everything you need to know about how we view it as a break-the-glass kind of tool, as opposed to a just-do-it-because-you-feel-like-it kind of tool.”

(Henry Redman | Wisconsin Examiner)Wisconsin’s spring election takes place Tuesday, with voters across the state weighing in on the races for state Supreme Court and superintendent of schools, a constitutional amendment and local offices.
Polls open at 7 a.m. and close at 8 p.m. Voters who are already in line to vote when polls close should remain in line and will still be able to cast their ballots. Absentee ballots must be returned by the time polls close and can be returned to a voter’s polling place or municipal clerk’s office. Information on polling places can be found at MyVote.WI.gov. 
Hundreds of thousands of Wisconsinites have already cast their ballots, surpassing the early vote turnout of the 2023 Supreme Court race when 1.8 million people voted. On the Monday before the election that year, more than 409,000 ballots had already been cast. This year, more than 644,000 votes have already been cast, with Dane and Milwaukee counties each seeing the most turnout. More than 100,000 votes have already been cast in both counties. 
While the lower turnout of spring elections means results usually come faster than in presidential elections, state law still doesn’t allow election officials to begin processing absentee ballots until polls open on Election Day. Last year, Republicans in the state Senate killed a bill that would have allowed absentee ballots to start being processed on the Monday before the election. This means that especially in Milwaukee, where all absentee ballots are processed and counted at one central count location, results may take longer to come in. 
Supreme Court race
The race for Wisconsin Supreme Court is the most consequential on the ballot on Tuesday, with the ideological balance of the body up for grabs. Liberal-backed Dane County Judge Susan Crawford is taking on conservative-backed Waukesha County Judge Brad Schimel. The winner will replace retiring Justice Ann Walsh Bradley. 
Wisconsin is holding the first statewide election in the country since President Donald Trump was elected last November. That opportunity to test the voting public’s mood, and the $20 million that Trump adviser Elon Musk has pumped into the race to support Schimel, has turned the race into a referendum on the first months of the second Trump administration. 
Musk appeared at a rally in Green Bay on Sunday night to advocate for Schimel, give $1 million to two attendees and hype up his Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), which has been making drastic cuts to federal agencies and programs. 
Schimel has said he is running to remove partisanship from the Court and that if elected he would  treat Trump like any other litigant in a case. But he also told a group of canvassers associated with Trump-aligned Turning Point USA that he’d be a “support network” for Trump on the Court and, the Washington Post reported, told a group of Republicans in Jefferson County that Trump was “screwed over” by the Court when it ruled against Trump’s efforts to overturn the results of  the 2020 election. 
Democrats and Crawford’s campaign have accused Musk of attempting to buy a seat on the state Supreme Court. They point to Musk’s current litigation in Wisconsin challenging a state law that prevents Tesla from selling cars directly to consumers. Democrats have held People v. Musk town halls across the state where attendees said they were worried about DOGE’s cuts to Social Security, Medicaid and education. 
At the only debate between the two candidates in March, Crawford called her opponent “Elon Schimel.” Crawford has said if elected she’ll be a justice who seeks to protect the rights of all Wisconsinites while Schimel has said he’s running to counter the alleged partisanship of the Court since liberals won a majority in 2023. 
The race for Supreme Court has set the record for most expensive judicial campaign in U.S. history. The race recently surpassed the $100 million mark, nearly doubling the record set by Wisconsin’s 2023 Supreme Court election when more than $50 million was spent in the race between Justice Janet Protasiewicz and former Justice Dan Kelly. 
While the race has been nationalized, the winner will hold a deciding vote in cases that could decide how Wisconsin’s congressional maps are drawn, how pollution is regulated, the collective bargaining rights of the state’s workers and if Wisconsin women have the right to access an abortion.
Superintendent of Schools
Also on the ballot on Tuesday is the race for superintendent of schools. The race is between incumbent Jill Underly, supported by the state Democratic party, and Brittany Kinser, an education consultant who’s been backed by the state Republican Party. 
The two candidates appeared together at just one virtual forum, with Underly declining to attend a number of proposed events. Kinser has criticized Underly’s effort to change the standards used to assess student progress and advocated for more support for the state’s “school choice” programs including taxpayer-funded private school vouchers. 
Underly is endorsed by the state’s teachers union and says she will defend  public schools against privatization efforts by school choice advocates such as Kinser. 
Voter ID amendment
Voters will also weigh in on a proposed constitutional amendment to codify the state’s voter ID law. The Republican-authored proposal would require that voters provide a photo ID to register to vote, which is already the law. Republicans say the amendment is necessary to prevent the state  Supreme Court from striking down the voter ID requirement. Republicans have increasingly used the constitutional amendment process in recent years as a way to shape state law, avoiding Democratic Gov. Tony Evers’ veto.

Andrew Ireland, R-Indianapolis, introduces a bill barring public entities from funding 'obscene performances' on March 31, 2025. (Whitney Downard/Indiana Capital Chronicle)A bill that left the Senate with near-universal support picked up a “barnacle in committee,” as one House Democrat put it last week, leaving the House on a 71-20 vote Monday.
The House additions widen the scope of the underlying bill beyond an effort to replace a criminal term throughout Indiana code to include a focus on obscene performances. 
As originally written, Senate Bill 326 would have replaced “child pornography” with “child sex abuse material,” acknowledging that children are being sexually abused in such images. But a House committee added a new provision: barring government entities from using public money to fund, organize or host “obscene performances.” 
‘Obscene performance’ ban added to child abuse bill, official misconduct expungements weighed

A House floor amendment, which moved largely along party lines, also added a method of enforcement by allowing people to sue Indiana entities for alleged incidents. 
“Language shapes the way we understand and confront these issues and the term child pornography is not only inaccurate, it minimizes the horror of the crimes committed. Pornography implies a level of consent and children cannot consent,” said House sponsor Rep. Andrew Ireland. “… we’re taking an important step to save our Hoosier children.” 
The Indianapolis Republican said the language regarding obscene performances would ensure “that public funds are never used to support the exploitation of children.”
Defining something as obscene has to meet a high bar, known as the “Miller Test.” That work must be based on an average person’s reaction and consider the entire work, not just an isolated portion. 
But critics maintained that such performances aren’t happening, noting there are already penalties regardless of someone’s government affiliation. 
“More and more this General Assembly is taking itself to an alternate reality where it legislates against problems that don’t exist,” said Rep. Matt Pierce, D-Bloomington. “We create a strawman and then we knock it down and ‘Look at us! We really solved that problem!’
“The problem never existed. But it appeals to somebody out there, so we do it now.” 
 Further discussion

Ireland didn’t cite specific instances of obscene performances using taxpayer dollars on Monday nor in his testimony last week when he introduced the penalty language. 
It also doesn’t limit such legal action to only Indiana residents, meaning that, according to Pierce, “any person in the universe can sue your local government when they’re offended by somebody and try to make an argument that it’s obscene.”
Pierce was one of the committee members to advance the bill, noting the high bar to meet the state’s obscenity standard, which he dubbed a “barnacle” on the House floor last week. In addition to the Miller test, a litigant would generally need to prove they have been harmed by obscene performances — a barrier meant to tamp down on frivolous lawsuits. 
  Rep. Matt Pierce, D-Bloomington, speaks on a bill on March 31, 2025. (Whitney Downard/Indiana Capital Chronicle)
But Pierce said the language eviscerates that and says “we don’t care if they’re harmed or not. We don’t care if they have a direct injury.”
Municipalities may still need to spend their dollars defending themselves from such accusations, which could include plays, poetry and drag shows. 
“Keep in mind, anybody involved in this supposed obscene performance that local government might be funding can already be arrested and imprisoned under our current (law),” Pierce continued. “I would think the fear of going to prison would keep local officials from going into the smut-peddling business.”
Ireland agreed with Pierce that such obscene performances “have never occurred and I hope never occur … in part, thanks to this bill.”
“This is nothing new under the sun,” concluded Ireland. 
The final vote tally split both parties, though only Ireland and Pierce spoke on the measure. It now goes to the Senate, which must vote to accept or reject the House amendments before the bill can advance.

(Courtesy image)OKLAHOMA CITY — The construction of a new inpatient mental health hospital is $124 million over budget, and House budget leaders do not want taxpayers to pick up the tab. 
The Donahue Behavioral Health Campus, located in Oklahoma City, was budgeted for $147 million and broke ground in March 2024. It would serve adults and adolescents with 330 beds when completed, an increase in capacity by 100 beds from the Griffin Memorial Hospital, in Norman, it is intended to replace. 
But in its budget request to the Legislature for the 2026 fiscal year, the Oklahoma Department of Mental Health and Substance Abuse Services asked for another $124 million to cover overrun costs. The House recommended not fulfilling this request. 
Rep. Trey Caldwell, R-Faxon, chair of the House Appropriations and Budget Committee, said House leaders believe the Donahue project is too costly and a cheaper alternative must be found. 
“The House position is we want to do something transformational when it comes to shortening that waitlist, especially when it comes to mental health issues,” he said. “The Donahue build-out, as it stands right now, not only has come in over budget, but also had hiccups along the lines of, they forgot to put bathrooms in. … There’s a facility out there that I think we can purchase for about 15% of what it would cost to build the Donahue, and we want to get that done.”
He said there’s no “firm commitment” from the governor, the Senate or the Mental Health Department on this recommendation, but the House is working to see this plan come to fruition. 
In December, Oklahoma Watch reported the budget shortfall and that the opening of the hospital could potentially be pushed to 2028, rather than the scheduled 2026 date, due to unexpected costs, changes in the layout and number of bathrooms, and inflation. 
Kelsey Davis, a spokesperson for the Mental Health Department, said there are no updates from the agency on their next steps or the reason for the cost overrun. 
The agency is actively working through what the future of the project will look like if the Legislature opts not to provide the extra funding, she said. 
Lawmakers committed $87 million in pandemic relief funds to the project. Oklahoma City leaders and county commissioners also contributed funding, with additional dollars expected to come from the sale of the Griffin Memorial Hospital land.

 Sen. Liz Brown, R-Fort Wayne (Courtesy Indiana Senate Republicans)
But an amendment approved Monday by the House Judiciary Committee seeks to compromise by “streamlining the process” for courts to quickly seal some records — meaning renters would not have to file anything on their own.
That includes eviction cases in which a judge sides with a tenant, or when a judgment against the tenant is later reversed.
A state law passed in 2022 already opened the door for some eviction matters to be sealed, but it’s currently up to tenants to file for expungement.
Statehouse testimony on the latest bill draft was positive. The measure passed 10-1 — only Rep. J.D. Prescott, R-Union City, voted in opposition — and now heads to the full House.
“The idea is, let’s get those (evictions) expunged, because, as you know, that’s like a black mark, and it makes it difficult for (tenants) to find housing,” said bill author Sen. Liz Brown, R-Fort Wayne. “The idea is now, with this amended bill, (tenants) are going to have skin in the game. If they really want that to be expunged, they’re going to have to go in and do that. But so many of these eviction proceedings have been resolved, and both sides on the claim are happy, and there was just no way for them to clear the name, and I think this is a good start.”
Changes to the bill
When first introduced, Brown’s bill would have required courts to automatically seal an eviction from a tenant’s record, as long as they have settled their debt, or the court ruled in their favor. Cases would qualify, too, if the eviction was dismissed by, overturned or vacated on appeal.
The original bill also sought to automatically seal all eviction cases after seven years.
The seven-year seal was removed by a Senate committee, however. Later, in the full chamber, a separate amendment further watered down the automatic sealing — shifting the burden back to renters to file expungement paperwork with their local court, which is how the process currently works.
Amendment author Sen. Aaron Freeman, R-Indianapolis, said he didn’t want to overburden the courts and additionally wants tenants to be held accountable for evictions.
Monday’s House committee amendment specifies that a court, “on its own motion,” can expunge eviction records as long as one of the following applies to the case:

the eviction action is dismissed by the court
a judgment in favor of the tenant is entered by the court
a judgment is entered by the court against the tenant, and the judgment is subsequently overturned or vacated on appeal

While not automatic, renters would further be able to seek expungement seven years after the conclusion of a case in which there was no money owed to the landlord.
There’s no waiting period, though, for tenants who have “satisfied” — paid back — a money judgment related to the eviction.
 Rep. Chris Jeter, R-Fishers (Leslie Bonilla Muñiz/Indiana Capital Chronicle)
Committee chairman Rep. Chris Jeter, R-Fishers, said courts typically don’t take action in a case until “somebody files a motion asking them to do something.” 
“I think there was a little concern about tasking the courts with sort of keeping track of where these evictions are at,” Jeter said. Evictions filed before 2021, for example, do not have case numbers to distinguish them from other small claims cases.
“I think one of the landing grounds we kind of came on is if it’s an order at the time when the judge (decides in favor of) the tenant, then they can seal (the eviction record) at that exact same time,” he continued. “But if it’s after, I think the thought is that we at least have the tenant take the proactive step of filing at least a one-page motion, or something, so the court can act.”
She emphasized that tenant-landlord bill are typically “difficult” and tough to pass out of legislative committees.
“The idea is there are good landlords, and there are good tenants. And frankly, when there is an eviction proceeding — whether it’s a judgment, or a question of security deposits or damages in the resolve — it’s not really the landlord’s responsibility anymore. Their claim has been resolved, and they’re fine. I don’t think they necessarily want that tenant to have that black mark on them … but that’s the case right now,” Brown said.
“This will make it seamless for the tenant,” she added. “They’re already in court — it will make it automatic. … And there’s no reason, if the landlord has not pursued the judgment in seven years, why that, on the motion of the tenant, can’t also get expunged.”
Housing advocates supportive
Housing advocates were supportive of the amended bill and maintained that eviction sealing is “very important” for tenants because landlords won’t be able to see past eviction cases when screening potential tenants. 
“Community stakeholders who are trying to create a new supply of housing and connect it with Hoosiers too often find that many Hoosiers don’t qualify for housing because they have that ‘Scarlet E’ of an eviction filing on their record,” said Andrew Bradley, with Prosperity Indiana. He pointed to data showing that 71,000 evictions were filed in the state over the last year.
“That’s a significant number of Hoosiers who now can qualify for safe, decent, affordable housing,” he said.

– Andrew Bradley, with Prosperity Indiana


Brown crafted the legislation with input from students at the University of Notre Dame’s Eviction Clinic, which helps Hoosiers clear an eviction off their record for free.
David Pruitt, director of the university’s Clinical Law Center, said a majority of the eviction clinic’s cases stem from just “one incident” in a renter’s life. 
“There’s a medical bill, or a loss of a job, or something comes up, and the margins are so thin for people that they get knocked off track, and it’s hard for them to come up,” Pruitt said. “There are going to be some people that, honestly, are over their skis and they just found a place that’s just too expensive — and those are tough cases. And then you’ve got mixes of landlords being problematic, tenants being problematic. … But I would say that for significantly more than half of the individuals, it’s a razor’s edge.”
Indiana Legal Services, the largest provider of free civil legal aid to low-income Hoosiers, additionally worked on more than 1,600 eviction sealing cases last year.
“That’s a testament for the need for eviction sealing and the assistance that folks currently need to kind of get through the system,” said Jennifer Terry, an attorney with the nonprofit law firm. “We do see this bill as a good next step in streamlining some of those processes.”

“When the Abundant Life shooting happened, which was at a private Christian School very close to my home, it was just a really horrible day, and I think I realized it’s too late to talk about this,” Muldrow said. “It’s been too late and we can’t keep letting it be too late.”
A teacher and student were killed and six others were injured by a 15-year-old who brought a gun to Abundant Life Christian School, a private school in Madison, in December 2024. It is the deadliest school shooting on record in Wisconsin.
The shooting made national headlines, but it is just one example of children harmed by gun violence. According to the K-12 School Shooting Database, there were 332 school shootings in 2024. A 2024 report by Johns Hopkins Center for Gun Violence Solutions found firearms continue to be a leading cause of death for children and teens, and those who are Black are disproportionately the victims
Muldrow, who is running unopposed for another term on the Board this spring, said measures taken to try to prevent shooting deaths at school have not been enough. 
“All of the things that we’ve done to our students haven’t resolved this issue — whether it’s practicing and having drills or whether it’s making our schools harder places to get into,” Muldrow said. “None of that changes the reality that a 15-year-old went into their school, two guns, and killed multiple people, including themselves.”
Students from Madison Metropolitan School District walked out of class in December and marched to the state Capitol to demand something be done about gun violence. 
“They asked for two things,” Muldrow said. “They asked for laws related to gun storage and gun safety, and they asked for more mental health support within their education.”  
Muldrow said that adults should “honor” the demands of the students and build bridges across political divides to get the work done. She said having conversations is an important starting point. 
In the aftermath of the Madison school shooting, Muldrow said she wanted to organize an event to inspire people in the community to feel capable of making change. She turned to a group that tried to find solutions after a school shooting took place about two years ago and more than 620 miles away.
Tennesseans were left reeling in 2023 after a shooter killed three 9-year-olds and three adults at the private Christian Covenant elementary school. A nonprofit organization called Builders (formerly known as Starts With Us) that seeks to ease political polarization brought together a group of 11 Tennessee residents with a range of opinions on the issue of guns to discuss and come up with some solutions. 
Muldrow was part of a similar group in Wisconsin in 2024 that explored the debate on abortion. She saw a documentary about the Tennessee group and thought its approach could be a way for the community affected by the Abundant Life shooting to come together and find a way forward. 
Muldrow said that the point of the event she helped organize Sunday was not necessarily to “mirror or mimic what happened in Tennessee, but to learn from that collaborative attitude towards solutions.” 
More than 100 people attended the event at the Overture Center for the Arts in Madison, which included a screening of the documentary about the Tennesseeans’ journey and a panel discussion with two of the participants and a handful of Wisconsinites.

Charles Franklin, director of the Marquette Law School Poll noted during the panel that potential solutions to gun violence would look different for Wisconsin, given the difference in state laws and the general beliefs of residents in each state. A key point of disagreement among participants in the documentary centered on concealed carry permits and whether they should be mandated. Tennessee has allowed for permitless carry of handguns since 2021.
Wisconsin already requires a permit for concealed carry, however, and it’s mostly not a partisan debate, Franklin said. According to the most recent polling, about 65% of Wisconsinites support concealed carry, but only under certain circumstances. 
“We do have a concealed carry law that requires a permit. When the Legislature has considered concealed carry without a permit, we found only about 20% support for that, about 80% opposition,” Franklin said. “There is a distinction that the public makes… public opinion is quite opposed to that form of concealed carry, but solidly in favor of [concealed carry] with a permit.”
Franklin said he thought proposals that originate from and garner support among Second Amendment supporters should be celebrated. He noted that there is a Republican bill that’s been introduced in Wisconsin that would create a tax exemption for gun safes. 
“That’s a small, incremental matter of, what, 5 ½% on the cost of the safe, but on the other hand, when you think of children’s access to guns in the home, access to those guns by burglars or other circumstances,” it could be a significant step, Franklin said. 
Franklin said the idea that “if you don’t get everything you’ve got nothing” is a huge barrier to progress. 
“I would just stress that incremental improvements are still improvements,” Franklin said.
Steve D’Orazio, founder and president of the Oregon, Wis., gun shop and range Max Creek Outdoors said during the panel that his business works hard to educate people who acquire guns. He said he has been working with a doctor at the UW Health System to educate doctors on guns and have them talk with their patients about gun safety and awareness, including keeping guns locked away. 
“My goal is the safety of our children,” D’Orazio said. 
The solution to school shootings he emphasized the most was implementing metal detectors in all schools. 
“Every one of us here today walked through the front door of this building and we walked through a metal detector, but our schools don’t have metal detectors,” D’Orazio said. “I sell guns. That’s our business. There’s so much education that we do at our shop to make sure that the gun owner doesn’t get hurt and that they use it correctly…, but every school district should have a metal detector. That’s how you’re going to stop this stuff.” 
The documentary shows the Tennessee group taking and presenting their recommendations at the Tennessee State Capitol. Those recommendations included temporary removal of firearms based on risk of violence, developing tools to support responsible gun ownership, expanding the role of school resource officers, investing in community to reduce trauma and developing gun literacy resources for schools, communities and media. 
Tennessee leaders did pass a bill in 2024 requiring education in schools about guns, a policy similar to the recommendation of the group. Though the end result was not exactly as participants imagined it. 
Adam Luke, a Tennessee marriage and family counselor and conservative, spoke to how the “rush to be right” by lawmakers on the issue may diminish the effectiveness of the legislation.  
“People will not be able to opt out [of the curriculum]. Now, I would like to turn to conservative America and say, ‘If you did not have the ability to opt your child out of sex education would that bother you?’” Luke asked. “This is what happens when you have super majorities.” 
Luke said that the Tennessee Department of Education also doesn’t have the curriculum for teachers and just recently closed the public response period. He said lawmakers were so quick to want to get something done that they’ve created a policy that may not be effective.
“Let’s say that we did something, but guess what? We forgot to actually give you the resources to be successful with it,” Luke said. 
Political polarization was on display following the Madison school shooting. Muldrow said she has been “saddened” by the divide.
“It’s really hard to see our Legislature be so divided and in such a contentious relationship with our governor, and it’s a shame because all of these people represent us and there is an expectation that they work together,” Muldrow said. 
  “When the Abundant Life shooting happened, which was at a private Christian School very close to my home, it was just a really horrible day, and I think I realized it’s too late to talk about this,” Madison School Board member Ali Muldrow said. Photo by Baylor Spears/Wisconsin Examiner.
Since the shooting, Gov. Tony Evers has launched the Office of Violence Prevention and has proposed adopting further gun safety policies including stricter background checks and red flag laws. Republican lawmakers were quick to criticize Evers’ proposals and have been developing their own proposals for addressing school shootings, including financial support for the Office of School Safety and allowing teachers to be armed. 
The Madison Common Council and the Dane County Board of Supervisors both passed resolutions urging the Legislature to take action and implement common-sense gun measures. 
Steven Olikara, a former candidate for Wisconsin Senate and founder of the nonpartisan organization the Future Caucus, said the actions of local leaders and Evers are a step forward, but the state needs to take bigger steps. 
“Those bigger steps will come from bringing Democrats and Republicans together in a real way and building trust,” Olikara said. “And I think conversations like this can help create that kind of momentum. [When people are at] each other’s throats, the kind of progress you make is very small and very incremental. When you have conversations like the one today, you can reach transformative change, and that’s really what we need.”
Tennessee educator Alyssa Pearman, who lost one of her students to gun violence, said the key is to keep showing up to have the conversations.
“You are going to be told no, and you are going to have people who have no interest in making a change and being a builder, but you keep showing up,” Pearman said. “You find people who want to do something, who want a better tomorrow, and you have conversations like these… This is the type of conversation that needs to be had, whether it’s in Wisconsin, whether it’s in Tennessee and whatever state where we have this crisis.”

Some estimates have pegged the damages and economic losses from the fires at more than $250 billion. “We’ve had disaster after disaster after disaster,” said Assemblymember Dawn Addis, a Democrat. [&#8230;]","Anna Schlobohm de Cruder stands for a portrait in March amid the remains of her Altadena, Calif., home, which was destroyed in the Eaton Fire early this year.

(Mario Tama/Getty Images)For many California residents, the Los Angeles wildfires earlier this year were the latest and most searing example of the devastating effects of climate change. Some estimates have pegged the damages and economic losses from the fires at more than $250 billion.
“We’ve had disaster after disaster after disaster,” said Assemblymember Dawn Addis, a Democrat. “It’s the taxpayers and the insurance ratepayers that are bearing the cost. It’s not sustainable, it’s not right and it’s not ethical.”
Addis and Democratic lawmakers in nearly a dozen other states want to force the world’s largest fossil fuel companies to help pay for the recovery costs of climate-related disasters. Last year, Vermont became the first state to pass a “climate Superfund” law, followed soon after by New York.
This session, 10 states have seen similar proposals, several of which have advanced in key committees. Advocates point to legislation in Maryland that has drawn support in both chambers, as well as to strong grassroots support in California after the Los Angeles wildfires.
Lawmakers say the rapidly increasing cost of climate disasters — from wildfires to floods to sea level rise — is more than state budgets can bear.
“Climate Superfund is the ‘it girl’ policy of the [2025] session,” said Ava Gallo, climate and energy program manager with the National Caucus of Environmental Legislators, a forum for state lawmakers. “There’s a lot of popularity in the idea of holding polluters responsible.”
The momentum for these “polluter pays” bills is tied to the maturation of attribution science. That new field of research can help calculate fossil fuel companies’ contributions to historic emissions totals, as well as the role climate change played in causing or worsening natural disasters.
Vermont’s law was the first attempt to use that science to charge emitters for their role in causing devastating floods and other catastrophes.












We've had disaster after disaster after disaster. It's the taxpayers and the insurance ratepayers that are bearing the cost. It's not sustainable, it's not right and it’s not ethical.


– California Democratic Assemblymember Dawn Addis




Fossil fuel companies and their allies have fought back hard. Late last year, the American Petroleum Institute and the U.S. Chamber of Commerce filed a lawsuit challenging Vermont’s measure. The groups argue that emissions are governed by the federal Clean Air Act, precluding states from charging companies over global pollution.
Neither group responded to a Stateline interview request. The Independent Petroleum Association of America also declined an interview request.
A separate lawsuit, led by 22 Republican attorneys general, is challenging the New York law. And a conservative group has targeted Rachel Rothschild, an assistant professor of law at the University of Michigan Law School, who helped draft the legal justification for climate Superfund policy. The group, Government Accountability and Oversight, has sought to subject Rothschild to a deposition, The New York Times reported, a move that some experts view as an intimidation tactic.
Meanwhile, oil and gas executives asked President Donald Trump during a White House meeting this month to direct the Justice Department to join the legal fight against climate Superfund laws, The Wall Street Journal reported. Industry leaders are also pushing Congress to shield them from more than 30 lawsuits brought by state and local governments that aim to make them pay for some of the results of climate change.
While experts expect a bruising legal battle over climate Superfund policies, the threat of lawsuits hasn’t deterred more lawmakers from backing the concept.
“States were a little bit wary; they wondered, ‘Is this some new radical plan?’” said Cassidy DiPaola, communications director with the Make Polluters Pay campaign, a coalition of groups backing such bills. “Then one of the littlest states passed it and this powerhouse, New York, passed it. That really set the ball rolling.”
Fossil fuel companies have cast doubt on attribution science. They also note that their production of oil and other products was done legally under U.S. and international regulations.
“Manufacturers will see this as a shakedown of any industry you don’t like at some point in the future, even though in the past they were licensed and operated under government regulation,” Brett Vassey, president and CEO of the Virginia Manufacturers Association, said during legislative testimony about a climate Superfund proposal in that state. “It will have a chilling effect on Virginia being able to grow its economy.”
Proponents of Superfund legislation point to legal settlements with large tobacco companies in the 1990s. Although those companies also sold their products legally, they were held responsible because they knew about the harmful effects of those products and deceived the public. Most climate Superfund proposals target companies for their emissions over the past 30 or so years, after leading experts had documented the dangers of greenhouse gases.
“There’s good documentation of how well the fossil fuel industry knew the probable long-term impacts of their product,” said Oregon state Sen. Jeff Golden, a Democrat. “Should an industry that made such historic profits over a period of time and made so many representations that we had no problem not bear any of the costs?”
Golden and other lawmakers say it’s becoming impossible for taxpayers to cover the costs of recovery from wildfires and other catastrophes. In Rhode Island, sea level rise is causing massive damage for coastal communities, said Democratic state Rep. Jennifer Boylan, who has sponsored a climate Superfund bill to help the state adapt.
Some advocates also note that Trump’s return to the White House has cut off the possibility of federal climate relief.
“All the states are affected by the disappearance of this federal funding,” said Gallo, of the state lawmakers group. “States everywhere are going to be looking at some way to fill the gap.”
This session, climate Superfund bills have been introduced in California, Connecticut, Hawaii, Maryland, Massachusetts, New Jersey, Oregon, Rhode Island, Tennessee and Virginia.
While the bills are structured differently, they all seek to target the largest polluters — often covering companies that produced 1 billion metric tons of emissions over the last 30 or so years. Lawmakers say that applies to roughly 100 companies.
The measures also take different approaches to assigning damages. Some direct state agencies to conduct complex studies to determine the costs of climate-caused disasters over a certain period, the approach pioneered by Vermont. Others set a fixed number that represents a conservative baseline for those damages. New York’s law set that figure at $75 billion over a 25-year period.
Many of the bills also require that significant amounts of the funding be directed to the communities hit hardest by pollution.
Advocates are particularly optimistic about the measures in California and Maryland.
Lawmakers in Maryland modified their bills to commission a study about the financial impacts of climate change. Those measures passed both the House and Senate, and legislators are working to reconcile the versions from each chamber. Figures produced by the study would be the backbone of a climate Superfund policy in a future session.
“From a legislative perspective, it’s a shot in the dark as to what the costs are,” said Democratic Del. David Fraser-Hidalgo, who sponsored one of the bills. “This will give us the factual data needed to make a more well-educated decision on policy.”
In New Jersey, an Assembly committee advanced a climate Superfund bill this month. State Sen. Bob Smith, a Democrat who chairs the Environment and Energy Committee and who sponsored the bill, said it will help to rebuild and fortify water treatment plants, schools and firehouses. He noted that Trump has called for the dismantling of the Federal Emergency Management Agency.
“The end of the world is coming; it’s kind of hard to ignore,” Smith said. “FEMA has been the backstop to help communities recover from disasters. If the handwriting isn’t on the wall to all the states that they’ve got to deal with this, shame on them.”
Lawmakers in many states have heard from mayors and other local government leaders that more climate recovery funding is essential.
“Municipal officials are getting behind [climate Superfund policies],” said Massachusetts state Sen. Jamie Eldridge, a Democrat who has sponsored similar legislation. “They’re facing the costs of flooding, of droughts, of heat waves, and really asking for relief.”

He was [&#8230;]","A montage created by the Montana Historical Society of people arrested and convicted of seditious speech during the World War I era. This photo is by no means exhaustive. Seventy-two Montanans were charged, tried and convicted for running afoul of the Montana Sedition Act. Early on the morning of April 13, 1918, a group of Billings residents surrounded the house of Herman Bausch, which happens to be right across the street from where I live now. Bausch was a German immigrant who had moved to Billings a few years earlier and started farming just outside of town. He was highly respected in Billings for being a bit of an innovator, one of the first locals to plant an orchard. 
But that morning, he was confronted by a mob because he had been included on a list of Billings residents that had not purchased Liberty bonds to help support America’s entry into World War I. Bausch had stated: “I am opposed to war…all war that is aggressive and oppressive. But if Wall Street plutocrats insist on further bloodshed, let them finance it. Voluntarily, I will not contribute financially to this world calamity.”
The mob pressed Bausch to change his mind and buy some Liberty bonds, and when he refused, they threatened to string him up in one of the apple trees in his yard. But instead they dragged him off to the local Elks Club, where a group of more than 50 people had gathered. This crowd spent several hours grilling Bausch, trying again to convince him to buy bonds, but he would not budge. So he was charged under the Montana Sedition Act, and sentenced to four years in prison. 
Teddy Roosevelt once said that patriotism means standing with one’s country, not standing with the president. But America has a checkered past when it comes to using patriotism as a cudgel to keep people from expressing themselves, and one of the most egregious examples of that started right here in Montana. 
When war broke out in Europe in 1914, Americans were almost universally opposed to becoming involved in the conflict. The overall sentiment was that the conflict was none of our business, but there was also a general feeling that it wouldn’t last long. But as the war dragged on, the allies—which included Great Britain, France, Russia, and China—pressed President Woodrow Wilson to change his mind. The longer it lasted, the more concerned they were about having the resources necessary to fight off the Axis, which consisted of Germany, Austria-Hungary, and Italy. 
Two major events played a huge role in swaying public sentiment. First, German U-boats sank the Lusitania, a British ocean liner, in 1915. The incident killed 1198 people, and 128 of them were American. 
The second event was the revelation in January 1917 that German Foreign Minister Arthur Zimmerman had carried out a secret diplomatic correspondence with the German Ambassador to Mexico, proposing that if Mexico joined forces with the Germans, Germany would help them regain control of Texas, Arizona and New Mexico. 
Although Wilson won reelection in 1916 on a platform of keeping Americans out of the war, it was just a few months after his inauguration that he declared war on Germany, and it was as if a switch had been flipped. A country that had been so firmly neutral suddenly developed a rabid form of nationalism.
Wilson established the Committee on Public Information, which distributed books and pamphlets, sent out speakers, and even made films, spreading strong opinions about German immigrants, and calling on everyone to buy Liberty bonds to support the war effort. In Montana, Gov. Sam Stewart got so caught up in this nationalist fervor that he called a special session of the Legislature just a few weeks after Wilson declared war, and convinced them to pass The Montana Sedition Act, which was an expansion of a previous bill called the Espionage Act. The Espionage Act was designed to pressure anyone who published works that undermined the war effort, but the Sedition Act took that sentiment one step further, encouraging local law enforcement to seek out people who simply spoke out against the war, or failed to show their support. During the next two years, 78 Montanans were convicted under the Sedition Act, most of whom were sentenced to 20 years. These people were not activists or troublemakers. They were farmers and salesman, and even housewives. 
One man, rancher Faye Rumsey, was sentenced to 20  years after a mob confronted him for not buying Liberty bonds, insisting that he kiss the American flag to show his loyalty. Another was convicted after saying that he wished the Kaiser would come over and straighten things out in his own county. 
Once the war ended, people came to their senses, and the Montana Sedition Act was repealed in 1921. The people serving sentences were released. But not before Herman Bausch lost his 2-year-old son and wasn’t allowed to travel from Deer Lodge to Billings for the funeral. And not before Faye Rumsey’s wife lost their ranch and had to give up all 12 of their children to the state. Many of these siblings never saw each other again. 
In 2006, Gov. Brian Schweitzer issued a pardon to everyone who had been convicted under the Sedition Act, and it was at that ceremony that several of Faye Rumsey’s grandchildren met for the first time. 
Herman Bausch was able to return to the house across the street from where I live and continue to farm, having more children. But extreme nationalism left its mark on his life, as it did on many innocent Montanans. As Bausch said when he was arrested, ‘If what I did was a crime, then there are thousands of other people in this country who are just as guilty as I am.”",https://dailymontanan.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Montanans-Sedition-History.jpeg,,,2025-04-01 07:00:39.924254

The proposed legislation (HB910/SB861) by Sen. John Stevens of Huntingdon and Rep. Johnny Garrett of Goodlettsville, both Republicans, would transfer the nonpartisan commission’s responsibilities to the Office of the Attorney General in a newly-created Civil Rights Enforcement Division.
Democrats on the panel questioned the need to dismantle the 60-year-old, independent commission responsible for enforcing civil rights laws in employment, housing and public accommodations – including investigations into claims of discrimination made against the state of Tennessee — and shift its responsibilities to Jonathan Skrmetti, who, as attorney general, has aggressively used the power of his office to champion conservative causes.
  Rep. Johnny Garrett (Photo: John Partipilo)
“I do have a concern with this attorney general making political decisions rather than legal decisions and — to the extent that threatens the civil rights of the citizens of Tennessee — I think we need to take a very very careful look at that,” said Rep. John Ray Clemmons, a Nashville Democrat.
Garrett said the Human Rights Commission was currently doing a “fine job” but giving the power of civil rights enforcement to the attorney general may serve as a greater deterrent to those accused of discrimination.
“I think if someone receives a letter or an action that the attorney general is investigating their actions, I think that’s going to perk up some people,” he said.
The proposed legislation alters the scope of discrimination claims that may be pursued against educational institutions.
The bill creates a pathway for those denied admission to schools on the basis of “race, color or national origin” — or participation in clubs or activities — to file complaints with the Attorney General, a provision widely understood to give white students a basis to file claims against educational institutions that have diversity, equity and inclusion policies.
But in response to a question from Rep. G.A. Hardaway about whether the genesis of the proposed law is “somehow related to reverse discrimination,” Garrett responded that he “did not know how to respond” to the question.
The bill also excludes disability and religion from the list of discriminatory activities in educational institutions that the attorney general would be required to investigate. Garrett noted that there remain federal avenues for pursuing those claims.
Bill to abolish discrimination watchdog agency advances in Tennessee Legislature

The bill would eliminate the Human Rights Commission by July 1, transferring 30 of its employees to the offices of the attorney general, who would then have the option to utilize employees at his discretion.
About 1,000 pending discrimination complaints before the commission would be dismissed, forcing the individuals who brought them – and the employers and institutions who have spent time and money defending themselves — to start anew, Muriel Malone Nolen, the commission’s executive director testified last week.
Individuals who have filed complaints would have the option of restarting their complaint within 90 days of the law taking effect, but Nolen noted that some of those actions may then fall out of a 180-day statute of limitations and no longer be viable.

(Antoinette Grajeda/Arkansas Advocate)About a hundred people gathered in Springdale Monday in support of immigrant workers, a group that rallygoers said have been the target of recent policies at the state and federal levels. 
The event was organized by Venceremos, a worker-based organization with a mission to ensure the human rights of poultry workers. The organization, whose name is Spanish for “we will overcome,” is led by executive director Magaly Licolli, who told the Advocate Friday that immigrants who were honored as essential workers during the COVID-19 pandemic are now being demonized. 
“Five years ago these workers were called essential workers, heroes, that without their jobs we wouldn’t have food on the table, and now they are being attacked and being called criminals,” Licolli said. 
President Donald Trump promised mass deportations on the campaign trail, and has followed through by invoking the Alien Enemies Act of 1789, supporting high-profile raids and revoking an extension of Temporary Protected Status for some immigrants, among other things. 
Trump’s policies have left immigrants living in fear as they’re being treated as “second-class citizens or no citizens at all,” Licolli said. 
While the national rhetoric started by targeting immigrants who were criminals, Licolli said the discussion has devolved into labeling all immigrants as criminals regardless of their immigration status. 
“We are seeing really that they are deporting anyone just because they are brown and being detained because they look brown until they prove they have the paperwork to stay in this country,” she said. “It is not fair that they are treating everybody as equal as criminals and without recognizing that criminals, murderers, all of these criminals can be [anyone] — it doesn’t matter the race.”

Gov. Sarah Huckabee Sanders tied Arkansas immigration policy to Trump when she announced legislation two weeks ago to impose harsher penalties on undocumented migrants who commit crimes in the state. 
“The Defense Against Criminal Illegals Act makes it clear: Arkansas will not tolerate violent, criminal illegals and will do our part to help the Trump administration keep our citizens safe,” Sanders said during a March 17 press conference. 
The Senate Judiciary Committee approved Senate Bill 426 Monday morning, but an amendment in the afternoon means the bill will need to be reheard by the committee.
Licolli told reporters Monday that when Sanders says it’s her job to protect citizens, she’s only referring to the white community. 
“We are also citizens, we are also humans,” Licolli said. “And she’s been enjoying the chicken that these immigrants are producing, so I wonder what she’s going to do with her chicken if they are targeting the immigrants. She enjoys the benefits from the labor of these immigrants, so it’s a hypocrisy and it’s very racist that she is condemning all of these people for feeding her family.”
Springdale is home to Tyson Foods, one the world’s largest food companies, and Licolli said poultry companies, like Tyson, should speak out for immigrants because they benefit from their labor. In addition to calling for better working conditions and for immigrants’ humanity to be respected, Licolli said they also deserve a path to citizenship for all they’ve done to support the economy. 
Protestors urge Arkansas’ Tyson to commit to child labor, worker safety protections

Vladimir Rivera Lopez, District 4 Justice of the Peace for the Washington County Quorum Court, said he became really interested in workers rights after reading Life and Death of the American Worker, a book by Alice Driver that shares the challenges faced by immigrant workers at Tyson.
Rivera Lopez, a Springdale Democrat that won his first-ever election by 10 votes in November, said that he will attend “any event that affirms the dignity of someone else in my community.”
“It’s very easy to exploit people who can’t vote, who don’t have that opportunity to represent themselves come November, but that doesn’t mean that these people don’t exist,” he said.
Rivera Lopez joined dozens of Northwest Arkansas residents at Monday’s rally, including Angela Hickman of Bella Vista, who decided to spend her day off marching to city hall dressed as Lady Liberty alongside her boyfriend and dog. 
Hickman said she’s taking every opportunity “to show support and fight back” because there’s a lot wrong with what’s happening in the country. 
“Letting our people that represent us know that we are not okay with what’s going on,” she said. “And Trump and [Elon] Musk need to not be where they are. They’re doing a lot of damage, and I can’t just sit idly by.”
Even when policies don’t directly affect her, Hickman, who teared up during her explanation, said that one day “it could be me.”
“I have children, they need a future, and I have to make that happen for them,” she said. “My grandmother did it, my mom did it, my aunt, it’s in the family all the way back to the Civil Rights Movement and everything in between. My grandmother can’t be here to do it, she is no longer with us, so I’m doing it for her.”

As a part of the collaboration, St. Luke’s emergency departments in Boise, Meridian, Mountain Home and McCall have more than 20 Naloxone distribution containers, or “barney boxes,” stocked with free overdose prevention supplies in their lobby entrance areas. 
The boxes contain free naloxone kits and are paid for with opioid settlement funds. The boxes can help save lives. Naloxone (Narcan) is a safe, effective, over-the-counter medication that reverses the effects of an opioid overdose. 
“Naloxone is designed to be easy for anyone to administer, even without medical training,” Courtney Boyce, the health district’s substance use and behavioral health program manager, said in a press release. “The nasal spray is very straightforward to use. Instructions are included on the naloxone box.”
Training is also available upon request, Boyce said. 
Ten boxes were placed in 2024, another 10 this year. Central District Health is aiming for 10 more in 2026, according to the press release. Participating agencies that house the boxes may choose to stock xylazine testing strips, fentanyl testing strips, rescue breath shields and other free items. 
Those interested in ordering a naloxone distribution box or interested in exploring other overdose prevention and rescue supplies provided by the health district can visit the district’s storefront. Supplies come with free shipping for Ada, Boise, Elmore, or Valley counties. Barney Box locations can be found here.

(Photo: Getty Images)Tennessee lawmakers are headed for a showdown over hemp legislation that, under a Senate version, could heavily restrict products containing intoxicating derivatives.
Both measures are to be considered Tuesday in House and Senate finance committees and could impact a regulated industry that nets the state tens of millions in revenue from an estimated $280 million to $560 million in yearly sales.
The biggest difference in the bills lies with THCA, a derivative that delivers a high similar to marijuana once it is heated or burned. The House version would allow THCA to continue to be sold in some stores while the Senate bill would restrict it.
Clint Palmer, a hemp industry attorney, said Tennessee could become the first state in the nation to regulate the THCA market, a move generally supported by the industry because it would enable sales to continue. 
Both versions of the bill would move the policing of hemp-derived products under the Alcoholic Beverage Commission from the Department of Agriculture and enact a wholesale tax of one cent per milligram on hemp products.
Originally, both versions would have prohibited THCA, but an amendment placed on the House bill was designed to keep hemp farmers from losing their businesses. 
Hemp industry fears slate of restrictive bills could gut industry

House Majority Leader William Lamberth, sponsor of the House version, confirmed Monday the biggest sticking point between the two versions is the level of delta-9 THC that would be allowed in products.
Hemp is distinguished from marijuana based on the concentration of a compound called delta-9 THC. Cannabis with less than 0.3% delta-9 THC is defined as legal hemp in Tennessee as well as federally. Cannabis with greater concentrations is classified as marijuana and is illegal to grow, sell or possess in the state.
Sen. Richard Briggs, sponsor of the Senate version, amended the bill late last week, to ensure the measure wouldn’t hurt the state financially. It’s expected to maintain a surplus of up to $14 million from fees and taxes on growers, wholesalers and sellers, he said.
Briggs, a Knoxville Republican, said the bill would ban marijuana but not hemp. He bases his view on a 2024 letter from the U.S. Department of Justice stating the Controlled Substances Act classifies THCA as “controlled.” Yet the act excludes hemp from the definition of marijuana as long as it has a THC concentration of no more than 0.3%.
“We’re not interested in recreational marijuana,” Briggs said.
If both measures move through their respective chambers unchanged, the bills could be resolved with a conference committee to work out differences as the legislature adjourns for the year.
The matter remains tied up in litigation after the state required new testing of hemp products last year for delta-9 THC. The Tennessee Growers Coalition and the Tennessee Healthy Alternatives Associations said rules set to take effect in late December 2024 amounted to state “overreach” that would lead to a ban on products.
Dispute also centers on a move by the liquor store industry to take over most of THC drink sales from convenience and grocery stores.
Those stores are trying to stay in business as the law allows, said Rob Ikard of the Tennessee Grocers and Convenience Store Association.
“Grocery stores and convenience stores who are already in this business under the current law do a really good job of age enforcement and regulation,” Ikard said.
Briggs said Monday he believes too many products on store shelves contain higher THC levels than the law allows. He believes the Alcoholic Beverage Commission should get involved in regulating the industry, and he added that the Tennessee Bureau of Investigation could play a role in enforcement.

(Michael Achterling/North Dakota Monitor)Bishops from the Catholic dioceses of Bismarck and Fargo signed a joint letter Sunday urging parishioners across the state to contact their legislators and advocate for Education Savings Accounts.
Senate Bill 2400 and House Bill 1540 both passed their respective chambers during the first half of the legislative session and would allocate state tax dollars to student Education Savings Accounts that could be spent on a variety of services, including paying tuition for private schools.
The letter, signed by Bishop David Kagan of Bismarck and Bishop John Folda of Fargo, states the church teaches that parents are the primary educators for their children and they should have the freedom and resources to choose the best educational setting for their kids.
“They do not divert money from public schools, do not hurt rural schools and would be a great help to many families across the state of North Dakota,” the letter stated.
Bills look to expand North Dakota student opportunities through savings accounts

The letter was read from the pulpit at Catholic churches across the state, said David Tamisiea, executive director of the North Dakota Catholic Conference. 
“It should’ve been read by everybody,” Tamisiea said.
He said it is the job of bishops as teachers of the faith to educate the faithful.
“People of faith have a voice to be heard in the public sphere,” Tamisiea said. “It’s OK for our faith leaders to encourage the people to exercise that voice and that’s what they are doing.”
He also said public-private partnerships are a staple of state government in North Dakota and the education system should not be any different.
“There are all kinds of public-private partnerships where we use public funds to pay private organizations to carry out important tasks,” Tamisiea said.
The Catholic dioceses of Fargo and Bismarck encompass about 220 churches across North Dakota, according to their websites. The state also has more than 35 private Catholic schools, including pre-K.
Nick Archuleta, president of North Dakota United, which represents public school educators and opposes the bills, said the call to action by the Catholic diocese was not unexpected.
“What we are preparing for is to defeat these bills in each of the two chambers,” Archuleta said. “We’ve never been a fan of using public dollars to support private school tuition and we’re not going to start now.”
He added North Dakota United conducted polling in December that showed 68% of respondents were somewhat or strongly opposed to using tax dollars to pay for private tuition.
Both bills are scheduled for committee work on Tuesday in the Senate and House Education Committees, which are expected to make recommendations in the coming days.

In its first abortion case since President Donald Trump’s reelection, the Supreme Court will hear arguments next week about whether states can bar Planned Parenthood from receiving Medicaid funds — which could further the administration’s goal of “defunding” the nation’s largest family planning provider.
Medina v. Planned Parenthood South Atlantic concerns an order from South Carolina Gov. Henry McMaster, who in 2018 said any clinic that provided abortions could not participate in the state’s Medicaid program. Lower courts have blocked McMaster’s order from taking effect. But if implemented, the state policy could seriously undercut South Carolinians’ access to reproductive health care and create a template for other states to emulate.
Medicaid, the health insurance program for low-income Americans disproportionately serves Black and Latinx people. It does not cover abortions in most states, including in South Carolina, where just under 60% of beneficiaries are not White. Federal law dictates that people who receive Medicaid — more than a million in South Carolina, and about 400,000 of whom are women between the ages of 15 and 44 — are allowed to use it at any qualified health care provider that accepts the insurance plan.

This report was first published by The 19th. The Illuminator is a founding member of The 19th News Network.

Cutting Planned Parenthood from Medicaid could have big impacts: Planned Parenthood clinics provide other forms of medical care, such as testing for sexually transmitted infections, cancer screenings and birth control services, all of which Medicaid is supposed to cover. Medicaid is the most common source of insurance for patients who seek health care at Planned Parenthood clinics. Without Medicaid reimbursement, the clinics — which operate with thin financial margins — would likely either have to turn patients away or charge them.
The oral arguments — in which the federal government has joined the case as a friend of the court to argue alongside the state in defense of the policy — in this case come at a complex moment for the future of reproductive health care more broadly. Backed by anti-abortion activists, Trump has pushed an agenda of ending federal funding for Planned Parenthood, the vast majority of which comes from Medicaid.
Abortion opponents have called this policy “defunding,” even though it would not affect private money given to Planned Parenthood, and it would cut revenue sources that don’t actually pay for abortion. Still, it could inject new financial instability for Planned Parenthood and other similar health centers.
A report this week from The Wall Street Journal suggested that the Trump administration is considering freezing all funding to Title X, another federal program that supports family planning clinics services for low-income people. Planned Parenthood is the largest single Title X provider.
With the exception of medical emergencies, health facilities aren’t required to accept Medicaid, meaning that people covered through the program can struggle to find health care providers who take their insurance.
Research from George Washington University suggests that almost 40% of all counties in South Carolina are “contraceptive deserts” where there aren’t enough providers to serve all people in need.
But the impact would likely extend even beyond areas where reproductive health care is hard to attain, denying people in all parts of the country the right to choose who provides an intimate, essential form of health care, said Sara Rosenbaum, a professor emerita of health law and policy at George Washington University who co-authored a brief arguing that the Supreme Court should reject South Carolina’s policy.
“I don’t care if you’re in rural South Carolina or downtown St. Louis, Missouri. There are certain services where if it’s a good quality provider, and this is the provider you prefer, it’s very important to be able to see a trusted provider,” she said.
Public health professionals have warned that upholding South Carolina’s policy could open the door to states discriminating against other qualified medical providers, deciding arbitrarily that patients cannot use their Medicaid coverage at certain health clinics. That could include refusing to let Medicaid cover a certain home care provider because of its stance on unionization, Rosenbaum suggested, or because of employees participating in protests.
And it could influence other states with anti-abortion government leaders. Already, three other states — Arkansas, Missouri and Texas — are enforcing laws that disqualify Planned Parenthood from participating in Medicaid, even though abortion is illegal in two of those.
“If the Supreme Court decides that Medicaid recipients cannot fight back in court when the South Carolina Department of Health and Human Services prevents them from freely choosing their health care provider, the effects could ripple far beyond South Carolina,” said Amy Friedrich-Karnik, director of federal policy for the Guttmacher Institute, which supports abortion rights but whose research is cited across the political spectrum.
A 2015 analysis from the Congressional Budget Office estimated that eliminating all federal funding for Planned Parenthood would mean fewer Americans receiving family planning care — and more people having unplanned pregnancies — even if other health care providers tried to step in. The government analysis, conducted before the overturning of Roe v. Wade allowed states to ban abortion, found that eliminating federal funding would increase federal spending by $130 million over nine years.
“If you pull back Medicaid funding… then they become nonviable, which is the whole point,” Rosenbaum said. “The public health effects of all this are horrendous.”

AARP West Virginia backs this bill, estimating that it could help 250,000 caregivers who are helping family members in the state. 
But as Crossover Day is Wednesday — the day legislation must move out of their chamber of origin — the tax credit bill sits parked in the Senate Finance Committee. 
“Family caregivers often face significant out-of-pocket expenses, averaging over $7,200 annually, to ensure their loved ones receive the necessary care,” said Gaylene Miller, AARP West Virginia state director. “A caregiver tax credit would provide significant financial relief to family caregivers, promoting independence and safety for loved ones, and encouraging more individuals to take on caregiving roles.”
The measure, Senate Bill 697, is known as the “Caregiver Tax Credit Act.” It would establish a nonrefundable tax credit with a maximum of $2,000 for eligible family members 18 years of age and older for eligible expenditures incurred in their caregiving duties.
A fiscal note by the state Tax and Revenue Department estimates that the proposed legislation would result in a loss of General Revenue funds of $160 million to $260 million per year beginning in fiscal year 2028.
  Sen. Laura Wakim Chapman, R-Ohio
“While this tax credit will cost the state initially, I believe the savings will more than be made up for it because Medicaid will not have to pay for nursing home residential care,” said Sen. Laura Wakim Chapman, R-Ohio, who sponsored the bill. “Beyond the savings, our elderly deserve to remain in their homes surrounded by their loved ones for as long as possible.”
  Sen. Mike Woelfel, D-Cabell
Representatives from AARP West Virginia say their research shows 84% of Republican, Democratic and independent voters support a tax credit for caregivers.  
“The caregiver tax credit bill is a righteous investment in keeping disabled or elderly West Virginians out of institutional care,” said Sen. Mike Woelfel, D-Cabell, a co-sponsor of the measure. “This is the most ‘West Virginia’ bill I have seen in 11 sessions. We are our brothers’ keepers.”
The Senate Health Committee advanced the legislation March 19, sending the measure to the finance committee.
Senate Finance Chairman Jason Barrett was unavailable to comment for this story. 
U.S. Sen. Shelley Moore Capito, R-W.Va., has introduced a bill on the federal level — the Credit for Caring Act — aimed at providing financial relief for family caregivers. The bipartisan legislation would offer a tax credit of up to $5,000 for eligible working family caregivers to help offset caregiving expenses.

That&#8217;s a finding in a report released last week by the Washington-based political reform group Issue One. And, in the context of the report, [&#8230;]","U.S. Rep. Brett Guthrie of Kentucky, chairman of the House Energy and Commerce Committee, talks with reporters after a meeting of the House Republican Conference in the U.S. Capitol Feb, 5. 2025. (Tom Williams/CQ-Roll Call, Inc via Getty Images)Among the powerful committee leaders of the U.S. House of Representatives, no one ships nearly as much campaign money to his party’s political caucus as Kentucky’s 2nd District Congressman Brett Guthrie.
That’s a finding in a report released last week by the Washington-based political reform group Issue One. And, in the context of the report, it’s not a flattering distinction.
The report is the latest of five that Issue One has released since 2017 that decry a system — employed by both parties — in which House members find themselves under “relentless fundraising pressure” to raise money for their party caucus committee if they want to be appointed to powerful and prestigious committees.
“A little-known fact about members of Congress is that they must constantly raise money not just for their own reelection bids but to help their respective political parties accumulate power,” the report says. “Both the Democratic and Republican parties lean on their most powerful legislators to boost their political war chests, under something called the ‘party dues’ system.” 
This forces members to devote vast amounts of time to fundraising — time sometimes spent pleading for money from wealthy interests that lobby Congress and appear before congressional committees, the report says.
The pressure comes from the Republican and Democratic leaders who control committee assignments of their members.
Last December Republican leaders of the U.S. House picked Guthrie to chair the important Committee on Energy and Commerce, the oldest continuous standing committee in the House and one with broad jurisdiction over the country’s health care, energy and environmental policies, telecommunications and technology innovation, and consumer safety.
  Issue One examined the contributions of 11 top Republicans and Democrats on four powerful House committees to their party’s caucus’ political fund since Jan. 1, 2023. Rep. Brett Guthrie topped the list, transferring $2.5 million from his campaign committee to the National Republican Congressional Committee during the period. (Source: Issue One analysis of Federal Elections Commission data)
GOP leaders have handed Guthrie and his committee a big assignment: cut $880 billion in spending, much of which will have to come from Medicaid, the federal-state program that pays for about 72 million Americans’ health care, including almost 1 in 3 Kentuckians. The savings are needed to reduce the federal budget by $2 trillion as Republicans seek to renew and make permanent $4.5 trillion in tax cuts from the first Trump administration. 
Issue One examined the contributions of top Republicans and Democrats on four powerful committees of the House since Jan. 1, 2023. The report found that about $1 of every $6 spent by the campaign committees of these 11 key committee leaders (seven Republicans, four Democrats) was in contributions to the party caucus’ political fund. (For Democrats, the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee or DCCC; for Republicans, the National Republican Congressional Committee, or NRCC.)
Among the 11 committee leaders, the report shows Guthrie gave by far the most, transferring $2.5 million from his campaign committee to the NRCC during the period. That amounted to a bit more than half of all of the spending by Guthrie’s committee during the period. (None of the other 10 committee leaders whose campaign finances were examined transferred more than $1.5 million or more than 39% of their total spending during the period to their caucus political fund.)
  More than half of Guthrie’s campaign expenditures during the two-year period were to the National Republican Campaign Committee. (Source: Issue One from analysis of Federal Elections Commission data)
Guthrie’s Washington office referred questions from Kentucky Lantern last week to a Guthrie campaign spokeswoman who did not reply to an email from Kentucky Lantern.
Issue One reported that in his recent bid for chairmanship of Energy and Commerce, Guthrie was opposed by U.S. Rep. Bob Latta, an Ohio Republican. Online records of the Federal Election Commission show Latta’s campaign committee transferred nearly $1.3 million to the NRCC in 2023-24. That’s a large amount, but still far less than the $2.5 million transferred by Guthrie’s campaign committee during the same period.
“Fundraising prowess is one criteria that party leaders consider when deciding whom to elevate into important leadership roles … ,” said Michael Beckel, one of the authors of the Issue One report. “Rep. Guthrie’s massive fundraising for the NRCC ahead of the 2024 election certainly didn’t hurt him as he made a bid to become the next chairman of the coveted House Energy and Commerce Committee.”
Punchbowl News reported soon after last November’s elections that Guthrie appeared to be the favorite over Latta. While Latta had an advantage in experience, Punchbowl News reported Guthrie “leads the fundraising race this year by leaps and bounds.”
‘Profound conflicts of interest’
  Republican Rep. Thomas Massie, of Kentucky’s 4th Congressional District, says the party dues system is “extortion and should be illegal.” (Andrew Harnik/Getty Images)
In 2016 USA Today reported that the process involves legislative leaders setting quotas for members. “Lawmakers are supposed to dip into their own reelection accounts to meet these fundraising quotas,” USA Today reported. “Those who make — or exceed — their dues are considered ‘team players,’ a label that lifts their chances of landing plum committee assignments.”
That same USA Today report said another Kentucky Republican, U.S. Rep. Thomas Massie, refused to pay his dues. “They told us right off the bat as soon as we get here, ‘These committees all have prices and don’t pick an expensive one if you can’t make the payments,” Massie said. “That’s part of orientation.”
On Monday, Massie, in response to questions emailed him by Kentucky Lantern, said, “My opinion of the dues system is still the same: it’s extortion and should be illegal.”
As for how his refusal to participate in the system has affected his committee assignments, Massie said, “I’ve been able to maintain committee assignments to B and C committees without giving to the NRCC, but participation on an A committee is understood to be off the table, so I’ve never sought an A committee.”
Issue One CEO Nick Penniman said in last week’s report, “It’s a betrayal of public trust for legislative leaders in Congress to be constantly worried about fundraising and regularly soliciting wealthy and well-connected donors who have business before their committees. These fundraising demands lead to profound conflicts of interest.”
Guthrie, of Bowling Green, is a former state senator who first won election to Congress in 2008 by beating Democrat David Boswell in a competitive election for the right to succeed retiring Republican Congressman Ron Lewis.
Since then Guthrie has never been seriously threatened in eight reelections. This gives him the luxury of being able to transfer his campaign funds to the NRCC. Last November he won reelection with 73.1% of the vote despite transferring more than half of his campaign war chest during the two-year election cycle to the NRCC.
Beckel of Issue One described the organization as bipartisan and called it “the leading cross-partisan political reform group in Washington, D.C.”
“We unite Republicans, Democrats, and independents in the movement to fix our broken political system and build a democracy that works for everyone,” he said. “We are fiercely bipartisan, working with current and former members of Congress from both sides of the aisle.”",https://kentuckylantern.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/gettyimages-2197247907-594x594-1.jpg,,,2025-04-01 06:00:15.938269

(LRC Public Information)FRANKFORT — A former Democratic state lawmaker is no longer sitting on a powerful commission regulating utilities in Kentucky after the GOP-controlled Kentucky Senate took no action to confirm him before the 2025 regular session ended Friday. 
  John Will Stacy
Democratic Kentucky Gov. Andy Beshear in September appointed John Will Stacy of West Liberty, a state representative from 1993 to 2015 who later served as the Morgan County judge-executive, to the three-member Kentucky Public Service Commission (PSC). 
Stacy sat on the commission and heard requests from utilities in the months after his appointment but needed confirmation by the Kentucky Senate to continue serving through the end of his term in 2028. No resolution to confirm Stacy had been introduced, confirmation hearing scheduled or vote taken on his appointment by the time lawmakers adjourned Friday.  
Kentucky Senate President Robert Stivers, R-Mancester, told reporters Friday the reasons for not confirming Stacy included that the former lawmaker was drawing a pension from his previous time in government on top of a six-figure salary PSC commissioners make. 
Stivers also said he knew of Stacy’s business interests and local and government experience, but he considered Stacy to be unqualified for the role given the complexity of topics dealt with by the PSC.
“What is his background in energy?” Stivers said. “This is a highly technical field.”
The Republican Senate leader said he hoped Beshear would appoint a new PSC member who has experience in a range of utilities from electricity to drinking water given the technical nature of overseeing the “delivery of cheap, dispatchable energy to the consumer.” 
But the Senate is making it harder to recruit PSC candidates, Beshear spokesperson Crystal Staley told the Lantern on Monday.
“This is now the third Public Service Commissioner that the General Assembly has not confirmed. Each has been qualified, and the failure to confirm them has drastically reduced interest in the positions. The Senate continues to create new structures or take actions to pressure the commission on the outcome of or the reopening of cases.”
The PSC regulates the rates and services of more than 1,100 utilities, from large investor-owned electric providers such as Louisville Gas and Electric and Kentucky Utilities to small water districts providing drinking water to rural communities. 
The legislature last year created an 18-member commission, separate from the PSC, charged with examining and making recommendations on requests from utilities to retire fossil fuel-fired power plants. In 2023, the legislature passed a law making it harder for utilities to retire coal-fired power plants.
Stacy’s removal leaves two commissioners on the three-member board, PSC chair Angie Hatton and Mary Pat Regan.

(Christopher Shea/Rhode Island Current)The push to clear the air inside Rhode Island’s two casinos won’t ignite at the shareholder level this year.
Enough Bally’s Corporation shareholders had backed a proposal to study a smoking ban from Michigan-based Trinity Health at the company’s 2024 annual meeting to qualify for resubmission at this year’s gathering tentatively scheduled for May 15. But Cathy Rowan, Trinity’s director of socially responsible investments, told Rhode Island Current that the nonprofit chose not to refile. 
She attributed the decision to last year’s buyout of Bally’s by the New York hedge fund owned by Soo Kim, the Providence-based casino giant’s largest shareholder and chairman of its Board of Directors.
Asked how the new structure would impact a new proposal to study a potential smoking ban, Rowan said it would “be difficult to achieve a vote result similar to what the resolution received last year.”
Trinity will still submit shareholder resolutions to go smoke-free with Boyd Gaming, Caesars Entertainment, Wynn Resorts and Penn Entertainment. 
Lauren Westerfield, a spokesperson for Bally’s corporate office, acknowledged a request for comment with an email saying that the company plans to release a proxy statement after April 4.
That leaves advocates’ ongoing battle to end the loophole that exempts the state’s two casinos from an indoor smoking ban solely with the General Assembly.
“We’ve always taken the position that this was going to take a legislative fix,” Rhode Island AFL-CIO president Patrick Crowley said in an interview. “And we’re trying to let as many legislators know where we stand.”
Crowley is also betting big that public opinion will make the difference. The AFL-CIO in February released a poll that found nearly 7 in 10 survey respondents “strongly” or “somewhat” supported a smoking ban at the state’s two casinos.
And momentum appears to be growing in the Rhode Island House of Representatives, where legislation filed by Rep. Teresa Tanzi, a South Kingstown Democrat, has been co-sponsored by Speaker K. Joseph Shekarchi.
“I’m glad our legislature seems to be moving in the right direction,” Tanzi said in an interview. “I do believe that this will in fact pass on the House side this year.” 
Matt Dunham, president of Providence-based Table Game Dealers Laborers Local 711, said support in the House was always going to be a given after Shekarchi allowed a symbolic committee vote at the end of last year’s legislative session.
“It’s always come down to the Senate,” he said. “They’ve always been the ones we couldn’t get.”
Companion legislation sponsored by Sen. V. Susan Sosnowski, a South Kingstown Democrat, was initially referred to the Senate Committee on Finance but has since been transferred to the chamber’s Committee on Labor and Gaming, which is chaired by Sen. Frank Ciccone, a Providence Democrat who has been a staunch opponent against banning smoking.
Ciccone said in a recent interview that he met with union leaders and anti-smoking advocates on Feb. 26 to try and come up with a compromise to expand existing non-smoking areas in the casinos.
“We’re still working on it,” Ciccone said.
Crowley called the meeting “cordial.”
“And we agreed to continue talking and see where this goes over the next couple of weeks and months of the session,” Crowley said.
Ciccone said he understands advocates’ calls to end Bally’s exemption from the state’s indoor smoking ban, but argued that allowing smoking gives Rhode Island’s casinos a competitive edge over neighboring states with more dining and shopping options.
“If you go to Lincoln, why are the majority of the cars in the parking lot from out of state?” he said. “Is it because they like us? Or do they come to us because they smoke?”
Ciccone said a smoking ban could cut Bally’s bottom line by upward of 10%, which would result in 126 layoffs in Lincoln and Tiverton — projections company spokesperson Patti Doyle said were accurate.
“We intend to present information about the revenue and jobs impact of a potential smoking ban at our two Rhode Island venues when we testify on legislation introduced to do just that,” Doyle said in an emailed statement.
Tanzi and Susnowski’s bills have yet to be scheduled for a hearing. Tanzi said she expects her bill to go before the House Committee on Finance after legislators wrap up their ongoing budget hearings.
Dunham said he doesn’t believe the company’s argument over job cuts is valid.
“They run a barebones operation already,” he said. “The problem I see in the casino is they don’t hire enough.”
Bally’s has 40 job postings for its Lincoln casino and 18 at its Tiverton location as of Monday, according to its website.
As state lawmakers prepare for debate to return to Smith Hill, Dunham said the union plans to hold rallies and encourage workers and advocates to write to their legislators.
“We’re going to do the same thing we’ve always been doing,” he said.

Local food purchasing programs are some of the latest government programs summarily guillotined by the administration. These programs, managed by the U.S. Department of Agriculture via the Local Food Purchase Assistance Cooperative Agreement and the Local Food for Schools & Child Care Agreement Program, would have appropriated $13.1 million to provide local food to food banks, students and food insecure populations. By supporting Colorado farmers and ranchers, local food procurement programs also promised to strengthen regional food systems.
The local food purchasing programs were true win-win initiatives for Colorado’s consumers and producers. From Pueblo to the Western Slope, food banks, schools, day cares, churches and veteran service centers used USDA dollars to buy local produce, beef, dairy, grains and other agricultural products from Colorado farms, ranches, dairies and more. Between May 2022 and June 2024, 220 food producers earned $6.7 million from local food purchasing programs. More than a million dollars funneled into the pockets of Western Slope farmers.
SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
For producers participating in the programs, the short-term outcomes were financial stability, new partnerships with large institutions, and the expansion of business operations. For the entire state, the long-term outcome could have been a thriving regional food system — so that in time, Coloradans could purchase local, sustainable, and highly nutritious food not just at farmer’s markets, but from grocery stores and restaurants.
Most of the food in Colorado grocery stores is produced and processed out of state or internationally then shipped to various warehouses across North America before being shelved in King Soopers, Trader Joe’s or elsewhere. This globalized and opaque system obscures food production from consumers, facilitating the concealment of environmental and humanitarian issues in American food supply chains (such as excessive pesticide use, child labor, deforestation). Regional food systems, or systems in which food is produced, processed and consumed all within the same region, offer an alternative paradigm for feeding Coloradans. Regional food systems reduce food waste, increase farmers’ profit margins, generate local jobs, and strengthen local economies. And by supporting small- and mid-sized farmers growing diverse crops, regional food systems protect biodiversity, improve soil quality, and reduce energy use.
The local food purchasing programs accomplished the non-controversial goals of stimulating local economies and feeding people in need — so what instigated the Trump administration’s ire?
Because the administration offered no explanation, the answer may only be conjectured: perhaps because these programs emphasize supporting socially disadvantaged food producers, and almost certainly because the Trump administration is determined to dismantle Biden-era initiatives, regardless of their merit. And on the surface, cutting local food purchasing programs aligns with the Trump administration’s efforts to rein in unnecessary spending (a subjective assessment) in the name of government efficiency.
Yet, these claims of government efficiency ring especially hollow and hypocritical considering that ongoing inefficient government spending is the reason these programs are necessary in the first place — $478 billion of subsidies benefitted the nation’s largest and wealthiest farms between 2015 and 2022, creating an uneven playing field for the country’s small- and mid-sized food producers. The approximately $1 billion budget for local food purchasing programs is a drop in the bucket compared to the subsidies lavished on farmers that don’t even grow food for people. Instead they farm corn, soy and other commodity crops to create ethanol, livestock feed, and other products.
Regardless of the justification and injustice driving the termination of the USDA’s local food purchasing programs, they leave a void that needs filling. The benefits of strong regional food systems are too great to neglect, and the programs were too successful to abandon. The state of Colorado must step up to support farmers, ranchers and food insecure people. And because the state is currently struggling with a $1 billion budget deficit, additional government spending requires more state income. To support regional food systems and food security, state legislators should look into creating an enterprise, or otherwise refer a small excise tax on soft drinks to the ballot for Coloradans to vote on.
Boulder, which adopted a soft drink excise tax in 2016, demonstrates the profitably of such taxes — so far, it has generated $29 million for health-related programs. If expanded throughout the entire state, an excise tax on soft drinks could provide a huge sum to fund regional food systems and other state priorities, like healthy meals for all public schools. According to an online calculator developed by the University of Connecticut Center for Food Policy and Health, a $0.02/ounce excise tax on soft drinks in Colorado would have generated between $227 million and $287 million in 2023 (depending on the tax pass through rate).
Colorado leaders face a difficult task: maintaining Coloradan’s quality of life and rights, as well as the state’s environmental and social prerogatives despite opposition at the federal level. An arsenal of state policies is necessary to combat perverse federal policy decisions, and policies to resuscitate local food purchasing programs should be a top priority — for the sake of food insecure Coloradans, local food producers, and the state’s regional food systems.

Josh Stein signs a hurricane recovery package surrounded by a bipartisan group of state lawmakers. The author says Stein would meet feverish conservative resistance if he attempted to issue budget cutting edicts similar to those handed down by President Donald Trump. (Photo: Office of the Governor)The spectacle of politicians preaching one thing and doing another, and of criticizing others for action that they too might have taken in similar circumstances, is nothing particularly new. Sometimes, it’s just a reflection of the fact that it’s a lot easier to be an outsider in opposition than it is to be on the inside trying to govern. Other times, it’s a function of the old adage, “success has a thousand fathers and defeat is an orphan.”
That said, the hypocritical double standards at work on the modern political right these days in the era of Donald Trump are often enough to make your head spin.
Consider the recent “Signalgate” scandal in which Trump’s Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth and National Security Advisor Mike Waltz included journalist Jeffrey Goldberg of The Atlantic in a text chain that also included Director of National Intelligence Chief Tulsi Gabbard and Vice President JD Vance as they discussed a planned military operation.
As 82nd Airborne veteran Scott Peoples pointed out in a recent op-ed for NC Newsline, under many circumstances, soldiers guilty of divulging such sensitive operational plans could expect a dishonorable discharge and possible imprisonment. Unfortunately, the sound one hears thus far in response to the Trump team’s remarkable foul-up in most conservative circles is that of crickets chirping.
One can only imagine the deafening roar of complaints we’d be hearing from Fox News shouters and Republican politicians right now if it had been members of a Kamala Harris administration that had committed such an outrageous breach of national security. Demands to fire the responsible officials would be at a fever pitch, and U.S. House Republicans would probably already be scheduling presidential impeachment hearings.
And the same hypocrisy would undoubtedly play out closer to home as well. Consider the following scenario.
As has been well-documented in recent weeks, Trump, with the help of his unelected immigrant billionaire sidekick Elon Musk, has moved unilaterally to effect a massive and chaotic bloodletting of the federal government. From the attempted elimination of the U.S. Department of Education to the evisceration of several other key departments — including, amazingly enough, the National Weather Service and the Department of Veterans Affairs — Trump and Musk have moved, without legislative authorization, to end or dramatically reduce funding for a host of programs and initiatives that do not reflect their views and values.
But, of course, as is the case with the U.S. government and Trump, the state of North Carolina has long funded statewide and local programs and initiatives opposed by its current chief executive, Gov. Josh Stein.
Likely topping the list: the state’s massive private school voucher program. North Carolina Republican lawmakers have been funneling billions of public dollars to unaccountable and discriminatory private schools for years, even as they have consistently refused to adequately fund traditional public schools.
Or consider the legislature’s repeated allocation of millions of dollars to the black hole that is the state’s network of so-called “crisis pregnancy centers” — completely unaccountable propaganda shops that often masquerade as health providers and generally exist to promote and funnel money to anti-abortion advocacy.
Or how about any number of newly funded programs bestowed by GOP lawmakers on Republican Council of State members like, say, Agriculture Commissioner Steve Troxler?
Just imagine if Stein — who controls the state budget office, after all — tried to follow Trump’s example by issuing executive orders directing administration officials to simply cancel government programs he disliked.
Funding for school vouchers and crisis pregnancy centers: Gone. New employees at Council of State departments led by Republicans: Fired.
Suffice it so to say that Republican lawmakers and right-wing lobby groups loyal to Trump would be apoplectic.
Moves that, when taken by Dear Leader Trump, have been met with full-throated huzzahs (see, for example, North Carolina Fifth District Congresswoman Rep. Virginia Foxx’s recent embarrassing, kneejerk endorsement of Trump’s destructive and illegal scheme to eliminate the Department of Education), would attract guttural screams of outrage.
School privatization and anti-abortion groups would angrily accuse Stein of being a dictator out to steal their freedoms.
Meanwhile, GOP legislative leaders like Senate President Pro Tem Phil Berger and House Speaker Destin Hall would beat a path from the Legislative Building over to Berger’s son and the other Republican denizens of the state Supreme Court building faster than you can say “legislative rubber stamp.”
Of course, the big and critical difference in such a scenario from the current situation at the national level is that Gov. Stein would never take such actions. Unlike both Trump and Musk, Stein is a smart and skilled attorney and an honest and responsible leader who actually believes in constitutional government and the rule of law. While he may disagree with numerous programs funded by the state government he leads, he understands his obligation to abide by the rules and that there are limits to his power.
Would that Trump and the hypocritical political puppets he controls were of the same admirable character.",https://ncnewsline.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Gov.-Stein-signs-relief-bill-1024x683.jpeg,,,2025-04-01 06:00:15.938269

Mitch McConnell in a way that reminds people of what Judas did to Jesus for 30 pieces of silver.
Over the years, McConnell’s hard work almost single-handedly built the Republican Party of Kentucky into the state’s majority party. McConnell made it possible 15 years ago for a former government lawyer like Barr to even dream of running for Congress in Central Kentucky.  
Without McConnell, there would be no Congressman Barr, and for years Barr followed McConnell’s lead in voting to protect Social Security, veteran, and a strong military.  Sadly, Barr has gone weak and fainted into the arms of multi-billionaire government contractor Elon Musk.
As with Judas, there’s a reason for Barr’s radical reversal: he’s doing it for Elon’s money. If money is the root of all evil, Musk’s campaign contributions are certainly at the heart of Barr’s treachery toward McConnell.
Barr’s in frantic pursuit of McConnell’s Senate seat, so he’s ditching his long-time ally and desperately chasing Elon. In years to come, Barr’s lust for Musk’s money and his betrayal of McConnell will be remembered as one of the most despicable double crosses in Kentucky political history.

McConnell’s a constitutional conservative, and as the nation’s founders intended, he’s always stood up for the budget-making power of Congress, the branch of government closest to the people.  
In contrast, and for Elon’s money, Barr is cheerleading for Musk, an unelected rich guy who’s plundering tax dollars that were appropriated by law (with Barr’s votes) and trying to pull the plug on Social Security so it can be handed over to Wall Street bankers. 
Elon calls Social Security “the biggest Ponzi scheme of all time” and Barr smiles and says: “Thank you sir, may I have another.” 
Musk is a South African native who dumped about $300 million into last year’s presidential campaign. That money bought him a big government job, and with Barr’s approval, Elon is using his position to decimate programs that support Kentucky veterans and the military, Social Security, Medicare, national parks, public schools, cancer research, and disaster aid for flood victims.  Musk can also use his position to steer billions of taxpayer dollars to his private businesses.
  U.S. Sen. Rand Paul (Photo by Eric Thayer/Getty Images)
For Elon’s money, and another slap in McConnell’s face, Barr is supporting tariffs that amount to a national sales tax. Tariffs will increase inflation, and cause chaos in the stock market and the retirement accounts of millions of Americans.
Both McConnell and Sen. Rand Paul are telling Barr — in Paul’s words — “Tariffs are simply taxes. Conservatives once united against new taxes. Taxing trade will mean less trade and higher prices.”
Contrary to Barr’s new position on tariffs, McConnell explained that they “could have long-term consequences (on Kentucky’s) 75,000 family farms that sell their crops around the globe, the hardworking Kentuckians who craft 95 percent of the world’s bourbon, (and) our auto industry that relies on global supply chains to support the livelihoods of thousands of workers in the commonwealth.”
Musk is threatening to spend campaign money against members of Congress who don’t support plans to devastate American families, so Barr is kneeling and kissing Musk’s ring.   
Although he’s trying hard to please Elon, Barr has a poor understanding of Kentucky politics if he thinks voters want a senator who licks the boots of an unelected oddball whose drug use and erratic behavior worry his closest associates.

(Photo by Charlotte Rene Woods/Virginia Mercury)Last summer, the city of Richmond made waves by announcing a $3 million dollar check for its residents to spend as they see fit. Now, the city is handing the reins over to its people, inviting everyone 14 years and older to vote on how that money should be allocated. From April 1 to 15, Richmonders can head to pop-up events around the city or log on to cast their votes for the projects they want to see funded in what the city has dubbed “The People’s Budget.”
Ideas on the table range from improvements to bus routes, tree plantings in underserved areas, and sidewalk enhancements for pedestrian safety, to more region-specific projects, like a “Welcome to Southside” sign at entry points to Richmond’s 8th City Council district, or better trail access to the James River in the 5th District. 
Instead of just picking one project, the process uses ranked choice voting, allowing participants to express preference for several initiatives. The People’s Budget initiative, which was led by former city councilor and mayoral candidate Andreas Addison, started with other pop-up events and online solicitation to gather input from residents across the city. 
As for the $3 million, it’s being divided across the city with a focus on equity. Isaac Samuels, lead organizer of the People’s Budget, explained that Districts 1, 2 and 4 will each get $200,000, while Districts 3, 5 and 7 will receive $300,000 each, and Districts 6, 8 and 9 will be allocated $500,000. The goal of this varied distribution is to direct funding to areas that have historically been underinvested in, ensuring that all of Richmond’s neighborhoods benefit.
Richmond’s Southside, home to many historically Black neighborhoods, has long faced challenges rooted in systemic inequality. Less tree canopy in these areas leads to higher ground temperatures during hot months, and a history of discriminatory housing policies has contributed to lower home values. 
In the 1930s, appraisers marked Black-populated neighborhoods nationwide in red, labeling them “hazardous” for home loans. The lasting impact of these racist practices is still evident today, with each negative appraisal continuing to affect future evaluations and resulting in less local government investment in public infrastructure.
“This is a big milestone for us,” Samuels said.
After months of outreach and community engagement, Samuels is thrilled to reach the voting phase, knowing the projects selected will soon become a reality. With voting ending on April 15, he expects the results to be available by April 21. 
From there, the implementation of winning proposals will vary based on which city  departments are involved and the procedural steps leading up to any development work. 
“We will be tracking it basically like a Domino’s Pizza Tracker on our website, noting every different step that we’re taking,” Samuels said.
 Ranked choice voting

Ranked choice voting gives Richmond residents a better shot at seeing their favorite projects come to life. If their top choice doesn’t get enough votes, their other picks may still make the cut, giving them a greater sense of influence over the outcome.
This voting method has gained traction in Virginia in recent years. Former state delegate Sally Hudson carried legislation that was signed into law in 2020, allowing localities to adopt ranked choice voting for city council and board of supervisor elections. Arlington was the first to use it in 2023, and Charlottesville is set to implement it this year. 
Richmond nearly became the first locality to adopt it in 2022, but city councilors were still unsure and ultimately voted it down. A major concern was that the law couldn’t be applied to school boards or citywide elections contests like Richmond’s mayor, who, unlike most Virginia localities, is separately elected instead of being a member of the city council. 
This year, a bill from Sen. Saddam Salim, D-Fairfax, aimed to expand ranked choice voting, but it was recently vetoed by Gov. Glenn Youngkin. Youngkin, who used ranked choice voting to secure his victory in the 2021 Republican gubernatorial convention, explained in his veto that more data was needed before expanding the method. 
He said doing so at this stage “risks institutionalizing a system that has yet to prove its effectiveness in broader elections.”
However, Hudson, now executive director of Ranked Choice Virginia, argues that Youngkin is overlooking “the growing body of evidence” showing successful ranked choice voting trials. 
Arlington has already used it in several elections, and Falls Church and Loudoun county are also considering adopting it. Both Hudson and UpVote Virginia executive director Liz White have pointed to expanding use of ranked choice voting nationwide. 
“I definitely see an increase in just people being familiar with it. I think that that, for us, is the biggest measure of progress,” White said. “The more people use it, the more people know about it, the more they like it.”
While more local elections are still waiting for the ability to use this method, White is thrilled to see it applied in Richmond’s People’s Budget. 
“There’s more nuance to (residents’) votes and they can provide so much more information with their vote,” White said. “I think that’s really cool.”

Legislators shied away from measures that would address the growing demand from data centers, but they also couldn’t bring themselves to improve the supply picture by supporting landowners who want to host solar facilities. By the time the session ended, a mere handful of bills had passed that could improve our ability to meet demand.  
Still, the initiatives that did pass offered positive steps forward on energy efficiency, distributed generation, interconnection of rooftop solar, energy storage, EV charging and utility planning. In addition, two data center-related bills passed requiring more planning and transparency during the local permitting process and tasking utilities with developing a demand response program to relieve some of the added burden on the grid.
Governor unleashes veto storm to drown progressive legislation

Sadly, however, Republican Gov. Glen Youngkin decided to use his powers of veto and amendment to water down or scuttle the limited (and mostly bipartisan) progress legislators made. The only two data center bills were effectively killed, as were most energy bills – some by veto, others by amendments that made them worse than no action at all. 
There’s nothing very subtle going on here. The governor loves data centers and isn’t about to limit their growth, regardless of the consequences to residential ratepayers and communities. He’s also stuck in a rut of attacking the Virginia Clean Economy Act (VCEA), which prioritizes low-cost renewable energy over legacy fossil fuels. He won’t be in office when the chickens come home to roost in the form of an electricity shortfall and skyrocketing rates, but he’s setting up his party to cast blame on the liberal climate agenda.   
 Data centers

The General Assembly failed to pass legislation that would have shifted responsibility for sourcing clean energy onto the data center operators. The only bill to pass that even makes energy a consideration in the siting of data centers is HB 1601, sponsored by Del. Josh Thomas, D-Gainesville. In addition to site assessment provisions at the permitting stage, it requires the utility serving the facility to describe any new electric generating units, substations and transmission voltage that would be required.
Facing data center sprawl and an energy crisis, Virginia lawmakers leap into action. Just kidding.

Limited as these provisions are, the governor proposed amendments to further weaken the bill, then added a clause requiring that for the bill to take effect, it has to be passed all over again in 2026. That’s a veto by another name. 
SB 1047 from Sen. Danica Roem, D-Manassas, requires utilities to implement demand-response programs for customers with a power demand of more than 25 MW, a way of  relieving grid constraints during times of high demand. The governor vetoed the bill, deeming it unnecessary. 
The only data center-related bill that did get the governor’s approval is one of questionable utility. HB 2084 from Del. Irene Shin, D-Herndon, merely requires the SCC to use its existing authority during a regular proceeding sometime in the next couple of years to determine whether Dominion and Appalachian Power are using reasonable customer classifications in setting rates, and if not, whether new classifications are reasonable. The SCC seems to be doing this already anyway, but maybe this lets our leaders claim they are doing something to protect residential ratepayers. Plus, they can now call it a bipartisan effort!
 Utility reform

 With Virginia fixed on a collision course between growing demand for energy from data centers and our leaders’ refusal to support low-cost solar to provide the power, it is more important than ever that our utilities engage in transparent and comprehensive planning through the integrated resource plans (IRPs) filed with the State Corporation Commission. Over the course of last fall, the Commission on Electric Utility Regulation hammered out what I think is truly good legislation to ensure Dominion and APCo present the information the SCC and the public need to be sure our utilities are making the decisions that will improve our energy position and put the needs of ratepayers ahead of corporate profits. 
In vetoing SB 1021 from Sen. Scott Surovell, D-Fairfax, and HB 2413 from Del. Candi Munyon-King, D-Dumfries, the governor offered this muddled statement: “The State Corporation Commission has the expertise and the authority to make requirements and changes to the integrated resource plan process. The Virginia Clean Economy Act is failing Virginia and those that champion it should stop trying to buttress this failing policy. But rather should be focused on procuring the dependable power needed to meet our growing demand through optimizing for reliability, affordability, and increasingly clean power generation.”
We get it: Johnny One-Note doesn’t like the VCEA. He said that already. But right now, APCo isn’t filing IRPs at all, and the SCC has been so frustrated with Dominion’s filings that it didn’t approve the last one, and demanded a supplement to the most recent one even before it was filed. Clearly the SCC could use a little help here.  
 Distributed energy sources

Advocates for small-scale solar were more successful this year than their colleagues who focus on utility-scale projects. Bipartisan majorities seemed to agree that if we can’t or won’t site large solar farms, at least we should make it easier to put solar on rooftops and other small sites close to users.
Utility regulator recommends suspension of Dominion’s rules for connecting new solar to grid

Sadly, however, only one bill survived the governor’s scrutiny relatively unscathed, though it’s an important one for customer-sited solar. HB 2266 from Del. Kathy Tran, D-Springfield, resolves the interconnection dispute that has stalled commercial solar projects in the 250 kW to 3 MW size range, which includes most rooftop solar on schools. Tran’s bill requires the SCC to approve upgrades to the distribution system that utilities say are needed to accommodate grid-connected solar, a safeguard that will prevent the utility from larding on costs. The utility must then spread the costs across all projects that benefit from the expanded capacity. 
Youngkin’s proposed amendment rearranges the language a bit and places it into a new section of code, but does not otherwise change it. He then adds a provision in the tax code to make grid upgrades tax-deductible. I would have thought they would be anyway, as business expenses, but it can only be helpful to spell it out.  
Unfortunately, that’s it for the good news. 
HB 1883 from Del. Katrina Callsen, D-Charlottesville, and SB 1040 from Sen. Schuyler VanValkenburg, D-Richmond, contain several provisions aimed at increasing the amount of distributed solar in Virginia. Among other things, the legislation increases the percentage of Dominion’s renewable portfolio standard (RPS) obligation that must be met with renewable energy certificates (RECs) from behind-the-meter small solar projects, a change that would make rooftop and other distributed solar more profitable for homeowners and businesses. 
HB 1883 also increases to 3 MW from 1 MW the size of solar projects that could qualify for this favored category. Additionally, for the first time it would give all residential ratepayers the right to use power purchase agreements (PPAs) to install solar with no money down, and would increase the amount of electricity Dominion would build or buy from solar facilities on previously developed project sites. To give the market a chance to ramp up, Callsen’s bill excuses Dominion from having to meet its REC obligations from Virginia projects for an additional two years, pushing that date from this year to 2027. 
Among all those changes, the only one the governor liked is the idea of softening the requirements around REC purchases. His proposed amendment would make all REC compliance voluntary for four years. Effectively, Virginia would have no renewable energy requirements until 2028, undercutting solar development of any size. His preferred version scraps all of the provisions of Callsen’s bill, leaving no provisions to support solar development and replacing them with an open attack on the VCEA. 
I checked in with Callsen by email to get her reaction. She responded, “We sent the administration bipartisan legislation that protects ratepayers, gives Virginians more options for solar on our homes and businesses, and saves rural land. Rather than sign HB 1883 into law,” Callsen wrote, “the governor used this opportunity to attack the Clean Economy Act from 2020. Instead of looking at the past, our Administration should look around; we have a developing energy crisis and are reliant on importing energy to meet our needs.”
The governor also offered a destructive amendment to HB 2346 from Del. Phil Hernandez, D-Norfolk, and SB 1100 from Sen. Ghazala Hashmi, D-Richmond, legislation establishing a pilot program in Dominion territory for virtual power plants (VPPs), which aggregate customer solar and storage resources and demand response capabilities. Although VPPs don’t by themselves add electricity on the grid, they allow time-shifting and other efficiencies that make it easier for utilities to meet peak demand without having to build new generation. The payments utilities make to customers for this service can justify customers’ investments in things like solar, battery storage and smart appliances.  
Instead of improving on the pilot program, however, the governor’s amendment scraps it and calls for the SCC to convene a proceeding to talk about VPPs. On the plus side, Youngkin suggests that the conversation include Appalachian Power as well as Dominion, and consider allowing the service to be provided by either the utilities or third-party aggregators, the latter being the favored approach of many industry members. Still, the amendment pushes off any hope of a program for at least another year, until the SCC has made its recommendations. Since it would have been feasible to both start a pilot program this year and have the SCC consider parameters for a broader program in the future, it’s hard to see the governor’s amendment as a step forward. 
When I asked her for a comment, Hashmi did not mince words, saying it was “incredibly disappointing” that Youngkin chose to offer a substitute instead of signing the legislation.
“This legislation was the result of several months of conversation among a variety of stakeholders, including our utility companies, energy partners, and environmental groups. The Virtual Power Plant has the promise of helping Virginia meet the goals of our increasing energy demands. The Governor’s substitute shows that he is not serious about responding to the growth of Virginia’s energy needs,” Hashmi wrote.
Other solar bills drew outright vetoes, including Munyon King’s HB 2356, establishing an apprenticeship program to help develop a clean energy workforce. The bill requires participants to be paid prevailing wages, a provision that was a certain veto magnet for Youngkin, whose veto statement reads, “This bill will increase the construction costs which will ultimately be passed along to ratepayers, raising costs for consumers.”
Another bill that drew an outright veto was HB 2037 from Del. David Bulova, D-Fairfax. His bill would allow local governments to include in their land development ordinances a requirement that certain non-residential applicants install solar on a portion of a parking lot. 
The governor vetoed it because, he said, it would be expensive for developers, and if it weren’t, they would do it without having to be told. (It’s a strange objection. Does he not understand the whole concept of government acting in the public good? Well, maybe not; see the veto.)
Also vetoed was Shin’s HB 2090, changing the rules around multifamily solar. Admittedly I was not crazy about this bill; although it allows solar facilities to be placed on nearby commercial buildings instead of being restricted to the multifamily building itself, it also imports the requirement for minimum bills that has made other shared solar programs in Virginia unworkable for all but the low-income customers who are excused from the minimum bills. 
Maybe the trade-off would have opened new opportunities for apartment buildings serving low-income households, which would make it a plus on balance. But among his objections to HB2090, the governor noted that excusing low-income customers from high minimum bills would shift costs onto other customers. 
 Energy efficiency

The governor vetoed SB 1342 from Sen. Lamont Bagby, D-Richmond, and HB 2744 from Del. Mark Sickles, D-Franconia, that would have pushed Dominion and APCo harder to provide energy efficiency upgrades to low-income homes, setting a target of 30% of qualifying households. 
He also vetoed SB 777 from Sen. Mamie Locke, D-Hampton, and HB 1935 from Del. Destiny LeVere Bolling, D-Richmond, which would have established a task force to address the needs of low-income customers for weatherization and efficiency upgrades. The governor said it isn’t needed. 
If you notice a pattern here when it comes to helping low-income households with their energy burden, you are not alone. 
Reached on maternity leave,  LeVere Bolling had this to say: “Across our Commonwealth, high utility bills are forcing Virginians to choose between essentials like groceries and medication and keeping their home at a safe temperature during hot summers and cold winters. Virginia has the 10th least affordable residential energy bills in the country. Over 75% of Virginia households have an energy burden higher than the 6% affordability threshold.” She added that the governor’s veto represents a “missed opportunity to address the pressing energy needs of Virginia’s most vulnerable communities.”
  Electric vehicles

The governor offered a substitute for a bill intended to support electric vehicle charging. As passed by the General Assembly, Shin’s HB 2087 requires Dominion and APCo to file detailed plans to “accelerate transportation electrification,” including for rural areas and economically disadvantaged communities. It also allows the utilities to file proposed tariffs with the SCC to supply the distribution infrastructure necessary for EV charging stations. 
The utilities are also authorized to develop their own fast-charging stations, but only at a distance from privately-owned charging stations, with the SCC determining the proper distance. This provision responds to the request of gas station chains like Sheetz that say they want to expand their EV charging options, but don’t want to face unfair competition from utilities that can rate-base their investments.
The governor’s amendment would prohibit Dominion and APCo from owning EV charging stations at all; in addition, it would allow retail providers of EV charging stations to buy electricity from any competitive service provider. However, the amendment repeals the section of code that allows the utilities to recover costs of investments in transportation electrification.  
According to Steve Banashek, EV legislative lead with the Virginia Sierra Club, that “negates the purpose of the enrolled bill.” The amendment, he told me in an email, “removes the requirement for utilities to file for tariffs to support implementation of EV charging and to plan for transportation electrification growth via the IRP process, which is critical for speeding up the transition to electric transportation.” 
As for the prohibition on the utilities owning charging stations, Banashek noted that there are areas of the state where private businesses aren’t likely to do it, including in those economically disadvantaged and rural communities. If we don’t want these areas left behind, either the utilities have to step up, or the state does.  
Apparently, however, Youngkin doesn’t intend for the state to do it either. Along with his amendments to Shin’s bill, the governor also vetoed HB 1791 from Sullivan, creating a fund to support EV charging in rural areas of the state.  
 Energy storage

The need for more energy storage seems like it would be one area of bipartisan consensus. Batteries and other forms of energy storage are critical to filling in the generation gaps for low-cost, intermittent forms of energy like wind and solar. 
But storage is also required to make full use of baseload sources like nuclear that either can’t be ramped down at times when there is a surplus of energy being produced, or where doing so makes it harder to recover the cost of building the generation. (The already-high projected cost of electricity from small modular nuclear reactors becomes even higher if you assume they don’t run when the power isn’t needed.) 
Sullivan’s HB 2537 increases the energy storage targets for Dominion and APCo, and includes new targets for long-duration energy storage. Unfortunately, Youngkin’s substitute language repeals the entire section of code that includes Virginia’s renewable portfolio standard as well as even the existing storage targets. It’s another bit of anti-VCEA flag-waving that won’t help anyone.  
Just in case you thought Youngkin might be adhering to conservative free market principles with some kind of consistency, I note that he signed HB 2540 and SB 1207 from two Republicans, Del. Danny Marshall of Danville and Sen. Tammy Brankley Mulchi of Clarksville, which provides a $60 million grant to a manufacturer of lithium-ion battery separators. 
I asked Sullivan for a comment on the governor’s action on his bill. He replied, “The Governor’s ridiculous ‘recommendation’ on HB 2537 was disappointing, but hardly surprising. This was not an amendment; he deleted everything – everything – having to do with energy storage, and turned it into a one-sentence bill which would repeal the entire Clean Economy Act.”
Moreover, wrote Sullivan, “HB 2537 was the most closely and extensively negotiated bill among stakeholders that I’ve been involved with since the VCEA. It had broad support – including from Dominion – and should have easily fit into the Governor’s ‘all of the above’ energy strategy and his economic development goals, since it would have brought all sorts of business, jobs, and companies to the Commonwealth.”  
Sullivan concluded, “Needless to say, we cannot agree to the amendment.  We’ll easily pass this bill next session, and I suspect Governor Spanberger will sign it.” 
Sullivan may be right that it will take a new administration before Virginia gets serious about meeting its energy challenges – if it does even then – but this session needn’t have ended in a partisan stalemate and near-zero progress. Most of the bills the governor vetoed or gutted were passed with the help of Republicans, making Youngkin’s actions less of a rebuke to Democrats than to the members of his own party who were simply trying to do their job. The results, sadly, are bad for everyone.

The issue of how best to provide services to people with intellectual and developmental disabilities is, admittedly, a challenging one.
Complex questions about the roles played by institutions and sheltered workshops, and the leeway given to families to chart their own courses in finding services, give rise to many competing and legitimate opinions.
That said, there’s one simple truth about IDD services in North Carolina that’s indisputable: they are inadequate.
Thanks to chronic underfunding by state legislators, the waiting list for coveted slots in the Innovations Waiver program is absurdly long. Indeed, there are more people waiting — over seventeen thousand — than there are people enrolled. It takes years to get through the waiting list and many people die before they ever do.
The bottom line: Several factors may feed into this scandalous situation but ultimately, they’re all rooted in the fact that our state’s cheapskate legislature refuses to appropriate the funds that would make it possible to attract and hire enough support workers. And until it does, thousands of families will continue to suffer.

Republicans looking to cut federal spending on Medicaid are eyeing work requirements as one possible option. (Justin Sullivan/Getty Images)Under an emerging Republican plan to require some Medicaid recipients to work, between 4.6 million and 5.2 million adults ages 19 to 55 could lose their health care coverage, according to a new analysis.
The study, conducted by Urban Institute researchers with support from the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation, calculated that up to 39% of the 13.3 million adults in that age group who became eligible for Medicaid when their states expanded the program under the Affordable Care Act would lose coverage if Congress required states to impose work rules.
The report suggests that most of those people would lose coverage not because they aren’t complying with the rules, but because they would struggle to report their compliance to the state.
“Most adults who would lose eligibility for federal Medicaid funding are working, engaged in work-related activities, or could qualify for exemptions not readily identifiable through state databases but could still face disenrollment because of the reporting requirements,” it states. The study identified several barriers to reporting, including lack of broadband access and lack of transportation.
Forty states plus the District of Columbia have expanded Medicaid under the ACA. Overall, nearly 72 million people, about a fifth of Americans, are enrolled in the program for low-income people, which is funded jointly by the federal government and the states.
Holdout states consider expanding Medicaid — with work requirements

Traditional Medicaid insurance was mainly available to children and their caregivers, people with disabilities and pregnant women. But the ACA, commonly known as Obamacare, allowed states to extend coverage to adults making up to 138% of the federal poverty level — about $21,000 a year for a single person.
Nationwide, more than 21 million people with low incomes have health insurance because of expanded Medicaid eligibility.
U.S. House Republicans in February pushed through a budget plan, now under consideration in the Senate, that would require about $880 billion in cuts to Medicaid over the next decade to help cover the cost of $4.5 trillion in tax cuts. The budget doesn’t contain specifics on how that target would be met. But work requirements are a likely money-saving option: A 2023 analysis from the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office found that imposing work rules on Medicaid recipients ages 19 to 55 who are not parents or caregivers would cut federal spending by an estimated $109 billion over the next 10 years.
The Congressional Budget Office based that projection on a plan the GOP-controlled U.S. House approved in 2023. That bill, the likely blueprint for the work requirements Republicans are considering now, would have required adults ages 19-55 to work, participate in a job training program or perform community service for at least 80 hours per month for three or more months in a calendar year. Parents and caretakers of dependent children, and those unable to work because of a health condition, would have been exempt.
Many Republican-led states are eager to impose work requirements on able-bodied Medicaid recipients. Thirteen states received permission to impose work rules on at least some Medicaid enrollees during the first Trump administration. Nine additional states requested permission to enact Medicaid work requirements during Trump’s earlier term but had not won approval by the time it ended.
When the Biden administration came into office, it rescinded all the approvals.
Supporters say requiring Medicaid recipients to work, study or train for a career gives them a boost toward self-sufficiency and financial stability. Critics, however, say such rules end up hurting far more people than they help.
Medicaid cuts could hurt older adults who rely on home care, nursing homes

The researchers from the Urban Institute mostly based their analysis on the experience of Arkansas, which in June 2018 became the first state to require some Medicaid recipients to work, volunteer, go to school or participate in job training to receive benefits. By the time a federal judge halted the policy in April 2019, 18,000 adults had lost coverage.
The researchers also looked at New Hampshire, which began implementing a work requirement but halted the program in July 2019 before suspending anyone’s coverage.
“What was found in a lot of qualitative research on the previous work requirement programs is that a lot of people were unaware of the policy, or they didn’t understand the policy,” said Michael Karpman, an Urban Institute researcher who co-authored the study.
“People who need coverage the most would do the most to try to maintain it. On the other hand, those people could also face the most difficulty with the administrative barriers,” Karpman said.
In a 2020 study examining how Arkansas’ last experience with work requirements played out, researchers from the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health “found no evidence that the policy succeeded in its stated goal of promoting work and instead found substantial evidence of harm to health care coverage and access.”
Arkansas Republican Gov. Sarah Huckabee Sanders announced in January that she would ask the federal government for permission to institute work requirements, regardless of what Congress decides. The state submitted the request last week.










Especially for a rural state like Arkansas, work requirements fail to take into account a lot of the realities that people may face.


– Christin Harper, policy director for Arkansas Advocates for Children and Families


Arkansas Republican state Rep. Aaron Pilkington, who serves on the health committee in his chamber, said lawmakers “learned our lesson from the last go-round.”
Pilkington said that under the new proposal, the state will only pause coverage instead of canceling it, giving recipients an opportunity to prove they are complying. And, he said, the online portal for reporting will be a lot more user-friendly.
“I think it’s a reasonable thing to ask for able-bodied people to look for work, or try to obtain work,” Pilkington said.
But Christin Harper, policy director for Arkansas Advocates for Children and Families, said even the new version would be a challenge for many enrollees. Many people on Medicaid are juggling multiple jobs, and having to report to the state every month would be a significant burden.
“Especially for a rural state like Arkansas, work requirements fail to take into account a lot of the realities that people may face,” Harper said. She added that “with the overall job market, job opportunities may or may not be available in some of these rural towns.”

Students donning black graduation robes held a mock funeral for the death of higher education after Ohio Gov. Mike DeWine signed a bill into law that will overhaul the state’s public universities. 
The Ohio Student Association organized the event, which took place Monday afternoon in the Statehouse Rotunda, days after DeWine signed Ohio Senate Bill 1. 
S.B. 1 will ban diversity efforts, prohibit faculty strikes, regulate classroom discussion of “controversial” topics, create post-tenure reviews, put diversity scholarships at risk, create a retrenchment provision that block unions from negotiating on tenure, shorten university board of trustees terms from nine years down to six years, and require students take an American history course, among other things. 
SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
For classroom discussion, the bill will set rules around topics involving “controversial beliefs” such as climate policies, electoral politics, foreign policy, diversity and inclusion programs, immigration policy, marriage, or abortion. It prohibits professors from “indoctrination,” and while it doesn’t define that, it allows complaints to be filed against professors for review by the Chancellor of the Ohio Department of Higher Education. S.B. 1 will only affect Ohio’s public universities and community colleges. 
“It was really surprising, the quickness that it was signed,” said Ohio State University junior Brielle Shorter. “I think signing it at such a time was really interesting as well, but it was truly heartbreaking.”
DeWine got the bill Wednesday — the same day the Ohio Senate concurred with changes to the bill made by the Ohio House — and he signed it Friday. 
“As a Black student on campus, our spaces have already been slowly getting demolished,” Shorter said. “I believe that with this bill there’s going to be more changes like that.” 
Ohio State University is closing its Office of Diversity and Inclusion

Ohio State recently closed its Office of Diversity and Inclusion and the Office of Student Life’s Center for Belonging and Social Change in response to the U.S. Department of Education’s Dear Colleague letter that threatened to rescind federal funds for schools that use race-conscious practices in admissions, programming, training, hiring, scholarships, and other aspects of student life.
Shorter said she has seen Ohio high school students post on social media how they are no longer interested in attending Ohio universities and instead plan to go to school out of state. 
Scott DiMauro, president of the Ohio Education Association, said it is unfortunate DeWine signed S.B. 1 into law.
“It’s disappointing to see that he did that, even though the overwhelming amount of opposition that was expressed on the bill from faculty and from students and from concerned citizens was strongly against it,” he said. “I think it’s unfortunate to see collective bargaining rights of people who work in higher education diminished.”
Pranav Jani, president of Ohio State’s American Association of University Professors chapter, said they will fight the impact of the bill as it becomes law. 
“We know that we stand with thousands of educators, students, and parents, who are disgusted by this naked display of governmental repression of higher education,” he said in a statement. 
State Sen. Jerry Cirino, R-Kirtland, introduced S.B. 1, which took just over two months to pass both chambers and be signed into law. 
“I believe this is monumentally significant legislation that will allow Ohio’s public universities and community colleges to deal with looming enrollment challenges and usher in a renaissance of academic excellence,” Cirino said in a statement.

Some school boards have passed policies laying out an explicit mechanism to challenge books or other materials; others have much sparser language. 
This year, Republican lawmakers are seeking to make the process easier. The House and Senate are moving to require New Hampshire schools to allow parents to challenge books and other materials they deem obscene, and to create formal appeals processes for weighing those challenges.
“This bill is about materials that are harmful to minor children in schools and the ability for parents to object to them,” wrote Rep. Glenn Cordelli, a Tuftonboro Republican and the chairman of the House Education Policy and Administration Committee. 
But Democrats, public school advocates, and civil rights groups have strongly objected, arguing the new process could allow parents to target materials that tackle race and LGBTQ+ issues, and arguing that school districts should design their own policies.
A representative from Penguin Random House, the book publisher, submitted written testimony to the committee in early March objecting to the bill.
“HB 324 is problematic due to overly broad language, redundancy with existing laws, and potential intimidation of educators and librarians that will negatively affect book and material selection in New Hampshire’s schools and libraries,” wrote Skip Dye, the chairman of the publisher’s Intellectual Freedom Taskforce.
Dye continued: “Ultimately, it will deprive young readers access to literature that is crucial for their intellectual and emotional development. And without non-discrimination provisions, the lowered standard in this bill may be weaponized against minority voices.” 
The legislation echoes efforts by Republicans in past years. This year, lawmakers appear more likely to succeed. House Bill 324 passed the House on March 26, 183-148, along a near party line vote, while the Senate passed Senate Bill 33 on March 30 with a 16-8 vote. 
But the chambers don’t yet fully agree on key issues. The House-endorsed bill goes further than its Senate counterpart, including more appeals processes for parents and more potential penalties for schools. 
HB 324 would mandate that school boards pass policies that allow parents to complain that certain materials are harmful to minors and should be removed from the school district.
In order to be “harmful to minors,” the material must “predominantly appeal to the prurient, shameful, or morbid interest of minors”; must depict or describe nudity, sexual conduct, sexual excitement, or sadomasochistic abuse; must be “patently offensive to prevailing standards” of what is offense to minors; must lack “serious” literary, scientific, medical, artistic, or political value; and must be inappropriate to the age group to which it is available, according to the bill.
The material must meet all of those conditions in order to qualify as harmful, according to the bill. The material could include books, magazines, movies, pamphlets, recordings, photos, figures, statues, plays, dances, and any other visual presentation, web-based content, and live performance.
Under the bill, school boards must pass policies that allow a parent or guardian to make a complaint alleging that a teaching material in that school district violates the law. At that point, the school’s principal or a designee would have 14 calendar days to make a decision whether the material was in violation and whether it should be removed.
If the principal decided the material did not violate the law, the parent could appeal the decision to the school board. 
SB 33 requires a similar complaint process. 
But HB 324 adds two additional provisions that have vexed opponents. 
First, if the school board also rules against the complaining parent, that parent can appeal a final time to the State Board of Education, HB 324 states. The State Board’s decision is final. 
Second, under HB 324, school districts and individual teachers can face consequences if a material is decided to be prohibited and the school continues to provide that material anyway. School districts can be sued by parents; teachers and other staff can face disciplinary sanctions by the State Board of Education for violating the educator code of conduct. 
It is not clear which version of the legislation might pass both the House and Senate. The chambers could enter “committee of conference” negotiations to find agreement in June.
Barrett Christina, executive director of the New Hampshire School Boards Association, says the association objects to HB 324 for two reasons: the potential liability it creates for school boards who are sued by parents, and the ability for the state board to override the school board’s authority over the materials.
“We think that the local school board should have the authority to determine what’s in their local libraries,” Christina said. He added: “The primary reason why we don’t think an appeal to the State Board of Education is appropriate is that it leaves voters without any local recourse. If the local school board chooses to keep a book in the library and the voters don’t like that decision, they can vote for new school board members at the next election.” 
Since 2004, the School Boards Association has had a model policy it has recommended that schools adopt that covers challenges to materials in school. And Christina says he understands the desire to standardize the process to reduce confusion, especially as book challenges have become more frequent in the past five years.
But to Christina, any policy passed by the Legislature should meet two criteria: There should be well-defined deadlines for parents and school officials, and there should be clear definitions for what type of material violates the statute. HB 324 doesn’t meet those criteria, he argued. 
Absent that clarity, the law could prompt school districts to agree to move more books than they should, he said. 
“Nobody wants to be sued and nobody wants to subject themselves to civil penalties,” Christina said. “So the potential is that it may create a chilling effect with respect to what books local school boards decide to keep in their libraries.” 
Speaking from the floor, Cordelli argued the state board should be included in the process. 
“HB 324 establishes a minimum process for which parents can bring what they consider inappropriate materials to their principal and the school board, and yes, if necessary, to the state board,” he said. “Because we have in statute a duty of the state board to hear complaints from parents.” 
Cordelli added: “This is not banning of books. It is about making sure that our children — your children — have books that are age-appropriate.”",https://newhampshirebulletin.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/librarybooks-1024x682.jpeg,,,2025-04-01 06:00:15.938269

Dream Point can house as many as 40 people. (Photo: Bertie County Schools)Two bills filed in the North Carolina House in recent days would make it easier for local governments and developers to build, manage and maintain workforce housing.
House Bill 306 would authorize Blowing Rock, Boone, Watauga County and the Watauga County Board of Education to construct and provide affordable employee housing on property owned by the governmental units.
The bill comes as western North Carolina struggles to rebuild in the aftermath of Hurricane Helene, which devastated the region a little more than six months ago. Approximately 73,700 homes in the region suffered damage and more than 8,800 homes had major damage or were destroyed. The price tag for housing assistance has been estimated at $15.4 billion.   
HB 306 was filed by Rep. Ray Pickett, a Blowing Rock Republican but has bipartisan support. Reps. Vernetta Alston and Zack Hawkins, both Durham Democrats, are among the bill’s cosponsors. Alston filed a bill last year to build allow workforce housing to be built in Durham.  The bill never got off the ground. Several previous attempts to get legislation passed to build workforce housing in Durham also failed to win support from Republican leader who control the General Assembly.
Under HB 306, the governmental units may provide workforce housing separately or through a partnership, joint venture, land trust or similar entity. It also authorizes them to contract to finance, construct or maintain affordable housing for local government employees and to rent or sell affordable housing for residential use exclusively to local government unit employees. Local governments may “charge below-market rates, offer below-market financing, and place reasonable restrictions and buyback provisions on the resale of housing units,” the bill states.
Workforce housing already exists in North Carolina and has been used by some counties to attract and retain teachers, particularly to rural regions where lower tax bases make it difficult to pay competitive local salary supplements. Local supplements are paid from local funds. It’s money teachers receive on top of state pay. Wealthier counties such as Durham, Orange and Wake can pay higher supplements.
Low wealth counties see workforce housing as a way to attract and retain teachers. Less than a year ago, Bertie County, one of the state’s low-wealth counties, opened a 24-unit, two-bedroom apartment complex it built to provide housing for as many as 40 teachers
“Rural communities like Bertie [County] often lose out attracting viable candidates to urban areas where there is shopping, great restaurants, entertainment and other amenities,” BCS Superintendent Otis Smallwood told Newsline last year. “In addition, Bertie County…is not able to pay teachers large local supplements like larger districts. Layer all of that with inadequate housing and you have a recipe for not being able to attract enough talent to educate the youth in our community. In many instances, we have to rely on recruiting international teachers.”
North Carolina already has several affordable housing projects for teachers. Duke TeachHouse in Durham, for example, is a living and learning community for early career teachers and graduates of Duke University’s teacher preparation programs. Others include Williams Baldwin Court in Asheville for teachers who work for Buncombe County Schools and Asheville City Schools, and Hertford Pointe in Ahoskie for Hertford County Schools’ teachers. The Dare County Education Foundation offers 24 housing units in Kill Devil Hills and 12 units in Hatteras for teachers employed by Dare County Schools.
Preconstruction loans for workforce housing
Another bill introduced in the House on Monday would create a revolving loan fund in the North Carolina Housing Finance Agency to provide short-term financing to support preconstruction costs of workforce housing projects.
House Bill 603 was filed by Democratic Leader Robert Reives. It would create the Workforce Housing Preconstruction Revolving Loan Program to make loans available to developers before they obtain permanent, private financing.
Eligible uses for loans would include land surveys, environmental due diligence and soil testing, utility connections, planning and permit fees and site clearing and grading. Loans would be capped at $1 million.
Under HB 603, 80% of projects would be reserved for counties designated as development Tier 1 and Tier 2 areas. Counties with those designations are among the state’s most economically distressed.  The remaining 20% would be reserved for projects in, wealthier Tier 3 areas.",https://ncnewsline.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Dream-Point-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-04-01 06:00:15.938269

(Photo by Travis Bell/STATEHOUSE CAROLINA/Special to the SC Daily Gazette)COLUMBIA — Legislation touted by GOP leaders as making South Carolina’s tax code appear more competitive would require most tax filers to pay more initially, according to an analysis by state fiscal experts.
Collapsing South Carolina’s tax brackets into a single flat tax rate of 3.99% in 2026 would reduce state revenues by $216.6 million overall.
But that’s done by broadening and shifting the tax burden: 19.4% of filers would owe less in spring 2027, while a whopping 59.4% of filers would owe more; 21.2% would experience no change, according to the fiscal impact report by the state Revenue and Fiscal Affairs Office released ahead of Tuesday’s first hearing on the bill.


An income tax shift
The bill proposes collapsing SC’s three tax brackets to a flat 3.99% in 2026. How that would shift the liability for tax filings due in spring 2027:

19.4% would see a collective decrease of $1.16 billion
21.2% of tax filers would see no change
59.5% would see a collective increase of $938.7 million

Source: S.C. Revenue and Fiscal Affairs Office


The analysis cautions against generalizing: “The impact on individual taxpayers varies widely within each range depending on the specific tax situation of each tax filer,” reads the seven-page summary signed by the office’s director, Frank Rainwater.
Still, the report provides hard estimates on how many South Carolina taxpayers will pay more versus less — and the extent of the swings per taxpayers’ income levels after all applicable deductions, exemptions and tax credits are applied to reduce their reported earnings.
Of the nearly 1.7 million tax filers expected to pay more in state income taxes under the plan, their increase for calendar year 2026 will average $560, with hikes ranging from $98 on the low end of income levels to over $10,000 for taxpayers reporting more than $1 million in adjusted income.
That compares to about 550,000 tax filers who will see an average decrease of $2,110.
Thanks to a new personal income deduction for low-income earners, several hundred people at the bottom end of the pay scale would see an average decrease of $3,700, while tens of thousands of people reporting $30,000 to $50,000 of income would see a dip of less than $40.
On the top end of the scale, roughly 9,900 tax filers reporting more than $1 million would see their income tax liability plummet by an average of $31,000.
More people would be contributing to state coffers.
Under the proposal, 23% of tax filers would still pay zero in income taxes. But that compares to roughly 45% currently, according to the Revenue and Fiscal Affairs Office.
“Everybody has to pay something — a little something, at least — to be a part of this great state of South Carolina,” Gov. Henry McMaster said last week when the plan was announced.
The new personal adjustment would provide a $6,000 deduction for single filers making up to $30,000, then provide some relief up to $40,000 of income. Married couples filing jointly could deduct $12,000 for incomes up to $60,000, with the deduction phasing out at $80,000.
Republicans’ ‘historic’ tax-cut plan attempts to give SC competitive edge

Still, looking at South Carolinians reporting an adjusted gross income between zero and $40,000, nearly 714,400 tax filers will owe more, while fewer than 20,000 would pay less.
The plan accomplishes what Republicans have long wanted: a tax structure that looks to be among the nation’s lowest. Collapsing three tax brackets to 3.99% would make South Carolina’s flat tax rate the lowest in the Southeast, except for Florida and Tennessee, which don’t have a state income tax.
In 2022, the Legislature passed a law that phased in a tax cut of more than $1 billion, but it still left the top marginal rate as the highest in the Southeast this year at 6.2%. However, the effective rate — what tax filers actually pay — was among the nation’s lowest even before the 2022 law.
The bill promises to keep cutting the rate as revenue collections increase. For every year income tax projections rise by 5%, the bill would reduce revenue by another $200 million until the tax rate gets to 2.49%.
When and if that happens, then the bill would truly be a tax cut for the overwhelming majority of South Carolinians: More than 77% of tax filers would see a collective decrease in their income taxes of $2.5 billion, compared to tax year 2026; 23% would still see no change whatsoever, but no one would pay more.
How many years it would take to get to 2.49% would depend on the economy and income growth.
Advocates promise to make the Legislature’s ruling Republicans feel the pressure to pass the bill.
The state chapter of Americans for Prosperity announced last week plans to launch a “six figure campaign” urging legislators to approve the plan. The group’s marketing push will include mailings, as well as online and radio ads and an “unmatched grassroots presence” going door to door asking residents to call their legislators.

Period.
But now Ohio Attorney General Dave Yost and some other Republican attorneys general are in court defending President Donald Trump’s executive order claiming that “birthright citizenship” doesn’t extend to children of the undocumented.
 Trump also claims the power to unilaterally deny citizenship to babies of those with “lawful but temporary” presence in the United States. 
The arguments made by Trump, Yost, and the other attorneys general are “just silly,” a Cleveland immigration attorney said. And she added that they further endanger some of the most vulnerable.
Trump issued the executive order on his first day in office. It claims that the 14th Amendment of the United States Constitution doesn’t guarantee citizenship to babies born to undocumented immigrants or those with temporary status, such as holders of student or visitors’ visas.
The order directed federal agencies to stop issuing citizenship documents to those babies. The courts blocked enforcement of the order a few weeks later. Trump is appealing the matter to the U.S. Supreme Court.
Trump wants Supreme Court to let him mostly carry out birthright citizenship order

On March 20, Yost took to X to defend the president’s stance.
“Birthright citizenship in the United States is limited by the Constitution to those persons who are ‘subject to the jurisdiction thereof,'” he wrote. “Those words must mean something, and they mean *at least* this: it doesn’t include those who are here illegally.”
Unsettling
Yost is running in the 2026 governor’s race, and he’s shown sympathy with some of Trump’s extreme statements about immigrants as he has. 
Trump and now-Vice President J.D. Vance last summer repeated the lie that Haitian immigrants in Springfield were stealing neighbors’ pets and eating them. That prompted dozens of bomb threats to elementary schools and other public buildings in the small Ohio city, which Vance was then representing in the U.S. Senate. 
Yost, Ohio’s top law-enforcement officer, piled on, criticizing the news media for taking the word of the Springfield police chief over rumors as they assessed whether the racist claims were true.
Now Yost is backing Trump’s claims about birthright citizenship.
The right is embedded in the 14th Amendment, which was ratified 1868 in the wake of the Civil War. Its main purpose was to safeguard the rights of newly freed slaves and repudiate the 1857 Supreme Court decision Dred Scott v Sandford. 
That decision held that slaves and former slaves were not citizens and therefore could not sue in the federal courts. It is widely regarded as one of the worst Supreme Court decisions ever rendered — largely because it was rooted in racist dogma.
Blacks “had for more than a century before been regarded as beings of an inferior order, and altogether unfit to associate with the white race, either in social or political relations; and so far inferior, that they had no rights which the white man was bound to respect; and that the negro might justly and lawfully be reduced to slavery for his benefit,” Chief Justice Roger Taney wrote in the decision.
The ruling was a key factor in provoking a civil war that killed more than 35,000 Ohioans. After it was over, the Constitution was amended to expand citizenship rights and ensure that the forces of racism could not trample them.
“All persons born or naturalized in the United States, and subject to the jurisdiction thereof, are citizens of the United States and of the State wherein they reside,” the first section of the amendment says. “No State shall make or enforce any law which shall abridge the privileges or immunities of citizens of the United States; nor shall any State deprive any person of life, liberty, or property, without due process of law; nor deny to any person within its jurisdiction the equal protection of the laws.”
“Some dumb campaign promise”
A century-and-a-half later, Trump is trying to narrow the application of those rights by presidential decree.
Yost and 16 other Republican attorneys general signed on with Iowa AG Brenna Bird in a friend-of-the-court brief supporting Trump’s executive order. While the 14th Amendment was intended to expand citizenship rights, the brief seeks to limit them.
“This case is not about whether birthright citizenship is guaranteed under our Constitution,” the brief says. “It is. Instead, the proper framing of this case asks where the limits of birthright citizenship end.”
Regardless of the merits of that claim, the brief ignores an even more fundamental issue — whether the president has the power to unilaterally declare the courts’ long-running interpretation of the U.S. Constitution null and void, said Heather Prendergast, a Cleveland immigration attorney.
“The whole thing seems so silly to me,” she said. “It’s a joke. (Trump) made some dumb campaign promise that he really doesn’t have the authority to produce. Then he says on day one, ‘Here’s an executive order doing something I can’t do, but I’ve convinced myself is possible.'”
She added, “This is not something the president has the authority to do via executive order. Our government has three branches. If they wanted to change the rules regarding birthright citizenship, it would require an act of Congress, a constitutional amendment. The president doesn’t make the laws. He executes the laws. He doesn’t just get to say, ‘Today this is how we’re going to interpret birthright citizenship.'” 
Third judge blocks Trump’s executive order to end birthright citizenship

In a January interview with Harvard Law Today, law school Professor Gerald Newman said much the same thing.
“The president of the United States has no authority to change citizenship rules at all,” he said.
Who is subject?
Yost’s office didn’t respond to a series of questions for this story other than to refer to the friend-of-the-court brief. 
In it, Yost and his colleagues don’t address one extreme aspect of Trump’s executive order — that the children of people legally here on temporary visas aren’t automatically citizens under the 14th Amendment. 
They instead argue that those rights don’t extend to the children of undocumented immigrants. To support this argument, they claim that undocumented immigrants are not “subject to the jurisdiction” of the United States as required by the 14th Amendment.
“The Constitution never required every person who happened to be born on United States soil to be a citizen,” the Republican AGs’ brief says. “Nor is that the original meaning of the Fourteenth Amendment’s ‘subject to the jurisdiction thereof.'”
Never mind that in 1868 the United States had open borders, so the concept of being undocumented would have been alien to those who wrote and ratified the 14th Amendment. 
Writing in January, Alex Nowrasteh of the libertarian Cato Institute said arguments such as the one in the AGs’ brief misstate what the 14th Amendment says. The concept of birthright citizenship predates it in U.S. jurisprudence, and even goes back to 17th century English common law, he said.
Nowrasteh quoted U.S. Sen. Jacob Howard of Michigan who introduced the 14th Amendment. In a statement defending it, Howard said birthright citizenship extended to everybody, but “will not, of course, include persons born in the United States who are foreigners, aliens, who belong to the families of ambassadors or foreign ministers” who have diplomatic immunity.
Trump and his supporters might try to torture that sentence into meaning undocumented immigrants and the babies of foreign diplomats are not entitled to birthright citizenship. But Nowrasteh said that goes against what Howard was plainly saying.
“Howard was describing the families of ambassadors as being foreigners and aliens,” Nowrasteh wrote.
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
Case in point
Even after Congress began restricting who could become a citizen merely by coming here, the Supreme Court ruled that being born in the United States made one a citizen with two exceptions — being born to a foreign diplomat or to a member of an invading force.
The Chinese Exclusion Act of 1882 placed a 10-year ban on Chinese immigration and prohibited Chinese who had already entered from getting citizenship. The legislation is considered highly racist because it singles out one ethnicity and it arose out of concern over the ethnic composition of the United States. Trump’s attempted Muslim bans have faced similar criticism.
Despite the Chinese Exclusion Act, the Supreme Court in 1898 ruled in U.S. v Wong Kim Ark that children born on U.S. soil to non-diplomat Chinese parents are citizens.
As a young man in 1895, Wong Kim Ark visited China and was denied reentry to the United States. He took the matter to court and three years later, the justices ruled 6-2 that the 14th Amendment made him a citizen.
“The Amendment, in clear words and in manifest intent, includes the children born, within the territory of the United States, of all other persons, of whatever race or color, domiciled within the United States,” Justice Horace Gray wrote for the majority. “Every citizen or subject of another country, while domiciled here, is within the allegiance and the protection, and consequently subject to the jurisdiction, of the United States.”
In their brief, Yost and his colleagues claim that immigration laws passed after the 14th Amendment was ratified limit its scope.
“… Wong Kim Ark repeatedly emphasized that its facts involved lawful, permanent United States residents... ” the brief says. “Even its holding stressed the importance of lawful residence: ‘so long as they are permitted by the United States to reside here’… Wong Kim Ark did not address children born to illegal immigrants or birth tourists.”
However, that statement seems to ignore the plain language of the Supreme Court ruling — that Congress can’t pass laws that shrink the rights provided by the 14th Amendment.
“The acts of Congress known as the Chinese Exclusion Acts, the earliest of which was passed some fourteen years after the adoption of the Constitutional Amendment, cannot control its meaning or impair its effect, but must be construed and executed in subordination to its provisions,” it said.
In other words, statutes passed by Congress can’t trump the Constitution.
“The 1898 Supreme Court decision of United States v. Wong Kim Ark established that the US-born children of immigrants were and remained citizens even if there were changes in law that would not have allowed them or their parents to legally immigrate here or naturalize,” wrote Nowrasteh of the Cato Institute.
Shaky justification
Prendergast, the Cleveland immigration lawyer, also questioned a key justification Yost and the Republican AGs gave in their attempt to limit birthright citizenship. 
The brief said it was important to remove incentives for undocumented people to come to the United States with the sole purpose of having citizen children. That implies that having citizen babies would make it easier for their parents to stay. And that ignores that it’s much, much harder than most people think for undocumented parents to get permanent residency, Prendergast said. 
“They act like somehow, birthright citizenship is a real draw; that people can come over here, have babies and somehow the babies themselves are going to acquire legal status for them,” Predergast said. “But a child can’t petition for their parents (to have permanent-resident status) until they’re 21 years old.”
She added that if the parents are in the United States without documents, they’re subject to more requirements when the child finally turns 21. In the vast majority of cases, they have to return to their home countries, go to a consulate, apply, and then wait 10 years.
Politicians’ talk of a border ‘invasion’ is speech that experts say has gotten people killed

“It’s a complicated process,” Predergast said.
The brief onto which Yost signed also echoes Trump’s claim that crossings at the southern border amount to an “invasion.” Despite their claims, Trump, Yost and Texas Gov. Greg Abbott have never shown that the typically peaceful southern border has been crossed in recent decades by hostile tanks or helicopters as part of a coordinated military force.
Yost’s office didn’t respond when asked if he was worried that such inflammatory rhetoric would result in another racist massacre like the one that happened in 2019. Spun up on racist rhetoric, 21-year-old Patrick Crusius, drove 600 miles from the Dallas area to an El Paso Walmart and started shooting every Hispanic-looking person he saw. In a manifesto he posted just before he murdered 23 and wounded 22, he wrote, “This attack is a response to the Hispanic invasion of Texas.”
Prendergast said the friend-of-the-court brief the Ohio attorney general joined isn’t a serious legal effort — it’s just more toxic politics.
“I don’t think most people take it seriously,” she said. “It’s a chaos agent, meant to create fear and division.”

(Photo by Kevin Dietsch/Getty Images)As the spring earth thaws and rains drench New Hampshire, our infamous mud season has arrived. And, blowing in like a lion along with it is Elon Musk’s Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), whose mission includes defunding essential environmental agencies.
Federal funding has been frozen for New Hampshire farmers’ U.S. Department of Agriculture grants, like the rural energy programs designed to support farmers making efficiency improvements. Other programs that provide technical and financial assistance to those who prioritize soil health, wildlife habitat, and water and air quality in their agricultural practices or are transitioning to renewable energy systems are also facing stalled funding.
The New Hampshire Food Bank recently lost nearly $1 million in federal funding for its NH Feeding NH program, which purchases fresh produce in bulk from local farmers and assists partner agencies with buying culturally preferred foods for New Americans.
The U.S. House has also proposed $12 billion in cuts to school meal programs, affecting 12 million students in 24,000 schools nationwide. As Dorothy McAuliffe, the former first lady of Virginia, once lamented, “Kids can’t be hungry for knowledge if they’re just plain hungry.”
Drastic cuts in EPA funding have escalated the “forever chemical” crisis. Mark Ruffalo, actor and activist, has pleaded with Congress to stop PFAS at the source, knowing that exposure to the forever chemicals has been linked to health risks such as cancer, birth defects, reproductive and developmental disorders, and weakened immune systems.
In his testimony he cites Manchester as an example “where a wastewater treatment plant burns sewage sludge just steps from homes, an elementary school, a baseball field, and the Merrimack River.” This plant, he said, “is the only facility in the state with a sludge incinerator, and in 2018 alone, it burned more than 4,000 dry metric tons of it. That’s happening just two miles from neighborhoods already struggling with high levels of toxic air pollution.”
Ruffalo points to the solution: a Clean Water Act permit protecting waters from pollution,  specifically, renewing Manchester’s permit with stronger regulations to curb PFAS from entering the wastewater facility from upstream industries. Remarkably, Ruffalo notes, the current draft permit contains no such requirement. After “treatment” this toxic stew is spread as fertilizer over farmers’ fields where it leaches into the groundwater supply.
Pristine waterways will undoubtedly suffer severe environmental degradation as wetlands eventually lose their primary function to purify water, prevent flooding, and protect critical wildlife habitat. The EPA is currently ordered to scale back wetland regulations and oversight in favor of state and industry control. Tom Irwin of the Conservation Law Foundation (CLF) warns that newly filed bills in the New Hampshire Legislature supported by the fossil fuel industry would, if passed, greatly weaken renewable energy programs by boosting oil and gas production over solar and wind energy.
A recent “Saturday Night Live” spoof featured the character Debbie Downer complaining to actor Robert De Niro that “we’re all walking landfills.” De Niro replied that the world “is like living in a full diaper.” In the soil of this morass we’re growing “natural” seeds coated with EPA approved radioactive waste. Despite these odds a unique seed variety persists, immutable and treatment resistant, one honored by the contemporary poet Dinos Christianopoulos in his couplet, “what didn’t you do to bury me / but you forgot that I was a seed.”
His acknowledgement of resilience and resistance serves as a call to action. Just like borrowing a book, you can sign out seeds for your garden from your local library or join the Surfrider Foundation’s cleanups of New Hampshire beaches or become a citizen scientist conducting water monitoring tests for the Nashua River Watershed Association. You can join Sy Montgomery’s team of turtle rescuers and rehabilitators described in her book “Of Time and Turtles: Mending the World, Shell by Shattered Shell.”
You can even volunteer with UNH’s rescue program, Nature Groupie. As thousands of amphibians migrate each spring to vernal pools and other wetlands to breed, the group organizes salamander crossing brigades at amphibian road crossings to help move them by hand (and keep count) during one or more “Big Nights.”
Saving small creatures brings the following parable inspired by Loren Eiseley to mind. A man walking along a beach noticed a boy picking something up and gently throwing it into the ocean. When asked what he was doing, the boy replied, “Throwing starfish back into the ocean. The tide is going out and if I don’t throw them back, they’ll die.” The man replied, “Son, don’t you realize there’s miles and miles of beach and hundreds of starfish. You can’t possibly make a difference.” Bending down to throw another starfish into the surf, the boy said with a smile, “I made a difference for that one.”

Local and state organizations such as the United Way of Central Ohio, Integrated Services for Behavioral Health, The Boys & Girls Clubs of Central Ohio, the Corporation for Ohio Appalachian Development, the Ohio Urban Community Action Network, and Lutheran Social Services of Central Ohio signed a letter asking that an expansion to publicly funded child care and the Child Care Choice Voucher Program be maintained, and for the child tax credit to move along with other measures to help Ohioans pay for and support their children.
Dozens of individuals also signed the letter, including Franklin County Commissioner Erica Crawley, a former Ohio lawmaker herself.
“These proposals from Governor (Mike) DeWine represent a critical step toward making life more affordable for families, and ensuring children have a strong start to life,” Crawley wrote in a statement announcing the letter. “And make no mistake, it will be good for businesses and our economy as well.”
The commissioner said there is a “direct link” between a productive workforce and affordable quality child care, care that is “out of reach for far too many families in our state.”
Danielle Sydnor, CEO of the RISE Together Innovation Institute, a group which signed the letter, opined about the struggles of Ohio families who are fighting just to afford “basic necessities like housing, child care and groceries.”
“We stand in coalition to show overwhelming support to lower the cost of child care and to provide tax relief for working families,” Sydnor wrote in a statement. “Together, we urge lawmakers to prioritize relief for families in state budget negotiations.”

The letter was centered around organizations and individuals in Franklin County, pleading with state legislators to consider the “future priorities of Central Ohio and our state.”
“Housing and child care costs have surged, wages haven’t kept pace, and too many working people find themselves forced to make impossible choices between rent, child care, health care, and groceries,” according to the letter.
The proposed child tax credit, which would give a maximum of $1,000 per child ages 0 to 6, would allow for financial relief, the groups and individuals who signed the letter said.
Along with that, expansions to child care in the state to bring the eligibility of both publicly funded child care and the Child Care Choice Voucher Program to 200% of the federal poverty line would “make life a little more affordable for working families.”
“The choices you and your colleagues make in this budget will shape the future of our region and our state,” the letter stated. “We urge you to stand with the people in Franklin County and across Ohio by passing a budget that provides some relief to families with young children.”
The letter cited recent research by child advocacy group (and letter supporter) Groundwork Ohio, who found in a poll of parents that 94% saw remedies to inflation and the cost of living as important concerns, and 84% of parents wanted to see reductions in the cost of child care.
A separate analysis of the child tax credit done in February by Scioto Analysis found that the tax credit, which would be paid for using an increase in the state tobacco tax, would benefit the state economy to the tune of more than $700 million.
Proposed Ohio child tax credit would produce $740M benefit to state economy, analysis finds

Democrats in the Ohio legislature are supportive of the tax credit (and think child care should be a priority), while Republicans have expressed hesitation in moving forward with the plan. Senate President Rob McColley seemed cautious when discussing raising taxes on cigarettes, saying it will be “a declining source of revenue.”
If passed, it could be the first time a GOP-controlled state implemented such a child tax credit, with Indiana also considering such a move.
On the side of child care, Republicans seemed to be more on board with the idea of improvements. Legislation to improve the child care sector has been introduced from both sides of the aisle, with the support of not only child care advocates but business groups and economic experts as well.
A bill to establish a cost-sharing model for child care called the Child Care Cred Program drew supporters to a House committee hearing on the bill this month. Businesses and the Ohio Chamber of Commerce urged support for the bill to help lift the parental load but also give the state workforce a boost. T
he legislation, and its companion bill in the Ohio Senate, are both led by GOP sponsors, making them more likely to succeed in a General Assembly over which Republicans hold a supermajority.

(Photo from Google Maps.)Ohio lawmakers plan to repeal the remaining aspects of scandal-tainted legislation, saving ratepayers money and eliminating FirstEnergy’s House Bill 6. As this happens, the utility company wants to increase consumers’ bills.
Like clockwork, energy costs go up in the winter.
“It’s been a long winter for us here in Ohio,” Clevelander John Makley said.
With a shaky economy and increasing FirstEnergy bills, Makley worries about his retirement.
“Do I have to manage to get to work and walk with a cane or a walker just to maintain a paycheck?” he asked.
FirstEnergy is now asking for even more money from the Public Utilities Commission of Ohio (PUCO) for a $190 million increase in their charges.
“Instead of a $190 million distribution rate increase, the FirstEnergy utilities should be getting a haircut,” Agency Director of the Office of Consumers’ Counsel (OCC) Maureen Willis said. “Consumers electric utility bills are already packed with soaring transmission costs and rising energy prices. Affordability remains a key issue for Ohio families and businesses.”
The OCC estimates that Cleveland Illuminating Company consumers will see a $13 price increase per month, Ohio Edison will have a $3 spike, and Toledo Edison a $1.50 increase.
Makley is already frustrated by his current energy bill.
Taking a look at his charges, in the fine print, there is a subsidy that requires ratepayers to fund two Ohio Valley Electric Corporation coal plants — one in Southern Ohio and one in Indiana. The main beneficiaries for OVEC are American Electric Power Company (AEP), Duke Energy and AES Ohio. Still, FirstEnergy collects payment for it.
But thanks to the lawmakers, his energy costs may go down soon.
“They’re thinking about the people and working to right a wrong that was put into the legislation so long ago,” Makley said.
To find out which rider (a utility surcharge) on his bill benefited the plants — since it wasn’t on the bill — we had to search through the 150-page document on FirstEnergy’s website about tariffs.
Still, there was no mention of OVEC under any of the riders. We reached out to the company to find out where it was — turns out it falls under a rider on page 146 with the “Legacy Generation Resource Rider.”
This handout was part of House Bill 6, corrupt legislation that landed former House Speaker Larry Householder in federal prison for 20 years.
How we got here
Back in 2019, Householder funneled $61 million worth of bribes in exchange for legislation to give FirstEnergy a $1.3 billion bailout, named H.B. 6, at ratepayers’ expense.
In March 2023, a jury found that Householder and former GOP leader Matt Borges, beyond a reasonable doubt, participated in the racketeering scheme that left four men guilty. Neil Clark, a lobbyist accused of bribery, died by suicide after pleading not guilty in 2021.
In late June that year, federal judge Timothy Black sentenced Householder to 20 years in prison. Borges got five years. Two defendants — Jeff Longstreth and Juan Cespedes — took plea agreements early on, helping the FBI, and are still awaiting their sentencing. The feds are asking for zero to six months for them.
Former FirstEnergy CEO Chuck Jones, former FirstEnergy Senior Vice President Michael Dowling, and former PUCO Sam Randazzo were all hit with state bribery charges. Each pleaded not guilty during their joint arraignment in mid-February 2024. They are accused of masterminding the corruption scheme.
In April 2024, Randazzo would become the second defendant accused in the scandal to die by suicide.
Recently, Householder’s attorney said his team plans to use their connection to President Donald Trump to try to get out of prison.
OVEC
This past month, the Ohio House passed H.B. 15, and the Senate passed S.B. 2 — similar energy bills — but both repealed the subsidies for the unprofitable plants.
“If we leave this OVEC portion in place, it’s going to cost our taxpayers hundreds of millions of dollars for a bill that was bought and paid for in the largest scandal in Ohio history,” state Rep. Josh Williams, R-Sylvania, said.
A study commissioned by the Ohio Manufacturers’ Association found that in 2024 alone, these subsidies cost ratepayers roughly $200 million. The company lost more than $100 million the same year, so consumers are paying for plants that aren’t profitable.
The subsidies may not seem like a lot every month, but they add up when inflation is high and people struggle.
You would be saving $1.30 and $1.50 per month, depending on your utility provider, according to the Energy News Network.
While the bill was passed overwhelmingly in each chamber, former House Speaker Jason Stephens, R-Kitts Hill, argued that it could cause people to lose jobs if the plants shut down.
“There are Ohioans who work at this plant for generations — their grandfathers worked there,” Stephens said.
The Ohio plant is in Stephens’s district, and the former leader prevented similar legislation from being heard in the last General Assembly.
He explained that in a previous G.A., part of H.B. 6 was repealed, but the lawmakers chose to keep the coal plant money. Then, in the 134th G.A., lawmakers passed H.B. 128 — which took out funding for nuclear power plants.
House Speaker Matt Huffman didn’t seem impressed by Stephens’s remarks.
“This money doesn’t go to Lawrence County to help that plant,” the speaker told reporters after the vote. “It goes in Duke’s checking account in Charlotte, North Carolina, and they decide over many states, not necessarily to spend any money.”
Only three lawmakers voted against it in the House — Stephens and state Reps. Don Jones, R-Freeport, and Latyna Humphrey, D-Columbus.
“I understand and respect your — the corruption that everyone wants to attach to House Bill 6,” Jones said. “I was here for House Bill 6 — it’s the lens in which you look at it through.”
He continued that his county has about 700 coal miners who rely on these plants.
“When Ohio makes a promise, whether we like the promise or not… We should honor that,” Stephens added.
“At whose expense?” Makley responded.
OVEC and the utility companies are lobbying for at least some grace period — a sliding ramp of two years for them to eliminate the subsidies.
“Ohio Valley Electric Company power plants have provided Ohioans with reliable power, helped make Ohio’s economic development possible and supported our nation’s security interests,” Scott Blake with OVEC and AEP said. “We continue to advocate for a reasonable timeline for transitioning the cost recovery for the OVEC plants and will work with policy makers as the legislative process continues.”
There is still a process before you could see your bills go down. Each chamber will have to agree on one policy, which is then sent to the governor.
Gov. Mike DeWine in January said, when asked, that he would support repeal.
Asked what it would take to earn his trust back on energy policy in Ohio, Makley said that’s a tough one.
“Transparency is really important,” he said. “We need to see what we’re paying for.”
The lawmakers who support it say they are hoping to close this dark chapter in state history.

(Getty Images)Millions of individuals in this country rely on Medicaid. Poor Medicaid: To me Medicaid is like a person who gets beat up on all the time. No one quite understands what to do with Medicaid, or what rules or laws to implement with it.
Hospitals rely heavily on Medicaid payments, and so do nursing homes. Doctors’ offices and mental health clinics such as Valeo rely on Medicaid as well. When Medicaid was privatized in Kansas and became known as KanCare, put into three for-profit companies, problems abounded. It became especially problematic for those with developmental and intellectual disabilities.
Now, in the U.S. Congress, there is debate about changes and cuts to Medicaid. It’s all very confusing, but the bottom line is all of it would harm the Medicaid program. The people who rely on Medicaid are not criminals. They are not entitled and trying to get something for nothing. These are people who truly can’t work and who may need Medicaid for the remainder of their lives.
With Medicaid, people can thrive in their communities and receive lifesaving care and support. Do we care about these folks? Do we care about preserving our hospitals like K.U. Medical Center and the nursing homes where our loved ones reside? Whenever I think of asking tough questions, I always go back to my own faith and ask the question: “What Would Jesus Do?”
Indeed, now is the time for Congress to ask this question and to search deep within their hearts for the answers to all of these pressing issues.
Valeo Behavioral Health Care has faced budget cuts due to changes and cuts in Medicaid funding. They work with the three managed care companies administering KanCare, and it has been and continues to be a tremendous challenge.
Families know what is best for their children. It’s easy to say, “Let’s have cuts and harmful cuts to Medicaid,” when one doesn’t have a disabled family member or friend or anyone they know who relies on Medicaid. Disabilities are not the enemy. Poverty shouldn’t be the enemy.
I think a lot of people are afraid of the needs of others. They feel overwhelmed and burdened by what they don’t understand. Let’s imagine if Jesus walked into the U.S. Congress and sat down with all the lawmakers. What would He say to them? Who would He advocate for?
Families are crying out for help and greater funding of Medicaid and not greater burdens. Let’s listen to their cries and not turn away. Let’s not create burdens for people who are already about to give up.
When I see people in need, I often feel overwhelmed, but I don’t ignore that person. Instead, I ask my deep faith what to do. My grandpa, who was a minister for 60 years, used to always end his phone calls with me by saying kindly: “Rebecca, stay on the road.”
With all the drama and trauma going on these days, I would implore Congressional leaders to not ignore these families with loved ones who need Medicaid. I would encourage them to imagine stepping into my grandpa’s summer kitchen — in the back of his old, huge, historic home in Americus, Georgia — and listen to him encourage them to stay on the road, to stick to their values no matter what.
Let’s not give up on the right thing to do. Let’s reach out during this time and dare to care. It’s the only thing to do.

(Photo by David DeWitt, Ohio Capital Journal.)Last fall, heading into the final stretch of a uniquely traumatizing presidential election year, I worried about us. I feared we were adapting to abnormal, becoming desensitized to appalling and shrugging off horrific. 
Like the metaphorical frogs in a pot of water on slow boil, we were simmering in the surreal, lulled into complacency as a coping mechanism. Now we’re sitting in a fully boiling cauldron clamped shut and I worry that the speed and scale of our impending fate doesn’t even register with many of us.
Democracy in Ohio is being boiled away by corruption, extremism, and attacks on voters

But there’s still time to escape the intense autocratic heat in America and reclaim our sovereignty. The first step to saving our right to self-determination is awareness. The authoritarian regime in Washington mirrors the authoritarian regime in Ohio. One-party rule in our state government ignores court orders, voter mandates and overwhelming public opposition to muddled, catastrophic policy. 
In our federal government, a convicted felon seizing unilateral control of everything under compliant one-party rule, ignores court orders on due process, congressional mandates and immense public outcry over reckless agency shutdowns, blanket firings, and unchecked data mining by an unelected billionaire.   
The DeWine administration replicated the bullying and financial extortion of universities and colleges in the Trump administration to crush academic independence and chill speech. 
Ohio’s profile-in-cowardice governor even mimicked Trump’s performative signings of executive orders by posing with his own signature on ruinous state legislation designed to own the libs and teach “woke” public universities and colleges a right-wing lesson on cancel culture and funding cuts.
When Gov. Mike DeWine made the fiercely opposed Ohio Senate Bill 1 law — prohibiting all diversity, equity and inclusion activities on campus and setting regulations around “controversial” issues — he also sanctioned SB1’s anti-union edict to rescind certain collective bargaining rights and tenure protections for faculty no longer allowed to strike. 
The state’s union-busting rule followed Trump’s executive order that abolished union rights at over two dozen federal agencies.
As the powerbrokers in Columbus and Washington sync their agendas to control and subjugate, they are laser focused on removing whatever stands in their way — chiefly, free, fair and accessible elections. 
Undermining them is a coordinated MAGA goal of the utmost priority before the 2026 midterms. To that end, Trump recently issued a sweeping executive order dictating the law of the land on federal elections — which he has no constitutional authority to do — that could stop millions of Americans from registering to vote in federal elections if they don’t have proof of citizenship (which many don’t or can’t easily access). 
Voters already attest to their citizenship under penalty of perjury. The added hurdle is purely to suppress votes, especially those that trend Democratic.
Trump’s directive severely limits voting by mail and gives more uncurbed power to Elon Musk’s DOGE to comb through sensitive state voter files. What could go wrong? 
Unrestrained voter purges. Database errors. Leaks. It’s all good if it keeps voters from holding unlawful leaders to account. 
Trump’s allies in Congress have teed up a nearly identical voter suppression scheme called the Safeguard American Voter Eligibility (SAVE) Act.
It could block more than 21 million eligible Americans from voting because they’re unable to supply a birth certificate or passport or enhanced driver’s license or jump through more gratuitous GOP hoops for permission to vote.
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
U.S. House Republicans are expected to consider their massive barrier to voting this week. It would require everyone registering to vote or updating their registration to prove their citizenship. Mail, online, and voter registration drives would be functionally eliminated because of the new, in-person, show-us-your-papers requirements.
This is a full court press by GOP lawmakers on the federal and state level to stay in power by disenfranchising active voters with the Trumpian-fueled myth of rampant voter fraud. 
Ohio Republicans are quietly rolling out legislation now that would also reduce participation at the polls. As always, they justify their so-called anti-fraud measures as election “integrity” insurance — even as they boast of our “gold standard” election system and can’t produce evidence of a problem. Ever. 
A bill was just introduced in the Ohio Senate (SB 153) that would require proof of citizenship to vote in the state and ban ballot drop boxes altogether because why not?
State Sen. Theresa Gavarone, R-Bowling Green, obsessed with dreaming up new ways to solve a phantom dilemma (a post-election audit last November showed a perfect accuracy rate and no voter fraud in the presidential race in Ohio) touted SB 153 as “a simple fix that strengthens trust and integrity in our institutions.” 
She posted her enthusiasm for Trump’s sham executive order that attacks free and fair elections. “President Trump is right; we need to do everything to protect the integrity of our elections.” 
Poor thing must have amnesia about Trump’s lawless attempt to overturn a free and fair election, his blatant lies about a stolen election that wasn’t, and his incitement of a violent attack on the seat of our democracy to stay in power. 
We are in boiling hot water. The only way out is with eyes wide open. Then you have to decide whether you care enough to exercise your fundamental rights with resolve and not a minute to spare.

For many California residents, the Los Angeles wildfires earlier this year were the latest and most searing example of the devastating effects of climate change. Some estimates have pegged the damages and economic losses from the fires at more than $250 billion.
“We’ve had disaster after disaster after disaster,” said Assemblymember Dawn Addis, a Democrat. “It’s the taxpayers and the insurance ratepayers that are bearing the cost. It’s not sustainable, it’s not right and it’s not ethical.”
Addis and Democratic lawmakers in nearly a dozen other states want to force the world’s largest fossil fuel companies to help pay for the recovery costs of climate-related disasters. Last year, Vermont became the first state to pass a “climate Superfund” law, followed soon after by New York.
This session, 10 states have seen similar proposals, several of which have advanced in key committees. Advocates point to legislation in Maryland that has drawn support in both chambers, as well as to strong grassroots support in California after the Los Angeles wildfires.
Lawmakers say the rapidly increasing cost of climate disasters — from wildfires to floods to sea level rise — is more than state budgets can bear.
“Climate Superfund is the ‘it girl’ policy of the [2025] session,” said Ava Gallo, climate and energy program manager with the National Caucus of Environmental Legislators, a forum for state lawmakers. “There’s a lot of popularity in the idea of holding polluters responsible.”
The momentum for these “polluter pays” bills is tied to the maturation of attribution science. That new field of research can help calculate fossil fuel companies’ contributions to historic emissions totals, as well as the role climate change played in causing or worsening natural disasters.
Vermont’s law was the first attempt to use that science to charge emitters for their role in causing devastating floods and other catastrophes.










We've had disaster after disaster after disaster. It's the taxpayers and the insurance ratepayers that are bearing the cost. It's not sustainable, it's not right and it’s not ethical.


– California Democratic Assemblymember Dawn Addis


Fossil fuel companies and their allies have fought back hard. Late last year, the American Petroleum Institute and the U.S. Chamber of Commerce filed a lawsuit challenging Vermont’s measure. The groups argue that emissions are governed by the federal Clean Air Act, precluding states from charging companies over global pollution.
Neither group responded to a Stateline interview request. The Independent Petroleum Association of America also declined an interview request.
A separate lawsuit, led by 22 Republican attorneys general, is challenging the New York law. And a conservative group has targeted Rachel Rothschild, an assistant professor of law at the University of Michigan Law School, who helped draft the legal justification for climate Superfund policy. The group, Government Accountability and Oversight, has sought to subject Rothschild to a deposition, The New York Times reported, a move that some experts view as an intimidation tactic.
Meanwhile, oil and gas executives asked President Donald Trump during a White House meeting this month to direct the Justice Department to join the legal fight against climate Superfund laws, The Wall Street Journal reported. Industry leaders are also pushing Congress to shield them from more than 30 lawsuits brought by state and local governments that aim to make them pay for some of the results of climate change.
While experts expect a bruising legal battle over climate Superfund policies, the threat of lawsuits hasn’t deterred more lawmakers from backing the concept.
“States were a little bit wary; they wondered, ‘Is this some new radical plan?’” said Cassidy DiPaola, communications director with the Make Polluters Pay campaign, a coalition of groups backing such bills. “Then one of the littlest states passed it and this powerhouse, New York, passed it. That really set the ball rolling.”
Lawmakers hope to use this emerging climate science to charge oil companies for disasters

Fossil fuel companies have cast doubt on attribution science. They also note that their production of oil and other products was done legally under U.S. and international regulations.
“Manufacturers will see this as a shakedown of any industry you don’t like at some point in the future, even though in the past they were licensed and operated under government regulation,” Brett Vassey, president and CEO of the Virginia Manufacturers Association, said during legislative testimony about a climate Superfund proposal in that state. “It will have a chilling effect on Virginia being able to grow its economy.”
Proponents of Superfund legislation point to legal settlements with large tobacco companies in the 1990s. Although those companies also sold their products legally, they were held responsible because they knew about the harmful effects of those products and deceived the public. Most climate Superfund proposals target companies for their emissions over the past 30 or so years, after leading experts had documented the dangers of greenhouse gases.
“There’s good documentation of how well the fossil fuel industry knew the probable long-term impacts of their product,” said Oregon state Sen. Jeff Golden, a Democrat. “Should an industry that made such historic profits over a period of time and made so many representations that we had no problem not bear any of the costs?”
Golden and other lawmakers say it’s becoming impossible for taxpayers to cover the costs of recovery from wildfires and other catastrophes. In Rhode Island, sea level rise is causing massive damage for coastal communities, said Democratic state Rep. Jennifer Boylan, who has sponsored a climate Superfund bill to help the state adapt.
Some advocates also note that Trump’s return to the White House has cut off the possibility of federal climate relief.
“All the states are affected by the disappearance of this federal funding,” said Gallo, of the state lawmakers group. “States everywhere are going to be looking at some way to fill the gap.”
This session, climate Superfund bills have been introduced in California, Connecticut, Hawaii, Maryland, Massachusetts, New Jersey, Oregon, Rhode Island, Tennessee and Virginia.
After a long slog, climate change lawsuits will finally put Big Oil on trial

While the bills are structured differently, they all seek to target the largest polluters — often covering companies that produced 1 billion metric tons of emissions over the last 30 or so years. Lawmakers say that applies to roughly 100 companies.
The measures also take different approaches to assigning damages. Some direct state agencies to conduct complex studies to determine the costs of climate-caused disasters over a certain period, the approach pioneered by Vermont. Others set a fixed number that represents a conservative baseline for those damages. New York’s law set that figure at $75 billion over a 25-year period.
Many of the bills also require that significant amounts of the funding be directed to the communities hit hardest by pollution.
Advocates are particularly optimistic about the measures in California and Maryland.
Lawmakers in Maryland modified their bills to commission a study about the financial impacts of climate change. Those measures passed both the House and Senate, and legislators are working to reconcile the versions from each chamber. Figures produced by the study would be the backbone of a climate Superfund policy in a future session.

“From a legislative perspective, it’s a shot in the dark as to what the costs are,” said Democratic Del. David Fraser-Hidalgo, who sponsored one of the bills. “This will give us the factual data needed to make a more well-educated decision on policy.”
In New Jersey, an Assembly committee advanced a climate Superfund bill this month. State Sen. Bob Smith, a Democrat who chairs the Environment and Energy Committee and who sponsored the bill, said it will help to rebuild and fortify water treatment plants, schools and firehouses. He noted that Trump has called for the dismantling of the Federal Emergency Management Agency.
“The end of the world is coming; it’s kind of hard to ignore,” Smith said. “FEMA has been the backstop to help communities recover from disasters. If the handwriting isn’t on the wall to all the states that they’ve got to deal with this, shame on them.”
Lawmakers in many states have heard from mayors and other local government leaders that more climate recovery funding is essential.
“Municipal officials are getting behind [climate Superfund policies],” said Massachusetts state Sen. Jamie Eldridge, a Democrat who has sponsored similar legislation. “They’re facing the costs of flooding, of droughts, of heat waves, and really asking for relief.”

Photo by Georgia Department of Corrections/Getty ImagesGeorgia is the only state with the death penalty that requires defendants to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that they are intellectually disabled to be spared execution – a high legal standard that no one charged with intentional murder has cleared.
But that would change under a bill that is now sitting on Gov. Brian Kemp’s desk that would lower the standard of proof. 
Advocates have pushed for the change for two decades, but a south Georgia lawmaker, Glennville Republican state Rep. Bill Werkheiser, was able to convince his colleagues that the state’s law was incompatible with the constitution’s prohibition against executing people who are intellectually disabled.
Werkheiser often pointed to a 2021 Georgia Supreme Court case where a judge wrote in a dissenting opinion that using the highest possible burden of proof increases the risk that someone with an intellectual disability is executed.
House Bill 123 lowers the standard of proof for proving someone has an intellectual disability to a preponderance of the evidence, ending Georgia’s outlier status as the only state that requires beyond a reasonable doubt. 
The measure also creates a pre-trial hearing where a judge would focus only on the question of whether the defendant is intellectually disabled. Today, a jury is determining whether a defendant is intellectually disabled at the same time they are hearing grisly details about the alleged crime and deciding the person’s guilt or innocence.
The bill was changed in the Senate to require 60 days of information sharing between the prosecution and defense before the newly created pretrial hearing. Prosecutors had fought the pretrial hearing, arguing it was adding another step in an already lengthy legal process.
And it also now requires defendants who prove they are intellectually disabled but are found guilty will be sentenced to life in prison or life without the possibility of parole. Defense attorneys and others opposed adding life without the possibility of parole as an option. 
“A life sentence in Georgia must be served for a minimum 30 years before a person can even be considered for parole, and that’s considered, not necessarily released,” Mazie Lynn Guertin, executive director and policy advocate with the Georgia Association of Criminal Defense Lawyers, said to lawmakers last month.
The bill sailed through the Senate Monday and was finalized by the end of the day in the House. The proposal also drew support from Catholic groups and a tag-team advocacy effort from the Georgia Council on Developmental Disabilities and Georgians for Alternatives to the Death Penalty. 
The Southern Center for Human Rights, which has long advocated for changes to Georgia’s law, celebrated the bill’s passage Monday and is already planning the party. 
“This change will put Georgia in line with twenty-six other states that have protections for people with intellectual disability,” said Terrica Redfield Ganzy, the center’s executive director. “We are deeply grateful to Chairman Werkheiser for his compassion and leadership on this issue. It is our honor to partner with him on this effort.”
Werkheiser, who chairs the House Industry and Labor Committee, has developed a special interest in the state’s prison system and the people involved in it, recently visiting all the state’s prisons. He sponsored a version of the bill last year that went nowhere and spent the last year working to work through reservations about the changes. 
He thanked House leadership and the lawmakers in the committees who spent time this session getting the bill done.
“There were so many advocacy groups that joined along the way that were not only encouraging, but provided assistance in so many ways. It was a team effort from so many,” Werkheiser said Monday.
