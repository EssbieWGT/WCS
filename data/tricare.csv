The original counties affected were Bartholomew, Brown, Clark, Crawford, Dearborn, Delaware, Gibson, Hamilton, Harrison, Lake, Madison, Marshall, Martin, Owen, Perry, Posey, Spencer, and Warrick. For beneficiaries in these counties, the date to receive emergency prescription refills has been extended from April 24 to April 25.

Additionally, DHA has expanded the list to include Clay, Elkhart, Floyd, Greene, Hancock, Hendricks, Jefferson, Jennings, La Porte, LaGrange, Morgan, Porter, Shelby, Steuben, Switzerland, Vigo, and Washington counties.

To receive an emergency refill of prescription medications, TRICARE beneficiaries should take their prescription bottle to any TRICARE retail network pharmacy. If the bottle is unavailable or the label is damaged or missing, beneficiaries should contact Express Scripts, Inc., or their retail network pharmacy for assistance.

To find a network pharmacy, beneficiaries may call Express Scripts at 1-877-363-1303, or search the network pharmacy locator.

If possible, visit the pharmacy where the prescription was filled. Prescriptions filled by a retail chain may be filled at another store in that chain. If the clinician who prescribed the medication is available, beneficiaries can ask them to call in a new prescription to any network pharmacy.

As a reminder, TRICARE beneficiaries, other than active duty service members, may receive urgent care from any TRICARE-authorized urgent care center or provider and do not need a referral. This allows beneficiaries to seek nonemergency care for illnesses or injuries if their primary care provider is unavailable because of emergencies. Any TRICARE beneficiary who reasonably believes they have an emergency should always call 911 or, go to the nearest emergency room.

Beneficiaries are advised to visit Express Scripts’ Weather Notices page for updates.

In this article, we will summarize the bulls’ thesis on GRAL. GRAIL, Inc. (GRAL)’s share was trading at $25.93 as of April 15th.

Grail, the undisputed leader in multi-cancer early detection (MCED), was spun off from Illumina in June 2024 following antitrust pressures in Europe, despite Illumina acquiring it for $8 billion in 2020. The spin-off, which left Illumina with a 14.5% stake, included a $775 million cash infusion—enough for a 2.5-year runway—making Grail’s current market cap roughly equal to its net cash. Its flagship product, Galleri, is a breakthrough blood test capable of detecting up to 50 types of cancer—many of which have no routine screening options—using machine learning to identify cancer-specific methylation patterns in cell-free DNA. Initial results from the PATHFINDER study were promising, and three major trials are underway: the 140,000-person NHS-Galleri trial in the UK, the 20,000-person PATHFINDER II trial with Medicare, and the REFLECTION study via the VA, which led to Tricare coverage for at-risk individuals over 50. The NHS and Medicare trials, with results expected in late 2025 and 2026, could trigger broad reimbursement approval. A successful Medicare rollout alone—at a $300 reimbursement per test, 30% adherence, and one test every two years—could drive $2.25 billion in sales, implying an $11 billion valuation at 5x sales. That’s a potential 14x return from today’s levels, with minimal market awareness.

As per our database, 28 hedge fund portfolios held GRAL at the end of the fourth quarter which was 25 in the previous quarter.

It’s a good thing Dr. Edward Simmer is a psychiatrist.

Any other kind of physician might have been baffled last week when the S.C. Senate Medical Affairs Committee voted 12-5 to reject his gubernatorial nomination to lead the state Department of Public Health.

After all, his credentials are nothing short of spectacular: 30 years as an active duty Navy doctor. Chief medical officer of TRICARE, where he oversaw care for millions of service members, veterans and families. And since 2021, the director of the former state Department of Health and Environmental Control and then interim director of public health right here in South Carolina, garnering valuable state experience and winning the trust of Gov. Henry McMaster, who nominated him last November.

So, yes, most doctors are probably mystified by the committee’s rejection. But not Simmer, who sat patiently as one senator after another condemned his record of recommending — not mandating, just recommending — masks and vaccines during the Covid pandemic that killed 19,000 people in the Palmetto State.

As a trained mental health professional, he must have known exactly what was going on: The inmates were running the asylum.

“What you’re asking us to do is have confidence in your judgment to do this job,” said hard right Sen. Matt Leber (R-Charleston), after attacking Simmer for supporting voluntary masking and vaccination. “And the history of it, uh, I’m not confident.”

Simmer, ever the gentleman throughout the hearing, respectfully reminded the senator that under his leadership, the state consistently followed the best available science — even when it was at odds with the advice coming from federal officials.

That’s why Palmetto State schools were allowed to reopen in August 2020, well before most. And it’s why our public health authorities did everything in their power to help S.C. businesses keep their doors open throughout the crisis.

But Republicans on the committee made it clear that they weren’t going to be dragged into a tedious conversation about facts and science. Humbug! Not when the only medical research S.C. public health officials should ever concern themselves with was published and peer reviewed by the states in 1787.

“We didn’t have all the information,” Sen. Tom Fernandez (R-Dorchester) told Simmer. “We had the United States Constitution, we had personal liberty, we had personal freedom. That’s the best information at any time of any emergency.”

Of course, Fernandez offered no evidence that Simmer had ever violated the Constitution. But no matter. Vibes, not substance, were the order of the day when Simmer faced these lemmings and accusers.

To his credit, McMaster stood by his man after the vote, urging the full Senate to override the committee.

“I remain resolute in my support of Dr. Ed Simmer and am hopeful that the full Senate will see through the falsehoods and mistruths being spread about his service to our state and nation,” McMaster said in a social media post.

Still, the prognosis for Simmer’s nomination is grim, with one senator suggesting he’d be better off looking for work in the Department of Mental Health.

Which, inevitably, put us in mind of the most famous words ever uttered about the Palmetto State, offered by Charleston attorney James L. Petigru on the eve of secession in 1860.

“South Carolina,” he noted, “too small for a republic, but too large for an insane asylum.”

The CAM and the M18A2 indicated the possible presence of mustard agent; the one-color detector paper turned brown denying presence of mustard agent, and the three-color detector paper changed colors but did not confirm mustard agent.
The container would be useful to the United Nations efforts because if the container did contain chemical warfare agent, it would demonstrate Iraq's forward deployment of bulk chemical warfare agent.
[152] Chemical warfare agent (CWA) A chemical warfare agent is a chemical substance used in military operations to kill, seriously injure, or incapacitate through its physiological effects.
[185] M256 chemical warfare agent detector kit In the field, the M256-series chemical warfare agent detector kit is simply referred to as the M256 kit.","In early August 1991, personnel from Passive Barriers Limited, a British explosive ordnance firm, discovered a storage tank believed to contain chemical warfare agent next to the perimeter wall of the Kuwaiti Girls' School in Kuwait City, Kuwait. Witnesses described the tank as emitting brown vapors through two bullet holes in the tank. Initial field tests suggested the possible presence of mustard agent, but the results were inconclusive. American and British military personnel conducted four operations in August 1991 to determine if the tank contained chemical warfare agent and to permanently seal the holes in the tank.

Maj. Jonathan Watkinson, commander of the 21st Explosive Ordnance Disposal Squadron, British Royal Engineers, commanded joint British and American operations to identify the contents of the tank. He used several types of chemical warfare agent detection equipment including a Chemical Agent Monitor, both one- and three-color chemical warfare agent detector papers, and an M18A2 chemical warfare agent detection kit. The Chemical Agent Monitor registered 8 bars, a positive result, for mustard agent. The chemical warfare agent detector papers and the M18A2 kit produced inconclusive results. After Major Watkinson's initial tests, two Fox nuclear, biological, and chemical reconnaissance vehicles sent to the girls' school initially alerted for the possible presence of the chemical warfare agents mustard and phosgene. MM-1 initial alerts, however, do not verify the presence of chemical warfare agents. The Fox crews took additional steps, known as spectrum analyses, that disproved the initial results of mustard and phosgene but indicated the presence of an unknown substance.

To confirm the presence or absence of chemical warfare agents in the tank, a British sampling team extracted liquid from the tank for laboratory analysis. The samples remained in the custody of the sampling team or an authorized individual until delivered to the Chemical and Biological Defence Establishment at Porton Down, United Kingdom. The United Nations had designated the laboratory at Porton Down as a preeminent authority to analyze samples of chemical warfare agents sent from Iraq. Scientists at the Chemical and Biological Defence Establishment produced an initial report on the laboratory analyses of the samples taken from the tank. Their 1991 initial report stated that the samples were consistent with the tank containing nitric acid and there was no evidence of any chemical warfare agent in the tank.

In 1994, the tank found at the Kuwaiti Girls' School became a focus of government and media scrutiny in the U.S. and the United Kingdom when veterans and the general public feared possible exposure of soldiers to chemical warfare agents. The American public and Gulf War veterans suspected Iraq's chemical warfare agent inventory could be a possible cause of reported undiagnosed illnesses in Gulf War veterans. A contemporary press article that appeared in the British newspaper, The Sunday Observer, reported the 1991 discovery of a container full of mustard agent in Kuwait City, Kuwait. The U.S. Senate Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs launched an investigation to determine if in fact the tank contained a chemical warfare agent, thus possibly exposing military personnel. The Senate committee reviewed documentation and interviewed U.S. military personnel who participated in the testing or sampling of the tank's contents at the Kuwaiti Girls' School. Although some of the initial results of Major Watkinson's field tests using various types of chemical detection equipment supported the Senate committee's conclusion that a chemical warfare agent may have been present in the tank, laboratory and Fox vehicle analysis did not. Despite the laboratory evidence to the contrary, the Senate committee disagreed with the DOD and concluded publicly that chemical warfare agent had been present in the storage tank. In the United Kingdom, parliamentary questions born out of the U.S. Senate committee's declaration have repeatedly been raised.

In 1997, the DOD commenced a joint investigation with the Ministry of Defence in the United Kingdom. This investigation revealed new evidence confirming the tank did not contain a chemical warfare agent, but most likely contained nitric acid. This evidence included copies of the two Fox vehicles' MM-1 mobile mass spectrometer tapes produced at the tank site on Aug. 9, 1991. Chemical experts at the Edgewood Research, Development, and Engineering Center, mass spectrum experts at the National Institute of Standards and Technology, and the manufacturer of the MM-1 mobile mass spectrometer all analyzed the mass spectrometer tapes produced at the tank site. They concluded definitively that the tank did not contain chemical warfare agent, but indicated the presence of nitric acid.

The liquid samples extracted from the tank at the Kuwaiti Girls' School provide physical evidence that the tank did not contain chemical warfare agent, but did contain nitric acid, most likely inhibited red fuming nitric acid. We acknowledge that the tank probably did not contain pure nitric acid, but more likely contained a mixture of nitric acid and other unknown substances or contaminants as a result of exposure to the environment (for example, water, sand, and pollutants). The tank emitted brown-colored fumes, indicating the tank contained red fuming nitric acid, which is composed of nitric acid, water, and several forms of nitrogen oxide. We also believe the tank contained an inhibitor due to the lack of corrosion of the tank as described by eyewitnesses. However, because the liquid sample was not tested specifically for an inhibitor, we cannot confirm with certainty what inhibitor, if any, was in the tank. Therefore, we conclude that the tank contained nitric acid-most likely inhibited red fuming nitric acid. This chemical is an oxidizer used in Seersucker missiles that were maintained at the girls' school.

In March 1998, the DOD, in cooperation with the United Kingdom Ministry of Defence, published the initial report of our investigation of a suspicious metal storage tank, believed to contain chemical warfare agent, discovered next to the perimeter wall of a girls' school in Kuwait City, Kuwait, following the Gulf War. Although we have not received any new evidence concerning this investigation, the Presidential Special Oversight Board reviewed the narrative and recommended that we amend and republish it as a final report after incorporating additional clarifying information. Consequently, this report provides more detail and a more accurate discussion of the events at the Kuwaiti Girls' School and the evidence about the tank's contents.

1. Location and Identification of the Kuwaiti Girls' School

In early March 1991, Coalition forces in Kuwait explored the Al Badawiyah Girls' Sciences School in the Al Badawiyah suburb of Kuwait City at coordinates 2904N4806E (Universal Transverse Mercator grid TN18832039).[2] (Figure 2).[3] The Al Badawiyah Girls' Sciences School has several different names: The Sabahiyah High School for Girls[4] and the Ansarieh Banat Kebeed School.[5] The school falls within the Sabahiyah municipality and the Badawiyah district and thus may also be known by locality.[6] In 1997, the school was named the Al Nasser School for Secondary Curriculum (Figure 3). Since that time, the United Kingdom (UK) Parliament, the United States (US) Senate and Department of Defense, and the media have referred to the building as the Kuwaiti Girls' School. Thus, for consistency, this report refers to it as the Kuwaiti Girls' School.

2. Iraq's Use of the Kuwaiti Girls' School as Missile Maintenance Facility

During the Gulf War, Iraq used the Kuwaiti Girls' School as a missile test and maintenance facility. A March 29, 1991, initial intelligence report stated Coalition forces found six Chinese-made Seersucker missiles, mistakenly referred to as Silkworm missiles, inside the building at the Kuwaiti Girls' School. (Figures 4 and 5). The report also noted the presence of missile test carts, cabling, two abandoned Soviet missile transport trucks next to a truck-mounted crane 100 meters west of the school, and a Chinese generator positioned 600 meters west of the school.[7] The initial intelligence report did not refer to any missile fuel or oxidizer storage tank near the school, but photography taken on March 1, 1991, does show the tank at the school (Figure 6).

3. Clearance of Unexploded Ordnance in Kuwait

Although the U.S. Defense Intelligence Agency assessed before Operation Desert Storm that Iraq was ""likely to have a CW [chemical warfare] warhead for its Silkworms,""[8] the missiles discovered at the Kuwaiti Girls' School had conventional, high explosive warheads.[9] A report on captured military hardware dated September 12, 1991, stated that 30 Silkworm warheads to be sent to the United States in September/October of 1991 would be available for evaluation.[10] The Terra Group, New Mexico Institute of Mining and Technology, received 19 warheads, nine warheads went to the Naval Warfare Center, China Lake, California, and the last two went to the Naval Explosive Ordnance Disposal Technical Center at Indian Head, Maryland.[11] According to the head of security for the New Mexico Institute of Mining and Technology, the paperwork for all 19 warheads indicated they were all high explosive, not chemical-filled. A representative from the Naval Warfare Center, China Lake, California, reported the nine warheads his organization destroyed were all high explosive warheads. A representative from the Naval Explosive Ordnance Disposal Technical Center at Indian Head, Maryland, indicated that he had not heard of warheads for Iraq's Silkworms that could carry chemical warfare agents. He also reported the two warheads sent to Indian Head were conventional, high explosive warheads.[12]

Following the expulsion of Iraq's military forces from Kuwait, the government of Kuwait began to rebuild the infrastructure damaged during Iraq's occupation. To help the Kuwaiti government coordinate this mission, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers established the Defense Reconstruction Assistance Office (DRAO) and the Kuwait Emergency Recovery Office (KERO). However, unexploded ordnance located throughout Kuwait impeded the reconstruction efforts. The government of Kuwait issued contracts to Coalition nations to clear unexploded ordnance within Kuwait. They divided the country into six sectors to distribute the work among Coalition forces, specifically the UK, US, France, Egypt, Bangladesh, and Pakistan.[13]

Each country approached the ordnance disposal mission slightly differently. Egypt, Bangladesh, and Pakistan assigned the duties to their own soldiers, while France the UK and the U.S. used contractors to accomplish the task.[14] The United Kingdom retained Royal Ordnance, a British firm specializing in explosive ordnance, to clear its sector. In turn, Royal Ordnance hired British soldiers trained in ordnance disposal from the UK MoD.

In early August 1991, a British explosive ordnance firm, Passive Barriers, was subcontracted by Brown and Root International Inc., an American firm hired by the U.S. government to manage reconstruction projects in the sector designated to the US for infrastructure repair. As the Kuwaiti Girls' School fell within the U.S. sector of responsibility, Brown and Root were responsible for its repair. According to the Brown and Root supervisor, the protocol for the reconstruction effort called for Passive Barriers to clear the area before Brown and Root commenced work. While clearing the area around the Kuwaiti Girls' School, Passive Barriers personnel discovered the storage tank next to the exterior side of the perimeter wall surrounding the Kuwaiti Girls' School (Figure 7). Passive Barriers notified Brown & Root management, who then asked KERO to send someone to survey the tank and identify its contents so that it could be disposed of safely.

Assigned to support the KERO, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers safety officer conducted the initial inspection of the tank. His inspection revealed rust-colored fumes emitting through two holes in the tank (Figure 8), an amount he equated to that of a heavily smoking cigar. A bullet had pierced the tank, had broken in half on entry, and part of the bullet remained at the exit hole.

The safety officer reported that he heard that the tank contained mustard agent, but recalled thinking at the time the fumes smelled like nitric acid. He tapped the tank to determine the fill level; it was approximately one-third full. Despite not wearing protective gear and being close to the fumes, the safety officer reported no symptoms of exposure to chemical warfare agent. The rust color, the acid smell of the fumes, and his lack of symptoms akin to mustard agent exposure led the safety officer to believe the tank likely contained nitric acid.[15] The safety officer was the only person who identified the acid smell of the fumes. After the safety officer's inspection, all other inspections of the tank were conducted wearing protective clothing and respirators.

The safety officer verbally reported the findings of his inspection, conveyed his belief the tank contained nitric acid, and relinquished his pictures of the tank to the DRAO operations officer, but did not prepare a written report of his inspection.[16] Maj. Gen. Patrick Kelly, the DRAO commander, visited the tank site and ordered an inspection of the tank. He also requested Kuwait's Army Chief of Staff send a team to secure the area.[17]

Concerns about the possibility that the tank contained chemical warfare agent and an overlap in responsibilities resulted in four separate related operations to test the contents of the tank. The operations consisted of the following:

Maj. Watkinson's initial tests;

the Fox vehicle testing; and

sampling of the tank's contents; and

field tests of the liquid from the tank on the protective clothing.

Following this final operation, the holes in the tank were permanently sealed.

Communication regarding each of the operations was limited for several reasons. The same individuals did not participate in all four operations, and often these individuals were not aware of the other operations. An abbreviated listing of the major individuals and organizations involved in testing the tank's contents is at Tab E. Because of the multiple actions at the tank, some individuals ended their involvement with limited information and unanswered questions about the exact nature of the tank's contents. For graphical representations of what each participant knew about the events as well as a timeline, see Tabs F and G. Also, the sectors delineated for ordnance clearing did not correspond to the boundaries used for reconstruction efforts. The Kuwaiti Girls' School, while in the sector assigned to the U.S. for reconstruction, was in the British sector for ordnance clearing.[18] Therefore, the British commanded all operations to test the tank's contents with assistance provided by U.S. forces. The multi-national participation in these operations ultimately affected the promptness in which information flowed to participants.

On Aug. 5, 1991, Kuwaiti military officers tasked the British firm, Royal Ordnance, to examine the tank at the Kuwaiti Girls' School. On loan to Royal Ordnance specifically to conduct ordnance disposal operations, the 21st EOD Squadron, British Royal Engineers, commanded by Maj. Jonathan Watkinson, set out to investigate the tank. At the same time, a U.S. Brigadier General in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, tasked the commanding officer of the U.S. 146th EOD Detachment to investigate the tank, and expressed concern that the tank ""possibly contained mustard agent.""[19] In 1997, Maj. Watkinson described this assignment:

I attended a meeting on the 5th of August [1991] with the Kuwaiti Ministry of Defence which was a regular meeting, between Kuwaiti Army Officers and various agencies in Kuwait, who were involved in EOD operations. It was at that meeting that I first became aware of the container, because one of the Kuwaiti officers specifically asked Royal Ordnance if they could investigate it. A member of the Royal Ordnance management team was at that meeting and they immediately referred the problem to me to investigate, which I subsequently did...[20]

On Aug. 5, 1991, the commanding officer of the U.S. 146th EOD Detachment reported that he accompanied Maj. Watkinson to the Kuwaiti Girls' School to examine the tank and search the site for additional tanks and other suspicious items.[21] However, Maj. Watkinson does not recall any U.S. personnel being present during his initial testing of the tank, nor does he mention any U.S. personnel in his post-operation report. Maj. Watkinson's report mentions only the Bomb Disposal Engineer with him at the school on this occasion.[22]

At the Kuwaiti Girls' School, Maj. Watkinson located the metal storage tank outside the perimeter walls of the school. Maj. Watkinson described the tank as having a capacity of approximately 2000 liters.[23] No one informed Maj. Watkinson or any other individual sent to the school of the earlier assessment by the safety officer that, based on the color and smell of the fumes, the tank may have contained nitric acid.

Dressed in full individual protective clothing (Figure 9), Maj. Watkinson conducted several tests of the fumes emitting from the tank. He used several chemical warfare agent detectors including a Chemical Agent Monitor (Figure 10), British one-color detector paper (Figure 11), and an M18A2 kit (Figure 12).[24] Following standard practice, he limited the number of persons in the contaminated area, so the Bomb Disposal Engineer maintained radio contact at a safe distance from the tank and fumes.[25]

Maj. Watkinson first used the Chemical Agent Monitor to test the vapors. The CAM is a portable, hand-held instrument used to monitor the presence of nerve or blister agents.[26] Maj. Watkinson obtained a positive result for the presence of mustard agent when he used the CAM to test the vapors. It reflected eight bars, the highest possible reading for the presence of mustard agent. Maj. Watkinson did not know about a U.S. message dated Feb. 19, 1991, stating, ""Fuming nitric acid will drive the CAM to eight bars on the mustard scale."" This message originated following field tests where CAMs tested wreckage from a Scud missile that impacted near Hafir Al Batin, Saudi Arabia. The report warned operators that fuming nitric acid might cause the CAM to register a false positive for blister agent.[27]

After the CAM indicated the possible presence of mustard agent, Maj. Watkinson then tested the fumes with one-color detector paper. The paper produced no response. One-color detector paper is designed to analyze liquids, so we would not expect it to react when exposed to a vapor. Next, Maj. Watkinson extracted a small liquid sample from the tank by inserting a piece of wire through one of the bullet holes in the tank. He then wiped the wire on the one-color detector paper. If the liquid was a chemical warfare agent, the British one-color detector paper should have turned blue. However, the liquid turned the detector paper brown, a negative response for chemical warfare agent. The U.S. three-color detector paper also changes colors in the presence of chemical warfare agents: blister agent turns the paper red, G-series nerve agent turns the paper yellow, and V-series nerve agent produces a green color. When Maj. Watkinson tested the liquid on the three-color paper, the paper turned pink, which he believed signified a positive result for mustard agent.[28] Maj. Watkinson testified that ""Both the one color and three color detector paper changed color, but the colors weren't entirely appropriate with the color that I would have expected. So, that was a positive result, but with question marks.""[29]

The inconsistency in the test results using the CAM and detection papers led Maj. Watkinson to retest the tank's contents using an M18A2 chemical warfare agent detection kit. The M18A2 kit is a portable kit designed to test both liquid and vapors. Maj. Watkinson extracted vapors from the tank through glass tubes using a rubber bulb. He described the method he used with the M18A2 kit:

The M18A2 kit has glass tubes that contain sort of a cotton wool type substance, which is impregnated with certain chemicals. Obviously there are a whole series of different tubes, which are designed to detect for different agents. One can go through those tubes in sequence, in order to eliminate various chemicals and decide what it is you've got. I didn't go through that process fully, because I got a reading with the CAM and therefore I narrowed straight in on the H [mustard] agent.[30]

Maj. Watkinson tested the vapor six times using the M18A2 kit. In the presence of a chemical warfare agent, the kit shows distinctive color changes, specifically blue for mustard agent.[31] Four tubes changed colors to blue immediately; the remaining two tubes turned yellow initially, but turned blue some hours later.[32] Maj. Watkinson stated that, although the M18A2 detector kit produced a positive result, they were not as conclusive as he would have liked.[33]

1. Maj. Watkinson's Injury

While testing the sample extracted from the tank, Maj. Watkinson inadvertently came into contact with the liquid.

There was some of the liquid on the wire, which I then wiped onto the detector paper. I can only assume that in the process of doing that, I got some of the liquid onto the back of my thigh, and it went through my suit... It wasn't something that I was immediately aware of. In fact, it wasn't until I got back to the camp that evening that I noticed I'd been burnt. But it wasn't particularly painful; it was more a question of being uncomfortable.[34]

Maj. Watkinson noted that the burn on his thigh was just a red mark approximately 4 centimeters by 2.5 centimeters[35] and did not blister.[36] He received medical attention for the burn on Aug. 9, 1991, four days after he sustained the injury. According to the medical report, the burn did not blister but turned very red. The burn responded well to treatment with sulphadiazine cream[37] and completely healed within 7 to 10 days.[38] Maj. Watkinson provided the following statement about his injury:

The significance of the injury is...relevant, because I was dressed in all the full NBC [nuclear, biological, and chemical] protective equipment, and I at the time couldn't understand how I managed to get burned on a part of my body where there was no joint in the NBC clothing. The implication was that the chemical had gone through the NBC suit. This was a bit of a concern, because obviously our NBC suit was designed to protect us and clearly on this occasion it hadn't.[39]

Maj. Watkinson sealed both bullet holes with industrial silicone filler and plaster of paris bandages. He then checked the tank again for leaks using the CAM but found none.[40]

2. Maj. Watkinson's Initial Report

Despite conducting several tests using a CAM, an M18A2 kit, and one- and three-color detector paper, Major Watkinson was unable to identify with certainty the substance in the tank. The CAM and the M18A2 indicated the possible presence of mustard agent; the one-color detector paper turned brown denying presence of mustard agent, and the three-color detector paper changed colors but did not confirm mustard agent. Major Watkinson summarized the results of the initial test of the tank's contents as follows:

As far as I'm concerned, the CAM test was positive. It was eight bars on H. [mustard]. Both the one-color and three-color detector paper changed color, but the colors weren't entirely appropriate with the color that I would have expected. So, that was a positive result, but with question marks. The M18A2 detector kit gave test results, which again could have been interpreted as positive, but wasn't as conclusive as one would hope.[41]

Following his initial testing activities, Maj. Watkinson met with Kuwaiti and British military personnel, Col. John Macel, the Chief of the U.S. Office of Military Cooperation in Kuwait, and the chief of staff for U.S. Task Force Victory, Lt. Col. Donnie Killgore, to determine an appropriate course of action for disposition of the tank and its contents. The initial proposal was to transport the tank to an isolated location in the desert and destroy it. However, it was known that a United Nations chemical weapons evaluation team was in Iraq to inventory and assess Iraq's chemical weapons capability. The container would be useful to the United Nations efforts because if the container did contain chemical warfare agent, it would demonstrate Iraq's forward deployment of bulk chemical warfare agent. It was agreed to arrange for a UN team to take samples from the tank.[42]

At the same meeting, Lt. Col. Killgore suggested the Fox nuclear, biological and chemical reconnaissance vehicles assigned to the 11th Armored Cavalry Regiment test the tank's contents. Although the CAM and other chemical detection kits indicated the possible presence of a chemical warfare agent, the Fox vehicle's MM-1 mobile mass spectrometer is able to identify 60 known chemical warfare agents by their molecular composition and weight of ions.[43] Lt. Col. Killgore believed the Fox vehicle could more accurately assess the presence of chemical warfare agent in the tank.[44]

After Maj. Watkinson reported the results of his initial field tests, the commander of the U.S. 146th EOD Detachment received information that raised doubts that the tank contained mustard agent when representatives of the Kuwaiti Ministry of Defence and various agencies conducting ordnance disposal discussed the possibility that the tank may contain a highly reactive industrial chemical. Also, the 146th EOD commander showed a picture of the tank to an Egyptian EOD officer, reportedly trained in Soviet rocketry. The Egyptian officer told the commander that the tank at the Kuwaiti Girls' School was the same type used by the Soviets to store rocket fuel, but this conclusion was not documented.[45] Colonel Macel stated that he never received an EOD incident report or other assessment to suggest the tank did not contain chemical warfare agent.[46] As a result, the individuals conducting tests of the tank's contents were not aware of the possibility that the tank may have contained either industrial chemicals or rocket fuel.[47]

The Headquarters, Task Force Victory,[48] tasked the U.S. 54th Chemical Troop to send two Fox vehicles to support the 21st EOD Squadron, British Royal Engineers, at the Kuwaiti Girls' School.[49] Maj. Watkinson commanded the joint operation since the school was in the British sector for ordnance disposal. Capt. Michael F. Johnson, commander of the U.S. 54th Chemical Troop, directed the Fox vehicle operations.[50] Together, they received a mission brief on the previous field test results from Col. Macel, who was then briefed on the Fox vehicle capabilities. This operation was the first joint U.S. and UK chemical warfare agent detection operation using the Fox vehicles, so American and British personnel conducted mission rehearsals to minimize any operational differences.[51]

U.S. and UK forces arrived at the tank site on Aug. 9, 1991.[52] UK forces consisted of Maj. Watkinson, a Bomb Disposal Officer, a Bomb Disposal Engineer, and additional British soldiers who formed a command post and decontamination team. U.S. forces included Capt. Johnson, two Fox vehicles and crew, a decontamination unit, Task Force Victory's Chief of Staff, Lt. Col. Donnie Killgore, and Col. John Macel. A medical team was also present in case of an emergency.

During this operation, only the Fox vehicle crewmembers, the Bomb Disposal Officer, and the Bomb Disposal Engineer proceeded beyond the hot line, a designated line that separated the active operations area from the decontamination area (Figures 13 and 14). All other soldiers observed the operation from the safety of the incident command post or ICP approximately 200 meters north-northeast (upwind) of the hot line. Incident command post personnel did not wear protective suits during this operation.[53]

According to Maj. Watkinson, the Bomb Disposal Officer and the Bomb Disposal Engineer unsealed the bullet holes to extract liquid from the tank. Upon doing so, large quantities of vapor escaped from the holes for approximately two minutes before subsiding.[54] This suggested that the vapor pressure inside the tank had increased significantly since Maj. Watkinson sealed it two days earlier.

Using a long piece of rubber catheter tubing, the Bomb Disposal Officer and the Bomb Disposal Engineer extracted three liquid samples from the tank. The men transferred the samples into separate glass vials. They placed two vials in two separate brown glass bottles, one per bottle, in a steel ammunition box filled with fuller's earth, closed the ammunition box, and placed it next to the tank. They transferred the third sample to a stainless steel dish for Fox MM-1 analysis.[55] The liquid sample set aside for the MM-1 tests evaporated quickly. According to Maj. Watkinson,

One of the problems we were having was that the liquid, when put onto a stainless steel kidney tray, was evaporating quite quickly, and we hadn't anticipated this .… But nevertheless, mustard gas as I have dealt with it, seen it, and understand it, is fairly viscous, and I wouldn't have expected it to evaporate as quickly as it did. So, in my mind the rapid evaporation of the chemical was another indicator that suggested that this may not be mustard gas.[56]

While extracting the liquid from the tank, both the Bomb Disposal Officer and Bomb Disposal Engineer got some of the liquid on their rubber protective gloves. They noticed heat penetrating through their gloves and considered this a result of an exothermic chemical reaction-a release of heat due to contact between the liquid agent and the rubber gloves. The two men returned to the decontamination area and changed their gloves before continuing with the operation.[57]

Before the MM-1 tests began, the Fox crews severed communications between the two vehicles (vehicle C-23 and vehicle C-26) so as not to bias the test results.[58] Each crew maintained contact with Capt. Johnson. Because the third liquid sample evaporated, the Bomb Disposal Officer and Bomb Disposal Engineer extracted from the tank a fourth liquid sample and transferred it to the stainless steel dish.[59] Fox vehicle C-23 tested the sample first. C-23's MM-1 initially alerted to the possible presence of the choking agent phosgene. The MM-1 operator conducted another test-again the MM-1 initially alerted for the possible presence of phosgene.[60] The C-23 MM-1 operator then performed a spectrum analysis and printed the results to a hard copy tape for later analysis. With radio communications still disengaged, vehicle C-26 performed similar procedures. C-26's MM-1 initially alerted to the possible presence of phosgene as well as mustard agent. The C-26 MM-1 operator performed a spectrum analysis and printed the results. The hard copy tapes of the spectra results from both vehicles' MM-1s indicated the presence of an unknown substance (not phosgene or mustard).

After the Fox crews completed the MM-1 tests, the Bomb Disposal Officer and Bomb Disposal Engineer sealed the holes in the tank using luting, a quick drying putty, and plaster of paris strips. Once the plaster of paris hardened, they used a mixture of super tropical bleach and water to decontaminate the tank and the immediate area.[61]

An American sergeant first class, assigned to the 54th Chemical Troop, directed the Fox vehicle decontamination. He, along with the Bomb Disposal Officer, the Bomb Disposal Engineer, and the two British soldiers, formed the decontamination team.[62] The team, in protective garments, used CAMs to check the Fox vehicles for contamination, then proceeded to decontaminate the vehicles. The Bomb Disposal Officer and Bomb Disposal Engineer carried their equipment and the ammunition box to the emergency personnel decontamination station (EPDS) for decontamination. They sealed the box inside three large clear plastic bags with a label on the outer plastic bag. According to the Bomb Disposal Officer, they destroyed all the protective garments and other non-durable equipment used during the operation.[63]

Figure 13. Maj. Watkinson's sketch of UK and U.S. elements during the Fox testing. Figure 14. Photograph of Fox vehicle testing taken by a U.S. Army officer in charge of decontamination operations, 54th Chemical Troop. (Reprinted by permission).

While decontaminating the Bomb Disposal Officer and Bomb Disposal Engineer, the British lance corporal in charge of the EPDS felt a burning sensation on his right wrist. The lance corporal believed some of the liquid from the tank penetrated through his protective gear, so he decontaminated himself and removed his individual protective gear. The Bomb Disposal Officer described the circumstances of the injury sustained by the British lance corporal:

I was watching the EPDS party finishing the task from the CP [Command Post]. At the point when only the IC [lance corporal in charge] of the EPDS was left to decontaminate and undress himself he fainted (this I believe was due to the heat and the time spent in IPE [individual protective equipment]). Myself and another went to his assistance pouring vast quantities of water and decontaminant on his bare skin (arm), which was blistering. He was taken to a local … hospital [21st Squadron Medical Center]…[64]

In his report dated Jan. 4, 1994, Capt. Johnson stated that a British soldier (the British lance corporal) came into contact with a small amount of liquid from the tank while decontaminating the sampling team. The soldier reacted immediately, suggesting that the liquid penetrated the inner glove, suit and outer glove of his protective garments. According to Capt. Johnson, ""within one minute, we observed that the soldier had a small blister forming on his wrist the size of a stick-pin head. Five minutes later, the blister reached the size of a (US) half-dollar coin""[65] (Figure 15). Capt. Johnson's report indicated that the British soldier went into shock almost immediately, presumably due to extreme pain. An on-site medical team treated the lance corporal for a 3-mm blister on his wrist and heat stress.[66]

A doctor admitted the British lance corporal into the medical facility at Beteal Camp for one night. His medical report describes the injury and treatment he received:

The burn on his wrist was 0.5 x 1.0 cm in diameter, comprising an area of erythema with a centralized pinhead erupted zone. This injury is compatible with a variety of chemical or thermal insults ranging from contact with household disinfectants to perhaps more potent corrosive agents. The lesion did not propagate further, and responded quickly to silver sulphadiazine 1% (flamazine). The patient fully recovered from his heat exhaustion the following day and was fit to return to duty.[67]

Although the doctor said he had fully recovered, the lance corporal reported he did not return to duty until the following week. The lance corporal reported, ""the scab on my right wrist took some two to three weeks to heal, but a red mark remained for three to four months."" Furthermore, ""no one came to debrief me about the operation and I was not told about the likely effects of my exposure to the agent in the tank. During my time there, no tests were taken to see if I had been exposed to mustard agent. I was told not to speak to anyone about the incident.""[68] U.S. personnel who witnessed the events leading to the British lance corporal's injury reported that they received no information regarding his treatment or diagnosis.

Capt. Johnson provided the Fox MM-1 tapes to Lt. Col. Killgore, and all U.S. forces except the 54th Chemical Troop departed the area. The 54th Chemical Troop and the British 21st EOD Squadron guarded the tank and ammunition box to prevent any tampering with the samples in the ammunition box (Figure 16). The 54th Chemical Troop conducted its after-action review to recount events and evaluate operational procedures and equipment performance. Several hours later, military police from Task Force Victory arrived and took over the security detail of the tank and samples. The 54th Chemical Troop returned to Camp Doha where the results of the Fox vehicles' detection of chemical warfare agent were discussed with the regimental commander.[69]

After examining the Fox tapes, Lt. Col. Killgore decided that a laboratory with more sophisticated capabilities should analyze the Fox tapes. Upon his return to headquarters, he contacted the U.S. Army's Chemical Research, Development, and Engineering Center at Edgewood, Maryland. He faxed a copy of the Fox tapes and a description of the sampling and testing operations to CRDEC.[70] The Program Manager for NBC Defense Systems reportedly analyzed the Fox tapes;[71] however, we could locate neither the original fax from Lt. Col. Killgore nor the subsequent analysis of the tapes.

On Aug. 9, 1991, personnel at the United Nations Special Commission on Iraq in Bahrain were contacted by Maj. Watkinson and asked to inspect the tank at the Kuwaiti Girls' School.[72] In response, a British chemical weapons evaluation team arrived at the school to obtain samples from the tank.[73] The United Nations was not involved in the testing of the tank or taking any of the samples, and provided the following statement:

Although it is possible that the people involved in taking samples were at one time temporary UNSCOM inspectors, UNSCOM was not involved in the taking of samples from the tank at the Sabahiyah Girls' School in Kuwait. Chemicals in Kuwait are clearly not part of UNSCOM's purview, although UNSCOM does have interest in the contents of the tank as they probably originated from Iraq.[74]

On Aug.10, 1991, members of the sampling team met with British ordnance disposal personnel, Col. Macel, Lt. Col. Killgore, Maj. Watkinson, and a Kuwaiti army ordnance officer. Maj. Watkinson and Lt. Col. Killgore briefed the sampling team on earlier tests,[75] and provided the team with copies of the Fox tapes.[76] The sampling team interviewed key personnel, including Maj. Watkinson, the Bomb Disposal Officer, the Bomb Disposal Engineer, and the British lance corporal injured following the Fox vehicle tests.[77] The sampling team, accompanied by Col. Macel, Lt. Col. Killgore, Maj. Watkinson, and members of the 21st EOD Squadron, then traveled to the Kuwaiti Girls' School to collect the liquid samples from the tank.[78]

Upon arrival at the Kuwaiti Girls' School, the sampling team leader prepared the equipment needed for the operation. He labeled four tubes from a Sampling and Identification of Biological and Chemical Agents (SIBCA) kit in sequential order (Tab I). The tubes contained XAD-4 resin, a substance used by inspection teams to transport samples of chemical warfare agents.[79] The sampling team leader and another team member, along with Maj. Watkinson, put on full individual protective clothing before they approached the tank and ammunition box.[80]

The two sampling team members withdrew a sample from one of the bottles contained in the ammunition box using a glass syringe with a four-inch stainless steel internal tube. Then the sampling team selected one of the pre-prepared tubes containing XAD-4 resin at random and injected the sample into it through the rubber seal.[81] The first sample reacted violently when introduced into the tube, breaking both the tube and the syringe. The sampling team leader reported,

The original sample we were trying to take was onto an adsorbent, which is designed to take up chemical weapon agents. My theory, to which I still adhere, is that the nitric acid components reacted very quickly with the adsorbents and they gave off a gas, which just gave an enormous overpressure. So, the overpressure actually exploded the syringe.[82]

The violent reaction of the liquid sample on the XAD-4 resin caused doubts about the earlier assessment that the tank contained chemical warfare agent by the sampling team leader. The sampling team leader noted, ""Chemical warfare agents in general are not actually very reactive chemicals. They have specific organic receptors on which they have their effect. So, they're not reactive. Our sampling kit was designed to deal with CW agents, which, as I say, are not reactive, whereas, this of course was obviously a very reactive chemical.""[83] He later discussed the events at the school with colleagues in Bahrain, which further convinced him that the liquid in the tank most likely was fuming nitric acid.[84] The sampling team leader also reported:

My description of the liquid in the bottle was that it was of very low viscosity. Mustard is a very high viscosity liquid, similar to engine oil. On top of that, of course I had the descriptions of the injuries that [the British soldier] and Major Watkinson had suffered, and these were again inconsistent with mustard derived burns, but were wholly consistent with a powerful acid, such as nitric.[85]

When the tube broke during the sampling operation, a small amount of liquid agent possibly contaminated their protective gear. As a precaution, the sampling team conducted personal decontamination using hypochlorite solution and fuller's earth.[86] They withdrew from the contaminated area near the tank and went to the area established for personal decontamination. The team took a different approach the second time. Hoping to reduce the pressure in the tubes, they first removed the rubber seals from the screw top of the pre-prepared tubes and then placed a liquid sample onto the resin. The sampling team successfully deposited two samples in the tubes numbered 1 and 3.[87]

While observing the sampling team's activities, Maj. Watkinson noticed brown vapors once again escaping through the bullet holes in the tank. Once the sampling team completed its activities, Maj. Watkinson and the Bomb Disposal Engineer attempted to reseal the tank. Two members of the sampling team remained clothed in individual protective equipment to assist Maj. Watkinson. Maj. Watkinson removed the previous seals from the tank and used plaster of paris and chewing gum (no silicone sealant was available and the gum has similar properties to silicone sealant) to make new seals. After they resealed the tank, Maj. Watkinson, the Bomb Disposal Engineer, and the two sampling team members returned to the decontamination area.[88]

The sampling team sealed the liquid samples in suitable containers for transport (Figure 17) and established a chain of custody for control of the samples. The sampling team leader, Maj. Watkinson, and Col. Macel signed the seals on the containers to verify the samples were indeed those taken from the Kuwaiti Girls' School. The sampling team flew to Bahrain with the two tubes containing samples from the tank. The samples were treated as forensic evidence, so a signatory accompanied the samples at all times.[89] The sampling team relinquished custody of the samples to an individual from the UK Consulate to ship the samples to the Chemical and Biological Defence Establishment, Porton Down, UK,[90] the laboratory responsible for analyzing samples of chemical warfare agents collected in Iraq.

1. 1994 Investigation by the Senate Committee on Banking, Housing and Urban Affairs

In January 1994, Capt.Johnson noted the absence of a formal report on the participation of the 54th Chemical Troop in the events at the Kuwaiti Girls' School. He stated, ""he was concerned that it was possible that the history of my unit's chemical detection actions with the 21st EOD Squadron, British Royal Engineers, was not properly documented. I had not seen any official or unofficial record of those actions.""[110] Captain Johnson drafted a report for training purposes at the US Army Infantry School, Fort Benning, Georgia. His report focused on lessons learned in nuclear, biological, and chemical defensive operations during the Gulf War. He also described in detail the Fox vehicle operations at the Kuwaiti Girls' School. The U.S. Army Infantry School reviewed and authorized Capt. Johnson's report for use in future course instruction.[111]

The same year, the Senate Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs began investigating allegations of chemical warfare agent use during the Gulf War. In Senate hearings held later that summer, the events at the Kuwaiti Girls' School became a focus of public attention. After reviewing Captain Johnson's report, Senate investigators focused on three key issues:

the validity of the tests;

the physical characteristics of the liquid in the tank; and

the injury sustained by the British lance corporal during the sampling operations.

The committee staff highlighted the fact that multiple tests of the tank's contents by multiple types of chemical detection equipment initially produced positive results for chemical warfare agent. The Senate committee reported a total of 21 separate tests on the liquid in the tank.[112] It appears the committee counted the Fox alarms and their corresponding MM-1 mobile mass spectrometer spectrum analyses as separate tests.

Table 1 illustrates the type and number of tests conducted at the Kuwaiti Girls' School in August 1991, their respective results, and comments on the results.

Date of Test Type of Detector # of Tests Outcome Test Results Comments Aug. 5, 1991 Chemical Agent Monitor 2 Registered 8 bars on scale for mustard agent 8 bars is a very positive test, but field tests indicate nitric acid could cause false positive response for mustard agent. [113] Aug. 5, 1991 One-Color Detector Paper 2 Negative response One-color detector paper turns blue in the presence of mustard agent; the tank's liquid turned the paper brown. [114] Aug. 5, 1991 Three-Color Detector Paper 3 Pink; pink/orange, both possibly positive for mustard agent Paper should have turned red for mustard agent. IRFNA may cause a false positive for blister agent based on the theoretical reaction between the inhibitor and the dyes in the paper, but RFNA used in laboratory tests did not cause this reaction. [115] Aug. 5, 1991 M18A2 6 4 turned blue and 2 initially turned yellow but eventually turned blue According to Major Watkinson, the M18A2 tubes produced inconsistent responses for the presence of chemical warfare agent. [116] Aug. 9, 1991 MM-1 mobile mass spectrometer used on Fox Vehicles 4 Alarms received for mustard agent and phosgene

Spectra disproved these agents but identified an unknown substance with atomic mass unit 46 at 100% relative intensity, indicative of nitric acid[117] See later discussions.

In testimony before the Senate committee, scientists from the U.S. Army Chemical Research, Development and Engineering Center confirmed the earlier laboratory assessment by the Chemical and Biological Defence Establishment that the tank contained nitric acid. U.S. experts compared the mass spectrometer tapes to the mass spectrum of nitric acid, and the spectrum reportedly matched nitric acid in all four categories and in the correct proportions. However, this statement was incorrect; in truth, only a single peak, not three or four, would register for nitric acid on the Fox vehicle's MM-1. The American scientists assessed that the tank did not contain mustard agent or phosgene oxime.[118] The Fox MM-1 tapes (which we had not located at the time of the Senate investigation and the committee did not review) clearly show alarms only for mustard and phosgene agents, not phosgene oxime (Tab H).

U.S. DOD representatives provided the Senate committee inaccurate information on the laboratory procedures and test results of the liquid samples by the Chemical and Biological Defence Establishment. The Assistant Secretary of Defense for Chemical/Biological Matters mistakenly reported that the Chemical and Biological Defence Establishment analyzed pieces of the individual protective equipment worn by the injured British lance corporal.[119] In reality, the decontamination team burned the protective gear worn by the injured British lance corporal along with all other used individual protective equipment in accordance with standard procedures. Thus, the only tests of the tank's contents on the protective garments were those field tests conducted while on site at the Kuwaiti Girls' School.

In his report dated Jan. 4, 1994, Maj. (formerly Captain) Johnson stated that neither he nor any members of his unit had sufficient time to review the Fox tapes before relinquishing them to Lt. Col. Killgore.[120] Maj. Johnson stated he believed the tank most likely contained phosgene oxime, a blister agent, not phosgene, a choking agent, because of the severe burn and resulting blister sustained by the British lance corporal following the Fox vehicle tests.[121] In their final report, the committee accepted Maj. Johnson's theory and determined the British lance corporal's immediate reaction and burn due to contact with the liquid was consistent with exposure to phosgene oxime.[122] However, according to Lt. Col. Killgore, the tapes indicated the presence of phosgene and mustard, not phosgene oxime.[123]

DOD representatives strongly believed the tank did not contain chemical warfare agent, but rather inhibited red fuming nitric acid, but lacked the evidence to prove or disprove the initial test results. At the time of the Senate committee hearings, it appeared that there was no plausible explanation for the presence of inhibited red fuming nitric acid at the school, and the disposition of the tank was unknown. The DOD could not locate the original MM-1 mobile mass spectrometer tapes nor the Chemical and Biological Defence Establishment's 1991 initial report on the laboratory analysis of the samples. The Senate committee maintained that chemical warfare agent was present in the tank.[124]

All evidence presented by the British and U.S. military contradicting the possible presence of chemical warfare agent in the tank was dated 1994, rather than 1991,[125] raising concerns of a biased analysis. However, both the Senate committee and the DOD were unaware that the release of official information in the UK is governed by the non-statutory Code of Practice.[126] Under these provisions, the British government is obliged to provide information on its policies, actions and decisions; however, there is no commitment to the disclosure of pre-existing documents. Consequently, the British responded to the DOD's requests for information using information from original documents, but copies of the originals were not provided. The UK provided documents dated 1994, but when compared to the source documents dated 1991, the text is virtually identical. Unaware of these guidelines in the UK policy of public disclosure of information, the DOD could not convince the Senate committee that chemical warfare agent was not present in the tank.

Finally, the Senate committee raised questions regarding awards issued by the Department of Defense to members of the 54th Chemical Troop for discovering chemical warfare agents in Kuwait. If a chemical warfare agent was not present at the Kuwaiti Girls' School, as indicated by the initial report prepared by the Chemical and Biological Defence Establishment, then the DOD should not have made the awards. Reporters and authors suspicious of the Department's conclusions cited this apparent contradiction.[127]

2. 1997 Presidential Advisory Committee on Gulf War Veterans' Illnesses Investigation

In May 1997, President Clinton established the Presidential Advisory Committee on Gulf War Veterans' Illnesses to ensure an independent, open, and comprehensive examination of health concerns related to veterans service in the Gulf War. The Presidential Advisory Committee concluded the tank at the Kuwaiti Girls' School contained chemical warfare agent based on multiple positive detections reported by veterans and the lack of any contemporary analysis to the contrary.[128] In July 1997, officials from the UNSCOM testified before the Presidential Advisory Committee that inspections of Iraq's chemical weapons program produced no evidence that Iraq moved chemical weapons into Kuwait.[129] In September 1997, the DOD provided additional evidence that Iraq used the Kuwaiti Girls' School as a missile test and maintenance facility. The British also provided copies of the Fox tapes produced at the Kuwaiti Girls' School.[130] Despite the new evidence, the Presidential Advisory Committee did not amend its May 1997 conclusion that the tank contained a chemical warfare agent.

3. Public Attention in the United Kingdom

The UK press reported on the Senate committee investigation in October 1994. Articles in the British newspapers, Evening Standard and The Times, reported on the discovery of the tank and subsequent sampling operations at the Kuwaiti Girls' School. During the U.S. Senate investigation, Major Watkinson's initial report suggesting the liquid in the tank might be mustard agent was inappropriately released. The UK Ministry of Defence had not approved the public release of this document. The articles also quoted Maj. Johnson's testimony to the U.S. Senate committee on the Fox vehicle operations. He testified that the Fox vehicles initially alerted for mustard and phosgene oxime; in fact, the initial alerts were for mustard and phosgene. The British government responded to the press articles, stating that Chemical and Biological Defence Establishment analyzed the liquid samples and the results were consistent with the presence of nitric acid; there was no evidence of chemical warfare agents. However, on Nov. 12, 1995, The Mail on Sunday published an interview with a former British sergeant assigned to the 21st EOD Squadron during the Gulf War.[131] The sergeant served as the Bomb Disposal Engineer during operations to extract samples from the tank. He stated the tests at the Kuwaiti Girls' School indicated the presence of mustard agent. He questioned the letter to Parliament from the Chemical and Biological Defence Establishment (CBDE) Porton Down, dated Jan. 25, 1995. He believed the letter asserted that CBDE Porton Down conducted laboratory tests on the injured British lance corporal's individual protective equipment. In fact, the letter simply referred to ""damage to the NBC suit material"" and stated that samples collected in Kuwait City were provided to CBDE Porton Down for analysis.[132] Anecdotal reports referenced damaged protective garments, but these reports referred to the field tests on the suit material conducted by the commanding officer of the 3rd Troop of the 21st EOD Squadron. The samples referred to in the CBDE Porton Down letter were the liquid samples deposited on XAD-4 resin.

The British press articles generated further concern by British members of Parliament regarding the presence of chemical warfare agent at the Kuwaiti Girls' School. The unresolved questions and confusion concerning the four separate testing operations prompted the DOD and the UK Ministry of Defence to conduct a joint review of the events related to the discovery, testing, and disposal of the tank. Investigators from the DOD Office of the Special Assistant for Gulf War Illnesses, the British Gulf Veterans' Illnesses Unit, and analysts from the U.S. intelligence community worked together to address the issues of concern. Obtaining contemporary information about the testing and analysis of the liquid in the tank was a priority. In addition, it was important to determine whether the equipment used in the testing and sampling operations would register a false positive in the presence of a strong oxidizer such as inhibited red fuming nitric acid. Investigators interviewed thirty-one people who were involved directly with the discovery, testing, and disposal of the tank in 1991, at least 13 members of various UK government agencies and 15 members of various U.S. government agencies, the United Nations, representatives of the government of Kuwait and three non-governmental organizations.

1. 1997 Laboratory Analysis of Inhibited Red Fuming Nitric Acid

During the initial stages of this investigation in early 1997, we did not have the original Fox vehicle MM-1 tapes produced at the Kuwaiti Girls' School. Information printed on the Fox MM-1 tapes, specifically spectra data, would have been invaluable in attempts to identify the substance in the tank at the Kuwaiti Girls' School. However, since this information was unavailable, the U.S. Army Soldier and Biological Chemical Command, previously called the Chemical and Biological Defense Command, conducted laboratory tests to determine if inhibited red fuming nitric acid (IRFNA) could cause the MM-1 mobile mass spectrometer to false alarm. Unable to obtain a sample of the inhibited red fuming nitric acid used in Iraq's Seersucker/Silkworm missiles, scientists used laboratory-grade red fuming nitric acid in its place.[133] Red fuming nitric acid lacks an inhibitor (e.g., hydrogen fluoride or hydrogen iodine), which impedes corrosion of the container. During the laboratory tests, a MM-1 initially alerted for the nerve agent cyclosarin when exposed to laboratory-grade red fuming nitric acid.[134]

The Presidential Advisory Committee on Gulf War Veterans' Illnesses expressed concern regarding the disparity between these 1997 laboratory results and the results from 1991 tests at the Kuwaiti Girls' School.[135] At the Kuwaiti Girls' School in 1991, two Fox vehicle MM-1s alarmed for the possible presence of chemical warfare agents, mustard and phosgene, when they tested liquid samples from the tank. Nevertheless, the DOD concluded in 1997 the tank at the Kuwaiti Girls' School contained red fuming nitric acid. The project manager, NBC Defense Systems at the U.S. Army Chemical and Biological Defense Command, attributed the conflicting test results to the use of laboratory-grade red fuming nitric acid instead of the inhibited red fuming nitric acid believed to be in the tank. In addition, the possibility of a chemical warfare agent coexisting in the tank with red fuming nitric acid was viewed as extremely unlikely because red fuming nitric acid was used as a preferred decontaminating substance in mustard laboratory and production facilities before the Gulf War.[136] U.S. Central Intelligence Agency and DOD analysts also expressed concern the tank's contents were not pure due to contamination from the corrosive effects of inhibited red fuming nitric acid on the sampling tube or plunger used to take samples. Other environmental factors, such as the temperature and humidity, may have produced condensation in the tank, which would have altered the composition of the liquid contents in the tank. It is also possible that unknown contaminants entered the tank via the bullet holes. The tank's exposure to the environmental conditions and possible contaminants could not be duplicated in the 1997 laboratory tests, and may account for the variance between the MM-1's alerts for different substances than those represented on the Fox tapes from the 1991 operation at the Kuwaiti Girls' School. In addition, the tank's exposure to the environment could account for the increased pH level of the tank's contents. The pH level of nitric acid is approximately 1.0. However the Chemical and Biological Defence Establishment's test results in 1991 showed pH levels of 2.0 and 2.2. It is known that nitric acid will absorb water vapor rapidly[137] and it is possible that changes in humidity and temperature in the tank over an unknown period could have altered the pH level of the tank's contents.

2. 1997 Analysis of the Fox MM-1 Tapes

During discussions with the UK Ministry of Defence in July 1997, we discussed our difficulty in locating the original Fox MM-1 tapes from the Kuwaiti Girls' School. We learned that the Ministry of Defence kept a copy of the MM-1 tapes (at the Chemical Biological Defence Establishment). The UK Ministry of Defence provided copies of the MM-1 tapes to our office and we resubmitted them to the U.S. Army Chemical and Biological Defense Command for analysis.

The MM-1 operator can print certain information about the chemicals displayed on the MM-1 screen (e.g., a list of ion masses and intensities) on a paper tape for record keeping and further analysis. Because every chemical has a characteristic combination of ions, known as a spectrum,[138] the MM-1 is able to identify chemicals by examining the spectrum. However, because the MM-1 makes initial detections using only a portion of a chemical's entire spectrum and looks for only a limited number of possible chemical warfare agents, it can sound false alarms for chemical warfare agents in the presence of similar ion patterns from other types of contaminating substances. Therefore, a second step in the analysis process is required to more definitively identify the sample where the entire library of known chemical warfare agents stored in the MM-1's memory is compared to the sample's spectrum.[139]

If a properly performed MM-1 spectrum analysis identifies a chemical warfare agent, the MM-1 operator and the Fox commander can be confident, although not assured, that the chemical warfare agent is present. Further analysis of the spectrum tape printout by a mass spectrometry expert, comparing the spectrum results to an established database of compounds, can increase the confidence level of the detection. Conversely, if the spectrum analysis does not identify one of the chemical warfare agents contained in the MM-1 library, the MM-1 operator and the Fox commander can be confident that any chemical warfare agent displayed during the initial alarm is not present. When the MM-1 cannot match any of the compounds stored in its library to the substance being analyzed, it indicates ""unknown"" on the operator's screen and the MM-1 tape printout.[140]

The MM-1 tapes from Fox vehicle C-23 (Figure 18) show that at 12:50 PM (August 9, 1991), the MM-1 alerted to the possible presence of the choking agent phosgene (CG). Following the initial alert for phosgene, the C-23 MM-1 operator initiated a spectrum analysis. The result, printed on the MM-1 tape at 12:51 PM, was ""unknown""-this substance not only was not phosgene, it was not any substance in the MM-1 library. A second initial alert for phosgene (Figure 18) occurred at 13:22 (1:22 PM), followed by spectrum results of ""unknown"" at 13:23 (1:23 PM) and 13:25 (1:25 PM). The complete MM-1 tape (Tab H) also shows detailed spectrum results printed at 13:27 (1:27 PM), 13:29 (1:29 PM), and 13:30 (1:30 PM).

The MM-1 tapes from Fox vehicle C-26 (Figure 19) show spectrum results at 12:51 PM also indicating an unknown substance. The MM-1 operator printed the results to the MM-1 tape and used that information to program the unknown substance into the MM-1's memory; he named the substance ""Extra Subst A1."" From 12:53 p.m. to 1 p.m., C-26's MM-1 initially alerted to the possible presence of phosgene three times and to the extra substance A1 15 times. At 1:00 p.m. another spectrum analysis indicated ""unknown."" The MM-1 operator printed the results to the MM-1 tape and used those results to program this unknown substance into the MM-1's memory; he named this substance ""Extra Subst A2."" The complete C-26 MM-1 tapes (Tab H) show at 1:02 p.m. the MM-1 alerted to the possible presence of A1, A2, phosgene (CG), and S Mustard (HD)-a blister agent; from 1:03 p.m. to 1:39 p.m., initial alerts continued for various combinations of all of the above substances; however four additional spectra indicated A2 twice and unknown twice.

A thorough understanding of the MM-1 and mass spectrometry is necessary to comprehend the MM-1 tapes, so experts at the U.S. Army's Chemical and Biological Defense Command (now known as the Soldier and Biological Chemical Command), the U.S. Department of Commerce National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), and Bruker Daltonics, the MM-1 manufacturer, analyzed the MM-1 tapes from both Fox vehicles at our request.

Bruker Daltonics provided the following assessment of the MM-1 tapes:

The tape shows that the system passed its automatic test on start-up indicating there were no major system failures. Approximately thirty minutes later, the system indicates an initial alarm that phosgene may be present.... Immediately, as called for to confirm the alarm in SOP [standard operating procedure], a spectrum is taken ... and the search of the 60 compound library indicates that the compound is unknown (not in the library of agents). Furthermore … the complete spectra in these tapes do not confirm the presence of CWA [chemical warfare agent]….[141]

In their analysis of the MM-1 tapes, NIST experts stated, ""After examining the tapes from two Fox vehicles ... it is clear that there is no mass spectral evidence confirming the presence of either of the two CW agents reported (phosgene and HD).""[142]

The U.S. Army Chemical and Biological Defense Command's NBC defense systems project manager stated,

None of the initial warnings for either phosgene or mustard agent were verified by the MM-1 mass spectrometers located in either of the two Fox NBC reconnaissance vehicles that were at the site. Personnel followed … [a] scenario that included a second sample analysis and comparison to an internal library. In every retest, the MM-1 reported the spectrum analysis as ""unknown."" In the cases where the crew renamed this ""unknown"" as an 'extra substance' in the library, the MM-1 identified the spectra as that ""extra substance.""[143]

After examining the MM-1 tape spectra, all three of the expert agencies offered explanations regarding the initial alerts for the possible presence of the chemical warfare agents.

Bruker Daltonics noted:

[The MM-1] assign[ed] the unknown compound a concentration ... approximately 200 times as intense as the ions used to initially alarm for phosgene.... The most intense ion in the spectrum is mass 46 (100%).... For vehicle C-26, it appears from the spectrum at 12:51, that this system may have both hydrocarbon background and calibration compound. In this spectrum [mass] 69 is actually larger than the mass 46 (100% versus 62.3%).... At 13:01, mass 46 is now 100% ... the complete spectra in these tapes do not confirm the presence of CWA in the tank in question, but rather [are] consistent with the independent analysis that the brown oily liquid was in fact fuming nitric acid.[144]

In his analysis, the NBC defense systems project manager, wrote:

Ion mass 46 at 100% intensity was reported on every MM-1 tape, except one, and is identical to trials conducted at CBDCOM [Chemical/Biological Defense Command] using research grade red fuming nitric acid (RFNA).… The tapes from one of the Fox NBC reconnaissance vehicles indicate a mass 69 ion with 100% intensity. While this is a deviation from all other analyses that had mass 46 at 100%, it is easily explained. Coupled with the presence of other specific ions in significant amounts, this duplicates other known incidents of the fluorocarbon calibration gas escaping into the analysis system. Each of the three tapes from the MM-1 on this vehicle contains the presence of these peaks, indicating sample contamination with calibration gas. Subtraction of the calibration gas results in spectra which are similar to those of the other vehicle where ion mass 46 is the major component in the sample.[145]

Lastly, NIST experts stated, ""the general finding that the largest peak is m/z 46, the principal peak in nitrogen dioxide, is consistent with the introduction of red fuming nitric acid into the mass spectrometers of both vehicles.""[146]

The MM-1's inability to identify the presence of nitric acid (in any form) in the tank is because nitric acid or red fuming nitric acid, with or without an inhibitor, is not considered a chemical warfare agent. The MM-1s aboard Fox vehicles C-23 and C-26 did not identify nitric acid in the liquid samples because its library only contains the formulation of chemical warfare agents and nitric acid was not one of the chemical compounds stored in the libraries of either MM-1. Thus, following spectrum analyses, both vehicles' MM-1s indicated the spectrum results as unknown.

In summary, experts at the U.S. Army's Chemical and Biological Defense Command, the National Institute of Standards and Technology, and Bruker Daltonics carefully analyzed the MM-1 tapes from both Fox vehicles at the Kuwaiti Girls' School on Aug. 9, 1991. Their analyses are similar-all told us that despite initial alarms from Fox vehicles C-23 and C-26 for the possible presence of phosgene and HD mustard, the MM-1 spectra show that these chemical warfare agents were not present in samples from the tank at the Kuwaiti Girls' School. They all indicated that nitric acid, in some form, was partly responsible for the false alarms.

Attempts to identify the contents of the tank found at the Kuwaiti Girls' School proved difficult because of conflicting or contradictory indicators. Maj. Watkinson conducted numerous field tests on the vapors emitting from the tank and the liquid contents. Some were positive for mustard chemical warfare agent-the Chemical Agent Monitor produced an eight bar positive result for the presence of mustard and some of the M18A2 kit tests produced the signatory blue color change indicating mustard presence. However, the test with the one-color paper failed to identify a blister agent presence. The three-color paper tests and the remaining M18A2 tests were less definitive but implied a blister agent was there. The results were sufficient for Maj. Watkinson to suspect a possible presence of mustard agent. Further inspection of the tank and its contents by the Fox vehicles reinforced this perception among many participants who tested the tank because one vehicle's MM-1 mass spectrometers alerted to mustard agent and phosgene and the other alerted to phosgene. Although subsequent spectrum analyses by these same vehicles revealed the substance was not a chemical warfare agent but an unknown substance, the Foxes' initial alerts were best remembered.

In 1994, the Senate Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs investigated the events at the Kuwaiti Girls' School and highlighted the positive detections of chemical warfare agents by multiple chemical warfare agent detectors. Consequently, the Senate committee concluded that the tank contained chemical warfare agent. In 1997, the Presidential Advisory Committee on Gulf War Veterans' Illnesses concurred with the Senate committee's findings based on the multiple positive detections reported by veterans and the lack of contemporary evidence to the contrary.

However, despite these pronouncements and the initial results of the detectors, much more convincing evidence refutes a conclusion of a chemical warfare agent presence. Maj. Watkinson's initial test with one-color paper denied its presence. He also noted that the high vapor pressure in the tank, the speed with which the small sample evaporated from the testing pan, the low viscosity of the liquid, and the liquid's ability to quickly penetrate his individual protective clothing were uncharacteristic of a mustard agent. Rust-colored vapor is also abnormal for mustard. Additionally, the Army Corps of Engineers safety officer, unprotected by chemical protective clothing or mask, approached close enough to the tank to smell the contents and report the smell of nitric acid. That he experienced neither blister agent nor choking agent reactions supports the probability that the tank contained something other than these agents.

There were other indicators that the tank did not contain chemical warfare agents. The high volatility of the liquid as the soldiers attempted to capture samples resulted in the violent reaction with the XAD-4 resin causing the glass capture tube to shatter. The XAD-4 resin was designed for the capture of chemical warfare agents and the reaction was atypical. The liquid heated and melted the gloves of sampling team members. However, chemical protective gloves are made of butyl rubber impermeable to chemical warfare agents. The tests conducted by the commanding officer of the 3rd Troop, 21st Explosive Ordnance Disposal squadron on the individual protective clothing showed that the liquid burned through the material within three minutes-again, an uncharacteristic property of a chemical warfare agent. Finally, the liquid caused an immediate blister on the wrist of a British lance corporal. Neither mustard nor phosgene would cause such an injury so fast. Although phosgene oxime might cause such a response, phosgene oxime presence was speculation based on the end result (blisters), but other substances like nitric acid could have the same result. No evidence of phosgene oxime came to light in this investigation.

Although one Fox vehicle gave initial alerts for phosgene and mustard chemical warfare agents, and the other alerted to phosgene only, their more definitive spectrum analyses proved that those agents were not present. Instead they showed that a substance unknown to the Fox was present. In 1997, experts at the U.S. Army's Chemical and Biological Defense Command, the National Institute of Standards and Technology, and Bruker Daltonics, the manufacturer of the MM-1 mobile mass spectrometer, reviewed the Fox mass spectrometry tapes including full spectrums produced at the Kuwaiti Girls' School. All three experts concluded that chemical warfare agent was not present in the tank, and stated that nitric acid, in some form, was partly responsible for the initial alarms. Laboratory tests by the U.S. Army's Soldier Biological and Chemical Command revealed that laboratory-grade red fuming nitric acid will cause the MM-1 to false alarm for the presence of chemical warfare agent. Although the tests were unable to duplicate the alerts for phosgene and mustard, the experts concluded the difference was due to their inability to exactly replicate the liquid in the tank. In any case, the complete spectra on the tapes indicate the Fox vehicles detected a nitric acid compound, not a chemical warfare agent.

Finally, the evidence that weighs most heavily in our assessment is the contemporaneous testing of samples of the contents of the tank at the Kuwaiti Girls' School. These samples, taken under standard procedures by trained personnel, transported under chain-of-custody control, and evaluated by the Chemical and Biological Defence Establishment, Porton Down, a laboratory designated by UNSCOM for expert chemical warfare agent analyses, showed no evidence of any chemical warfare agent. Instead, the 1991 report results showed that laboratory analysis of the samples was entirely consistent with the contents of the tank being nitric acid. Furthermore, since the chemical properties of nitric acid would not allow a chemical warfare agent to coexist in the tank, chemical warfare agent was not present.

In our 1998 report we initially believed that IRFNA was definitely present in the tank. However, because the laboratory did not conduct additional tests to determine other possible substances or contaminants in the tank, we cannot be certain of the nature of the nitric acid. Witnesses reported rust-colored vapors emitting from the bullet holes in the tank, which implies the substance may have been a red fuming nitric acid. We also believe an inhibitor was in the tank because witnesses did not report any evidence of corrosion of the tank.

The physical evidence, the Fox mobile mass spectrometry tapes, and the laboratory analysis of the liquid samples provide more compelling and more corroborating arguments than do the initial detector alerts. Furthermore, we conclude that the tank definitely contained a form of nitric acid, most likely inhibited red fuming nitric acid. Consequently, we assess the liquid in the tank at the Kuwaiti Girls' School was definitely not a chemical warfare agent.

AC

A blood agent. Chemical Name: Hydrogen cyanide[147]

Blister agent

A blister agent is a chemical warfare agent that produces local irritation and damage to the skin and mucous membranes, pain and injury to the eyes, reddening and blistering of the skin, and when inhaled, damage to the respiratory tract. Blister agents include mustards (HD, HN, HQ, HT, and Q), arsenicals like lewisite (L), and mustard and lewisite mixtures (HL). Blister agents are also called vesicants or vesicant agents.[148 , 149]

Blood agent

A blood agent is a chemical warfare agent that is inhaled and absorbed into the blood, carrying the agent to all body tissues where it interferes with the tissue oxygenation process. The brain is especially affected. The effect on the brain leads to cessation of respiration followed by cardiovascular collapse. Examples of blood agents are AC and CK.[150]

Chemical Agent Monitor (CAM)

A CAM is a hand-held, soldier-operated device that is used to monitor chemical warfare agent contamination on soldiers and equipment. The CAM may give false readings when used in enclosed spaces or when sampling near strong vapor sources (e.g., in dense smoke). Some vapors known to give false readings are aromatic vapors (perfumes, food flavorings, some aftershaves, peppermints, cough lozenges, and menthol cigarettes when vapors are exhaled directly into the nozzle), cleaning compounds (disinfectants, methyl salicylate, menthol), smokes and fumes (exhaust from some rocket motors, fumes from some munitions), and some wood preservative treatments (polychlorinated biphenyls or PCBs).[151]

Chemical and Biological Defense Command (CBDCOM)

CBDCOM was a US Army command with a mission to provide research, development, and acquisition for nuclear, biological, chemical (NBC), and obscurant equipment for the US Forces: to act as the Army NBC defense commodity command; to provide management of joint service NBC defense material; to provide US chemical stockpile management and safe storage; to provide installation management; to prepare for and respond to chemical biological emergency events/accidents; provide weapons of mass destruction (chemical or biological) domestic preparedness support; to conduct emergency remediation/restoration actions at chemical sites; to provide successful planning, management, and execution of treaty responsibilities; and to provide demilitarization support. The Chemical and Biological Defense Command merged with the Soldier Support Command to form the Soldier and Biological Chemical Command.[152]

Chemical warfare agent (CWA)

A chemical warfare agent is a chemical substance used in military operations to kill, seriously injure, or incapacitate through its physiological effects. Excluded are riot control agents, herbicides, smoke, and flame. Included are blood, nerve, blister, choking, and incapacitating agents.[153]

Chromatography

A process in which a chemical mixture carried by a liquid or gas is separated into its individual components.[154]

CK

A blood agent. Chemical Name: Cyanogen chloride[155]

Contaminant

A substance that, when present in the absence of a chemical warfare agent or the presence of chemical agent at the blank level causes a false positive when otherwise a true negative would have resulted[156]

CX

Phosgene oxime (see urticant and blister agent) Chemical Name: Dichloroformoxime[157]

Cyclosarin

A nerve agent known as GF. Chemical Name: O-Cyclohexyl-methylfluorophosphonate[158]

Detection Paper

Detection paper works because certain dyes are soluble in chemical warfare agents. Normally, two dyes and one pH indicator are mixed with cellulose fibers in a paper without special coloring (unbleached). When the paper absorbs a drop of chemical warfare agent, it dissolves one of the pigments. Mustard agent dissolves a red dye and nerve agent a yellow dye. In addition, VX nerve agent causes the indicator to turn to blue—which, together with the yellow, will become green or green-black. Detection paper can thus be used to distinguish between three different types of chemical warfare agents. A disadvantage with the papers is that many other substances can also dissolve the pigments. Consequently, detection papers should not be located in places where drops of solvent, fat, oil, or fuel can fall on them. Drops of water cause no reaction.[159]

Distilled Mustard

A blister agent known as HD. Chemical name: Bis-(2-chloroethyl) sulfide[160]

Dyspnea

Difficult or labored respiration.[161]

Enzyme

Any of the numerous complex proteins that are produced by living cells and catalyze specific biochemical reactions at body temperatures.[162]

Erythema

Abnormal redness of the skin due to capillary congestion.[163]

Explosive ordnance disposal (EOD)

The detection, identification, on-site evaluation, rendering safe, recovery, and final disposal of unexploded explosive ordnance. It may also include removal of explosive ordnance that has become hazardous by damage or deterioration.[164]

Flamazine

Also known as silver sulfadiazine. A sulfa medicine used to prevent bacterial or fungus infections. It works by killing the fungus or bacteria. It is applied to the skin.[165]

Fox Nuclear, Biological, Chemical (NBC) Reconnaissance System

The Fox is a six-wheeled, light armored vehicle designed primarily for reconnaissance of liquid chemical warfare agent hazards. On-board chemical warfare agent detection capabilities include the MM-1 mobile mass spectrometer, which is the primary detection device, the M43A1 chemical agent detector, which is an integral component of the M8 alarm system, and the M256A1 chemical agent detector kit. The Fox is also equipped with two radiation detectors. The Fox does not provide any biological warfare agent detection capability, but it does protect the crew from biological hazards, and it allows the crew to mark areas of potential hazard and safely take samples for laboratories to analyze for biological hazards.[166]

Fuller's Earth

An earthy substance that consists chiefly of clay mineral but lacks plasticity and that is used as an adsorbent, as filter medium and a carrier for catalysts.[167]

GA

A G-series nerve agent known as tabun. Chemical name: Ethyl N,N-dimethylphosphoroamidocyanidate[168]

GB

A G-series nerve agent known as sarin. Chemical name: Isopropyl methyl phosphonofluoridate[169]

GD

A G-series nerve agent known as Soman. Chemical name: Pinacolyl methyl phosphonofluoridate[170]

GF

A G-series nerve agent known as cyclosarin. Chemical Name: O-Cyclohexyl-methylfluorophosphonate[171]

G-series nerve agent

G-series nerve agents are lethal chemical warfare agents that work by inhibiting the proper functioning of the cholinesterase enzymes needed for the transmission of nerve impulses throughout the body. These agents affect the functioning of all bodily systems, including the eyes, nose, throat, lungs, and muscles. The G-series nerve agents include tabun (GA), sarin (GB), soman (GD), and cyclosarin (GF). The normal sequence of symptoms is a running nose, tightness of the chest, dimness of vision and pinpointing of the eye pupils, difficulty breathing, drooling and excessive sweating, nausea, vomiting, cramps, involuntary defecation and urination, twitching, jerking and staggering, headache, confusion, drowsiness, and coma. Cessation of breathing and death follow.[172]

GulfLink

A World Wide Web site maintained by the Office of the Special Assistant to the Under Secretary of Defense (Personnel and Readiness) for Gulf War Illnesses, Medical Readiness, and Military Deployments (www.gulflink.health.mil).

HD

L

A blister agent known as lewisite. Chemical Name: Dichloro-(2-chlorovinyl)arsine[182]

Lute

To seal or cover (as a joint or surface) with lute. [183]

M18/M18A2 Chemical Agent Detector Kit

The M18 and improved M18A2 kits are portable, expendable items capable of surface and vapor analyses. The M18A2 kit is designed primarily for detecting dangerous concentrations of vapors, aerosols, and liquid droplets of chemical agents. Distinctive color changes indicate the presence of a chemical warfare agent.[184]

M19 Sampling and Analyzing Kit

The M19 kit is a portable, expendable item used to identify chemical agents, perform the preliminary processing of unidentifiable chemical or biological warfare agent samples, and delineate contaminated areas.[185]

M256 chemical warfare agent detector kit

In the field, the M256-series chemical warfare agent detector kit is simply referred to as the M256 kit. The M256 kit is a portable, expendable item capable of detecting and identifying hazardous concentrations of blister, blood, and nerve agents. The M256 kit is used after a chemical warfare agent warning to test for and confirm the presence and type of chemical warfare agent, and to determine if it is safe to unmask. The M256A1 kit has replaced the M256 kit. The only difference between the two kits is that the M256A1 kit will detect lower levels of nerve agent. US forces used both the M256 kit and the M256A1 kit during the Gulf War.

Some smokes, high temperatures, standard US decontamination solution number two (DS2), and petroleum products may cause false readings. Results may be inaccurate when sampling is performed in smoke from burning debris.[186]

M81A chemical alarm

The M8A1 is an automatic chemical agent detection and warning system designed to detect the presence of nerve agent vapors or inhalable aerosols. The M8A1 will automatically signal the presence of the nerve agent in the air with both an audible and visual warning. The US military fielded the M8A1 to replace the wet chemical M8 detector—which eliminated the M229 refill kit, the logistic burden, and associated costs. The M8A1 operates in a fixed, portable, or vehicle mounted configuration.[187]

Mission Oriented Protective Posture (MOPP)

Mission oriented protective posture (MOPP) is a flexible system used to direct the wearing of chemical protective garments and mask—a system that balances mission requirements with the chemical warfare agent threat. Wearing chemical protective garments and mask provides soldiers protection against most known chemical warfare agents, biological agents, and toxins.

At MOPP Level 0 soldiers carry their protective mask while their remaining MOPP gear must be readily available (e.g., within the work area, fighting position, living space, etc.) At MOPP Level 1, soldiers wear their overgarment and carry the rest of their MOPP gear. At MOPP Level 2, soldiers wear their overgarment and overboots while carrying the mask with hood and gloves. At MOPP Level 3, soldiers wear their overgarment, overboots, and mask with hood, but not the gloves. At MOPP Level 4, soldiers wear all their MOPP gear.[188]Commanders can raise or lower the amount of protection through five levels of MOPP. In addition, commanders, under certain situations, can exercise a mask-only option.[189]

MM-1 mobile mass spectrometer

The MM-1 mobile mass spectrometer is the primary chemical warfare agent detector in the Fox reconnaissance vehicle. During Operation Desert Storm, the MM-1 monitored against a target list of approximately ten selected chemical warfare agents most likely to be present, based on intelligence reports of the suspected chemical warfare agent threat. To speed the initial search, the sampling probe operates at 180ï¿½ C and the MM-1 looks for only four ion peaks of each detected chemical warfare agent and attempts to match the target list of chemicals against the pattern and ratio of these peaks. If an initial match is made with these four ion peaks at a pre-determined intensity and relationship, the MM-1 sounds an alarm. However, this first alarm does not confirm the presence of a chemical warfare agent, since there are many chemicals that have similar ion peaks and many combinations of chemicals that may yield ion patterns similar to those in the target list. Consequently, the MM-1 can falsely indicate the presence of dangerous chemical warfare agents. To more conclusively determine what chemical is present, the operator must lower the sampling probe temperature to 120ï¿½ C, re-acquire a sample of the suspected substance, and run a spectrum analysis with the MM-1 against all the detection algorithms stored in the MM-1 chemical library. For more detailed analysis later, the complete ion spectrum of the suspected sample can be printed on a paper tape.[190]

Mustard

A group of agents that includes the sulfur mustards (H and HD) which are chlorinated thioethers, and the nitrogen mustards (HN-1, HN-2 and HN-3) which are considered derivatives of ammonia. Mustards can penetrate skin and a great number of materials. These materials include wood, leather, rubber and paints. Because of their physical properties, mustards are very persistent under cold temperature conditions. [191]

m/z

m/z represents mass-to-charge ratio. A mass spectrum (e.g., what is seen on the MM-1 screen) represents the detection of ion fragments with a specific m/z. Each vertical line on the X-axis represents a fragment of a particular mass to charge ratio. The intensity of the lines (measured along the Y-axis) represents the count (the number of fragments detected with that ratio).[192]

Nerve agents

Nerve agents are highly toxic and among the deadliest of chemical warfare agents. Nerve agents may be absorbed through any body surface; the skin, eyes, and respiratory tract, and through the gastrointestinal tract when ingested with food or water. They affect the nervous and the respiratory systems and various body functions. Nerve agents include the G-series and V-series chemical warfare agents such as G-agents Tabun (GA), Sarin (GB), Soman (GD), and GF. A V-agent is VX. Detailed descriptions of nerve agents are found in US Army Field Manual 3-9.[193]

pH

A chemistry measurement of acidity and alkalinity, the pH scale ranges from 0 to14, with 7 as the neutral point. A substance with a pH lower than 7 is acidic, while a pH above 7 is alkaline.[194]

Pulmonary Edema

Abnormal accumulation of fluid in the lungs.[195]

Q

A blister agent, known as sesqui-mustard, Q is a more effective chemical warfare vesicant than sulfur mustard (H). It produces symptoms consistent with blister type agents, with about five times stronger skin activity than distilled mustard (HD). The fact that it is in solid form at room temperature with a very low vapor pressure hinders its effective use as a chemical warfare agent. Combining sesqui-mustard (Q) with distilled mustard (HD) to form sulfur-mustard/sesqui-mustard (HQ) helped to eliminate this problem. Chemical name: Ethylene bis (2-Chloroethyl) sulfide, or 1,2-Bis (2-chloroethylthio) ethane[196]

Riot control agent

A riot control agent is a chemical that produces transient effects that disappear within minutes after exposure and rarely require medical treatment. Riot control agents are effective in quelling civil disturbances and in some military operations, in preventing unnecessary loss of life.[197]

Sarin

A nerve agent known as GB. Chemical name: Isoproyl methylphosphonofluoridate[198]

Soldier and Biological Chemical Command (SBCCOM)

Headquartered at Aberdeen Proving Ground, Maryland, SBCCOM has a broad research, development and acquisition mission to ensure the decisive edge and maximum protection for the United States. SBCCOM develops, acquires, and sustains soldier, soldier support, and nuclear, biological, and chemical defense technology, systems, and services. SBCCOM also provides for safe storage, treaty compliance, and destruction of chemical materiel.[199]

Soman

A nerve agent known as GD. Chemical name: Pinacolyl methyl phosphonofluoridate[200]

Tabun

A nerve agent known as GA. Chemical name: Ethyl N, N-dimethylphosphoroamidocyanidate[201]

Task force

A temporary grouping of units, under one commander, formed to carry out a specific operation or mission; a semi-permanent organization of units, under one commander, formed to carry out a continuing specific task; or a component of a fleet organized by the commander of a task fleet or higher authority to accomplish a specific task or tasks.[202]

Universal Transverse Mercator Grid (UTM)

UTM is a coordinate system used for creating maps. The UTM system projects a series of intersecting grid lines on the Earth's surface, extending from 84 degrees north to 80 degrees south latitudes. Also called UTM Grid.[203]

Urticant

A substance that causes a burning or itching of the skin such as that caused by nettle stings.[204]

V-series agents

V-series agents are persistent, highly toxic nerve agents developed in the mid-1950s and absorbed primarily through the skin. V-series agents are generally odorless liquids which do not evaporate rapidly. The standard V agent is VX.[205]

Vesicant

Agent that acts on the eyes and lungs, capable of producing blisters, and blisters the skin[206]

VX

V-series nerve agent. Chemical Name: O-ethyl-S-(2-diisopropylaminoethyl)methyl phosphonothiolate[207]

In an update shared by Military Health System Communications, Stephen Ferrara, who was appointed in January and is currently fulfilling the responsibilities of the assistant secretary of defense for health affairs, emphasized readiness as a “strategic imperative to ensure warfighter dominance, survivability, and resilience.”

“Readiness cannot be secondary,” Ferrara said. “You cannot do readiness at the last minute. You cannot cram for readiness. When it comes to mission success, readiness is everything.”

Ferrara, who was deployed four times as an active-duty surgeon in the U.S. Navy, noted that the Military Health System is the only health care system in the country that “goes to war.”

“When America’s sons and daughters go downrange and go into harm’s way, we honor the pact we made with them and with their parents, that should they become ill or injured, they will receive prompt and effective medical attention anywhere in the world,” Ferrara said. “That is the trust that we have. That’s something that our adversaries don’t always have, and it gives us an incredible strategic edge.”

Ferrara explained that his top priorities for the Military Health System include providing high-quality, accessible, and sustainable care, increasing the lethality of America’s warfighters, and sustaining the medical force’s skills. Ferrara said, “We have to support the warfighter, sustain our skills and strengthen our chain.”

“If we support, sustain and strengthen, that is how we build a system that will fight and win because fundamentally, this is what our job is: to fight and win,” Ferrara added. “We do this by having a ready medical force so we can provide strong battlefield care and keep guns in the fight.”

According to the Defense Department, Ferrara said part of his job is demonstrating to Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth how the Military Health System aligns with the Trump administration’s emphasis on “force lethality.” Ferrara explained that the Military Health System “optimizes warfighter performance” by ensuring the readiness of military service members and the individuals responsible for providing service members with medical care and recovery.

“It starts with maintaining the ready medical force,” Ferrara stated. “We must ensure that every member of the team — from the surgeon who wields a scalpel, to the logistician who procured the scalpel; from the nurse who transfuses the blood, to the team who runs the blood bank — is at the top of their game. A team ready to go downrange to fight and win.”",https://americanmilitarynews.com/wp-content/uploads/travel-medicine-2018.jpg,N,1.0,2025-04-16 11:56:20.140115

Wishing everyone in Virginia’s Sixth District a blessed and meaningful week ahead.","House Republicans last week continued delivering on the America First agenda. I introduced a bill to stop federal employees from using taxpayer-funded time for union activities, supported legislation to ensure only American citizens vote in our elections, and backed efforts to remove businesses tied to foreign adversaries from operating on U.S. military bases. I also enjoyed meeting with students and local leaders up in Washington D.C. and across the Sixth District who are working to make our community stronger. I’ll keep fighting for our shared conservative values in Washington.

Standing Up for Taxpayers

Federal employees are hired to serve the American people, not to engage in union activities on the taxpayers’ dime. “Official time” was established under the 1978 Civil Service Reform Act to allow federal employees to represent labor unions while remaining on the federal payroll. However, it has grown into an unaccountable and costly practice that diverts resources away from the core functions of government.

In 2016 alone, federal employees spent 3.6 million hours on union-related activities, costing taxpayers a staggering $177.2 million. Taxpayers shouldn’t be footing the bill for federal employees to conduct union business instead of fulfilling their official duties.

That’s why I was proud to join Senator Mike Lee (R-UT) in introducing the No Union Time on the Taxpayer’s Dime Act. This bill would end the use of official time and ensure your taxpayer dollars are used responsibly, increasing accountability across the federal workforce. Public funds should serve the American people, not private interests. I’ll keep fighting to hold Washington accountable and make sure your hard-earned money is spent wisely.

Advancing President Trump’s America First Agenda

Last week, the House passed a budget resolution that moves us one step closer to delivering on President Trump’s America First agenda and the promises we made to the American people. With this resolution now in place, House Republicans are ready to get to work alongside our Senate counterparts to craft a reconciliation bill that reflects the conservative priorities we were sent here to deliver. This process will require close coordination with the White House to ensure the final product secures our border, strengthens our national defense, unleashes American energy, and preserves the Trump tax cuts that have helped so many hardworking families across Virginia.

I’ll continue working with my colleagues to advance a budget that cuts wasteful spending, protects taxpayer dollars, and puts America first. I joined Fox Business’ Mornings with Maria to discuss the importance of this budget resolution and our work to advance the America First agenda.

Ensuring Only Americans Vote in American Elections

The right to vote is a foundational principle of our republic, and its integrity must be protected. Currently, federal law states that it is illegal for foreign nationals or noncitizens to vote in U.S. federal elections or donate with regards to federal, state, or local elections in order to protect the integrity of our elections. However, noncitizens continue to unlawfully register to vote, diluting the votes of American citizens and potentially allowing foreign interference in our elections. Over 8.8 million illegal immigrants have crossed the border under President Biden, including 394 on the terrorist watchlist. In Virginia, more than 1,500 noncitizens were found on our voter rolls. We must protect the integrity of our elections and ensure only American citizens are casting a ballot.

That’s why I proudly supported the Safeguard American Voter Eligibility (SAVE) Act, which passed the House last week. This commonsense legislation requires proof of citizenship when registering to vote and requires states to remove non-citizens from their voter rolls. Our elections should be decided by the American people, and only the American people. This bill strengthens election integrity, defends against foreign interference, and restores trust in our democratic process.

Legislative Update: Protecting Our Military Bases from Foreign Adversaries

The Chinese Communist Party has no business operating on U.S. military bases, but right now, they are. GNC, the well-known vitamin and supplement retailer, was purchased in 2020 by Harbin Pharmaceuticals, a company directly tied to the Chinese Communist Party. Shockingly, GNC operates over 80 storefronts on American military installations, including here in Virginia. These stores have direct access to our servicemembers, their families, and sensitive base environments, creating serious risks for data collection, surveillance, and foreign influence.

That’s why I’m proud to co-sponsor the Military Installation Retail Security Act, led by Rep. Pat Harrigan. This important legislation would prohibit companies owned or influenced by hostile foreign governments like China, Russia, Iran, or North Korea from operating physical storefronts on U.S. military bases. It would also require a full review of all retail stores on base to identify any foreign ties.

This is a commonsense step to protect those who protect us. Our military communities should never be vulnerable to the influence of foreign adversaries, and I’ll keep working to ensure their safety and security.

Casework Update: Delivering for our Military Families

One of the most rewarding parts of my job is helping folks across the Sixth District when they’re having trouble with a federal agency, especially our military families.

Recently, a family from Frederick County reached out to my Winchester office after running into problems with Tricare processing a home birth claim from last April. After weeks of trying to fix the issue on their own, they turned to my office for help.

My staff worked directly with Tricare to get the problem resolved. The hang-up came from a missing digit in a code on their paperwork, which prevented the claim from being processed. After working through the issue, Tricare was able to enhance the image of the claim and process it successfully, giving this family the peace of mind they had been waiting for.

Whether it’s dealing with Tricare, the VA, Social Security, or any other federal agency, my office is here to help you cut through the red tape and get answers. If you need assistance, don’t hesitate to reach out to one of my district offices. We’re ready to help.

Celebrating Palm Sunday and Holy Week

Over the weekend, we celebrated Palm Sunday — marking the beginning of Holy Week and a time to reflect on Christ’s sacrifice and love for us all. Wishing everyone in Virginia’s Sixth District a blessed and meaningful week ahead.

“They took branches of palm trees, and went forth to meet him, and cried, Hosanna: Blessed is the King of Israel that cometh in the name of the Lord.” — John 12:13

Wishing a Blessed Passover

This past Saturday marked the beginning of Passover, a sacred time of reflection and celebration for Jewish families across Virginia’s Sixth District and around the world. As families gather this week to observe this important holiday, I want to wish all those celebrating a blessed and joyful Passover. Chag Sameach!

According to reports in the US media, the Defense Health Agency (DHA) decided that the acquisition of the biometric ring trackers was ""no longer required"", but declined to provide further details.

The deal was announced in October last year, with the US armed forces saying at the time that it planned to use the devices to better track the health and wellbeing of military personnel.

A spokesperson for Oura confirmed to Breaking Defense, a digital news outlet, that the contract had been cancelled.

""This contract was meant to be an efficiency initiative, and we believe that the DHA had a clear business case for how this would have reduced costs and operational inefficiencies from burnout,"" the spokesperson said.

Yle contacted Oura for comment, but the company said it had nothing further to say on the matter.

The breakdown of the deal was first reported in Finland by tech magazine Tekniikan Maailma, although reports abut the matter began appearing in US outlets more than a month ago.

US competitors resented Oura deal

According to Breaking Defense, the deal ran into difficulties when Oura's competitor, US-based wearable tech firm Whoop, filed a complaint with the Government Accountability Office — citing insufficient information in the original tender.

Dismal Q4 Results Prompts Multiple Downgrades

On April 15, 2025, RBC Capital Markets reportedly further reduced its price target for Zynex stock to $5 per share. This marks the second downward revision in as many months and represents a significant erosion from RBC's initial $11 per share target, effectively cutting its valuation outlook by approximately 55%.

The latest adjustment from RBC Capital analyst Shagun Singh follows a disappointing fourth-quarter 2024 earnings report on March 11 that revealed a year-over-year revenue decline of approximately 2%, landing at $46.0 million. The company also swung to a net loss of $0.02 per share, a stark contrast to the $0.04 profit reported in the same period a year prior, despite a stable gross profit margin of 78%.

Singh, who also downgraded Zynex's rating to ""Sector Perform"" from ""Outperform"" last month, cited a lack of clarity surrounding the company's operational and commercial prospects following the recent financial disclosure.

A significant factor weighing on Zynex is the temporary suspension of payments from Tricare, its largest customer, as the insurer conducts a review of past claims. The company has also declined to provide financial guidance for the current year and has initiated a workforce reduction of roughly 15%. Singh previously flagged the potential for a ""domino effect"" stemming from the Tricare situation, further eroding investor confidence.

The payment woes with Tricare appear to be intertwined with more serious allegations leveled against Zynex in a newly filed securities class action.

Zynex Securities Class Action Alleges ""Oversupplying"" Scheme

The securities class action lawsuit, Tuncel v. Zynex, Inc., et al., filed in the U.S. District Court for the District of Colorado, alleges that Zynex engaged in a practice of ""oversupplying"" customers with products, notably electrodes, which purportedly inflated revenue figures. The complaint contends that this practice drew the scrutiny of insurers, including Tricare, and that Zynex failed to adequately disclose the potential for adverse consequences such as network exclusions and potential government penalties. The class action seeks to represent investors who purchased Zynex securities between March 13, 2023, and March 11, 2025.

The truth allegedly began to emerge through a June 4, 2024 report by the medical journal STAAT, which detailed an alleged ""oversupplying scheme"" involving excessive shipments and inflated billing. The report also indicated that insurers were moving to exclude Zynex from their networks.

The lawsuit then points to Zynex's March 11, 2025, announcement of its weak fourth-quarter and full-year 2024 results as the moment the alleged truth was revealed. During the earnings call, Zynex CEO Thomas Sandgaard attributed the revenue shortfall to ""slower than normal payments from certain payers"" and the Tricare payment suspension.

Hagens Berman's Investigation

Hagens Berman is investigating the alleged claims. ""The recent developments, including the lowered outlook and the specifics of the class action, underscore the serious concerns surrounding Zynex's disclosures. Our investigation is focused on ensuring accountability for any potential wrongdoing that may have harmed investors,"" said Reed Kathrein, the Hagens Berman Partner leading the firm's probe.

Yet, for military families, the last several months have been a trainwreck even by comparison. TRICARE changes have led to several issues with claims, access to care, and other complications. It’s April 2025, and these issues are only getting worse for the community.

Over 16,000 Providers Have Unpaid Claims

Healthcare providers are having to drop patients and limit the healthcare services available to the military community as TRICARE issues continue to mount.

The contract changes that began when 2025 started have over 16,000 providers dealing with unpaid claims, and that’s just on the East Coast.

You’re likely aware by now that TRICARE undertook new regional contracts under TriWest and Humana Military.

Since doing so, patients, providers, and everyone in between has been dealing with the fallout.

Real Disruptions for Workers and Patients

Regardless of what business you’re operating, if you have $100,000 or more outstanding in payment, it’s going to affect your daily operations.

This is the reality clinics are living in now, which is causing some to take steps to handle these disruptions.

Some healthcare facilities are taking on debt, cutting staff members, and even refusing patients using TRICARE.

This means families who work in healthcare, as well as those who use TRICARE’s military insurance, are losing their livelihoods and access to care as a result. One notable example is Stephens Therapy Associates in San Diego.

Owned by Brenda Stephens, LPCC, LMHC, LPC, LCMHC, she has faced the unfortunate reality of taking out tens of thousands in loans, laying off staff, and halting mental healthcare services for 350 military families.

Behavioral health services are especially impacted by TRICARE’s issue, with clinics treating children, teens with autism, and Veterans with PTSD facing care gaps.

Families in Tennessee have lost access to care due to payment delays, hindering their health, and other states have reported potential closures for healthcare facilities needed by the military community.

Those With Autism Have Been Hit Hard

It’s safe to say the issues with TRICARE are affecting the military community as a whole, but those with children on the autism spectrum are facing major disruptions due to ongoing payment issues.

Treatment for kids with autism is already dicey for military families, and these disruptions only hurt their access even further.

Again, with clinics dropping clients, kids are left without essential services, including occupational or behavioral therapies that are vital to their well-being.

As a result, parents are already reporting heartbreaking regressions due to the lack of care, and even as technical issues are resolved, many providers are still unpaid, facing hard choices that affect families.

Why Are the TRICARE Issues Still Happening?

The government has had a quarter of the year to fix these issues, only to leave the healthcare industry and military community left to scramble.

There is still no clear end in sight, and the transparency has been non-existent for many.

This is causing military families to make hard choices, which could lead to a separation of service as they do what’s best for their families.

Others sell essential things, such as their vehicles, in order to cover the cost of healthcare when paying out of their own pockets.

Experts are warning that if TRICARE’s issues persist, the temporary access and payment problems involving military healthcare could get worse, limit availability to families, and force some facilities to move out of the network altogether.

What you need to know about rabies:

‒ It is an infection caused by a virus that is transmitted in the saliva of infected animals.

‒ It is transmitted by a bite or contact with infected saliva through open wounds, nose or mouth.

‒ Wild animals are the most likely potential source of rabies for both humans and pets.

‒ If you are bitten or scratched by an animal, it is critical you seek medical care immediately. Without proper treatment, rabies is almost always fatal.

All Active Duty and Tricare beneficiaries can be seen at the Medical Group. If you are seen off base, please follow-up with your Primary Care Manager because we still need to track the incident.

If you are a civilian, and it happened while at work, you can be evaluated at Operational Medicine Services, building 207. If you are a contractor, please seek care at your approved medical facility.

How to protect yourself and your pet:

‒ Vaccinate your pets against rabies.

‒ Avoid contact with stray or wild animals or any animal exhibiting unusual behaviors.

‒ Bat-proof your home.

‒ Teach your children how to protect themselves.

‒ Do not feed stray pets or wildlife.

“We are the only U.S. health care system that goes to war,” said Ferrara, who deployed four times when he served as an active-duty Navy surgeon.
“We have to support the warfighter, sustain our skills and strengthen our chain,” he said, adding that the chain is the continued evolution and modernization of the health care system to improve access, quality and safety.
He said the MHS optimizes warfighter performance by sustaining the readiness of the military force and those charged with their care and recovery.
This year, the Defense Health Program budget is approximately $61 billion, about 7% of the Pentagon’s topline budget.","APRIL 15, 2025 – For the Military Health System, readiness is a strategic imperative to ensure warfighter dominance, survivability and resilience, said Stephen Ferrara, performing the duties of the assistant secretary of defense for health affairs.

“Readiness cannot be secondary,” he said. “You cannot do readiness at the last minute. You cannot cram for readiness. When it comes to mission success, readiness is everything.”

Ferrara, appointed in January 2025, has delivered that message at speaking engagements, visits to military hospitals and clinics, town hall forums and interviews.

“We are the only U.S. health care system that goes to war,” said Ferrara, who deployed four times when he served as an active-duty Navy surgeon.

“When America’s sons and daughters go downrange and go into harm’s way, we honor the pact we made with them and with their parents, that should they become ill or injured, they will receive prompt and effective medical attention anywhere in the world,” he said. “That is the trust that we have. That’s something that our adversaries don’t always have, and it gives us an incredible strategic edge.”

Ferrara said his priorities for the Military Health System are increasing the lethality of the warfighter, sustaining the skills of the medical force and ensuring accessible, high-quality and sustainable care.

“We have to support the warfighter, sustain our skills and strengthen our chain,” he said, adding that the chain is the continued evolution and modernization of the health care system to improve access, quality and safety.

“If we support, sustain and strengthen, that is how we build a system that will fight and win because fundamentally, this is what our job is: to fight and win,” Ferrara said. “We do this by having a ready medical force so we can provide strong battlefield care and keep guns in the fight.”

Referring to readiness as both a medical and moral imperative, Ferrara noted that part of his role is conveying to Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth how the MHS is aligned with his priority of force lethality. He said the MHS optimizes warfighter performance by sustaining the readiness of the military force and those charged with their care and recovery.

This year, the Defense Health Program budget is approximately $61 billion, about 7% of the Pentagon’s topline budget. Ferrara said he uses that budget to make the force more lethal and more “fit to fight and win.”

“It starts with maintaining the ready medical force,” he explained. “We must ensure that every member of the team — from the surgeon who wields a scalpel, to the logistician who procured the scalpel; from the nurse who transfuses the blood, to the team who runs the blood bank — is at the top of their game. A team ready to go downrange to fight and win.”

Redirecting Funds to Strengthen Military Power Rather than simply cutting costs, the Pentagon plans to reinvest the saved $5.1 billion into critical defense projects.
For years, critics have pointed to excessive defense spending on consultants and nonessential programs as evidence of mismanagement.
Hegseth’s plan aims to tackle those critiques head-on, signaling a culture shift within the Pentagon toward leaner and smarter governance.","In a significant move to curb unnecessary spending and refocus its priorities, the U.S. Department of Defense has announced it will slash $5.1 billion worth of contracts. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth, spearheading the initiative, said the cuts are designed to reduce reliance on outside consultants and redirect those resources to core military functions, high-tech innovation, and national security.

With a staggering annual budget of $850 billion and nearly two million employees, the Pentagon is the largest federal agency. However, it has also come under repeated scrutiny for its sprawling expenditures and opaque budget practices. Hegseth’s latest cost-cutting push marks one of the boldest efforts in recent years to tackle these longstanding concerns.

Big Consulting Contracts Get the Axe

A major target of these cuts: high-dollar consulting agreements. Prominent firms like Accenture, Deloitte, and Booz Allen Hamilton will feel the impact, especially those providing services to the Defense Health Agency.

Hegseth took to social media platform X to explain that canceling these deals alone will save $1.8 billion. These contracts, he emphasized, often added little strategic value and duplicated tasks that could be handled internally.

Among the biggest cuts:

A $1.4 billion contract for cloud software reselling

A $500 million business consulting deal with the U.S. Navy

A $500 million DARPA contract for IT help-desk services, which Hegseth bluntly called “completely duplicative”

Bringing the Work Back Home

Hegseth’s message is clear: the Pentagon’s own personnel are capable of doing much of the work currently outsourced. In an internal memo, he stated that civilian employees and existing government systems can manage many of the services currently farmed out to consultants.

For example, the Air Force’s contract with Accenture for cloud IT procurement could be handled by in-house procurement experts, he argued. To put that plan into action, Hegseth has directed the Pentagon’s Chief Information Officer to team up with Elon Musk’s task force over the next month. Their mission: craft a strategy to shift IT consulting and management work back inside the department and ensure more competitive pricing on cloud services.

Cutting Back on Non-Military Spending

The cuts don’t stop at IT contracts. Hegseth has also axed several agreements tied to programs that he says stray from the Pentagon’s core mission. Funding for diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) initiatives, climate programs, and COVID-19 response efforts has been pulled.

“These issues might matter in other spaces, but within the Department of Defense, our job is to ensure military readiness and national security,” Hegseth said. “We can’t afford to be distracted or stretched thin.”

This stance marks a shift in how the Pentagon prioritizes spending, signaling a move away from broader policy initiatives and toward a laser focus on defense and preparedness.

Redirecting Funds to Strengthen Military Power

Rather than simply cutting costs, the Pentagon plans to reinvest the saved $5.1 billion into critical defense projects. The money will now support programs aimed at enhancing the country’s defense capabilities and technological edge.

Priority investments include:

Missile defense systems to counter emerging global threats

Hypersonic weapons development to stay ahead in strategic warfare

Artificial intelligence (AI) to improve logistics, decision-making, and battlefield intelligence

Cybersecurity enhancements to guard against increasing digital threats from foreign adversaries

According to Hegseth, these are the areas that will define the future of warfare—and where the U.S. must maintain an undisputed edge.

A Strategic Shift in Defense Thinking

This overhaul reflects a larger shift in how the Department of Defense is thinking about its operations and responsibilities. Instead of outsourcing tasks that its own people can do, the department is embracing a model of self-reliance, efficiency, and accountability.

For years, critics have pointed to excessive defense spending on consultants and nonessential programs as evidence of mismanagement. Hegseth’s plan aims to tackle those critiques head-on, signaling a culture shift within the Pentagon toward leaner and smarter governance.

Looking Ahead

In the coming weeks and months, the Pentagon will begin the process of transitioning responsibilities from contractors to internal staff. This will involve restructuring, retraining, and reevaluating how key functions are managed.

Meanwhile, negotiations with tech vendors and cloud providers are expected to result in more favorable contract terms, ultimately saving taxpayers even more money while ensuring the military gets what it needs.

While some experts caution there could be short-term disruptions, others see this shift as necessary and overdue. The long-term goal is a more focused, transparent, and agile defense force.",https://techstory.in/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/Screen-Shot-2016-08-15-at-3.05.39-PM-125x125.png,N,0.0,2025-04-15 11:56:21.101916

During that time, Swanson contributed to strategic policy execution, gaining firsthand experience in the operational aspects of Air Force Medical Service and assisting in the transfer of medical treatment facilities administration and management to the Defense Health Agency.

In the summer of 2023, Swanson began her DAF Legislative Fellowship, completing a six-month tour at the Department of State in the East Asian Pacific Bureau within the Legislative Affairs department. This was followed by a year-long fellowship in the U.S. House of Representatives with Congressman Rick McCormick (GA-06), a role in which she provided support for his work with the House Armed Services Committee.

Swanson viewed her role as a bridge between Airmen and policymakers, leveraging her experiences as an Air Force medic to foster an informed environment in drafting legislation related to the TRICARE health care program and gathering information about suicide prevention efforts within the AFMS community.

“It was a once-in-a-lifetime experience,” she said of her fellowship, and the unique opportunity to serve as the first defense policy fellow for McCormick’s office.

Swanson’s leadership experiences extend beyond policy to include community-building initiatives. She played a crucial role in the ONE Fairchild Initiative at Fairchild Air Force Base, Washington, fostering a sense of belonging for Airmen by creating support networks through interest-based clubs. Swanson led similar community efforts as chief of the disaster mental health team at Osan Air Base, Korea, and at Cannon Air Force Base, New Mexico.

“People everywhere just want to feel like they belong and that they are connected,” she explained. “It’s never just one person. It’s the people who become part of that community who continue to make it work.”

Reflecting on her career, Swanson emphasized the importance of leadership in driving meaningful change.

“I love leading people because I love understanding people, finding ways to bring people together and helping them meet their full potential,” she said. “In my career, the more I develop that skill, the better able I will be at ensuring that we take good care of our health care beneficiaries and our medics.”

Swanson provided advice, urging early and mid-career Airmen and Guardians to seek mentors who can share their wisdom and, most importantly, to view failure as a lesson for growth.

“Everybody's journey is different. Be willing to admit when you're wrong. Be willing to make changes and give yourself grace. And have fun along the way because it goes by very quickly.”

As Swanson continues to bridge the gap between military health and policy, her pursuit of enhancing health and readiness in the AFMS community exemplifies the Air Force’s principles of integrity first, service before self, and excellence in all they do.",https://d1ldvf68ux039x.cloudfront.net/thumbs/photos/2504/8974325/1000w_q95.jpg,N,0.0,2025-04-15 10:56:26.087749

Zynex’s Disappointing Fourth Quarter Results

ZYXI share price depression stems from its disastrous 4Q 2024 earnings release. The Englewood, Colorado-based firm reported fourth-quarter 2024 revenue of $46.0 million, a roughly 2% year-over-year decline, falling short of Wall Street's expectations. The company also swung to a net loss of $0.02 per share, a stark contrast to the $0.04 net income per share reported in the same period last year.

The disappointing results reportedly prompted RBC Capital Markets to downgrade Zynex to Sector Perform from Outperform. According to news outlets, in a report to its clients, RBC analyst Shagun Singh cited a ""lack of visibility"" into the company's operations and commercial outlook, particularly concerning its relationship with Tricare, the military health program that represents a significant portion of Zynex's revenue.

Singh reportedly noted that Tricare, Zynex's largest customer, has temporarily suspended payments amid an ongoing review of prior claims. Singh added that the company's decision to withhold 2025 guidance and implement a 15% workforce reduction further compounded investor concerns. Singh revised RBC’s price target for Zynex shares to $5.50, down from $11.00, warning of a potential ""domino effect"" stemming from Tricare's payment suspension.

Zynex Securities Class Action

Adding to Zynex’s woes, a securities class action lawsuit has been filed in the District Court of Colorado, alleging that the company made false and misleading statements regarding its revenue recognition practices and its relationship with Tricare. The suit, captioned Tuncel v. Zynex, Inc., et al., seeks to represent investors who purchased Zynex securities between March 13, 2023, and March 11, 2025.

The complaint alleges that Zynex engaged in “oversupplying” customers with products, including electrodes, leading to inflated revenue figures. It further claims that this practice drew scrutiny from insurers, including Tricare, and that Zynex failed to disclose the potential for adverse consequences, such as removal from insurer networks and government penalties.

According to the complaint, revelations of Zynex's alleged practices surfaced with a June 4, 2024 report by medical journal STAAT detailing an ""oversupplying scheme"" involving excessive shipments of supplies and subsequent inflated billing. The report also indicated that insurers were ""kicking the company out of network.""

The truth allegedly emerged on March 11, 2025, when Zynex reported its dismal Q4 and FY 2024 financial results. The complaint highlights Zynex CEO Thomas Sandgaard’s attributing the fourth-quarter revenue shortfall to ""slower than normal payments from certain payers"" and the Tricare payment suspension.

Hagens Berman’s Investigation

Hagens Berman is investigating the alleged claims. “We are examining Zynex's financial reporting and business practices. We believe investors deserve a complete and transparent understanding of these events,” said Reed Kathrein, the Hagens Berman Partner leading the firm's probe.

The emotional, financial, and physical demands placed on this group are immense, but when we look closely, one trend often stands out: the burden of caregiving typically falls disproportionately on daughters.

Why do daughters bear the weight of responsibility?

Historically and culturally, caregiving has often been seen as a woman’s responsibility. While attitudes are slowly shifting, many families still rely on daughters to shoulder the care for elderly parents. Daughters frequently find themselves arranging medical appointments, managing medications, supervising at-home care, and providing emotional support—all while maintaining their careers and caring for their own families.

This dual role can lead to significant stress, known as “caregiver burnout,” as women attempt to balance everything without compromising their loved ones’ wellbeing or neglecting their own personal needs. Adding to the already mounting ‘mental load’.

It’s not just about time and energy. Caregiving can take a toll on mental health, relationships, and financial stability. The sandwich generation is often forced to navigate the complexities of eldercare—such as finding affordable nursing homes or home-care services—while dealing with the rising costs of childcare for their children.

For daughters, this juggling act can mean sacrificing career advancement, personal hobbies, or even financial independence.

Empowering the Sandwich Generation

To ensure caregivers are supported, society must recognise their contributions and provide meaningful resources. Here are some ideas:

Advocate for Shared Responsibility: Families should work toward distributing caregiving tasks more equitably among siblings, rather than placing the burden solely on daughters.

Employ Workplace Support: Flexible hours, remote work options, and caregiving leave can make a significant difference for those balancing caregiving with a career.

Seek External Assistance: The Federal Government provides significant funding for support to keep residents in their homes for longer. MyAgedCare.com.au is a good place to start.

How can Retirement villages help?

Retirement villages can be a lifeline for the sandwich generation, offering much-needed support in several ways:

Relieving Caregiving Pressure: Retirement villages provide a safe and supportive environment for ageing parents, with access to healthcare, social activities, and assistance with daily tasks. This can ease the burden on family members who are juggling caregiving with their own responsibilities.

Promoting Independence: These communities are designed to help seniors maintain their independence while having access to help when needed. This can reduce the emotional strain on caregivers who may feel guilty about not being able to provide constant care.

Social Engagement: Loneliness can be a significant concern for ageing parents. Retirement villages have vibrant social calendars, helping residents stay active and connected, which can improve their overall well-being.

Flexible Care Options: Many retirement villages offer a range of care levels, from independent living to assisted care and nursing facilities. This flexibility allows families to adapt to their loved ones’ changing needs without having to relocate them.

Peace of Mind: Knowing that parents are in a secure and supportive environment can alleviate stress for the sandwich generation, allowing them to also focus on their children, careers, and personal lives.

By providing a structured and caring environment, retirement villages can help balance the demands placed on the sandwich generation, ensuring that both ageing parents and caregivers receive the support they need.",https://www.tricare.com.au/app/uploads/2025/04/Untitled-design-4.jpg,N,0.0,2025-04-15 18:56:58.371266

On Thursday, the Department of Defense announced that Hegseth had signed a memorandum directing the “termination” of $5.1 billion in “wasteful Defense Department contracts.” “That’s with a ‘B’—$5.1 billion in DOD contracts for ancillary things like consulting and other nonessential services,” Hegseth said in a video message on Thursday.
Hegseth explained that the Pentagon’s new cuts include $1.8 billion in consulting contracts previously awarded by the Defense Health Agency to Accenture, Booz Allen, Deloitte, and other private firms.
“That’s a lot of consulting.” READ MORE: Video: Pentagon cuts $580 million in ‘wasteful spending’ In the video message, Hegseth announced that the Pentagon is terminating a $500 million Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency contract for “IT help desk services that are completely duplicative services” provided by the Department of Defense’s Defense Information Systems Agency.

Hegseth explained that the Pentagon’s new cuts include $1.8 billion in consulting contracts previously awarded by the Defense Health Agency to Accenture, Booz Allen, Deloitte, and other private firms. The cuts also include a $1.4 billion contract for cloud information technology services that was awarded to a software reseller and a $500 million U.S. Navy contract for business process consulting.

“We need this money to spend on better health care for our warfighters and their families, instead of $500 an hour business process consultant,” Hegseth said. “That’s a lot of consulting.”

In the video message, Hegseth announced that the Pentagon is terminating a $500 million Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency contract for “IT help desk services that are completely duplicative services” provided by the Department of Defense’s Defense Information Systems Agency.

Additionally, Hegseth said the Department of Defense found 11 more diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) contracts, including the Pentagon’s COVID-19 response, climate change initiatives, and “nonessential activities,” that will be terminated.

“We are committed to rooting out DEI — root and branch — throughout this department,” Hegseth said. “And we found 11 more contracts, and we’re going to keep looking.”

Later in Thursday’s video, Hegseth added, “So if you’re keeping score at home, today’s cuts bring our running total to nearly $6 billion in wasteful spending over the first six weeks of the DOD-DOGE effort here at the Defense Department.”

Hegseth emphasized that DOGE’s “job” at the Department of Defense is to identify the “stuff” that the Pentagon can eliminate to better use the American taxpayers’ money for “war-fighting capabilities.”

The defense secretary concluded his video, saying, “We’re excited to make these cuts on behalf of you, the taxpayer, and the warfighters here at the department.”",https://americanmilitarynews.com/wp-content/uploads/16502572780_3c0cfd60ca_z.jpg,N,0.0,2025-04-14 19:56:26.636613

These changes focus on improving access to services, modernizing facilities, and addressing staffing shortages within the U.S. Department of Defense.

Enhancing Military Readiness

The MHS is implementing reforms aimed at enhancing military readiness by ensuring that service members receive timely and effective medical care.

This initiative underscores the importance of maintaining a healthy and prepared military force capable of responding to various challenges.

Stephen Ferrara, performing the duties of the assistant secretary of defense for health affairs, emphasized that readiness cannot be secondary.

He stated,

You cannot do readiness at the last minute. You cannot cram for readiness. When it comes to mission success, readiness is everything.

Modernizing Facilities

The FY 2025 budget allocates funds for modernizing military health facilities.

Improved infrastructure aims to provide better care environments for service members and their families.

These upgrades are essential for maintaining high standards in military healthcare delivery.

TRICARE Developments

TRICARE, the health program serving military personnel and their families, has undergone significant changes with new regional contractors.

These adjustments aim to improve access to specialized care and streamline healthcare services across different regions.

Addressing Staffing Challenges

The MHS is actively working to address staffing shortages within its facilities.

This effort includes recruiting qualified healthcare professionals to meet growing demands.

Adequate staffing levels are crucial for delivering timely medical attention worldwide.

MHS GENESIS Implementation

The implementation of MHS GENESIS, an advanced electronic health record system, is a critical component of ongoing reforms.

This system aims to enhance data management capabilities and improve patient care coordination across all branches of the military health system.

Parting Shot

The ongoing reforms within the Military Health System are vital for ensuring that U.S. service members receive top-notch medical care while maintaining operational readiness.

By focusing on modernization efforts and addressing staffing challenges, these initiatives contribute significantly to national security by supporting a resilient military force ready to face global challenges effectively.

If they now live more than 30 minutes but less than 100 miles away, they won't have to do anything to keep their Tricare Prime coverage and primary care manager.
If patients have moved more than 100 miles away from a Tricare Prime Service Area, they must decide within 90 days to switch to another plan.
""The Defense Health Agency to their credit has worked diligently with me, with the contract, to have those bills paid as quickly as possible.
But as we are continuing through this transformation, we are finding more and more places that we are challenged [to find] health care providers,"" Honea said.","Beneficiaries who live within 100 miles of a military hospital or clinic but at least 30 minutes away by car no longer need to request a waiver to stay with Tricare Prime, the Defense Department's managed-care health program.

Under the next-generation Tricare contracts that went into effect Jan. 1, patients who move to a location outside that access standard for primary care can choose to receive care at the DoD facility or, if they already receive care there, keep their primary care manager without seeking a waiver.

According to the Defense Health Agency, beneficiaries who meet the criteria will receive a letter notifying them that their homes are outside the access-standard measure, but if they don't respond, they will remain with their current primary care managers, or PCMs, at their military treatment facility.

Those who want to change primary care managers, however, can do so by following instructions in the letter.

""This new approach will help prevent unnecessary coverage gaps and ensure families keep access to their PCMs,"" said Shane Pham, a DHA management and program analyst, in a news release last week.

The change was among the requirements of the new contracts, known as T-5, which were issued to TriWest Healthcare Alliance in the Tricare West Region and Humana Military in the Tricare East Region on Jan. 1.

The allowance also coincides with an effort at the Defense Department to bring family members and military retirees back into military hospitals and clinics to ensure that the facilities have enough patients to maintain provider proficiency and curb the rising costs of private-sector care.

According to a memo issued Dec. 6, 2023, by then-Deputy Secretary of Defense Kathleen Hicks, the DoD hopes to increase the number of patients seen at military treatment facilities by 7% by the end of 2026, or a total of 3.3 million patients.

In a speech to uniformed and civilian federal health officials in March, Acting Assistant Secretary of Defense for Health Affairs Dr. Stephen Ferrara said the DoD is pursuing the efforts in order to create a high-functioning medical system.

""The last thing that a family or that service member needs is to be worried about whether their family is getting adequate or high-quality care,"" Ferrara said.

According to Tricare officials, the decision to drop the drive time waiver was made based on patient satisfaction surveys showing that many beneficiaries are willing to drive more than 30 minutes to keep their primary care doctors and would prefer not to switch physicians.

If a Tricare Prime beneficiary moves more than 30 minutes from their PCM, their Tricare regional contract will contact all adult patients in the household by phone, text, mail and email to provide options for continuing their health coverage.

Patients will have 90 days to decide what to do. If they now live more than 30 minutes but less than 100 miles away, they won't have to do anything to keep their Tricare Prime coverage and primary care manager. Or they can switch health plans -- to Tricare Select or the U.S. Family Health Program, if it is available in their region.

If patients have moved more than 100 miles away from a Tricare Prime Service Area, they must decide within 90 days to switch to another plan. They will be dropped from Tricare Prime after 90 days and will be able to be seen at a military hospital or clinic only if space is available.

Defense Health Agency officials urge all beneficiaries to ensure that their addresses are updated in the Defense Enrollment Eligibility Reporting System, or DEERS, and they also should check the email addresses and phone numbers the DoD has on file for accuracy.

Since the contract changeover Jan. 1, Tricare providers and patients have experienced disruptions to patient care and payments, resulting in patients having to switch providers or delay care and prompting providers to take out loans to pay staff while they wait for reimbursements.

The problems have caught the eye of lawmakers on Capitol Hill as well as military leadership, including the services' top enlisted leaders.

During a hearing last week before the House Appropriations subcommittee that oversees military construction, Master Chief Petty Officer of the Navy James Honea said he personally has received complaints from providers about the reimbursement delays.

""The Defense Health Agency to their credit has worked diligently with me, with the contract, to have those bills paid as quickly as possible. But as we are continuing through this transformation, we are finding more and more places that we are challenged [to find] health care providers,"" Honea said.

Last month, Republican Reps. John Rutherford and Aaron Bean of Florida wrote to David Smith, the acting DHA director, asking him to explain the delays and fix them.

""It would be unacceptable for military families to lose access to critical care coverage. This crisis must be immediately rectified,"" they wrote.

As Teyhen departs to serve as Director of Defense Health Network Indo-Pacific and Commanding General of Medical Readiness Command, Pacific, her blueprint for leadership remains.","After nearly two years of visionary leadership, U.S. Army Brig. Gen. Deydre Teyhen relinquished directorship of the Defense Health Network–National Capital Region on April 14, leaving behind a health system that is a benchmark for integration, innovation, and operational readiness within the Military Health System.

While the outcomes speak for themselves—higher patient satisfaction, increased virtual care, streamlined access, and a stronger, more connected workforce—Teyhen attributes it all to one essential ingredient: ‘how’.

“We often focus on the 5W’s: who, what, when, where, and why—but in the NCR, we focused on the ‘how,’” said Teyhen during her final remarks. “How we lead, how we build trust, and how we treat our people and patients. How is critical in leading the joy and soul back to medicine. Governance gave us the foundation to transform this network into an integrated healthcare system that focused on making it better for our patients and our staff.”

Teyhen championed a robust governance model that ensured every facility, specialty, and stakeholder had a seat at the table. Leaders from hospitals and clinics in the network were voting members on the Board of Directors, four systemwide committees, and 14 functional councils. The result was a culture of shared decision-making that accelerated alignment and eliminated roadblocks to execution.

This approach focused on bringing the joy and soul back to medicine enabled:

• 98% of capability and capacity changes to be implemented through formal governance pathways.

• Elimination of stand-alone decision-making, ensuring consistent follow-through across all sites.

• 2600+ missions processed, distributed, and closed—a testament to the network’s operational efficiency.

“Our governance process wasn’t a checkbox,” said Teyhen. “It was a strategy. It’s what enabled execution, collaboration, and ownership at every level.”

Dr. David Smith, Acting Director of the Defense Health Agency, underscored the far-reaching impact of this model.

“Brig. Gen. Teyhen embodies what effective, decisive leadership looks like,” said Smith. “She built a system where facilities weren’t just part of the network; they were the engine of it. Her leadership proves that when you empower those who are delivering health care every day, results follow.”

With governance guiding every initiative, the NCR reached historic highs across multiple operational fronts:

• Enrollment and Access: 12,000 additional patients enrolled; thousands of new primary care appointments added monthly. The improvements in access to care resulted in decreased use civilian urgent care clinics.

• Virtual Health: Expanded across the DHN-NCR from 22 to 154 clinics; 495 providers offering over 3,000 virtual visits per week.

• Surgical Optimization: Operating room utilization exceeded 81%, reaching the highest case volumes since 2022.

• Accreditation: Six successful Joint Commission surveys—including both Walter Reed National Military Medical Center and A.T. Augusta Military Medical Center—were completed without major findings.

• CMS Recognition: A.T. Augusta Military Medical Center earned 5-star status from CMS, placing it in the top 8% of hospitals nationwide.

• Graduate Medical Education: 98% first-time board pass rate across 51 programs.

Using governance to align specialties and streamline care delivery, DHN-NCR improved both internal operations and patient outcomes:

• Horizontal integration initiatives such as “mammograms while you wait,” over-the-counter prenatal vitamin access, and remote pharmacy activation removed barriers to care and improved health outcomes.

• Vertical integration across product lines like orthopedics and pulmonary ensured patients moved more seamlessly between their primary care and specialty care providers.

• A standardized bed report improved real-time patient flow, while credentialing and privileging processes were harmonized, reducing time to complete the privileging process by 34%.

Governance also played a role in transforming the region’s culture. Under Teyhen’s leadership:

• Burnout dropped 4% in less than 1 year, supported by frontline leadership training for more than 450 personnel and the launch of My Military Health huddle programs.

• Well-being was 39% higher among staff engaged in effective daily team huddles.

• Engagement survey participation rose to 67%, far exceeding the industry standard.

In communications, all 34 MTFs focused on improving our patients’ ability to navigate the healthcare system. A redesigned patient guidebook served as the foundation for beneficiary education, while outreach campaigns for MHS GENESIS and My Military Health helped staff and patients transition confidently to new digital platforms.

As Teyhen departs to serve as Director of Defense Health Network Indo-Pacific and Commanding General of Medical Readiness Command, Pacific, her blueprint for leadership remains.

“I’ve had many incredible roles, but the NCR was special,” Teyhen said. “Because here, I got to lead a team that believed the ‘how’ matters—that excellence, trust, and compassion aren’t just values, but ways of doing the work. We worked hard to bring the joy and soul back to medicine. And we did it together.”",https://cdn.dvidshub.net/images/dvids_logo.svg,N,1.0,2025-04-14 16:56:20.175644

Steele Sr. Chapter in Arlington, Va., hosted a “Financial Readiness Bootcamp” for 25 Arnold Air Society students, Airmen from the 317th Recruiting Squadron, and more on April 2, 2025. The event was held in recognition of National Financial Literacy Month, observed each April to promote smart money habits and lifelong financial well-being.

Military members face unique financial challenges including frequent moves, complex pay structures, and the stress of deployments, all of which can all lead to financial strain. Many young Airmen and Guardians enter service with limited financial education and are vulnerable to predatory lending or poor money habits. This makes early financial readiness training critical for both individual well-being and mission success.

Among the 25 attendees was a strong turnout from the Arnold Air Society squadrons at the University of Maryland and Howard University. Members of the Steele Chapter and the 317th Recruiting Squadron were also in attendance, including Brig. Gen. Houston Cantwell, USAF (Ret.), a senior resident fellow at the Mitchell Institute for Aerospace Studies.

The event was hosted at Nighthawk Pizza, a Community Partner of the Steele Chapter located downstairs from AFA’s national operations center.

Chapter Secretary Bob Hill, a 25-year Air Force veteran and former financial advisor for 24 years, led the workshop. His session focused on military-specific financial topics such as basic pay, special pay, allowances, TRICARE, SGLI, and the Thrift Savings Plan. He then introduced key personal finance principles: budgeting, saving, debt management, and long-term investing.

“You need to focus the same Airman’s discipline expected of you as a professional to your personal finances,” Hill emphasized. He encouraged cadets to “pay yourself first,” live below their means, and always plan for the unexpected. Hill also reminded participants that the most important word in the event’s title is “Readiness.”

“The Air Force and Space Force expect you to lead, to serve, and to complete the mission. You can’t do that if financial stress is holding you back,” he said.

Programs like the Financial Readiness Bootcamp equip future Airmen and Guardians with the tools to make smart decisions, reduce stress, and stay mission-ready. As one student said, “Every cadet needs to hear this important information and take action.”

The chapter plans to offer more Financial Readiness Bootcamps in the future to support the next generation of Airmen and Guardians.",https://www.afa.org/app/uploads/2025/04/Steele-Financial-Bootcamp-1.jpeg,N,0.0,2025-04-14 18:56:29.366188

""We are the only U.S. health care system that goes to war,"" said Ferrara, who deployed four times when he served as an active-duty Navy surgeon.
Ferrara said his priorities for the Military Health System are increasing the lethality of the warfighter, sustaining the skills of the medical force and ensuring accessible, high-quality and sustainable care.
""We do this by having a ready medical force so we can provide strong battlefield care and keep guns in the fight.""

""Readiness cannot be secondary,"" he said. ""You cannot do readiness at the last minute. You cannot cram for readiness. When it comes to mission success, readiness is everything.""

Ferrara, appointed in January 2025, has delivered that message at speaking engagements, visits to military hospitals and clinics, town hall forums and interviews.

""We are the only U.S. health care system that goes to war,"" said Ferrara, who deployed four times when he served as an active-duty Navy surgeon.

""When America's sons and daughters go downrange and go into harm's way, we honor the pact we made with them and with their parents, that should they become ill or injured, they will receive prompt and effective medical attention anywhere in the world,"" he said. ""That is the trust that we have. That's something that our adversaries don't always have, and it gives us an incredible strategic edge.""

Ferrara said his priorities for the Military Health System are increasing the lethality of the warfighter, sustaining the skills of the medical force and ensuring accessible, high-quality and sustainable care.

""We have to support the warfighter, sustain our skills and strengthen our chain,"" he said, adding that the chain is the continued evolution and modernization of the health care system to improve access, quality and safety.

""If we support, sustain and strengthen, that is how we build a system that will fight and win because fundamentally, this is what our job is: to fight and win,"" Ferrara said. ""We do this by having a ready medical force so we can provide strong battlefield care and keep guns in the fight.""

Referring to readiness as both a medical and moral imperative, Ferrara noted that part of his role is conveying to Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth how the MHS is aligned with his priority of force lethality. He said the MHS optimizes warfighter performance by sustaining the readiness of the military force and those charged with their care and recovery.

This year, the Defense Health Program budget is approximately $61 billion, about 7% of the Pentagon's topline budget. Ferrara said he uses that budget to make the force more lethal and more ""fit to fight and win.""

""It starts with maintaining the ready medical force,"" he explained. ""We must ensure that every member of the team — from the surgeon who wields a scalpel, to the logistician who procured the scalpel; from the nurse who transfuses the blood, to the team who runs the blood bank — is at the top of their game.

“And that’s where it causes that really characteristic, painful rash.” What are the first signs of shingles?
How does the shingles vaccine work?
And the shingles vaccine could help prevent dementia.
If you’ve recently had shingles, Felley said most doctors will wait for a year before giving you the vaccine.","About one in three people in the United States will get shingles during their lifetime, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

It’s not deadly, but there is a painful rash that lingers for two to four weeks. The most common complication is postherpetic neuralgia, which is long-term nerve pain that lasts for months to years after the rash clears.

Dr. Laura Felley is an infectious disease physician at Emplify Health in La Crosse. She treats the most serious cases of shingles where the virus has traveled to the central nervous system, causing meningitis or encephalitis.

WPR’s “The Larry Meiller Show” recently talked about shingles with Felley. Here are the biggest takeaways from the discussion.

What is shingles, and what causes it?

The Varicella zoster virus causes shingles, Felley said. It’s a herpes virus — the same one behind chickenpox and meningitis.

After you’ve had chicken pox, the virus takes root in your nerves. There, it can stay dormant for decades until a change or stress to your immune system awakens the virus.

“When the virus wakes back up, it travels down along the nerve root to the skin,” Felley said. “And that’s where it causes that really characteristic, painful rash.”

What are the first signs of shingles?

There are a few warning signs of shingles before the rash appears on the skin. You might experience prodromal pain, Felley said. That’s pain or tingling under the skin where the rash will eventually develop, typically in stripes on one side of the body.

Additionally, the CDC website says you might also run a fever.

Felley said it’s important to get to the doctor as soon as you notice the beginning of the painful rash. Taking prescribed oral antivirals within 72 hours of the rash’s appearance might clear the rash quicker and reduce the amount of pain you experience.

“Being vigilant and not being shy about talking to your doctor, [that] things just aren’t feeling right is really the way to go,” Felley said.

How does the shingles vaccine work?

Essentially, the shingles vaccine bolsters your immune system’s response to the virus. The CDC says the Shingrix formulation is 90 percent effective at preventing shingles and postherpetic neuralgia in adults ages 50 and older with healthy immune systems.

Felley recommended getting the vaccine after age 50 because you lose your immunity to the initial chicken pox infection you suffered as a child. If you have a weakened immune system, you might get the vaccine earlier than 50.

The vaccine is a series of two shots, Felley said. Get the second dose within two to six months of receiving the first. You only need to get it once — it’s not needed annually like the flu shot.

The shot might cause irritation or swelling at the injection site. Felley said up to 10 percent of people experience systemic reactions like muscle pain, fatigue or a headache.

“I view it as just a very small investment of your time overall to prevent some real misery later on,” Felley said.

And the shingles vaccine could help prevent dementia. A study out of Wales shows that people who received an older formulation of the vaccine were 20 percent less likely to develop dementia over time than those who were unvaccinated.

If you’ve recently had shingles, Felley said most doctors will wait for a year before giving you the vaccine.

What about taking care of the rash?

Keep the rash clean, covered and don’t let anyone touch it, Felley said. The open sores provide a way for the virus to spread to others.

The rash will crust over in seven to 10 days.

“It can take a little while for the scabs to fall off after that,” Felley said. “Do not pick at them. Just leave them be. They will fall off on their own, even if they’re itchy.”",https://www.wpr.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/town-center-pharmacist-angelina-cox-prepares-a-dose-9b14d7.jpg,N,0.0,2025-04-14 15:56:36.028502

To receive an emergency refill of prescription medications, TRICARE beneficiaries should take their prescription bottle to any TRICARE retail network pharmacy. If the bottle is unavailable or the label is damaged or missing, beneficiaries should contact Express Scripts, Inc., or their retail network pharmacy for assistance.

To find a network pharmacy, beneficiaries may call Express Scripts at 1-877-363-1303, or search the network pharmacy locator.

If possible, visit the pharmacy where the prescription was filled. Prescriptions filled by a retail chain may be filled at another store in that chain. If the clinician who prescribed the medication is available, beneficiaries can ask them to call in a new prescription to any network pharmacy.

As a reminder, TRICARE beneficiaries, other than active duty service members, may receive urgent care from any TRICARE-authorized urgent care center or provider and do not need a referral. This allows beneficiaries to seek nonemergency care for illnesses or injuries if their primary care provider is unavailable because of emergencies. Any TRICARE beneficiary who reasonably believes they have an emergency should always call 911 or, go to the nearest emergency room.

Beneficiaries are advised to visit Express Scripts’ Weather Notices page for updates.

Maj. Michael Dills presented Anandzi, Choi, Fantone, and Terrell with the Sergeant Major’s and Commander's Coins for their accomplishments.
“It didn't seem to me like any of the Soldiers who didn’t earn the badge had any reservations about going again.","FORT DETRICK, Md. – Four Soldiers from the U.S. Army Medical Research Institute of Chemical Defense and U.S. Army Medical Research Institute of Chemical Defense earned the prestigious Expert Field Medical Badge following a grueling five-day competition earlier this month at Fort Walker, Virginia that tested their combat skills as well as their ability to deliver cutting-edge life-saving medical care in a variety of austere scenarios – vital skills for ensuring our forces remain resilient, adaptable, and lethal.

Brig. Gen. Lance Raney, commanding general of Medical Readiness Command-East, pinned the EFMB on Capt. Seung Choi and Capt. James Terrell of USAMRICD and Staff Sgt. David Anandzi and Capt. Kayla Fantone of USAMRIID at a ceremony following the competition on April 2. Fantone had the additional distinction of getting perfect scores on all her tests – popularly referred to as earning the EFMB with “No Blood.”

A total of seven Defense Health Agency Research and Development-Medical Research and Development Command teammates from USAMRIID, USAMRICD, and the Walter Reed Army Institute of Research competed in the event, which consists of an expert physical fitness assessment, a written test, a 12-mile ruck march, exercises for evaluating evacuation and warrior skills and day and night land navigation exercises. The Army's Medical Center of Excellence, which developed the EFMB tests, describes their purpose as measuring ""a Soldier's physical fitness and ability to perform to standards of excellent in a broad spectrum of critical medical, evacuation and warrior skills.""

The EFMB is notoriously hard to earn; the overall pass rate is typically less than 30%. Earning the badge is a demonstration of the recipients’ achievement of a high standard of readiness.

“EFMB testing is designed to be stressful,” says Choi, a research biochemist who earned the EFMB on his first attempt. “It’s often just you and a stone-faced grader while you navigate and perform the tasks in front of you. It could be warm and sunny outside, but the air is cold and stiff, the testing area is completely silent, and you find yourself second-guessing your approach, your knowledge, and your instincts. There’s almost no room for error, and any little mistake could potentially be your last.”

The competitors singled out the cadre for praise for their support throughout the training and competition weeks. The sharing of knowledge and expertise among peers is an important technique for improving Warfighter resilience, adaptability, and lethality.

“The instructors really wanted all of us to succeed,” says Terrell, a research biochemist for whom this was his second attempt to earn the badge. “They spent lots of extra time with us in study halls, and if anybody had any questions, they were out there with us. They were also at the testing site 24/7. It's not like they went to a hotel or back to their house every night. They were going through it with us, which was really cool.”

Fantone, a microbiologist who earned the EFMB on her first attempt, says that having a good attitude, being open to learning and putting in a lot of effort are crucial for improving the odds of success – characteristics that are vital for meeting the Army’s high standards of readiness for both individuals as well as at the unit level.

“The EFMB will humble you and find your weaknesses,” says Fantone. “But that's what I like about it. It was fun because you actually learn your weaknesses as well as your strengths out there, and discover what you need to work on.”

A common theme among EFMB competitors is how the experience energizes them to tackle the next career challenge and continue honing and improving their Warfighter and medical skill sets, such as pursuing Air Assault, Airborne, or Ranger badges.

“You get such a drive to do it while you're there, you have to forget about everything else,” says Anandzi, the NCO In Charge of USAMRIID’s Pathology Division. “There is so much to remember in such a short period of time that once you start to realize that you can actually do this, then it's like oxygen. You just want to go back and just keep it. You practice so much that you can’t get it out of your head afterward!”

Following the award ceremony, MRDC’s Command Sgt. Maj. Michael Dills presented Anandzi, Choi, Fantone, and Terrell with the Sergeant Major’s and Commander's Coins for their accomplishments.

“I think everybody who went through the competition had a rewarding experience,” says Terrell. “It didn't seem to me like any of the Soldiers who didn’t earn the badge had any reservations about going again. All of them had the shared mentality of, ‘I will definitely be back!’”",https://d1ldvf68ux039x.cloudfront.net/thumbs/photos/2504/8972752/1000w_q95.jpg,N,0.0,2025-04-14 12:56:21.295736

What are common upper extremity injuries?
Military injury data indicate that among the upper extremities, the shoulder is the most commonly injured body area.
Shoulder injuries can be more severe and require a longer recovery period than lower extremity injuries.
Over two-thirds (69%) of military injuries are cumulative microtraumatic injuries that result from overuse.","Service members experience 25 million limited duty days annually due to injuries, most of which are musculoskeletal injuries, also known as MSKI.

When on limited duty status, a service member may not be able to maintain required training activities and may not be deployable. As a result, the combat readiness of the U.S. military forces is substantially reduced by MSKI, costing the Department of Defense billions of dollars annually.

“For decades, the data have consistently shown that MSKI are the primary reason for service members’ medical visits,” says Dr. Bruce Jones, a retired Army physician and current senior advisor to the Defense Health Agency-Public Health Clinical Public Health and Epidemiology Directorate in Aberdeen, Maryland. “Though MSKI most commonly occur in lower body areas such as the knees, legs, ankles and feet, approximately 20% of all military medically reported injuries are to upper extremity areas, such as to shoulders, elbows, wrists, hands and fingers.”

Upper extremity injuries require unique recovery treatments that are most effective when tailored to an individual’s injury, as well as their specific work and personal activities. This treatment is provided by military Occupational Therapists Practitioners, known as OTPs, who are trained to treat service members’ upper extremity injuries from shoulders to fingertips.

“The treatment of an upper extremity injury depends on many factors: how long ago the injury occurred, the overall health of the service member, and compliance with the treatment plan,” says U.S. Army Maj. Amanda Hetzler, an OTP currently assigned to DHA-Public Health in Aberdeen.

She points to evidence that early access to OT is the leading factor in reducing a patient’s recovery time.

“The sooner we can start working with an injured service member, the better outcomes can be,” says Hetzler.

What are common upper extremity injuries?

Military injury data indicate that among the upper extremities, the shoulder is the most commonly injured body area.

Some units may be at higher risk of these injuries. For example, an analysis of medical data found that compared to other service members, military paratroopers have been treated for more acute shoulder injuries, such as fractures, sprains or dislocations of the shoulder or acromioclavicular joint (where the shoulder and collarbone meet). The data also showed paratroopers were more likely to develop shoulder overuse injuries than non-paratroopers. Shoulder injuries can be more severe and require a longer recovery period than lower extremity injuries.

While Hetzler says she also often sees acute, or single incident, pain injuries to the wrist or hand caused by a fall on outstretched hands while a service member is running and carrying gear, most injuries she has seen in the military population are the result of overuse.

Overuse injuries occur from a repeated, low-intensity force over time that damages tendon, joint, ligament, muscle and/or skeletal tissue, overwhelming the tissue’s normal ability to recover. Over two-thirds (69%) of military injuries are cumulative microtraumatic injuries that result from overuse.

Hetzler describes other upper extremity overuse injuries commonly treated by OTs:

Thumb and wrist pain, including de Quervain's Tenosynovitis and Gamer’s thumb: Also sometimes called de Quervain's tendinosis or de Quervain's tendinitis, this condition occurs when thumb tendons become inflamed and cause pain and swelling at the base of thumb into the side of the wrist or lower arm. Symptoms can include numbness and/or a sensation that your thumb is sticking when you try to move it.

Elbow and forearm pain, especially Lateral Epicondylitis: Also referred to as elbow tendonitis or sometimes tennis elbow, this condition causes pain in the affected forearm when you’re trying to complete ordinary movements such as gripping or holding even relatively light objects, turning knobs, driving, typing, or shaking hands.

What causes upper body injuries?

“Overuse injuries can be attributed to various activities that require repetitive motion such as pushing, pulling, and lifting and can also be impacted by ergonomics, tool use, and the overall strength and condition of a person,” says U.S. Navy Lt. Cmdr. Emmy Hartley, an OTP currently assigned to Naval Hospital Pensacola, Florida.

Some upper body diagnoses such as ‘Gamer’s thumb’ are commonly given due to the many cases in the U.S. that are caused by excessive use of video game remote control devices and cell phones. The term ‘tennis elbow’ is frequently used because of the popularity of racquet sports that contribute to repetitive strain on the wrist, causing the condition. Although the condition ‘tennis elbow’ may be diagnosed for service members, it is rarely caused by tennis play within the military population.

“More relevant to the military, evidence has shown that certain occupations that require intense repetitive physical activity, such as shooting rifles, performing mechanic work, or carrying objects during military tasks, can increase the risk of certain upper body injuries,” says Hartley.

In addition to unique mission activities such as paratrooper duties, Hetzler recalls patients describing some examples of triggering military activities:

Pushups

Weightlifting (especially ‘snatching,’ which involves taking a wide grip on a weighted barbell, pulling it off the floor rapidly, and lifting the barbell over the head with arms outstretched in one continuous motion, placing stress on the wrist.)

Lifting of gear (loading and unloading)

“While these activities are often critical to military training or duties, the patient can often not perform them while injured,” says Hetzler. “In addition, a key part of most OT treatment plans will require a recovery period where these activities should not be performed.”

What can you do to minimize the impact of an upper extremity injury?

“The best way to reduce the impact of an injury is to prevent it from occurring. Most injuries, especially overuse injuries, are preventable,” says Jones. “Various military resources are available to help service members target key injury risk factors and improve service member readiness by reducing injury risk.”

These resources can help service members avoid injuries while maximizing fitness, and allow early accessibility to an OTP. For example, some Army units are including Holistic Health and Fitness, known as H2F, teams into their brigade formations, while Navy and Marine units have the Navy Operational Fitness and Fueling System, or NOFFS.

“If you develop a MSKI or experience painful symptoms not yet limiting you, seek immediate care,” says Hetzler. “With delayed care or a lack of proper intervention, injuries can result in reduced readiness of the unit, limited military career progression or worse—permanent disability.”

Hetzler and Hartley also highlight that OTPs can provide activity analysis of specific tasks, such as lifting, pushups, and body mechanics, while the task is being performed. These analyses result in preventive education and training that can further reduce the risk of MSKI.

“The most important step is early diagnosis and referral to an OT who will help develop and monitor your treatment plan. Especially, don’t ignore pain in joints,” says Hetzler. “Once you are under the care of an OT, of course, you need to follow the treatment plan. This is the best way to reduce your chance of a longer recovery or permanent condition.”

A memo from Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth on reducing the department’s spending on contracts stresses using the department’s own employees instead—so-called “contracting in.”

The memo lists several contracts recently terminated including ones with the Defense Health Agency for consulting services “that can be performed by our civilian workforce”; one with the Air Force for cloud IT procurement “which we can already fulfill directly with existing procurement resources”; and a DARPA contract for IT helpdesk services “that are duplicative with service capabilities of our existing DISA workforce.”

“These contracts represent non-essential spending on third party consultants to perform services more efficiently performed by the highly skilled members of our DoD workforce using existing resources,” it says.

Federal unions long have advocated for agencies to examine whether work performed by contractors could be done more efficiently and at less cost by federal employees—the opposite of “contracting-out” in which agencies study in-house costs for comparison against private sector bidders.

Hegseth’s memo follows by days one in which DoD set policies on consolidating and eliminating offices and civilian jobs under a directive telling components to conduct a review of their organizational structures and workforces.

Among numerous other provisions, that guidance says that “all functions that are not inherently governmental ( e.g., retail sales and recreation) should be prioritized for privatization.”

Want to learn more about our Stafford Lakes Village or any of our Retirement Living Communities?","The Holt Bolt program at TriCare Stafford Lakes is bridging generations, giving young people of all abilities real-world work experience while enriching the community.

At TriCare’s Stafford Lakes Retirement Community, something wonderful is happening. Every Thursday morning, a group of bright, enthusiastic young people arrive, ready to roll up their sleeves and get to work. But these aren’t just any workers – they’re part of The Holt Bolt School Leavers Employment Support Program, a life-changing initiative that helps young people with disabilities gain real-world work experience. And let’s just say, the TriCare residents have taken them in as their own.

It all started with a simple conversation. Andrea Lambie, the Village Manager at Stafford Lakes, recalls the day Toni Sutherland walked into her office. Toni, a mentor with The Holt Bolt, was looking for local area opportunities for a group of school leavers to gain work experience.

“She explained how the program works and we spoke about the kinds of tasks they could help with, and soon enough, we had three young people joining us every week.”

Now, the program has grown to four participants, and the impact has been enormous – not just for The Holt Bolt trainees, but for the entire Stafford Lakes Retirement Community.

What is The Holt Bolt School Leaver Employment Support Program Program?

Originally starting as a personal training facility, The Holt Bolt has evolved into something much bigger. Offering exercise physiology sports programs and personal training, the NDIS-approved service is also dedicated to helping young people with disabilities transition from school into the workforce. Over two years, participants develop essential life and employment skills in real-world settings, setting them up for greater independence and future job opportunities.

Their mission is to identify the talents of the people they work with and create pathways and opportunities for them to share their talents and passions with their community.

Each week, Holt Bolt trainees are placed in various workplaces, including cafés, opportunity/ thrifts shops, and businesses like TriCare, where they get hands-on experience in different roles. For many, this is the first step toward long-term employment, and as Andrea points out, “They just bring so much joy and energy to the place.”

Meet The Holt Bolters

At Stafford Lakes, The Holt Bolt participants take on a range of jobs – and it turns out they’ve got some serious skills.

Take Hannah, for example. “She’ll try anything,” Andrea says. “She’s been cleaning the fountain, planting flowers, working in the salon – she’s just so happy to give everything a go.”

Then there’s Cooper, who quickly revealed a knack for attention to detail. “On his very first day, he was spotting all the fire exits and defibrillators. He just remembers everything,” Andrea says. “So now, I’m thinking of getting him involved in some of our safety audits because he’s an exceptional eye for detail.” He is excellent with supporting our office administration work.

There’s Tommy who helps in the café, serving coffees and chatting with the community. He is passionate about delivery excellent customer service and with his social personality has made him a hit with the residents.

Josh is the newest recruit. He’s a car and fitness enthusiast and really has enjoyed hand on tasks and working with tools.

The ripple effect

What makes this program truly special is the impact it has on both sides of the generational divide. For The Holt Bolt trainees, it’s a chance to build confidence, develop skills, and gain a sense of independence. But for the residents, it’s a source of joy, connection, and a reminder of the vibrancy of youth.

“Our residents absolutely love them,” Andrea says. “They stop and chat, they share stories. It’s not just about the work they do – it’s about the relationships they build. Having young people around creates such a wonderful energy in the community.”

Beyond that, the trainees are genuinely very helpful in our busy environment. “They take on real jobs,” Andrea points out. “They’re collecting bottles and cans for recycling, putting together sales brochures, delivering mail, helping in the café – they’re making a real contribution to our community at Stafford Lakes .”

Looking to the future

As the current cohort continues on their two-year program, we look forward to seeing the team grow their passions and gain skills for their future employment. Programs like this aren’t just about training – they’re about connection, belonging, and proving that everyone has something valuable to contribute. And at Stafford Lakes, that’s something they’ve embraced wholeheartedly.

When it comes to caring for ageing loved ones, families can sometimes find themselves navigating a complex array of care choices. At TriCare, we understand the emotional journey of finding the right support, whether that’s considering home care packages or exploring Residential Aged Care options.

Understanding care options

Many families initially explore home care packages as a first step. While these services can provide temporary support, they aren’t always the comprehensive solution that seniors with increasing care needs may require.

Home care: Limitations and challenges

Home care packages may be helpful in the early days of needing extra support, but they come with significant considerations that may come into play in the longer term:

1. Limited support

Home care services typically offer intermittent assistance, which may not provide the comprehensive continued support needed as care requirements intensify. Seniors might receive just a few hours of support per week, leaving significant gaps in care.

2. Mounting home modifications

As care needs increase, homes often require costly modifications, such as:

Safety railings

Stair lifts

Bathroom adaptations

Specialised equipment.

These modifications can quickly become expensive and may not ultimately solve increasing care challenges.

3. Carer fatigue

Families attempting to manage home care often experience significant emotional and physical strain. The responsibility of coordinating care, managing rosters, and supporting a loved one can be overwhelming.

When home care isn’t enough

Clear signs that Residential Aged Care might be a good option include:

Increasing complex medical needs

Safety concerns at home

Significant challenges with daily living activities

Isolation and reduced social interaction

Respite Care: A valuable transition option

For families hesitant about moving straight to permanent Residential Aged Care, Respite Care offers a valuable “try before you buy” experience. TriCare’s Respite Care services provide:

Additionally, he leads risk assessments, strategic reports and cost-saving initiatives to enhance mission readiness and ensure regulatory compliance.

Before accepting a position at Ecompex, Dr. Marchi was employed as a knowledge management analyst for the U.S. Army Medical Center of Excellence (MEDCoE) in 2023. From 2018 to 2021, he served as a U.S. Army Critical Care at 1Prospect Technologies. Dr. Marchi gained valuable experience during his 21-year military career and held several positions while serving in the U.S. Army, working as a flight paramedic and critical care program manager from 2016 to 2018, a combat medic training program manager from 2014 to 2016, the director of clinical practice for the Army air ambulance unit from 2006 to 2014 and health clinic manager and treatment coordinator from 1997 to 2006.

Dr. Marchi holds a Doctor of Health Sciences in leadership in clinical practice and education from The George Washington University, a Master of Science in occupational safety and health from Columbia Southern University and a Bachelor of Science in health science from Purdue University Global.

He maintains memberships with the National Association for Healthcare Quality, the Board of Certified Safety Professionals, the American Hospital Association and the National Association of EMS Educators. He has published articles in journals associated with EMS World and the Medical Center of Excellence.

Dr. Marchi's most notable career achievement occurred while working with a service that facilitated an international collaboration between aeromedical evacuation paramedics and nurses. The goal was to enhance the combat efficiency of the current U.S. Black Hawk helicopter platform, which is capable of accommodating six litter patients and utilizing one U.S. flight paramedic. The team established new policies to support this collaboration and clarified jurisdiction over pharmaceuticals and liabilities between U.S. and Norwegian forces. Dr. Marchi collaborated closely with the Commanders to successfully plan and implement a groundbreaking joint international initiative. This initiative entailed deploying a UH-60 aeromedical evacuation platform, staffed with one U.S. flight paramedic and one Norwegian flight nurse, to enhance support combat operations in Afghanistan. The collaboration extended to Norwegian forces, with General David H. Petraeus visiting the location to observe the efforts. The Secretary of Defense of Norway and the Chief of the Swedish Air Force also came to witness the collaboration. This was significant for Sweden because, at the time, discussions were underway regarding the purchase of either UH60 Black Hawk or NH90 helicopters.

For his accomplishments while in the U.S. Army, Dr. Marchi was awarded the Meritorious Service Medal, five Air Medals, six Army Commendation Medals and a Combat Medical Badge. These experiences sharpened his ability to lead dynamic teams, implement resilient performance strategies, and drive high-stakes decision-making.

Dr. Marchi attributes his success to his resilience and tenacity. He is firmly convinced that achieving the highest quality of patient care is not only possible but essential when healthcare professionals are empowered with the necessary knowledge, resources, and institutional support to uphold rigorous standards of practice, continuously improve their skills, and cultivate a culture of compassionate, evidence-based care. Looking toward the future, Dr. Marchi hopes to secure a role in shaping healthcare policies that will lead to enhanced community health outcomes and an improved healthcare system, particularly in the context of Veterans' Affairs. Dr. Marchi is also developing a leadership philosophy called the Learning Leader, which integrates education and leadership.

That’s because non-compliance can result in business disruption, productivity losses, fines, penalties, and settlement costs, among other factors that come with a hefty price tag. Even data breaches are more expensive if an organization is non-compliant.

In recent years, organizations across various sectors have faced significant fines for non-compliance with regulations such as HIPAA, GDPR, and CCPA.

The high cost of regulatory non-compliance

Regulatory non-compliance can result in financial penalties ranging from thousands to millions of dollars.

European regulators imposed €4.48 billion in fines across 2,086 cases, mainly targeting insufficient legal grounds for data processing and inadequate security measures. Companies lacking comprehensive data governance frameworks were hit hardest. For example, the GDPR can impose fines of up to 4% of a company’s annual global revenue for violations. This was the case for Meta, which was fined €1.2 billion in 2023 for having an insufficient legal basis for data processing. This remains the largest GDPR fine to date.

Regulatory bodies may take legal action, leading to lawsuits or criminal charges. For instance, companies that commit financial fraud under SOX may face criminal prosecution, and executives can be personally held liable.

In June 2024, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) issued more than $500,000 in SOX penalties and fines to the former chief financial officer at Synchronoss Technologies for allegedly falsifying financial statements and lying to the company’s auditor. This came after Synchronoss reached a $12.5 million settlement with the SEC for engaging in “long-running accounting improprieties” in June 2022.

Contracts and funding depend on regulatory compliance

Businesses may face restrictions, such as losing the ability to process transactions or operate in certain markets. For example, a payment processor found in violation of PCI DSS requirements may be prohibited from handling credit card transactions, impacting revenue and customer trust.

Organizations that fail to comply with government regulations may lose contracts or funding opportunities.

For example, in February 2025, the military health benefits administrator Health Net Federal Services (HNFS) agreed to pay $11.2 million to settle allegations that the company falsely certified compliance with cybersecurity requirements for three years in a contract with the U.S. Department of Defense to administer the TRICARE program. In addition to paying that fine, they also lost their TRICARE West Region contract.

Many businesses require their partners and vendors to maintain strict compliance standards, and these often go beyond regulatory requirements to include commercial frameworks like SOC 2. Enterprises that have strong security and privacy standards may refuse to work with vendors who fail to meet those standards, resulting in lost revenue and missed growth opportunities.

HIPAA penalties linked to data protection failures

According to the US Department of Health and Human Services’ (HHS) Enforcement Highlights, they have received nearly 375,000 complaints since the compliance date of the Privacy Rule in April 2003. Analysis of $144.9 million in HIPAA fines reveals that inadequate safeguards for electronic protected health information (ePHI) were the primary cause.

Multiple breaches exposing sensitive patient data, such as Montefiore Medical Center’s $4.75 million settlement, resulted in the largest penalties.

California’s increasing focus on privacy led to substantial fines for companies that failed to provide required consumer opt-out mechanisms or mishandled data access requests. This signals a trend toward stricter enforcement in the future.

In March 2025, the California Privacy Protection Agency fined Honda $632,500 for making it unnecessarily difficult for consumers to exercise their privacy rights, such as opting out of data sharing.",https://img.helpnetsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/26142115/compliance.jpg,N,0.0,2025-04-14 01:56:18.391241
