Kristina Johnson's family is one such family. Her husband is in the Navy. They live in Virginia Beach. News 3 met Johnson as she was taking her three-year-old daughter, Sophia, to receive applied behavior analysis services.

Applied behavior analysis, or ABA, is a type of therapy for people with autism.

It helps Sophia identify things and communicate her wants and needs. But the therapy isn’t easy to come by for military families.

“I think it’s definitely stressful,"" Johnson said about the struggle to get her daughter the service.

TRICARE, the military's health insurance provider, doesn’t offer ABA as a basic service like many civilian insurance providers do. That means military families have more steps to go through to get the services.

A frustrating hurdle for families, knowing how beneficial the services can be.

“Ever since she’s started, she’s grown and hit milestones that I know if she were not here I would be, like, ‘What am I supposed to do about this?’"" Johnson said.

In September, the National Academies of Science, Engineering, and Medicine released a report on the study the organization did of the military health care system’s current process for providing the services.

One goal of the study was to determine if TRICARE should offer ABA as a basic service. According to the report, the answer is yes.

Johnson is excited.

“I grew up with a nephew and a brother who are on the spectrum and saw how my parents kind of struggled with that,"" Johnson explained.

The report also recommends ways to improve ABA policy, implementation, and oversight.

The NCAAS is a national advocacy organization. Kornack also works for the Center for Autism and Related Disorders.

“a I’m hopeful that the Congressional Autism Caucus and the many members of that do see this report and decide that they can put some pressure on the Department of Defense or take other action,"" Kornack said.

At first, Senate Democrats blocked the measure.
The final vote passed easily, with the majority of Democrats joining all but three Republicans to approve the bill.
While the NDAA isn’t technically an appropriations bill, its annual passage and ties to defense funding make it an important bellwether.","Over the past two weeks, the shutdown fight has dominated Washington, leaving a stack of fiscal year 2026 appropriations bills waiting for their turn at the negotiating table. As LGBTQ+ people have watched nervously to see whether Democrats would hold the line against anti-trans and anti-queer riders, another “must-pass” measure has quietly advanced through Congress: the National Defense Authorization Act. In 2024, the NDAA became the vehicle for one of the most consequential betrayals of transgender Americans by national Democrats in recent memory, after Democrats allowed provisions targeting trans military family members and dependents to stand when they had control of the Senate and White House. This year, history is repeating itself. After weeks of delay amid the shutdown chaos, Senate Democrats on Tuesday night dropped key objections and allowed a vote to proceed on the bill—ultimately passing the Senate version of the bill, complete with anti-trans culture-war riders, an anti-DEI clause, and no limits on the domestic deployment of U.S. troops.

The bill, which cleared the Senate 77–20 last night, sets the rules for how the military operates and spends its money. Traditionally, the NDAA has avoided the culture-war baggage that weighs down other legislation. But in recent years, Republicans have turned it into a vehicle for their favorite grievances—and this year is no exception. The Senate version includes three key provisions targeting LGBTQ+ people: a ban on transgender participation in sports at military academies, extending even to visiting students in intercollegiate competitions; a prohibition on Defense Department funding for gender-affirming surgeries, which could also sweep in defense contractors as well as trans military spouses; and a measure gutting equal opportunity and diversity protections across the armed forces.

At first, Senate Democrats blocked the measure. But by Tuesday night, Republicans and Democrats had struck a deal to move it forward. Rather than demand that key provisions be stripped or amended, Democrats opted for a series of doomed amendment votes—symbolic gestures that allowed them to register dissent without altering the bill’s substance. Among them was a proposal from Sen. Tammy Duckworth to restrict the president’s ability to deploy U.S. troops on domestic soil without congressional approval, a flashpoint issue amid recent military mobilizations in major American cities. The final vote passed easily, with the majority of Democrats joining all but three Republicans to approve the bill.

Democratic senators voting in favor of the NDAA included Angela Alsobrooks of Maryland; Michael Bennet and John Hickenlooper of Colorado; Richard Blumenthal of Connecticut; Lisa Blunt Rochester and Chris Coons of Delaware; Ruben Gallego and Mark Kelly of Arizona; Jon Ossoff and Raphael Warnock of Georgia; Mazie Hirono of Hawaii; Gary Peters and Elissa Slotkin of Michigan; Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota; Jacky Rosen of Nevada; Maggie Hassan and Jeanne Shaheen of New Hampshire; Martin Heinrich and Ben Ray Luján of New Mexico; Kirsten Gillibrand and Chuck Schumer of New York; John Fetterman of Pennsylvania; Jack Reed and Sheldon Whitehouse of Rhode Island; and Tim Kaine and Mark Warner of Virginia.

Democratic senators who voted against or did not vote on the NDAA included Tammy Baldwin of Wisconsin; Cory Booker and Andy Kim of New Jersey; Maria Cantwell and Patty Murray of Washington; Tammy Duckworth and Dick Durbin of Illinois; Ed Markey and Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts; Jeff Merkley and Ron Wyden of Oregon; Chris Murphy of Connecticut; Alex Padilla and Adam Schiff of California; Brian Schatz of Hawaii; Tina Smith of Minnesota; Chris Van Hollen of Maryland; and Peter Welch of Vermont. Independent senators Bernie Sanders of Vermont also voted no. Catherine Cortez Masto of Nevada did not vote.

The bill now heads into conference negotiations with the House, where the version passed earlier this year is loaded with even more anti-trans and anti-LGBTQ+ riders. Many of those measures were championed by Rep. Nancy Mace, who infamously launched into anti-trans slurs on the House floor during debate. The House provisions go far beyond the Senate’s, including an all-ages ban on military health insurance coverage for gender-affirming care, restrictions on transgender athletes at military facilities, a bathroom ban on bases, a ban on pride flags, and a clause excluding gender identity from all military data collection. According to Roll Call, the Senate’s passage sets the stage for formal conference talks where negotiators could fold some—or all—of the House provisions into the final bill. The legislation will then return to both chambers for final approval and will likely reach the president’s desk before year’s end.

The Senate’s capitulation on LGBTQ+, DEI, and other provisions may offer an early preview of its priorities in the broader shutdown fight. The government has now been shuttered for ten days, with Democrats and Republicans deadlocked over both a clean continuing resolution and full-year funding bills for 2026—many of which are packed with anti-trans and anti-LGBTQ+ riders. While the NDAA isn’t technically an appropriations bill, its annual passage and ties to defense funding make it an important bellwether. Earlier this month, as the shutdown loomed, LGBTQ+ advocates flooded congressional offices with calls urging lawmakers to strip anti-LGBTQ+ riders from all must-pass legislation. For now, those provisions take a backseat in the shutdown talks as such talks currently center primarily on a short-term continuing resolution—but the NDAA marks the first break in that line of defense, and it’s likely to test the limits of how far Democrats are willing to go to defend equality and civil rights when the fiscal year 2026 funding bills are finally negotiated.

The National Women’s Law Center condemned passage of the NDAA with the anti-trans and anti-DEI provisions in a press release this morning, stating, “Mere days before service members are set to miss a paycheck because of the government shutdown, Senate Republicans continue to ignore the national health care crisis and find new ways to inject ideological priorities into what should be bipartisan efforts to strengthen our armed forces and support military families. The NDAA bill includes harmful amendments that will deny gender-affirming surgical care to service members and adult dependents in military families, bar transgender women from sports at service academies, and gut protections that ensure equal opportunity. These measures are cruel, unnecessary, and do nothing to make our country safer. Instead, they hurt the very people who serve it and deter potential recruits from a career in service to this nation, ultimately weakening our military and compromising our national security. Such provisions that divide our military have no place in the final bill, and Congress must act to strip out these provisions before final passage.”

This is not the first time Senate Democrats have approved anti-transgender riders to national bills. In 2024, with control of the Senate and the Presidency, they passed a National Defense Authorization Act that contained a Tricare ban for gender affirming care for children dependents. Senate Leadership refused to hold a vote to remove that provision led by Senator Baldwin of Wisconsin, with GLAAD condemning the measure at the time.","https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!0zGi!,w_1200,h_600,c_fill,f_jpg,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep,g_auto/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F93149be2-3ee9-4605-a458-6cb1ea49d469_3070x2048.jpeg",N,0.0,2025-10-10 17:56:43.139454

Installation Support: Base-specific services like Child Development Centers (CDCs) and Morale, Welfare, and Recreation (MWR) programs are generally determined by the installation commander. Many remain open, but staffing and services may be limited.

Important Considerations:

Communication with creditors: Inform your landlord, mortgage lender, and utility providers about a potential disruption in pay to request extensions or special payment arrangements.

Contact local resources: Check with your installation's Family Readiness Center or other on-base support agencies for the latest information on locally available services and resources.

Avoid scams: Be cautious of individuals and groups exploiting the shutdown. Use official military aid societies and reputable organizations for assistance.",https://murphy.house.gov/profiles/evo/assets/images/favicon.ico,N,0.0,2025-10-10 17:56:48.362288

One Virginia Beach business told 10 On Your Side they are feeling the impacts of the ongoing shutdown because they say TRICARE isn’t paying up.

Speech at The Beach owner Ashley Causey said about 40% of their clientele use Tricare to pay. But she said they stopped receiving payments from the military insurance carrier around the time the government shutdown, without any warning.

“I was personally confused,” Causey said. “Like, is this happening to anyone else? Because I wasn’t hearing or seeing anything about it.”

Causey said they used to receive payments daily. She reached out to TRICARE, who she said told her that claims won’t be paid out until the shutdown ends.

She said the loss so far has been substantial.

“I just wanted to put it out there, because I don’t think many people know how impactful this is to everyone,” Causey said, “not just direct government employees, but also, maybe small businesses that accept TRICARE, or families that have TRICARE, it’s eventually going to impact them as well.”

This isn’t the first time local providers, including Causey, have had issues with Tricare.

10 On Your Side reported in the spring that a company named PGBA LLC began processing claims for the Tricare East Region, which caused many providers to go without pay and answers.

“Our payment was delayed and delayed and delayed,” Causey said, “and we realized it was because of the switch in payers. Again, it was very little communication. And I think that one took about two months to get some payments.”

The TRICARE website acknowledges that there could be potential delays in payment during the shutdown.

A spokesperson from Humana Military did send 10 On Your Side the following statement in response to our inquiry about the situation:

“Without knowing the specifics of each provider’s claims, we cannot comment on why their claims have not yet been paid. We are partnering with the Defense Health Agency (DHA) to minimize the impact of the government shutdown as much as possible on providers and beneficiaries. Certain claims are paid directly by the government, and those will not generally be paid during the shutdown as there isn’t funding to pay them. Other claims are paid in advance by Humana Military and then Humana Military is paid back by the government. For those types of claims, Humana Military is continuing to pay providers. We recognize how challenging this is for providers and beneficiaries. We recommend providers continue to submit claims so Humana Military can make sure they’re processed and paid quickly once the shutdown ends.”

— Nan Frient, Communications Lead for Humana Military

Causey is hoping they can get payments soon.

“We are just monitoring things,” Causey said. “Hopefully we’ll be able to remain doing therapy as normal, but obviously that’s going to be something that we have to monitor financials to make sure that we can stay afloat as a small business.”",https://www.wavy.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2025/10/VB-BUSINESS-TRICARE-SHUTDOWN-ISSUES-LLPKG.00_00_28_19.Still001.jpg?w=1280,N,0.0,2025-10-10 12:57:28.090578

One local clinic serving military families with special needs children says it has reached a financial breaking point.

Genevieve Covington is the CEO and Founder of Bloom Behavioral Solutions located right outside naval station Mayport. The clinic provides care to about 70 families whose children are living with autism, down syndrome, cerebral palsy and ADD/ADHD. 90% of the families they serve are military.

This business which employs more than 40 people is classified as an autism care demonstration under TRICARE, the military’s health insurance system.

The latest government shutdown has frozen funding. Since the program is not a covered medical benefit, it isn’t protected during a shutdown.

That means no payments, since September 23rd and no timeline on when they’ll resume.

""Now I am left with this horrific decision of do I continue to provide services. I have no idea when this government shutdown will end,” said Genevieve Covington, board certified behavioral analyst and CEO of bloom behavioral solutions.

Covington said this isn’t the first challenge her small business has faced.

Back in January, a TRICARE contract transition left providers waiting 90 days without reimbursement, something they’re still recovering from.

On Thursday, the CEO sent this letter to families she serves, explaining the financial situation:

""If services were to be placed on hold, these families are going to have to navigate having their children at home instead of being in our facility receiving the services they require,” said Covington.

Now with no answers and no end in sight, Covington is left making tough choices.

""Do I continue to provide services? I absolutely have to. I'm under a contractual obligation unless I give 45-days’ notice to the TRICARE beneficiaries,” she said.",https://media.firstcoastnews.com/assets/WTLV/images/c0e7f62c-e5c4-4eba-9d8f-361aafe257e5/20251010T033749/c0e7f62c-e5c4-4eba-9d8f-361aafe257e5_1140x641.jpg,N,0.0,2025-10-10 00:56:34.018529

Addiction Treatment Covered by TRICARE Insurance

TRICARE covers treatment services that are proven to be safe, effective, and medically necessary for your condition. Experimental or unproven therapies are generally not included, and some exclusions or special coverage rules may apply. However, addiction and mental health treatment services are typically well-supported under TRICARE benefits.

As an in-network provider with TRICARE Select, Excellence Recovery offers coverage for a variety of evidence-based addiction treatment programs and therapies, including the options listed below. These services are designed to help clients achieve lasting recovery with the full support of their insurance benefits.

Withdrawal Management (Detoxification)

TRICARE covers medically supervised withdrawal management and related services designed to reduce the symptoms of substance withdrawal safely and effectively. These services are typically provided by authorized inpatient facilities, residential treatment centers, or partial hospitalization and intensive outpatient programs.

For clients requiring medical detox or medication-assisted treatment (MAT), TRICARE includes coverage when care is delivered by certified providers authorized to prescribe and monitor medications such as buprenorphine (Suboxone). Preauthorization is not usually required for MAT services.

While Excellence Recovery does not provide on-site detox services, our admissions team can help coordinate withdrawal management with trusted TRICARE-approved providers before transitioning you into residential care. This ensures a safe and seamless start to your recovery process.

Inpatient Rehab

TRICARE provides coverage for residential substance use disorder treatment at authorized inpatient facilities when medically necessary. Preauthorization is required, and approval is typically granted for individuals diagnosed with a substance use disorder or those experiencing symptoms that require 24-hour clinical care and physician supervision.

Inpatient psychiatric treatment is also covered under TRICARE for individuals needing stabilization, evaluation, or treatment of mental health conditions. Like residential rehab, these services require preauthorization since they are considered nonemergency care.

At Excellence Recovery, our admissions team assists with the verification and preauthorization process to ensure your residential treatment is approved and aligned with your TRICARE plan’s benefits.

Outpatient Services

For individuals who need ongoing support for mental health or substance use concerns but do not require full-time residential care, TRICARE also covers various outpatient treatment options.

The project has been in the works for years, but local leaders suddenly face mounting pressure to assemble the funding as other jobs look poised to leave.

DHA manages medical enterprise services for the U.S. military around the world and has roughly 130,000 employees across the country, including a headquarters in Falls Church, Va.

Two years ago that gave San Antonio a strategic advantage when the Biden Administration was looking for opportunities to save money, and the Air Force deemed Joint Base San Antonio-Fort Sam Houston its “preferred location” for a DHA consolidation to cheaper digs.

“They were looking for a place where they could get out of high-cost leases, to include Falls Church and Washington, D.C.,” retired Maj. Gen. Juan Ayala, the director of San Antonio’s Office of Military and Veteran Affairs, told San Antonio’s City Council Thursday. “They picked San Antonio … [but] the building at Fort Sam requires major renovation, major modernization.”

Since then, the Trump administration has undergone its own cost saving initiatives, including an Army inefficiency reduction in which preliminary recommendations call for about 200 positions at Fort Sam Houston to move to North Carolina.

The DHA consolidation is expected to bring more than triple that many new jobs to San Antonio, but Ayala said there’s no timeline until funding for the renovation is secured.

And like all economic development negotiations, leaders stress the situation is delicate — particularly when politics are involved.

“Now the Department of War is making some decisions about how best to invest in and protect the country,” Mayor Gina Ortiz Jones said Thursday. “We have to adjust accordingly.”

Preliminary work has already gone into assessing what it will take to convert what’s known as the South Beach Pavilion into a modern office. The historic, four-story building was built in the 1930s and later used as a hospital during WWII.

That location would put the agency near Brooke Army Medical Center (BAMC) — in a city that’s also home to the U.S. Army Institute of Surgical Research and a growing health and bioscience industry.

Plans are already underway to make sure the region capitalizes on other military medical installments and private investments that are expected to follow.

For example, the nonprofit VelocityTX envisions the agency becoming an “anchor tenant” for the seven-acre G.J. Sutton property just a block south of the redeveloped Merchants Ice building.

“This has been a tangible investment. It is something that we’ve committed to,” Ayala told the council Thursday. “Every uniform that comes to our city is a job, … [plus] the folks that come with them … go to school, buy houses, go to grocery stores. These kinds of things infuse millions of dollars in the local economy.”

Despite tight budgets, this year the city and Bexar County put a total of $20 million aside to help accommodate renovations at Fort Sam Houston. On Thursday the council voted unanimously to seek state funding as well, something the county plans to do soon.

DHA did not respond to a request for comment Thursday due to the ongoing government shutdown.

Fresh off a role at the Pentagon, where she was involved in such spending and efficiency conversations, Jones stressed the need for San Antonio to be seen as a team player for the new administration’s goals.

“Having been on the other side of this, it’s about, how do we make sure folks understand we are ready and willing to partner?” she said.",https://sanantonioreport.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/NorthSouthBeach_HowitzerRoad_JBSA_FortSamHouston_Courtesy_02-scaled.jpg,N,0.0,2025-10-09 17:56:37.793188

“They will have started reorganizing their household costs around affording the higher price tag for their health insurance.""","For months, as the expiration of health insurance subsidies loomed, state health insurance commissioners warned Congress that millions of middle-class Americans were likely to see their insurance premiums double or triple.

Now, Washington is at a stalemate. The government has closed.

Democrats say Congress needs to permanently extend the credits now before open enrollment for state health insurance marketplaces begins Nov. 1. Republicans say they will not discuss health policy as part of a bill to reopen the government and can deal with the subsidies before they expire Dec. 31.

But the reality on the ground is that people are already being notified of the expected cost increases. Insurance companies have submitted their rates and open enrollment begins in less than a month, leaving little time to make adjustments.

“People see that December 31st date, but it really is that people are making decisions within weeks from now,” said Devon Trolley, executive director of Pennie, Pennsylvania's insurance marketplace.

Trolley said it will be “chaotic” and “messy” if Congress waits to act until open enrollment begins, and even worse if lawmakers wait until the end of the year.

“The cleanest, most cost-effective, most beneficial time to do it is right now, before open enrollment starts,” she said.

Even if Congress does act to extend the tax subsidies later this year or early in the next, insurance commissioners fear the damage will have been done and at least hundreds of thousands of Americans will be newly uninsured.

Impact didn't sneak up

The National Association of Insurance Commissioners sent four letters to Congress this year and commissioners visited repeatedly in person, pleading with Senate and Democratic leaders of both parties to act.

“It’s not like it snuck up on us,” said Oklahoma Insurance Commissioner Glen Mulready, chair of the association's Health Insurance and Managed Care Committee.

In those months of talking with Congress, the association urged representatives and senators to at least scale back the subsidies over a few years so people would have time to find a way to pay for the increase. Instead, they are facing a cliff, Mulready said.

The insurance commissioners association's president, Jon Godfread, who is also North Dakota's insurance commissioner, said every state commissioner told their delegations what the cost of not extending the enhanced subsidies will be for their states.

“I don't know of a single insurance commissioner ‒ red state, blue state, wherever, elected, appointed ‒ that doesn't support the continuation of these tax credits,” Godfread said.

Until recently, the deadline felt far away, he said. It was hard to get Congress to listen.

“I feel like I spent the entire month of May in DC talking to Congress on this issue,” Godfread said. ""As with everything it feels like these days in DC, you've got to wait till the very deadline to make some movement on this stuff.”

Trolley, of Pennsylvania, said she begged Congress for certainty so insurance companies and consumers would have time to plan.

""Congressional vehicle after vehicle has passed without any updates, and this is really kind of the last train leaving the station before people make those decisions,” she said.

Congress fighting over ‒ and maybe starting to budge on ‒ health care

Democrats say they are taking one of the few open opportunities as the minority party to push back on the GOP's health care changes. Democrats also want to undo large-scale Medicaid cuts this summer in the Republicans' tax and spending bill.

Republicans say Democrats are holding the government hostage over a topic that doesn't need to be resolved in the midst of a crisis and that discussions of what to do about the subsidies can wait.

“We have effectively three months to negotiate. In the White House and in the halls of Congress, that’s like an eternity,” House Speaker Mike Johnson, a Louisiana Republican, told MSNBC’s Ali Vitali on Oct. 6.

There is some behind-the-scenes movement. A bipartisan group of senators has begun quietly meeting to find a path forward, and cracks in the Republican position are starting to show.

On Oct. 6, Georgia Republican Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, who opposes the Affordable Care Act, broke with House leaders in supporting extending the subsidies.

That same day, President Donald Trump indicated to reporters that the subsidies might be a negotiating point in reopening the government.

""We have a negotiation going on with the Democrats that could lead to good things,"" Trump said. ""And I'm talking about good things with regard to health care.""

Godfread is still hopeful Congress will extend the subsidies before open enrollment begins in most states Nov. 1 or at least early in the enrollment window.

“The challenge we have right now is the timing of it all,” Godfread said. “We are up against the absolute deadline.”

Subsidized health coverage for 24 million Americans at stake

The enhanced premium tax credits are a product of the COVID-19 pandemic, when Congress expanded who could get a subsidy to help people buy insurance on the marketplace in an effort to get as many Americans insured as possible.

The enhanced tax credits increased subsidies for eligible people and expanded eligibility to include those making more than four times the federal poverty level. In 2025, that figure is $62,600 for an individual or $124,800 for a family of four.

Americans flocked to buy insurance with the subsidies. The number of people purchasing insurance through the marketplace has more than doubled since 2020. The majority of users are in states that voted for Trump in 2024, like Florida, Georgia and Texas, according to KFF, a nonprofit health policy institute.

About 92% of the 24.3 million Americans who use the marketplace receive a subsidy of some amount, according to KFF. If Congress doesn't act and the credits expire at the end of 2025, out-of-pocket premiums would rise by more than 75% on average.

Two sets of rates established

Because of the uncertainty, many states asked insurance companies for two sets of rates: one for if the enhanced subsidies ended, the other if Congress acted to extend them.

""We really built our planning around a go-no-go of Sept. 30,” said Covered California Executive Director Jessica Altman.

The no-enhanced-subsidy rates were loaded into their system when the government closed that day and California began mailing out personalized renewal information ‒ including expected costs without the enhanced subsidies ‒ to the 2 million people who purchase insurance through the marketplace.

""If you think about this from the consumer perspective and the moment in time when they're understanding this impact and making decisions based on that impact, not only is it happening in November, they actually start to find out about it in October,” she said.

In Oklahoma, “we were sort of holding off in pushing forward real education to the consumers, kind of hoping and thinking that something might change or something might come about. But for our state that wait has ended. We've got to be communicating out to folks,” Mulready said.

Insurance companies determined their rates expecting that with lower or no subsidies, younger and healthier people will not purchase insurance, leaving an older and less healthy pool of people ‒ a group that will cost more to cover because they have chronic conditions, or more severe health needs.

""The ones who need health coverage because their life literally depends on it ‒ it's their cancer treatments, it's medications that are keeping their seizures at bay, like literally, it is life or death for them to stay on health coverage ‒ they will continue to stay, find a way to stay enrolled,"" Trolley said.

Without the enhanced subsidies, most people who purchase through the marketplace will see their premiums double, if not more. KFF has a calculator that people can use to estimate how their costs could change based on state, ZIP code, income and family size.

“We are anticipating that people, even as soon as (Nov. 1), will have to make the tough decision that they cannot afford to stay covered for 2026 because of the significant premium increases,” Trolley said.

Who uses the marketplace?

About half of users are small business owners, self-employed people and people who work for a small business, according to KFF.

""By definition, we serve people who don't have the privilege of the type of work that offers a stable job with stable benefits where the employer is paying a large portion of the cost of their health insurance,"" Altman said. That includes parents of young kids working part-time in the gig economy, entrepreneurs and early retirees too young for Medicare, she said.

Godfread said he has stressed to his North Dakota delegation that farmers, ranchers, small business owners and their employees make up a large percentage of people who buy on the exchange. They don’t have access to health care through any other means such as through an employer, Medicare, Medicaid or Tricare, he said.

“A lot of these folks who these subsidies are impacting are the ones who are moving our economy forward,” Godfread said.

Even if Congress acts soon, delays and confusion are likely

Marketplaces and consumers face a drawn-out, costly process if Congress waits until December or later to act on the subsidies, Trolley said.

If Congress extends the enhanced premium tax credits, the lower rates pitched by insurance companies based on having a larger pool of consumers can be implemented and all people who buy on the marketplace ‒ not just those who get the enhanced subsidies ‒ are expected to see their rates go down.

But it could take a month or two to input the lower rates provided by insurance companies and then inform consumers that rates have changed, Trolley said.

""Even just to update everything would probably take into January or February in order to give people a chance to update their premiums and update their information,"" Trolley said. “It'll be very disruptive to do that after people have already selected. It would be very messy.""

In some cases, people will have already had to sit with the stress of a difficult choice for weeks if not months, Altman said.

“They will have started reorganizing their household costs around affording the higher price tag for their health insurance."" Altman said. Some will have switched to high-deductible plans. ""And some consumers will have said, I just can't do it, and walked away.""

Commissioners fear those people won't return, Mulready said.

Mulready said Oklahoma is expecting at least a third of the 300,000 people who purchased from the marketplace last year to skip it this year.

Trolley expects 150,000 of the 500,000 people using Pennie will go uninsured without the enhanced premiums, and she fears the marketplace's outreach if the subsidies are extended won't be considered credible.

California expects 400,000 of the 2 million people on the marketplace to walk away and while the state is setting aside money to win them back through text messages, emails, letters and calls if Congress acts, Altman said she doubts all will return.

“If that scenario plays out where tax breaks are extended in December, or at the end of the year, early next year, we will have lost people for coverage for what ends up being no reason other than Congress failed to act soon enough.”

DEERS sees that you came off orders at the end of September so you're currently covered under TAMP. It's your assignment that's fucking you up. The date needs to be reflected correctly so your eligibility is fixed. Your unit won't be able to fix that at their level. Especially if the assignment is already complete.

The other option is just just ride out the TAMP coverage and enroll on your spouse's plan at the end of that, though being OCONUS that would probably be difficult as most MFTs won't see reservists without specific authorization.",,N,0.0,2025-10-09 13:56:40.323433

Finding cancer early can provide more treatment options and improve the potential for better outcomes. While traditional screenings, such as colonoscopies, mammograms, and skin checks, remain essential, they only cover a limited number of cancers. According to the American Cancer Society, roughly three out of four cancer-related deaths in the U.S. are from cancers that have no routine screening options. The Galleri test helps close that gap by using a simple blood draw to screen for multiple cancers at once.

""Early detection can make all the difference in cancer care,"" said Michael Fitzgerald, MD, a primary care physician with Duly Health and Care. ""The Galleri test gives us another tool to help patients take a proactive approach to their health. With just one blood draw, we can screen for many cancers before there are symptoms. This one test helps us catch potential concerns earlier than ever before.""

If a cancer signal is detected, the Galleri test can also predict where the signal may have originated, helping guide next steps in diagnosis and treatment planning.

""We know the incidence of certain cancers is on the rise in the United States, increasing the importance of diagnostics and prevention,"" said Brian Myre, MD, oncologist and director of the Brian Moran Cancer Institute at Duly Health and Care. ""While we have made major advancements in cancer treatments, we must also focus on improving detection and prevention. The Galleri test has the potential to play a meaningful role in this pursuit.""

The Galleri test is recommended for adults with an elevated risk for cancer, such as those aged 50 and older. It is available in addition to regular cancer screenings advised by each patient's primary care provider.

With the addition of this test, Duly Health and Care reaffirms its mission to provide innovative, accessible, and patient-centered care that empowers patients to take action toward healthier, longer lives.

The Galleri test is available as a $749 cash-pay option for Duly patients or is covered by TRICARE® health plans for eligible patients ages 50 and up. Patients may be able to use pretax dollars in their flexible spending account (FSA) or health savings account (HSA) to pay for the Galleri test. Patients should check with their FSA/HSA administrator or insurance provider to determine eligibility.

The Defense Health Agency (DHA) announced on Tuesday, TRICARE may not be able to pay for service claims after October 1.

Practice owners who accept TRICARE say the government shutdown has them in a turnstile. Local doctors' offices say they're doing their best to stay afloat as money gets tight.

Doctors and practices that accept TRICARE say their practices are at the mercy of the government as the government shutdown stretches into day nine.

""I think that this is going to have far-reaching effects because it potentially is affecting families all across the United States,"" said Mission Alpha Advocacy CEO, Kristi Cabiao. ""That's millions of families. It's not only the active duty but it's retirees. It's anybody who receives TRICARE benefits.""

Dr. Britt Sims is the executive director of Integrated Behavior Solutions. It's a practice geared toward serving families of children with developmental disorders.

The practice was struggling before the shutdown because of backlogged payments from TriWest.

""We've spent the year exhausting every option just to stay open, and now those options are gone,"" Sims said.

The practice is missing out on roughly $200,000 dating back to January 1st. We first spoke to him in April; he shared he took out around $180,000 in loans to stay afloat.

Now he's making cutbacks. On Wednesday, he told employees today they'll be furloughed starting Monday.

""We can last a couple of weeks on what I have personally.. but now. I'm done. I'm spent,"" The military spouse said. ""If, by some miracle, something happens, then I don't know. We'll keep fighting somehow.""

""Because of all of this, everything is completely stalled and halted,"" said Dr. Gia Koehne. ""We have a lot of families that need services, and we just don't have the capacity to be able to do that, because we're not getting paid.""

She also owns a small practice called the Blossom Center for Children. It serves autistic children. She has $500,000 in loans to pay back.

Things are getting tight.

""We don't even know if we're able to continue to take TRICARE and to be able to sustain our practices using TRICARE as a funding source,"" Koehne said.

""Even just a pause of a few days, that means that there may be a backlog resulting in weeks of getting these payments out to providers,"" Cabiao said. She's also a military spouse, and mother of a child with special needs.

They're all asking the community to look at the bigger picture.

""Families are losing critical services and employees, you know -- Americans that have a heart for this are going to be out of a job,"" Sims explained.

We reached out to the DHA for answers about what the shutdown means for struggling practices. No one was available to speak to us.

Officials with TriWest say they're committed to returning to their 'current performance' as quickly as possible after the shutdown ends.

FULL TRIWEST STATEMENT:

""TriWest is a proud partner to the Department of Defense in serving West Region beneficiaries. Due to the current lapse in government funding, there may be delays in medical claims payments until funding is restored. Our company’s objective during this period is to pay within the contractual standard, and we remain committed to returning to our current performance as quickly as possible once the shutdown has ended and funding resumes. Providers may continue to care for beneficiaries and submit claims per normal business practice.
