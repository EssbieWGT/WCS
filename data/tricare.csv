Obesity is more than just carrying around a few extra pounds—it is a complex chronic condition that puts individuals at a higher risk of serious health issues, such as hypertension (high blood pressure), Type 2 diabetes, stroke, and certain mental health conditions.

These concerns, along with a desire to lose weight, are why weight loss medications are becoming more commonplace. While prescription weight loss medications have been on the market for decades, such as phentermine, the newer GLP-1s, including Ozempic (used off-label for weight loss) and Wegovy, have been generally shown to be more effective than previous treatments.

Each health insurance company has different guidelines on weight loss medication coverage, and these benefits vary between the company’s various health plans. For those on Tricare, the healthcare program for the uniformed services, weight loss medications may be covered in certain situations. Approval of these drugs from the Defense Health Agency hinges on a few factors, which you can learn more about below.

Does Tricare cover weight loss medication?

There are various Tricare health plans, including those for active duty members, National Guard and Reserve service members, retirees, and eligible family members of these groups. According to an August 2025 update, Tricare states that they do not generally cover weight loss medication. While this may seem like bad news, this does not mean a blanket “no” for weight loss drugs.

Tricare does not cover weight loss drugs at all for the following individuals:

TRICARE For Life beneficiaries

People with direct care coverage (military hospitals and clinics)

Certain other groups (details are not specified)

Tricare states that as of August 31, 2025, these groups will be required to pay 100% of the cost of weight loss medicine—even if a prior authorization had been previously approved.

Tricare MAY cover weight loss drugs such as Wegovy, Saxenda, or Zepbound for weight management for the following groups, as long as you use a TRICARE network provider and the drug is a medical necessity (i.e., you meet prior authorization requirements):

TRICARE Prime and Prime Remote

Uniformed Services Family Health Plan

TRICARE Select

TRICARE Young Adult

TRICARE Reserve Select

TRICARE Retired Reserve

Continued Health Care Benefit Program

Criteria for weight loss medication coverage

Since TRICARE has many different plans, coverage requirements (as well as your copay or out-of-pocket costs) may vary among plans. Your healthcare professional can work with you to navigate your insurance policy and can work on the prior authorization (PA) process. When a PA is required, the healthcare provider will need to submit information to the plan as to why a medicine is medically necessary for you. Typically, insurance plans will want to ensure that you are using the drug for an FDA-approved use, such as Zepbound for moderate to severe sleep apnea in adults with obesity. You can contact your specific plan for more information on weight loss medication coverage.

How to get approved for weight loss medication

With TRICARE’s August 2025 update, all prescription weight loss drugs will require a PA—but not all TRICARE plans cover weight loss drugs (see section above). If your plan pays for weight loss drugs with an approved PA, your healthcare provider will need to submit information to the plan explaining why the drug is medically necessary for you. They will need to submit supporting information, such as weight, body mass index (BMI), and notes from your visit.

If your healthcare provider prescribes a GLP-1 for weight loss, they must prescribe the FDA-approved version for weight loss. “The trick to approval is making sure the prescription is sent for the approved weight loss version of the medication,” said Dr. Brown, an obesity medicine specialist with MyObesityTeam. “For example, Tricare won’t pay for Ozempic if it’s prescribed for obesity, but it will pay for Wegovy.”

Ozempic and Wegovy are both injectable medications that contain semaglutide. Ozempic has been approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for managing Type 2 diabetes, and Wegovy has been FDA-approved for weight loss. That means Ozempic would not typically be covered for weight loss under TRICARE insurance, but Wegovy may be covered—if your plan includes weight loss medications and the PA is approved.

How much does weight loss medication cost without insurance?

If your TRICARE plan does not cover the cost of your weight loss medicine, you can pay out of pocket without insurance. It may also be more affordable by using a SingleCare coupon. Here are some of the costs you can expect for the most popular weight loss drugs.

Zepbound (tirzepatide) has an average retail price of $1,532 per 4, 5mg/0.5ml 0.5ml pens, but you can pay just $950 with a Zepbound coupon from SingleCare—a savings of almost $600 per month.

Wegovy (semaglutide) has an average retail price of $1,850 per 4, 0.75ml prefilled 2.4mg/0.75ml pens, but you can pay just $1,225 with a SingleCare savings card, saving you $625 each month.

Saxenda (liraglutide) has an average retail cost of $1,819 for 5, 18mg/3ml (6mg/ml) 3ml pens, but if you fill your Rx with generic liraglutide and use a free SingleCare coupon, you could pay as low as $469, saving you $1,350 per month.

How to check whether your Tricare plan covers weight loss medication

There is a Tricare formulary search tool that provides the usual cost of prescription medications. The formulary is a list of all the medications covered by an insurance plan, along with their corresponding pricing tiers. By filling out the medication form and inputting your sex and age, you’ll get details about the price and requirements for each prescription drug.

How to save on weight loss medication

The CareSource Tricare Prime Demonstration program is an alternative within the Tricare Prime framework offering comprehensive managed care through CareSource Military and Veterans. Through this program, beneficiaries will receive care through the CareSource provider network instead of the Humana Military network.

Beneficiaries who would like to use this program need to make the switch during the current Tricare open enrollment season, which runs from Nov. 10, 2025, to Dec. 9, 2025, for coverage in 2026.

What’s Different?

I chatted with Ted Painter of CareSource to learn more about how care under this demonstration project will differ from other Tricare Prime options, including US Family Health Plans. Painter is the associate vice president of market operations for CareSource Military and Veterans and a sergeant major in the Marine Corps Reserve.

Read more: Costs for Tricare Are Going Up in 2026

The primary difference is that you’ll use the CareSource network of providers instead of a military treatment facility or the Humana Military Network.

“If a beneficiary's primary care manager is currently at a military treatment facility, we will work with them to transition to a provider in our civilian network, so their care stays coordinated under this model,” Painter explained. So if you currently go to a military treatment facility, you’ll be moving care to new providers.

The CareSource project is supposed to streamline many of the frustrations with traditional Tricare. No referrals are required to see in-network specialists.

“This removes one of the biggest barriers families face when trying to get to the right provider, when and where they need them,” Painter said. Given that referrals are frequently a pain point with Tricare Prime, this may be a highly attractive benefit.

One highlighted benefit of the CareSource demonstration project is robust care management. Painter told me CareSource has “a team that helps coordinate care and follows through so issues don't stall. You also have support on demand, including telehealth, the MyLife app, nurse advice and remote monitoring. Families receive personalized help during more complex times such as pregnancy, behavioral health needs, or recovery after a hospital stay.”

While traditional Tricare has some of these features, such as telehealth, nurse advice and case management, this program may offer them in a different way.

What About Prescriptions?

Prescription drug benefits under the demonstration remain managed by Express Scripts, aligning with the existing Tricare Pharmacy program. Beneficiaries may continue to use military pharmacies and Tricare-certified retail network pharmacies for their prescriptions.

Who Is Eligible to Choose This Program?

Eligible participants include active-duty family members, activated National Guard or Reserve family members, retirees or their family members, and eligible survivors. Geographically, eligibility is based on having a ZIP code in the Atlanta, Georgia, or Tampa, Florida area.

This demonstration program does not include active-duty service members, Tricare Young Adult, or the Transitional Assistance Management Program (TAMP).

Costs and Fees

This program will cost the same as Tricare Prime, based on your service member’s status and Tricare group. However, enrollment fees paid by retirees, their families and survivors will be waived for the first year. This incentive may help reduce total out-of-pocket costs for care for those families who do not meet their annual catastrophic cap.

Most people like having choice in their health care options. This CareSource demonstration is another choice you have during this year’s Tricare open season. Understanding how this demonstration works can help you decide whether you’d like to switch your care for 2026 and beyond. As Painter pointed out, “We are not replacing other Tricare options. This simply gives families another way to use the benefit they have earned, depending on what fits their situation best.”

Veterans have become the test subjects of a field in which side effects, drug interactions and long-term effects are sometimes unknown.
The signed budget fully funds TRICARE health care coverage for Michigan’s National Guard members so their health care is covered when they are called up – even outside of federal deployments.
“Veterans have showed such incredible courage putting their lives on the line to protect our freedoms,” Thompson said.","State Rep. Jamie Thompson recently hosted VFW and other veterans’ organizations at an event in Lansing to promote needed care and awareness for issues facing those who have sacrificed for their country and fellow community members.

Thompson, who is a Licensed Practical Nurse, spoke about safe prescription practices, side effects of psychotropic medications like anti-depressants, and informed consent protections. The event provided evidence-based information about medication-related suicides and veteran suicide prevention strategies.

“I know that drugs save lives. I also know that drugs can destroy lives,” said Thompson, of Brownstown, noting that 70 percent of veterans in VA care are prescribed with psychotropic medications. “There is a fine line between care and preventable harm. Patients deserve every piece of information when being prescribed medication – the good, the bad and the ugly. That is why we call it informed consent. Patients need to have all relevant information to be properly informed.

“Unfortunately, our veterans are often prescribed medication without everything available to them in order to make an informed decision and this produces negative, heartbreaking outcomes. Veterans have become the test subjects of a field in which side effects, drug interactions and long-term effects are sometimes unknown. This was a very constructive conversation that will help veterans, their families and providers know what to look for in case intervention is needed to help improve care and save lives.”

Thompson, who serves on the House Families and Veterans Committee, recently voted for a state budget agreement that makes veterans and service members a top priority. The signed budget fully funds TRICARE health care coverage for Michigan’s National Guard members so their health care is covered when they are called up – even outside of federal deployments.

In September, she welcomed leaders from Downriver for Veterans, a local nonprofit organization that supports veterans across Downriver communities with emergency funds to assist them with rent, meals, utilities, car repairs and other essential life expenses, to Lansing for a House Families and Veterans Committee hearing. The group provided insight on the need for more detailed veteran benefit screening and registration efforts upon discharge to ensure veterans have access to care and knowledge about available resources, including housing.

“Veterans have showed such incredible courage putting their lives on the line to protect our freedoms,” Thompson said. “We owe it to them to bring awareness to these issues and fight for them.”",https://dtj5wlj7ond0z.cloudfront.net/uploads/2025/11/Paitent-Designation_Thmpsn_0625_4-scaled.jpg,N,0.0,2025-11-11 05:00:17.318329

“Ripping away the retirements we have earned is a betrayal of the sacrifices made by servicemembers and our families.
Then, in August 2025, the Air Force reneged on its promises to those Airmen and informed them that they must, instead, be separated without retirement under Secretary Hegseth’s transgender military ban.

Today, 17 transgender servicemembers who each have over 15 years of service in the United States Air Force and Space Force filed Ireland v. United States, a lawsuit against the Trump administration in the Federal Court of Claims for rescinding the retirements they earned and that were previously granted to them by the Secretary of the Air Force. Transgender servicemembers impacted by this rescission will face a loss of up to $1–2 million owed for their service over the course of their lifetime, impacting these military families’ long-term economic security. This rescission also includes loss of lifetime access to TRICARE health insurance, which would have provided access to civilian health care providers beyond VA facilities.

“I raised my hand and served my country honorably for 15 years, including a deployment to Afghanistan,” said lead plaintiff Master Sergeant Logan Ireland. “Ripping away the retirements we have earned is a betrayal of the sacrifices made by servicemembers and our families. We should not be thrown into economic hardship or made to feel our years of service are regarded by our country as meaningless.”

In June 2025, the Air Force issued retirement orders to transgender Airmen plaintiffs in this case. Then, in August 2025, the Air Force reneged on its promises to those Airmen and informed them that they must, instead, be separated without retirement under Secretary Hegseth’s transgender military ban. The lawsuit argues that the rescission of retirement orders in this case violates the Air Force’s own retirement policies and procedures, which only permit retirement rescissions under very limited circumstances, none of which are present here.

“Tomorrow is Veterans Day, yet the Trump administration continues to deepen its betrayal of veterans by ripping away the pensions and health care benefits of honorable Airmen who have deployed around the world,” said NCLR Legal Director Shannon Minter, one of the lead attorneys in this case, who is transgender and brings more than 30 years of civil rights legal experience to this litigation. “There has never been an administration that has shown such open hostility to the brave men and women who have served our country.”

Pensions are an essential part of the promise made to servicemembers due to their sacrifices and help military families avoid economic hardship. These pensions are earned and compensate servicemembers for the unique sacrifices and constraints of military life that make it difficult to save for retirement and create the diversified retirement portfolios that civilians can. For example, because of frequent job-related moves, members of our military typically cannot purchase a house and live there for 20 years to grow equity.

“This is a senseless and shocking affront to troops who have sacrificed so much for our country,” said GLAD Law Staff Attorney Michael Haley. “Each of these families faces a potential loss of up to $1–2 million over the course of their lifetimes. These brave transgender servicemembers deserve the retirement benefits they have earned and that the Air Force granted them. As a country, we must honor our word to them, not rip away their benefits.”

Military.com had the chance to interview Selene Martin, CareSource Associate Vice President, Corporate Affairs.

Kimberly O’Brien, Military.com: Please tell us about yourself. What is your background, and how has this shaped your vision for the future of healthcare for the military community?

Selene Martin, CareSource Associate Vice President, Corporate Affairs: I am the Associate Vice President of Corporate Affairs for CareSource Military & Veterans, leading strategy and stakeholder engagement for our military programs. This includes serving on the TRICARE Prime Demo’s Design and Management Team, where we listen deeply to the community and work to earn trust through clarity, connection, and care. My professional journey blends corporate impact with military family advocacy. Before joining CareSource, I directed military philanthropy at USAA, where I led initiatives in mental health, economic mobility, and veteran suicide prevention, driving impactful programs that enhanced access to essential resources for the military community. Additionally, I spent 15 years at LexisNexis focusing on social impact initiatives related to justice and equity, and have served on several national advisory councils supporting military spouses and veterans. I am also a military spouse, which means health care decisions are not just data points or spreadsheets to me. I know how complex and deeply personal they can be. I came to CareSource to be part of an effort that seeks to see families and hear their needs, support them, and ultimately empower them to make decisions that are right for their family. I envision a health care landscape where plans fully reflect the real lives of the people they serve, and I’m proud to be part of a team working to make that vision a reality.

O’Brien: What is the TRICARE Prime Demo by CareSource Military & Veterans, and how does it differ from the traditional TRICARE Prime option available to beneficiaries?

Martin: The TRICARE Prime Demo is a pilot program developed by the Department of Defense to demonstrate new ways of providing connected care to military families. CareSource Military & Veterans is bringing this reality to life in Atlanta and Tampa. The underlying TRICARE Prime benefit hasn’t changed. We’re changing the experience around it. We’re enhancing the program with military family-inspired features like a 24/7 nurse advice line, no referrals for in-network care, a portal to easily access and share important information, and care managers with lived experience in navigating care. We’re part of a nonprofit, with military in our DNA, and we’re building a health plan that feels personal, responsive and reliable for the families that depend on it every day.

O’Brien: How does CareSource Military & Veterans plan to address the unique needs of military families, retirees, and survivors in the Tampa and Atlanta metro areas?

Martin: We started by listening. Before offering coverage, we spent time learning directly from families, retirees, and base leaders in both communities. We heard a lot about the need for timely information, clearer navigation and care that adapts to family transitions. That’s why our approach is centered on community connection and proactive support. From digital tools to multilingual materials to peer support teams with lived military experience, we’ve built this plan with the realities of military life in mind, especially for those who often feel overlooked.

O’Brien: What measures are being taken to ensure timely access to providers, especially given the challenges many military families face with relocations and continuity of care?

Martin: We know that finding the right provider and maintaining consistent care are among the biggest stressors in military life. To address this, we leverage technology and strong relationships with provider networks. We’ve invested in digital tools that make it easier to search for in-network providers based on location, language, specialty, and military familiarity. We’ve also partnered with provider networks that understand the pace of military life. Whether someone is new to the area, in transition, or hasn’t used civilian care in a while, our job is to meet them with clear answers and a path forward.

O’Brien: What specific features or services set CareSource Military & Veterans apart from other TRICARE options, and why might beneficiaries consider switching?

Martin: The TRICARE benefit is the same, but your experience will be different. At CareSource Military & Veterans, we’re adding layers of support designed to make it easier for you to find information and help when you need it. We have care managers with experience in navigating both physical and behavioral health needs. Additionally, we offer tools aimed at reducing the day-to-day stress of military life. We also hear from many families who want their care experience to feel personal, not just procedural. That’s why service is our top priority. As part of a nonprofit with military roots, our entire team is dedicated to you, your health, and building trust so we can be a steady partner in your care.

O’Brien: If this demonstration project proves successful, how do you envision the program expanding or shaping the future of TRICARE coverage nationwide?

Martin: The DoD established this demo to find out if innovative solutions can improve how TRICARE works for military families. If this demonstration is successful, it will help shape the future of TRICARE for military and veteran communities around the country. Success for us at CareSource Military & Veterans is simple: Did families feel seen? Did they receive support? Did they find care when and how they needed it? Did we keep up with their pace of military life? If we can answer yes to all these questions, then we will have demonstrated that a health plan can bring both high-quality and humanity to the services it provides. That’s the kind of example we want to set, and that’s why we’re proud to have been selected for this demonstration.

O’Brien: Is there anything else you want our readers to know?

Martin: If you’re eligible and living in the Atlanta or Tampa metro areas, I encourage you to explore the new TRICARE Prime Demo option with CareSource Military & Veterans during this year’s Open Season. We understand that switching plans is a significant decision. You deserve to feel supported, informed, seen, and valued. And we’ll keep showing up to make sure that happens.

Outside of Tricare open season, beneficiaries can enroll or change their enrollment following certain life events, including marriage, the birth of a child or retirement from active duty.
Open season does not apply to active-duty service members.
Premium-based plans, including Tricare Reserve Select, Retired Reserve and Young Adult, also are not impacted by open season.
Open season for FEDVIP is Nov. 10–Dec.","Beginning Nov. 10, military retirees and eligible beneficiaries who use Tricare can enroll in or make changes to their health care coverage.

Tricare open season, which runs through Dec. 9, allows beneficiaries who use Tricare Prime, Tricare Select or the U.S. Family Health Plan to stay on their plan, enroll in a plan or change plans. Changes go into effect Jan. 1.

Beneficiaries who are satisfied with their plan don’t need to do anything—their coverage will continue automatically for 2026.

Those who are not already in a plan and don’t enroll during open season could still receive care, but they will “only be eligible for care at a military hospital or clinic if space is available,” according to the Tricare website. Outside of Tricare open season, beneficiaries can enroll or change their enrollment following certain life events, including marriage, the birth of a child or retirement from active duty.

For 2026, active-duty family members, retirees and their eligible family members In Atlanta and Tampa, Florida, also can enroll in a new Tricare Prime option. Managed by CareSource Military and Veterans, enrollees will get care from CareSource’s network of primary and specialty care providers. Part of a three-year test, the program aims to give beneficiaries an additional option while improving access to care, officials said when the program was announced in May.

Open season does not apply to active-duty service members. It also does not apply to Tricare for Life—coverage is automatic for eligible beneficiaries who have Medicare Part A and Part B, according to Tricare.

Premium-based plans, including Tricare Reserve Select, Retired Reserve and Young Adult, also are not impacted by open season. Eligible beneficiaries can buy these plans at any time throughout the year, according to Tricare.

Additionally, eligible military beneficiaries have until Dec. 8 to enroll in or make changes to their vision and/or dental coverage through the Federal Employees Dental and Vision Insurance Program. Known as FEDVIP, the program, managed by the Office of Personnel Management, offers a range of plans at varying costs, and coverage is not automatic, so beneficiaries must act to enroll in a dental or vision plan.

Open season for FEDVIP is Nov. 10–Dec. 8.

Mapping your benefits to a real plan Veterans’ finances are different because military service connects to nearly every part of a financial plan.
Health care, disability compensation, GI Bill education benefits, TRICARE, and tax-free payments all interact in ways that can either strengthen or complicate a family’s long-term goals.
For those receiving disability benefits, note that payments increased by 2.5% for 2025, reflecting the latest cost-of-living adjustment.
Before enrolling, use the VA’s GI Bill Comparison Tool to evaluate programs and ensure the school is fully accredited and transparent about costs.","Every November, Americans pause to honor the courage and sacrifice of our service members and their families.

Veterans Day is more than a date on the calendar; it’s a reminder that freedom and security come at a cost, and that those who served our nation are entitled to the same sense of safety and peace they fought to protect.

One of the most powerful ways to show appreciation is by helping our veterans make the most of the benefits they’ve earned. Today’s array of federal programs covering health care, housing, education, insurance, and retirement savings can provide a strong foundation for lifelong financial stability. But these benefits are complex and often underused. Knowing where to start can make all the difference.

Mapping your benefits to a real plan

Veterans’ finances are different because military service connects to nearly every part of a financial plan. Health care, disability compensation, GI Bill education benefits, TRICARE, and tax-free payments all interact in ways that can either strengthen or complicate a family’s long-term goals.

Begin by taking inventory. Gather your service record and note any exposure history, since the PACT Act has expanded eligibility for health care and disability compensation to many veterans who were previously excluded. Verify your disability rating and dependent status and review your education benefits under the Post-9/11 or Montgomery GI Bill programs.

Even if you are healthy, enrolling in VA health care is an important step. It keeps your record active, builds a relationship with a primary care provider, and makes future claims easier to process. Think of it as a continuation of the self-care that keeps you and your family strong.

For those receiving disability benefits, note that payments increased by 2.5% for 2025, reflecting the latest cost-of-living adjustment.

Housing: turning service into stability

Few benefits have transformed more lives than the VA home loan. For veterans with full entitlement, there are no loan limits. This presents an enormous advantage for buyers in higher-cost housing markets. The program’s funding fee can often be waived for service-connected disability, and closing timelines today can rival conventional loans when paperwork is in order.

For veterans considering a move, understanding entitlement restoration rules can help preserve eligibility for future purchases. Home ownership remains one of the most enduring ways to build wealth, and the VA loan continues to make that dream attainable for those who served.

Education and career transitions

Education has long been part of America’s promise to its veterans. The GI Bill still offers some of the most generous tuition and housing benefits available anywhere. As of Aug. 1, 2025, new academic-year rates are in effect through July 2026, with the monthly housing allowance tied to the rate for an E-5 with dependents in the school’s ZIP code.

A major change this year comes from the Supreme Court’s Rudisill v. McDonough decision, which allows many veterans who earned both the Montgomery and Post-9/11 GI Bills to use both programs for up to 48 months of combined education benefits. That is a significant win for those pursuing new careers or credentials after service.

Veterans who have completed their education have the option to transfer their education benefits to a spouse or child, creating a meaningful legacy. Before enrolling, use the VA’s GI Bill Comparison Tool to evaluate programs and ensure the school is fully accredited and transparent about costs.

Preserving income, insurance and retirement

Financial security also depends on preserving income and protecting loved ones. The VA’s VALife program, introduced in 2023, offers guaranteed-acceptance whole-life insurance coverage up to $40,000 for veterans age 80 or younger. Those currently insured under the older S-DVI program have until Dec. 31, 2025, to apply for VALife while maintaining existing coverage during the two-year transition period.

As of this fall, more than $2 billion in VALife coverage has been issued, proof that many veterans are taking advantage of this new option. Meanwhile, TRICARE premiums and dental fees for 2025 have been updated; small adjustments can add up over time, so be sure to account for those in your budget.

Service members under the Blended Retirement System should continue contributing enough to capture the 5% Thrift Savings Plan match. This effectively is free money, and one of the simplest ways to strengthen long-term security. And remember that VA disability payments are tax-free, which can affect whether a Roth or traditional account makes more sense for your retirement savings.

Five fast moves every veteran should consider

Document any toxic exposure: The PACT Act expansions mean more veterans now qualify for early care and compensation.

Time your education start: GI Bill housing allowances reset each Aug. 1, so plan enrollment around that date.

Check your Certificate of Eligibility: Full entitlement can remove loan limits under the VA program.

Review your life insurance coverage: Compare private-term policies with the new VALife program, especially before the 2025 S-DVI deadline.

Revisit your TRICARE budget: Premium and dental costs changed this year, adjust accordingly.

A message of gratitude

This Veterans Day, our gratitude extends beyond words. We thank every service member and family who has shouldered the burden of duty and wish to remind them that financial well-being is part of the peace they’ve earned.

Take this Veterans Day as a moment to review your benefits, update your plan, and ensure the security you defended continues here at home.

This seems contradictory to the shutdown guidance exempting private-sector care from the shutdown’s effects.
TRICARE also says the open season enrollment window for 2026 coverage remains on schedule despite the shutdown.
Furloughs among non-excepted Defense civilians slow everything from maintenance to program management to installation services.
The Bottom Line for Readiness From flight demonstrations to weekend drills to program awards, the shutdown is eroding predictability.","The federal government shut down at 11:59 p.m. EDT on September 30, 2025. Under the government’s official “Lapse in Appropriations” guidance, uniformed personnel stay on duty and most Defense civilians supporting “excepted” missions continue working, but normal pay is paused until Congress enacts funding. The formal Defense guidance for this shutdown reiterates that active servicemembers “may be assigned to carry out non-excepted activities in place of furloughed civilian personnel only to the extent that the non-excepted activity is capable of performance without incurring new obligations.

Paycheck Funding

Mid-month, President Trump directed the Pentagon to use “all available funds” so troops would receive pay despite the lapse. Reporting indicates the department moved to repurpose about $8 billion in unobligated R&D accounts to cover the October 15 payroll, and later acknowledged accepting a $130 million private donation to help offset military pay. Those extraordinary measures do not fully resolve uncertainty.

Training and Drill Impacts

Across the reserve component, routine training weekends are being postponed in many places. The National Guard Association of the United States advises that typical drill periods are not authorized during a shutdown unless they support excepted activities, and units are issuing state-by-state guidance.

High-visibility events are taking hits, too. The Navy’s Blue Angels skipped San Francisco Fleet Week this month because of the shutdown’s travel and funding limits. The team’s annual homecoming at NAS Pensacola was cancelled entirely, as base officials cited uncertainty around funding and logistics.

Health Care and TRICARE

Defense Health Agency operations continue in a constrained environment. TRICARE has told beneficiaries that they may keep appointments with civilian providers and that coverage remains in effect, but the agency has warned that processing and paying new medical claims for care received on or after October 1 may be delayed until funding is restored. This seems contradictory to the shutdown guidance exempting private-sector care from the shutdown’s effects. TRICARE also says the open season enrollment window for 2026 coverage remains on schedule despite the shutdown.

Commissaries, Schools, and On-Base Life

Defense Commissary Agency leaders say stores are operating normally for now and have enough working-capital funding to continue operations for at least 60 days, but have cautioned that extended lapses could force closures when funds are exhausted. Local updates from installations echo that message: commissaries remain open today, while warning that prolonged shutdowns may trigger furloughs and closures.

DoDEA schools have continued operating, but some extracurriculars and support functions are being temporarily paused or cancelled until further notice. Family-support organizations are pointing service members to relief programs and are updating installation-specific changes as they occur.

Civilians, Contractors, and the Industrial Base

The Defense Department relies on a large civilian workforce and a sprawling industrial base. Furloughs among non-excepted Defense civilians slow everything from maintenance to program management to installation services. For industry, the rule of thumb is that work on already-funded contracts continues, but new obligations cannot be made unless the work is tied to an “excepted” activity. This means option awards, new starts, and many modifications stall, with cascading schedule and cost effects that worsen the longer the shutdown runs.

Delays are not abstract. Even a short pause in program actions creates backlogs of source selections, award notices, and production ramp decisions that must all be rescheduled, often pushing milestones into a new quarter and adding cost.

The Bottom Line for Readiness

From flight demonstrations to weekend drills to program awards, the shutdown is eroding predictability. While core operations continue and combatant commands remain manned, the compound effect of delayed training, paused travel, furloughed civilians, and slow-rolling contracts is a readiness tax that grows each week. Commissaries can operate on cash reserves only so long and TRICARE can promise access while warning of delayed payments. Neither of those are durable substitute for appropriations.

What service members and families can do now is practical: confirm unit-level drill and travel guidance; keep scheduled civilian medical appointments but anticipate possible TRICARE claim delays; monitor installation and commissary updates; and, if needed, tap relief resources advertised by commands and service aid societies while Congress works toward a funding bill.

According to base officials, all non-urgent primary care needs are currently being redirected to the Tricare network, including radiology services.

The center's pharmacy operations will now be open just Monday through Wednesday. Its script center will remain accessible five days a week. Officials have also said that longer wait times are anticipated for non-urgent care, along with increased use of local urgent care centers and emergency rooms to help offset the reduction in services on base.

Specialty services, including optometry, behavioral health, physical therapy and essential force health protection, will remain operational.

U.S. Rep. Dale Strong (R-Huntsville), who represents the district that includes Redstone Arsenal, laid the blame for the operational changes on Democrats, arguing on X that the shutdown was ""completely avoidable.""
