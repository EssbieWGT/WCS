The Defense Health Agency recently published its chaperone policy across all military hospitals and clinics worldwide. You can request a chaperone for any physical exam or medical or dental visit. Your provider may also request a chaperone for these appointments.

“Having chaperones available is a crucial part of patient-centered care,” said Dr. Paul Cordts, DHA Deputy Assistant Director, Medical Affairs and Chief Medical Officer. “Chaperones can help protect both patients and health care staff.”

What do chaperones do?

Chaperones (or “standbys”) serve as an unbiased third party to any exam or clinical visit between you and your provider. They’re a safeguard for both patients and staff. They can help you and your provider feel at ease, especially during sensitive exams.

These chaperones are members of the clinical team who are discreet and protect privacy. They’ll immediately report any suspected inappropriate conduct.

You have the right to request a chaperone at any time before or during an appointment or exam. If you request a chaperone when scheduling an appointment, staff can add a note that you’ve asked for a chaperone. Staff will make a reasonable effort to provide a chaperone of the preferred sex if you or your provider request it. If a chaperone of the preferred sex is requested and not immediately available, you’ll be assisted in rescheduling at a time when one is available.

Health care staff must offer you a chaperone before performing a sensitive exam. (Note: There may be exceptions for emergency situations.) You can decline a chaperone, but health care staff may also decline to perform a sensitive exam (e.g., examination, treatment or procedure of the genitalia, rectum, or female breasts, or forensic health care examinations) in nonemergency situations if there is no chaperone present. To learn more about potentially sensitive exams, you can read the policy.

You can request a chaperone by talking to your provider or other hospital or clinic staff. You don’t have to explain why you’re making the request.

Who can serve as a chaperone?

The following staff members may serve as chaperones:

Physicians, dentists

Physician assistants, psychologists, social workers

Nurses

Medics, corpsmen

Technicians, paraprofessionals

Medical support assistants, or MSAs

Residents, students with a formal training agreement

Military hospital or clinic volunteers

Note: Sexual assault response coordinators, victim advocates, or family advocacy personnel may accompany you for health care associated with interpersonal violence. They can accompany you if you request their presence. But they can’t serve as a chaperone.

What are my other patient rights?

You may notice signs or posters in your military hospital or clinic that explain your right to a chaperone. Want to learn more about your rights? Visit TRICARE Rights and Responsibilities.

How can I get support if I have questions?

Do you have more questions about the chaperone policy? Or, do you have concerns about the care you received at a military hospital or clinic?

Patient advocates can help. They’re representatives who can help with your concerns or questions about services at a military hospital or clinic. They can:

Listen to your concerns

Address complaints about health care services you received

Explain military hospital or clinic policies

Mediate concerns between you and your provider

Faster decisions through quantum data processing Beyond cyberspace intelligence gathering, the report highlights how quantum computing could reshape command and control.
By rapidly analyzing data from many sources, quantum systems could give commanders near real-time awareness of changing battlefield conditions.","China’s military has revealed fresh details about its push to use quantum technology to extract high-value intelligence from public cyberspace, signaling a new phase in how future conflicts could be planned and fought.

The disclosure came from Science and Technology Daily, an official state newspaper, which said the People’s Liberation Army is already testing early quantum cyberwarfare tools during frontline missions.

According to the report, more than 10 experimental quantum cyber warfare tools are now “under development,” with several already being “tested in front-line missions.” The work is being led by a supercomputing laboratory at the National University of Defense Technology.

The effort brings together cloud computing, artificial intelligence, and quantum technology to build systems that can handle complex military data faster than current methods.

PLA commanders believe quantum computing could process massive volumes of battlefield information within seconds. That speed could help commanders make decisions faster and allocate resources more efficiently during high-pressure operations. An unnamed officer told the newspaper that “speed and change” were the main drivers behind the development of these new cyber weapons.

The officer added that the guiding idea was that “to design a good weapon, one must first think about the form of the next war.” This suggests the PLA sees quantum cyber capabilities as essential for conflicts where digital systems, data dominance, and rapid adaptation could decide outcomes.

Faster decisions through quantum data processing

Beyond cyberspace intelligence gathering, the report highlights how quantum computing could reshape command and control. By rapidly analyzing data from many sources, quantum systems could give commanders near real-time awareness of changing battlefield conditions. This could reduce delays between detection, decision-making, and action.

Liu Wei, a researcher at the PLA’s Information Support Force, said the team is working on “new models of battlefield awareness powered by cybersecurity.” These models aim to merge data from different domains into a clearer operational picture.

According to South China Morning Post, the article added that “[The team] fully leverages the advantages of the public service platform system’s integration and all-domain support capabilities”. This approach combines information streams that were previously handled separately, creating a more unified view for military planners.

Detecting stealth threats and secure navigation

The report also points to quantum sensing and positioning as key areas of interest. Quantum sensing technologies could improve air defense systems by detecting stealth aircraft that traditional radar might miss. This could reduce the effectiveness of low-observable platforms designed to evade detection.

Quantum positioning systems are also seen as a means to develop highly accurate navigation tools that are resistant to spoofing or jamming. In modern conflicts, disrupting satellite navigation has become a common tactic. Systems based on quantum principles could continue to function even when GPS signals are denied or manipulated.

These capabilities would not only support combat operations but also protect logistics, communications, and coordination across large areas.

Close ties between researchers and front-line troops

The newspaper said researchers from the unit have been working directly with front-line troops to better understand real operational needs. Over the course of a year, they used individual pieces of collected data to build a unified situation map that reflects conditions on the ground.

“In the future, we will continue to maintain a close partnership with the military to better serve them,” Liu said. A senior figure in a quantum computing and supercomputing unit also stressed caution, saying “we must enhance our awareness of operational needs and maintain sensitivity in the use of technology”.

The article added that since its establishment, the unit has adapted to changes in warfare, technology, and adversaries. It said the team has “promoted the dynamic tracking, results sorting and practical application of cutting-edge technologies in the field of cybersecurity and information technology,” underscoring how quantum research is being tightly linked to real-world military use.",https://cms.interestingengineering.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/IE-Photo-22.jpg,N,0.0,2026-01-15 12:56:27.976835

It felt like everyone was sick — even the medical team.
Question: As you step into the role of command senior enlisted leader, what are your priorities for the first 90 days?","Force Master Chief PatrickPaul (PaP) C. Mangaran, command senior enlisted leader of the Defense Health Agency, brings more than 25 years of exemplary U.S. Navy service and leadership to the role, as well as an historic, multigenerational legacy of military service.

A native of Pittsburg, California, Mangaran enlisted in the U.S. Navy on Sept. 29, 1997, beginning a career grounded in clinical expertise, operational leadership, and a core value of generational mentorship.

From his early service as a medical laboratory technician to his appointment as force master chief, Mangaran’s career spans shipboard assignments, deployments with U.S. Marine Corps units, and multiple command master chief tours.

Mangaran hosted a spirited conversation with the DHA news team in his former office in the U.S. Navy Bureau of Medicine and Surgery to reflect on his military career and distill his philosophy of leadership and readiness across the Military Health System.

Question: You come from a family with a rich history of service: Your father served 22 years as a hospital corpsman, and your maternal grandfather and great-grandfather served in wartime. How has that heroic legacy influenced your sense of duty and commitment to service?

Mangaran: I don’t see it as a heroic legacy. It’s just what we do; we serve this country. My father served most of his career as a lab tech and retired as a chief hospital corpsman. My maternal grandfather was an Army officer who trained Philippine guerilla fighters. My maternal great-grandfather was an Army combat medic who escaped after being captured and forced into the Bataan Death March. It’s because of them, their bravery and sacrifice, that I’m here today.

Question: Was there an experience early in your career that taught you about responsibility and leadership?

Mangaran: During my first few commands as a lab tech, I was mentored by some of the people my dad mentored. Their advice — to purposely get lost on the ship — helped me discover new spaces and understand how the ship operated while learning to think through solutions and connect dots. This set me up for success, especially when, as a senior NCO (noncommissioned officer), I found myself in charge of operations at a regimental aid station in Southern California. There were major fires in the area, and the senior chief couldn’t make it in. We had displaced families and Marines throughout the camp that needed medical care. The logistics were complex, and I worked for 72 hours straight, living on energy drinks, until I had to take a knee. Operations went on for a little over 96 hours. That was my defining moment as a chief petty officer. It took a lot of grit to press forward with so many unknowns, like building a plane while you’re flying it. I had to think outside the box and teach others to think outside their own boxes. Once it was over and I saw just how much my team had accomplished, I knew I could lead others through difficult situations. It also solidified for me that I had the ability to find solutions to whatever problems life threw at me.

Question: Looking back on your tours aboard the USS Constellation and USS Tarawa, were there any formative experiences during deployment that shaped your views on leadership and readiness?

Mangaran: Aboard the USS Constellation we got hit with a typical norovirus and had more than 100 patients come through medical. It felt like everyone was sick — even the medical team. Most of us had our own IV bags on while giving patients IVs. It was a crash course in direct patient care: The mission doesn’t change just because “Doc” is down. We have to take care of our warfighters. Period. For the rest of my deployment, I wasn’t just working in the lab. I was also conducting sick call, working on the flight deck as a leading petty officer, and taking care of the other corpsmen.

On USS Tarawa I took on a lot of collateral duty jobs. It was overwhelming and made me realize I needed to learn how to delegate. I try to be as self-sufficient as possible, but I learned that I need to rely on my team, not just myself.

Question: How is your leadership style informed by that lesson of learning how to delegate responsibility?

Mangaran: When I feel compelled to jump in, usually because I’ve seen a specific situation before and want to help, I remind myself that even if I did something a certain way in the past, it might not be the right way to do it today. Leadership is situational.

The year my now 17-year-old son was born, I was the leading chief petty officer (staff noncommissioned officer in charge) of Navy Education and Training Office for 1st Marine Division. He had some medical issues that required multiple hospital visits and hospitalizations during the first few months of his life. I had to lean on my team in order to be physically present with my son during that time. They helped facilitate the combat trauma medicine training and professional development courses we were running, as well as a train-the-trainer course for other chief petty officers on base. Technology allowed me to stay in touch with the team (this was back when we carried Blackberrys) and every course was completed successfully. It was an important lesson in trusting others to get the job done and ensuring my team felt empowered to carry on with the mission in my absence.

Question: As you step into the role of command senior enlisted leader, what are your priorities for the first 90 days?

Mangaran: Beating the drum on our purpose: keeping the warfighter in the fight, keeping our medical teams in the fight, keeping ourselves in the fight. Our deployable warfighters are our priority. We can’t focus on large-scale combat operations if we can’t get warfighters out the door. Whatever your job is, master it. No matter where you are in the organization, it takes all of us working together to meet our military medical mission. I’d also like to see us leverage technology, like AI (artificial intelligence), to increase access to care.

The 10-month program at the National Defense University is designed to create senior leaders who can navigate the complexities of global logistics.
“We educate leaders to integrate resources, economics and strategy in support of national security,” said Stacey Pilling, DLA’s faculty chair at the school.
“Sometimes, when we're working on products or on a solution to a problem, we don't fully understand the thinking of our senior leaders,” he said.
“DLA is developing senior leaders and strengthening the agency with as many forward-thinking people as possible,” Wood said.","Three current Defense Logistics Agency employees are gaining a new perspective on global logistics and leadership as students at the Dwight D. Eisenhower School for National Security and Resource Strategy.

The 10-month program at the National Defense University is designed to create senior leaders who can navigate the complexities of global logistics. Its curriculum sets it apart from other senior service colleges.

“We educate leaders to integrate resources, economics and strategy in support of national security,” said Stacey Pilling, DLA’s faculty chair at the school. “We can have all the strategy in the world, but how do we get the resourcing part of it? We’re the only war college that focuses on that.”

The focus on the industrial base and economics is a key takeaway for students.

David Wood, a DLA liaison officer for the Defense Health Agency, said he’s learning about how economics drive national security, global partnerships and domestic policies.

Beyond the curriculum, students said the program’s greatest strength lies in the range of its cohort, which includes U.S. and foreign military, civilians across the federal government, and fellows from private industry.

Marcus Miller, a DLA Logistics Operations strategy analyst, said his interest in the program was in part due to the inclusion of industry-based fellows. He said the industry attendance and input makes the experience vastly different from the other war colleges.

The mix of backgrounds is one of the most rewarding aspects of the program for Kevin Phillips, a DLA Logistics Operations strategic analyst. He described the atmosphere as exhilarating and demanding.

“It’s designed to further diversify our thought process and challenge our own assumptions in how we’ve done business in the past,” Phillips said.

For Miller, he said the program has provided insight into the thinking of senior leaders.

“Sometimes, when we're working on products or on a solution to a problem, we don't fully understand the thinking of our senior leaders,” he said. “I think this gives a baseline for emerging leaders to not only move up in the organization, but to really start understanding how the senior leaders in DLA think and operate,” Miller said.

This sentiment was echoed by Wood, who said the program is about building a stronger agency.

“DLA is developing senior leaders and strengthening the agency with as many forward-thinking people as possible,” Wood said. “It's more than just an individual going to school; it's about what we can do to provide support to the services and the warfighters as quickly and as intelligently as possible.”",https://media.defense.gov/2026/Jan/15/2003856800/1920/1080/0/260115-D-D0441-1001.JPG,N,0.0,2026-01-15 09:56:32.918450

In his new role, he acknowledges the significant challenges facing the Military Health System (MHS), particularly regarding medical readiness amid limited resources and escalating health care costs.
His immediate goal is to implement a comprehensive policy that improves access to mental health care.","A retired Navy commander has officially stepped into the role of the Defense Department’s top medical leader after being sworn in as the assistant secretary of defense for health affairs. Keith Bass, previously the director of the White House Medical Unit and a health care executive at the Department of Veterans Affairs, will oversee health policy and budgeting for the Military Health System, which serves approximately 9.5 million beneficiaries, including active-duty personnel, veterans, and their families.

In his new capacity, Bass is tasked with directing the Defense Health Agency and serving as the chief medical adviser to the secretary of defense. He expressed his commitment to creating a seamless and high-quality healthcare experience for service members and their families, both during and after their time in uniform. “From their first day of service to their last, and continuing to care for them as veterans,” he emphasized his dedication to improving the health care system.

During his confirmation hearing with the Senate Armed Services Committee, Bass outlined his top priorities, which include enhancing medical readiness and stabilizing the health care system to ensure advanced care is available both on and off the battlefield. Mental health and suicide prevention are also critical areas of focus, particularly in the context of growing concerns in recent years.

Bass has a storied career in the military, with 20 years of service that began as an enlisted sailor and culminated in his promotion to the rank of commander. His extensive experience includes roles on humanitarian missions, serving in military treatment facilities, and holding positions within the CIA and the Navy Bureau of Medicine and Surgery. Notably, he was the CIA’s first nonphysician director of the Office of Medical Services and served as the medical unit director at the White House from 2013 to 2019, overseeing medical care for the highest levels of government leadership.

Most recently, he was the medical center director for the West Texas VA Health Care System, providing care for over 24,000 veterans. In his new role, he acknowledges the significant challenges facing the Military Health System (MHS), particularly regarding medical readiness amid limited resources and escalating health care costs.

Among the pressing issues cited by Bass are ongoing medical personnel shortages and complications from the new Tricare contracts, which have led to difficulties for patients in accessing specialty care and other medical services. He intends to focus on monitoring access to care, improving referral management, and enhancing the adequacy of the Tricare provider network. Additionally, he supports the Department of Defense’s directive to reattract at least 7% of Tricare beneficiaries back to military treatment facilities for direct care by the year’s end.

Bass has committed to evaluating staffing levels across military treatment facilities and ensuring that Department of Defense policies enhance manpower requirements. In addressing long-term medical personnel shortages, he will need to judiciously allocate resources to optimize care delivery. He has highlighted the urgent need for expanded mental health resources, advocating for greater telehealth capabilities for both active-duty members and veterans. His immediate goal is to implement a comprehensive policy that improves access to mental health care.

As Bass takes on this pivotal leadership role, the focus remains on transforming the Military Health System to better serve those who have dedicated their lives to military service.",https://news.ssbcrack.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Retired-Navy-Commander-Keith-Bass-Sworn-in-as-Defense-Departments.jpg,N,0.0,2026-01-15 09:56:42.575542

The event was designed to collect feedback from clinical and frontline U.S. Navy medical providers to shape the development of traumatic brain injury detection devices as part of OPMED’s TBI Field Assessment Program. Traumatic brain injuries, caused by exposure to concussive events like roadside bombs and indirect fire, are a significant threat to frontline service members. There have been more than 505,000 traumatic brain injuries reported within the Department of War since 2000, ranging from mild to severe. Many TBIs are not accompanied by exterior signs of injury yet can have both short and long-term health effects. In TBI cases, identifying internal injuries, like intercranial hemorrhage or other non-visible brain damage, is a vital first step to ensuring injured personnel receive proper treatment across the continuum of care.

During the touchpoint, corpsmen and medical officers from across Marine Corps and Navy commands in the Eastern North Carolina region provided feedback on brain trauma assessment devices currently under development at OPMED. The TBI FAP program is managed by brain health experts belonging to OPMED’s Warfighter Readiness, Performance, and Brain Health Project Management Office and their partners with the North Carolina Center for Optimizing Military Performance.

The event, hosted at the Naval Medical Center Camp Lejeune, was designed to gather feedback on TBI assessment technology prototypes in development for use in a far-forward, operational environment. Feedback from prospective end users is a vital step in the early development of any program, according to Damien Hoffman, a product manager with WRPBH.

“Collaborating with stakeholders across the military services and from key organizations in a systematic, routine way is imperative to our team’s success,” said Hoffman. “These touchpoints allow us to gather an array of feedback from end users with varying degrees of experience and expertise, an invaluable resource as we develop products for the Warfighter.”

The U.S. Navy provides medical care and services for the Marine Corps. During the touchpoint, volunteer corpsmen and medical officers participated in prototype device demonstrations and focus groups. The event was designed to capture Service-unique needs and assess potential integration and utilization of brain trauma assessment devicesin the prehospital setting, particularly at Role 1 (battalion aid station) and Role 2 (brigade level) care facilities. Participants provided feedback about the devices’ ease of use, design features, and overall fitness for use in austere, remote environments.

“Our process is a continuum, with flexibility to evolve alongside emerging threats and meet the needs of frontline Warfighters, combatant commands, and joint staff,” Hoffman added. “Our goal is to rapidly develop a TBI assessment capability at the speed of relevance, and these touchpoints are imperative to achieving that goal.”

The WRPBH TBI assessment programs are designed to develop devices that are rugged, deployable, cost-effective, and user-friendly in the hands of medical providers as close to the point of injury as possible. TBI field assessment tools are designed to give frontline providers accurate information faster to help shape treatment decisions before, during, and after medevac post-injury, according to U.S. Army Capt. Matthew D'Alessandro, an assistant product manager and research psychologist with WRPBH.

“With the evolving nature of conflict, it is our mission to keep pace technologically to enable Warfighter lethality as they prepare for future operations in places like the Indo-Pacific,” said D'Alessandro. “What that means in principle for our team is that we use a multi-avenue approach to finding solutions that fill current and future capability gaps for brain health treatment at and near the front lines.

“With TBI FAP, we have identified a capability gap – in this case, the lack of a near instantaneous brain injury assessment capability – and are working to identify candidate technologies that are commercially available or nearing wide availability. This strategic approach prepares us to meet the needs of combatant commands more rapidly than previous development models.”

During future conflicts, with logistics and evacuation capabilities limited by distance and austerity found in regions like the Arctic and Indo-Pacific, the “Golden Hour” may not be a feasible amount of time to move injured and wounded to higher care facilities. To answer the TBI treatment challenges presented by possible future conflicts in remote locations, the OPMED team works to develop new capabilities and improve tested treatments to meet the needs of tomorrow’s Warfighters, said D'Alessandro.

“Assessing the presence of brain traumas to indicate their severity without needing to move a patient to a higher care facility gives commanders on the ground more options to mitigate the challenges of distance and time,” he said. “Future conflicts will present novel challenges for combatant commanders and troops on the ground, and programs like TBI FAP will help mitigate those challenges to help keep our soldiers, sailors, airmen and Marines healthy and in the fight.”

Responses were drawn from adult patients discharged from general acute care hospitals in the previous 30 days.
A ready medical force supports a ready fighting force,” Cordts said.
Care reattraction to keep patients in the Military Health System is ""about trust and getting patients to choose military hospitals when they can,"" Cordts explained.
He noted an external, nationally recognized benchmark can influence where beneficiaries choose care: ""A five-star rating signals quality, builds confidence, and can help reattract patients to military hospitals when they have options in civilian networks.""","Fifteen Defense Health Agency facilities earned top marks from the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services for how well they prepare patients to leave the hospital, according to an analysis by Becker’s Hospital Review.

The report identified 15 military hospitals and clinics that received a five-star rating for “Care Transitions” from CMS. The rating reflects how patients judged their discharge planning and follow-up instructions after an inpatient stay — a critical time in the patient care journey, said Dr. Paul Cordts, DHA deputy assistant director, medical affairs.

“A five-star CMS rating in care transitions shows our teams exceed national benchmarks during one of the most risk-prone moments in care,” he said, noting that strong care coordination, teamwork, and patient-centered discharge planning led to the CMS recognition.

CMS listed hospital and clinic ratings based on the Hospital Consumer Assessment of Healthcare Providers and Systems survey, asking patients about their experience during a recent inpatient hospital stay. Responses were drawn from adult patients discharged from general acute care hospitals in the previous 30 days. The survey was completed between October 2023 and September 2024, and data was updated July 16, 2025.

Awarded military hospitals and clinics

The DHA military hospitals and clinics that received a five-star rating from CMS included:

60th Medical Group, Travis Air Force Base, California

96th Medical Group, Eglin Air Force Base, Florida

81st Medical Group, Keesler Air Force Base, Biloxi, Mississippi

88th Medical Group, Wright-Patterson Air Force Base, Ohio

99th Medical Group, Nellis Air Force Base, Nevada

Evans Army Community Hospital, Fort Carson, Colorado

Eisenhower Army Medical Center, Fort Gordon, Georgia

Martin Army Community Hospital, Fort Moore, Georgia

Womack Army Medical Center, Fort Liberty, North Carolina

William Beaumont Army Medical Center, Fort Bliss, Texas

Madigan Army Medical Center, Joint Base Lewis-McChord, Washington

Alexander T. Augusta Military Medical Center, Fort Belvoir, Virginia

Walter Reed National Military Medical Center, Bethesda, Maryland

Cordts said the recognition demonstrates the agency’s commitment to operational readiness: “By taking superior care of the patient, the DHA also takes care of the warfighter.”

Measuring patient experience

CMS scored hospitals and clinics through a survey asking patients to rate their health care experience through three key components:

During this hospital stay, staff took my preferences and those of my family or caregiver into account in deciding what my health care needs would be when I left.

When I left the hospital, I clearly understood the purpose for taking each of my medications.

Dr. Kristen Atterbury, DHA chief nursing officer, said those questions showed patients understood what to do after hospitalization — such as how to manage recovery, take medications correctly, and follow instructions — that can reduce complications and avoidable readmissions. “When we do those three things well, we empower patients, improve safety, and build trust,” she said.

Sharing decision-making, clearly communicating responsibilities, and thorough medication education are “cornerstones of a safe and positive patient experience,” while helping relieve the burden of recovering from injury and illness, Atterbury said. “A stressed and distracted service member is not a ready one.”

Aligning with DHA lines of effort

Cordts and Atterbury said the recognition correlates directly with DHA’s priorities of combat support, care reattraction, and enterprise services optimization.

Combat support “helps the force stay ready. A ready medical force supports a ready fighting force,” Cordts said.

Care reattraction to keep patients in the Military Health System is ""about trust and getting patients to choose military hospitals when they can,"" Cordts explained. He noted an external, nationally recognized benchmark can influence where beneficiaries choose care: ""A five-star rating signals quality, builds confidence, and can help reattract patients to military hospitals when they have options in civilian networks.""

Enterprise services optimization “uses what works and spreading it across the whole system,” Atterbury said. “The goal is to take strong steps — such as good discharge checklists and follow-up calls — and use them everywhere. This creates a standardized playbook for excellence, optimizing performance, reducing unwanted variation, and elevating the quality of care across the entire enterprise.”

The award gives DHA the opportunity to share best practices across the MHS, using patient feedback to refine discharge planning, medication counseling, and follow-up coordination — equipping warfighters to stay healthy while continuing recovery at home. This phase of the patient care journey can be vital to stay ready, said Atterbury. “A stable, and well-supported family at home enables a focused, mission-ready force in the field.”

Ultimately, the high marks received from CMS demonstrate DHA’s commitment to mission readiness, said Cordts.

“Excelling at care transitions is a strategic linchpin for the DHA,” he said. “It simultaneously enhances warfighter readiness by ensuring family well-being, attracts patients back to the direct care system, and provides a blueprint for system-wide improvement that is central to enterprise optimization.”",https://dha.mil/-/media/Project/Images/News-Images/9124347.jpg,N,1.0,2026-01-15 07:56:55.341104

What you should know

Results appear quickly. The system releases information right away. You might see your results before your provider does. Your provider will reach out about anything that requires immediate attention. If you have any questions about your results, contact your provider.

Take time to review. Read your results carefully. The patient portal may include explanations for certain values or findings. Reach out to your provider or care team if something confuses you or seems unexpected.

Some results may be sensitive. You might view emotionally difficult results before speaking with your provider. Your provider or care team can walk you through what the findings mean and discuss next steps.

You can choose when to view your results. Do you want to discuss results with your provider first? You can wait to open them in the patient portal until your provider contacts you or until your next visit.

Why this change matters

Federal law requires health systems to give patients real-time access to their electronic health information. This change improves transparency. It enables faster, more informed conversations about your care. You gain more control over your health information.

Tooth decay is still one of the most common health problems worldwide, especially in children and teenagers. According to the World Health Organization, around 60–90% of school-aged children globally experience dental cavities. In the UK, NHS data shows that tooth decay remains the leading cause of hospital admissions for children aged 6–10.

The problem usually begins in the back teeth.

Molars and premolars have deep grooves on their chewing surfaces. These grooves trap food and bacteria. Even with regular brushing, it is difficult for toothbrush bristles to reach these narrow areas. Over time, plaque builds up, acids form, and enamel starts breaking down.

Parents often believe that brushing twice a day is enough. Many adults assume they are doing everything right. But cavities do not always cause pain at the start. By the time discomfort appears, damage has already occurred.

This is where most decay quietly begins—out of sight and untreated.

Impact: Untreated Grooves Turn Into Costly Dental Problems

When food and bacteria stay trapped in tooth grooves, decay progresses faster than expected. Studies show that the chewing surfaces of molars account for nearly 80% of cavities in children, even though these surfaces represent a much smaller portion of the tooth.

Once decay starts, treatment becomes unavoidable.

A small cavity can turn into a filling. A deeper cavity may need root canal treatment. In severe cases, extraction becomes the only option. For children, this can mean missed school days, dental anxiety, and hospital visits under general anaesthesia. For adults, it often means higher treatment costs and long-term oral health issues.

The financial impact is also significant. NHS reports indicate that treating preventable tooth decay costs the UK healthcare system hundreds of millions of pounds every year. Most of these cases could have been avoided with early preventive care.

The frustrating part?

Tooth decay in grooves is largely preventable. Yet many people are never told about simple preventive options that could protect their teeth for years.

Solution: Dental Sealants Offer Proven Protection

Dental sealants are thin protective coatings applied to the chewing surfaces of back teeth. They work by sealing deep grooves and pits where food and bacteria usually collect. Once sealed, these areas become smooth and easier to clean.

The process is quick, painless, and non-invasive.

No drilling is involved. No tooth structure is removed. The tooth is cleaned, dried, and the sealant material is painted onto the surface. A special light hardens the material within seconds. The entire procedure usually takes just a few minutes per tooth.

What Does the Evidence Say?

Dental sealants are not a new concept. They have been studied for decades, and the results are consistent.

A Cochrane Review, one of the most trusted sources for healthcare evidence, found that sealants reduce the risk of decay in molars by up to 80% in the first two years after application. Even after four years, sealed teeth showed significantly fewer cavities compared to unsealed teeth.

Another long-term study published in the Journal of Dental Research followed children with sealed molars over nine years. The study reported that sealed teeth had 65% fewer cavities than unsealed teeth, even when regular brushing habits were similar.

These findings confirm one thing: sealants work.

Who Should Consider Dental Sealants?

Dental sealants are most commonly recommended for children and teenagers, but they are not limited to younger age groups.

Children and Teenagers

Permanent molars usually erupt between the ages of 6 and 12. This is when teeth are most vulnerable. Applying sealants soon after eruption offers maximum protection during high-risk years.

Public Health England supports sealant use as part of preventive dental care for children, especially those at higher risk of decay.

Adults

Adults with deep grooves, early signs of enamel wear, or a history of cavities can also benefit. Sealants can be applied to adult teeth as long as there is no existing decay.

Patients with High Decay Risk

People with dry mouth, orthodontic appliances, or difficulty maintaining oral hygiene may benefit more from sealants than brushing alone.

How Long Do Dental Sealants Last?

Dental sealants are durable but not permanent.

Most sealants last 5 to 10 years, depending on biting forces, oral habits, and regular dental check-ups. Dentists routinely check sealants during examinations and can repair or replace them if needed.

Even partially retained sealants still offer protection, as long as some coverage remains in the grooves.

The cost of maintaining sealants is far lower than treating cavities later.

Are Dental Sealants Safe?

Yes. Dental sealants have been widely used and studied for over 40 years.

Concerns have occasionally been raised about trace BPA exposure. However, multiple studies, including reviews by the American Dental Association and Public Health England, confirm that exposure from sealants is extremely low and well below safety limits.

The preventive benefits clearly outweigh any minimal risk.

Dental Sealants vs Fillings: Prevention Beats Repair

A filling repairs damage after decay has occurred. A sealant prevents that damage from happening in the first place.

Once a tooth is filled, it will always require maintenance. Fillings can wear out, crack, or need replacement. Each replacement removes more natural tooth structure.

Sealants protect the original tooth surface and delay or eliminate the need for future treatment.

From a long-term perspective, prevention always wins.

Dental Sealants and TRICARE: Common Questions from Military Families

Preventive treatments like dental sealants are especially valuable for families who want to avoid unexpected dental problems and treatment delays. For patients covered under TRICARE, a few practical questions often come up before booking an appointment.

Do you accept TRICARE?

Yes. We welcome TRICARE patients and US military families.

The Thatch Dental Practice is an official TRICARE Overseas Preferred Provider in the UK, working closely with United Concordia to support eligible patients.

Will TRICARE cover all of my treatment?

TRICARE coverage depends on your individual plan and the type of treatment required. Before starting any treatment, we clearly explain your options and discuss expected costs so you can make an informed decision.

For treatments that are covered, claims are submitted directly to TRICARE/United Concordia. In most cases, you do not need to pay us directly.

Can you help with paperwork and claims?

Yes. Our experienced team manages the administrative process for you. We submit claims on your behalf and provide any required clinical notes or documentation, so you do not need to handle paperwork yourself.

I have toothache — can I be seen urgently?

Yes. If you are experiencing pain or discomfort, please contact us and we will do our best to offer the earliest appropriate appointment.

You can email patient.coordinator@thethatchdental.co.uk or use the chatbot on our website for quick assistance.

Do you see children and families?

Yes. We provide dental care for both adults and children. This includes routine check-ups, preventive care such as dental sealants, and ongoing oral health support for the whole family.

I’m new to the UK — will the process be complicated?

Not at all. We regularly support patients who are new to the UK or newly posted to the area. Our team guides you step by step and helps ensure smooth and timely access to dental care.

Final Thoughts: Small Step, Big Impact

Dental sealants are one of the most effective preventive tools in modern dentistry. They are quick to apply, affordable, and backed by strong scientific evidence.

Yet many people still miss out on this protection simply because they are unaware of it.

If cavities keep appearing despite good brushing habits, or if a child is getting permanent teeth, sealants should be part of the conversation. Preventive care today can save years of treatment later.

Question: As you step into the role of command senior enlisted leader, what are your priorities for the first 90 days?","Force Master Chief PatrickPaul (PaP) C. Mangaran, command senior enlisted leader of the Defense Health Agency, brings more than 25 years of exemplary U.S. Navy service and leadership to the role, as well as an historic, multigenerational legacy of military service.

A native of Pittsburg, California, Mangaran enlisted in the U.S. Navy on Sept. 29, 1997, beginning a career grounded in clinical expertise, operational leadership, and a core value of generational mentorship.

From his early service as a medical laboratory technician to his appointment as force master chief, Mangaran’s career spans shipboard assignments, deployments with U.S. Marine Corps units, and multiple command master chief tours.

Mangaran hosted a spirited conversation with the DHA news team in his former office in the U.S. Navy Bureau of Medicine and Surgery to reflect on his military career and distill his philosophy of leadership and readiness across the Military Health System.

Question: You come from a family with a rich history of service: Your father served 22 years as a hospital corpsman, and your maternal grandfather and great-grandfather served in wartime. How has that heroic legacy influenced your sense of duty and commitment to service?

Mangaran: I don’t see it as a heroic legacy. It’s just what we do; we serve this country. My father served most of his career as a lab tech and retired as a chief hospital corpsman. My maternal grandfather was an Army officer who trained Philippine guerilla fighters. My maternal great-grandfather was an Army combat medic who escaped after being captured and forced into the Bataan Death March. It’s because of them, their bravery and sacrifice, that I’m here today.

Question: Was there an experience early in your career that taught you about responsibility and leadership?

Mangaran: During my first few commands as a lab tech, I was mentored by some of the people my dad mentored. Their advice — to purposely get lost on the ship — helped me discover new spaces and understand how the ship operated while learning to think through solutions and connect dots. This set me up for success, especially when, as a senior NCO (noncommissioned officer), I found myself in charge of operations at a regimental aid station in Southern California. There were major fires in the area, and the senior chief couldn’t make it in. We had displaced families and Marines throughout the camp that needed medical care. The logistics were complex, and I worked for 72 hours straight, living on energy drinks, until I had to take a knee. Operations went on for a little over 96 hours. That was my defining moment as a chief petty officer. It took a lot of grit to press forward with so many unknowns, like building a plane while you’re flying it. I had to think outside the box and teach others to think outside their own boxes. Once it was over and I saw just how much my team had accomplished, I knew I could lead others through difficult situations. It also solidified for me that I had the ability to find solutions to whatever problems life threw at me.

Question: Looking back on your tours aboard the USS Constellation and USS Tarawa, were there any formative experiences during deployment that shaped your views on leadership and readiness?

Mangaran: Aboard the USS Constellation we got hit with a typical norovirus and had more than 100 patients come through medical. It felt like everyone was sick — even the medical team. Most of us had our own IV bags on while giving patients IVs. It was a crash course in direct patient care: The mission doesn’t change just because “Doc” is down. We have to take care of our warfighters. Period. For the rest of my deployment, I wasn’t just working in the lab. I was also conducting sick call, working on the flight deck as a leading petty officer, and taking care of the other corpsmen.

On USS Tarawa I took on a lot of collateral duty jobs. It was overwhelming and made me realize I needed to learn how to delegate. I try to be as self-sufficient as possible, but I learned that I need to rely on my team, not just myself.

Question: How is your leadership style informed by that lesson of learning how to delegate responsibility?

Mangaran: When I feel compelled to jump in, usually because I’ve seen a specific situation before and want to help, I remind myself that even if I did something a certain way in the past, it might not be the right way to do it today. Leadership is situational.

The year my now 17-year-old son was born, I was the leading chief petty officer (staff noncommissioned officer in charge) of Navy Education and Training Office for 1st Marine Division. He had some medical issues that required multiple hospital visits and hospitalizations during the first few months of his life. I had to lean on my team in order to be physically present with my son during that time. They helped facilitate the combat trauma medicine training and professional development courses we were running, as well as a train-the-trainer course for other chief petty officers on base. Technology allowed me to stay in touch with the team (this was back when we carried Blackberrys) and every course was completed successfully. It was an important lesson in trusting others to get the job done and ensuring my team felt empowered to carry on with the mission in my absence.

Question: As you step into the role of command senior enlisted leader, what are your priorities for the first 90 days?

Mangaran: Beating the drum on our purpose: keeping the warfighter in the fight, keeping our medical teams in the fight, keeping ourselves in the fight. Our deployable warfighters are our priority. We can’t focus on large-scale combat operations if we can’t get warfighters out the door. Whatever your job is, master it. No matter where you are in the organization, it takes all of us working together to meet our military medical mission. I’d also like to see us leverage technology, like AI (artificial intelligence), to increase access to care.

“BAMC is again honored to be recognized by receiving an ‘A’ in the Leapfrog Hospital Safety Grade assessment,” said Dr. Evan Renz, BAMC deputy to the commander for quality and safety. “This recognition represents not only a commitment on the part of BAMC, but a larger commitment made by the Defense Health Agency to make patient safety the top priority for all of our patients. Working to achieve Leapfrog standards aligns with our overall commitment to Ready Reliable Care.

The Leapfrog Hospital Safety Grade program allows all participating hospitals to benchmark their safety efforts on a national level.Updated twice per year, the grades evaluate 22 evidence-based measures of patient safety and make it easier for patients to understand the safety standards of their local health care facilities.

In the Fall 2025 ratings, 32% of participating hospitals nationwide received the highest grade. Of the eligible military hospitals participating in the grading assessment, 90% received an ""A""grade.

“Earning the top grade among America’s participating hospitals is truly a team effort; this recognition is not earned by a small number of leaders, but truly the entire organization,” said BAMC Commander U.S. Army Col. Kevin Kelly. “Considering that the grade includes 22 evidence-based measures, there are many processes that must be monitored by many people and adhered to by many more to achieve this top grade.”

Even something as simple as proper hand washing can make a significant impact on preventing infection.

“We know from strong data that compliance with the seemingly simple task of handwashing makes a huge difference in infection prevention,” explained Bryan Abejuela, BAMC infection and prevention control specialist.“Our Infection Prevention and Control team works tirelessly to engage with and support thousands of staff members in adhering to great handwashing practices.We have observed our rates of serious infections remain near zero on most units and remain at zero for some. These results and the efforts to achieve them are recognized and acknowledged by leaders at all levels.”

“These ratings underscore the strength of our integrated military health system and the unwavering commitment of our teams to safe, high-quality care,” said Maj. Gen. Jeannine Ryder, DHA’s acting Assistant Director for Health Care Administration. “When our hospitals perform at this level, it reinforces trust — trust from our patients, our families, and the service members who rely on us to sustain readiness at home and abroad. This achievement reflects disciplined processes and a continuous focus on improvement across every military treatment facility.”

BAMC is the only Level I Trauma Center in the Department of War. It serves San Antonio and the surrounding region, caring for more than 6,000 military and civilian trauma patients each year, including 750 burn patients, from an area that stretches across 22 counties in Southwest Texas encompassing more than 2.8 million people.

About 85 percent of BAMC’s trauma admissions are community members without military affiliation. BAMC can accept civilian trauma patients for care through the Secretary of the Army Designee Program and related special authorities.

“BAMC is committed to transparency and ensuring the highest possible quality of care throughout our medical center,” said U.S. Army Col. Luis Rohena, BAMC chief medical officer. “As the largest and most robust medical treatment facility within the military healthcare system we have a special responsibility to ensure that the quality of care remains at the highest levels regardless of complexity or volume of care: each and every patient encounter is important.”

Unequal standards of care based on age move military healthcare backward.
This is the moment to ensure retiree healthcare is not treated as a legacy system scheduled for decommissioning.","A recent TRICARE policy change has ended coverage of certain weight-loss drugs for Medicare-eligible military retirees.

This policy sets a precedent that could allow for future denials of other expensive treatments for retirees.

The author calls for action as the 2027 defense budget is being drafted to protect retiree healthcare promises.

In the mid-1990s, I stood on test ranges with the ARDEC research and development team, documenting the birth of the Modular Artillery Charge System. Our job was simple in concept but critical in practice: eliminate unreliable systems, reduce risk and make sure soldiers had what they needed when it mattered most.

Later, producing Army training media at MANSCEN and supporting readiness operations for the 82nd Airborne Division, my mission remained the same — turn complexity into clarity so warfighters could execute without administrative friction.

Today, as a military retiree, I see that same dangerous friction creeping into our healthcare system.

The TRICARE victory we thought was final was only a truce.

Many of us believed the battle for retiree healthcare was settled in 2001 with the creation of TRICARE For Life. But as we enter 2026, new battle lines have quietly been drawn.

When budgets tighten, the Department of Defense has historically looked inward for savings. In the late 1980s, base medical facilities were closed. In the 1990s, retirees over age 65 were excluded from TRICARE. It took a Medal of Honor recipient — Colonel Bud Day — and a federal lawsuit to restore the promise of healthcare for life.

We believed that victory was final.

It turns out it was only a truce.

On August 31, 2025, the Defense Health Agency implemented what TRICARE described as “regulatory controls,” ending coverage of GLP-1 medications for TRICARE For Life beneficiaries when prescribed for obesity. At the same time, retirees enrolled in TRICARE Prime or Select retained a pathway to coverage.

The result is a two-tiered system — one standard of care for working-age retirees, another for Medicare-eligible retirees. Not based on medical judgment. Based on plan classification tied to age.

We are potentially moving military healthcare backward.

Some may say this concerns only one class of medication. But anyone who has worked in testing, doctrine or acquisition knows that small skirmishes are often proof-of-concept for larger operations. Once a precedent exists to deny a medically recognized treatment to one retiree population, the mechanism is in place to repeat it.

If this stands, what happens when the next breakthrough treatment for cardiac disease, diabetes or cancer carries a high price tag? Who decides which retirees qualify?

The Defense Health Agency explains this decision as statutory alignment. But statutes creating TRICARE For Life were written to protect retiree benefits — not to serve as tools to carve them away.

Unequal standards of care based on age move military healthcare backward. They erode trust in the system and signal to those still serving that promised benefits can be redefined later.

'For life' was a promise.

In Army training and system development, we never accepted a design that failed the end user. We demanded correction before fielding. We should demand no less now.

The first drafts of the 2027 Defense Budget are being written today. This is the moment to ensure retiree healthcare is not treated as a legacy system scheduled for decommissioning.

“For Life” was a promise.

Promises to those who serve should not expire.

Of the eligible military hospitals participating in the grading assessment, 90% received an ""A""grade.
BAMC can accept civilian trauma patients for care through the Secretary of the Army Designee Program and related special authorities.
“BAMC is committed to transparency and ensuring the highest possible quality of care throughout our medical center,” said U.S. Army Col. Luis Rohena, BAMC chief medical officer.","JOINT BASE SAN ANTONIO-FORT SAM HOUSTON, Texas – Brooke Army Medical Center received an “A” Leapfrog Hospital Safety Grade for Fall 2025, demonstrating a commitment to continuous improvement in providing high-quality care to its patients.

“BAMC is again honored to be recognized by receiving an ‘A’ in the Leapfrog Hospital Safety Grade assessment,” said Dr. Evan Renz, BAMC deputy to the commander for quality and safety. “This recognition represents not only a commitment on the part of BAMC, but a larger commitment made by the Defense Health Agency to make patient safety the top priority for all of our patients. Working to achieve Leapfrog standards aligns with our overall commitment to Ready Reliable Care.

The Leapfrog Hospital Safety Grade program allows all participating hospitals to benchmark their safety efforts on a national level.Updated twice per year, the grades evaluate 22 evidence-based measures of patient safety and make it easier for patients to understand the safety standards of their local health care facilities. In the Fall 2025 ratings, 32% of participating hospitals nationwide received the highest grade. Of the eligible military hospitals participating in the grading assessment, 90% received an ""A""grade.

“Earning the top grade among America’s participating hospitals is truly a team effort; this recognition is not earned by a small number of leaders, but truly the entire organization,” said BAMC Commander U.S. Army Col. Kevin Kelly. “Considering that the grade includes 22 evidence-based measures, there are many processes that must be monitored by many people and adhered to by many more to achieve this top grade.”

Even something as simple as proper hand washing can make a significant impact on preventing infection. “We know from strong data that compliance with the seemingly simple task of handwashing makes a huge difference in infection prevention,” explained Bryan Abejuela, BAMC infection and prevention control specialist.“Our Infection Prevention and Control team works tirelessly to engage with and support thousands of staff members in adhering to great handwashing practices.We have observed our rates of serious infections remain near zero on most units and remain at zero for some. These results and the efforts to achieve them are recognized and acknowledged by leaders at all levels.”

“These ratings underscore the strength of our integrated military health system and the unwavering commitment of our teams to safe, high-quality care,” said Maj. Gen. Jeannine Ryder, DHA’s acting Assistant Director for Health Care Administration. “When our hospitals perform at this level, it reinforces trust — trust from our patients, our families, and the service members who rely on us to sustain readiness at home and abroad. This achievement reflects disciplined processes and a continuous focus on improvement across every military treatment facility.”

BAMC is the only Level I Trauma Center in the Department of War. It serves San Antonio and the surrounding region, caring for more than 6,000 military and civilian trauma patients each year, including 750 burn patients, from an area that stretches across 22 counties in Southwest Texas encompassing more than 2.8 million people.

About 85 percent of BAMC’s trauma admissions are community members without military affiliation. BAMC can accept civilian trauma patients for care through the Secretary of the Army Designee Program and related special authorities.

“BAMC is committed to transparency and ensuring the highest possible quality of care throughout our medical center,” said U.S. Army Col. Luis Rohena, BAMC chief medical officer. “As the largest and most robust medical treatment facility within the military healthcare system we have a special responsibility to ensure that the quality of care remains at the highest levels regardless of complexity or volume of care: each and every patient encounter is important.”

The defendant took issue with the jury’s finding that he lacked intent for his conspiracy charge but not the substantive Anti-Kickback charges.

The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit affirmed the conviction of the co-owner of a pharmacy for violations of the Anti-Kickback Statute, finding that the government presented sufficient evidence at trial to show the defendant knew his conduct was unlawful. The court also upheld the defendant’s sentencing, finding no clear error in the district court’s application of the sentencing guidelines (U.S. v. Copeland, No. 23-13888 (11th Cir. Jan. 9, 2026)).

Scheme. The defendant was a co-owner of a pharmacy specializing in expensive compounded prescription pain and scar creams, Florida Pharmacy Solutions, Inc. (FPS). FPS produced the creams and marketed them to beneficiaries of TRICARE, which would reimburse FPS. In May 2020, the defendant was charged with one count of conspiring to defraud the U.S. and to receive and pay health care kickbacks; two counts of receiving health care kickbacks; and three counts of paying health care kickbacks. The indictment alleged that the defendant and others associated with FPS would, using direct and indirect payments of bribes and kickbacks, solicit medical providers to prescribe FPS’s creams to TRICARE beneficiaries. TRICARE would pay for the prescriptions, and FPS would pay kickbacks to the defendant and others.

Appeal. The defendant presented four arguments on appeal: (1) the evidence was insufficient to support his convictions on the five substantive counts, as he was acquitted of the conspiracy count, which demonstrates an inconsistency in the jury’s verdicts; (2) the district court erred in finding the defendant qualified for an aggravating role enhancement; (3) the district court erred in finding that the defendant was not entitled to a reduction in his offense level because he was not a zero-point offender; and (4) the district court erred in finding the defendant was not entitled to a reduction in his offense level because he did not clearly demonstrate acceptance of responsibility over his offenses. The Eleventh Circuit disagreed with the defendant on each issue and affirmed his convictions and the sentence.

Five substantive counts. The defendant argued that, because the jury found he did not have specific intent to support the conspiracy count, it follows that he did not have the requisite mens rea to support the jury’s verdicts as to the five substantive counts. To establish eligibility for plain-error relief, the defendant must satisfy three threshold requirements: (1) he must establish there was an error; (2) he must establish that the error was plain; and (3) the defendant must show a reasonable probability that, but for the error, the outcome of the proceeding would have been different. If the first three requirements are satisfied, a court may exercise its discretion to notice a forfeited error, but only if the error seriously affected the fairness, integrity, or public reputation of judicial proceedings. The defendant has the burden to establish all four requirements; satisfying all four prongs of the plain-error test is difficult, the court noted.

The Eleventh Circuit found the defendant had not carried the burden of establishing that there was a manifest miscarriage of justice. He argued that the government must prove he knew his conduct specifically violated the Anti-Kickback statute. However, the government presented sufficient evidence at trial to show the defendant knew his conduct was unlawful. Notably, the defendant’s contract with FPS required him to comply with applicable laws, including the Anti-Kickback Statute. He participated in and passed two compliance training courses. The government further showed that the defendant specifically knew about and authorized various events in which medical providers were induced with various benefits to prescribe FPS’s compounded cream prescriptions for TRICARE beneficiaries. Thus, the Eleventh Circuit found the defendant had not carried his burden of establishing that the jury’s verdict as to the five substantive counts was not supported by sufficient evidence.

Sentencing. The Eleventh Circuit upheld the district court’s sentencing analysis, finding no clear error in its application of the sentencing guidelines. The court concluded that the defendant qualified for a three-level aggravating role enhancement because he was a co-owner of the pharmacy and supervised a sales team and because the scheme involved five or more participants or was otherwise extensive. This enhancement also disqualified him from receiving a reduction as a zero-point offender. Additionally, the court affirmed the denial of a two-level reduction for acceptance of responsibility, noting that the defendant went to trial and contested his guilt, which generally precludes such an adjustment. Overall, the district court properly calculated the offense level and imposed a below-guidelines sentence of 51 months’ imprisonment.

The case is No. 23-13888.

Judge: Per curiam.

Attorneys: Brendan B. Gants, U.S. Department of Justice, for the U.S. David Elbert Little (Brown Doherty Little) for David Byron Copeland.

The new bill would create just four duty categories, according to Cisneros’ bill explainer: Contingency duty.

The Duty Status Reform Act (H.R. 6976), introduced Jan. 8, would reduce duty statuses from 30 to just four.

“This legislation simplifies the Pentagon's access to the reserve forces helping maintain mission readiness and enhancing force posture,” said Jimmy Santos, MOAA’s director of government relations for currently serving affairs. “For servicemembers in the Guard and Reserve, it guarantees equal delivery of benefits to include health care and the housing allowance.”

[TAKE ACTION: Ask Your Lawmakers to Support Duty Status Reform]

Reps. Jack Bergman (R.-Mich.) and Gil Cisneros (D-Calif.), announced the bill in a Jan. 8 press conference outside the U.S. Capitol. The bill is cosponsored by Reps. Sam Graves (R-Mo.) and Ted Lieu (D-Calif.). In addition to MOAA, the bill has the support of the National Guard Association of the United States, Reserve Organization of America, and Enlisted Association of the National Guard of the United States.

MOAA has advocated for years that the confusing and numerous duty classifications has negatively impacted servicemembers’ abilities to count time for benefits like the Post-9/11 GI Bill and for family access to military health care.

The new bill would create just four duty categories, according to Cisneros’ bill explainer:

Contingency duty. Active service in which the member is involved in contingency operations such as military action or operations; responding to a national emergency or natural disaster; or similar missions. This covers post-deployment activities.

Training and support: Active service that does not involve a contingency operation. This may include required training, administrative assignments, support to reserve units, and members reported missing.

Reserve component: Partial-day duty dedicated to readiness training and support to prepare individuals and units to be ready for future use and mobilization. Includes training periods, flight training, administrative activities, and support activities such as funeral honors support.

Remote assignments: Online learning and individually assigned duties that are completed virtually.

“We owe it to our servicemembers to deliver this much-needed change and ensure they are receiving equitable pay and benefits,” said Cisneros, a Navy veteran and former undersecretary of defense for personnel and readiness.

Bergman, a retired Marine Corps lieutenant general, said the bill would improve readiness and reduce bureaucracy.

The president signed the MOAA-backed Fairness for Servicemembers and Their Families Act into law Dec. 12. The bipartisan legislation passed the House by a voice vote in the spring, then cleared the Senate by unanimous consent in November.

“Bipartisan, commonsense improvements to trusted programs like this make a real difference,” said Jen Goodale, MOAA’s director of Government Relations for veteran and retired affairs. “Protecting the value of these benefits is the core of MOAA advocacy — we thank the lawmakers from both sides of the aisle who made this change possible.""

“Our servicemembers put their lives on the line for their country, and we must protect the well-being of their families in the event of a tragedy,” said Rep. Marylin Strickland (D-Wash.), who introduced the House bill, in a press release. “This new law makes it clear that our nation will always stand by our military families.”

Senate supporters included Sen. John Cornyn (R-Texas), who led that chamber’s version of the bill. He said the bill would “help ensure the Veterans Affairs Department can offer competitive life insurance packages that keep pace with the current cost of living.”

SGLI launched in 1965 with a $10,000 coverage maximum. VGLI began nine years later, allowing veterans to convert SGLI to a five-year term policy. It would later become a renewable, premium-based plan.

Maximum coverage levels for both plans have increased over the decades, but not in regular fashion. It rose from $200,000 to $250,000 in 2001 and to $400,000 in 2005, but remained at the level for nearly two decades until a 2023 law boosted the limit to the current $500,000.

Description:

TRICARE Provider Readiness Designation Trainings

The National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA) for Fiscal Year (FY) 2016 required the development of a system where non-DoD (TRICARE) mental health care providers who meet eligibility criteria established by the Secretary of Defense, could receive a mental health Provider Readiness Designation. These providers would then be specifically highlighted in the TRICARE directory as having earned this designation.

As behavioral health providers who work with military service members, we hear the term ‘readiness’ often and may wonder what it means and how it could impact our work with our military clients. Generally speaking, readiness refers to the military’s capability to do its job, whether that’s during training, combat operations, or humanitarian missions. In order to ensure that the military can meet its missions, commanders need to know if their service members are able to deploy or work in an austere environment for an extended period of time.

To receive this designation, providers must demonstrate knowledge related to military culture and evidence-based treatments that have been approved by the Department of Defense for the treatment of mental health issues among members of the Armed Forces. This is demonstrated by completing the package of courses listed on this document which have been developed by the Center for Deployment Psychology and approved by the Government.

The six (6) courses are:

Assessing Military Clients for Trauma and Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder

This workshop will review a method for screening, assessing, and treatment outcome monitoring of Posttraumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) centered on the use of the PTSD Checklist for DSM-5 (PCL-5). Participants will be introduced to VA/DOD best practices for diagnosing military-related PTSD including screening for trauma-related disorders, obtaining thorough military and trauma histories, conducting a semi-structured diagnostic interview, and using self-report measures to track treatment outcome. DSM-5 diagnostic criteria for PTSD as well as Other Unspecified Specified Trauma and/or Stressor-Related Disorders are reviewed. Tools for assessing PTSD and common comorbid conditions are discussed including appropriate use of the PCL-5, Life Events Checklist for DSM-5 (LEC-5), Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9), and Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test-Consumption Questions (AUDIT-C). Semi-structured clinical interviewing techniques are reviewed as they relate to screening, diagnostic assessment, and tracking treatment outcomes. Unique variables that can impact the assessment and feedback process with a military population are identified.

Ethical Considerations for Working with Military Members and Veterans

Civilian behavioral health providers working with military service members and veterans often face ethical challenges unique to this population. Ethical practice is contingent on effective application of personal and cultural morals, as well as on following professional regulations and expectations. Information about informed consent, boundaries of cultural and clinical competence, disposition-driven diagnoses, multiple relationships, and professional fitness are all presented in the context of work with military-connected clients. Decision-making models are included to address ethical dilemmas, with specific presentation of the role of dual relationships within a clinical framework.

Military Culture: Enhancing Clinical Competence

This training is designed for civilian behavioral health providers who want to develop a better understanding about military culture so they can more effectively engage with Service members in their clinical work. The training presents information about who comprises the armed forces as well as basics about organizational structure, branches of service, core values, military missions and operations, as well as the differences between the active and reserve components.

Addressing Suicide with Military-Connected Patients

This training provides a general overview of suicide prevention with military-connected clients. It begins with a comparison of suicide rates for military and civilian populations. Next, it explores myths about suicide and stigma within the military that can result from those myths. Finally, crisis intervention skills are addressed including a review of the steps for safety planning and lethal means safety counseling. The training ends with a review of suggested resources and next steps for additional learning.

An Overview of Sleep Disorders Common in Military Members

In this training participants will gain an understanding of common sleep disorders and sleep-related problems for military members. The presentation focuses on providing strategies to enhance the ability of mental health providers to assess, refer, and identify evidence-based treatments for the top two sleep disorders in military populations.

The Use of Screening Tools

This is an intermediate training that provides behavioral health providers with a general overview regarding the use of screening tools that are utilized with military populations. It starts with reviewing the benefits of utilizing screening tools and exploring limitations. Next, the training reviews specific screening tools for common mental health problems to review their rationale, interpretation, and how to apply those results to clinical decision making. The training includes multiple case examples to apply information about screening tools, as well as discussions on additional considerations such as liability concerns and data storage. This training focuses on utilizing empirically supported screening tools and how to incorporate those results into clinical decision making that have credible empirical support in the literature (i.e., Barry et al., 2023; Duffy et al., 2023; VA/DoD , 2023, 2024, 2025).

Retired Navy Cmdr. Jack Gillett first trained his eyes on the sky as a boy growing up on the California coast. He’d join his mother, a volunteer with the Aircraft Warning Service during World War II, at observation posts and watch for aircraft all night. He never forgot the thrill of phoning in their sightings.

Gillett spent his spare money on model airplanes. There were plastic ones and wooden ones and then flying models.

“Even in high school, dating took a backseat to model airplanes,” he recalled. “My dad told me he was not surprised when I went into aviation.”

Gillett was enrolled in junior college when Navy recruiters showed up and offered to take students to an airport for a ride in trainer planes. He learned that if he had 60 credit hours and could pass a series of tests, he could begin flight training. It was February 1964.

“I didn’t know a Vietnam War was coming,” he said. “But the Navy did.”

Previously aimless, Gillett had found his passion. And he excelled, pinning on his wings at 21. After 15 months as a flight instructor, he reported to his first A-7 squadron. A year and a half later, he was in Vietnam. He would return twice more.

[GET INVOLVED: Find a MOAA Chapter | MOAA Virtual Chapters]

After 20 years of service that included stints as a housekeeper for the vice president, a personal aid to the Navy’s budget director, among others, he retired and returned home to Bakersfield, Calif., and took over the family’s sand and gravel business. After the business shut down, he learned about a position at a high school as a Navy Junior ROTC (JROTC) program and applied. By then, Gillett had been retired for 20 years and required a special waiver for the job. He stood up the program and ran it for six years.

“I really enjoy working with youth,” he said. “I had a really good rapport with them.”

Four years ago, after moving from California to Colorado, Gillett joined the Pikes Peak Chapter just as it was gearing back up after the pandemic. The role of ROTC coordinator was among several unfilled chapter positions.

“I volunteered right away,” he said.

Gillett has been instrumental in growing the chapter’s support of ROTC and JROTC in the area, expanding the number of sponsored units from five to 18, including adding six in just the past year. They include schools in Colorado Springs, Canyon City, and Pueblo, Colo. The latter hadn’t had an official MOAA sponsor in several years.

Additionally, by working with the chapter scholarship committee, Gillett has arranged the award of 18 $1,000 scholarships to one ROTC unit and each of the 17 JROTC units. He also coordinates the chapter’s annual ROTC/JROTC Recognition Luncheon, during which each JROTC unit receives a $300 stipend to support their operations. The work keeps him busy, he said, and he enjoys it.

When Gillett thinks about his volunteer work, he thinks of his mother watching the sky, teaching him by example the value of service.

Care reattraction to keep patients in the Military Health System is ""about trust and getting patients to choose military hospitals when they can,"" Cordts explained.
He noted an external, nationally recognized benchmark can influence where beneficiaries choose care: ""A five-star rating signals quality, builds confidence, and can help reattract patients to military hospitals when they have options in civilian networks.""","Fifteen Defense Health Agency facilities earned top marks from the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services for how well they prepare patients to leave the hospital, according to an analysis by Becker’s Hospital Review.

The report identified 15 military hospitals and clinics that received a five-star rating for “Care Transitions” from CMS. The rating reflects how patients judged their discharge planning and follow-up instructions after an inpatient stay — a critical time in the patient care journey, said Dr. Paul Cordts, DHA deputy assistant director, medical affairs.

“A five-star CMS rating in care transitions shows our teams exceed national benchmarks during one of the most risk-prone moments in care,” he said, noting that strong care coordination, teamwork, and patient-centered discharge planning led to the CMS recognition.

CMS listed hospital and clinic ratings based on the Hospital Consumer Assessment of Healthcare Providers and Systems survey, asking patients about their experience during a recent inpatient hospital stay. Responses were drawn from adult patients discharged from general acute care hospitals in the previous 30 days. The survey was completed between October 2023 and September 2024, and data was updated July 16, 2025.

60th Medical Group, Travis Air Force Base, California

96th Medical Group, Eglin Air Force Base, Florida

81st Medical Group, Keesler Air Force Base, Biloxi, Mississippi

88th Medical Group, Wright-Patterson Air Force Base, Ohio

99th Medical Group, Nellis Air Force Base, Nevada

Evans Army Community Hospital, Fort Carson, Colorado

Eisenhower Army Medical Center, Fort Gordon, Georgia

Martin Army Community Hospital, Fort Moore, Georgia

Womack Army Medical Center, Fort Liberty, North Carolina

Brooke Army Medical Center, Joint Base San Antonio–Fort Sam Houston, Texas

Carl R. Darnall Army Medical Center, Fort Cavazos, Texas

William Beaumont Army Medical Center, Fort Bliss, Texas

Madigan Army Medical Center, Joint Base Lewis-McChord, Washington

Alexander T. Augusta Military Medical Center, Fort Belvoir, Virginia

Walter Reed National Military Medical Center, Bethesda, Maryland

Cordts said the recognition demonstrates the agency’s commitment to operational readiness: “By taking superior care of the patient, the DHA also takes care of the warfighter.”

Measuring patient experience

CMS scored hospitals and clinics through a survey asking patients to rate their health care experience through three key components:

During this hospital stay, staff took my preferences and those of my family or caregiver into account in deciding what my health care needs would be when I left.

When I left the hospital, I clearly understood the purpose for taking each of my medications.

Dr. Kristen Atterbury, DHA chief nursing officer, said those questions showed patients understood what to do after hospitalization — such as how to manage recovery, take medications correctly, and follow instructions — that can reduce complications and avoidable readmissions. “When we do those three things well, we empower patients, improve safety, and build trust,” she said.

Sharing decision-making, clearly communicating responsibilities, and thorough medication education are “cornerstones of a safe and positive patient experience,” while helping relieve the burden of recovering from injury and illness, Atterbury said. “A stressed and distracted service member is not a ready one.”

Aligning with DHA lines of effort

Cordts and Atterbury said the recognition correlates directly with DHA’s priorities of combat support, care reattraction, and enterprise services optimization.

Combat support “helps the force stay ready. A ready medical force supports a ready fighting force,” Cordts said.

Care reattraction to keep patients in the Military Health System is ""about trust and getting patients to choose military hospitals when they can,"" Cordts explained. He noted an external, nationally recognized benchmark can influence where beneficiaries choose care: ""A five-star rating signals quality, builds confidence, and can help reattract patients to military hospitals when they have options in civilian networks.""

Enterprise services optimization “uses what works and spreading it across the whole system,” Atterbury said. “The goal is to take strong steps — such as good discharge checklists and follow-up calls — and use them everywhere. This creates a standardized playbook for excellence, optimizing performance, reducing unwanted variation, and elevating the quality of care across the entire enterprise.”

The award gives DHA the opportunity to share best practices across the MHS, using patient feedback to refine discharge planning, medication counseling, and follow-up coordination — equipping warfighters to stay healthy while continuing recovery at home. This phase of the patient care journey can be vital to stay ready, said Atterbury. “A stable, and well-supported family at home enables a focused, mission-ready force in the field.”

Ultimately, the high marks received from CMS demonstrate DHA’s commitment to mission readiness, said Cordts.

“Excelling at care transitions is a strategic linchpin for the DHA,” he said. “It simultaneously enhances warfighter readiness by ensuring family well-being, attracts patients back to the direct care system, and provides a blueprint for system-wide improvement that is central to enterprise optimization.”",https://d1ldvf68ux039x.cloudfront.net/thumbs/photos/2506/9124347/1000w_q95.jpg,N,0.0,2026-01-13 15:56:38.743107

That distinction between activation/deactivation (on or off active duty orders) versus separation/discharge is what I kept explaining, and hearing it confirmed by someone who actually speaks the military language is incredibly reassuring.
After multiple calls, that kind of pushback really starts to make you doubt yourself.
Even if the premium lock-in part is still a gray area, having the language validated helps a lot.
I appreciate you taking the time to respond.","Thank you so much for this — this is exactly the clarification I was trying to get across.

That distinction between activation/deactivation (on or off active duty orders) versus separation/discharge is what I kept explaining, and hearing it confirmed by someone who actually speaks the military language is incredibly reassuring.

I think what got to me was less the uncertainty of the answer and more being made to feel like I didn’t understand the terminology, when I knew I was using it correctly. After multiple calls, that kind of pushback really starts to make you doubt yourself.

So genuinely — thank you. Even if the premium lock-in part is still a gray area, having the language validated helps a lot. I appreciate you taking the time to respond.",,N,0.0,2026-01-12 22:56:57.844093
