Program Origin

ILER was approved in January 2013 as a Joint Incentive Fund initiative to support White House Presidential directives for managing beneficiary and deployment health needs.

What ILER Is:

ILER is a secure, centralized system that gathers and integrates data from multiple sources.

Information includes unit assignments, deployment records, environmental monitoring systems, and known hazard reports.

The ILER platform provides consolidated, career-long exposure information that’s been submitted for individual service members. Exposures may have occurred in combat zones, during training, or in garrison environments.

Privacy and data security are central to ILER’s design.

Access is strictly limited to authorized DOW and VA personnel and is governed by robust federal data protection standards.

For veterans, ILER can play a vital role in the VA disability claims process.

ILER helps verify exposure history, especially when a veteran’s recollections can be confirmed with documented environmental or unit-based data.

Ultimately, ILER is a major step forward in the military’s commitment to lifelong care for service members and veterans. By improving how we track, understand and respond to environmental and occupational exposures, ILER helps us recognize and better support service member and veteran’s health concerns.

The action is consistent with the Defense Health Agency’s (DHA) ongoing concern over the use of opioids by active-duty members of the military and calls to make non-addictive alternatives for pain management more readily available to military personnel.

The amendment was introduced by Rep. Greg Steube (R-Fla.). It reflects upon the Floyd D. Spence National Defense Authorization Act (Public Law 106-398), which in 2001 established the original chiropractic benefit in the Department of Defense's healthcare system.

The Steube amendment responds to chiropractic clinic closures over the past year caused by contracts with participating doctors of chiropractic being allowed to elapse. It calls on DHA to develop a plan to reopen closed clinics and to explore the feasibility of putting chiropractors stationed at military facilities in the federal General Schedule (GS) system. The amendment also directs DHA to report back to the House and Senate on its progress by March 31, 2026.

Surveys show chiropractic services are highly valued at U.S. military facilities. Reports show that these clinics provide proven, cost-effective care to hundreds of patients monthly, offering a range of non-drug services to address painful musculoskeletal conditions commonly experienced by members of the military and enabling them to return to service.

“We thank Rep. Steube for his foresight to tackle this issue and we also acknowledge House Armed Services Committee Chair Rep. Mike Rogers (R-Ala.) for his long-standing support of chiropractic in the military,” said John Falardeau, American Chiropractic Association (ACA) senior vice president of public policy and advocacy.

A four-year clinical trial conducted at several military sites—the largest chiropractic clinical trial on record—showed evidence that chiropractic care, when added to usual medical care, resulted in moderate short-term improvements in low back pain intensity in active-duty personnel. The results of the trial, published in 2018 by JAMA Network Open, served as additional support for the inclusion of chiropractic services as a component of multidisciplinary health care for back pain, as currently recommended by existing guidelines.

The Steube amendment was made part of the larger National Defense Authorization Act, which now goes to the Senate for consideration. ACA will be working with senators to ensure the provision remains in the final defense package.

Walter Reed Leads the Way in Integrating Pain and Substance Use Disorder Care

By Roan Smith, WRNMMC Office of Command Communications

Walter Reed National Military Medical Center recently hosted a Pain Care Skills training and Substance Use Disorder Care event in Washington, DC. For the first time they merged two traditionally separate annual events with the intent to gather international experts and military professionals with a shared goal: improving pain management for service members, veterans and war-impacted civilians.

Effective pain care is directly tied to readiness, recovery and quality of life—not only for active-duty service members preparing to return to duty, but also for veterans and civilian patients who look to Walter Reed for presidential-level care.

This year’s training brought together military and civilian providers from across the country, with both in-person and virtual sessions designed to improve how providers treat pain and prevent substance use disorder.

By integrating substance use disorder and pain treatment, Walter Reed is modeling a new standard of care that not only serves military beneficiaries but also influences best practices across health systems.

“We’re really leading the Military Health System—and even the civilian communities—in integrating care for both substance use disorder and pain,” said Dr. Christopher Spevak, director of the National Capital Region’s (NCR) Opioid Safey Program and the deputy director of the NCR’s Pain Initiative and Wounded Warrior Pain Care Initiative. “By bringing these groups together, it becomes a force multiplier in terms of taking care of patients.”

The symposium combined nine virtual meetings and 24 in-person workshops, creating a blended model of education that brought together internationally recognized experts and hands-on training. Online sessions included topics such as Dopamine Nation and the Pleasure-Pain Balance by Dr. Anna Lembke of Stanford, An Overview of the Management of Benzodiazepine Use Disorder by Dr. Logan Adam, and Artificial Technology in Pain Medicine: Transforming Assessment and Treatment Through Technology. In-Person workshops provided practical skills in therapists ranging from battlefield acupuncture and medical hypnosis to musculoskeletal ultrasound, art therapy, dry needling and cupping.

“This blended format allows us to reach a wide audience while ensuring providers gain practical, skills-based training,” said Spevak. “It’s something that isn’t being modeled anywhere else.”

This year also featured the International Pain Working Group, which brought together military physicians from partner nations including Germany, France, Georgia, and Australia. The group aims to share best practices, collaborate on research and improve pain care for service members worldwide.

Lt. Col Alex Kumar, the U.K.’s defense medical services lead for pain managements, stressed the importance of empathy in caring for services members.

“It’s about empathy, it’s about communication,” said Kumar. “Especially for the military population — these people have put their lives at risk. So, it is our duty to give them the best possible care we can.”

The training also showcased lessons from the battlefield. Dr. Marshall Bedder, a former Navy commander described his deployment experience. “In Kandahar in 2014, all battlefield injuries were treated by medics with nasal ketamine, and we had amazing success with that,” said Bedder. “This ability to use a nasal mister is so simple.”

By blending clinical research, real-world lessons, and hands-on skills, this year’s Pain Care Skills Training reinforced Walter Reed’s Leadership in advancing pain care across military health system and beyond.

Walter Reed’s Pain Management team continues to deliver world-class care that supports the readiness of our force and he health of our community. For more information about Walter Reed’s Pain Management Clinic talk to your primary care provider.

If you go 63 days or more in a row without Medicare drug coverage or other creditable prescription drug coverage, you may have to pay a penalty if you sign up for Medicare drug coverage later.
So, Americans with “creditable” coverage can apply for a Medicare Part D plan at a later date without paying a penalty.
(Chapter 5 of the Medicare Survival Guide Advanced edition explains Medicare Part D and how to avoid Part D penalties).
Medicare calculates the Part D penalty by multiplying 1% of the “national base beneficiary premium” ($36.78 in 2025) by the number of full, uncovered months you didn’t have either Part D or creditable coverage and rounding to the nearest 10 cents.","UNITED STATES—Hello Toni: When I turned 65 in May 2024, I continued to work full-time with a health savings account HSA as my employer benefits and use GoodRX to cover prescriptions. My employer’s human resources manager advised me to enroll in Medicare Part A when I turned 65, which was not correct information because I could not fund my HSA from the time I enrolled in Medicare Part A. When I retire at 70 is when I will enroll in Medicare Part B.

Now I am experiencing a Medicare issue and need guidance, Toni. In July, I applied on medicare.gov for a Medicare Part D plan to begin Aug. 1 because I am now taking an expensive blood pressure prescription that GoodRX does not cover which costs over $650 a month.

I just received a notice from Medicare saying they do not have a record of me having prescription drug coverage that “met Medicare’s minimum standards” from 5/1/2024 to 7/31/2025, and I will receive a Part D late enrollment penalty. What does this mean?

Toni…Thank you in advance,

Don from Charlotte, NC

Don: I do not have good news for you. You have a Medicare Part D prescription drug penalty problem because you did not enroll in a Medicare Part D plan at the right time when your Part A began 5/1/2024. Unfortunately, prescription discount programs — such as GoodRx, Single Care, AmazonRX or store prescription memberships such as Walmart, Kroger, etc., are not considered “creditable” coverage which is why you will be receiving Medicare’s late enrollment penalty (LEP).

The Medicare & You handbook states: Creditable prescription drug coverage could include drug coverage from a current or former employer or union, TRICARE, Indian Health Service, the Department of Veterans Affairs, or individual health insurance coverage. If you go 63 days or more in a row without Medicare drug coverage or other creditable prescription drug coverage, you may have to pay a penalty if you sign up for Medicare drug coverage later.

So, Americans with “creditable” coverage can apply for a Medicare Part D plan at a later date without paying a penalty. (Chapter 5 of the Medicare Survival Guide Advanced edition explains Medicare Part D and how to avoid Part D penalties).

The Late Enrollment Penalty (LEP) when applying for Medicare Part D can be applied if:

— You are older than 65, retiring and leaving employer benefits and waited more than 63 days without creditable prescription drug coverage to enroll in Part D. (Filing Medicare forms with Social Security does not inform Medicare that you had creditable prescription drug coverage. Do not wait to enroll in a Part D plan.)

–Your prescription drug benefit (not health benefits) is not creditable as Medicare defines it.

–You never enrolled in Medicare Part D when first eligible for Medicare.

Medicare calculates the Part D penalty by multiplying 1% of the “national base beneficiary premium” ($36.78 in 2025) by the number of full, uncovered months you didn’t have either Part D or creditable coverage and rounding to the nearest 10 cents. That amount is added to your monthly Part D premium.

Your late enrollment period (LEP) does not begin from the day you lose or leave your company health plan, but from the month your Medicare Part A started. So, Don, your 14 months without creditable coverage will cost you an extra $5.15 per month plus the Part D premium for 2025. The national base amount can change each year, so your penalty will change and NEVER go away.

Remember with Medicare what you don’t know that WILL hurt you! Please enroll in Medicare Part D whether you are taking prescriptions or not.

”At the Army Heat Center, we frequently see cases of exertional rhabdomyolysis, either secondary to heat illness or on its own.
Civilian clinicians may also find it a valuable reference when treating exertional rhabdomyolysis in athletic or occupational settings.
Army Heat Center S. Army Heat Center HPRC (WHEC resource hub): https://www.hprc-online.org/resources-partners/whec ***","Newswise — Bethesda, Md. — The Uniformed Services University (USU), in partnership with the U.S. Army Heat Center and other Department of Defense collaborators, has released the a recently updated standardized Clinical Practice Guideline (CPG) for the Management of Exertional Rhabdomyolysis (ER) in Warfighters. Developed through USU’s Consortium for Health and Military Performance (CHAMP) and the Warfighter Heat- and Exertion-Related Events Collaborative (WHEC), this guideline provides military clinicians with a critical, evidence-based framework to identify, manage, and return Service Members to duty following this potentially dangerous condition.

Exertional rhabdomyolysis—muscle breakdown caused by strenuous activity—can escalate quickly to serious complications, including acute kidney injury (AKI). The updated guideline standardizes recognition, risk stratification, treatment, and return-to-duty (RTD) decisions across the Military Health System, ensuring timely and consistent care while protecting Service Members and strengthening operational readiness. Importantly, while designed with Warfighters in mind, the principles outlined in the guideline also have broad application for civilian populations—including athletes, first responders, and others who engage in intense physical activity.

“We are very pleased to release this 2025 Rhabdomyolysis CPG update, which presents multiple significant changes and additions from our 2020 product,” said Dr. Francis O’Connor, professor of Military and Emergency Medicine and medical director of CHAMP. “Our joint service team of DoD providers, representing hundreds of years of military relevant experience, has worked very hard to share the most current evidence-based information to our military colleagues to optimize the diagnosis and initial management of warfighters impacted by exertional rhabdomyolysis, and importantly, facilitate return to duty decisions.”

The extensively updated guideline sets a clear standard for diagnosing exertional rhabdomyolysis, helping doctors recognize the condition earlier and with greater accuracy. It also gives medical teams a way to quickly sort patients into low-, or high-risk categories to assist in both initial management and return to duty decisions. High-risk warning signs include significantly elevated muscle enzyme levels, signs of dangerous muscle pressure inside the muscles (compartment syndrome), lab results that show kidney damage, very dark urine, serious chemical imbalances in the blood, or having the sickle cell trait. Another important tool introduced in this update is the McMahon Score, which combines lab results and patient information to help predict the chance of severe kidney injury or the need for dialysis. Patients are also considered higher risk if their situation makes it hard to ensure close medical follow-up.

For patients who need to be admitted to the hospital, the guideline recommends treatments that protect the kidneys and close monitoring for those at moderate to high risk of complications. For patients who can be managed outside the hospital, it provides a clear step-by-step approach focused on staying well-hydrated, limiting activity, and coming back for a check-up within 24–72 hours. This outpatient pathway is especially important for lower-risk cases or when exertional rhabdomyolysis is suspected but not yet confirmed.

Decisions about returning to duty are guided by a gradual, staged process. Low-risk patients start with rest, fluids, and careful monitoring, then slowly move through reconditioning phases until they can safely return to full activity if symptoms don’t return. Patients at higher risk, or those who experience the condition more than once, require a tailored plan that involves input from medical specialists. To support clinicians in these decisions, the guideline includes practical tools such as step-by-step flow charts, a glossary of terms, and appendices that address duty profiles, return-to-duty guidance, and medical coding.

”At the Army Heat Center, we frequently see cases of exertional rhabdomyolysis, either secondary to heat illness or on its own. Unlike exertional heat stroke, prior to the development of this CPG, return-to-duty guidance was lacking,” said Army Lt. Col. (Dr.) David DeGroot, director of the Army Heat Center. “Now, providers have a resource to help as they work to return the injured warfighter to duty as quickly as possible but without jeopardizing their health or increasing risk of reoccurrence.”

The CPG is designed for use by military primary care, emergency medicine, sports medicine, and operational clinicians, as well as command medical leaders overseeing training, selection, and deployment cycles. Civilian clinicians may also find it a valuable reference when treating exertional rhabdomyolysis in athletic or occupational settings.

The House voted 231-196 to pass the legislation, with four Republicans voting against it: Reps. Tim Burchett, Marjorie Taylor Greene, Anna Paulina Luna and Thomas Massie. Seventeen Democrats voted in support. The massive bill authorizes $848 billion in defense spending for fiscal year 2026.

“We didn’t get any of the amendments and the debates that we wanted; not a single solitary one,” Rep. Adam Smith, the ranking member of the House Armed Services committee, said, according to Politico. “Meanwhile, all manner of different issues that are pure culture war partisan issues were allowed in. I fear that many of those are going to pass.”

The NDAA struggled to gain popularity among Democrats within the Armed Services Committee, but still ultimately passed out of committee by a vote of 55-2, even after several provisions were added to block gender-affirming medical care from being accepted under Tricare and an amendment to repeal the 1991 and 2002 laws authorizing the use of military force.

Republicans were eager to tout the legislation passing, though it still has to pass the Senate.

“The FY-26 [defense authorization bill] cuts red tape, streamlines bureaucracy, and refocuses acquisition on its most important mission: getting our warfighters what they need when they need it,” Rep. Mike Rogers, the chair of the Armed Services Committee, said in a statement.

House Speaker Mike Johnson said the policy bill ensures American “military forces remain the most lethal in the world and can deter any adversary.”

“This legislation advances President Trump and House Republicans’ Peace Through Strength Agenda by codifying 15 of President Trump’s executive orders, ending woke ideology at the Pentagon, securing the border, revitalizing the defense industrial base, and restoring the warrior ethos,” Johnson said in a statement.

The bill now heads to conference with the Senate later this year.

“I came to Congress to make sure our military has what it needs to fight and win, and that our servicemembers and their families are never taken for granted,” said Congresswoman Kiggans. “While there is more work to do as the bill heads to conference, I will continue fighting to ensure the final NDAA keeps America’s Navy the strongest in the world and delivers for the men and women who call Hampton Roads home.”

The FY26 NDAA carries forward President Trump’s peace through strength agenda while addressing the urgent needs of servicemembers and their families. It supports a 3.8% pay raise, expands military bonuses and special pays, reforms the Basic Needs Allowance by removing Base Allowance for Housing (BAH) from income calculations, and invests over $1.4 billion in new barracks and family housing construction. The bill strengthens healthcare access by preventing cuts to military medical billets, authorizing major hospital renovations, improving TRICARE coverage for pregnant women and reservists, and expanding mental health services and studies, including a new longitudinal review of traumatic brain injuries and the unique impacts of G-force exposure on military pilots. It also expands commissary and MWR access to civil service mariners and increases childcare resources, with more than $361 million authorized for new childcare centers.

“As a proud Navy veteran, military spouse, and Mom, I know that taking care of our servicemembers and their families is the foundation of our national defense,” said Congresswoman Kiggans. “This year’s NDAA delivers for Hampton Roads by strengthening naval aviation and shipbuilding, protecting access to quality health care for military children, and ensuring the quality-of-life our troops and families deserve. I’m proud to have secured these wins for Virginia’s Second District and for servicemembers around the globe.”

The NDAA ensures Hampton Roads remains at the forefront of America’s naval readiness. It requires the Navy to provide a detailed plan for basing F-35C squadrons, advances shipyard modernization through cost-saving software evaluation, and authorizes over $22 billion in new shipbuilding, including a Columbia-class submarine, Virginia-class submarine, and Ford-class aircraft carrier. The bill also establishes a National Commission on the Maritime Industrial Base to recommend policies that revitalize American shipbuilding and protect long-term naval readiness.

Congresswoman Kiggans also secured several floor amendment victories that directly support servicemembers and their families. These include new protections requiring timely electronic notices for TRICARE beneficiaries before coverage transitions, stronger oversight of PCS reimbursements and the family impacts of frequent moves, and reforms to make housing allowances more responsive to rising costs of living. She advanced provisions to implement GAO’s recommendations on improving military housing, authorized cost-plus contracts to accelerate shipyard infrastructure modernization, and required reports on installing rotary-wing collision avoidance systems to enhance aviator safety.

Yet the Defense Health Agency has terminated coverage of weight-loss medications for 2.5 million Medicare-eligible veterans in Tricare for Life — the Tricare plan for Medicare-eligible military retirees and their Medicare-eligible family members — while continuing to cover the exact same prescriptions for younger retirees.

This is not just unfair, it is unlawful.

In 2001, Congress ended decades of second-class treatment for older retirees with the creation of the Senior Pharmacy Program, guaranteeing Medicare-eligible retirees the same pharmacy coverage as younger beneficiaries.

Lawmakers also restored full Tricare eligibility for those enrolling in Medicare Part B. The intent was clear: Service members would no longer see benefits curtailed simply because they turned 65.

A governing statute — 10 U.S.C. § 1074g — reinforces that commitment by requiring a uniform formulary of covered drugs for all beneficiaries.

The Defense Department’s own 2002 rule was equally unambiguous, promising Medicare-eligible retirees “the same coverage for pharmacy services and the same requirements for cost-sharing and reimbursement.”

For more than 20 years, that promise held. When I turned 65, nothing changed: same formulary, same co-pays, same access. Until now.

DOD’s misreading

The Defense Health Agency now claims authority to deny Tricare for Life beneficiaries coverage for GLP-1 medications by invoking 32 C.F.R. § 199.17(f)(3), a regulation stating that treatment of obesity is covered under Tricare Prime and Select “notwithstanding” a statutory exclusion that applied to dependents in § 1079(a)(10).

The logic is tortured. First, § 1079(a)(10) governs dependent coverage, not retiree benefits.

The obesity exclusion was added in the 1970s to prevent the Civilian Health and Medical Program of the Uniform Services (CHAMPUS) from paying for elective weight-loss clinics for spouses and children, not to deny treatment to retirees themselves.

Second, DOD’s own regulation at § 199.17(a)(6)(ii)(C) flatly states that Tricare for Life is “unaffected by this section.”

In plain English: The regulation DHA cites does not apply to Tricare for Life.

Third, when Congress addressed obesity treatment in the FY 2017 National Defense Authorization Act, it did so by authorizing programs for all “covered beneficiaries,” not by singling out Prime and Select.

The Pentagon elected to implement that authority narrowly — it was not required. That choice cannot override a statutory command for a uniform formulary.

The human cost

This is not an abstract dispute. It is a matter of health and dignity for older veterans.

Without coverage, the monthly cost for me and every other retiree on TFL ranges from $499 at best to $1,349 at retail.

On a fixed retirement income, that is devastating.

Meanwhile, a 64-year-old retiree on Tricare Select pays a $35 co-pay for the same drug. The only difference between us is that I lived long enough to become Medicare-eligible.

And it is cruelly targeted. Older adults are more likely to suffer from obesity, less able to lose weight through exercise, and least able to absorb thousands of dollars in new drug costs.

Many suffer mobility issues caused by service-connected injuries. After decades of service, we now are asked to choose between essential medications and groceries.

The Pentagon’s misreading of its own rules cannot stand.

Congress should: Suspend the policy immediately pending review, investigate how DHA justified such a clear violation of statutory and regulatory text, clarify by statute that no drug on the uniform formulary may be denied to Tricare for Life beneficiaries if it is available to any other Tricare enrollee and require public accountability by compelling DOD to explain why it used a regulation that expressly excludes Tricare for Life to strip benefits from older veterans.

“Tricare for Life” was meant to be just that — for life. Not “for life with exceptions,” not “for life until you’re too old.”

The law promises uniform coverage for all beneficiaries.

By twisting a regulation, DOD has broken faith with those who served longest.

If the Pentagon believes these medications are too costly, it should seek new authorization from Congress — not engage in bureaucratic sleight of hand that punishes seniors.",https://www.navycrf.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/cropped-favicon-32x32.png,N,0.0,2025-09-11 03:56:12.733202

“None of these amendments are remotely necessary,” said Rep. Adam Smith of Washington, the top Democrat on the Armed Services Committee.
“They are an effort to take advantage of a culture-war partisan issue to drive a wedge into this bill.
It also builds on the quality-of-life improvements for military members initiated under last year’s defense policy bill.
Service members would see a 3.8% pay raise under the bill, as requested by the Trump administration.","WASHINGTON — The House approved an annual defense policy bill on Wednesday that authorizes a 3.8% pay raise for troops, bolsters support for European partners and restricts gender-affirming medical treatment.

Many Democrats refused to vote for the legislation due to several Republican amendments that target transgender individuals and forbid the Defense Department from funding certain health care for them. The vote was 231-196.

“None of these amendments are remotely necessary,” said Rep. Adam Smith of Washington, the top Democrat on the Armed Services Committee. “They are an effort to take advantage of a culture-war partisan issue to drive a wedge into this bill. It doesn’t belong here.”

The provisions include a ban on Tricare, the military’s health care program, from providing gender-related medical treatment and on the Exceptional Family Medical Program from approving gender transition procedures.

Rep. Nancy Mace, R-S.C., won approval for amendments that prohibit males at military service academies from participating in female athletics and that require individuals on military installations to access single-sex spaces that correspond with their sex.

The Senate is voting on its own version of the legislation, and both chambers will need to negotiate and vote on a final version before the bill can be sent to President Donald Trump’s desk. Divisive social issue provisions are typically stripped from the final bill.

The legislation’s primary focus is on reforming the Pentagon’s slow and costly weapons acquisitions process — reducing decision timelines for requirements from three years to as few as three months.

It also builds on the quality-of-life improvements for military members initiated under last year’s defense policy bill. Service members would see a 3.8% pay raise under the bill, as requested by the Trump administration.

The family separation allowance, which helps offset expenses incurred when a service member is separated from their family for more than 30 days, would go up from $250 to $400 per month.

Eligibility calculations for the basic needs allowance would exclude the basic housing allowance from a service member’s household income to allow more troops to qualify for the benefit.

“These and several other provisions in the bill will certainly positively impact service members’ pocketbooks, and their ability to put food on the table,” said Rep. Chrissy Houlahan, D-Penn.

Another provision waives fees and co-pays for Tricare’s dental program for all members of the selected reserve.

The legislation also extends an at-home child care pilot program and authorizes nearly $3 billion in construction for new barracks and family housing, dining facilities, medical facilities, child care centers and schools.

The bill also pushes back against the Trump administration’s moves to withdraw from Europe.

The House’s legislation authorizes $400 million for the longstanding Ukraine Security Assistance Initiative, and lawmakers added an amendment requiring the Pentagon to maintain military cooperation with Baltic allies Latvia, Lithuania and Estonia.

“This amendment is necessary because there are some appointees in the Pentagon who’ve embraced a foolish policy of decoupling from Europe and weakening our leadership in NATO, and we’ve got to stand opposed,” said Rep. Don Bacon, R-Neb.

Lawmakers also reasserted congressional war powers, approving a bipartisan amendment repealing laws that green-lighted the 2003 Iraq invasion and the 1991 Gulf War. Democrats and some Republicans have raised concerns about presidential abuse of the authorizations.

China remains a top priority in the legislation. The bill authorizes more than $1.5 billion for projects needed to carry out military operations in the Indo-Pacific, and $1 billion for the Taiwan Security Cooperation Initiative to strengthen the island nation’s defense capabilities.

The legislation also authorizes $22 billion in shipbuilding for additional submarines and surface vessels, $38 billion for new aircraft, $15 billion to restore munitions stockpiles and $142 billion to develop new technologies for the battlefield.

“We need a ready, capable and lethal fighting force because the threats our nation faces, especially those from China, are more complex and challenging than at any point in the last 40 years,” said Rep. Mike Rogers, R-Ala., the chairman of the Armed Services Committee.",https://www.stripes.com/incoming/hu6xqf-20250731_us_capitol_0213.jpg/alternates/LANDSCAPE_480/20250731_US_Capitol_0213.jpg,N,0.0,2025-09-11 00:56:10.247821

Horsford, who represents multiple military instillations in Nevada, specifically negotiated to include a bipartisan provision studying the psychological and mental health impacts of combat with Remotely Piloted Aircraft on personnel stationed at Creech Air Force Base in his district.

Rep. Horsford’s legislation, the bipartisan TRICARE OB-GYN Treatment and Access without Lags in Care Act (TOTAL Care Act), which provides servicemembers and their families obstetric and gynecologic (OB-GYN) care without requiring burdensome referrals, was also included in the base text.

“The National Defense Authorization Act is our opportunity to invest in military readiness,” Rep. Horsford said. “I amended this NDAA to help support military families, address mental health challenges our servicemembers endure, and ensure our Air Force units have the resources they need to modernize and succeed. Supporting the troops means supporting their families, their healthcare, and their ability to serve authentically. That’s not a partisan value – it’s a military necessity.

“While I voted in favor of this NDAA, I am concerned that many of the provisions Congressional Republicans included undermine its intent,” Horsford continued. “This bill includes provisions that ban healthcare, undermine equal services, and openly discriminate against the very same patriots who volunteer to serve our country. I expect my colleagues to address these extreme provisions at conference, and I hope to see an improved, bipartisan bill once it returns to the House for final passage.”

Rep. Horsford’s amendments to the NDAA are:

To investigate the financial impact of Permanent Change of Station (PCS) costs on military families.

To undertake a study examining the psychological effects and mental health impacts associated with combat Remotely Piloted Aircraft operations for personnel stationed at Creech Air Force Base.

To provide a formal report on the modernization requirements of the United States Air Force Thunderbirds Demonstration Team.

The centerpiece of the FY26 National Defense Authorization Act is a wide-ranging proposal meant to help speed up and streamline the defense acquisition process, specifically by cutting the time it takes for the Pentagon to validate requirements for a new procurement program.

The bill, which authorizes $848 billion for defense but does not obligate spending, largely sticks to the amounts laid out in the Pentagon’s budget request.

Rep. Adam Smith, the top Democrat on the House Armed Services Committee, announced on Tuesday that he would not support the bill if it included “problematic amendments included in the rule that focus on divisive topics rather than strengthening our national security.” He also criticized House Republicans for blocking debate on Democrat-led amendments on topics such as the Trump administration’s use of the US military for domestic law enforcement.

“We didn’t get any of the amendments or debates that we wanted. Not a single solitary one,” he said on the floor today.

There were two notable shows of bipartisanship. First, Democrats and Republicans largely banded together to defeat amendments from Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, R-Ga., that would have prohibited funding for Ukraine and eradicated funding for the Taiwan Security Cooperation Initiative. (The House NDAA authorizes $400 million for Ukraine, but no money is included in the House’s version of the defense appropriations bill, which actually greenlights the Pentagon’s budget.)

Two Republican members of the House Armed Services Committee — Reps. Don Bacon of Nebraska and Mike Turner of Ohio — spoke against the move to curb further military aid to Ukraine.

“A Ukrainian victory is in our security interests,” Bacon said, adding that Russia could put military pressure on the Baltic countries if Ukraine falls. “It’s not conservative to appease [Russian President Vladimir] Putin,” he added.

The Ukraine funding prohibition was shot down in a 60-372 vote, while the Taiwan amendment was defeated 9-422.

Members also voted in favor of an amendment that repeals the 1991 and 2002 Authorizations for Use of Military Force (AUMF) related to Iraq, which saw 49 Republicans join Democrats in a 261-167 vote. The measure’s cosponsors — Rep. Gregory Meeks, the top Democrat on the House Foreign Affairs Committee, and Rep. Chip Roy, R-Texas — have said the war authorizations are outdated and no longer serve a purpose.

Over Democrats’ objections, Republicans passed six amendments targeting transgender individuals, including one that prohibits the Pentagon from covering gender-related medical treatment under TRICARE.

GOP members also successfully backed an amendment that eliminates a Pentagon preference for hybrid or electric vehicles.

The House’s NDAA will have to be reconciled with the Senate’s version of the bill, which authorizes a topline that is $32 billion larger than the House version. The Senate is also debating its NDAA on the floor this week, with passage likely by end of week.

“I think it’s very interesting that my colleague from South Carolina is so obsessed with the issue of trans people,” Democratic California Rep. Sara Jacobs said Wednesday, referring to Republican Rep. Nancy Mace. (RELATED: NANCY MACE: America Has A 1% Problem But It’s Not What The Left Thinks)

Jacobs accused Mace of “using horrible slurs to talk about [transgender-identified people], when many people in this body have received gender affirming care.”

The House is set to vote on a slew of Mace-introduced amendments, including an amendment to prohibit the Department of War “from allocating taxpayer resources toward gender-transition procedures or treatments through TRICARE,” a military healthcare program. Another of Mace’s amendment’s prohibits “biological males [from] competing against our daughters in uniform.”

“Filler is gender affirming care,” Jacobs claimed. “Boob jobs is gender affirming care. Botox is gender affirming care.”

“Lots of my colleagues have received gender affirming care,” Jacobs maintained, no doubt pleased with her passive aggressive line of attack.

Sara Jacobs (D-Calif.) on the House floor Wednesday over a comment Jacobs made saying that breast augmentations are gender-affirming care, with Mace later taking to social media to offer Jacobs a surgeon for a nose job.

The outburst came during debate on amendments to the annual defense authorization bill, with Mace leading several anti-transgender amendments, including one to prevent gender-affirming care under the military’s TRICARE health benefits.

“I would just like to point out that it’s interesting my colleague from South Carolina is so obsessed with the issue of trans people, using horrible slurs to talk about them, when many people in this body have received gender-affirming care,” Jacobs said on the House floor.

Mace, who was no longer recognized for debate and was elsewhere on the House floor, could be heard yelling at Jacobs for making comments about “my body.”

“Ridiculous,” Mace said. “You are absolutely ridiculous. What the hell is your problem?”

“You are disgusting. You are an insult,” Mace said, as the presiding officers gaveled and said that the House was not in order.

Jacobs requested to have Mace’s words be taken down — stricken from the official record — but no additional parliamentary consideration occurred because Mace was not recognized during the outburst.

Mace, who has made her personal stories of sexual assault and advocacy against transgender rights core to her political identity, then took to social media to continue scolding Jacobs.

“To @RepSaraJacobs, I talk about women’s safety and your response is commentary about my body on the House floor. If you knew anything about survivors you would know some women change their bodies because of the trauma of sexual violence. They live with the consequences for a lifetime,” Mace said.

The company's recent financial and operational updates underscore a critical inflection point: a transition from growth-at-all-costs to disciplined scalability and profitability. This transformation, driven by Converge's SaaS-based architecture, is not merely a technological upgrade but a recalibration of Amwell's value proposition in an industry increasingly demanding efficiency and measurable outcomes.

Converge's Role in Revenue Resilience and Margin Expansion

Amwell's Q2 2025 results reveal a company recalibrating its financial trajectory. Total revenue reached $70.9 million, surpassing analyst estimates by 11.7%, with subscription software revenue—a direct indicator of Converge's adoption—jumping to $40.4 million, up 47% year-over-year and 24% sequentiallyAmerican Well (AMWL) Q2 Revenue Up 13%[ 1 ]. This growth is not isolated to volume; it reflects a structural shift in client demand. The Converge platform, which integrates virtual care, care coordination, and analytics, now accounts for 60% of Amwell's projected 2025 revenueAmerican Well Q2 2025 Earnings Report[ 2 ].

The platform's impact extends beyond top-line growth. Gross margin expanded to 56.1% in Q2 2025, a 500-basis-point improvement year-over-yearAmerican Well (AMWL) Q2 Revenue Up 13%[ 1 ]. This margin expansion, coupled with a narrowing adjusted EBITDA loss of $4.7 million (down 86.6% from Q2 2024), signals progress in balancing investment in growth with operational disciplineAmerican Well (AMWL) Q2 Revenue Up 13%[ 1 ]. The key driver here is Converge's scalable SaaS model, which reduces per-unit costs as adoption rises—a critical advantage in an industry historically plagued by high fixed costs.

Strategic Partnerships as a Force Multiplier

Amwell's partnership with the U.S. Defense Health Agency (DHA) exemplifies how Converge is becoming a strategic asset rather than a commodity. The DHA contract, which replaces a legacy video solution with Converge's integrated platform, has already tripled virtual visits within the Military Health System (MHS) and achieved high satisfaction ratesAmerican Well Q2 2025 Earnings Report[ 2 ]. This partnership, initially deployed at five sites and now expanding enterprise-wide, is described by Amwell as “the most significant growth initiative in its history”Digital health earnings roundup—The hits and misses in Q1[ 3 ].

The DHA's 9.6 million-member footprint provides a unique testing ground for Converge's capabilities. According to a report by FierceHealthcare, the DHA project has driven a 30% year-over-year increase in subscription software revenueDigital health earnings roundup—The hits and misses in Q1[ 3 ]. More importantly, it validates Converge's ability to scale in complex, high-stakes environments—a credential that enhances Amwell's appeal to other large payers and health systems.

The EBITDA Turnaround: Realistic or Optimistic?

Amwell's revised 2025 revenue guidance of $245–$250 million, despite the divestiture of its psychiatric care segment, reflects confidence in Converge's ability to offset lost revenue streamsAmerican Well (AMWL) Q2 Revenue Up 13%[ 1 ]. However, the path to EBITDA profitability remains contingent on two factors: continued margin expansion and disciplined capital allocation.

The company's adjusted EBITDA loss, while narrowing, still reflects significant investment in platform development and client onboarding. For instance, the DHA rollout required upfront costs to customize Converge for military-specific workflows. Yet, these investments are beginning to pay off: the platform's gross margin of 56.1% in Q2 2025 suggests that Amwell is nearing a breakeven point in its core SaaS operationsAmerican Well (AMWL) Q2 Revenue Up 13%[ 1 ]. If this trend continues, the company could achieve EBITDA positivity by 2026, assuming no major disruptions in client acquisition or cost management.

Risks and Opportunities in the Hybrid Care Market

While Converge's trajectory is promising, Amwell faces headwinds. The healthcare technology sector is highly competitive, with rivals like

and Doxy.me vying for market share. Additionally, regulatory shifts—such as changes in reimbursement models for virtual care—could impact adoption rates.

Yet, Amwell's focus on enterprise clients (e.g., DHA, Florida Blue) provides a buffer against these risks. Enterprise contracts typically offer longer-term commitments and higher margins compared to consumer-facing models. Furthermore, Converge's integration of AI-driven analytics and care coordination tools positions it to capture value in the shift toward value-based care—a $1.2 trillion market by 2030American Well Corp (AMWL) Q1 2025 Earnings Call Highlights[ 4 ].

Conclusion: A Platform, Not Just a Product

Amwell's strategic transformation is no longer theoretical. The Converge platform has demonstrated its ability to drive revenue, improve margins, and secure high-impact partnerships. For investors, the critical question is whether this momentum can translate into sustained EBITDA growth. The data suggests that Amwell is on the right path, but execution will determine the pace.

As the healthcare sector grapples with rising costs and fragmented care delivery, Amwell's hybrid care model offers a compelling alternative.

Walter Reed Office of Command Communications

Surgeons at Walter Reed continue to use innovative approaches to providing presidential-level care to beneficiaries of the Military Health System.

“We used a microsurgical robot to do the microvascular anastomosis [as part of a breast reconstruction],” said U.S. Army Col. (Dr.) Paul Hwang, director for surgery at Walter Reed.

Microvascular anastomosis is surgery reconnecting very small blood vessels, such as those with a diameter of 3mm or less, using a microscope and specialized instruments. It’s crucial in reconstructive surgery, especially when transferring tissue from one part of the body to another or repairing nerves.

“The [microvascular anastomosis is] usually done by hand and a large microscope,” Hwang explained. “This robot allows us to descrub and use remote [controllers] and a 3D video screen to do the anastomosis.”

Hwang’s team performed a DIEP (Deep Inferior Epigastric Perforator) flap for breast reconstruction, which used the patient’s own tissue from the lower abdomen to rebuild the breast following a mastectomy. The microsurgical procedure where the tissue is transferred to the chest and reattached using tiny blood vessels, creating a reconstructed breast with its own blood supply.

Hwang added that using the microsurgical robot “makes the vessel connection more accurate and chances for higher quality anastomosis that is less prone to collapse, clotting, [and] complications.”

Hwang explained that robotic microsurgery studies show improved flap survival and reduced adverse events when compared to literature on manual techniques.

“Robotic assisted microsurgery is a novel approach to tackle some of the most complex reconstructive problems in our field. The potential to have better outcomes in trauma, limb salvage, cancer and lymphedema cases through this technology that is limited in availability throughout the United States, makes it only fitting that Walter Reed leads the way in introducing the use at our flagship military treatment facility,” Hwang added.",https://d1ldvf68ux039x.cloudfront.net/thumbs/photos/2509/9302102/1000w_q95.jpg,N,0.0,2025-09-10 11:56:44.481226

TRICARE For Life beneficiaries

Beneficiaries only eligible for care at military hospitals and clinics

Beneficiaries with NATO status or Partnership for Peace Agreement

At Apple A Day Virtual Clinic, we believe everyone deserves access to safe, effective, and affordable weight loss care. That’s why we continue to provide weight loss medications, medical guidance, and telehealth support without the high costs of traditional care.

What’s Happening with TRICARE Coverage?

TRICARE recently updated its pharmacy benefit policies. Some commonly prescribed weight loss medications, including newer options like GLP-1s (tirzepatide, semaglutide, etc.), are now restricted or not covered for many individuals.

This means:

Patients who were previously covered may now face denials at the pharmacy

Out-of-pocket costs for these medications can skyrocket

Those relying on weight loss medication as part of their care plan may feel stuck

Why Weight Loss Medications Matter

Medications like GLP-1 receptor agonists (e.g., semaglutide, tirzepatide), as well as other weight loss treatments, have been proven to:

Support sustainable weight loss

Improve blood sugar levels

Reduce risks for conditions like diabetes, heart disease, and high blood pressure

Boost confidence and quality of life

For many patients, these aren’t just “weight loss aids”, they’re life-changing tools for better health.

Apple A Day Virtual Clinic’s Affordable Options

Even though TRICARE may no longer cover these medications, you still have options. At Apple A Day Virtual Clinic:

Virtual Consultations: Meet with a licensed provider from the comfort of your home

Affordable Weight Loss Medications: Access to a variety of options, tailored to your needs

Cost-Effective Care: We keep services affordable for patients paying out of pocket

Quick, Seamless Process: Easy appointment scheduling and prescription management

We understand the unique challenges military families face, and our goal is to make weight loss care accessible, flexible, and supportive no matter where you are.

Take the Next Step

If TRICARE’s policy changes have left you without access to your medication, don’t give up on your health goals.

(a) Establishment. The TRICARE program is established for the purpose of implementing a comprehensive managed health care program for the delivery and financing of health care services in the Military Health System. This was part of a 2017 act.

TFL is regulated under the old CHAMPUS rules and specifically prohibits weight control ANYTHING. I am pasting the paragraphs but again, look long enough in the link provided and you will see them. Bottom line is that we are likely to see change if and only if our pretty much worthless congress takes action to amend the regulations.

Regardless of the code justifying it, the DHA has now implemented a separate tier of treatment for us Tricare For Life beneficiaries. Note that there is nothing in the newsletter about how to help get this changed—only, sorry, but those are the rules!

Here is my cut and paste from the applicable CFR:

The Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) is the official legal print publication containing the codification of the general and permanent rules published in the Federal Register by the departments and agencies of the Federal Government. The Electronic Code of Federal Regulations (eCFR) is a continuously updated online version of the CFR. It is not an official legal edition of the CFR. Learn more about the eCFR, its status, and the editorial process.

CHAMPUS rules:

§ 199.4 Basic program benefits. (a) General. The CHAMPUS Basic Program is essentially a supplemental program to the Uniformed Services direct medical care system. The Basic Program is similar to private insurance programs, and is designed to provide financial assistance to CHAMPUS beneficiaries for certain prescribed medical care obtained from civilian sources.

(15) Morbid obesity. The TRICARE morbid obesity benefit is limited to those bariatric surgical procedures for which the safety and efficacy has been proven comparable or superior to conventional therapies and is consistent with the generally accepted norms for medical practice in the United States medical community. (See the definition of reliable evidence in § 199.2 of this part for the procedures used in determining if a medical treatment or procedure is unproven.) (i) Conditions for coverage. (A) Payment for bariatric surgical procedures is determined by the requirements specified in paragraph (g)(15) of this section, and as defined in § 199.2(b) of this part. (B) Covered bariatric surgical procedures are payable only when the patient has completed growth (18 years of age or documentation of completion of bone growth) and has met one of the following selection criteria: (1) The patient has a BMI that is equal to or exceeds 40 kg/m2 and has previously been unsuccessful with medical treatment for obesity. (2) The patient has a BMI of 35 to 39.9 kg/m2, has at least one high-risk co-morbid condition associated with morbid obesity, and has previously been unsuccessful with medical treatment for obesity. Note: The Director, TMA, shall issue guidelines for review of the specific high-risk co-morbid conditions, exacerbated or caused by obesity based on the Reliable Evidence Standard as defined in § 199.2 of this part. (ii) Treatment of complications. (A) Payment may be extended for repeat bariatric surgery when medically necessary to correct or treat complications from the initial covered bariatric surgery (a takedown). For instance, the surgeon in many cases will do a gastric bypass or gastroplasty to help the patient avoid regaining the weight that was lost. In this situation, payment is authorized even though the patient's condition technically may not meet the definition of morbid obesity because of the weight that was already lost following the initial surgery. (B) Payment is authorized for otherwise covered medical services and supplies directly related to complications of obesity when such services and supplies are an integral and necessary part of the course of treatment that was aggravated by the obesity.

(iii) Exclusions. CHAMPUS payment may not be extended for weight control services, weight control/loss programs, dietary regimens and supplements, appetite suppressants and other medications; food or food supplements, exercise and exercise programs, or other programs and equipment that are primarily intended to control weight or for the purpose of weight reduction, regardless of the existence of co-morbid conditions.

2017 Act: Tricare Prime and Select

§ 199.17 TRICARE program. (a) Establishment. The TRICARE program is established for the purpose of implementing a comprehensive managed health care program for the delivery and financing of health care services in the Military Health System. (1) Purpose. The TRICARE program implements a number of improvements primarily through modernized managed care support contracts that include special arrangements with civilian sector health care providers and better coordination between military medical treatment facilities (MTFs) and these civilian providers to deliver an integrated, health care delivery system that provides beneficiaries with access to high quality healthcare. Implementation of these improvements, to include enhanced access, improved health outcomes, increased efficiencies and elimination of waste, in addition to improving and maintaining operational medical force readiness, includes adoption of special rules and procedures not ordinarily followed under CHAMPUS or MTF requirements. This section establishes those special rules and procedures.

(3) Treatment of obesity. Under the authority of 10 U.S.C. 1097 and sections 706 and 729 of the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2017, notwithstanding 10 U.S.C. 1079(a)(10), treatment of obesity is covered under TRICARE Prime and TRICARE Select even if it is the sole or major condition treated. Such services must be provided by a TRICARE network provider and be medically necessary and appropriate in the context of the particular patient's treatment.

Q&A: TRICARE For Life Coverage of Weight Loss Medications By TRICARE Communications

FALLS CHURCH, Va. – The Defense Health Agency recently announced it will implement existing regulatory controls regarding TRICARE coverage of weight loss medications, including Glucagon-Like Peptide 1 (GLP-1) drugs, to ensure prescription processing aligns with federal coverage requirements. You may have questions, such as: Why do some plans cover these drugs while TRICARE For Life doesn’t? Should I stop taking my medication if TFL doesn’t cover it? Can I keep taking my prescription if I pay for it out of pocket? “Many TFL beneficiaries have concerns about why some obesity treatments are covered and others aren’t,” said Edward C. Norton, Chief, Pharmacy Operations Division at the Defense Health Agency. “TFL coverage of these drugs isn’t authorized when obesity is the sole or major condition treated. Our goal is to help you understand the existing rules and how to explore options that still meet your needs.” TFL offers Medicare wraparound coverage. It’s different from other TRICARE plan options, like TRICARE Prime or TRICARE Select.

Different laws govern TRICARE Prime and TRICARE Select. These laws allow the Department of Defense to offer certain additional preventive care services and health benefits when received from network providers under those plan options.

Q: Why does weight loss drug coverage differ between TFL and TRICARE Prime or TRICARE Select? A: Federal law and regulation determine the differences. Federal law doesn’t authorize TFL to cover weight loss medications when prescribed for weight loss as the sole or major condition. This is true regardless of the patient's age.

Other than bariatric surgery, which is authorized for the treatment of morbid obesity, federal regulation only extends coverage for treatment of obesity for beneficiaries with TRICARE Prime or TRICARE Select benefits when provided by network providers.

Q: Why doesn't TFL follow Medicare's exceptions for sleep apnea and heart disease conditions? A: TRICARE and Medicare operate under different legal frameworks with different coverage authorities. Medicare Part D may cover certain weight loss medications for non-obesity conditions. These may include sleep apnea or reducing cardiovascular risk. TFL follows separate federal laws and regulations. These laws and regulations exclude medications intended to control or reduce weight. This is regardless of the existence of co-morbid conditions.

Q: Why does this feel sudden? A: We understand this may feel abrupt. Express Scripts, the TRICARE Pharmacy Program contractor, mailed detailed notification letters to affected beneficiaries. These letters were mailed July 31, 2025 (30 days prior to the change). If you are affected, you shouldn’t stop taking your medication right away. Ask your provider what’s most appropriate during this transition period.

Q: Which prior authorizations became invalid on Aug. 31? A: Prior authorizations for obesity medications became invalid on Aug. 31 only for: Those with TFL Others not enrolled in TRICARE Prime, TRICARE Select, or premium-based plans (such as direct care only beneficiaries, foreign force members, or those with TRICARE Plus) Q: I’m a TFL beneficiary. What happens if I try to fill my prescription after Aug. 31? A: TRICARE will not cover your prescription. You can talk to your provider about other treatment options. Or you can prepare to pay for your prescription out of pocket. Q: I have TFL and diabetes. Are my GLP-1 drugs still covered? A: It depends. TRICARE covers certain GLP-1s for the treatment of type 2 diabetes. These include: Ozempic Trulicity Mounjaro Victoza Coverage continues for all patients with a diagnosis of diabetes when prior authorization criteria are met. This is true regardless of their health plan. Bottom line We know this may be difficult. We encourage you to work closely with your provider. They can help you find safe and effective approaches that support your long-term health and well-being.",,N,,2025-09-10 03:56:35.189816

Early last month, TRICARE announced that it will no longer cover obesity medications for retirees and for others who retain coverage care is restricted to in-network providers only.

For so many living with obesity, these medications are not optional. They are lifelines. They help manage a serious, chronic disease — just like insulin for diabetes or blood pressure medications for hypertension. Without them, many will face worsening health conditions like sleep apnea or heart disease, and the heartbreak of losing the progress they worked so hard to achieve.

This decision is more than unfair — it’s dangerous. It tells service members and their families, who sacrifice every single day, that their health doesn’t matter. It risks national security by making it harder for active-duty members to stay healthy and ready to serve.

Why This Change is Concerning

An estimated 27,000 people lost coverage for their obesity medications.

Those beneficiaries that have coverage must now receive care through in-network providers.

There are few TRICARE providers who are trained in obesity medicine.

Impacted beneficiaries were given less than 30 days to notice of the change, which is not adequate time to switch to a new provider.

People who finally found something that works are being forced to stop suddenly.

Service members’ health and readiness are being put at risk.

Obesity is being singled out, treated as “less than” other chronic diseases.

What You Can Do

We can’t stay silent. Congress needs to hear from the people this decision impacts most — you, your family, your story. Together, our voices can push TRICARE to reverse this harmful policy.

Take action today. Use our Advocacy Action Tool to send a message to your Members of Congress.

This is about fairness. It’s about health. It’s about honoring the sacrifices of military families who deserve the same chance at care and dignity as anyone else.",https://www.obesityaction.org/wp-content/themes/oac/assets/images/favicon.png,N,0.0,2025-09-10 07:56:11.389395

At my first job, no issues with credentialing or reimbursement, I had a handful of Tricare clients.
The pay was quite a lot better than my first salaried job, so the inconsistency of commissions didn’t bother me.
1) our clinic director states there is an issue with reimbursing folks who take Tricare insurance because of the Tricare redistricting.
2) our operations director sends out a “new” attestation form about our Tricare credentialing eligibility.","Hi all, long post ahead. TLDR: my old job made a gross mistake regarding Tricare credentialing and it’s costing me thousands, what do I do?

I am a mental healthcare provider licensed in MD. I have been credentialed with Tricare since I became a counselor 5 years ago. At my first job, no issues with credentialing or reimbursement, I had a handful of Tricare clients. I was salaried as well, so might have missed some things on the back end, but it never affected my pay and I never heard anything about needing to attest to my credentialing.

I got Job #2 in 2023, where I was also credentialed with insurances including Tricare. Job 2 took full responsibility of credentialing me, I never thought twice about it, and was informed that all fully-licensed providers were eligible for the same credentialing (slightly different process for provisionally licensed folks, per MD laws). My pay structure at this job was technically w-2, so I did receive PTO and subsidized healthcare, but I was paid a base hourly rate and received commission from my client revenue (insurance reimbursements and copays). The pay was quite a lot better than my first salaried job, so the inconsistency of commissions didn’t bother me.

I never actually saw my first Tricare client at Job 2 until end of January 2025. For whatever reason, I had a full caseload of non-Tricare clients until then. I proceeded to get 3-4 more over the course of the next few months (the last was referred to me in mid-June 2025). Over the course of January 2025-July 2025, I watched these clients’ insurance balances slowly climb- $800, $1,200, $2k, all the way until a couple of these folks were showing $4k+ balances that insurance hadn’t paid out. Because of my pay structure, I was missing A LOT of commission from these clients.

I had begun verbally prodding our clinic director and staff leader about this in our staff meetings back in about March or April, when the balances were hovering closer to $600-$1000 each, knowing that other clinicians at Job 2 were also taking Tricare clients (I learned not as many as me, most folks only had 1 or 2 and I had about 5). At the time the answer we got was, “reimbursement takes a while, we’ll take this to the owner and see what she can find out.”

Fast forward to July 2025, when all the shit hits the fan. 1) our clinic director states there is an issue with reimbursing folks who take Tricare insurance because of the Tricare redistricting. She recommends everyone cancel all Tricare appointments until further notice, and communicate to our clients that they should probably find a new provider. RED FREAKING FLAG. 2) our operations director sends out a “new” attestation form about our Tricare credentialing eligibility. One of the requirements for eligibility stipulated on this form is passing the National Counseling Exam (NCE) prior to 2017. I in fact passed this exam AFTER 2017. I fill out what I can and email our operations director back, asking what this means for my eligibility AND ALL the sessions I had completed up to this point. She says “we’re working to figure that out.”

In August, every staff meeting now has someone asking about Tricare eligibility and reimbursement. Every weekly catchup email has a bullet point about the Tricare debacle and how “we’re still working to figure this out.” It’s now been 7 months of “working to figure this out,” and I am sitting with literal thousands of dollars missing from my pay stubs. Between the lack of answers and then having to cancel 5 regular clients, not knowing if I would get them back, I was losing income fast. NOW the commission-based pay bothered me.

The last detail is, also in August, the clinic director informed us that when the redistricting of Tricare happened in January 2025, it changed their credentialing requirements. I immediately responded to this email asking what the company planned to do about reimbursing providers, seeing as it is their corporate team’s responsibility for accurately credentialing their providers, and the fact that I/we was/were not accurately credentialed is a grave oversight on their part. And the response I got was “that is precisely what we are trying to figure out.”

I applied for and accepted Job #3. I cannot work for a company that continues to be unaccountable for this gross error, whether the fault lies with my clinic director, operations director, owner, or corporate heads. However, not working for Job 2 anymore has made it vastly more difficult to keep them accountable, maintain updated communication, or make sure I’m getting paid correctly. My biggest concern is that I have completed work that I have not been paid for, based on a mistake that wasn’t mine, and I have heard zero promises that I will get paid the commission of thousands of dollars that are owed.

I am angry, but all I’m presenting is the facts. Do I file a complaint with DOL? Do I continue to harass Job 2 via email (I did email all professional correspondence to my personal email so I wouldn’t lose the information or the documentation of advocacy when I left)? Do I threaten to talk to a labor lawyer about missing wages?",,N,,2025-09-10 03:56:39.242276

Contact Information: Bragar Eagel & Squire, P.C.","NEW YORK, Sept. 09, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Bragar Eagel & Squire, P.C., a nationally recognized shareholder rights law firm, is investigating potential claims against Zynex, Inc. (NASDAQ:ZYXI) on behalf of long-term stockholders following a class action complaint that was filed against Zynex on July 9, 2025 with a Class Period from March 13, 2023, to the present. Our investigation concerns whether the board of directors of Zynex have breached their fiduciary duties to the company.

The complaint alleges that the Individual Defendants began artificially inflating Zynex’s stock price by issuing or allowing false and misleading statements about the Company’s financial performance, operational practices, and compliance with insurance reimbursement policies. These statements concealed a systemic “oversupplying scheme” whereby Zynex shipped excessive quantities of supplies, such as electrode pads and batteries, to patients, billing insurers for thousands of dollars more than necessary. Zynex’s undisclosed practices drew scrutiny from insurers, including Tricare (the federal health insurer for the military), which represented 20–25% of its annual revenue.

The full extent of Zynex’s misconduct was finally revealed on March 11, 2025, when the Company issued a press release announcing fourth-quarter and full-year 2024 results. The release disclosed a significant revenue “shortfall” due to “slower than normal payments from certain payers” and revealed, “Tricare has temporarily suspended payments as they review prior claims.” The March 11, 2025, press release admitted that Tricare, representing 20% to 25% of Zynex’s annual revenue, was scrutinizing prior claims, threatening the Company’s financial stability.

The next day, on March 12, 2025, Zynex’s stock price plummeted $3.59 per share, or 51.3%, closing at $3.41 per share. This catastrophic decline wiped out significant shareholder value, reflecting the market’s reaction to Zynex’s exposure to regulatory and financial risks concealed by the Individual Defendants.

Dr. Elizabeth Seymour agreed to pay $234,215 to resolve allegations that she also received payments from purported MSOs to order lab tests from True Health and other labs.
Lastly, seven marketers and their entities agreed to pay $1.5 million to resolve allegations that they paid kickbacks disguised as MSO payments to doctors to induce laboratory testing.
These include several True Health, other lab, and marketing firm employees.
“We will continue to pursue those who steal from federal healthcare programs through these types of schemes to pay improper kickbacks to providers.”","After being indicted in 2022, True Health Diagnostics CEO Christopher Grottenthaler and others have agreed to settle the federal allegations that the company made kickback arrangements with marketers and physicians and made fraudulent claims for laboratory testing against federal payers Medicare, Medicaid, and TRICARE.

In a case that began in California with a whistleblower complaint, prosecutors alleged that Grottenthaler agreed to a kickback scheme in which marketers and True Health employees offered and paid doctors kickbacks disguised as management service organization distributions to boost referrals to the True Health lab. At other times, prosecutors allege that Grottenthaler arranged for True Health to pay kickbacks disguised as consulting fees, processing and handling fees, and waivers of copayments and deductibles to bring in more referrals, many of which were unnecessary lab panels. The settlement resolves these allegations after Grottenthaler pleaded guilty to conspiracy to commit illegal remuneration.

The original 125-page complaint, dated 2016, describes how True Health would promise doctors that it would not charge patients copayments or deductibles, helping physicians retain patients while the lab collected insurance payments without charging the patient directly. It also alleges the defendants created a “Speakers Bureau” and advisory panels where they paid physicians in exchange for the physicians referring lab work to them and sent out some lab work to other labs while billing insurance as if they had done the job.

Evidence in the case showed that Grottenthaler continued the alleged scheme even after receiving warnings from colleagues that the marketers the lab worked with “are a powder keg waiting to explode on us” and that “people are gonna go to prison.”

An email exhibit from a physician who worked with an entity acquired by True Health, which was included in the complaint, describes how the lab would not charge patients for lab results, which is illegal. “It is absolutely back to business as usual!!” it reads. “As much as I thought this would happen, a part of me really couldn’t believe they would have the gall to just resume the same behaviors!!”

The complaint also details how Grottenthaler has been connected to healthcare fraud before. As the VP of Finance at Ameritox, the Department of Health and Human Services accused the company of paying kickbacks to encourage physicians to refer drug testing services to the lab, and in 2010, Ameritox paid $16.3 million to settle the case.

Another recently announced settlement resolved allegations against Dr. Hong Davis of Denton, who agreed to pay $124,627 to resolve allegations that she received thousands in payments between 2015 and 2017 from purported MSOs in return for ordering laboratory tests from labs in Rockdale, Texas, and Framingham, Massachusetts. Dr. Elizabeth Seymour agreed to pay $234,215 to resolve allegations that she also received payments from purported MSOs to order lab tests from True Health and other labs.

Lastly, seven marketers and their entities agreed to pay $1.5 million to resolve allegations that they paid kickbacks disguised as MSO payments to doctors to induce laboratory testing. These include several True Health, other lab, and marketing firm employees.

“These settlements reflect the firm commitment of the Eastern District of Texas to punish those who use fraudulent means to profit at the expense of federal healthcare programs funded by the hard-working taxpayers of the United States,” said Acting U.S. Attorney Jay R. Combs for the Eastern District of Texas. “We will continue to pursue those who steal from federal healthcare programs through these types of schemes to pay improper kickbacks to providers.”",https://assets.dmagstatic.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/iStock-1300036735.jpg,N,0.0,2025-09-09 17:56:22.409439

“We play a combat support role at AFHSD, and we are responsible for protecting the Joint Force,” said Navy Capt. Richard Langton, chief of AFHSD. “We carry out our assigned duties through retrospective, near real-time, and prospective health surveillance — in a nutshell, full-spectrum health surveillance.”

AFHSD is a public health component of the DHA and the U.S. military’s central public health entity. The division focuses on global health surveillance, providing operational forces with early warning, health threat assessments, and force-readiness data.

The division is organized into three branches: Epidemiology and Analysis, Global Emerging Infections Surveillance, and Integrated Biosurveillance.

AFHSD is the central repository of medical surveillance data for the armed forces. This is done through technical infrastructure, expertise in database management for the Defense Medical Surveillance System and related applications, and operations, and management of the Department of Defense Serum Repository.

The DMSS houses current and historical data on diseases and medical events. These include hospitalizations, ambulatory visits, reportable medical events, laboratory tests, immunizations, periodic and deployment-related health assessments, and casualty data affecting service members throughout their military careers. It contains billions of data records on service members and other Military Health System beneficiaries.

Leveraging data to manage seasonal respiratory illnesses

The AFHSD uses this wealth of data to analyze and anticipate potential threats.

“AFHSD plays a key role in integrating biosurveillance efforts by collecting data and information in near real-time of the threats from endemic diseases and emerging infectious diseases relevant to the military worldwide,” said Juan I. Ubiera, chief of the IB branch. “IB also conducts forecasting analytics to predict and communicate seasonal respiratory illnesses threats.”

This surveillance information enables weekly trend analysis and situation reports on seasonal respiratory illnesses. It also includes a report on respiratory illness activity on and around selected installations, to assist senior leaders in making decisions regarding resource and personnel distribution.

IB also supports early warnings and monitoring of various syndromes, including respiratory illnesses at military hospitals and clinics, communicated through the Electronic Surveillance System for the Early Notification of Community Based Epidemics, or ESSENCE. This program, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, allows public health professionals to analyze events of public health interest, monitor health care data for events that could affect public health, and share data and analyses.

Raising awareness with the Medical Surveillance Monthly Report

The AFHSD disseminates important biosurveillance information through a peer-reviewed journal, the Medical Surveillance Monthly Report.

“The MSMR publishes summaries of notifiable diseases, trends of illnesses of special interest, and field reports describing outbreaks and case occurrences,” said Shauna Stahlman, senior epidemiologist in the E&A branch.

“Launched in 1995, the journal provides evidence-based estimates of the incidence, distribution, impact, and trends of illness and injuries among U.S. military service members and associated populations,” she said.

According to Stahlman, the MSMR publishes “pertinent articles on military public health, epidemiology, surveillance, and disease and injury prevention, continuously evaluating manuscript submissions for scientific accuracy.”

“The journal reports present data, public health information, and original research with direct relevance to the operational fitness of military members or MHS beneficiaries’ health, safety, and well-being,” she added.

Future of biosurveillance

Each branch has specific goals in their continuing efforts to meet the needs of service members and other MHS beneficiaries.

“The E&A branch’s goal is to be flexible, responsive, and predictive to our customers by releasing accurate, timely, and actionable surveillance data, and leveraging partnerships and networks within and outside of DHA public health to better predict and respond to their needs,” said Stahlman.

“In addition, we also aim to reduce the spread of medical misinformation and disinformation, which were identified as potential vulnerabilities for biodefense in the 2023 Biodefense Posture Review,” she noted.

The GEIS branch is expanding capabilities for pathogen-agnostic genomic sequencing, a method for detecting unknown pathogens to determine the cause of an illness, and wastewater surveillance, said June Early, deputy chief of the GEIS branch. “The future development, implementation, and expansion of these capabilities will enable a more comprehensive understanding of infectious disease threats.”

“Also, our respiratory infections focus area oversees the coordination of the DOD global influenza vaccine effectiveness analysis,” said Early. “These analyses directly inform selection and composition of the following season’s northern hemisphere influenza vaccine.”

The IB branch is enhancing biosurveillance early warning content and information dissemination on the Health Surveillance Explorer, the DHA’s mapping application that provides near real-time integrated global health surveillance information for force health protection.

“We are increasing syndromic surveillance capabilities through collaborative partnerships with additional states,” said Ubiera. “IB is working with combatant commands and services to provide tailored biosurveillance information. We are also working to expand global biosurveillance capabilities by working with partner nations and allies to exchange information. This is one of the reform initiatives established in the 2023 Biodefense Posture Review.”

Capturing the high ground in health surveillance

Military public health surveillance is vital in detecting and mitigating emerging health threats, Langton said.

“We’re very proud of the capabilities we already bring to the fight. But future success requires us to move beyond the current state,” he said. “The task before us is to capture the high ground in health surveillance. We are meeting that head-on by adopting new capabilities and tapping into the unique capabilities of our partners to create synergies that endure and allow us to dominate the health surveillance space.”",https://www.militaryspot.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/fighting-disease.png,N,0.0,2025-09-09 17:56:29.933357

“Everywhere I go in Hampton Roads, I hear from military families about the challenges they face with healthcare, frequent moves, and the cost of living,” said Congresswoman Kiggans.
Two of Kiggans’ top priorities this year focus on fixing TRICARE to better serve military families.
Kiggans has also advanced amendments to ease the everyday burdens of military life.

“Everywhere I go in Hampton Roads, I hear from military families about the challenges they face with healthcare, frequent moves, and the cost of living,” said Congresswoman Kiggans. “My focus in this year’s NDAA is to tackle those challenges head-on and make sure our servicemembers and their loved ones get the support they deserve.”

Building on that commitment, Kiggans put forward a package of reforms that directly respond to the concerns she hears most often from military families, from healthcare access to stable housing and community support.

Two of Kiggans’ top priorities this year focus on fixing TRICARE to better serve military families. One proposal would align TRICARE with private-sector health plans by extending dependent coverage until age 26 and eliminating the costly separate premium under the TRICARE Young Adult program. Another would strengthen the TRICARE Pharmacy Benefits Program by ensuring fair reimbursement for local pharmacies, banning hidden fees, mandating independent audits, and protecting patient choice. Together, these reforms would make healthcare more affordable, transparent, and reliable for servicemembers, retirees, and their families.

Kiggans has also advanced amendments to ease the everyday burdens of military life. She is pressing the Department of Defense to evaluate how reducing permanent change of station (PCS) moves and Navy sea/shore rotations could improve family stability, while also reviewing whether PCS reimbursements truly cover out-of-pocket costs. To improve housing and healthcare, she has supported new standards to address mold in military housing, pushed for a digital system that lets TRICARE beneficiaries track access-to-care issues, and required DoD to give families timely notice of coverage changes. In addition, she has secured language to dedicate a portion of Defense Community Infrastructure Pilot (DCIP) funding to projects that directly benefit military families, such as schools, childcare, and community facilities.

“As a Navy veteran, spouse to a veteran, and military Mom, I know firsthand how much our servicemembers and their families sacrifice for our country. Our servicemembers should be focused on the mission, not worrying about whether their families can afford healthcare or live in safe housing. These amendments are about giving them the peace of mind they deserve,” Kiggans added. “Even if Washington politics prevents some of these proposals from moving forward, I want military families to know I will never stop fighting to make their lives easier and ensure they receive the care and respect they deserve.”

“Millions of Americans rely on premium tax credits to keep their health coverage,” said Congressman Kean.“Since 2021, these credits have helped rideshare drivers, working families, and many others afford private insurance on the individual market. If they expire at the end of the year, families in New Jersey and across the country will face higher costs and risk losing critical coverage. This bipartisan effort will extend the credits for another year as Congress continues working together on long-term solutions to lower health care premiums.”

Representing a district that includes Naval Air Station Oceana, Joint Expeditionary Base Little Creek–Fort Story, and the largest concentration of military families in the nation, Congresswoman Kiggans has made it her mission on the House Armed Services Committee to strengthen the Navy, support shipyard workers, and champion policies that improve military quality of life.

Under the new directive, military clinics and hospitals are prohibited from providing continuing care to transgender adolescent and adult children.

Lambda Legal and the Legal Defense Fund issued a letter on Tuesday urging U.S. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth to reverse course on a policy that led to the removal of 381 books from the Nimitz Library of the U.S.","Three military families sued the Department of Defense on Monday after President Trump’s anti-transgender policies barred their transgender adolescent and adult children from accessing essential gender-affirming medical care.

The lawsuit, filed in the U.S. District Court for the District of Maryland, challenges the legality of the Trump administration’s decision to ban coverage of any transgender-related medical care under Department of Defense health insurance plans.

Under the new directive, military clinics and hospitals are prohibited from providing continuing care to transgender adolescent and adult children. It also prevents TRICARE, the military’s health insurance program, from covering the costs of gender-affirming care for both transgender youth and young adults, regardless of where that care is received.

A press release from the families’ attorney explained that the plaintiffs are proceeding under pseudonyms to protect their safety and privacy. They are represented by GLBTQ Legal Advocates & Defenders (GLAD Law), the National Center for Lesbian Rights (NCLR), Brown, Goldstein & Levy, LLP, and Keker, Van Nest & Peters LLP.

“This is a sweeping reversal of military health policy and a betrayal of military families who have sacrificed for our country,” said Sarah Austin, Staff Attorney at GLAD Law. “When a servicemember is deployed and focused on the mission they deserve to know their family is taken care of. This Administration has backtracked on that core promise and put servicemembers at risk of losing access to health care their children desperately need.”

“President Trump has illegally overstepped his authority by abruptly cutting off necessary medical care for military families,” said Shannon Minter, Legal Director at NCLR. “This lawless directive is part of a dangerous pattern of this administration ignoring legal requirements and abandoning our servicemembers.”

“President Trump’s Executive Order blocks military hospitals from giving transgender youth the care their doctors deem necessary and their parents have approved,” said Sharif Jacob, partner at Keker, Van Nest & Peters LLP. “Today we filed a lawsuit to put an end to his order, and the agency guidance implementing it.”

“This administration is unlawfully targeting military families by denying essential care to their transgender children,” said Liam Brown, an associate with Keker, Van Nest & Peters. “We will not stand by while those who serve are stripped of the ability to care for their families.”

The U.S. Air Force on Thursday said transgender service members who have served between 15 and 18 years would be denied the opportunity to retire early and instead will be separated from the military without benefits.

Trans troops will now have the option of accepting a lump sum payout offered to junior service members or be removed from the service.

A spokesperson for the Air Force told the Associated Press that “although service members with 15 to 18 years of honorable service were permitted to apply for an exception to policy, none of the exceptions to policy were approved.”

Some trans airmen, about a dozen, were “prematurely notified” that they were able to retire early before the decision was reversed, the spokesperson said.

Responding to the news, Human Rights Campaign Chief of Staff Jay Brown said, “This is indefensible. After already denying transgender servicemembers the ability to serve their country, the Trump administration is now stripping them of the retirement benefits they’ve earned after years of honorable service.”

Brown continued, “This has nothing to do with military readiness — it’s cruelty for cruelty’s sake.”

HRC and Lambda Legal are representing plaintiffs in a lawsuit, Shilling v. United States, challenging the Trump-Vance administration’s ban on military service by trans people.

Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth has ordered the renaming of the U.S. Naval Ship Harvey Milk, according to a report in Military.com on Tuesday.

Since 2016, the replenishment oiler has borne the name of the late gay rights icon, who served in the Navy during the Korean War, was separated from the service other than honorably to avoid being court martialed for his homosexuality, and then went on to become the the first LGBTQ candidate elected to public office in California.

Per the article, a memorandum from the Office of the Secretary of the Navy outlined the plans to rename the ship, and a defense official said the order to take this “rare step” came from Hegseth with an announcement deliberately planned for Pride month, on June 13.

The memo reviewed by Military.com indicates that the move comes as part of an effort to strengthen “alignment with president and SECDEF objectives and SECNAV priorities of reestablishing the warrior culture.”

Milk was assassinated in 1978 while serving on the San Francisco Board of Supervisors. U.S. House Speaker Emerita Nancy Pelosi (D), who has represented the city in Congress since 1987, said the decision is “a surrender of a fundamental American value: to honor the legacy of those who worked to build a better country” and “a shameful, vindictive erasure of those who fought to break down barriers for all to chase the American Dream.”

“Our military is the most powerful in the world — but this spiteful move does not strengthen our national security or the ‘warrior’ ethos,” she said.

Renaming a Naval ship is traditionally considered taboo, as well as a harbinger of bad luck.

During the Biden-Harris administration in 2023, however, a cruiser and research ship with names tied to the Confederacy were renamed — though Military.com notes that “the recommendation to rename the two ships came from a commission that was created by Congress to study names with ties to the Confederacy across the entire military.”

CBS on Tuesday reported that along with the Harvey Milk, the Navy is also considering renaming other John Lewis-class oilers including the USNS Thurgood Marshall, USNS Ruth Bader Ginsburg, and USNS Harriet Tubman.

Lambda Legal and the Legal Defense Fund issued a letter on Tuesday urging U.S. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth to reverse course on a policy that led to the removal of 381 books from the Nimitz Library of the U.S. Naval Academy in Annapolis, Md.

Pursuant to President Donald Trump’s executive order 14190, “Ending Radical Indoctrination in K-12 Schooling,” the institution screened 900 titles to identify works promoting “diversity, equity, and inclusion,” removing those that concerned or touched upon “topics pertaining to the experiences of people of color, especially Black people, and/or LGBTQ people,” according to a press release from the civil rights organizations.

These included “I Know Why the Caged Bird Sings” by Maya Angelou, “Stone Fruit” by Lee Lai, “The Hate U Give” by Angie Thomas, “Lies My Teacher Told Me: Everything Your American History Textbook Got Wrong” by James W. Loewen, “Gender Queer: A Memoir” by Maia Kobabe, and “Democracy in Black: How Race Still Enslaves the American Soul” by Eddie S. Glaude, Jr.

The groups further noted that “the collection retained other books with messages and themes that privilege certain races and religions over others, including ‘The Clansman: A Historical Romance of the Ku Klux Klan’ by Thomas Dixon, Jr., ‘Mein Kampf’ by Adolf Hitler, and ‘Heart of Darkness’ by Joseph Conrad.

In their letter, Lambda Legal and LDF argued the books must be returned to circulation to preserve the “constitutional rights” of cadets at the institution, warning of the “danger” that comes with “censoring materials based on viewpoints disfavored by the current administration.”

“Such censorship is especially dangerous in an educational setting, where critical inquiry, intellectual diversity, and exposure to a wide array of perspectives are necessary to educate future citizen-leaders,” Lambda Legal Chief Legal Officer Jennifer C.

In February, Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth implemented a rule prohibiting transgender service members from receiving gender-affirming care and barring new enlistments of those with a history of gender dysphoria. A federal court temporarily blocked the rule in April, finding the restrictions unconstitutional. Despite this ruling, Assistant Secretary of Defense for Health Affairs Dr. Stephen Ferrara chose in May to enforce the policy.

The three families that are challenging the Pentagon are arguing that the administration’s actions exceed the scope of last year’s law, which bars TRICARE from covering “medical interventions for the treatment of gender dysphoria that could result in sterilization.” The lawsuit also contends that Trump’s executive order and the Pentagon’s enforcement, which restrict care for all dependents, violate a separate statute prohibiting federal regulations from being “arbitrary and capricious.”

According to the lawsuit, two of the children—identified as Diana Doe and Nathan Noe—had been receiving hormone therapy with their parents’ consent, based on guidance from doctors at Walter Reed National Military Medical Center in Maryland. This spring, their doctors informed the families that the medical center could no longer provide the therapy, and TRICARE sent no notice of the coverage change.

The third plaintiff, Parker Poe, a young adult, has been unable to continue treatment after his doctor at an unnamed facility told the family that TRICARE would no longer cover his testosterone or related care.

The lawsuit asks a federal judge ""to hold unlawful and set aside"" the new policies under the Administrative Procedure Act (APA), the statute governing the behavior of agencies and departments.

The plaintiffs say the new rules issued by the DoD have forced their families – and very likely others in their position – into a financially precarious position and risked their overall health.

""Their prescriptions have been cut off without notice,"" the lawsuit reads. ""Their trusted doctors at military hospitals have been forced to abandon them. Plaintiffs' families now face significant, and in some cases crushing, out-of-pocket costs or the prospect of watching their family member's health deteriorate without the medications that kept them healthy and stable. This is not an abstract policy shift—it is an immediate and devastating disruption of essential healthcare that affects the physical and psychological wellbeing of Plaintiffs and other young people throughout the country.""

The plaintiffs say they have relied on TRICARE providing gender-affirming care for ""nearly a decade."" Such services were provided by both military medical treatment facilities and military pharmacies, the lawsuit says – and outlined in TRICARE's own policy manual.

""Consistent with this scientific evidence and accepted medical standards, TRICARE has covered puberty-blocking medications and hormone therapy when indicated for transgender adolescents, and hormone therapy when indicated for transgender adults,"" the filing goes on.

The abrupt about-face to stop providing ""medically necessary medications"" is part of a ""targeted reversal"" to ""strip equal rights from transgender people"" and reflects the 45th and 47th president's ""hostile views toward transgender people,"" the lawsuit alleges.

The lawsuit says these changes have collectively ""unlawfully modified the scope of medical care provided"" to military families.

And these changes, the complaint explains, fly in the face of generally-accepted medical practice – even where minors are concerned.

""Under accepted protocols, physicians do not prescribe puberty-blocking medications or hormones to adolescent minors unless they have obtained informed consent from a parent and assent from the minor,"" the filing continues. ""Physicians must disclose the known risks and benefits of each medication to obtain informed parental consent and minor assent.""

The lawsuit takes a highly personalized approach by explaining each of the plaintiffs' own struggles with gender dysphoria as a child.

One representative section reads, at length:

As early as elementary school, Nathan felt uncomfortable being seen as a girl. Even before he had language to explain it and before he could tell others, he identified as a boy and did what he could to live that way…

As he grew, Nathan had multiple conversations with his parents about not feeling like or being a girl and wanting to be a boy. Nathan's parents increasingly became aware of the distress Nathan experienced when others did not treat him as a boy. As Nathan approached puberty and his distress over not being recognized and treated as a boy intensified, his parents sought medical advice from a healthcare provider.

The lawsuit was filed in Maryland district court by attorneys with GLBTQ Legal Advocates and Defenders (GLAD) and the National Center for LGBTQ Rights. The case has been assigned to U.S. District Judge Deborah L. Boardman, a Joe Biden appointee.

""This is a sweeping reversal of military health policy and a betrayal of military families who have sacrificed for our country,"" GLAD said in a press release announcing the litigation. ""When a servicemember is deployed, they deserve to know their family is taken care of.""

In legal terms, the plaintiffs say the DoD ""failed to offer any explanation at all"" in support for the change in policy and similarly did not consider ""all relevant factors"" when making the shift. Short-circuiting the process in this manner amounts to an action considered ""arbitrary and capricious"" under the APA, the lawsuit alleges.

In another challenge, the plaintiffs say any changes to TRICARE coverage require a formal announcement under the notice-and-comment rulemaking standard outlined in the APA – as well as similar rules outlined in two additional statutes relevant to government-provided health insurance. And, as a result, since no such notice was provided here, the government failed to comply with the ""procedures required for all new substantive rules, and thus impermissibly promulgated a new rule in violation of the APA,"" the lawsuit says.

The lawsuit also challenges the Trump administration's effort to stop providing gender-affirming care for certain adults – who are 18 or 19 years old – as a direct violation of an appropriations bill passed by Congress.

""The Executive Branch cannot usurp Congress's legislative authority on its own mandate; any legislative authority wielded by the Executive Branch must have been delegated within the confines of the Constitutional limitations protecting the respective spheres of government,"" the complaint continues. ""The Executive Branch has no constitutional power to enact, amend, or repeal parts of duly enacted statutes.""",https://lawandcrime.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Trump-military-parade.jpg,N,0.0,2025-09-09 15:56:09.752961

If you used the West Region referral approval waiver to see a specialist between Jan. 1 and June 30, 2025 and need to continue seeing that specialist, you’ll need to get a new referral to a network specialist before Oct. 1, 2025.

If you’re still using a valid referral issued by a previous contractor before Jan. 1, 2025, you also need to get a new referral for any care received starting Oct. 1. You can confirm your referral information by logging into the TRICARE West Region Beneficiary Portal. (Note: If your referral expires before Oct. 1, it’s valid through its expiration date.) Otherwise, you may need to pay point-of-service fees.

“If you live in the West Region, it’s important that you take the time now to evaluate your current referrals,” said Jacob Sanchez, referral management subject expert, TRICARE Health Plan, at the Defense Health Agency. “Work with your primary care manager and plan ahead for specialty care you may need starting Oct. 1.”

“TFL coverage of these drugs isn’t authorized when obesity is the sole or major condition treated.
Q: Why does weight loss drug coverage differ between TFL and TRICARE Prime or TRICARE Select?
Federal law doesn’t authorize TFL to cover weight loss medications when prescribed for weight loss as the sole or major condition.
Medicare Part D may cover certain weight loss medications for non-obesity conditions.","The Defense Health Agency recently announced it will implement existing regulatory controls regarding TRICARE coverage of weight loss medications, including Glucagon-Like Peptide 1 (GLP-1) drugs, to ensure prescription processing aligns with federal coverage requirements. You may have questions, such as:

• Why do some plans cover these drugs while TRICARE For Life doesn’t?

• Should I stop taking my medication if TFL doesn’t cover it?

• Can I keep taking my prescription if I pay for it out of pocket?

“Many TFL beneficiaries have concerns about why some obesity treatments are covered and others aren’t,” said Edward C. Norton, Chief, Pharmacy Operations Division at the Defense Health Agency. “TFL coverage of these drugs isn’t authorized when obesity is the sole or major condition treated. Our goal is to help you understand the existing rules and how to explore options that still meet your needs.”

TFL offers Medicare wraparound coverage. It’s different from other TRICARE plan options, like TRICARE Prime or TRICARE Select.

Different laws govern TRICARE Prime and TRICARE Select. These laws allow the Department of Defense to offer certain additional preventive care services and health benefits when received from network providers under those plan options.

Q: Why does weight loss drug coverage differ between TFL and TRICARE Prime or TRICARE Select?

A: Federal law and regulation determine the differences.

Federal law doesn’t authorize TFL to cover weight loss medications when prescribed for weight loss as the sole or major condition. This is true regardless of the patient's age.

Other than bariatric surgery, which is authorized for the treatment of morbid obesity, federal regulation only extends coverage for treatment of obesity for beneficiaries with TRICARE Prime or TRICARE Select benefits when provided by network providers.

Q: Why doesn't TFL follow Medicare's exceptions for sleep apnea and heart disease conditions?

A: TRICARE and Medicare operate under different legal frameworks with different coverage authorities. Medicare Part D may cover certain weight loss medications for non-obesity conditions. These may include sleep apnea or reducing cardiovascular risk.

TFL follows separate federal laws and regulations. These laws and regulations exclude medications intended to control or reduce weight. This is regardless of the existence of co-morbid conditions.

Q: Why does this feel sudden?

A: We understand this may feel abrupt. Express Scripts, the TRICARE Pharmacy Program contractor, mailed detailed notification letters to affected beneficiaries. These letters were mailed July 31, 2025 (30 days prior to the change).

If you are affected, you shouldn’t stop taking your medication right away. Ask your provider what’s most appropriate during this transition period.

Q: Which prior authorizations became invalid on Aug. 31?

A: Prior authorizations for obesity medications became invalid on Aug. 31 only for:

• Those with TFL

• Others not enrolled in TRICARE Prime, TRICARE Select, or premium-based plans (such as direct care only beneficiaries, foreign force members, or those with TRICARE Plus)

Q: I’m a TFL beneficiary. What happens if I try to fill my prescription after Aug. 31?

A: TRICARE will not cover your prescription. You can talk to your provider about other treatment options. Or you can prepare to pay for your prescription out of pocket.

Q: I have TFL and diabetes. Are my GLP-1 drugs still covered?

A: It depends. TRICARE covers certain GLP-1s for the treatment of type 2 diabetes. These include:

• Ozempic

• Trulicity

• Mounjaro

• Victoza

Coverage continues for all patients with a diagnosis of diabetes when prior authorization criteria are met. This is true regardless of their health plan.

We know this may be difficult. We encourage you to work closely with your provider.

“By partnering with Cactus, we’re combining behavioural health science with creative storytelling to break down stigma and open new pathways to care,” says Dishi Umfleet - executive director. “This campaign is about meeting military communities where they are and making support visible, accessible, and judgment-free.”

'Stigma Stand Down' addresses a critical need, as military personnel often face significant barriers to care due to the stigma associated with looking weak or unmanly when seeking help. The core creative visualises this internal struggle with the tagline, ""When you have a gambling problem, it shows up everywhere.""

The visuals, created with a combination of AI and human manipulation, depict how gambling invades ordinary life scenarios like family dinners, a trip to the grocery store, or even attending a little league baseball game, prompting the audience to confront the issue head-on.

“Our work on Stigma Stand Down was informed by two things: our agency’s commitment to promoting mental health, and the Responsible Gaming initiatives we oversee for our three state lottery clients in Colorado, North Carolina and Indiana,” said Cactus founder and CEO, Joe Conrad. “Problem gambling never exists in a vacuum and with the Stigma Stand Down campaign we wanted to send the message that there are a number of steps you can take to address problem gambling or other mental health issues in a non-judgemental, helpful, and confidential way.”

The new campaign aims to provide a judgment-free zone for support, offering resources like TRICARE-covered telehealth and evidence-based tools.

For paying the ultimate sacrifice, Evans was the first Vietnam War medic to receive the medal posthumously. He was 23 and married.

Nearly 20 years later in 1986, Evans Army Community Hospital on Fort Carson, Colorado, honored his sacrifice and gave his name to the original Fort Carson hospital complex built in 1942. Today, EACH honors Evans’ memory by earning superior ratings for its patient- and family-centered healthcare services.

A young medic in Vietnam

Evans enlisted in the Army in 1965 after graduating high school in Covina, California, where he excelled as a cross-country runner. Evans completed his medic training with Company D, 1st Battalion, at the U.S. Army Medical Training Center on Fort Sam Houston, graduating in June 1966 and deploying shortly after.

Excerpts from Evans’ personal journal and photos, provided by the U.S. Army Medical Department, show the challenging conditions the young medic and his platoon faced while serving in Vietnam:

Oct.14, 1966: “When the convoy was lined up, they gave us ammo. I carry morphine, so you know we’re here.”

Nov. 11, 1966: “I’m sitting alongside a Pup tent that’s about as dry as dry during a rain as the ocean. We live half like animals and half like people. During the last 10 days, I’ve slept in the wet.”

Dec. 10-22, 1966: “I got another metal [sic] for my collections. It’s a … Combat Medics Badge. You get it for being in a combat area for more than 30 days or being in hostile fire twice.”

Evans’ day of sacrifice

According to his Medal of Honor citation, during a firefight near the hamlet of Tri Tam, Binh Duong Province, Evans left his position of relative safety with his platoon to answer the calls for medical aid from the wounded men of another platoon which was heavily engaged with the enemy force. The hamlet was located north of the infamous and heavily occupied Iron Triangle.

After bringing the wounded to safety, Evans returned to the forward location to treat more causalities and was struck and seriously injured by hand grenade fragments. He continued to evacuate other wounded soldiers, was severely wounded again, and rejoined his platoon. The citation goes on: “Continuing to refuse medical attention and ignoring advice to remain behind, he managed with his waning strength to move yet another wounded comrade across the dangerous open area to safety.”

“Disregarding his painful wounds and seriously weakened from profuse bleeding, he continued his lifesaving medical aid and was killed while treating another wounded comrade,” according to his citation.

Thanks largely to Evans’ bravery in his rescue efforts that day while severely wounded, only three soldiers died in the firefight; Evans was one of them.

EACH quality honors ‘Doc’ Evans every day

Evans Army Community Hospital’s commitment to keeping Evans’ memory alive has resulted in a significant number of quality awards, including:

“A” Safety Grades for the last four years from the independent watchdog The Leapfrog Group. You can find ratings for keeping patients safe from errors, injuries, accidents, and infections for all military hospitals and clinics in the list of current quality, patient safety, and access information.

A meritorious recognition from the American College of Surgeons’ National Surgical Quality Improvement Program. The NSQI is a variable-based data registry reflecting high standards in surgical care.

A triennial survey by the certification body, The Joint Commission, in February 2025 recognized EACH for a staff culture of engagement in patient safety.

A Greenhealth Partner for Change award in 2025 from the nation’s leading organization dedicated to environmental sustainability in health care.

The Fort Sam Houston Evans Auditorium on Joint Base San Antonio, Texas, honored Evans in June 1972. Many Army medics trained at JBSA receive their graduation certificates at the auditorium.

‘One of the good guys’

During the 1972 dedication, several of Evans’ combat buddies spoke about him. Al Peckham and Bill Comeau called Evans “one of the good guys,” according to ceremony materials in the U.S. Army Medical Department historical collection.

They noted: “These [photos] are the details that Don wanted you to know about, showing the exotic locale where he served so gallantly. Today many of the men ... survived their tour in Vietnam because of Donald's heroic deeds while administering to them that day in January 1967. They never forgot him.”

The USNS Cody is one of a class of Navy vessels designed to provide high-speed, rapid transport of troops, equipment, and supplies.
The vessel is capable of operating in littoral, or coastal, regions with a hybrid crew of non-military and U.S. Navy medical providers.
While deployed in expeditionary environments, EMUs provide critical patient holding, patient movement, and prolonged field care, tailored to the specific mission requirements of U.S. Navy theater commands.
We are committed to supporting our partners in the U.S. Navy and Marine Corps in their mission of maintaining regional stability across the Indo-Pacific.”","Team members with the Defense Health Agency’s Operational Medical Systems Program Management Office (OPMED) got an up-close preview of the U.S. Navy’s latest expeditionary fast transport recently during a tour hosted by the Military Sealift Command (MSC) at Joint Expeditionary Base Little Creek-Fort Story, Virginia, Aug. 28, 2025.

Visiting the Spearhead-class Expeditionary Fast Transport USNS Cody (T-EPF 14) gave the OPMED team an opportunity to engage with joint service and Navy stakeholders to plan for future direct support of U.S. Navy expeditionary medical capabilities. The USNS Cody is one of a class of Navy vessels designed to provide high-speed, rapid transport of troops, equipment, and supplies.

The tour, which highlighted progress on ship retrofitting for the future embarkation of the U.S. Navy's Expeditionary Medical Unit (EMU) 1 aboard the USNS Cody, included service members and civilians from OPMED; the Expeditionary Missions Program Office within the Naval Sea Systems Command; U.S. Navy Bureau of Medicine and Surgery; Naval Medical Forces Atlantic; and Naval Systems Engineering and Logistics Directorate. All are key stakeholders in the EMU program’s development.

According to MSC experts, the USNS Cody is being developed as a Role 2 facility – equipped to provide medical treatment, advanced trauma management, emergency surgery, and resuscitative care while afloat. The vessel is capable of operating in littoral, or coastal, regions with a hybrid crew of non-military and U.S. Navy medical providers. While deployed in expeditionary environments, EMUs provide critical patient holding, patient movement, and prolonged field care, tailored to the specific mission requirements of U.S. Navy theater commands.

The United States Indo-Pacific Command, or USINDOPACOM, is the unified combatant command responsible for the Indo-Pacific region, which covers more than 50% of the earth’s surface. Given the operational and strategic interest of the USINDOPACOM area of responsibility, the OPMED team is exploring new and future opportunities to support military medical providers in this vital region, according to U.S. Army Col. Owen L. Roberts, OPMED’s program manager.

“As the primary advanced medical developer for the joint service, we develop, acquire, field, and sustain medical technologies across program lifecycles,” said Roberts. “OPMED’s mission is to enhance Warfighter lethality and readiness, and that means ensuring our joint forces have the most effective medical solutions available, regardless of the environment. We are committed to supporting our partners in the U.S. Navy and Marine Corps in their mission of maintaining regional stability across the Indo-Pacific.”",https://d1ldvf68ux039x.cloudfront.net/thumbs/photos/2509/9294782/1000w_q95.jpg,N,0.0,2025-09-09 10:56:18.764432

The counties affected are Hawaii, Honolulu, Kalawao, Kauai, and Maui.

To receive an emergency refill of prescription medications, TRICARE beneficiaries should take their prescription bottle to any TRICARE retail network pharmacy. If the bottle is unavailable or the label is damaged or missing, beneficiaries should contact Express Scripts, Inc., or their retail network pharmacy for assistance.

To find a network pharmacy, beneficiaries may call Express Scripts at 1-877-363-1303, or search the network pharmacy locator: https://militaryrx.express-scripts.com/find-pharmacy

If possible, visit the pharmacy where the prescription was filled. Prescriptions filled by a retail chain may be filled at another store in that chain. If the clinician who prescribed the medication is available, beneficiaries can ask them to call in a new prescription to any network pharmacy.

As a reminder, TRICARE beneficiaries, other than active duty service members, may receive urgent care from any TRICARE-authorized urgent care center or provider and do not need a referral. This allows beneficiaries to seek nonemergency care for illnesses or injuries if their primary care provider is unavailable because of emergencies. Any TRICARE beneficiary who reasonably believes they have an emergency should always call 911 or, go to the nearest emergency room.

Beneficiaries are advised to visit Express Scripts’ Weather Notices page for updates: https://militaryrx.express-scripts.com/notices/weather

I'm on Tricare as an active duty military member. Our system is super bogged down right now and seeing a provider can take upwards of 6 months at times.

I have developed a RAPIDLY (<1 week) changing mole that meets all the criteria for melanoma. I was lucky and already had a dermatology referral in to my military health system, but their earliest available is in 5 weeks. All the literature on melanoma that I can find recommends that you get screened within 1 month of discovering the potential melanoma lesion and I have family history and have several risk factors.

I talk with my healthcare team and they say that I can find a provider out in town, but because I have access to a dermatologist via the military, Tricare won't cover it. Ok, that makes sense. So I start calling every dermatology office within 2 hours of me.

They. Won't. Take. My. Money. I keep explaining my situation to them and regardless of how much I guarantee that I will pay an exorbitant fee to prevent cancer -- as much as they would bill Tricare -- they all refuse and say that because I have Tricare, they cannot book me, even if I pay out of pocket.

Is there some law I am unaware of that is preventing them from providing me medical treatment? Tricare is telling me to call my local dermatology office 1-2 times per day to see if they have any last minute cancellations, which seems like a risky way to play with CANCER.

Any advice or insight is appreciated.",,N,0.0,2025-09-09 11:56:07.657325

The core creative visualizes this internal struggle with the tagline, ""When you have a gambling problem, it shows up everywhere.""

The visuals, created with a combination of AI and human manipulation, depict how gambling invades ordinary life scenarios like family dinners, a trip to the grocery store, or even attending a little league baseball game, prompting the audience to confront the issue head-on.

“Our work on Stigma Stand Down was informed by two things: our agency’s commitment to promoting mental health, and the Responsible Gaming initiatives we oversee for our three state lottery clients in Colorado, North Carolina and Indiana,” said Cactus Founder and CEO, Joe Conrad. “Problem gambling never exists in a vacuum and with the Stigma Stand Down campaign we wanted to send the message that there are a number of steps you can take to address problem gambling or other mental health issues in a non-judgemental, helpful, and confidential way.”

The new campaign aims to provide a judgment-free zone for support, offering resources like TRICARE-covered telehealth and evidence-based tools.

In the 2020 case, Ali participated in a conspiracy to pay kickbacks for urine samples referred for testing to Central Diagnostic Laboratory, one of his companies.
He also admitted signing prescriptions for controlled substances to patients suspected of selling or giving away drugs.
He also agreed to surrender his DEA registrations allowing him to administer controlled substances.","A St. Louis-area physician has been sentenced to nearly six years in federal prison for his role in two separate health care fraud cases.

U.S. District Judge Henry E. Autrey on Monday sentenced Dr. Asim Muhammad Ali, 54, to 70 months in prison. Ali was also ordered to pay $1,845,916 in restitution for the 2020 case and $3,902 for the 2024 case.

In the 2020 case, Ali participated in a conspiracy to pay kickbacks for urine samples referred for testing to Central Diagnostic Laboratory, one of his companies. He also admitted signing prescriptions for controlled substances to patients suspected of selling or giving away drugs. Prosecutors said Ali pre-signed prescriptions for patients of the Institute for Pain Management LLC without seeing them, rarely reviewing charts or verifying legitimate medical need.

Judge Autrey ordered Ali and his codefendants to repay $950,381 to the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, $13,993 to Tricare, and $881,542 to Missouri Medicaid.

In the 2024 case, Ali agreed to provide services for Medicare patients of Dr. Mohd Azfar Malik’s company, Psych Care Consultants LLC, but billed under Malik’s name and Medicare number. Medicare was charged for “annual wellness visits,” but Ali did not meet patients in person and instead conducted phone calls asking brief questions. Medicare paid $3,902 for the fraudulent claims.

Ali pleaded guilty in the 2020 case to conspiracy to illegally distribute controlled substances, illegal prescribing, paying illegal kickbacks for referrals, and submitting false claims. In the 2024 case, he pleaded guilty to conspiracy to illegally distribute controlled substances and maintaining a drug-involved premises.

Malik pleaded guilty to two counts of making false statements related to health care matters. He admitted submitting fraudulent claims to Medicare, Medicaid, and private insurers by billing for services he did not personally perform. He also billed for ketamine infusions administered by Ali despite knowing Ali was under indictment and lacked authorization from the Drug Enforcement Administration. Malik’s actions caused losses of $19,442.

In August, Malik was sentenced to five years of probation, fined $20,000, and ordered to repay $19,442. He also agreed to surrender his DEA registrations allowing him to administer controlled substances.",https://www.kttn.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Prison-Sentence.jpg,N,0.0,2025-09-09 06:56:29.554964

Specifically, the law applies only to minors, while the Pentagon is restricting health care for all dependents.
“This is a sweeping reversal of military health policy and a betrayal of military families who have sacrificed for our country,” Sarah Austin, staff attorney at GLAD Law, said in a statement.
The restrictions on gender-affirmation health care are part of a broader effort by the Trump administration to erase transgender people from public life.

In a lawsuit filed Monday, three families are alleging that the administration’s moves go beyond a law that was passed last year to restrict gender-affirming care for military children and violate a separate law that says federal regulations cannot be “arbitrary and capricious.”

“Tricare’s sudden refusal to cover medically necessary care has inflicted profound harm on plaintiffs,” the lawsuit says.

“Their prescriptions have been cut off without notice,” it continues. “Their trusted doctors at military hospitals have been forced to abandon them. Plaintiffs’ families now face significant and, in some cases, crushing out-of-pocket costs or the prospect of watching their family member’s health deteriorate without the medications that kept them healthy and stable. This is not an abstract policy shift – it is an immediate and devastating disruption of essential health care that affects the physical and psychological well-being of plaintiffs and other young people throughout the country.”

A Defense Department spokesperson declined to comment on active litigation.

The plaintiffs in the lawsuit, which was filed by two LGBTQ+ advocacy groups on behalf of the families, are anonymous to protect the children’s privacy. But the suit details the families’ struggles to get care.

Two of the children, referred to in the lawsuit as Diana Doe and Nathan Noe, were taking hormones with their parents’ consent on the advice of their doctors at Walter Reed National Military Medical Center in Maryland. This spring, they were told by their Walter Reed doctors that the medical center could no longer provide the hormone therapy, but neither family ever received a notice from Tricare about benefits changing, according to the lawsuit.

The third plaintiff, known as Parker Poe, who is described as a young adult, has been unable to access treatment after his doctor at an unnamed medical facility informed the family that Tricare would no longer cover his testosterone or related care.

“He is months overdue for the lab work that he needs to monitor his treatment. Additionally, without Tricare coverage, Parker’s prescription for testosterone [redacted] was too expensive to purchase out-of-pocket,” the lawsuit says. “This process has resulted in unnecessary stress and panic.”

The hardships detailed in the lawsuit come after Congress passed a law last year that barred Tricare from covering any “medical interventions for the treatment of gender dysphoria that could result in sterilization” for beneficiaries who are minors.

The law didn’t specify which treatments would be banned, but it was widely expected to prohibit hormone therapy and puberty blockers, as well as surgery, which is a very rare treatment for transgender minors.

In January, President Donald Trump also issued an executive order that attempted to ban any federal funding from going toward puberty blockers, hormones or surgery for anyone under 19 years old.

Throughout the spring, defense health officials issued policies and memos to implement the law and the executive order that cumulatively barred military treatment facilities from providing and Tricare from covering gender-affirmation care for military dependents of any age, including minors and adult children.

Trump’s executive order and the Pentagon’s implementation go beyond what last year’s law required, the lawsuit argues. Specifically, the law applies only to minors, while the Pentagon is restricting health care for all dependents.

Further, the lawsuit said, the law “does not support a categorical ban” on puberty blockers and hormone therapy.

“Puberty blockers and hormones for treatment of gender dysphoria do not cause ‘sterilization,’” the lawsuit says. A Pentagon memo “misstates the medical evidence by conflating potential fertility impacts with sterilization. DoD then uses this conflation to categorically deny gender transition treatments to all transgender adolescents and young adults, despite the absence of individualized medical justification and despite the statute’s limited scope, which does not support such a broad application.”

The lawsuit also argues that the new health care policies violate the Administrative Procedure Act, which allows courts to block policies that are arbitrary or capricious.

The lawsuit was filed in federal district court in Maryland by GLBTQ Legal Advocates and Defenders, or GLAD Law, and National Center for LGBTQ Rights, or NCLR.

“This is a sweeping reversal of military health policy and a betrayal of military families who have sacrificed for our country,” Sarah Austin, staff attorney at GLAD Law, said in a statement. “When a service member is deployed and focused on the mission, they deserve to know their family is taken care of. This administration has backtracked on that core promise and put service members at risk of losing access to health care their children desperately need.”

The same pair of organizations is representing service members in a separate lawsuit against the Trump administration’s ban on transgender troops.

The restrictions on gender-affirmation health care are part of a broader effort by the Trump administration to erase transgender people from public life.

In addition to kicking out transgender troops and denying health care to transgender military kids, the administration has banned books about transgender people from Defense Department schools and ended gender-affirmation care at the Department of Veterans Affairs. Outside of military and veterans spheres, the administration has also tried to remove transgender people from the history of the Stonewall riots, blocked transgender people from changing the gender marker on their passports, and tried to force states to ban transgender women from competing in women’s sports.

Last week, Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth also posted on social media that he was firing a Navy doctor after Libs of TikTok, a conservative account focused on publicly shaming LGBTQ+ people, posted a screenshot of her LinkedIn page that said she provides transgender health care at a Navy hospital in California.
