“How close am I to being memorialized?”

Yet above the whirring of medical equipment around him, the beeps of his heart rate, and the sympathetic, soft voices of the doctors telling him that they had to amputate his leg to save his life—a second thought emerged:

“I’m not going to quit.”

Days earlier, Gadson had been on a routine patrol in Baghdad, Iraq. He was thrown from his vehicle after it was struck by an improvised explosive device. Gadson was in critical condition, his legs and arm severely damaged from the attack.

“All I knew how to do was push back, even in this fog and moment of uncertainty, not knowing what to expect.”

What Gadson didn’t know at the time was that his story of resilience would define his life’s work moving forward. He would remain on active duty, promoted to the rank of colonel, take command of one of the largest U.S. Army installations in the world, and serve 26 years in the U.S. Army. In retirement, Gadson would become a motivational speaker, sharing his story of how he recovered, rebuilt, and persevered in the years following his injuries. His compelling message would inspire crowds at events and conferences even in front of thousands of military health professionals at the 2024 Military Health System Research Symposium. Gadson would highlight the importance of medical training, and how the character of the military medical experts involved in his care, were instrumental in saving his life.

He would discuss his journey with NFL teams who went onto victory, with cadets looking upon their next chapter of life, with Department of Defense staff about hiring those with disabilities. He would share his story as encouragement to carry on, to spark hope to those fighting for recovery, and to tell others to “be the best you can today … and moving forward, really embrace health,” said Gadson.

Football-Turned-War Hero

A football star in his youth, Gadson followed his dream of becoming a professional football player—all the way to U.S. Military Academy at West Point.

“That was the most important thing, in the back of my mind, to have a pro-football career,” Gadson said. “You might say I went there with a bit of a chip on my shoulder, because I wanted to prove that I could play at the highest level.”

While football and good grades may have brought him to school, it was the mindset of the military that truly became his passion.

Sports served as “a tremendous sort of development and building block. In my maturing as an athlete that, in a lot of ways, I took that into being a soldier. We have a five-year service obligation after attending the academy and I thought I would transition out and try to find my way back into football. But I fell in love with being a soldier and I just decided to keep going.”

Gadson rose through the ranks as a field artillery officer and through the guidance of “strong noncommissioned officers that I say raised me right, raised me to understand how to care, to hold us to task and to living up to standards,” that allowed him to lead soldiers.

“What kept me in was really the sense of being on a team, the sense of being part of something greater than myself, which was, ironically, very similar to being on a football team,” he said. “One of the common bonds between team sports and in our military, what we do is the sense of commitment. And I say all the time that commitment's blind it's without condition.”

As he excelled in his military career, Gadson’s West Point football teammate was also striving for success—Paul Pasquina, who was studying medicine. Their journeys would connect later in ways neither of them would have predicted.

Gadson went on to serve in Operations Desert Shield/Storm in Kuwait, Operation Joint Forge in Bosnia-Herzegovina, Operation Enduring Freedom in Afghanistan, and Operation Iraqi Freedom, where that one night would change his life forever.

May 7, 2007

Gadson’s battalion was returning from a memorial service in Iraq. As the patrol neared the base, it was struck by an IED.

A 19-year-old private—who had just completed a two-week medic training course—rushed to his side to treat his injuries. Before their deployment, the private had trained with his platoon, and Gadson personally had him “pulled up to be a medic because I was the senior guy in the organization. I didn’t want to break up all the teamwork that they had built for deployment.”

His senior leader intuition about the young private proved right.

“The doctors gave this young man credit for saving my life by how well he put the tourniquets on my legs,” Gadson said. “My soldiers had my life in their hands.”

After he was evacuated off the battlefield and rushed into triage, Gadson, ever the charismatic leader, found a moment of humor amid the chaos.

“They got me (triaging) in the medical clinic on the base, and they're trying to get the bleeding stopped … there’s a nurse who’s trying to get my glove off of me. I look up at him and said, ‘How are you going to save my life if you can’t get my glove off?’”

He quickly lost consciousness and was rushed to the hospital, where Gadson would go through “129 pints of blood and go into (cardiac) arrest six times … but the doctors didn't give up on me and they kept fighting for me.”

Gadson stabilized in a combat support hospital in the Green Zone, then was flown to Landstuhl Regional Medical Center, Germany, and Joint Base Andrews, and finally onto Walter Reed Army Medical Center, now part of the Walter Reed National Military Medical Center.

A sense of familiarity came to Gadson as a member of his care team: Pasquina, now a U.S. Army colonel and doctor, recognized his former teammate.

Fate aside, his health care team had to give him the grim news about what they needed to do to save his life.

“I required surgery every other day to repair my blood vessels and clean up my wounds,” he said. “A week after arriving at Walter Reed, the doctors had to take my left leg to save my life. The blood vessels could no longer sustain blood flow, so they amputated my left leg above the knee. Ultimately, I would make the decision for them to take my right leg, because it was a not going to function as it was intended.”

He also had limited use of his right arm, learning that “my upper bicep and elbow were broken as well. That would require some surgery. And unfortunately, I had some complications from that surgery.”

Gadson also developed heterotopic ossification at the end of his legs, a condition where bone tissue forms abnormally in soft tissues outside of the skeletal system.

He said it was “one of my lowest moments because I was down to one limb. My nondominant left arm and hand was really all I had to use for all my activities of daily life. I needed someone to help me.”

Family and Seeking Support

That someone to help him was his wife. They had met as classmates at West Point, married, and had children before the attack. It was her “unconditional love” that “underwrote my recovery,” he said. “I didn't have to worry about her leaving me or my family, not wanting to be around me, wanting to shun me because I was way different. No family ever asks for this, and we certainly didn't. But she stepped up and led our family, my kids, through this.”

As Gadson adjusted to his new way of life and coped with the emotional and physical trauma of his injuries, his wife urged him to seek mental health support.

“I didn't want professional mental health, but she said, ‘We’re all going through this; you got to get some help.’”

Gadson sought his care team at Walter Reed. He started to receive mental health support for his injuries. He never lost sight of his primary goal—to continue to serve.

“I wasn't going to let myself be defined by these injuries. I was going to be defined by what I was willing to do. And so I fought to continue to stay on active duty, which ultimately was approved.”

He remained on active duty in the U.S. Army for seven years after the IED attack, eventually becoming garrison commander of Fort Belvoir, Virginia, where he oversaw the daily operations for more than 140 commands and agencies for the Department of Defense. He also sought treatment from the Soldier Recovery Unit at Walter Reed—participating in unique therapies, including “elements of adaptive reconditioning,” such as riding horses, cycling, and skiing—all tailored for his healing experience.

“I thought they were absolutely brilliant because my mission was to heal,” he said. “You don't need to feel bad about being there … you need to take advantage of it because you can grow. When you struggle in life, that's when we grow.”

‘Angels’ in Recovery

When Gadson retired from the military, he realized that he had a story “people wanted to hear,” he said. As military leaders, “we have a moral obligation, a responsibility to share our life experiences. The good, the bad, the ugly. And that's strength.”

In his motivational career, he has spoken with service members in recovery, co-wrote a book, titled, “Finding Waypoints: A Warrior’s Journey Towards Peace and Purpose,” and even gave inspirational speeches to the NFL New York Giants football team, merging his passion for sports with his unprecedented story of resilience.

Aside from his own determination, grit, and strive for excellence, Gadson references his MHS care team for his successes.

“That's how I describe this network of angels in my care, everything literally was perfect, right?” Gadson said. “I'm not supposed to be here, and I'm here.”

He encourages people to think about Memorial Day as inspiration to carry on.

“My motivation is to live my best life for those who didn't make it home,” he said. “I have to make their sacrifice worth it. And the only way I make their sacrifice worth it is to make the most of my life.”",https://d1ldvf68ux039x.cloudfront.net/thumbs/photos/2408/8616272/1000w_q95.jpg,N,1.0,2025-05-22 14:56:31.369113

Take Smart, Strategic Step Toward Getting Help Using military insurance for detox and rehab isn’t just a practical choice—it’s a strategic one.","For active-duty service members, veterans, and their families, navigating treatment for substance use and mental health disorders can feel overwhelming. Many wonder if military insurance—such as TRICARE or VA health benefits—is truly a smart and reliable way to access detox and rehab services.

The short answer is yes, military insurance can be a highly effective option for receiving professional addiction treatment. However, understanding the scope of coverage, eligibility requirements, and how to make the most of these benefits is key to maximizing this valuable resource.

That’s why Downbeach is stepping in with this resource to assist you with your decision.

Understanding Military Insurance Options for Treatment

Military insurance typically falls under two primary programs: TRICARE and the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) healthcare system. TRICARE provides health coverage to active-duty service members, retirees, National Guard and Reserve members, and their families.

The VA offers healthcare benefits primarily to veterans, with services administered through VA Medical Centers and affiliated facilities. Both systems include provisions for mental health and substance use disorder treatment, including medically supervised detoxification, inpatient rehab, outpatient therapy, and medication-assisted treatment (MAT).

TRICARE operates similarly to civilian insurance, contracting with private treatment providers who meet network qualifications. Plans under TRICARE include Prime, Select, and Reserve Select, each with different cost structures and referral requirements.

Meanwhile, VA benefits are coordinated through the veteran’s assigned VA Medical Center and often require eligibility verification based on service history, disability status, or other criteria.

The Rising Need for Detox and Rehab Among Military Populations

Military personnel face unique stressors; combat exposure, traumatic brain injuries, PTSD, chronic pain, and frequent relocations, all of which can increase the risk of developing substance use disorders.

Alcohol misuse, prescription drug dependency, and co-occurring mental health conditions are particularly prevalent among veterans and active-duty service members. Unfortunately, stigma and logistical challenges have historically created barriers to seeking care.

The Department of Defense and VA have acknowledged these challenges and have made concerted efforts to expand access to treatment. Using military insurance to pursue rehab or detox services is not only smart but also increasingly encouraged.

These systems aim to reduce stigma, streamline access, and improve outcomes by partnering with reputable treatment centers across the country.

What Services Are Typically Covered by Military Insurance?

You’ll want to locate residential programs that take TRICARE or VA benefits. Both can cover a broad spectrum of treatment options, though some restrictions may apply depending on the plan and provider. Covered services often include:

Medical Detoxification: For individuals physically dependent on substances such as alcohol, opioids, or benzodiazepines, medically supervised detox is often the first step. TRICARE and VA plans generally cover inpatient detox, which includes 24/7 monitoring, medication support, and stabilization.

Inpatient Residential Treatment: Following detox, residential rehab provides a structured, supportive environment where clients receive counseling, behavioral therapy, group support, and dual diagnosis care. Both TRICARE and VA can cover residential care, particularly when deemed medically necessary.

Partial Hospitalization and Intensive Outpatient Programs (PHP/IOP): These structured day programs offer comprehensive therapy without requiring overnight stays. Military insurance typically includes coverage for these step-down levels of care, which are ideal for maintaining progress after inpatient treatment.

Outpatient Therapy and Aftercare: Long-term recovery often involves ongoing therapy. TRICARE and the VA support various outpatient services, including individual counseling, psychiatric follow-ups, group therapy, and relapse prevention planning.

Medication-Assisted Treatment (MAT): MAT uses FDA-approved medications like Suboxone or Vivitrol to manage cravings and reduce relapse risks. Military insurance covers MAT when prescribed as part of a comprehensive care plan.

What to Watch Out for: Authorization, Referrals, and Network Status

While the benefits are extensive, successfully using military insurance for detox and rehab requires attention to administrative details. For TRICARE users, seeking care from an in-network provider simplifies the process and reduces out-of-pocket costs.

Depending on the plan, a referral from a primary care manager (PCM) may be required before admission to a treatment facility.

VA-covered treatment, on the other hand, often involves a more centralized process. Veterans must first be enrolled in VA health care and receive a diagnosis through their assigned VA provider. From there, they may be referred to a VA facility or a community provider under the VA’s Community Care Network.

In emergencies or urgent situations, VA benefits may also cover care at non-VA facilities, provided eligibility criteria are met.

For both systems, pre-authorization is often required, especially for residential care or high-cost services. This step confirms that the treatment is medically necessary and that the chosen facility is approved to accept military insurance. It’s wise to work with a treatment center that has dedicated admissions staff experienced in military insurance verification.

Why Choosing a Military-Approved Rehab Facility Matters

Not all treatment centers are created equal, and when finding help using your military insurance, it’s important to choose a facility that understands the needs of service members and veterans. Some centers specialize in treating trauma, PTSD, and military-related behavioral health issues, offering evidence-based approaches tailored to this population.

Facilities that are in-network with TRICARE or contracted through the VA’s Community Care Network often have additional training, cultural competency, and programming aligned with military life.

These facilities may include therapies such as cognitive processing therapy (CPT), prolonged exposure therapy, EMDR, and veteran-specific support groups.

The quality and relevance of care directly affect long-term recovery outcomes. Partnering with a military-approved provider ensures that the clinical team is not only licensed and experienced but also aligned with military culture and values.

Financial Considerations: Is It Cost-Effective?

One of the major advantages of using military insurance is cost control. Compared to private-pay treatment, which can run tens of thousands of dollars, military insurance greatly reduces or eliminates financial barriers.

TRICARE plans typically feature lower deductibles, co-pays, and cost-sharing when care is obtained in-network.

VA services, for those who qualify, are often provided at no cost or minimal cost, depending on the veteran’s priority group and financial means. This makes treatment accessible even for those with limited income, unemployment, or housing instability.

However, it’s important to clarify all financial details before starting treatment. Admissions teams at quality treatment centers should provide cost estimates and explain what military insurance covers, what might be billed to the patient, and whether secondary insurance (such as Medicare or Medicaid) can help with any remaining costs.

Long-Term Benefits of Starting Recovery with Military Insurance

Addiction is a chronic disease, and timely treatment is one of the most important decisions a service member or veteran can make for their long-term health, relationships, and career stability. When individuals take advantage of military insurance for detox and rehab, they’re accessing care that’s backed by federally supported infrastructure, often with built-in pathways to continued support.

These systems also connect patients to broader community resources, including vocational assistance, housing programs, peer support networks, and mental health case management. Whether the goal is to return to active duty, transition to civilian life, or simply feel like oneself again, these benefits lay a foundation for stability and growth.

In many cases, starting with military insurance opens doors to other critical services, such as family counseling, trauma recovery, or treatment for co-occurring diagnoses like anxiety and depression.

These interconnected services can improve not just sobriety outcomes but also overall quality of life.

Choosing the Right Time to Seek Help

Knowing when to seek detox or rehab is a personal decision, but early intervention can make all the difference. Whether substance use has just begun to interfere with responsibilities or has already caused legal, health, or relational consequences, it’s never too soon to ask for help.

Military insurance is a smart choice because it removes many of the traditional barriers to access—cost, location, or lack of insurance. If you or a loved one are covered under TRICARE or VA benefits, there’s a structured, proven system in place that supports treatment and recovery.

Take Smart, Strategic Step Toward Getting Help

Using military insurance for detox and rehab isn’t just a practical choice—it’s a strategic one. These benefits exist for a reason: to ensure those who’ve served their country, and their loved ones, can access life-saving care when it’s needed most.

If you or someone you care about is considering treatment, don’t wait for the situation to worsen. Reach out to a treatment center familiar with military benefits, start the verification process, and get the guidance needed to take the first step.

With the right support, recovery is not only possible—it’s sustainable. Military insurance makes that journey a whole lot more attainable.",,N,1.0,2025-05-22 13:56:24.686502

Originally, NASA reported an expense of $417,798 on union time, but now the space agency is updating that figure to $893,620 over the 12 months ending Sept. 30, The Post has learned.

“As has been the case with other federal agencies under the Biden administration, NASA bureaucrats were racking up an astronomical tab doing union time on the taxpayers’ dime,” Sen. Joni Ernst (R-Iowa), whose office requested the data, told The Post.

“We need to end the absurd practice of taxpayer-funded union time across government to ensure that federal employees serve the American people, not themselves.”

NASA also spent more than previously known on union activities in 2023. Initially, the space agency reported spending $477,204 in fiscal year 2023, but now the agency is updating those figures to $636,189.

Meanwhile, its budget shrank from $25.4 billion in fiscal year 2023 to $24.88 billion in fiscal year 2024.

Taxpayer-funded union time includes labor meetings, union-sponsored training activities, preparations for collective bargaining, work on behalf of those facing disciplinary action and more.

Due to the Federal Service Labor Management Relations Statute, federal unions can’t negotiate with Uncle Sam on pay or benefits, which are determined by legal and regulatory policy.

Instead, federal unions negotiate over smaller-scale issues such as workplace procedures and telework policies.

“They’re left negotiating for tedious things that are of zero or negative benefit to taxpayers,” Rachel Greszler, a senior research fellow on workforce and public finance at the Heritage Foundation, previously explained to The Post.

“This includes things like the height of cubicle panels, securing designated smoking areas on otherwise smoke-free campuses, and the right to wear Spandex at work.”

In 2023, there were 43 employees at NASA who logged in taxpayer-funded union time, with about 6,588.5 hours of union work done that year.

By 2024, that jumped to 49, with 8,780.25 union work done, according to the new data.

NASA is covered by two prominent federal unions — the International Federation of Professional and Technical Engineers and the American Federation of Government Employees.

Ernst, who chairs the Senate DOGE Caucus, has been seeking to end the practice of taxpayer-funded union time and fired off a slew of requests to 24 government agencies demanding data.

NASA had been one of the first to respond.

In a statement to The Post, the agency said it always “complies with federal law.”

“In keeping with precedent, NASA is committed to providing transparency to those conducting oversight in the legislative branch,” a spokesperson said.

“NASA complies with federal law, allowing employees to be granted official time to perform certain labor union representation activities.”

So far, of the agencies that have divulged data to Ernst’s office, the largest expenditure on taxpayer-funded union time came from the Defense Health Agency, which spent $3.3 million on it in fiscal years 2023 and 2024.

DHA is tasked with overseeing TRICARE benefits for military members.

The Office of Personnel Management used to collect comprehensive data on taxpayer-funded union time, but stopped after 2019. In February, the Trump administration pushed agencies to report that data.

Col. Melissa Boyd, Licensed Clinical Psychologist, Defense Health Agency-Public Health

Service members encounter a wide range of both rewarding and demanding experiences throughout their careers. Some unique challenges can include frequent relocations, family separations, irregular work hours, and deployments. To help manage the mental health challenges that may result from these experiences, there are free and confidential resources available to support and enhance the well-being of service members.

Free and confidential mental health services

Service members’ ability to regulate emotions in healthy ways plays a crucial part in their ability to cope with challenges. Military OneSource and Military and Family Life Counselors (https://www.militaryonesource.mil/confidential-counseling/) are examples of free and confidential mental health counseling programs that offer military members and their families counseling to address short-term, non-medical concerns. Counselors within these programs are equipped to help service members improve healthy stress management, time management, and decision-making strategies and tools, including the ability to problem solve, manage conflict, build coping skills, and adapt to change. In addition, these programs foster health, resiliency, and readiness.

Military OneSource

Military OneSource is a U.S. Department of Defense program that provides free, short-term, solution-focused, confidential, non-medical counseling services for a wide range of issues, including relationship conflicts, stress management, parenting issues, coping with grief and loss, and managing deployments. Military OneSource supports active-duty, National Guard and Reserve service members and their families anywhere in the world and is available 24 hours a day, seven days a week at no cost. The program is comprised of master’s- or doctoral-level mental health professionals (in psychology, counseling, social work or marriage and family counseling) who are licensed to practice independently. In addition to providing counseling for military- and life-related stressors, Military OneSource offers webinars and online trainings on topics including tax services, spouse employment, relocation and deployment, and stress management.

Counseling sessions can take place in a variety of forms:

In person - Face-to-face confidential counseling in an office setting with a counselor located in the local community.

Telehealth - Confidential telephonic Military OneSource counseling for service members and family members who are unable to attend in-person counseling sessions. Telephonic counseling is only available to adults aged 18 and older.

Secure online chat - Online counseling via secure chat involving a real-time conversation with a counselor using instant messaging. Military OneSource uses state-of-the-art technology to transfer information over the internet securely. Chat-based counseling is only available to adults aged 18 and older.

Secure video sessions - Video counseling requiring a video-enabled computer. Military OneSource uses state-of-the-art technology to transfer information over the internet securely.

Children ages 6 to 17 are eligible to receive counseling in person or through video only. Family sessions are also provided for children ages 6 to 12 who may attend with a parent or caregiver present. For youth ages 13 to 17, a parent or caregiver must be available to give consent at the start of each counseling session.

For diagnosable conditions and concerns that are best suited for long-term care services not provided through Military OneSource, additional support and treatment options are available through military medical treatment facilities, embedded behavioral health clinics, and Tricare network providers.

According to Military OneSource (https://www.militaryonesource.mil/benefits/confidential-counseling/), the following issues are not appropriate or suitable for its counseling services:

• Active suicidal or homicidal thoughts

• Sexual assault

• Child abuse

• Domestic violence

• Alcohol and substance abuse

• Mental health conditions such as depression

Counseling through Military OneSource is also considered not suitable for individuals who are—

• Taking prescribed psychoactive medication

• Receiving therapy with another practitioner

• Involved in Family Advocacy Program cases

• Undergoing fitness-for-duty evaluations

• Undergoing court-ordered counseling

Military and Family Life Counseling (MFLC)

The Military and Family Life Counseling Program (https://www.militaryonesource.mil/benefits/military-family-life-counseling-program/) provides free, confidential counseling to service members, their families, and survivors on or near installations. Counselors are licensed to practice independently in the location where they are providing services and are trained to deliver valuable counseling services, briefings, and presentations to the military community. The MFLC program was designed to deploy counselors rapidly for short- and long-term assignments based on each military branch’s specific need.

The MFLC Program provides non-medical counseling for issues requiring short-term attention, including everyday stressors, deployment and reintegration concerns, parenting, grief and loss, and marital issues. MFLCs conduct consultation and outreach services to more than 200 military installations or nearby civilian communities located in most of the 50 states, the District of Columbia, U.S. territories and commonwealths, and over 25 foreign countries including areas considered hazardous duty/danger zones. MFLCs provide support to individuals, couples, families and groups for a range of issues including, but not limited to, deployment stress, reintegration, relocation adjustment, separation, anger management, conflict resolution, parenting, parent-child communication, relationship and family issues, coping skills, homesickness, grief and loss, isolation from extended family members, children coping with the absence of a parent, child education, and spousal employment.

Additionally, there are Child and Youth Behavioral Military and Family Life (https://www.militaryonesource.mil/benefits/military-family-life-counseling-program/) Counselor programs that specifically provide support to military children and families on topics including, but not limited to, identifying feelings, bullying, conflict resolution, self-esteem, anger management, family concerns, problem-solving, coping with deployment and reunification, transition and moving, sibling and parental relationships, time management, and divorce.

Confidential mental health resources

Confidential counseling provides service members and their loved ones with resources and support to address a variety of issues and build important skills to tackle life's challenges.

Confidential counseling is crucial for the military because it allows service members to seek support openly and discuss personal concerns when needed without fear of repercussions on their career or unit standing. With confidential services, a service member’s personal information is not provided to their military chain of command, shared with family or friends, or released to other agencies. Although services are confidential, one caveat is that counselors are required by law to report illegal activities or situations where there could be danger to the service member or to others. These include suspected domestic violence and child or elder abuse or neglect.

Other benefits of confidential military counseling:

• Reduces stigma - By ensuring privacy, it removes the stigma associated with seeking mental health support, making it more likely for service members to access necessary care.

• Improves unit cohesion - Addressing personal issues through confidential counseling can help service members better manage their emotions and perform effectively within their unit.

• Builds resilience - Open communication with a counselor allows service members to develop coping mechanisms and build resilience against the unique stressors of military life.

• Supports family well-being - Confidential counseling is also available for military families, helping them navigate challenges related to deployments, frequent moves, and other stressors.

• Provided access to specialized support - Military counseling programs often provide specialized support tailored to military experiences, such as combat trauma or deployment-related issues.

In addition to mental health counseling services, there are apps that promote healthy techniques for managing stress, seeking help with life challenges, addressing health problems, and implementing safety measures against harmful behaviors.

We were seen on base happily, but recently the appt waits were wild. I called Tricare and explained my daughter was waiting 4 months for her yearly checkup. They switched her to an off base PCM. I made her an appointment and we went. When trying to make an appt for my sons 4 mo visit, base ultimately canceled it and he was going to be seen at 6 mo on base.

So, same as my daughter, I called to switch my son (was having trouble logging in), and they said oh it looks like him and your daughter both have X provider on base (not off base). I said that's odd because we switched her off base.

The rep switched both my son to the off base provider and daughter BACK to the off base provider. Has anyone had this happen?! Any idea if there is a way to find online what correspondence Tricare has had with you? We got letters about PCM changes, but I didn't keep them. I can only see my correspondence on milconnect and it is my proof of coverage.

The area on milconnect that normally shows as providers change by date has NO record of her being assigned this provider. The rep couldn't explain. I'm worried we will get a bill. I would never go to a PCM without first being assigned.",,N,-1.0,2025-05-22 12:56:35.809816

Paris, France and Munich, Germany, 22 May, 2025 – TRiCares SAS (“TRiCares”), a privately held pioneer in the field of minimally invasive treatment of tricuspid regurgitation, is presenting data in a late-breaking session at EuroPCR today from its first-in-human trial of Topaz, its Transcatheter Tricuspid Valve Replacement (TTVR) system.

Today, Dr Julien Dreyfus, MD, PhD will present 30-day post-procedural data from 20 tricuspid regurgitation (TR) patients treated with Topaz across eight specialist cardiac centers in Europe. The TRICURE First-In-Human study demonstrated significant elimination of TR in treated patients, with grade ‘none’ (0+) or ‘mild’ (1+) TR reported in all patients implanted with Topaz. In addition, zero permanent pacemakers were required due to the investigational device. The implantation procedure lasted, on average, 35 minutes.

These early clinical results from Topaz compare favorably with existing TTVR treatment approaches, with a procedure that is fast, easy-to-use, and less demanding of imaging specialists.

Further details on the data will be shared in today’s oral presentation at EuroPCR 2025 and on Clinicaltrials.gov.

“We are highly encouraged by the results of this first-in-human trial. These initial findings serve as important validation for our ongoing clinical trials for Topaz in Europe and the US,” said Ahmed Elmouelhi, President & CEO of TRiCares. “I want to extend our sincere gratitude to the participating hospitals, the dedicated interventional teams and clinical investigators who contributed to these patient outcomes. To date, the TRiCares team has overseen 60 Topaz implantations, and we continue to work closely with clinicians to refine the procedure and technique.”

The initial findings will be used to inform the company's ongoing European pivotal trial (NCT06581471) and U.S. Early Feasibility Study (NCT06506942).

About TRiCares

TRiCares is a privately held company developing Topaz, a minimally invasive tricuspid valve replacement system for the elimination of tricuspid regurgitation (TR). Topaz’s unique dual stent design is easy to implant and uses established transfemoral and transjugular delivery methods, avoiding the need for high-risk open-heart surgery. Topaz is designed to fit a wide range of anatomies and replaces the diseased tricuspid valve. Once in place, it flexes with every heartbeat. A European Pivotal Study and a US/Canadian Early Feasibility Study are underway, with progress being made towards FDA approval and CE marking. TRiCares has focused on TR since its inception and its ambition is for Topaz to become the valve of choice for the millions of TR patients worldwide, overcoming the limitations of current treatment approaches.

TRiCares is a global business, with offices in France, Germany, the US and Brazil, and is supported by a strategic partner and leading life science venture capital firms: 415 Capital, Andera Partners, Bayern Kapital, BioMed Partners, Credit Mutuel Innovation, GoCapital, Karista, and Wellington Partners.

About Topaz

The Topaz Transcatheter Tricuspid Valve Replacement (TTVR) System is designed to eliminate tricuspid regurgitation through a minimally invasive approach. This system consists of the Topaz Heart Valve Prosthesis and a catheter-based implantation system. It is developed exclusively for use in the tricuspid position and to provide a system for physicians that is safe and easy to implant. The unique two-stent valve prosthesis is inserted primarily via the femoral vein and transports the prosthesis into the right side of the heart, where it is finally released to replace the diseased tricuspid valve.

Talkspace also works with municipalities, school districts and state governments to provide its mental health services.
In Q1, mobile health services revenue was $45.2 million compared to $143.9 million for the first quarter of 2024.
Transportation services revenue in Q1 was $50.8 million, compared to $48.2 million for the first quarter of 2024.
In February, the company acquired PTI Health, a mobile lab collection and phlebotomy services company, to expand its in-home healthcare services.","There is a lot of macro ""noise"" in the market right now, as one Wall Street analyst called it, with higher tariffs, changes to federal regulations and economic challenges creating uncertainty for healthcare providers, payers and pharmaceutical companies. That, in turn, impacts health tech and digital health companies that sell their products and services to these industry players.

""There is a palpable pain in the market. People are uncertain and people are worried when they think about their financial viability going forward, that includes many of our customers,"" said Ido Schoenberg, M.D., chairman and CEO of virtual care company Amwell during the company's first-quarter earnings call.

But Schoenberg said the current economic uncertainty could benefit Amwell as customers see its virtual care platform ""as part of the solution"" to improve efficiency.

""The Amwell platform is all about efficiency. It's all about saving. It's all about growing revenue. The ROI for implementing Amwell platform is very significant in way of efficiency, savings, growth, things of that nature. And therefore, we actually see the trend becoming accelerating rather than decelerating despite the overall market sentiment and headwinds,"" Schoenberg told investors during Amwell's Q1 earnings call.

Here's how some publicly traded health tech and digital health companies fared in Q1:

Amwell

Amwell, formerly American Well, reported first-quarter revenue growth of 12%, reaching $66.8 million from $59.5 million in the same period a year ago, according to its first-quarter financial report (PDF). Subscription software revenue was 48% of total revenue at $32.2 million in Q1, up 30% from a year ago.

The company narrowed its losses, reporting a loss of $18.4 million in the quarter, compared to a loss of $73 million a year ago.

Amwell's visit volume was down 23% compared to a year ago, with 1.3 million visits in the first quarter.

The company reported adjusted EBITDA for the quarter was negative $12.2 million compared to negative $46 million in the same period a year ago. Amwell sold its Amwell Psychiatric Care business to Avel eCare, a provider of clinician-to-clinician telemedicine services, earlier this year.

Amwell continues to roll out products and services for the Military Health System as part of its contract with the Defense Health Agency.

In November 2023, Amwell announced it inked a major contract with the DHA to expand its reach into the government and public sectors. In partnership with Leidos, Amwell will provide a hybrid care technology platform designed to power the “digital first” transformation of the Military Health System, according to the company.

The contract, worth up to $180 million, will deploy Amwell's Converge platform to replace the Military Health System's video connect solution. The project will start at five initial sites followed by a phased enterprise rollout.

Amwell has now rolled out scheduled virtual visits across the Military Health System, Schoenberg said during the Q1 earnings call. Due to leadership changes at the DHA, the deployment of its automated and digital behavioral health programs will be pushed back to the third quarter rather than the second quarter, the executive said.

The enterprise go-live of scheduled virtual visits across the global military health system represented the ""most significant growth initiative"" in the company's history, Mark Hirschhorn, executive vice president, chief operating officer and chief financial officer, told investors during the earnings call. Software revenue grew over 30% from Q1 of 2024 as the company drove strategic client deployments, including the DHA project.

The company plans to reach positive cash flow by 2026.

Macroeconomic issues and tariffs were top of mind for analysts and investors on the Q1 call.

Schoenberg said Amwell's direct exposure to tariffs was ""minimal or nonexistent."" ""As you may know, we no longer manufacture —most of our hardware comes from third parties and the hardware business in general is a very small part of our business today,"" he said.

But, he added, ""Tariffs obviously impact the sentiment in the market overall and do create some problems for our customers as it relates to their relationship with other suppliers. However, as I mentioned earlier, we are really conceived as part of the solution, adding efficiency, growing revenue for our customers, so in that environment, there is a good ROI for investing in Amwell.""

For 2025, Amwell is projecting revenue of $250 to $260 million and American Medical Group virtual visits between 1.3 and 1.35 million. It's projecting adjusted EBITDA in the range of between a loss of $55 million to a loss of $45 million.

For Q2, the company forecasts revenue in the range of $62 million to $67 million.

Doximity

Doximity, an online platform for medical professionals, saw its top line grow 17% to reach $138 million in revenue in the most recent quarter versus $118 million a year ago. The company also reported subscription revenue of $132 million, versus $112.7 million a year ago, also up 17%, according to its fiscal fourth-quarter earnings results (for the quarter ending March 31, 2025).

Doximity also brought in profits of $62.5 million, versus $40.6 million, representing a margin of 45.2%, versus 34.4%. Adjusted earnings per share came to 38 cents per share.

The company’s top and bottom-line results in the quarter topped Wall Street analysts’ expectations.

And it reported adjusted EBITDA of $69.7 million in its fiscal Q4 versus $56.4 million, an increase of 24% year-over-year.

For the full fiscal year 2025, Doximity brought in $570 million in revenue, up 20% from $475 million in its 2024 fiscal year. Subscription revenue came to $544 million, versus $450 million, an increase of 21% year-over-year.

Net income for 2025 came to $223 million compared to profits of $147 million the previous year.

Shares of Doximity dropped 16% in early Friday trading after the company provided a soft outlook for its annual forecast when reporting financial results Thursday.

Citing macro uncertainty, Doximity provided initial fiscal 2026 guidance that came in slightly below Wall Street estimates: $625 million revenue midpoint versus the $634.6 million consensus.

For the first fiscal quarter of 2026, the company expects revenue in the range of $139 million to $140 million, representing 10% growth at the midpoint.

Doximity has a broad reach into the medical community as its network members include more than 80% of U.S. physicians across all specialties and practice areas. The company's paying customers include pharmaceutical manufacturers, health systems and medical recruiting firms who use its platform to market their products and services.

""We have not seen any signs of a market slowdown yet. But given the material policy uncertainty, we are assuming that there will be,"" Jeff Tangney, co-founder and CEO of Doximity, told analysts and investors during the company's earnings call on Thursday.

Anna Bryson, Doximity's chief financial officer, said the pharma HCP [healthcare professional] digital market is expected to grow at roughly 5% to 7% again this year. ""We believe it's prudent to assume the market growth rate could be on the lower end of this range, which is reflected in our guidance,"" she said.

Doximity still expects pharma to remain its fastest-growing business, noting that health systems are ""typically more near-term impacted by policy changes and macro uncertainty.""

The company provides software tools for doctors and clinicians and its clinical workflow tools saw record use in the fourth quarter with more than 620,000 unique active prescribers, Tangney said. Its workflow tools include our telehealth, fax, scheduling and AI tools. ""Our AI tools grew the fastest, again, last quarter, up more than 5x year-on-year. In short, as the practice of medicine grows both more mobile and more AI-powered, we're proud to be leading the way,"" he said.

The company offers an AI writing assistant, called Doximity GPT, that helps doctors draft prior authorization letters, insurance appeals and letters of patient support, among other tasks.

""In a short couple of years, we've seen AI tools like this truly change the mood in medicine from AI leery to AI cheery,"" Tangney said. ""For the first time in over a decade, there's genuine hope that physician burnout and information overload can actually be eased with technology.""

The company is increasing its investment in artificial intelligence, leadership said.

""We believe we are in the early innings of realizing AI's full potential at Doximity, and we couldn't be more excited for the feature,"" Bryson said.

Waystar

Healthcare payment software company Waystar outperformed analysts' expectations in the third quarter with strong revenue growth and profitability. The company also booked its fourth consecutive quarter of double-digit revenue growth as a public company, according to executives.

The company brought in $256 million in first-quarter revenue, up 14% from the same period a year ago. That beat Wall Street estimates by 3%, according to Yahoo Finance.

Waystar reported net income of $29 million and GAAP net income per share of 16 cents, according to its Q1 financial results. Waystar's bottom results also beat Wall Street estimates. The company reported adjusted EBITDA of $107.7 million$108 million in Q1, up 16% from the prior year.

The company offers healthcare payment and revenue cycle management tools, serving approximately 30,000 clients representing over 1 million distinct providersHonor Roll. Waystar's platform annually processes over 5 billion healthcare payment transactions, including over $1.2 trillion$1.2 trillion in annual gross claims and spanning approximately 50% of U.S.patients.

CEO Matt Hawkins told investors during a call to discuss Q1 results that Waystar is ""uniquely equipped to create long-term shareholder value independent of broader market conditions,"" given the increasing macro volatility.

""While no business or sector is entirely insulated from economic cycles, we believe Waystar's broad presence and business model are recession-resistant. We are confident in our ability to deliver strong performance. Our software has enabled providers to succeed despite the challenges of an unpredictable environment,"" he said.

The company's software platform plays a ""mission-critical role in helping providers get paid faster and more accurately while reducing administrative costs."" Its payment and RCM tools help providers maximize revenue capture and streamline operational efficiency, which could become more critical if policy changes put pressure on providers.

In times of volatility and market stress, Waystar software can be deployed rapidly and efficiently to help providers optimize cash flow, he noted. Waystar does not anticipate any major impact from the Trump administration's potential healthcare policy changes, he said.

""We believe we'll be a net winner during this cycle as we help clients and as we stay very focused on serving them,"" he said.

While the potential impact of tariffs weighs on healthcare providers' minds, the company has ""very limited"" direct exposure to tariffs, CFO Steven Oreskovich told investors. Waystar has a diversity of clients in terms of size, specialty and geography to make it ""fairly insulated from anything that may happen to a specific specialty or type of reimbursement rate,"" he said.

The company continues to roll out new generative AI capabilities and advanced automation to target administrative waste across the U.S.healthcare system. In January, it launched Waystar AltitudeAI, a suite of AI capabilities designed to help providers streamline workflows and improve financial performance, including AltitudeCreate, a new generative AI tool focused on appealing denied claims.

Its Auth Accelerate solution marks a major expansion of its advanced automation capabilities designed to streamline the prior authorization process. Hawkins said early adopter clients are already seeing measurable results, an 85% auto approval rate and a 70% reduction in time spent on authorizations. The company is scaling its prior authorization capabilities for key payers across the ambulatory market, he said.

""What we know is that 90% of healthcare decision-makers that we're talking to, they are prioritizing AI and advanced automation to help them address this economic cycle. But the vast majority of them were still very early in the actual adoption and use of AI in this time frame. The vast majority have either been using it for less than a couple of months, AI in any form or not at all. So, we view this as opportunity,"" Hawkins said on the call.

Budgets for genAI-enabled solutions are increasingly being centrally pooled and funded at the largest provider organizations, Hawkins noted. ""These resources often sit outside traditional health care IT budgets. Incremental pools of capital are being allocated to fund key initiatives that deliver real ROI,"" he told investors.

Waystar raised its full-year revenue and adjusted EBITDA guidance. The company forecasts full-year revenue to hit between $1.006 billion and $1.022 billion, representing a $6 million increase at the midpoint of $1.014 billion. Adjusted EBITDA is expected to be between $406 million and $414 million. Diluted non-GAAP net income per share is expected to be between $1.31 and $1.34.

Talkspace

Online therapy provider Talkspace boasted its fifth consecutive profitable quarter. Talkspace reported net income of $318,000 compared to a loss of $1.5 million in the same period a year ago.

For full-year 2024, the company reported net income of $1.1 million, the first time it turned a profit on a yearly basis.

The company's revenue grew 15% year-over-year to reach $52.2 million in the first quarter of 2025, driven by 33% year-over-year growth in payor revenue, or insurance-covered sessions.

The company continues to focus on its payer strategy, which could help it weather a rocky 2025.

""I'd like to proactively address a common question we received amid recent market volatility. Our business is not directly affected by tariffs. More importantly, our long-term strategy has shifted the core of our business to an insured patient base, reducing reliance on out-of-pocket spending,"" Talkspace CEO Jon Cohen told investors and analysts during the company's recent first-quarter earnings call. ""As an in-network provider for nearly 200 million covered lives, we remain accessible and affordable. We are a national provider for Medicare, including Medicare Advantage and continue to benefit from the federal investment in senior mental health. Since we're not in Medicaid, we are insulated from potential changes to those programs.""

It ended the period with 101 million eligible payer lives, demonstrating growth of about 17% year-over-year. Payer sales came in at roughly $37.8 million, driven by 350,000 mental health sessions, up 23% year-over-year.

The company continues to expand its business with payers and employers and now covers nearly 200 million people in-network and through Medicare and Medicare Advantage plans as well as TRICARE, which serves U.S. military members and their families. As Talkspace grows, it is increasing access to virtual behavioral health services for seniors, teens and members of the U.S. military, executives said.

Nearly 200 million or two-thirds of the eligible American public can access Talkspace as a covered, in-network benefit, according to the company.

In January, the company rolled out additional military coverage and now covers all of TRICARE's 10.5 million members, including families and dependents.

The company is seeing strong results with its Medicare population as 84% of Medicare members showed clinical improvement, surpassing typical expectations of around 70%, Cohen said.

Talkspace also works with municipalities, school districts and state governments to provide its mental health services. The Trump administration has proposed significant cuts to funding for mental health programs that could impact schools.

In response to a question from an investor about the impact to Talkspace's business, Cohen said the funding freezes would impact in-person therapy. ""None of that impacts on us because of our virtual service,"" he said. ""We actually believe that because we are much less expensive and we have a larger ability to scale that it may actually be an opportunity for school districts to move from a dominant in-person model to a virtual model. So, right now, we are looking at that.""

The company's direct-to-consumer business continues to decline, with revenue dropping 32% to $4.7 million during the quarter. Its direct-to-enterprise business also is slowing with revenue coming in at $9.6 million, down 3% year-over-year during the quarter.

Talkspace continues to invest in artificial intelligence capabilities to enhance its services. It rolled out AI-augmented intake systems that surface key symptoms, psychosocial contacts and diagnostic considerations, streamlining client onboarding and clinical assessments. Cohen said.

In March, the company launched Talkcast, a personalized podcast feature. ""Our goal with this product is to drive member engagement between sessions, keep members focused on their progress and ultimately assist in clinical improvement. We have generated 6,000 podcasts in the first several weeks and are already receiving very positive member and provider feedback,"" Cohen said during the call.

Talkspace validated a new risk assessment tool, a homicide violence ideation algorithm that is over 90% accurate in determining risk for violent behavior, including homicidal ideation and surfaces this risk to clinicians in real time.

""I am purposely highlighting these AI initiatives in the context that utilizing advanced technology to deliver better mental healthcare solutions has been at the core of Talkspace since its inception when we developed asynchronous messaging as an effective method for delivering therapy. The next chapter in innovation and growth is to further integrate AI to deliver even better mental health support,"" Cohen said.

Talkspace claims it has the largest behavioral health data sets in the industry and is working to use this data to build a ""first-of-its-kind"" foundational large language model. ""Talkspace is uniquely positioned to build this foundational model trained on de-identified clinical data aligned with evidence-based therapeutic frameworks. Unlike horizontal general-purpose models, this vertical AI platform will not only enhance existing Talkspace services but also serve as a launch pad for future AI applications and behavioral health services, unlocking new possibilities in clinical innovation,"" Cohen said.

Talkspace is projecting full-year revenue to be in the range of $220 million to $235 million and adjusted EBITDA to be in the range of $14 million to $20 million.

DocGo

During its first-quarter earnings call, DocGo, a provider of technology-enabled mobile health and medical transportation services, highlighted a major shift in its revenue guidance as a result of policy changes affecting its government population health business.

""Ongoing policy changes and budget cuts in Washington have created substantial uncertainty and indecisiveness with regard to new municipal project launches and the government RFP channel in general,"" DocGo CEO Lee Bienstock said during the recent earnings call. ""In fact, we are seeing substantial delays with regard to municipal decision-making and delays in launch timelines for contracts we've already signed. We have 35 open government RFP submissions in our pipeline, a number of which were submitted over six months ago that we are still waiting to hear back on.""

Some projects that were ready to launch have been put on hold, Bienstock said. ""Accordingly, we can no longer rely on these to generate meaningful revenue this calendar year,"" he noted.

There's ""substantial indecisiveness and hesitation"" from the federal level down to municipalities as a result of policy changes coming out of Washington, he said, and that directly impacts DocGo's government business.

As a result, DocGo removed government population health revenue, which executives estimated to be about $100 million, from its full 2025 guidance.

The company will focus on growing its medical transportation and mobile health businesses for providers, health systems and payers this year and in 2026, executives said.

""Our hospital and payer and provider verticals continue to perform in line with expectations and we believe they are on a solid growth trajectory,” Bienstock said in a statement regarding the company's Q1 financial results.

Formerly called Ambulnz, the company hit the public market in November 2021 in a special purpose acquisition company deal. Founded in 2015, DocGo offers what it calls ""last-mile"" healthcare services to patients in their homes or at work, such as testing, vaccinations, bloodwork, IV hydration, wound care, mobile imaging and EKGs, among other services.

The company's revenue dropped 50% year-over-year to $96 million from $192.1 million in Q1 2024, primarily due to the wind-down of migrant-related programs.

DocGo reported a net loss of $11.1 million (a loss of 9 cents per share) compared to a net income of $10.6 million Q1 2024. Adjusted EBITDA for the first quarter of 2025 was a loss of $3.9 million compared to adjusted EBITDA of $24.1 million the same period a year ago.

The company's results missed Wall Street analysts' expectations on both revenue and earnings per share. DocGo's stock fell sharply by 19% in after-hours trading after the results were announced on May 8.

In Q1, mobile health services revenue was $45.2 million compared to $143.9 million for the first quarter of 2024. The decline was due primarily to the wind-down of migrant-related programs, the company said.

Transportation services revenue in Q1 was $50.8 million, compared to $48.2 million for the first quarter of 2024.

The company reported record trip volume for its medical transportation business in Q1 and expects to end 2025 with approximately 575,000 total transports.

DocGo notched several contract wins including signing with a New York health plan to offer DocGo primary care services to members, a two-year contract with the North Texas division of a national health system to provide medical transportation services for their network of hospitals in Dallas and Fort Worth, Texas and a one-year contract that expands the company’s relationship with a California-based cardiology group.

In its provider and payer vertical, DocGo continues to see substantial growth and now has more than 900,000 assigned lives since the inception of its care gap closure program, up from 700,000 just a quarter ago, Bienstock said.

That business is on track to quadruple in size over a two-year period, he said. In Q4 2023, the company completed approximately 2,500 care gap closure and transitional care management visits. A year later, in Q4 2024, the number of care gap closure and TCM visits grew to over 4,400. DocGo is now projecting to complete over 11,500 care gap closure and TCM visits by Q4 of this year.

In February, the company acquired PTI Health, a mobile lab collection and phlebotomy services company, to expand its in-home healthcare services. In 2024, DocGo completed 144 primary care visits, and that number is expected to grow to 10,000 this year and over 40,000 in 2026, Bienstock noted.

PTI Health is on track to complete over 125,000 blood draws in patient homes in 2025 and projected to exceed 200,000 in 2026. ""All told, between our care gap program, PCP and mobile lab businesses, we expect to visit over 150,000 patients in their homes this year,"" Bienstock said.

The company's care gap closure PCP programs help health plans reduce healthcare spending by reducing readmissions and hospitalizations and also helps plans to address quality metrics, executives said.

The company's migrant-related work peaked in the fourth quarter of 2023 and the first quarter of 2024 and began to wind down in May 2024 with the exit from the New York City-based sites, executives said. The remaining migrant work with New York City Health and Hospitals is expected to be substantially completed by the midpoint of this year, CFO Norman Rosenberg said on the Q1 earnings call.

""We continue to expect approximately $225 million in revenue from our medical transportation services, $50 million from our payer and providers and $50 million from our remaining migrant services health care work, all unchanged from our previous expectations,"" Bienstock said.

The company revised its 2025 guidance from $410 million to $450 million in revenue with a 5% adjusted EBITDA margin to $300 million to $330 million with an expected adjusted EBITDA loss of $20 million to $30 million.",https://qtxasset.com/quartz/qcloud5/media/image/Featured%20Images%20-%20Fierce%20Healthcare%20-%202024-11-07T120907.288.jpg?VersionId=oZpQEB1vpcx.Lq6Nj7fJcs3CA.yHB0OE,N,0.0,2025-05-21 14:56:26.413809

During Swift Response, the initial phase of DEFENDER 25, OPMED’s Force Health Protection (FHP) team provided essential support and expertise to U.S. Army medical providers assigned to the 512th Field Hospital, 519th Hospital Center, 68th Theater Medical Command and 30th Medical Brigade, and 173rd Airborne Brigade.

FHP plays a critical role in bridging medical gaps by providing investigational medical products, which are authorized for emergency use by the Food and Drug Administration, to the Joint Force. This occurs when no FDA-approved solution is available or feasible to meet operational requirements, according to U.S. Army Col. Chuck Bane, director of FHP. His team works with combatant commands and regulatory experts across the globe to make lifesaving treatments available to warfighters when there is an urgent need.

DEFENDER 25 is a chance for FHP to exercise and validate their regulatory oversight processes and learn from frontline medical providers. The knowledge gained will assist the OPMED PMO in developing the next generation of medical treatment capabilities for the U.S. Joint Force.

""DEFENDER 25 provided a critical opportunity to assess our capabilities in a complex, multinational environment,"" said Bane, an Army veterinarian by trade. ""Our team focused on ensuring our partners with the 512th Field Hospital have the tools and knowledge necessary to protect the force while adhering to regulatory policies, even in the most challenging scenarios.""

The 512th Field Hospital, based at Kaiserslautern, Germany as part of 519th Hospital Center, established far-forward medical facilities in support of DEFENDER 25 at Vepriai Rocket Base. Part of the DEFENDER 2025 Hospital Exercise included the strategic deployment of prophylactic drug treatments that are designed to counter potential airborne biological weapon threats against U.S. Joint Forces operating in challenging and remote locations.

In partnership with the Joint Program Executive Office for Chemical, Biological, Radiological and Nuclear Defense Enabling Biotechnologies (JPEO-CBRND-EB) – which manages the Rapid Access to Products in Development (RAPID) program – FHP assessed the 512th Field Hospital’s capability to adhere to regulatory requirements for transporting, storing, and administering a simulated investigational pre-exposure treatment made available under an Investigational New Drug Expanded Access Protocol (EAP) in forward operational areas.

Under a concept of operations created by the JPEO-CBRND-EB RAPID team, a notional treatment was pre-staged in Germany in the weeks leading up to DEFENDER 25 through collaboration and logistical planning between FHP, JPEO-CBRND, the United States Army Medical Materiel Distribution Operations Center (USAMMA-DOC), and the United States Army Medical Materiel Center-Europe (USAMMC-E). During DEFENDER 2025, the FHP team worked with medics and medical officers on the ground at Vepriai Rocket Base to ensure all EAP use guidelines were followed, according to Chris Weselek, a product manager with FHP and a retired U.S. Army combat medic.

""Our priority is to equip our medical personnel with the confidence and understanding to safely and effectively utilize investigational medical countermeasures when standard options are unavailable,"" said Weselek. ""This collaboration with the RAPID team at DEFENDER 25 highlights the capability that the RAPID program will bring to the table while allowing us to validate our training and oversight processes in a realistic operational setting.""",https://dha.mil/-/media/Project/Images/News-Images/9039728.jpg,N,0.0,2025-05-21 14:56:29.764910

“The successful integration of these technologies within the Military Health System hinges on preparing the workforce.
“The balance between technology and humanity is crucial in the future of health care, and this is especially true in the military context,” Woodson said.
“Upscaling our military medical healthcare workforce for the digital age is not merely a matter of modernization, it is a matter of national security.
The ability to deliver timely, effective and efficient medical care in the modern battle space is paramount.”","Dr. Jonathan Woodson, president of the Uniformed Services University, spoke to military health leaders in March 2025 about how training future medical professionals needs to refocus on the rapidly evolving digital landscape in health care.

“We need a workforce that is not only clinically competent but also digitally literate, capable of using advanced technologies such as artificial intelligence, telehealth, and machine learning to enhance medical care in military operations,” said Woodson.

“Digital technologies and reality in digital health care present both an unprecedented opportunity and critical challenges for our military medical readiness, he noted. “The digital age in health care is defined by the integration of transformative technologies—and are no longer optional enhancements.”

“They are fundamental to delivering effective and efficient medical care today and tomorrow, and to meeting our mission of saving as many lives as possible.”

Training Future Workforce in Emerging Technologies

Woodson stressed the importance of training the future military medical workforce in new AI technologies and giving educators the capabilities to teach these tools.

“The successful integration of these technologies within the Military Health System hinges on preparing the workforce. We must prioritize especially in these times of workforce reductions and budget cuts, innovative education, rigorous training, and continuous development to ensure our medical personnel are ready to meet the demands of the modern healthcare environment and the future battle space.”

He added, “Digital age demands a workforce that is not only clinically competent, but digitally fluid.”

Although the reality, Woodson said, is that the MHS is facing a “significant digital skills gap.”

“We have insufficient numbers of digitally skilled health professionals to support the digital health transformation that needs to occur.” Woodson added. “This gap is not merely about access to technology; it is about access to skills needed to use it effectively and innovate with it.”

Adapting Curricula and Methods of Teaching

Transforming the way medicine is taught, and taking into consideration how current, and future students learn, should be considered, he noted.

Woodson said, “We must integrate digital health modules into our training curricula, leveraging simulation-based training, virtual reality, and online learning platforms and more.”

Despite challenges incorporating AI and other emerging technologies into medical education, Woodson said “there is hope in the form of our resident young people, many of whom are digital natives.”

Growing up with emerging technologies, he noted, today’s students will not only lead the future of health care but are also transform the way they learn.

“Some of us are old enough that when we went to medical school, we had to read this enormous book,” Woodson said. “Not so much with the students of today … they boil it down to the essence, and then they convert it into a form in which it is easily digestible using AI.”

Woodson highlighted the development of AI-driven medical education at USU, including personalized learning, AI-powered content synthesis, and interactive simulations.

He described how some USU students have taken on responsibility to upgrade and enhance teaching methods using learning innovations.

“Our students are harnessing cutting-edge technologies to revolutionize medical education, optimizing learning efficiency, engagement, and exam performance. These AI-driven innovations enhance curriculum personalization, interactive tutoring, high-fidelity exam preparation, and medical interviewing simulations, transforming how future military physicians are trained, and potentially supporting shorter training and education times,” Woodson said.

USU’s Education Looks to the Future

Woodson highlighted innovative training models that USU has developed, including:

• AI-powered content synthesis

• Multi-modal learning resources

• Interactive AI tutor-enhance subject mastery

• AI-driven exam preparation

• Interactive medical interviewing of AI-simulated patients

Woodson said these new “personalized learning pathways are enhancing students' ability to master complex medical concepts and are designed to improve exam performance, develop communication skills, and create cost-effective, scalable training solutions.”

With these new teaching and learning methods, Woodson said the MHS can move students through their educational curriculum in three years.

“In the future, as we have to generate more forces, we need to be able to adapt technology and technology to generate these forces at scale and at the speed of relevance,” Woodson said. “More specifically, they have developed curriculum engagement programs that allow for personalized and adaptive learning.”

Despite Benefits of AI, Challenges Exist

Woodson acknowledged even though AI is the future, “we are clearly faced with several challenges in this digital transformation,” including:

• Resistance and trust: “Resistance to change in part, predicated on lack of trust, is a natural human response—but we must overcome it through effective leadership and clear communication about the importance of moving in this direction.”

• Funding and resources: “[These] are also critical, and we must advocate for investments in digital infrastructure and training programs.”

• Ethical challenges: “We must develop clear ethical guidelines and regulations to use these digital technologies in military medicine.”

Technology does not substitute for the human element, he noted, but “enhances, rather than replaces, human connection … the aim is merging high tech with high touch.”

Woodson made several recommendations for the use of AI in military medicine, including implementing a pilot program, developing ethical guidelines, prioritizing patient-centered care, and continuously evaluating these efforts.

“The balance between technology and humanity is crucial in the future of health care, and this is especially true in the military context,” Woodson said. “Upscaling our military medical healthcare workforce for the digital age is not merely a matter of modernization, it is a matter of national security. The ability to deliver timely, effective and efficient medical care in the modern battle space is paramount.”",https://d1ldvf68ux039x.cloudfront.net/thumbs/photos/2505/9051831/1000w_q95.jpg,N,1.0,2025-05-21 16:56:30.068021

“We’re proud that providers at federal healthcare facilities can now prescribe the Leva Pelvic Health System as an effective, first-line treatment for urinary incontinence,” said Randy Pritchard, CEO of Axena Health. “Leva enables supervised, at-home pelvic floor muscle training, giving women a convenient, and clinically proven option to manage urinary incontinence. Our modern approach is reducing barriers to care and helping more women – now including those who have served our country – access the treatment they deserve.”

Up to 20 percent of female veterans experience urinary incontinence (UI), a condition that often goes untreated due to stigma and barriers to access. Many veterans face heightened risks for UI due to factors such as extended periods without urination and a history of lifting heavy protective gear. These unique challenges, combined with common risk factors like pregnancy, childbirth, and menopause, increase UI risk among female veterans.

The Leva System is designed to provide women with a convenient, non-invasive option for treating UI through a modern approach to supervised pelvic floor muscle training. The physician-prescribed program uniquely combines the FDA-cleared Leva device and smartphone app to provide at-home guided treatment, personalized coaching, educational resources, and progress tracking.

Leva is now available on the Department of Veterans Affairs’ Federal Supply Schedule (FSS), GSA Advantage, and the Department of Defense’s Distribution and Pricing Agreement (DAPA) through a partnership with Lovell® Government Services, a Service-Disabled Veteran-Owned Small Business (SDVOSB) vendor.

“We’re proud to partner with Axena Health to advance technology that improves women’s health. Enhancing care for our female veterans is incredibly important to our company,” said Chris Lovell, Major, USMC (Ret.), CEO of Lovell Government Services.

After seeing positive results, DHA expanded the program across other eligible military hospitals.
” We are proud of our medical teams’ effort to meet the quality and safety metrics that Leapfrog has set.” The Leapfrog Hospital Safety Grade program, updated twice a year, evaluates public and private hospitals.","MAY 20, 2025 – The Defense Health Agency has announced that 16 military hospitals received an “A” rating in the latest Leapfrog Hospital Safety Grade assessment for Spring 2025. These high grades reflect the DHA’s ongoing dedication to transparency and providing high-quality care to service members and their families.

The Leapfrog Group is a national, independent organization focused on health care quality. The organization evaluates hospitals on a wide range of safety measures, including errors, injuries and infections. Leapfrog’s grading system uses up to 22 evidence-based measures of patient safety.

A hospital must meet specific criteria to be eligible for participation in the Leapfrog safety assessment. In the Spring 2025 ratings, 32% of participating hospitals nationwide received the highest grade. Of the eligible military hospitals participating in the grading assessment, 73% received an “A” grade.

“These most recent Leapfrog Safety Grades continue to validate DHA’s commitment to meeting high standards for the patients we are privileged to serve,” said Dr. Paul Cordts, DHA’s deputy assistant director for medical affairs and chief medical officer. “We are proud that the care provided at these facilities ranks among the very best in the nation.”

DHA’s engagement with Leapfrog began about seven years ago when it sought to incorporate Leapfrog’s evaluations into the Military Health System’s Quality Assurance Program. Walter Reed National Military Medical Center was the first military test site for Leapfrog surveys. After seeing positive results, DHA expanded the program across other eligible military hospitals.

“Our participation in this program showcases the consistent rigor our teams apply to safe, effective health care delivery.” said Cordts. ” We are proud of our medical teams’ effort to meet the quality and safety metrics that Leapfrog has set.”

The Leapfrog Hospital Safety Grade program, updated twice a year, evaluates public and private hospitals. Its grades are based on national standards for hospital safety and highlight risks that patients may face in a health care setting, including preventable medical errors and infections. The ratings are available to the public, making it easier for patients to understand the safety standards of their local health care facilities.

The 16 military hospitals that received an “A” grade in Spring 2025 are:

81st Medical Group, Keesler Air Force Base, Mississippi

673rd Medical Group, Joint Base Elmendorf-Richardson, Alaska

Alexander T. Augusta Military Medical Center, Fort Belvoir, Virginia

Blanchfield Army Community Hospital, Fort Campbell, Kentucky

Brooke Army Medical Center, Fort Sam Houston, Texas

Carl R. Darnall Army Medical Center, Fort Cavazos, Texas

Eisenhower Army Medical Center, Fort Eisenhower, Georgia

Evans Army Community Hospital, Fort Carson, Colorado

Madigan Army Medical Center, Joint Base Lewis-McChord, Washington

Martin Army Community Hospital, Fort Benning, Georgia

Naval Medical Center Camp Lejeune, Camp Lejeune, North Carolina

Naval Medical Center Portsmouth, Portsmouth, Virginia

Naval Medical Center San Diego, San Diego, California

Walter Reed National Military Medical Center, Bethesda, Maryland

William Beaumont Army Medical Center, Fort Bliss, Texas

U.S. Naval Hospital Guam, Guam

Some military hospitals were not included in the safety grades this spring because they did not meet the minimum requirements for reporting criteria used by Leapfrog. The DHA has instituted similar criteria internally to ensure patient safety for all facilities that did not qualify for official Leapfrog grades.

“We remain steadfast in our commitment to regular and transparent reporting about the quality of DHA’s health care,” said Cordts. “These latest grades should bolster our patients’ confidence that they are receiving exceptional care at our military hospitals.”

What Is TRICARE Prime?
If many of you don’t know, let’s first discuss what TRICARE Prime is.
The nice thing about TRICARE Prime Remote is that it provides the same kind of care and coverage as TRICARE Prime, but with more flexibility to use local doctors in rural or less-populated areas.
How to Enroll and the Cost We know the differences between the TRICARE Prime options, and of course, it’s important to know how to enroll and what the cost is.","In 2026, active-duty, military family members, and retirees living in Atlanta, Georgia, and Tampa, Florida, are going to have access to some new TRICARE Prime options. This is going to be effective at the beginning of 2026, and thanks to the award, that is making this possible, as they are running a three-year demonstration project to provide TRICARE Prime for 146,000 eligible beneficiaries in two cities.

What Is TRICARE Prime?

If many of you don’t know, let’s first discuss what TRICARE Prime is. It is basically a health insurance plan for military members, retirees, and their families.

It’s a lot like a civilian HMO (Health Maintenance Organization), and it is where you get most of your care through a network of approved doctors and hospitals.

One thing, though, the biggest benefit of TRICARE Prime is that it offers low-cost or no-cost care when you use approved providers and follow the rules of the program.

So when you enroll in TRICARE Prime, you’ll pick a Primary Care Manager (PCM), and this can be a doctor at a military clinic or hospital, or it might be a civilian doctor who works with TRICARE, which also becomes your main doctor.

Now, let’s see what TRICARE Prime covers:

Doctor visits for military families

Preventive care, like annual checkups and screenings

Hospital stays for military families

Emergency care for urgent attention

Mental health services

Prescriptions for illness

Specialist referrals from your main doctor

However, there’s just one important thing to know: TRICARE Prime is available only in certain areas, usually close to military bases, and it is not available to retirees and family members ages 65 and older who use TRICARE For Life and Medicare.

What Is TRICARE Prime Remote?

Now let’s talk about TRICARE Prime Remote – it’s a version of TRICARE Prime that is perfectly designed for active duty service members and their families who live far away from military hospitals or clinics, at least 50 miles or one hour away.

The nice thing about TRICARE Prime Remote is that it provides the same kind of care and coverage as TRICARE Prime, but with more flexibility to use local doctors in rural or less-populated areas.

If you’re one who qualifies for TRICARE Prime Remote, you still get assigned a Primary Care Manager, but it will be a civilian doctor instead of someone at a military base, and that doctor becomes your main contact for your health care, just like with TRICARE Prime.

There are just a few things you need to know about TRICARE Prime Remote:

It's only available to active duty members and their families

You must live in a remote area to qualify

You’ll use civilian doctors instead of military hospitals

Retirees and their families are not eligible

Even though the doctors are civilians, the plan still covers almost everything in the same way TRICARE Prime does because you usually don’t pay anything out of pocket, as long as you go to authorized providers.

How to Enroll and the Cost

We know the differences between the TRICARE Prime options, and of course, it’s important to know how to enroll and what the cost is.

If you want to sign up for either program, you can follow these steps:

Step 1: Choose a Primary Care Manager: You may choose a military or network provider as your PCM. If you don’t list a PCM on your enrollment form, they'll choose one for you.

Step 2: Complete the Enrollment Application: Enroll all family members on one enrollment form and send enrollment fees (if applicable) with your enrollment form.

Step 3: Get Started with TRICARE Prime: Your regional contractor will notify you when your enrollment is processed. Once enrolled, you can log in to milConnect to download your enrollment card and get your PCM’s name and phone number.

The following are the costs for TRICARE Prime options:

Active Duty Service Members

No out-of-pocket costs

No enrollment fees

No network copayments

No point-of-service fees

Active Duty Family Members*

Minimal out-of-pocket costs

No enrollment fees

No network copayments

Point-of-service fees if using the point-of-service option

Retired Service Members, Their Family Members, and Other Beneficiaries

Annual enrollment fees

Network copayments

Point-of-service fees if using the point-of-service option

There are no deductibles when you stay in the TRICARE Prime network. If you go outside the network without a referral, though, you may have to pay much more.

Why Atlanta and Tampa Are Being Added

Until now, families and retirees in Atlanta and Tampa could not enroll in TRICARE Prime unless they lived on or near a military base, and now, the 2026 change adds these cities to the TRICARE Prime service area, which means there are more people who can now enroll in the low-cost, managed-care plan.

It’s actually a big win for retired military families who want better access to affordable care, as well as our active duty families who are tired of long drives to military clinics.

So, the next step for you is to take time to review your current plan, understand the costs, and get ready for open enrollment when the new TRICARE Prime options become available.

• The Psychological Health Resource Center is available 24/7 for service members, veterans, and family members with questions about psychological health topics.

The lives of service members and their families are filled with many unique changes and unexpected events that may result in challenges with mental health.

“At the Department of Defense, we are building a culture where seeking mental health care is not only accepted—it’s fully supported,” wrote Dr. Stephen Ferrara, acting Assistant Secretary of Defense for Health Affairs at the beginning of May’s Mental Health Awareness Month. “From policy change and digital modernization to prevention programs and peer leadership, the Military Health System is transforming how we identify, support, and treat mental health needs across the force.”

Protecting, optimizing, and addressing mental health needs is vital to the readiness of the military force. Seeking support is a sign of strength and critical to maintaining and improving individual performance. For example, earlier this year the U.S. Air Force published a Mental Health Overview that explains the medical and nonmedical sources of support.

“We are encouraging people to take ownership of their psychological health. We all have a responsibility, and we believe the Mental Health Overview provides clarity on what is available to get you where you want to be,” said U.S. Air Force Lt. Col. Elisha Pippin, Air Force Medical Service director of psychological health. “Mental health is the clinical component of a system of helping agencies. Providers are there ready to support the warfighter, to heal and improve so they can get back in the fight.”

Your Connection to Mental Health Resources

The Military Health System is committed to ensuring service members and their families have access to the services they need to take care of their mental health. The MHS Mental Health Hub provides a wealth of resources, important information, and several options to access care for service members, families, and veterans so they can find their footing and get back on track.

The hub offers a comprehensive listing of mental health services available through the MHS, including ways to seek care, tips from experts, and in-depth information on available resources.

You can connect directly to mental health support services near you with one click, as well as access your TRICARE benefit to learn more about your coverage.

Resources Available in the MHS Mental Health Hub:

• Brandon Act, which empowers service members to get the help they need confidentially. Reducing stigma is a key aspect of the Brandon Act, honoring U.S. Navy Petty Officer 3rd Class Brandon Caserta, who tragically died by suicide in 2018. His story spearheaded a DOD policy and congressional bill, passed as part of the FY22 National Defense Authorization Act. Service members can start the referral process by talking to their commander or supervisor.

• Targeted Care, originally a U.S. Air Force initiative that scaled across the entire military health enterprise. This gets you connected to the specific type of care you need after initial evaluation, whether it’s an individual appointment, group therapy or nonmedical support such as a chaplain or a military family life counselor.

• BRAVE, the Defense Health Agency Virtual Medical Center’s Behavioral Health Resources and Virtual Experience, is the enterprise program of tele-behavioral health to supplement care currently offered through more than 40 military hospitals and clinics in the U.S. and overseas. This service connects a service member with a counselor through virtual sessions.

• Real Warriors, the DOD’s public health campaign via social media designed to decrease stigma, increase psychological health literacy, and open doors to access to care by encouraging psychological health help seeking among active duty service members, veterans, and their families.

• inTransition, a free, confidential program that offers specialized coaching and assistance for active duty service members, National Guard members, reservists, veterans and retirees who need access to mental health care when they are:

o Relocating to another assignment

o Returning from deployment

o Transitioning from active duty to reserve component or reserve component to active duty

o Preparing to leave military service

o Any other time they need a new mental health provider or need a provider for the first time.

• TRICARE, the DOD’s worldwide health plan, covers mental health services through its worldwide network of civilian providers. In some cases, once a referral is approved, you can have an appointment within a few days. To set up a mental health appointment through TRICARE, visit: tricare.mil/MentalHealth.

• Uniformed Services University’s Consortium for Health and Military Performance, or CHAMP, offers dozens of fact sheets, articles and infographics to help strengthen your mental health and help you grow from adversity. Got a question on mental health? Send a message to their experts.

• The Psychological Health Resource Center is available 24/7 for service members, veterans, and family members with questions about psychological health topics. Different from a counseling service, the center has trained mental health consultants to help you access mental health care and community support resources in your local area. Call 1-866-966-1020, start a live chat, or visit the resource center.

“Every service member should know help is available, hope is real, and your mental health matters,” wrote Ferrara. “Together, we are building a military where strength includes seeking support–and where no one fights alone.”",https://cdn.dvidshub.net/images/dvids_logo.svg,N,1.0,2025-05-20 16:56:22.393952

This comprehensive report provides crucial insights into the expanding role of community blood centers in supporting prehospital blood transfusion programs across the United States. It reveals that the number of community blood centers providing blood products for prehospital use has nearly doubled between 2022 and 2024, underscoring the rapid growth and increasing importance of these life-saving programs.

""Community blood centers are playing a pivotal role in the rapid expansion of prehospital blood programs across the nation. Our latest report shows an 89% increase in participating community blood centers over just two years, highlighting their commitment to expanding the availability of blood products and improving patient outcomes. As these programs continue to expand, America’s Blood Centers will keep working with our members, partners, and allies to address the significant barriers that currently prevent many patients from quickly receiving the blood products they need,” said Kate Fry, CEO of America’s Blood Centers.

The report reveals a significant upward trend in community blood center participation in prehospital programs. In 2022, 18 centers provided blood products for prehospital use, with 7 servicing both air and ground ambulance programs. By 2024, this number had nearly doubled to 34 centers, with 18 supporting both air and ground services. The study also highlights a dramatic increase in the supply of specific blood products for prehospital use, particularly Low Titer-O Whole Blood and Type-A Liquid Plasma units.

Based on annual surveys conducted from 2022 to 2024, the report offers valuable insights for policymakers and stakeholders in both the blood community and emergency medical services,underscoring the need for sustainable funding models, optimized inventory management, and enhanced donor recruitment strategies to support the growth of prehospital blood programs. The study notes that less than 2% of all emergency management systems carry blood and blood products today, indicating significant potential for future growth if current roadblocks were addressed.

America’s Blood Centers and its members urge Congress to modernize our nation’s approach to prehospital blood transfusions by updating federal insurance program payment polices to provide sufficient reimbursement for prehospital blood transfusions including updating TRICARE payment policy to remove financial barriers and allow for broader adoption of prehospital blood transfusions which supports TRICARE’s mission to improve the health of the military and their families and, in turn, helps support the security of the United States.

Founded in 1962, America’s Blood Centers (ABC) is the national organization bringing together community-based, independent blood centers across North America. These organizations operate in more than 1,100 communities and provide close to 60 percent of the U.S. and a quarter of the Canadian blood supply.

And as with any TRICARE plan, it’s important to know how this program works. You should be familiar with certain terms that can help you make the most of your pharmacy benefit.

One of those terms is prior authorization.

“Prior authorization is a common term in the pharmacy industry,” said U.S. Air Force Lt. Col. Leighcraft Shakes, deputy chief, Pharmacy Benefit Integration Branch at the Defense Health Agency. “Prior authorization is a routine process to ensure your prescription drug is medically necessary and cost effective.”

Keep in mind, prior authorization isn’t the same as pre-authorization. Pre-authorization is the process that TRICARE uses to approve medical care.

Note: If you have coverage through the US Family Health Plan, you don’t have coverage through the TRICARE Pharmacy Program. The USFHP has its own pharmacy plan.

Q: How does TRICARE determine which drugs require prior authorization?

A: The Department of Defense Pharmacy and Therapeutics Committee meets quarterly to determine which drugs:

• Are included in the TRICARE pharmacy benefit

• Identify those that require prior authorization

• Establish any additional coverage rules that may apply

Drugs that require prior authorization may include but aren’t limited to:

• Prescription drugs specified by the DOD P&T Committee based on clinical appropriateness and widely accepted clinical guidelines

• Brand-name drugs that have generic equivalents

• Drugs subject to age or sex limitations

• Drugs prescribed in quantities that exceed standard limits

Q: What does prior authorization mean for me?

A: Before filling certain prescriptions, Express Scripts, the TRICARE Pharmacy Program contractor, reviews and authorizes the medication based on criteria developed by the DOD P&T Committee. Once approved, your pharmacist can fill the prescription.

Q: How do I know if my prescription needs prior authorization?

A: The TRICARE Formulary Search tool provides information about:

• Drugs that require prior authorization or have quantity limits

• Coverage and copayments

• Pharmacy forms

• Options for filling prescriptions

• Common drug interactions

To find out if your medication requires prior authorization, follow these steps:

1. Use the TRICARE Formulary Search tool to locate your medication.

2. When searching, make sure to include your biological sex and age.

3. Download and print your drug’s prior authorization form.

4. Give the form to your provider to complete and send back to Express Scripts. They can submit prior authorizations via mail, phone call, or fax.

Q: What’s an electronic prior authorization?

A: An electronic prior authorization, or ePA, is a simple, secure way for your provider to submit prior authorization requests. They can electronically submit prior authorizations for prescriptions filled:

• At a military pharmacy

• Through TRICARE Pharmacy Home Delivery

• At a TRICARE retail network pharmacy

Q: How long does the traditional prior authorization process take?

A: Prior authorization approval takes about 10 days after Express Scripts receives the request from your provider.

Q: What happens if my prior authorization is denied?

A: Express Scripts will notify both you and your provider of the denial, the appeal process, and actions that can be taken to facilitate further review and consideration. Other options include working with your provider to change to a different covered drug or paying out of pocket for your drug.

Q: With the TRICARE Pharmacy Program, where can I go to get my prescription filled?

A: According to the TRICARE Pharmacy Program Handbook, you can fill your prescriptions in several ways, including:

• Military pharmacies

• TRICARE Pharmacy Home Delivery

• TRICARE retail network pharmacies

• Non-network pharmacies

Military Medical Excellence

The Defense Health Agency (DHA) has proudly announced that 16 U.S. military hospitals have earned an “A” rating in the Spring 2025 Leapfrog Hospital Safety Grade.

This recognition underscores the high standards of patient safety and quality care maintained by these facilities, which are crucial for service members and their families.

The Leapfrog Group, an independent national organization, evaluates hospitals based on up to 22 evidence-based patient safety measures.

These include errors, injuries, and infections.

Among eligible military hospitals participating in this assessment, a remarkable 73% received the highest grade, significantly surpassing the national average of 32%.

Commitment to Continued Excellence

This achievement highlights DHA’s ongoing efforts to integrate external safety evaluations into its quality assurance programs.

Dr. Paul Cordts, DHA’s deputy assistant director for medical affairs and chief medical officer, emphasized that these grades validate DHA’s commitment to meeting high standards for patients they serve.

“These most recent Leapfrog Safety Grades continue to validate DHA’s commitment to meeting high standards for the patients we are privileged to serve,”

Strategic Implications

Ensuring top-tier medical care enhances military readiness and resilience.

The U.S. military demonstrates leadership in adopting rigorous safety standards.

Transparent reporting may improve trust among service members and families.

Positive grades could justify increased funding for military medical facilities.

High-quality care supports U.S. humanitarian missions globally.

Diverse Stakeholders

The announcement involves several key stakeholders including the Defense Health Agency (DHA), The Leapfrog Group, Dr. Paul Cordts as a spokesperson on quality and safety matters, as well as U.S. service members and their families who benefit directly from these healthcare services.

Food for Thought

This recognition of military hospitals by The Leapfrog Group not only boosts confidence in the quality of care provided but also aligns with broader government initiatives aimed at improving public trust in federal services through transparency and accountability in healthcare delivery systems across the nation.

This is a success story.” That’s Dan Cnossen, a seven-time Paralympic medalist, former Navy SEAL and keynote speaker at the 2025 Military Health System Conference in Cleveland, Ohio.
“It’s steep, it’s too dark, it’s too rocky.
Speaking on how Ferrara saved his life, Cnossen said, “I owe him more than I can say.
Unparalleled Care, Perspective, and Focus Recalling his experience under the compassionate care of the doctors and nurses throughout the MHS, Cnossen wouldn’t have wanted to receive care anywhere else.","“Your mission is vital. I think you’re going to see in my story that I’m alive here, up on this really high platform, because of the Military Health System. This is a success story.”

That’s Dan Cnossen, a seven-time Paralympic medalist, former Navy SEAL and keynote speaker at the 2025 Military Health System Conference in Cleveland, Ohio.

Cnossen delivered his powerful story of perseverance and overcoming extraordinary challenges to nearly 2,000 conference participants, inspiring the audience with his captivating ability to set goals and shift perspective—even when it feels impossible.

In September 2009, Cnossen led a platoon in Taliban-controlled Helmand Province in Afghanistan. As he and his team moved into position on top of a hill overlooking the platoon’s target compound, everything changed in a flash of an instant.

“We got to the designated point and proceeded up the hill. It was about a 20-minute walk. We got to the top. I remember taking a step, and cautiously taking another step. I paused. Next thing I know, I saw a flash of light under my goggles,” he said.

Cnossen stepped on an improvised explosive device. “I needed my teammates. I remember feeling a rising sense of internal panic. I couldn’t do anything,” he said.

The details, he recalls, are few and far between. “It’s steep, it’s too dark, it’s too rocky. I remember landing on sharp rocks. It was slow and damaging to my body. [My team] dragged me by shoulder straps, rocks cutting into my body like knives. The medic was telling me to stay awake. That was my personal fight. I lack the words to describe this experience in detail. But for my teammates, it’s very tiring to do a body drag. It’s like a 60-second sprint.”

‘I Owe Him More Than I can Say’

As his teammate dragged him down the hill and into a helicopter, Cnossen blacked out. Thanks to the fast action of his team in Helmand, Cnossen was airlifted to Kandahar where a team of U.S. military doctors were ready to act. One of those doctors was Dr. Stephen Ferrara, now the acting assistant secretary of defense for health affairs.

Eleven days later, Cnossen awoke from a medically induced coma at Bethesda Naval Hospital in Maryland, now known as Walter Reed National Military Medical Center. His legs were gone, but he was alive.

Speaking on how Ferrara saved his life, Cnossen said, “I owe him more than I can say. He could have gone anywhere in the world to serve, but he accepted the call to serve in Afghanistan.”

A National Hero

A testament to his character, Cnossen recalls the worst part of his experience. Even after losing his legs, shattering his pelvis, and enduring seven-to-10 hours of painful surgeries week after week throughout his two-year recovery, the worse thing, he said, was “dealing with lying in an ICU bed, stuck. The platoon is going to deploy. I’m not there to share the risk. I’m here in this bed and I cannot get out. That was corrosive.”

Cnossen’s inspirational character and commitment to his team and mission were not lost on Ferrara. “We have a national hero and all-around amazing person here. A true American hero in every sense of the word,” said Ferrara of Cnossen during his opening remarks at the conference.

Enduring two years of pain, rehabilitation, and emotional distress, Cnossen did not give up. He made a conscious effort to change his mindset and overcome what many would consider unbearable.

“There’s this notion of perspective,” he said. “The way you look at a moment, there are many angles to look at a scenario. Ultimately, I had to look at the totality of the situation. Challenge yourself—there’s at least one good thing to find. My arms could work. My legs were long enough for prosthetics. My limbs were long enough. Maybe, I’ll get to run. That’s another thing I can look forward to. That was motivating.”

Bringing humor to his story, Cnossen shared that, as a double leg amputee, he would finally be over six feet tall. “Humor can really help,” he said.

Unparalleled Care, Perspective, and Focus

Recalling his experience under the compassionate care of the doctors and nurses throughout the MHS, Cnossen wouldn’t have wanted to receive care anywhere else. “All this care I was getting, this is the best place to be. The prosthetics I’m going to get, they’re the best. There’s no better place to be in this condition,” he said.

By intentionally shifting his perspective and focus, Cnossen found a path forward, first in rehabilitation at WRNMMC and eventually as a Paralympic athlete representing Team USA. He shifted his focus from what was lost to what remained: his functioning arms, his gratitude, and his life. This generated psychological momentum, driving him toward recovery and eventually, athletic excellence.

He also focused on making small steps: getting out of bed, meeting visitors, getting his wheelchair and eventually prosthetics, and just making it through the day. This gave him renewed purpose.

“That bomb in Afghanistan took my legs. Ultimately, it had to be up to me if it would take my life,” he said.

Cnossen was awarded a Purple Heart and a Bronze Star with Valor from the Secretary of the Navy. He is currently training to compete with Team USA in the 2026 Paralympic Games.

His captivating speech kicked off the four-day annual MHS Conference, hosted by the Office of the Assistant Secretary of Defense for Health Affairs, which convened to share knowledge, advance innovation, and highlight new initiatives within the MHS. In his closing remarks on May 1, Dr. Ferrara emphasized the quality of the stories and information shared to improve the health care of the warfighter, saying the conference was “moving and inspiring, and helped bring us back to the center of what the nature of our mission is all about.”",https://militarymedical.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/9004780.jpg,N,1.0,2025-05-20 14:56:37.654451

The work of the MHS Digital Transformation Executive Committee culminated in March 2025 with the publication of the premier MHS Digital Transformation Strategy.
The council is an integrator comprised of representatives from Health Affairs, USU, Defense Health Agency, and the military departments.
Dr. Christine Bader, an MHS Digital Policy Council member, said the MHS made digital transformation a priority because digital health modernization and innovation are seen as catalysts and enablers for change.","Digital transformation continues to have a significant impact on the way people live and work at a rapid pace, and its influence on health care is no exception. As artificial intelligence capabilities become more widespread and sophisticated, the Department of Defense will respond with agility and flexibility to advance its responsible adoption of AI. Over the past six years, the Office of the Assistant Secretary of Defense for Health Affairs has worked to identify the necessary actions to enable advances and adoption of AI and machine learning across military medicine, while ensuring robust strategy, policies, governance, and safeguards are in place.

The Military Health System fosters, protects, sustains, and restores the health of active duty and reserve component forces to support the mission. The MHS has a unique mission supporting 9.5 million beneficiaries composed of uniformed service members, military retirees, and family members. The MHS started an initial artificial intelligence and machine learning inventory in 2018.

In 2019, the MHS started hosting annual workshops specifically geared towards AI and machine learning. An updated inventory was performed in 2023. Since 2024, the MHS’ goal is to focus on strategy, collaboration, and establishing guidelines aligned with the policies of the DOD’s Chief Digital and Artificial Intelligence Office. Leveraging the Uniformed Services University of the Health Sciences was a natural fit to develop a strategic digital health framework for the MHS.

Digital health experts at USU were charged to lead development of this digital strategy beginning in December 2023. USU is the nation’s federal health professions academy with an emphasis on military health care, leadership, readiness, and public health. The work of the MHS Digital Transformation Executive Committee culminated in March 2025 with the publication of the premier MHS Digital Transformation Strategy. The strategy identifies four distinct lines of effort: invest in the existing digital health infrastructure; develop digital care models and empower digital self-care; develop a digitally competent medical workforce; and integrate AI and data management.

According to Dr. Stephen Ferrara, acting assistant secretary of defense for Health Affairs, the MHS Digital Transformation Strategy represents a commitment and “is a testament to our unwavering dedication to providing the full spectrum of advanced digital health technologies to improve health outcomes for our warfighters on the battlefield or in garrison and for their families to access person-centric, healthcare tools. It harnesses America’s innate and nearly infinite capacity to innovate, enabling us to drive and master the future.”

Digital transformation refers to the process of integrating digital technologies, data analytics, and innovative processes into healthcare delivery, aiming to significantly improve the quality, efficiency, and accessibility of medical services, often including elements like telehealth, electronic health records, and patient portals, allowing for more personalized and data-driven patient care.

Susan Orsega, deputy assistant secretary of defense for Health Services Policy and Oversight, said “digital transformation in health care has created a culture of innovation and change across the medical community, and the MHS is no different.”

“Our medical teams are working to understand how digital tools can positively impact our beneficiaries’ health and military mission success,” she said. “As we continue to traverse the future of military medicine, we know digital tools can have a great influence on access to care, better patient outcomes, disease diagnosis, and prevention at home and abroad.”

To bring the strategy to life and support implementation, Ferrara chartered the MHS Digital Policy Council in March 2025. Led by Orsega, the council provides strategic implementation, guidance, and oversight of data governance and AI policy and ensures all MHS health data integration and digital adoption activities are transparent, mutually supporting, and shared across the components of the MHS.

The scope of their oversight includes the safe, secure, and trustworthy development and use of AI within health care, the enhancement and acceleration of enterprise data management, and the review and monitoring of developing data analytic platforms. The council is an integrator comprised of representatives from Health Affairs, USU, Defense Health Agency, and the military departments.

Dr. Christine Bader, an MHS Digital Policy Council member, said the MHS made digital transformation a priority because digital health modernization and innovation are seen as catalysts and enablers for change.

“The integration of digital health offers opportunities to increase operational readiness, improve clinical outcomes, enhance quality and safety, reduce risks, and fortify the resilience of the total force and all DOD beneficiaries,” said Bader, who currently serves as deputy director of the General Ronald H. Griffith Institute for Military Medical Professionalism and special assistant to the dean of the Daniel K. Inouye Graduate School of Nursing at USU.

According to Allen W. Middleton, a senior advisor to the president of USU, transforming the MHS into a digital health force multiplier is not an option, but necessary to ensure mission success across the DOD.

“Failing to embrace digital transformation will hinder the MHS’s ability to effectively support the National Defense Strategy, deliver the joint capabilities needed by the armed services and combatant commands, and provide quality care to the total force and DOD beneficiaries,” said Middleton. “A tightly integrated system, critical to which is digital transformation, is essential for the MHS to remain effective. If the MHS does not evolve into a digital health system, it risks falling behind in providing optimal health care, potentially jeopardizing the health and readiness of military personnel and their families.”

USU President Dr. Jonathan Woodson understands the value of digital health and its benefit to patients—saving the lives of service members and getting them back to the fight as quickly as possible. But equally as important is transforming how future military doctors and nurses are learning and shortening training times through adaptive learning and digital tools.

“USU is harnessing cutting edge AI technologies to revolutionize medical education, optimizing learning efficiency, engagement, and exam performance,” said Woodson. “These AI-driven innovations enhance curriculum, personalize interactive tutoring, provide high-fidelity exam preparation and medical-interviewing simulations. I think we will be able to accomplish moving students through the curriculum in three years.”

The transformation of digital health will continue to drive success on the battlefield, in military hospitals and clinics, and in MHS training and education venues for the next decade and beyond. With the support of innovative leaders and forward-thinkers throughout the organization in healthcare delivery, operational medicine informatics and teaching those skills at USU and at military hospitals and clinics will ensure they have the tools necessary to support the health and operational medicine needs of tomorrow.",,N,1.0,2025-05-20 14:56:41.164827

The MSCE is designed to foster operational and strategic medical collaboration between allied nations working to address common health security challenges.

“MSCE is more than an exchange—it is a strategic platform to shape the future of multinational medical engagement,” said U.S. Army Col. Larry J. McCord, CENTCOM command surgeon. In the face of evolving health threats and increasing operational demands, he added, MSCE provides a critical, real-time opportunity to connect, exchange insights, and align efforts across the medical domain to promote interoperability and improve continuity of patient care. Throughout the event, McCord encouraged participants to actively explore how their collective experiences can advance interoperability, training, and health across the region.

“As the premier developer of combat medical solutions for the Department of Defense, OPMED greatly appreciated the opportunity to participate in this exchange,” said U.S. Army Col. Owen L. Roberts, OPMED’s program manager. “We are laser-focused on rapid, mission-driven innovation—delivering agile, user-informed capabilities that respond to the urgent needs of those we serve. The MSCE was an opportunity to foster enhanced regional partnerships.”

McCord opened the event by challenging the attendees with five major operational tasks for the CENTCOM AOR: Maximizing capabilities in limited resource environments by better leveraging partner nations to provide healthcare solutions; utilizing information technology and innovative solutions to improve survivability rates; enabling real-time digital visualization of medical assets, patient management, and medical logistics to allow commanders to make risk-informed decisions; effectively responding to the changing character of drone warfare; and improving how the Joint Force works with partner nations in strategically critical regions.

“It was especially critical for us to hear directly from CENTCOM about the operational challenges they face,” said Roberts. “OPMED, with the rest of the Joint Service medical enterprise, is dedicated to finding solutions to these problem sets. This includes equipping commanders with a medical common operating picture to enhance situational awareness and decision-making.”

Meeting discussions focused on prolonged care in austere and resource-limited environments, with an emphasis on novel oxygen-generating or whole blood solutions that provide additional capabilities above freeze-dried and frozen plasma, Roberts said. Another key topic was electronic warfare and the ability of adversaries to use drones to target known electronic signals. As new medical capabilities are fielded—particularly those that generate data—they must avoid creating unique electronic “fingerprints” that can rapidly become real-time targets.

The conversation also addressed a major operational pivot—the transition from human-led patient evacuation to drone-enabled and autonomous evacuation solutions, potentially combined with remote monitoring of patients. This shift is seen as critical to maintaining pace with evolving battlefield conditions and will require aggressive support.

According to Roberts, the MSCE discussions reinforced the paradigm shift to Large-Scale Combat Operations, with an emphasis on prolonged field care. This requires aligning investments with new medical capabilities that can be fielded within 24 to 36 months. Overall, the session set the tone for forward-looking innovation driven in part by OPMED’s public-private partnerships, with an emphasis on delivering “tomorrow’s technology, today’s solution.”

OPMED rapidly provides effective medical solutions for the Joint Force, focusing on tailored acquisition to meet Service needs. The aim is to enhance lethality and survivability while promoting sustainable function and mobility, all while ensuring adaptability and affordability in battlefield medicine.

Lovell Government Services will serve as a Recovery Force Health Service-Disabled Veteran-Owned Small Business (SDVOSB) vendor, distributing the company’s HeelP.O.D. pressure off-loading device to these customers through federal contracting systems.

Pressure injuries are one of the most prevalent and costly hospital-acquired conditions in the U.S. Sacral pressure injuries are the leading cause of hospital-acquired pressure injuries, with heel ulcers ranking as the second leading cause. Over 2.5 million patients in the U.S. suffer from pressure injuries annually, resulting in significant pain, increased infection risks, a higher workload for hospital staff, and increased healthcare costs. Pressure injuries cost the U.S. healthcare system an estimated $12 billion annually, and hospitals urgently need effective offloading solutions to improve patient outcomes and reduce costs.

HeelP.O.D. is a unique pressure offloading device with an ‘open-air’ design that provides visual assurance of offloading and conveinent access to the foot with skin checks, dressing changes, debridement and range of motion therapy. The device is made a memory foam material that uses immersion and envelopment technology to continuously offload and maximize pressure redistribution of bony prominences.

Earlier this year, Recovery Force Health acquired HeelP.O.D from NelDerm, solidifying the company’s commitment to providing innovative prevention solutions addressing the top causes of hospital-acquired pressure injuries.

As Recovery Force Health’s SDVOSB Vendor, Lovell is excited to bring this product to federal healthcare providers. Recovery Force Health is now available through the Department of Veterans Affairs' Federal Supply Schedule (FSS), GSA Advantage, the Defense Logistics Agency's Electronic Catalog (ECAT), and the Department of Defense's Distribution and Pricing Agreement (DAPA). Listing products on contract vehicles with Lovell streamlines the acquisition process while helping government agencies meet their SDVOSB procurement goals.

""We are proud to partner with Recovery Force Health to further our commitment to delivering first-class services to our veterans. This collaboration highlights our commitment to enhancing the lives of those who have served, ensuring they receive the top-quality care and support they deserve,"" said Chris Lovell, Major, USMC (Ret.), CEO of Lovell Government Services.

“We are pleased to announce our new partnership with Lovell Government Services. They have a legacy of serving our country and those who gave their service to our country, and it’s an honor to be a part of that,” said Chuck Young, Senior Director of Business Development. “HeelP.O.D. is a unique device for reducing heel pressure ulcers, and it also offers nursing staff an easy method of application, skin assessment and wound dressing changes. We’re confident that HeelP.O.D. will greatly impact the care and outcomes of our veterans.”

The Leapfrog Hospital Safety Grade program, updated twice a year, evaluates public and private hospitals.
""These latest grades should bolster our patients' confidence that they are receiving exceptional care at our military hospitals.""","The Defense Health Agency has announced that 16 military hospitals received an ""A"" rating in the latest Leapfrog Hospital Safety Grade assessment for Spring 2025. These high grades reflect the DHA's ongoing dedication to transparency and providing high-quality care to service members and their families.

The Leapfrog Group is a national, independent organization focused on health care quality. The organization evaluates hospitals on a wide range of safety measures, including errors, injuries and infections. Leapfrog's grading system uses up to 22 evidence-based measures of patient safety.

A hospital must meet specific criteria to be eligible for participation in the Leapfrog safety assessment. In the Spring 2025 ratings, 32% of participating hospitals nationwide received the highest grade. Of the eligible military hospitals participating in the grading assessment, 73% received an ""A"" grade.

""These most recent Leapfrog Safety Grades continue to validate DHA's commitment to meeting high standards for the patients we are privileged to serve,"" said Dr. Paul Cordts, DHA's deputy assistant director for medical affairs and chief medical officer. ""We are proud that the care provided at these facilities ranks among the very best in the nation.""

DHA's engagement with Leapfrog began about seven years ago when it sought to incorporate Leapfrog's evaluations into the Military Health System's Quality Assurance Program. Walter Reed National Military Medical Center was the first military test site for Leapfrog surveys. After seeing positive results, DHA expanded the program across other eligible military hospitals.

""Our participation in this program showcases the consistent rigor our teams apply to safe, effective health care delivery."" said Cordts. "" We are proud of our medical teams' effort to meet the quality and safety metrics that Leapfrog has set.""

The Leapfrog Hospital Safety Grade program, updated twice a year, evaluates public and private hospitals. Its grades are based on national standards for hospital safety and highlight risks that patients may face in a health care setting, including preventable medical errors and infections. The ratings are available to the public, making it easier for patients to understand the safety standards of their local health care facilities.

The 16 military hospitals that received an ""A"" grade in Spring 2025 are:

81st Medical Group, Keesler Air Force Base, Mississippi

673rd Medical Group, Joint Base Elmendorf-Richardson, Alaska

Alexander T. Augusta Military Medical Center, Fort Belvoir, Virginia

Blanchfield Army Community Hospital, Fort Campbell, Kentucky

Brooke Army Medical Center, Fort Sam Houston, Texas

Carl R. Darnall Army Medical Center, Fort Cavazos, Texas

Eisenhower Army Medical Center, Fort Eisenhower, Georgia

Evans Army Community Hospital, Fort Carson, Colorado

Madigan Army Medical Center, Joint Base Lewis-McChord, Washington

Martin Army Community Hospital, Fort Benning, Georgia

Naval Medical Center Camp Lejeune, Camp Lejeune, North Carolina

Naval Medical Center Portsmouth, Portsmouth, Virginia

Naval Medical Center San Diego, San Diego, California

Walter Reed National Military Medical Center, Bethesda, Maryland

William Beaumont Army Medical Center, Fort Bliss, Texas

U.S. Naval Hospital Guam, Guam

Some military hospitals were not included in the safety grades this spring because they did not meet the minimum requirements for reporting criteria used by Leapfrog. The DHA has instituted similar criteria internally to ensure patient safety for all facilities that did not qualify for official Leapfrog grades.

""We remain steadfast in our commitment to regular and transparent reporting about the quality of DHA's health care,"" said Cordts. ""These latest grades should bolster our patients' confidence that they are receiving exceptional care at our military hospitals.""",https://media.defense.gov/2025/May/20/2003718985/1280/1280/0/210423-F-PO640-9004R.JPG,N,1.0,2025-05-20 11:56:40.696995

""Brett Favre ultimately ruined my life.""
When does the Netflix documentary on Brett Favre air?","A new Netflix documentary, ""UNTOLD: The Fall of Favre,"" explores the multifaceted life and career of Brett Favre.

The film examines both Favre's football accomplishments and controversies, including allegations of inappropriate messages sent to Jenn Sterger.

While Favre did not participate in the documentary, Sterger alleges Favre's actions negatively impacted her life.

If you ask someone what they think of NFL Hall of Famer Brett Favre, you most likely will get a strong opinion. What that opinion might be depends on who you ask.

Whether it's the family man who married his high school sweetheart, father of two daughters or the talented athlete who broke tons of records and led the Green Bay Packers to a Super Bowl win, Favre is a no doubt a sports hero.

You might have spotted him in movies such as ""There's Something About Mary"" alongside Ben Stiller and Cameron Diaz or in ""Reggie's Prayer"" or any number of commercials, including for Wrangler jeans, Right Guard deodorant or Prilosec.

But then there's the other side. Jenn Sterger, who worked for the New York Jets at the same time Favre was on the team, alleges Favre sent her text messages, some of which included explicit photos.

The many sides of Favre are explored in a new Netflix documentary about the star athlete, taking him from his early days of football with father, Irvin, and at the University of Southern Mississippi to today and the shadows that cloud his shining star.

Netflix's ""UNTOLD: The Fall of Favre,"" directed by Rebecca Gitlitz, gives an in-depth look at the public figure, exploring his football career as well as some of the controversies that surround him, the most recent of which is the Mississippi welfare fraud scandal.

While he has never been accused of a crime, he received more than $1 million for speaking engagements that never materialized. Favre returned the money, but he is a party in a civil lawsuit connected with the case. Favre denies any wrongdoing.

Add to that the investments in and campaigns for Prevacus, which was supposed to produce a miracle concussion drug, and World Health Industries, producer of RxPro, another miracle drug, this for pain relief. It turns out, the pain cream scheme was a fraud that resulted in more than $1.5 billion in losses to TRICARE and other health care benefit providers.

The fraud eventually sent dozens to prison. As an investor, however, Favre was not a party to the fraud itself, and was never charged with any crimes connected to it.

You get the drift. While Favre may be a superhero on the field, he is also a man, like any other.

The tone for the documentary is set right away with an appearance by Michael Vick, another star quarterback whose star was tarnished by choices he made off-field. While Vick was able to overcome his past and return to coach college football, the shadow remains.

Gitlitz said in an interview with the Hattiesburg American and Clarion Ledger that she wanted to show people that there is more than one side to a person, and some of those sides can be complex.

What are the highlights of the Favre documentary?

The documentary focuses heavily on Sterger and the controversy surrounding her connection with Favre. It shows Sterger's rise to fame up to the point when the infamous text messages began rolling in.

Sterger said when the news broke about the texts, her life was ruined. She says she's not the only one who was affected by the radiation surrounding Favre's star.

""We get left in the wake because we were never the story,"" Sterger said in the documentary. ""Brett Favre ultimately ruined my life.""

There are other familiar faces in the documentary, including U.S. Congressman Bennie Thompson and longtime sports columnist Rick Cleveland.

Favre himself, although the center of the documentary, did not give an interview, nor did any of the people closest to him, despite attempts made by Gitlitz and her team.

The director said the documentary isn't just about Favre and Sterger or Favre and football.

There are many aspects Gitlitz explored, including how other people are impacted by Favre, whether it is to be in awe of his football skills, adore him as a family man or question his character because of his connections and the allegations made against him.

""There are numerous narratives that needed to be unpacked here, so I really meant for all sides of the story (to be told),"" Gitlitz said. ""You cannot take away from what Brett Favre did on the field. I wouldn't want to take away that he was a charismatic guy. I think that it's OK for two things to exist at the same time.""

When does the Netflix documentary on Brett Favre air?

""Untold, the Fall of Favre"" is according to Netflix an ""eye-opening documentary"" that ""delves into Brett Favre's controversial career, the dark side of sports stardom and the scandals that marred his legacy.""

It airs on the streaming service starting Tuesday, May 20 at 2 a.m. Central time.","https://www.hattiesburgamerican.com/gcdn/authoring/authoring-images/2025/05/17/PHAT/83693281007-untold-the-fall-of-favre-ss-12287177-b.jpg?crop=2011,1131,x0,y300&width=2011&height=1131&format=pjpg&auto=webp",N,0.0,2025-05-20 03:56:18.272672

And I think President Trump has a great place to start by supporting our bill to expand IVF coverage for military families.","NEWYou can now listen to Fox News articles!

Today, May 19, 2025, is the deadline for policy recommendations on ways to implement President Donald Trump’s executive order to expand access to in vitro fertilization (IVF) and lower its costs. And while his administration is currently contemplating some bizarre and patronizing ways to raise birth rates, like baby bonuses and motherhood awards, my suggestion is to support military families who desperately want to grow their families.

I’m incredibly proud to represent San Diego, the biggest military community in the country, which is home to 110,000 active-duty service members and more than 118,000 of their family members. So, I hear all the time about their lives and their struggles to pay rent and put food on the table, their inability to find reliable childcare, their concerns about their safety, and their journeys with infertility.

For example, a senior-enlisted sailor, Matt, shared with me that he and his wife Jenny had two daughters via IVF – after five miscarriages, seven frozen embryo transfers, 600 shots and spending $80,000.

PRO-LIFE LEADERS URGE TRUMP TO REVERSE HIS IVF STAND, SAY THE TECHNOLOGY IS 'NOT PRO-LIFE'

About a quarter of active-duty service members and military spouses report infertility, which is double the national average of the general population. When we think about the level of sacrifices we’re asking from our military families, their struggles with infertility make sense.

Our service members endure physically intensive training, demanding schedules, and frequent relocations during their prime reproductive years. Deployments are often long and stressful, where they’re physically separated from their partner, which also takes an emotional toll. On top of that, military service also means living and working in hazardous environments that can negatively impact fertility.

Despite all of these well-documented stressors, TRICARE, the country’s military health insurance plan, only covers fertility services for those who can prove a service connection to injury or illness, which is often impossible to do. This leaves our military families with three realistic options: pay tens of thousands of dollars out-of-pocket for a chance at a family, forgo having children or leave the military altogether.

The cost-of-living crisis is affecting everyone in our country, but especially military families, many of whom live on fixed incomes and struggle to afford childcare, housing and food on the table. This isn’t a demographic that can easily afford tens of thousands of dollars out-of-pocket on anything, so folks are leaving the military for this coverage, worsening our recruitment and retention challenges and impacting our military readiness.

FLASHBACK: TRUMP SEEKS TO EXPAND FERTILITY COVERAGE, AFTER TIM WALZ ONCE ACCUSED HIM OF BEING ‘ANTI-IVF’

Military families need IVF access. They deserve it. And they’ve earned it. That’s why I introduced the ""IVF for Military Families Act"" alongside Illinois Democrat Senator Tammy Duckworth to require TRICARE to cover infertility diagnosis and treatment, including IVF. Our legislation would cover up to three complete egg retrievals, unlimited embryo transfers, and the necessary medications for IVF and intrauterine insemination (IUI).

CLICK HERE FOR MORE FOX NEWS OPINION

Starting this year, members of Congress and our staff have access to comprehensive infertility treatment, including IVF coverage, just like many other civilian employees in the federal and private sectors. We shouldn’t have access to benefits that our military families don’t have. But despite this hypocrisy, our bill still lacks support from my Republican colleagues in both the House and Senate.

I’m (obviously) skeptical of Trump’s commitment to expanding IVF access, but he has called himself the ""Fertilization President"" and the ""father of IVF."" If he wants that to be true, he should throw his support behind a demographic that has already sacrificed so much for the safety and security of our country: our military families.

NASCAR STAR'S WIFE THANKS TRUMP FOR IVF EXECUTIVE ORDER: 'STEP FORWARD'

Expanding TRICARE coverage of IVF could be the watershed moment needed to change the entire market and ensure that everyone in our country has access to IVF. It could put market pressure on private insurers to include IVF and other fertility treatments in their healthcare coverage plans so they remain competitive.

This leaves our military families with three realistic options: pay tens of thousands of dollars out-of-pocket for a chance at a family, forgo having children or leave the military altogether.

While the IVF for Military Families Act would be a monumental step forward, the ultimate goal is for everyone to have access to the full range of reproductive care, so they have the power and the ability to decide when and if to have children.

We ask so much from our service members – to risk their safety, to be apart from their families, and to give up certain freedoms – but we shouldn’t ask them to give up their opportunity to build a family. As a country, we need to do more than say we value our military community, we need to actually show it. And I think President Trump has a great place to start by supporting our bill to expand IVF coverage for military families.",https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2025/02/ap25056812814521.jpg,N,0.0,2025-05-20 03:56:21.881420

All counties are affected.

To receive an emergency refill of prescription medications, TRICARE beneficiaries should take their prescription bottle to any TRICARE retail network pharmacy. If the bottle is unavailable or the label is damaged or missing, beneficiaries should contact Express Scripts, Inc., or their retail network pharmacy for assistance.

To find a network pharmacy, beneficiaries may call Express Scripts at 1-877-363-1303, or search the network pharmacy locator.

If possible, visit the pharmacy where the prescription was filled. Prescriptions filled by a retail chain may be filled at another store in that chain. If the clinician who prescribed the medication is available, beneficiaries can ask them to call in a new prescription to any network pharmacy.

As a reminder, TRICARE beneficiaries, other than active duty service members, may receive urgent care from any TRICARE-authorized urgent care center or provider and do not need a referral. This allows beneficiaries to seek nonemergency care for illnesses or injuries if their primary care provider is unavailable because of emergencies. Any TRICARE beneficiary who reasonably believes they have an emergency should always call 911 or, go to the nearest emergency room.

Beneficiaries are advised to visit Express Scripts’ Weather Notices page for updates.

###

The Defense Health Agency provides health services to 9.5 million beneficiaries, including uniformed service members, military retirees, and their families.

Active-duty family members, retirees and their eligible family members who live in Atlanta or Tampa, Florida, will have a new option for health care next year: Tricare Prime managed by CareSource Military and Veterans.

The nonprofit organization was awarded a contract in 2024 to run a three-year demonstration project to provide Tricare Prime, the Defense Department's managed care-style health program, to more than 146,000 eligible beneficiaries in the two cities, beginning in 2026.

The new agreement, which will run through 2029, gives another health care option for military beneficiaries and allows the Defense Health Agency to evaluate having other health care entities manage portions of the Tricare patient load alongside Humana Government Business, which holds the Tricare East Region contract.

""Tricare Prime Atlanta and Tricare Prime Tampa represent an innovative approach to advance access to care, enhance the patient experience, and strive for better health outcomes,"" Dr. David Krulak, director of the Tricare Health Plan at the DHA, said in a statement May 7. ""The data we get from this demonstration will inform future Tricare innovations nationwide.""

Atlanta previously served as a test bed for a three-year Tricare Prime pilot run by Humana and Kaiser Permanente, the nonprofit considered to be a pioneer in health maintenance organization programs.

That program, which ended in 2022, sought to determine whether the DHA could provide ""value-based care"" -- a health system that pays providers based on performance, quality and value as opposed to volume.

Atlanta was home to the Army's Fort McPherson until 2011 when it was closed as part of the Pentagon's 2005 Base Realignment and Closure effort. When it closed, nearly 30,000 military retirees and their families lived in the area, and Georgia has become an increasingly popular retirement state for military personnel.

Tampa is the home of U.S. Central Command and MacDill Air Force Base, with roughly 34,000 military dependents and 133,000 retirees, according to Defense Department data.

Interested patients will be able to enroll in the new Tricare Prime option during open season, which runs from early November through early December. During open season, beneficiaries can switch between Tricare programs such as Prime or Select or unique plans offered in various locations.

CareSource is a managed-care and health insurance organization that provides programs and services to 2 million people. After receiving the Tricare Prime program contract last November, the company's chief executive officer said the new programs are intended to increase access to care for Tricare Prime beneficiaries and provide personalized support.

""We are honored to be entrusted with this vital responsibility,"" CareSource CEO Erhardt Preitauer said in a statement. ""Our team is dedicated to delivering a health plan that will provide military families with access to high-quality care that is uniquely tailored to their needs.""

Families of active-duty personnel who use Tricare Prime pay no annual enrollment fees, cost-shares or copayments. Retirees and their family members on Tricare Prime pay an annual enrollment fee, which, for most retirees, was $372 for an individual and $744 for a family in 2025.

Those beneficiaries also pay a $25 copay for a primary care visit, $38 per specialty care or urgent care visit, and $77 for an emergency room visit.

Defense Department spokesman Peter Graves said that the new programs are in addition to the Tricare health care programs already available in both cities, including existing military treatment facilities as well as Tricare Prime and Select managed by Humana.
