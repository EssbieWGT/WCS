The purpose of the survey by The Joint Commission is to evaluate the compliance of NHB and outlying branch clinics with nationally established Joint Commission, Defense Health Agency and Navy Medicine standards of care specific to the needs of patients, including infection prevention and control, leadership, and medication management.

The inspection is conducted approximately every three years at Defense Health Agency and U.S. Navy military treatment facilities with the survey results used to determine whether, and conditions under which, accreditation should be awarded to the command.

By becoming an accredited organization, NHB enhances community confidence, provides a report card for the public, offers an objective evaluation of the organization’s performance, stimulates the organization’s quality improvement efforts, aids in professional staff recruitment, and provides a staff education tool.

An independent, not-for-profit organization, The Joint Commission accredits and certifies more than 20,000 health care organizations and programs in the United States. Joint Commission accreditation and certification is recognized nationwide as a symbol of quality that reflects an organization's commitment to meeting certain performance standards.

By asking for accreditation, NHB agrees to be measured against national standards set by health care professionals. An accredited organization substantially complies with Joint Commission standards and continuously makes efforts to improve the care and service provided.

TJC standards deal with organizational quality of care issues and the safety of the environment in which care is provided. TJC survey team usually consists of specially trained physicians, nurses, administrators and a facilities expert. The surveyors will evaluate NHB’s compliance with established standards and identify strengths and weaknesses.

The overall goal is not merely to find problems, but also to provide education and consultation so health care organizations can improve.

First-Place Awards, Top Spot in Prestigious Categories

MHS civilians earned first place in eight categories, with Douglas Stutz at Naval Hospital Bremerton taking first for best information story about U.S. Navy Lt. Jane W. Njenga ensuring forces are medically ready when facing tropical diseases.

“We’ve had the honor to cover less-than-ideal subjects which still needed to be shared, including suicide and remembering loss on Memorial Day. Njenga’s commitment in the Military Tropical Medical Program offered us the opportunity to share how investing the time and effort can help save lives in future conflicts,” said Stutz.

When asked what drove him to enter the competition, Stutz said, “We submitted content to help highlight and hopefully increase focus on our valued Navy Medicine team of Navy Medical Corps, Medical Service Corps, Nurse Corps, Dental Corps, and especially our enlisted Hospital Corps and our support staff. Every one of them is a subject matter expert. They may not openly realize it, but we believe that each of our staff has a tremendous amount of value and insight to tap into, helping to share who, what, where, when, and why we do our work.”

Additional winners included Bernard Little from Walter Reed National Military Medical Center who won the prestigious Civilian Writer of the Year award, while Jorge Gomez from Irwin Army Community Hospital was named Civilian Videographer of the Year.

“I’m honored to have been recognized as the Civilian Writer of the Year among a very talented group of writers,” said Little. “I want people to know that the staff and care at Walter Reed is second to none. I want people to read the stories that I write and consider coming to Walter Reed for their care if they don’t. For those who do, I want them to feel pleased they are receiving their care here and continue to receive their care here, feeling secure and confident that they are receiving the best care anywhere.”

Brandon Henry from the Uniformed Services University won two top prizes—first place in both animation and multimedia product categories. Thomas Balfour, also from USU, won first place for his featured photo.

The university is no stranger to these achievements. “We’re very proud of the incredible talent we have here at USU,” said Sharon Holland, acting vice president for external affairs and director of alumni affairs. “Our writers, graphic designers, photographers, and multimedia staff have consistently been recognized for their work, either at the local level, the MHS level, the Department of Defense level, and sometimes all three. We’re thrilled to be part of a community that values excellence in telling the military health story.”

In similar categories, Thomas Cieslak from Naval Health Clinic Cherry Point won first in photojournalism, and Justin Moeller from Blanchfield Army Community Hospital took first in the picture story category.

Not only did MHS lead the competition with the most first-place wins, MHS secured the most second and third place finishes of any agency.

Honoring Creativity and Impact While Advancing Mission Readiness

The awards recognize communications professionals for more than just the quality of their products. They are honored for their role in advancing warfighter readiness and telling the military health story in creative, meaningful ways, said Richard H. Breen Jr., director of communications and public affairs for the Office of the Assistant Secretary of Defense for Health Affairs and the Military Health System. “The work of the MHS is beyond health care–it’s about ensuring that every service member is fit to fight, that our medical teams are trained and ready, and that our families receive the care they deserve. The awards capture the essence of this mission in one article, frame, photo, or video.”

“Winning or placing in any category at the DMMA is a testament to the MHS team’s creativity, precision, and ability to translate complex health topics into messages that resonate across the force,” said Derik W. Crotts, communication strategist with the MHS. “Their work directly supports warfighter readiness by ensuring the right information reaches the right people at the right time.”

Karen Roberts, director of the Defense Health Agency Director’s Communications and Public Affairs Division, agrees. “These communicators represent DHA’s deep well of talent and the commitment shared by all of our communication professionals who work hard to highlight the high-quality health care our military hospitals and clinics deliver to millions of service members, retirees, and their families,” she said.",https://militarymedical.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/8819337.jpg,N,1.0,2025-04-21 15:57:06.122796

The New York Times: Trump Aides Solicit Ideas To Raise Birthrate, From Baby Bonuses To Fertility Planning

The White House has been hearing out a chorus of ideas in recent weeks for persuading Americans to get married and have more children, an early sign that the Trump administration will embrace a new cultural agenda pushed by many of its allies on the right to reverse declining birthrates and push conservative family values. One proposal shared with aides would reserve 30 percent of scholarships for the Fulbright program, the prestigious, government-backed international fellowship, for applicants who are married or have children. Another would give a $5,000 cash “baby bonus” to every American mother after delivery. (Kitchener, 4/21)

The Washington Post: CDC Cuts Hamstring Programs That Monitor Fertility And Maternal Health

Federal programs that help people compare IVF clinics, monitor safety in fertility and make sense of health data have been scaled back by the Trump administration in a move some maternal health experts predict will have an enduring effect on women and children. Layoffs at the Department of Health and Human Services this month have dismantled teams at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention responsible for collecting and analyzing data on a range of subjects, including embryo transfers and maternal health disparities.

Faced with a crushing out-of-pocket cost, she left. (Chan, 4/18)

Public, private and charter schools in Iowa would be required to show fetal development videos to students starting in fifth grade under a bill passed Thursday by Republicans in the Iowa House.

TRICARE is the health program for members of the U.S. military, veterans, and their families.
In Puerto Rico, it is administered through the TRICARE Overseas Program.
Of particular interest is TRICARE Prime, a managed care option within the TRICARE health care program, primarily available in specific Prime Service Areas (PSAs).
It’s worth noting that when the Philippines gained independence from the United States, veterans who had fought in the U.S. military lost their veterans’ benefits.","Puerto Rico Resident Commissioner Pablo José Hernández has re-introduced the TRICARE Equality Act. The legislative proposal, also introduced by Jenniffer Gonzalez-Colon in 2021 and then again in 2023, seeks to improve health benefits available to veterans living in Puerto Rico. Cosponsors of the 2025 bill include House Veterans Affairs Health Subcommittee lead Democrat Rep. Julia Brownley (CA), as well as Reps. Eleanor Holmes Norton (D-DC), and Hank Johnson (D-GA).

“Our veterans and military families in Puerto Rico have sacrificed just as much as their counterparts on the mainland, and they deserve equal access to the healthcare benefits they’ve earned,” said Hernández.

“The TRICARE Equality Act will help close the unacceptable gaps in care faced by our servicemembers, retirees, and their families on the island. By improving TRICARE Prime access, expanding travel benefits, and ensuring better coordination of health data, this bill takes a critical step toward treating Puerto Rico’s military community with the dignity and fairness they deserve.”

What is TRICARE?

TRICARE is the health program for members of the U.S. military, veterans, and their families. In Puerto Rico, it is administered through the TRICARE Overseas Program. Unfortunately, the benefits for residents of Puerto Rico do not match those in the states. Veterans on the Island often must pay for services upfront and wait for reimbursement, or even travel to a state for medical services.

Of particular interest is TRICARE Prime, a managed care option within the TRICARE health care program, primarily available in specific Prime Service Areas (PSAs). Prime members are assigned a Primary Care Manager (PCM) who coordinates most of their healthcare. Out of pocket costs are lower with Prime, and travel benefits cover the cost of travel to military healthcare facilities. The TRICARE Overseas Program is similar, but not equal to the Prime benefits.

What does the TRICARE Equality Act provide?

The TRICARE Equality Act calls for PSAs to be established in Puerto Rico as they are in the states — on the basis of the proximity of military medical care facilities such as those at Ft. Buchanan. It also calls for service members, veterans, and their families to have travel benefits as they would if they lived in a state.

The bill also mandates coordination between the Federal Electronic Health Record Modernization Office and the Department of Health of Puerto Rico to share health information through the Joint Health Information Exchange.

Why is there inequity?

The Supreme Court has repeatedly ruled that Congress can treat territories differently from states, and the differences in veterans’ benefits are examples of this freedom. Although Puerto Rican veterans can access the full range of U.S. Veterans Affairs (VA) benefits if they are living stateside, VA benefits for veterans living in the U.S. territory are less generous.

It’s worth noting that when the Philippines gained independence from the United States, veterans who had fought in the U.S. military lost their veterans’ benefits. Similarly, veterans of the U.S. military living in the U.S. freely associated states (FAS) of Palau, the Marshall Islands and Federated States of Micronesia were legally excluded from receiving VA healthcare in the FAS until last year; although veterans’ healthcare is now authorized within their borders, the programs have yet to be implemented.

These facts are in contrast to the optimistic ideas of separatists who claim that veterans would continue to receive their health benefits if Puerto Rico were to become a sovereign nation, or the small but vocal group of independence supporters living stateside who do not need to worry about the practical implications for U.S. veterans in Puerto Rico if the U.S.-Puerto Rico connection is severed.",https://i0.wp.com/puertoricoreport.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Untitled-design-742.png?fit=1920%2C1280&ssl=1,N,0.0,2025-04-21 11:56:33.824470

If you have a contraindication like an interaction with another medicine- then the doctor can discuss is in the form and it shouldn’t be an issue.
I took ONE dose- had the most horrible reactions (racing heart, dizziness, irritability, etc etc) from ONE dose I told them not taking it again.
Not that you should have to endure a possible horrible reaction to get approved… but it’s how mine was approved.
So, a fairly unique circumstance, but ultimately they approved me for it without having to take the oral meds.","It’s all up to how the PA is filled out by your doctor. Express Scripts is super nice and helpful and I talked them extensively during my PA process because my doctors office kept filling out the forms wrong 😡😡. Bring the form into your doctor and discuss in person if you can, have them fill it out in front you and ask for a copy too. If you have a contraindication like an interaction with another medicine- then the doctor can discuss is in the form and it shouldn’t be an issue.

Side note- I used to be on antidepressants and anti anxiety’s a long time ago, but stopped taking them after I had kids (no good reason not to restart other than I was being stubborn). I’ve struggled for years off my meds, and Zep has made me feel new again. True happiness I haven’t felt in a long time. I’m not as irritable. Not as sad. More good days ❤️ Good luck with your journey!

Also- just in case…. I technically had contraindications to Qsymia/phentermine and was super adamant about not trying it. I went to an obesity specialist, who was not very kind and literally wanted to hear nothing about my contraindications concerns, and adamantly prescribed me Phentermine. I took ONE dose- had the most horrible reactions (racing heart, dizziness, irritability, etc etc) from ONE dose I told them not taking it again. I went back to my other doctor and told them my reactions. That counted as me trying and failing it for the sake of the form and my Zep PA was approved no problem after that. Not that you should have to endure a possible horrible reaction to get approved… but it’s how mine was approved.

I have TriCare as well and was able to get a PA without trying phentermine or the others. I had just worked with med management to get my adhd and anxiety under control for about a year and am on a stimulant, so i expressed my desires to my PCM that I didn’t want to get off of it because I was finally starting to feel good (you can’t take phentermine while on other stimulants). I also have a history of seizures, so I can’t take the other 2. So, a fairly unique circumstance, but ultimately they approved me for it without having to take the oral meds.

I have Tricare for life so I’m a bit older than you are and it was not a hard process at all. I know that the regulation state that you have to try three medication’s prior to going on Zepbound, but since my doctor had known me for the last 20 years and knew what I had been going through, he just zipped right through it and said I tried them all failed them and needed to go on Zepbound.Not sure if your doctor will do this for you or not but if you have to go through the steps, then do it. As far as your mother saying that it is a risky medicine, as a nurse I can tell you that all medications can be risky. But GLP ones have been out for over 20 years and the science is there to back it up. Now some people are going to get side effects, some get it real bad, and others don’t have a problem whatsoever. I was one of the lucky ones that had side effects from day one and I am now starting my 16th month and I still have nausea most days. But I look at it this way. The medication is working therefore I have side effects. I would worry if I didn’t have side effects but that’s just me. You can tell your mom what good this drug does, though for people. I no longer have to take blood pressure medicine, cholesterol medicine, thyroid medicine, and I’m off of two of my atrial fib medication’s. I no longer am prediabetic, I no longer have sleep apnea either. I’m no longer at risk for 14 types of cancer that obese people get. I can run up and down the stairs after my granddaughters. I can walk across the room now without being short of breath. after 15 months on this miracle drug, I have lost 91 pounds. I am still considered overweight by another 15 pounds but that’s OK with me. Do I really wanna get back to what I was when I was 22 years old? I like who I am now in this body. I went from a size 22/24 to now a size 12. i’m not in maintenance yet as I would like to continue trying to lose some more weight. We are going on a cruise in a month and we’ll see what happens on that cruise. I am happy to say that my food noise is still being controlled and I have to remind myself sometimes to eat. But hunger is a good thing. now I find myself saying hey I’m hungry. I’m gonna try to eat this. And I may only eat half of it and again that’s OK. I’m sorry you don’t have a support of your mom that can be tough. I have a loving husband and two sons and three grandchildren that are cheering me on daily. Now my granddaughter did ask me if everything‘s going to change about me because she’s seen the change over the last 15 months. I told her that my heart will never change for her just the fat around it. I wish you the best of luck on this journey. Should you decide to take it. It is life-changing in so many aspects.

As NBC reports, Tricare - a lifelong benefit promised to many who serve, but one that has been plagued by widespread disruptions to service members, their families and the physicians who accept the insurance following a change in contracts.

Women across the country are speaking out about delays and denials of basic maternity because of improperly working Tricare.

NBC News collected numerous stories.

In Kansas City, at least two medical providers were telling Audrey Simmons they couldn’t see her because of ongoing negotiations with her insurance, leaving her with limited options during her high-risk pregnancy.

Then she found out that many others were in the same situation.

Marine Corps Sgt. Savannah Harper, 27, had trouble getting prenatal care in January after she transferred from a California base to one in Hawaii. She repeatedly called Tricare for help, enduring wait times of up to 90 minutes with no resolution - all leading to a full month overdue for her 20-week ultrasound.

Another issue is Tricare demanding repayment of previously paid claims. In Nevada, a Navy veteran and his wife said Tricare had rescinded over $100,000 in medical claims it had approved and paid years ago, NBC reports.

The result of Tricare so far: Missed diagnoses, confusion, stress, and unnecessary financial burdens. Our service members and veterans deserve better.

We call on the Defense Health Agency to fix Tricare coverage immediately. Ensure military families get timely, standard care without bureaucratic red tape.

Stop letting down the very people who served this country.

Top 10 Nutrition Habits to be a Readiness CHAMP: 1.
Know Your Why The most important step in changing your nutrition habits is to clearly understand why you want that behavior to change.
CHAMP’s Strategic Habits for Better Nutrition worksheet helps guide you to optimal nutrition goals—and it includes how to stay motivated and committed in changing your habits.
• Identify the nutrition habits you want to focus on.","The Consortium for Health and Military Performance at the University of Uniformed Services, otherwise known as CHAMP, provides human performance resources for warfighters to maintain an optimal healthy lifestyle.

CHAMP features ways to achieve optimal readiness through a combination of psychological, social, nutritional, spiritual, and physical fitness tools—including a focus on one area that plays a critical connection between food and readiness: nutrition, which can have many benefits on mission readiness for service members and their families.

""We now know that body strength, weight, and overall functioning are the result of biological, psychological, and environmental factors,” said Dr. Marian Tanofsky-Kraff, director of Developmental Research Laboratory on Eating & Weight Behaviors for USU. “Good nutrition and physical activity can supplement physical and emotional health.""

Nutrition is vital to mission readiness. Food provides the human body with the continuous supply of energy it needs to function efficiently. This demand increases significantly when engaging in physical activities, whether for recreational, competitive, or duty purposes.

As one of the most important drivers of optimal physical and psychological wellbeing, “proper nutrition gives your brain the nutrients it needs to manage stress, regulate mood and emotions, maintain alertness and optimize physical and cognitive performance—all essential components of mission readiness,” according to military health experts. “Eating healthy keeps you sharp mentally and fueled physically. This is especially important when facing increased stress or high operational tempo.”

The CHAMP site maintains dozens of resources on nutrition basics and specialty topics to enhance warfighter performance during workouts, training, missions, and recovery.

Top 10 Nutrition Habits to be a Readiness CHAMP:

1. Know Your Why

The most important step in changing your nutrition habits is to clearly understand why you want that behavior to change.

CHAMP’s Strategic Habits for Better Nutrition worksheet helps guide you to optimal nutrition goals—and it includes how to stay motivated and committed in changing your habits. The form contains questions to assess your current nutritional intake, organized in three steps:

• Identify the “why” behind the behavior you want to change.

• Identify the nutrition habits you want to focus on. As your habits evolve and improve, revisit the worksheet to choose new habits to work on.

• Create your strategy. The worksheet contains ways to develop habits to promote nutritional fitness.

2. Value Whole Foods

Focus on whole foods, and fewer processed foods. Choose more plants, the more colors the better for foods with naturally occurring nutrients.

For more on plant-forward eating, and to view sample menus and food swaps see CHAMP’s Go for Green Power Your Menu with Plants toolkit.

3. Time Meals

Follow a regular eating pattern and plan your nutrition strategy ahead of time. Avoid skipping meals or going too long without eating. Fuel before, during, and after exercise.

4. Understand Macronutrients

Energy primarily comes from three macronutrients, and each plays a distinct role in sustaining performance and aiding recovery. Aim to get a balance of these nutrients each day.

The three main macronutrients are:

• Carbohydrates: The body's main energy source, carbohydrates break down into sugars to provide immediate energy. Complex carbohydrates—as opposed to simple carbs in candy, soda, fruit juice, or sports drinks—are preferred as they are digested slowly and release steady supply of energy. They are found in whole-grains, beans, starchy vegetables, and fresh fruit. If you’re eating bread, cereal, tortillas, or pasta, whole-grain options are much healthier.

• Fats: Essential for a balanced diet, fats supply fat-soluble vitamins (A, D, E, and K), which are important for performance and recovery. Examples of fats include avocado, butter, and olive oil.

• Proteins: Found in every cell, protein is crucial for muscle repair and recovery. Sources of protein include chicken, lean beef, low-fat milk, and Greek yogurt.

5. Appreciate Omega-3

Omega-3 fatty acids support the health of your heart and blood vessels, nerves, eyes, brain, and immune system and may improve physical and mental performance. For example, omega-3s are being studied for the positive effects they might have in recovery from exercise and injury, as well as their role in protecting the brain and nervous system after a concussion or traumatic brain injury.

Find out which foods are highest in Omega-3 Content and how much you need from CHAMP.

6. Create Power Plates

CHAMP recommends a power plate guide to meet the nutritional requirements of the unique occupational and training demands of service members.

Power Plate Guide recommendations include:

• Make one-fourth of your plate lean protein.

• Make one-fourth to one-half of your plate natural and whole-grain carbohydrates.

• Aim for one-fourth to one-half of your plate to be non-starchy vegetables.

• Aim for one thumb-size portion of unsaturated fat.

• Stay hydrated.

• Eat mindfully.

7. Calculate Hydration

Water is the most abundant component of the human body—around 50–70% of its weight—so your body requires fluids regularly to ensure its normal function.

Given the unique nutritional requirements of Warfighters, the general fluid guidelines in the military are:

• Men: 96–144 oz daily (12–18 cups)

• Women: 64–96 oz daily (8–12 cups)

For more about daily fluid guidelines and how to tell if you’re at risk of dehydration see CHAMP’s Basic Hydration Strategies article.

8. Know What to Limit

The relationship between nutrition and mental health has grown in recent years. Studies show that certain foods may be used to prevent and treat conditions like depression.

Foods that cause inflammation and disrupt your “gut microbiota” may impact your mental well-being.

To get smart on what foods to limit or avoid and what foods to eat more of, see CHAMP’s Food and Mood: Does diet affect depression? article.

9. Choose More Plants

The benefits of vegetarian diets are linked to a lower risk of many chronic diseases, including heart disease, diabetes, and cancer.

To learn about the benefits of vegetarian diets and how to make sure you still get the right amount of key nutrients your body needs while on active duty, read CHAMP’s What you need to know about vegetarian diets article.

10. Track Food Intake

Knowing what you consume and how much you eat each day is a simple way to take charge of your eating habits. Consider starting a food journal or using food-diary apps to monitor your daily diet and improve your nutrition.

Several free apps are available like USDA’s MyPlate App.

While most of these cases are in Texas and New Mexico, cases have been rising across the country.

Anyone who isn’t protected against measles can get the illness—and children are especially at risk of getting seriously sick. You may be wondering how to keep your family safe.

“Measles is more than just a rash; it can lead to severe illness, and it’s extremely contagious—you can catch it just from being in the same room as an infected person,” explained Dr. Eric Deussing, Public Health Emergency Officer for the Defense Health Agency. “So, it’s important to take steps to keep you and your loved ones protected and learn how to recognize potential symptoms. Two doses of the measles, mumps, and rubella, or MMR, vaccine provide the best protection against measles.”

Here’s what you need to know.

What is measles?

Measles is a highly contagious illness that can cause serious complications. It spreads through the air when an infected person coughs or sneezes—sometimes, this happens up to four days before they’re even showing symptoms.

People of any age can get serious cases of measles. But the following groups are at increased risk for complications:

Children younger than age 5

Adults older than age 20

Pregnant women

People with weakened immune systems

Recognizing measles signs and symptoms

Measles symptoms usually appear between seven and 14 days after infection.

Initial symptoms typically include:

High fever (sometimes above 104 degrees)

Cough

Runny nose

Red, watery eyes

Two to three days after the start of symptoms, you may see tiny white spots (Koplik spots) in your mouth.

In three to five days, you may develop the measles rash—flat red spots that usually start on the face, and then spread down the body towards the feet.

Common complications of measles are ear infections and diarrhea. More severe complications can include pneumonia, swelling of the brain, and other conditions that can lead to hospitalization.

Are you or a family member showing signs of measles? Call the Military Health System Nurse Advice Line at 800-TRICARE (874-2273). Describe your symptoms to a registered nurse, who can advise you on what to do next.

Preventing measles

Your best defense against measles is getting vaccinated. Most people who got their vaccination have protection against measles for life, as described by the CDC.

The measles, mumps, and rubella, or MMR, vaccine protects against measles as well as mumps and rubella. This vaccine is available to those older than 12 months old.

The measles, mumps, rubella, and varicella, or MMRV, vaccine protects against these illnesses as well as chickenpox. This vaccine is only available to children 12 months old through 12 years old.

Both the MMR and MMRV vaccines are administered in two doses. Children under age 12 should get the first dose between 12 and 15 months old, and the second between 4 and 6 years old. (Children may also get the MMRV second dose three months after the first dose.)

Older children, teenagers, and adults should get one or two doses of the MMR vaccine if they don’t have evidence of immunity. (Note: You’re considered immune if you were born before 1957, since it’s likely you were infected naturally.) Doses should be given at least 28 days apart.

TRICARE covers age-appropriate doses of these vaccines, as recommended by the CDC. You don’t need a referral or other approval to get these vaccines. As described in the TRICARE Pharmacy Program Handbook, you can get these vaccines at no cost, as long as you:

Go to a military hospital or clinic.

Go to a TRICARE retail network pharmacy. Make sure the person who gives you the vaccine is a pharmacist. If another type of provider gives you a vaccine at a retail pharmacy, you may have out-of-pocket costs.

See a TRICARE-authorized civilian provider. However, if you get other services at the same time, you may have to pay copayments or cost-shares. These costs vary based on your health plan.

If you live overseas, you can get vaccinated at your local military hospital or clinic or by a TRICARE-authorized civilian provider.

Do you have more questions about the measles or getting an MMR or MMRV vaccine for yourself or your child? Talk to your healthcare provider or contact the MHS Nurse Advice Line.",https://dha.mil/-/media/Project/Images/News-Images/measles.png,N,0.0,2025-04-18 21:56:27.507781

Gibson said, “It’s an honor to serve our beneficiaries, and we strive to provide them with world-class health care service.”","Defense Health Agency military medical laboratory professionals play a crucial role in supporting warfighter readiness, said U.S. Navy Lt. Cmdr. Clara Pangco, laboratory department head at Naval Hospital Twentynine Palms in Twentynine Palms, California.

She is one of hundreds of military lab professionals who offer critical services and vital information to service members and families. “Lab teams are part of patients’ health care teams and assist providers in making clinical decisions,” said Pangco.

“We provide relevant information to help treat and diagnose,” she said. “From a warfighting readiness standpoint—we ensure service members are ready to deploy and can meet the demands of combat operations.”

It’s fulfilling and rewarding work, noted Pangco. “I love everything about laboratory science and its management, as we get to play scientists, investigators, and problem solvers every day,” she said, noting that their work is often behind the scenes.

“The laboratory result a patient or provider sees is but a small percentage of the work we do,” Pangco continued. “Day in and day out, we make sure the result is always accurate and reliable by ensuring we adhere to strict quality assurance requirements such as equipment maintenance, calibration, and quality control.”

Like the Twentynine Palms team, warfighter readiness is a priority for the lab team at Yokota Air Base in Tokyo, according to U.S. Air Force Lt. Col. Cordy Herring, Yokota Air Base lab officer. “All service members have Individual Medical Readiness requirements, which include specific immunizations, physical examinations, and medical evaluations,” he said. “The lab collects, tests, and ships samples for IMR testing to ensure people are medically ready for deployment. “We also run several programs contributing to readiness,” said Herring, “including a frozen blood program, an expeditionary blood program, a laboratory biological defense team, and a walking blood bank team.”

In addition, the Yokota Air Base lab team supports clinical operations. “The team examines tissues and bodily fluids and provides information to clinical teams to help determine overall health and treatment plans for our patients,” explained Herring. “We also provide blood products for hemorrhaging patients to save lives.”

The team collects forensic samples for alcohol-related incidents, aircraft mishaps, and also sends samples to assist with Department of Defense investigation processes. “We are always striving for continuous improvement,” Herring added.

These improvement efforts were showcased during a recent visit from the Air Force Blood Program and the Food and Drug Administration. “The visit resulted in the lab being named as one of the best within Japan’s DOD military hospitals and clinics,” said Herring. “The FDA was very impressed. We received a flawless inspection, acknowledging our safe blood practices and our commitment to care.”

Preventing Disease and the Spread of Infection

Lab professionals also help conserve service member strength by working to prevent disease and infection, said William Gibson, supervisory microbiologist at Madigan Army Medical Center at Joint Base Lewis-McChord, Washington. “Our lab tests over 100,000 specimens per year from beneficiaries on the West Coast, including Alaska, to the Midwest,” said Gibson. “The microbiology laboratory’s scope includes bacteriology, immunology, molecular microbiology, mycology, and blood parasitology. “We are currently working on several projects including cervical cancer screening through HPV testing,” he continued.

“We started HPV primary screening on April 7, 2025—this is a national guideline supported practice that is both workflow optimization and fiscally efficient,” said Gibson. “This summer, we intend to offer HPV self-collection testing, which has the potential to increase access to care.”

Communicable disease reporting is another ongoing project. “Infections are a fact of life. Everyone will be personally impacted by one throughout their lifespan,” he said. “Our active duty force travels the global and are exposed to a myriad of pathogens in which we must be able to provide education for prevention, prophylactics, diagnostics, and treatment for the world’s diseases. “We are looking to make sure that the reporting systems used to trace certain infections contain all the applicable test results across the DHA enterprise,” said Gibson. “This helps ensure the DHA, especially Epidemiology and Infection Control staff, have accurate data to react to things like outbreaks and facilitate an operational picture regarding medical intelligence.”

Delivering for Beneficiaries

Herring said the lab is needed. “Whether taking care of our patients, consoling a child when they are crying about getting blood collected, providing information to commanders to make decisions on careers, detecting possible biowarfare agents, or ensuring we can take care of our populace with blood programs—the lab is involved in operations,” he said.

This is all made possible through teamwork. “The team works hard together,” said Herring. “They excel in all duties and leave programs better than they found it. We take care of each other, support each other through the stressful times, and celebrate our wins. We’re proud of how much we have grown, how much we have accomplished.”

Pangco had praise for the staff at Twentynine Palms. “I am blessed with a great team,” Pangco said. ""Our recent successful FDA and College of American Pathologists reinspection was a testament of their hard work and dedication. The inspectors expressed noteworthy commendations. It was an all-around team success."" Ultimately, caring for beneficiaries is at the heart of the work of every lab professional.

Another exciting prospect is the expansion of telemedicine capabilities within military medical training. The DHA is working to improve remote consultation and training platforms, making it easier for medical personnel to access expert guidance and resources from anywhere in the world. This is particularly beneficial for those stationed in remote or austere locations, where traditional training resources may be limited.

Moreover, the DHA is committed to fostering collaboration between military and civilian healthcare systems. By enhancing interoperability, the agency aims to ensure seamless coordination during joint operations and large-scale emergencies. This collaboration is essential for optimizing resource allocation and improving overall healthcare outcomes.

As we move forward, the DHA’s strategic plans also include strengthening partnerships with academic institutions and research organizations. These collaborations will facilitate the exchange of knowledge and innovation, driving continuous improvement in military medical training methodologies. By leveraging the expertise of external partners, the DHA can stay at the forefront of medical education and ensure that military healthcare providers are equipped with the latest skills and techniques.

In conclusion, the future prospects for military medical training are bright, with the DHA leading the charge in implementing innovative strategies and technologies. As these advancements continue to unfold, they will play a pivotal role in preparing military medical personnel for the challenges of tomorrow, ensuring that they remain ready and capable of providing exceptional care in any situation.

Access to primary care and health insurance in Middle Tennessee varies widely by demographic.

There are approximately 4,147 primary care physicians currently in direct patient care across the state. However, access isn’t evenly distributed—the population per physician ranges from as low as 135 to over 14,000 across different counties.

To receive an emergency refill of prescription medications, TRICARE beneficiaries should take their prescription bottle to any TRICARE retail network pharmacy. If the bottle is unavailable or the label is damaged or missing, beneficiaries should contact Express Scripts, Inc., or their retail network pharmacy for assistance.

To find a network pharmacy, beneficiaries may call Express Scripts at 1-877-363-1303, or search the network pharmacy locator.

If possible, visit the pharmacy where the prescription was filled. Prescriptions filled by a retail chain may be filled at another store in that chain. If the clinician who prescribed the medication is available, beneficiaries can ask them to call in a new prescription to any network pharmacy.

As a reminder, TRICARE beneficiaries, other than active duty service members, may receive urgent care from any TRICARE-authorized urgent care center or provider and do not need a referral. This allows beneficiaries to seek nonemergency care for illnesses or injuries if their primary care provider is unavailable because of emergencies. Any TRICARE beneficiary who reasonably believes they have an emergency should always call 911 or, go to the nearest emergency room.

Beneficiaries are advised to visit Express Scripts’ Weather Notices page for updates.

If so, and your orders ended you are most likely on TAMP for 180 days, if that rings a bell, 180 days past the date your orders ended on, you can get back onto your reserve select or whatever you had.
If you were using other insurance and want to go back to TriCare, you *might* have to wait for open enrollment season, not entirely sure, I'd give them a call and figure it out with them, the tricare people are usually very helpful and easy to work with.
