Some plans cover the cost of in-network therapy sessions before the deductible is met; to verify whether your specific plan covers therapy sessions and at what rate, visit the Tricare website or call the number on the back of your insurance card and ask about your coverage for outpatient mental health.

The BHC Diego Garcia team, primarily staffed by U.S. Navy Medicine Readiness and Training Unit Sailors to meet outpatient medical and dental readiness requirements in this remote and crucial area of the region, immediately deployed to the point of injury to provide urgent medical assistance, stabilizing and transporting the patients to the clinic for further care.

As aeromedical evacuation coordination began, clinic personnel leveraged the Joint Tele-Critical Care Network (JTCCN), a Defense Health Agency (DHA) initiative that links deployed or remote medical teams with critical care specialists around the world. Through real-time telemedicine consultations, clinic staff received expert guidance to support complex clinical decision-making and enhance patient stabilization efforts.

“This is exactly what the JTCCN was built for,” said Capt. Torrin Velazquez, USNH Yokosuka director and commanding officer of U.S. Navy Medicine Readiness and Training Command. “By connecting our medical professionals in Diego Garcia to global expertise in minutes, we amplify readiness and ensure our Sailors and partners receive world-class care—no matter how remote the location.”

Cmdr. Joseph Labarbera, officer in charge of BHC Diego Garcia, commended his team’s dedication and coordination during the response.

“I am incredibly proud of the teamwork exhibited by the clinic staff,” Labarbera said. “It truly was an all-hands event where our small crew came together in a moment’s notice to provide lifesaving care. From our emergency vehicle operators and emergency medical technicians first on the scene, to our admin team coordinating reporting and medevac requirements, to clinical staff performing life-saving measures, to our ancillary department providing critical diagnostic support, our unit exceeded our capability to care for these individuals.”

The event highlighted how telemedicine capabilities serve as a force multiplier in remote operational environments. Without a full-time specialist on station, access to virtual consultations through the JTCCN enabled BHC Diego Garcia clinicians to make rapid, evidence-based decisions that improved patient outcomes.

“Technology like this transforms what’s possible in military medicine,” Velazquez added. “It ensures that even in the most isolated locations, our medical teams have the resources and reach of an entire network behind them. It is in line with the Secretary of the Navy’s priorities to foster an adaptive and warfighting culture while also improving the health and welfare of our Sailors, Marines, and civilian personnel.”

Through readiness, innovation, and collaboration, Navy Medicine and DHA continue to deliver trusted care and ensure the medical lethality and resilience of the joint force — anywhere in the world, at any time.",https://d1ldvf68ux039x.cloudfront.net/thumbs/photos/2511/9410587/1000w_q95.jpg,N,0.0,2025-11-26 00:56:24.759404

Coverage through the Federal Employees Dental and Vision Insurance Program may be a good choice for you. Here’s what you need to know about FEDVIP and how to sign up during Federal Benefits Open Season, which runs from Nov. 10 through Dec. 8 this year.

FEDVIP gives you coverage choices

FEDVIP is a voluntary insurance program for dental and vision care managed by BENEFEDS. If eligible, you can choose from 12 dental plan carriers and five vision plan carriers offering premium-based plans. This gives you options to find a plan that works for your needs and budget.

Who can sign up for FEDVIP?

Are you wondering if you’re eligible for FEDVIP? Your eligibility depends on your beneficiary category. Several groups can join. These include:

Federal employees

Retirees

Active duty family members – vision only

Survivors

Remember that FEDVIP coverage is separate from TRICARE health plans. It’s also separate from the TRICARE Dental Program and the Active Duty Dental Program. This makes FEDVIP useful for those who are eligible and want to purchase dental or vision care in addition to existing coverage through a TRICARE health plan, as described in the TRICARE Dental Program Handbook.

FEDVIP and TRICARE have different open seasons

Federal Benefits Open Season isn’t the same as the TRICARE Open Season. Federal Benefits Open Season is for dental and vision plans through FEDVIP. TRICARE Open Season is for TRICARE health plans. There are two separate enrollment periods since FEDVIP is separate from TRICARE. Make sure you know which one you need to act on.

How enrollment and payments work

BENEFEDS handles enrollment and payments for FEDVIP. When you have questions about signing up, changing plans, or paying your bill, contact BENEFEDS. Visit BENEFEDS to learn more and manage your account.

BENEFEDS doesn’t handle claims. If you have questions about your coverage or need help with a claim, call your dental or vision plan carrier directly.

Open season is happening now—act by Dec. 8

Now is your chance to enroll in, change, or cancel your FEDVIP dental or vision plan.

Changes you make during open season go into effect Jan. 1, 2026. Already enrolled in a FEDVIP plan? If you’re happy with your coverage, you don’t need to take any action. Your plan will continue as long as you’re still eligible.",https://www.militaryspot.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/251124-O-D0202-1001.jpg,N,0.0,2025-11-25 18:56:34.068410

For students, the course offered crucial insights, especially for those transitioning from other radiation safety fields.
""This course addresses my medical radiation safety program needs.” Other attendees found the course helped them refine their current practices.
The Defense Health Agency supports our Nation by improving health and building readiness—making extraordinary experiences ordinary and exceptional outcomes routine.","Defense Health Agency-Public Health has launched its first-ever Medical Radiation Safety Officer course to ensure a consistent standard of safety for patients and staff across its global network.

The course, which brings together service members and civilians for 40 hours of specialized training, was developed to address a critical gap in standardized training for radiation safety officers, or RSOs, who are responsible for overseeing the safe use of radioactive materials and X-ray-producing devices in military hospitals and clinics.

""A lot of times, a radiation safety officer is appointed by the commander or director as a collateral duty,” said Army Lt. Col. Jodi Santiago, chief of the health physics division at the Defense Centers for Public Health-Aberdeen. “This course provides the training so they can optimally execute their responsibilities.”

While civilian radiation safety courses exist, course developers emphasized that this program is uniquely tailored to the specific needs of DHA. ""We’ve really geared it towards what our military treatment facilities need,"" said Santiago. “The training addresses DHA policies and the military chain of command, aspects not covered in civilian programs.”

Brian Livingston, the DCPH-A Radiation Safety Officer and health physicist who spearheaded the curriculum's development, says the goal is to create a common set of skills and a professional network for RSOs spread across the world. ""Radiation-related incidents may occur at DHA facilities and we need trained (individuals/staff) to respond to these situations,” said Livingston. “We are working to learn from historic incidences to develop best practices to address issues and avoid future occurrences.""

For students, the course offered crucial insights, especially for those transitioning from other radiation safety fields. Navy Lt. Jeffrey Divis, a radiation health officer with an extensive background in industrial and naval nuclear programs, attended to bridge knowledge gaps for his new role in a medical center. ""I've been an RSO before, not on the medical side,"" said Divis. ""This course addresses my medical radiation safety program needs.” Other attendees found the course helped them refine their current practices.

""It's given me some things to go back and look at now that I've been doing the job for a year,"" said Jason Fewkes from Madigan Army Medical Center, located at Joint Base Lewis-McChord in Washington. “It really helps me refocus where I should be and take a look at how I can make things better.”

The comprehensive curriculum, which includes hands-on training with various radiation detection instruments, was highly praised by participants.

Army 1st Lt. Adrien Giuliano, a nuclear medical science officer at the Eisenhower Army Medical Center located at U.S. Army Fort Gordon, Georgia, was so impressed that he thinks the course should be mandatory for all new military health physicists. ""Everything we've gone over so far is really in-depth,"" said Giuliano. “I shared in one of my class evaluations that this course would benefit any new military health physicist.”

The course's instructors are a mix of experienced civilian certified health physicists and military nuclear medical science officers, who bring real-world experience from inspecting and managing military hospitals and clinics. They all have a simple, but vital, goal.

“My ultimate goal is that the course helps ensure the health and safety of patients and workers,"" said Jerry Falo, a DCPH-A health physicist. “I want to give the students some knowledge and information they can take back to their facilities and use in running their programs. I also hope to learn something from them so I can do an even better job supporting them here.”

The course organizers are gathering feedback to refine the program, with plans to offer it in the future and potentially take it on the road to other facilities, Santiago said.

Defense Health Agency-Public Health has launched its first-ever Medical Radiation Safety Officer course to ensure a consistent standard of safety for patients and staff across its global network.

The course, which brings together service members and civilians for 40 hours of specialized training, was developed to address a critical gap in standardized training for radiation safety officers, or RSOs, who are responsible for overseeing the safe use of radioactive materials and X-ray-producing devices in military hospitals and clinics.

""A lot of times, a radiation safety officer is appointed by the commander or director as a collateral duty,” said Army Lt. Col. Jodi Santiago, chief of the health physics division at the Defense Centers for Public Health-Aberdeen. “This course provides the training so they can optimally execute their responsibilities.”

While civilian radiation safety courses exist, course developers emphasized that this program is uniquely tailored to the specific needs of DHA.

""We’ve really geared it towards what our military treatment facilities need,"" said Santiago. “The training addresses DHA policies and the military chain of command, aspects not covered in civilian programs.”

Brian Livingston, the DCPH-A Radiation Safety Officer and health physicist who spearheaded the curriculum's development, says the goal is to create a common set of skills and a professional network for RSOs spread across the world.

""Radiation-related incidents may occur at DHA facilities and we need trained (individuals/staff) to respond to these situations,” said Livingston. “We are working to learn from historic incidences to develop best practices to address issues and avoid future occurrences.""

For students, the course offered crucial insights, especially for those transitioning from other radiation safety fields. Navy Lt. Jeffrey Divis, a radiation health officer with an extensive background in industrial and naval nuclear programs, attended to bridge knowledge gaps for his new role in a medical center.

""I've been an RSO before, not on the medical side,"" said Divis. ""This course addresses my medical radiation safety program needs.” Other attendees found the course helped them refine their current practices.

""It's given me some things to go back and look at now that I've been doing the job for a year,"" said Jason Fewkes from Madigan Army Medical Center, located at Joint Base Lewis-McChord in Washington. “It really helps me refocus where I should be and take a look at how I can make things better.”

The comprehensive curriculum, which includes hands-on training with various radiation detection instruments, was highly praised by participants.

Army 1st Lt. Adrien Giuliano, a nuclear medical science officer at the Eisenhower Army Medical Center located at U.S. Army Fort Gordon, Georgia, was so impressed that he thinks the course should be mandatory for all new military health physicists.

""Everything we've gone over so far is really in-depth,"" said Giuliano. “I shared in one of my class evaluations that this course would benefit any new military health physicist.”

The course's instructors are a mix of experienced civilian certified health physicists and military nuclear medical science officers, who bring real-world experience from inspecting and managing military hospitals and clinics. They all have a simple, but vital, goal.

“My ultimate goal is that the course helps ensure the health and safety of patients and workers,"" said Jerry Falo, a DCPH-A health physicist. “I want to give the students some knowledge and information they can take back to their facilities and use in running their programs. I also hope to learn something from them so I can do an even better job supporting them here.”

The course organizers are gathering feedback to refine the program, with plans to offer it in the future and potentially take it on the road to other facilities, Santiago said.

The Defense Health Agency supports our Nation by improving health and building readiness—making extraordinary experiences ordinary and exceptional outcomes routine.

This year’s theme, “The Kaleidoscope of Radiologic Technology,” emphasized the multifaceted role of all Defense Health Agency military treatment facility Radiology Department staff who support operational readiness, medical diagnosis, and military healthcare.

The Radiology Department staff provide critical clinical support services in support of force health protection and operational readiness. Compiled statistics from last year help to tell their multi-faceted importance.

There was a total of [approximately] 17,260 diagnostic exams performed in 2024, consisting of more than 750 computed tomography exams, nearly 1,300 mammography exams, over 340 magnetic resonance imagery exams, 465 ultrasounds and approximately 13,515 X-rays.

The annual Rad Tech Week gave the team thew opportunity to showcase radiology history, recognize staff achievements, and host training events designed to strengthen readiness and cross-departmental collaboration.

Hospital Corpsman 2nd Class Marlon Spruance Mercurio Fleming and Hospital Corpsman 3rd Class Juliana Raines, two of NMRTC Bremerton’s radiologic technologists dedicated to safeguarding readiness and delivering patient care reflected on their professional journeys and commitment to technical excellence and operational efficiency in their chosen field of expertise.

“Knowing the images I obtain directly impact diagnosis and treatment is what motivates me,” Fleming said. “We’re a key part of operational readiness, helping service members recover and return to the mission.”

Raines added, “Radiology is always evolving. Every day presents new challenges, whether it’s supporting surgical teams or urgent care. Our adaptability is vital for readiness.”

Each day begins with equipment and safety checks to ensure mission readiness. Fleming and Raines review schedules for special cases such as operating room support, portable exams, and trauma imaging for urgent care. Their routine combines technical skill, patient reassurance, and vigilant attention to radiation safety, supporting the wider operational health mission.

“The most rewarding moments come when you see the impact on patients and their families,” Raines said. “That’s when you know you’re contributing to readiness and recovery.”

Both attest that balancing efficiency and compassion is critical, especially in trauma scenarios where rapid imaging must be paired with patient-centered care.

“A common misconception is that we’re just button pushers,” Fleming explained. “In reality, we need deep anatomical knowledge, critical thinking, and a readiness mindset to support each department and patient.”

Core qualities for success include attention to detail, adaptability, and calmness under pressure.

“Clear communication and teamwork keep the hospital running smoothly, especially during staffing shortages or high operational tempo,” Fleming said. “Imaging supports almost every department, so our readiness directly affects the care we provide.”

Technologists at NMRTC Bremerton stay current by engaging in Navy online training modules, in-service sessions, and continuing education through Navy and national accredited organizations.

“Constant learning is non-negotiable,” Raines said. “Technology evolves rapidly, and staying updated ensures we’re always ready for any mission.”

In collaborating with nursing, surgery, urgent care, and outpatient clinics, Fleming, Raines and others coordinate closely, delivering the diagnostic support required for timely medical diagnosis and treatment.

When patients are anxious, in pain, or have special needs, technologists prioritize comfort and clear communication. Fleming and Raines take time to explain procedures, offer reassurance, and adapt imaging techniques to meet operational and patient care requirements.

For those considering a career as a Navy HM specializing in Rad Tech, Fleming advises, “Be ready to work hard and learn constantly. The technical and leadership skills you gain are unmatched. You’ll play an important role in maintaining operational readiness.”

Staffing shortages can stretch resources, especially during deployments and periods of high clinical demand. “We rely on teamwork and cross-training to meet operational goals,” Fleming said.

Raines added, “Flexibility and collaboration are key when the department is stretched thin.”

During National Rad Tech Week, NMRTC Bremerton’s radiology team honored the profession’s history and their ongoing commitment to operational readiness.

“Every image supports the mission,” Raines said. “It’s a privilege to serve and ensure our military community is prepared for whatever comes next.”",https://d1ldvf68ux039x.cloudfront.net/thumbs/photos/2511/9408026/1000w_q95.jpg,N,0.0,2025-11-24 18:56:19.145588

It doesn’t sound like this addresses that issue, but making Tricare cover young adults the same way any other insurance has to is a step in the right direction.

Is that going to be frustrating Jen Kiggans to see Letitia James SKATE on mortgage fraud over a technical WOOPS?

Imagine if REPUBLICANS found someone NOT Trump connected and CAN prove mortgage fraud 'STILL'?

I've only been trying for a year now to get the clueless West Virginia Republicans to LISTEN and hear & see my evidence ""the receipts"" that can PROVE it.",https://scontent-iad3-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t39.30808-6/589633094_1285401663626052_6143499504591985583_n.jpg?stp=dst-jpg_tt6&cstp=mx2048x1073&ctp=p600x600&_nc_cat=108&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=cae128&_nc_ohc=B_HtaYTZsr8Q7kNvwFTmqHA&_nc_oc=AdkkV7bCd8wY08zmHY73Eevt-BkJE9icZEJDCL5mjpmzcCUhYtAi0LwZOIsRRq_aKXp0P7pP5KnEar41lgF6w_XK&_nc_zt=23&_nc_ht=scontent-iad3-1.xx&_nc_gid=J6J6KxDHqRk6X5sX0BKxvA&oh=00_AfheTfrGKsgS9PNXhZVVeH2kkzWlt3XgkECL9cH95kQ1Ng&oe=692AC736,N,0.0,2025-11-24 20:56:35.054405

Once they do pick a day your main gate is open and not busy before your appointment and have your spouse get you a visitors pass (you'll have to be on-site with them for that, bring some ID) and that'll be active for a few days so you can get back on base.

Tricare is a common health insurance in Utah, and individuals who have Tricare may wish to find sex therapists who are in-network with their health insurance.

When you see a sex therapist who is in-network with Tricare, each session you’ll pay only a copay, which typically ranges from $0-$75/session. Depending on your plan, you may first need to pay the provider’s full session fee until you meet your annual deductible, which is the total amount of medical expenses required before your health insurance starts to cover costs. Some plans cover the cost of in-network therapy sessions before the deductible is met; to verify whether your specific plan covers therapy sessions and at what rate, visit the Tricare website or call the number on the back of your insurance card and ask about your coverage for outpatient mental health.

Best decision of my 38 year career. 10 months of full pay and benefits along with 2 years of annual leave payout leading into 12/31 retirement. Package very common in private sector but we have never seen that kind of offer in government and probably never will again. Best wishes and best of luck.

Navigating career advancement in federal jobs can be a complex and often frustrating process, but it also offers unique benefits like job security and meaningful work. Here's a succinct guide based on the experiences and advice shared by redditors:

Navigating the Hiring Process

Steps to Getting a Federal Job: The federal hiring process can be lengthy and intricate. Here are the nine steps as outlined by a redditor:

Apply.

Get referred to the hiring manager.

Get interviewed.

Get a Tentative Offer Letter.

Accept Tentative Offer.

Start a BI (background investigation).

Get Final Offer.

Get start date (EOD).

Walk through the door and take the Oath of Office. ""There are about nine steps to getting the job... The first major hurdle is to get referred to the hiring manager.""

Importance of Being ""Best Qualified"": To increase your chances, you need to be in the ""Best Qualified"" group, which is where hiring managers select candidates for interviews. ""You need to be in the Best Qualified group. That's the group that the hiring manager will choose from for interviews.""

Veterans and Other Preferences: Veterans, military spouses, and individuals with certain disabilities (Schedule A) receive hiring preferences. ""Veterans Preference: Say a disabled Veteran comes in at 90 due to how the HR specialist ranks the disabled Veteran’s resume and questionnaire, if there is one. The disabled Veteran gets a 10-point preference."" ""Schedule A is NOT a preference. It’s just a non-competitive hiring option.""

Resume Tips: Keep your resume concise and tailored to the job posting. ""As someone in HR Recruitment and Placement in the federal government, I can absolutely assure you that 2 pages of a resume is more than enough, and 8 pages is absurd."" ""I simplified my resume down to one page per my boyfriends advice and plugged it into the template. That’s when I started getting more referrals and have had two interviews since doing so.""

Challenges: The process can be slow and competitive. ""The interview process is horrifyingly slow and in my experience offers/interviews are communicated after i have already accepted another role."" ""We are getting 1500 applications for 1 position jobs that we would previously have gotten less than 150 for.""

Career Advancement Opportunities

Specific Roles: Consider roles like Legislative Aide, Foreign Service Officer, or Presidential Management Fellow (PMF). ""If you're younger or have less experience, becoming a Legislative aide or a foreign service officer are great for your career."" ""There are examples of people who use an MPA to career change, and for them something like the presidential management fellowship or consulting is great.""

Internships and Pathway Programs: These can be a good entry point into federal service. ""State/Federal Government: Internships/Pathway Programs""

Data Analysis and Consulting: If you have strong quantitative skills, data analysis jobs are an option. Consulting for federal clients can also be lucrative. ""If you go to a Quant heavy school and you like numbers you can easily land data analysis jobs.""

Pros and Cons of Federal Employment

Pros:

Job Security and Benefits: Federal jobs often come with good benefits and pensions. ""Public sector pays less upfront, but you trade burnout and instability for long-term security, union protection, and a pension.""

Meaningful Work: Many find federal jobs rewarding due to their impact. [""It's meaningful, impactful work that they (hopefully) really enjoy and wouldn't be able to do without the degree.""](https://www.reddit.com/r/PublicPolicy/comments/1d1anwn/comment/l",,N,0.0,2025-11-24 01:56:28.306084
