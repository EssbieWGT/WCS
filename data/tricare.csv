In an internal memo, Stephen Ferrara, the acting assistant secretary of defense for health affairs, ordered the U.S. Department of Defense (DOD) to implement the new rules immediately.

""I am directing you to take the necessary steps to immediately implement this guidance,"" Ferrara wrote in the short guidance obtained by journalists.

Reuters said it was directed by the Pentagon to send any questions pertaining to the order to the Defense Health Agency, but the outlet received no response.

Last week, Reuters reported on a memo showing that U.S. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth issued instructions that transgender troops were to either voluntarily leave or be removed from their posts starting on June 6.

This new memo appears to be a follow-up on Hegseth’s instructions.

According to official government statistics, there are 4,240 U.S. active-duty and National Guard soldiers with gender dysphoria, all of whom will be impacted by both orders.

As reported by HealthExec, in March the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) announced it would stop providing gender-affirming care to former military personnel, ending coverage for hormone therapy. The agency said it never covered surgical interventions, thus no new ban was imposed.

However, when issuing its guidance, the VA said the change would only impact new enrollees. Those already receiving care would continue to have it covered. It’s unclear if these new directives at the DOD will impact that policy.

(NASDAQ: ZYXI) is facing a double whammy linked to its dealings with TriCare, the healthcare program for the U.S. military community. The company's first-quarter 2025 results revealed a sharp downturn, largely attributed to a temporary payment suspension by one of its major payers, TriCare.

Adding to the company’s troubles, this very TriCare payment issue has now become central to a recently announced class action lawsuit filed on behalf of Zynex investors. The lawsuit, Tuncel v. Zynex, Inc., No. 25-cv-00913 (D. Colo.), alleges that Zynex and certain top executives violated federal securities laws between March 13, 2023, and March 11, 2025.

Disappointing Q1 2025 Results Due to TriCare Suspension

On April 29, 2025, Zynex reported that its net revenue for the first quarter of 2025 plummeted to $26.6 million, a significant drop from the $46.5 million reported in the same period of 2024. The company also experienced a contraction in gross profit margin, falling to 69% in Q1 2025, compared to 80% in the prior year. The bottom line reflected these challenges, with an adjusted EBITDA loss of $11.8 million, a stark contrast to the $1.7 million in adjusted EBITDA recorded in the first quarter of 2024.

On the earnings call, Zynex CEO Thomas Sandgaard directly cited the TriCare payment suspension as a primary driver of the disappointing first-quarter results. He stated that the disruption significantly impacted revenue calculations and prompted the company to initiate a restructuring to prepare for a scenario where TriCare payments remain halted.

Looking ahead, Zynex has offered a muted revenue guidance of $27 million for the second quarter of 2025, with an anticipated EPS loss of $0.20. The company has withheld full-year guidance pending clarity on the TriCare situation, a decision that reflects the significant uncertainty surrounding this key payer relationship.

Analysts on the earnings call voiced concerns that the TriCare situation could create a domino effect, prompting other insurers to re-evaluate their reimbursement policies for Zynex's device.

Zynex Securities Class Action Alleges ""Oversupplying"" Scheme

The payment woes with Tricare appear to be intertwined with more serious allegations leveled against Zynex in a newly filed securities class action.

The core of the lawsuit’s allegations mirrors the explanation provided by Zynex for its poor financial performance. Investors claim that the company misled them by failing to disclose practices that ultimately led to the TriCare payment suspension. Specifically, the lawsuit contends that Zynex shipped excessive amounts of products, including electrodes, inflating revenue and drawing scrutiny from insurers like TriCare. The plaintiffs argue that the company should have warned investors about the likely adverse consequences of these practices, including the potential for payment suspensions and removal from insurer networks.

The complaint highlights a more than 5% drop in Zynex's share price following a June 4, 2024 report by STAT detailing an alleged ""oversupplying scheme."" This report, according to the lawsuit, raised concerns about the company's billing practices and likely contributed to the increased scrutiny from payers like TriCare.

The lawsuit further points to a dramatic over 51% plunge in Zynex's share price on March 11, 2025, the day the company reported its disappointing fourth-quarter 2024 results and disclosed the significant TriCare payment suspension.

Hagens Berman’s Investigation

Shareholder rights firm Hagens Berman is investigating the alleged claims. “The significant revenue decline and the revised guidance following the TriCare payment suspension raise serious questions about the accuracy and timeliness of Zynex's prior statements to investors. We are investigating whether the company adequately disclosed the risks associated with its billing practices and its reliance on TriCare revenues,” said Reed Kathrein, the Hagens Berman Partner leading the firm’s probe.

Breen,,,,,https://natlawreview.com/article/eleventh-circuit-addresses-rule-9b-heightened-pleading-standard-false-claims-act,"The Eleventh Circuit reversed in part, holding that certain allegations of upcoding were adequately pleaded under Rule 9(b) to survive a motion to dismiss.
Reliability and Falsity The Eleventh Circuit concluded that the relators successfully pleaded specific allegations relating to the CPAP accessory scheme.
With this decision, the Eleventh Circuit has made clear that merely alleging fraudulent schemes or practices is not enough to survive a Rule 9(b) challenge.
Relators must allege concrete details connecting alleged schemes to actual false claims submitted to the government.
As demonstrated in Vargas, the Eleventh Circuit’s strict application of the standard underscores the high bar that relators must clear to avoid dismissal at the pleading stage.","The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit has concluded that a successful False Claims Act (FCA) claim should “allege not just a scheme, but a scheme that actually led to false claims being submitted to the government”—and must do so with particularity.

This heightened pleading standard cost the qui tam relators in United States ex rel. Vargas v. Lincare, Inc. et al., 24-11080, 2025 WL 1122196 (11th Cir. Apr. 16, 2025), three out of the four claims in their fourth amended complaint. The U.S. District Court for the Middle District of Florida had dismissed the entire complaint for failing to plead sufficient facts under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 9(b) (“Rule 9(b)”).

The Eleventh Circuit reversed in part, holding that certain allegations of upcoding were adequately pleaded under Rule 9(b) to survive a motion to dismiss. The complaint alleged that the defendants, a medical supplier and its subsidiary, improperly coded the accessories (i.e., batteries, chargers, and cables) of continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) machines as ventilator accessories. Ventilator accessories are covered by TRICARE, a health insurance program for military personnel and their families; CPAP accessories are not.

The Eleventh Circuit affirmed the dismissal of claims alleging: (1) the routine waiver of patient copays in violation of TRICARE conditions of participation; (2) automatic shipments of CPAP supplies, such as masks (TRICARE covers these supplies only upon a request); and (3) illegal kickbacks to employees of labs or medical offices who could choose which supplier was used.

“The most direct way to satisfy [Rule 9(b)] is by identifying specific claims submitted to the government: invoices, billing records, reimbursement forms,” wrote Senior U.S. Circuit Judge Gerald Bard Tjoflat. Alternative means (other than documentary proof) may satisfy Rule 9(b), the court noted, as long as the claim has “sufficient indicia of reliability”—a case-by-case determination.

Reliability and Falsity

The Eleventh Circuit concluded that the relators successfully pleaded specific allegations relating to the CPAP accessory scheme. The court rejected the defendants’ arguments that: (1) there were insufficient indicia of reliability to show that an actual claim was submitted, and (2) even if claims were submitted, they were not false. On these points, the court determined the following:

Reliability: The relators adequately alleged hands-on access to private records, including patient files, billing correspondence, and authorizations for payment—“the type of inside information that [is] sufficient at the pleading stage.” The relators identified specific claims (i.e., specific instances of upcoding), with dates, amounts, and billing codes.

Falsity: The relators adequately alleged that the coding practices were improper and the resulting claims were false. Though the defendants claimed that TRICARE allowed the substitute ventilator codes, this was a factual dispute and not grounds for dismissal, per the court.

Meanwhile, the relators identified no specific false claims submitted to TRICARE in connection with: (1) any co-pay waiver, (2) the auto-ship scheme involving CPAP replacement supplies, or (3) the alleged kickbacks.

No Shotgun Pleadings

In a separate concurrence, Judge Tjoflat called attention to a “foundational pleading defect that the District Court did not reach.” The relators’ fourth amended complaint, he noted, packed all four of the fraud claims described above into a single count—burdening the courts, defendants, and the appellate process.

“That is not how litigation works,” he wrote. “The fourth amended complaint is a shotgun pleading—something we have condemned time and time again. It…forces courts to play detective rather than umpire.”

Shotgun pleadings, the judge stated, run counter to Rule 8 (requiring statements in a claim to be “short and plain,” with allegations that are “simple, concise, and direct”) and Rule 10 (requiring each claim founding on a separate transaction or occurrence to be stated in a separate count, “if doing so would promote clarity”). When confronted with a shotgun complaint, he said, a defendant should move for a more definite statement under Rule 12(e). And a district court should sua sponte strike it—“early and firmly.”

Takeaways

The Vargas decision offers clarity in the Eleventh Circuit on the rigorous application of the Rule 9(b) “reliable indicia” standard in the FCA context. With this decision, the Eleventh Circuit has made clear that merely alleging fraudulent schemes or practices is not enough to survive a Rule 9(b) challenge. Relators must allege concrete details connecting alleged schemes to actual false claims submitted to the government. Failure to do so is likely to result in dismissal. As demonstrated in Vargas, the Eleventh Circuit’s strict application of the standard underscores the high bar that relators must clear to avoid dismissal at the pleading stage.

Panelists agreed that job satisfaction and sufficient support staff are paramount for retaining valuable medical personnel.

Medical Service Corps leaders, led by USU College of Allied Health Sciences Dean Dr. James Nash, explored strategies for preparing officers to thrive in an increasingly technology-driven environment. Their discussions centered on effective talent management, cultivating digital proficiency, ensuring interoperability between systems, harnessing the potential of artificial intelligence (AI), and bridging existing IT and informatics gaps. Attracting and retaining top talent through modern digital media engagement and prioritizing job satisfaction emerged as recurring themes.

USU Graduate School of Nursing (GSN) Dean Dr. Carol Romano moderated a panel of senior Nurse Corps leaders, who addressed similar challenges within their ranks, focusing on recruitment, retention, readiness, and targeted leadership development. Key strategies highlighted included improving outreach efforts, clearly defining leadership programs, expanding accessible online learning opportunities, and demonstrably valuing personnel through consistent engagement and mentorship. Army Brig. Gen. James Burk emphasized the necessity of transparent communication with staff, particularly during periods of transition.

Furthermore, a packed session, moderated by retired Navy Command Master Chief Tyrone Willis, USU recruitment officer, featured senior enlisted medical leaders illuminating the diverse educational and career pathways available within each service, offering valuable insights for enlisted personnel.

Innovating Care and Operations: From Global Engagement to AI

Innovation proved a central thread throughout the conference, touching upon global engagement, pioneering research, specialized care delivery, and system-wide operational improvements.

A session dedicated to Global Health Engagement (GHE) featured Army Col. (Dr.) Elizabeth Erickson, director of USU’s Center for Global Health Engagement (CGHE). Erickson discussed updated GHE terminology and outlined the strategic importance of both GHE and the National Guard Bureau’s State Partnership Program (SPP) in fostering collaboration with international allies. She stressed the need to align GHE activities directly with overarching strategic priorities. Col. Charla Geist described the SPP as a vital ""key tool for building enduring relationships."" Examples like the impactful Pacific Partnership mission and the Rush University Advanced Trauma Training Program served as powerful illustrations of effective GHE and successful military-civilian partnerships in action.

The conference also held discussions on women’s health research. Panelists, including Dr. Lynette Hamlin, professor and associate dean of USU's GSN, and Dr. Jill Brown, associate professor at USU, shared compelling research findings and unveiled a publicly accessible database designed to maximize the impact and reach of women's health research.

Retired Army Col. (Dr.) Craig Shriver, director of the Murtha Cancer Center, led a session exploring the definition and practical implementation of Centers of Excellence (CoEs), focusing on optimizing clinical care, driving process improvement, and advancing critical research. USU's Department of Preventive Medicine and Biostatistics, represented by its chair and professor, retired Army Col. (Dr.) James Mancuso, presented innovative educational products developed to directly support DoD force generation needs.

Another forward-looking session focused on the SAFEGUARD initiative, which utilizes machine learning and AI to predict behavioral health risks among service members. Panelists included experts such as Army Col. (Dr.) Vincent Capaldi and Dr. Joseph Geraci. Finally, in a session hosted and moderated by Dr. Drew Fallis, executive dean of the USU Postgraduate Dental College, Service Dental Corps chiefs discussed the integral role of dentistry in supporting overall DoD health and readiness.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) -The Pentagon is halting gender-affirming healthcare for transgender troops as it moves to implement President Donald Trump's plan to kick them out of the U.S. military, according to a memo seen by Reuters on Monday.

The instructions from the Defense Department barred any new hormone treatments as well as any surgical procedures for transgender troops, the memo said.

""I am directing you to take the necessary steps to immediately implement this guidance,"" Stephen Ferrara, the acting assistant secretary of defense for health affairs, said in the memo.

The Pentagon referred questions to the Defense Health Agency, which did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

Shannon Minter of the National Center for Lesbian Rights said that the abrupt termination of healthcare was ""needlessly disrespectful and cruel.""

""It is shameful that our nation's military would treat any service member this way,"" Minter said.

One transgender service member, speaking on condition of anonymity out of fear of being targeted, called the decision ""the latest slap in the face"" to troops serving honorably.

""If there was any doubt left, there is not anymore: transgender service members are no longer entitled to the same standard of medical care as their peers,"" the service member said.

The U.S. Supreme Court on May 6 permitted Trump's administration to implement his ban on transgender people in the military, allowing the armed forces to discharge the thousands of current transgender troops and reject new recruits while legal challenges play out.

Reuters first reported last week a memo showing that U.S. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth issued instructions to start kicking out transgender troops who do not elect to leave on their own by June 6.

There are 4,240 U.S. active-duty and National Guard transgender troops, officials have said. Transgender rights advocates have given higher estimates.

Trump signed an executive order in January, after returning to the presidency, that reversed a policy implemented under his predecessor Joe Biden that had allowed transgender troops to serve openly.

A Gallup poll published in February found that 58% of Americans favored allowing openly transgender individuals to serve in the military, but the support had declined from 71% in 2019.

A former Fox News host, Hegseth has embraced conservative stances on culture war issues, including eliminating diversity initiatives at the Pentagon. Hegseth had made clear his opposition to gender-affirming care for transgender troops in a post on social media last month.

Re-posting an article that said the Pentagon would resume treatments for transgender troops, Hegseth said: ""If this is true - we will find any way possible to stop it.""

""Taxpayers should NEVER pay for this lunacy,"" Hegseth added.

Sgt. Loura Javier, surgical technician, 673rd Medical Group, Joint Base Elmendorf-Richardson, Anchorage, Alaska, is leading a groundbreaking training partnership between JBER and Alaska Native Medical Center, a 182-bed, level 2 trauma hospital in Anchorage, Alaska.

Javier designed and launched a rotational training program that places one Defense Health Agency surgical technologist at a time into ANMC’s 11-suite operating room department for a month-long immersive experience.

Under Javier's stewardship, the program aims to expose technicians to a high volume of complex and trauma surgical procedures, equipping them with the skills necessary to tackle their demanding roles and prepare them for potential future conflicts.

“This program ensures our technicians are not only maintaining readiness but elevating it,” said Chief Master Sgt. Amy Miller, senior enlisted leader, 673 MDG. “Tech. Sgt. Javier has built a bridge between military and civilian care that directly enhances mission capability.”

Over the past six months, Javier has been embedded at ANMC, orchestrating the onboarding process, interfacing with human resources and employee health departments, and conducting orientations for the technologists who have completed rotations.

Senior Master Sgt. Michelle Mickens, operating room flight chief, 673 MDG, agrees.

“Tech. Sgt. Javier’s unwavering dedication ensures each training plan is tailored to the technician’s strengths and growth areas, optimizing their learning and performance,” Mickens said.

This initiative is vital to the development of Mission Ready Airmen, capable of protecting our nation, projecting joint forces, and powering the Joint Base in the Great Power Competition.

Under her leadership, five technologists have already rotated through the program, collectively participating in 245 surgical procedures. Each technologist participating in the program surpassed their annual Comprehensive Medical Readiness training requirements, showcasing the effectiveness of the partnership and Javier's leadership.

Javier’s forward-thinking approach is setting a new standard for training innovation within military medicine. Her efforts are not only advancing individual proficiency but also ensuring that JBER’s surgical technologists are better prepared for any operational challenge.

“Her leadership has created a model for future partnerships,” said Col. Laura Baugh, commander 673 MDG. “Tech. Sgt. Javier embodies the spirit of excellence, and her work will have a lasting impact on the future of military medical training.”",https://d1ldvf68ux039x.cloudfront.net/thumbs/photos/2505/9030512/1000w_q95.jpg,N,0.0,2025-05-12 15:56:50.623481

On June 4, 2024, medical journal STAT published a report on Zynex entitled ""How a device maker inundated pain patients with unwanted batteries and surprise bills."" The report claimed Zynex engaged in an ""oversupplying scheme"" by sending inordinate amounts of monthly supplies like electrode pads and batteries in order to ""bill insurers for thousands of dollars more than it otherwise could."" The report further revealed that, as a result of this practice, insurers were ""kicking the company out of network.""

On this news, Zynex's stock price fell $0.50 per share, or 5%, to close at $9.35 per share on June 4, 2024.

Then, on March 11, 2025, Zynex reported its fourth quarter and full year 2024 financial results, revealing a revenue ""shortfall"" in the quarter ""due to slower than normal payments from certain payers."" Zynex also revealed that Tricare, the healthcare program for uniformed service members that ""currently represents approximately 20-25% of [the Company's] annual revenue"", ""has temporarily suspended payments as they review prior claims.""

On this news, Zynex's stock price fell $3.59 per share, or 51.3%, to close at $3.41 per share on March 12, 2025.

SPRING HILL, Tenn., May 12, 2025 /PRNewswire/ -- Family Care Center, a leading provider of outpatient behavioral health services, proudly announces the opening of its newest clinic in Spring Hill, Tennessee. This expansion marks the organization's ninth location in the state and reinforces its commitment to addressing the urgent and growing demand for accessible, high-quality mental health care.

Mental health needs are growing nationwide, and in Tennessee, access remains a major concern, with the state ranking 43rd in the nation. Family Care Center's newest clinic is designed to help close that gap by offering timely, comprehensive treatment options for a wide range of mental health concerns.

""Opening this clinic in Spring Hill is a vital step in ensuring that individuals facing anxiety, depression, or other challenges can access the personalized, life-changing care they deserve,"" said Dr. Chris Ivany, CEO of Family Care Center. ""Our approach combines compassionate support with clinically proven treatments, helping individuals navigate their mental health journey with confidence.""

Family Care Center provides a variety of evidence-based treatments for patients of all ages, including individual and family therapy, psychiatric care, medication management, and transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS)—an FDA-approved, non-invasive treatment for depression, OCD, and other conditions that haven't responded to traditional therapies.

""Our goal is to create a safe, supportive space where individuals can access the tools and care they need to achieve lasting wellness,"" said David Wood, Regional Director for Family Care Center in Tennessee. ""Patients can see their therapist, psychologist, and other providers in one convenient location, with appointments available in days, not months.""

This patient-centered, integrated model isn't just more convenient—it works. Family Care Center consistently delivers outcomes that exceed national benchmarks.

85.5% of patients treated for depression report significant symptom reduction within six months

86.1% of patients treated for anxiety experience similar improvement

The Spring Hill clinic accepts most major insurance plans in Tennessee, including Aetna, Ascension, Blue Cross Blue Shield, Tricare, and others, making high-quality care more accessible and affordable for all.

To schedule an appointment or learn more about the Spring Hill clinic, visit www.fccwellbeing.com or call (888) 374-5066.

Family Care Center is a national leader in mental health services, dedicated to positively impacting the well-being of local communities. Their top-rated, multi-specialty clinicians deliver comprehensive, evidence-based care, providing positive outcomes for patients of all ages. In addition to therapy and psychiatric services, they are at the forefront of transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS), an innovative treatment for depression and more. Family Care Center is one of the fastest-growing mental health care providers in the U.S, providing patient care, conducting research and offering continuing medical education in their field. With over 40 locations across Arizona, Colorado, Florida, Tennessee and Texas, they continue to expand nationally in collaboration with Revelstoke Capital Partners.

Being a military family is rewarding in many ways, but it can also be challenging. The frequent moves and family separations can take a toll. When you have a family member with special needs, you may find you need additional support to thrive.

You’re not alone. Check out the information below to learn ways you can strengthen your family and get the support you deserve.

Understand Your TRICARE Benefits

TRICARE offers several services for beneficiaries with special needs under the basic TRICARE benefit, including applied behavior analysis, durable medical equipment, home health care, mental health care, and more. Some diagnoses may require health care services outside your current TRICARE coverage plan. In those situations, TRICARE offers Special Programs for certain health conditions, populations, or concerns.

Enroll in the Exceptional Family Member Program

If your spouse, child, or other dependent family member requires ongoing medical or educational services, enroll in the Exceptional Family Member Program (EFMP). Once enrolled, you will have access to a wide range of support and services. Here are some highlights:

Enrollment in EFMP ensures that your family members’ needs are considered during the assignment process.

The EFMP & Me Online tool provides checklists, resources, and referrals to guide you through the Department of Defense’s network of services and support. For example, you can create a checklist to guide you through your child care search or to help you navigate financial planning for your loved one. Each checklist can be expanded to display related tasks, tips, and other resources.

Your EFMP Family Support provider can share information, resources, and support to help you navigate systems of care by providing referrals and ways to bridge gaps and connect you with local resources.

Build a Support Network

Having a family member with special needs can be isolating and challenging at times. Having a strong support network to lean on, vent to, and allow you to catch your breath is important. Search online for a support group or community that can relate to what you’re going through. Ask your EFMP Family Support provider to connect you with other military families or others with a common need or concern.

Take Care of Yourself

When someone you love has special needs, it’s easy to let your own needs slip into the background. But if your tank is empty, it’s hard to give your all to those you love. Take care of yourself. Fuel yourself with nutritious foods, find time to move, and get enough rest.

Respite care provides you with a temporary break by putting your family member in someone else’s care. While this may seem difficult to consider, taking time away from your caregiving duties to attend an appointment or take some time for yourself can help you manage your health and wellness and be a stronger caregiver in the long run.

When you need a break, consider your respite care options. EFMP offers respite care if you meet eligibility requirements. In addition, TRICARE’s Extended Care Health Option offers up to 16 hours of in-home respite care to eligible families.

Reach Out to a School Liaison

If you have a school-aged child, reach out to a school liaison. School liaisons are experienced professionals located at each installation who can support, advise, and help you navigate common education challenges to ensure your child’s educational needs are met. For example, a school liaison can help you locate a school, advise you on enrollment requirements and processes, and connect you to special education resources.

Learn More About Additional Resources

You are your family member’s best advocate. It’s important to know as much as you can about the laws, services, and resources available to support you. Here are some additional resources you may find helpful:

ChildCare.gov provides a lot of information about specific diagnoses, early intervention services, special education services, social security benefits, and more.

Military OneSource special needs consultants are available to help you navigate services and connect you with both military and community-based support.

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention provides a Milestone Tracker app that helps you track your child’s development, learn the signs, and act early if you have a concern.

‘Where’s the penalty to them?’ | Military, Veteran mental health providers face financial breaking point after months without payment from TriWest

By Julieanna Jackson

May 7, 2025

“Since January 1, when TriWest Healthcare Alliance took over as TRICARE’s contractor for Texas and five other states, providers report going unpaid for services, some for as long as four months.”

“The payment issues appear to stem from technical failures in TriWest’s new system. Providers across the region have reported similar problems — spending hours on hold with customer service, receiving inconsistent answers, and having no clear timeline for resolution.”

“The reason that we exist and work in conjunction with TRICARE and the VA is because the VA cannot support the sheer numbers,” Serfass said. “We were at war in Iraq for 9 years, in Afghanistan for 19 years. The VA can’t handle them all if they don’t have support from the civilian mental health side.”

A longer video is part of the article above. Shorter video here:

Questions for elected officials:

Any report of TRICARE up and running smoothly in 2025?

Does the new TRICARE contract include penalties for not running smoothly on Jan 1st?

Do they all get paid the same whether customers are happy or not?

Pick a decade anytime after the war in Vietnam. No matter what political party or personality is in the White House, Uncle Sam struggles to get veterans health care to work properly. Moms, Dads, Grandparents, and young people have access to this info.

Issues include:

lack of payment,

delayed payments,

incorrect payment amounts,

lack of payment details,

paper check payments instead of electronic payments,

an inoperable provider portal (Availity), and

lack of response from TRICARE representatives.

AOTA has been in contact with the Defense Health Agency and has reached out to Congress to share concerns about these issues and to insist that they be fixed as soon as possible.

If you have been experiencing challenges with TRICARE since January 1, 2025, in addition to working with your TRICARE contacts there are two other actions you can take:

The Public News Service Friday afternoon update, I'm Mike Clifford.

President Donald Trump has signaled a willingness to drastically cut the U.S. current 145 percent tariff rate on China ahead of trade talks between the two countries.

That from NBC News.

The report Trump wrote in a social media post Friday morning, ""80 percent tariff on China seems right up to Scott B.""

And from the BBC, the new Pope, Leo XIV, has called for the Catholic Church to desperately counter a lack of faith in his first mass at the Vatican.

The Pope warned people were turning away from faith and instead to technology, money, success, power or pleasure.

Meantime, Republican lawmakers are considering billions of dollars to cuts to Medicaid.

A new report finds those spending cuts might impact health coverage for Virginia military families.

The report by the Georgetown Center for Children and Families finds more than 850,000 people enrolled in Medicaid have military health insurance, known as TRICARE, as their primary coverage.

One in 10 children of service members with TRICARE is also enrolled in Medicaid.

Retired Army Brigadier General George Schwartz says the youngest, lowest ranking and modestly paid service members would be most affected if Congress passes Medicaid cuts.

They're the most vulnerable and I think these cuts to Medicaid could affect not only their morale but their desire to stay in the military because they use Medicaid for supplementing particularly if they have children with special needs.

I'm Zimone Perez.

Next to Mississippi where new research shows folks may be experiencing the same climate change perception gap found across the globe when people underestimate how much their neighbors share their concerns.

The study published in Nature Climate Change found this pattern holds true in all 125 countries examined including the United States.

Anthony Leisowitz with the Yale Program on Climate Change Communication calls it a consistent human tendency.

The average person believes that other people in their own country tend not to worry about climate change that much when in fact the majority of people in most countries do worry about climate change.

He says the gap in perception has real world policy implications.

In the U.S. almost 80 percent of congressional staffers underestimated their constituents support for reducing climate pollution, sometimes by more than 50 percentage points.

I'm Tramiel Gomes.

According to NOAA data, the state has experienced a 42 percent increase in extreme rainfall since 2000.

And May is National Foster Care Month.

Carrie Eckert with Bethany Christian Services says their goal is to support families and kids through quality social services.

She shares a quote from the mother of Ellie, a girl from a tough background.

She has made honor roll every quarter, tried out for and made a sports team at her school, enjoys her youth group, volunteers with a club of her peers and in our church.

She handles her homework, manages her emotions, completes her chores, fills up her social calendar.

I'm just along for the ride, cheering her on.

In Pennsylvania, more than 15,000 children are waiting for foster families.

This is Public News Service.

A Michigan group is speaking out after a top congressional leader's comment that lawmakers will likely scrap the $7,500 federal tax credit for buying electric vehicles.

Ending the tax credit could deal a major blow to the EV market and the country's clean energy goals.

Michigan automakers and suppliers have pumped more than $30 billion into the state's EV industry since 2020.

Jay McCurry of Clean Fuels Michigan says her group joined several local and national nonprofits in signing a letter to the U.S.

House Transportation Committee in support of the EV tax credits.

Demonstrating that it's not just industry, not just individuals, but large nonprofits and advocacy groups that really care about continuing to show support for the clean mobility transition.

Despite growing Republican support for EV tax credits, some GOP senators have introduced the Elite Vehicles Act.

It would eliminate the $7,500 credit, a $4,000 credit for buying used EVs, and charging station incentives.

Crystal Blair reporting.

And despite uncertainty about Medicaid funding in Congress, Tennessee is moving ahead to help improve people's health outcomes with a program for community health workers.

The details from our Daniel Smith.

Tennessee's Medicaid program, TennCare, is partnering with the Tennessee Community Health Workers Association to offer an accreditation program that promotes best practices for training and supporting this workforce.

Nikala Boyd with the association says community health workers, or CHWs, link people to care and promote healthy habits.

So in addition to CHWs having individual certification, we are also accrediting the actual CHW program.

So accrediting that program, that organization, that employer.

TennCare will fund grants for up to 14 organizations to complete the accreditation process.

Finally, a new mapping tool shows South Dakota is a big player on the farm conservation scene.

The online feature coincides with polling that reveals most farmers want stronger funding for climate smart practices.

In a recent survey of more than 500 farms across the country, the National Wildlife Federation says three out of four support an increase in long-term funding for the USDA's voluntary conservation programs.

These initiatives incentivize farmers and ranchers to work their land in specific ways that make it more resilient to extreme weather, like prolonged droughts or widespread flooding.

The Federation's Aviva Glazer says survey support was consistent across geographic areas.

Farmers not only supported this funding, but they got a lot of value out of this funding and they cited things like soil health.

Meanwhile, NWSMAP shows South Dakota farmers have enrolled more than 7 million acres in the conservation stewardship program above all other states.
