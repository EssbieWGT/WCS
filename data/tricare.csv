Being a military family is rewarding in many ways, but it can also be challenging. The frequent moves and family separations can take a toll. When you have a family member with special needs, you may find you need additional support to thrive.

You’re not alone. Check out the information below to learn ways you can strengthen your family and get the support you deserve.

Understand Your TRICARE Benefits

TRICARE offers several services for beneficiaries with special needs under the basic TRICARE benefit, including applied behavior analysis, durable medical equipment, home health care, mental health care, and more. Some diagnoses may require health care services outside your current TRICARE coverage plan. In those situations, TRICARE offers Special Programs for certain health conditions, populations, or concerns.

Enroll in the Exceptional Family Member Program

If your spouse, child, or other dependent family member requires ongoing medical or educational services, enroll in the Exceptional Family Member Program (EFMP). Once enrolled, you will have access to a wide range of support and services. Here are some highlights:

Enrollment in EFMP ensures that your family members’ needs are considered during the assignment process.

The EFMP & Me Online tool provides checklists, resources, and referrals to guide you through the Department of Defense’s network of services and support. For example, you can create a checklist to guide you through your child care search or to help you navigate financial planning for your loved one. Each checklist can be expanded to display related tasks, tips, and other resources.

Your EFMP Family Support provider can share information, resources, and support to help you navigate systems of care by providing referrals and ways to bridge gaps and connect you with local resources.

Build a Support Network

Having a family member with special needs can be isolating and challenging at times. Having a strong support network to lean on, vent to, and allow you to catch your breath is important. Search online for a support group or community that can relate to what you’re going through. Ask your EFMP Family Support provider to connect you with other military families or others with a common need or concern.

Take Care of Yourself

When someone you love has special needs, it’s easy to let your own needs slip into the background. But if your tank is empty, it’s hard to give your all to those you love. Take care of yourself. Fuel yourself with nutritious foods, find time to move, and get enough rest.

Respite care provides you with a temporary break by putting your family member in someone else’s care. While this may seem difficult to consider, taking time away from your caregiving duties to attend an appointment or take some time for yourself can help you manage your health and wellness and be a stronger caregiver in the long run.

When you need a break, consider your respite care options. EFMP offers respite care if you meet eligibility requirements. In addition, TRICARE’s Extended Care Health Option offers up to 16 hours of in-home respite care to eligible families.

Reach Out to a School Liaison

If you have a school-aged child, reach out to a school liaison. School liaisons are experienced professionals located at each installation who can support, advise, and help you navigate common education challenges to ensure your child’s educational needs are met. For example, a school liaison can help you locate a school, advise you on enrollment requirements and processes, and connect you to special education resources.

Learn More About Additional Resources

You are your family member’s best advocate. It’s important to know as much as you can about the laws, services, and resources available to support you. Here are some additional resources you may find helpful:

ChildCare.gov provides a lot of information about specific diagnoses, early intervention services, special education services, social security benefits, and more.

Military OneSource special needs consultants are available to help you navigate services and connect you with both military and community-based support.

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention provides a Milestone Tracker app that helps you track your child’s development, learn the signs, and act early if you have a concern.

‘Where’s the penalty to them?’ | Military, Veteran mental health providers face financial breaking point after months without payment from TriWest

By Julieanna Jackson

May 7, 2025

“Since January 1, when TriWest Healthcare Alliance took over as TRICARE’s contractor for Texas and five other states, providers report going unpaid for services, some for as long as four months.”

“The payment issues appear to stem from technical failures in TriWest’s new system. Providers across the region have reported similar problems — spending hours on hold with customer service, receiving inconsistent answers, and having no clear timeline for resolution.”

“The reason that we exist and work in conjunction with TRICARE and the VA is because the VA cannot support the sheer numbers,” Serfass said. “We were at war in Iraq for 9 years, in Afghanistan for 19 years. The VA can’t handle them all if they don’t have support from the civilian mental health side.”

A longer video is part of the article above. Shorter video here:

Questions for elected officials:

Any report of TRICARE up and running smoothly in 2025?

Does the new TRICARE contract include penalties for not running smoothly on Jan 1st?

Do they all get paid the same whether customers are happy or not?

Pick a decade anytime after the war in Vietnam. No matter what political party or personality is in the White House, Uncle Sam struggles to get veterans health care to work properly. Moms, Dads, Grandparents, and young people have access to this info.

Transcript

The Public News Service Friday afternoon update, I'm Mike Clifford.

President Donald Trump has signaled a willingness to drastically cut the U.S. current 145 percent tariff rate on China ahead of trade talks between the two countries.

That from NBC News.

The report Trump wrote in a social media post Friday morning, ""80 percent tariff on China seems right up to Scott B.""

And from the BBC, the new Pope, Leo XIV, has called for the Catholic Church to desperately counter a lack of faith in his first mass at the Vatican.

The Pope warned people were turning away from faith and instead to technology, money, success, power or pleasure.

Meantime, Republican lawmakers are considering billions of dollars to cuts to Medicaid.

A new report finds those spending cuts might impact health coverage for Virginia military families.

The report by the Georgetown Center for Children and Families finds more than 850,000 people enrolled in Medicaid have military health insurance, known as TRICARE, as their primary coverage.

One in 10 children of service members with TRICARE is also enrolled in Medicaid.

Retired Army Brigadier General George Schwartz says the youngest, lowest ranking and modestly paid service members would be most affected if Congress passes Medicaid cuts.

They're the most vulnerable and I think these cuts to Medicaid could affect not only their morale but their desire to stay in the military because they use Medicaid for supplementing particularly if they have children with special needs.

I'm Zimone Perez.

Next to Mississippi where new research shows folks may be experiencing the same climate change perception gap found across the globe when people underestimate how much their neighbors share their concerns.

The study published in Nature Climate Change found this pattern holds true in all 125 countries examined including the United States.

Anthony Leisowitz with the Yale Program on Climate Change Communication calls it a consistent human tendency.

The average person believes that other people in their own country tend not to worry about climate change that much when in fact the majority of people in most countries do worry about climate change.

He says the gap in perception has real world policy implications.

In the U.S. almost 80 percent of congressional staffers underestimated their constituents support for reducing climate pollution, sometimes by more than 50 percentage points.

I'm Tramiel Gomes.

According to NOAA data, the state has experienced a 42 percent increase in extreme rainfall since 2000.

And May is National Foster Care Month.

Carrie Eckert with Bethany Christian Services says their goal is to support families and kids through quality social services.

She shares a quote from the mother of Ellie, a girl from a tough background.

She has made honor roll every quarter, tried out for and made a sports team at her school, enjoys her youth group, volunteers with a club of her peers and in our church.

She handles her homework, manages her emotions, completes her chores, fills up her social calendar.

I'm just along for the ride, cheering her on.

In Pennsylvania, more than 15,000 children are waiting for foster families.

This is Public News Service.

A Michigan group is speaking out after a top congressional leader's comment that lawmakers will likely scrap the $7,500 federal tax credit for buying electric vehicles.

Ending the tax credit could deal a major blow to the EV market and the country's clean energy goals.

Michigan automakers and suppliers have pumped more than $30 billion into the state's EV industry since 2020.

Jay McCurry of Clean Fuels Michigan says her group joined several local and national nonprofits in signing a letter to the U.S.

House Transportation Committee in support of the EV tax credits.

Demonstrating that it's not just industry, not just individuals, but large nonprofits and advocacy groups that really care about continuing to show support for the clean mobility transition.

Despite growing Republican support for EV tax credits, some GOP senators have introduced the Elite Vehicles Act.

It would eliminate the $7,500 credit, a $4,000 credit for buying used EVs, and charging station incentives.

Crystal Blair reporting.

And despite uncertainty about Medicaid funding in Congress, Tennessee is moving ahead to help improve people's health outcomes with a program for community health workers.

The details from our Daniel Smith.

Tennessee's Medicaid program, TennCare, is partnering with the Tennessee Community Health Workers Association to offer an accreditation program that promotes best practices for training and supporting this workforce.

Nikala Boyd with the association says community health workers, or CHWs, link people to care and promote healthy habits.

So in addition to CHWs having individual certification, we are also accrediting the actual CHW program.

So accrediting that program, that organization, that employer.

TennCare will fund grants for up to 14 organizations to complete the accreditation process.

Finally, a new mapping tool shows South Dakota is a big player on the farm conservation scene.

The online feature coincides with polling that reveals most farmers want stronger funding for climate smart practices.

In a recent survey of more than 500 farms across the country, the National Wildlife Federation says three out of four support an increase in long-term funding for the USDA's voluntary conservation programs.

These initiatives incentivize farmers and ranchers to work their land in specific ways that make it more resilient to extreme weather, like prolonged droughts or widespread flooding.

The Federation's Aviva Glazer says survey support was consistent across geographic areas.

Farmers not only supported this funding, but they got a lot of value out of this funding and they cited things like soil health.

Meanwhile, NWSMAP shows South Dakota farmers have enrolled more than 7 million acres in the conservation stewardship program above all other states.

Rodriguez, a former licensed pharmacist, owned and operated Pharr Family Pharmacy.
