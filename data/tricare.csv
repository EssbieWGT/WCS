Over a 15-month period, the medical center performed 78 robotic navigational bronchoscopy procedures, achieving a diagnostic accuracy rate of 91 percent. This performance places Madigan among the top facilities nationwide using similar technology and exceeds the averages reported in recent studies.

A majority of the positive diagnoses made at Madigan during this period were cases of lung cancer. In total, 56 cancer cases were identified, along with several cases involving infection, inflammation, or other non-cancerous conditions. The program’s findings also helped guide decisions about surgical treatment. More than 50 patients were referred for surgery based on the results of their robotic bronchoscopy, and in 44 of those cases, the cancer diagnosis was confirmed after the tissue was removed. This high confirmation rate reflects the accuracy of the robotic system in identifying malignant nodules and ensuring patients receive the right care at the right time.

Several features contribute to the program’s outcomes. The Ion system’s shape-sensing technology enables physicians to precisely navigate to the target area, while rapid on-site evaluation allows pathologists to examine biopsy samples immediately during the procedure. Together, these capabilities help clinicians quickly determine whether enough tissue has been collected, reducing the need for repeat procedures.

With its strong performance, low complication rate, and ability to diagnose and guide treatment in a single visit, Madigan’s Ion program represents a major step forward in lung cancer care within the Military Health System. The early results show that robotic-assisted bronchoscopy can improve the accuracy of lung cancer detection while easing the overall process for patients, offering a promising model for future expansion across military and civilian hospitals alike.

Through Walter’s Way, a new “one-call solution” initiative, patients can reach their care team directly, get advice from a nurse, schedule appointments, and even request prescription renewals, all in one call.

“The idea behind Walter’s Way is putting our patients and their needs first with a one-call solution to take care of their needs,” said U.S. Army Lt. Col. Elizabeth Simmons, Deputy Director for the Department of Medicine and Primary Care lead for Walter’s Way. “Whether it’s nursing advice, same-day appointments, or medication renewals, we want to go above and beyond for our Walter Reed family.”

Callers reach a staffed line that pairs nurses and medical support assistants (MSAs). The team can schedule well visits, same-day or next-day acute care, check referral status, and begin prescription-renewal processes. Walter’s Way also now includes nurse triage on the initial call, so patients receive clinical guidance immediately.

“Our triage nurses can help determine if any issue can be managed at home, needs medical advice, or requires an in-person or virtual visit,” said Simmons. “It’s all about providing the right care at the right time.”

The Primary Care department, which includes pediatrics, adolescent and young adult medicine (AYA), and internal medicine, now offers expanded hours. Early morning, evenings and Saturday clinics will help patients fit their care into busy schedules. Internal medicine provides virtual Saturday appointments and pediatrics offer early appointments for school-day families and full Saturday clinics.

“We’ve designed our schedule to meet patients where they are. That flexibility is a big part of Walter’s Way,” said Simmons.

The initiative also helps strengthen continuity of care by connecting patients to their primary care team more consistently. The program standardizes triage protocols and ensures that patients are scheduled appropriately for in-person or virtual visits, improving both access and clinical outcomes.

Patients have already noticed the difference. One family praised a Walter’s Way nurse who “went above and beyond to help us get my son scheduled for an appointment.”

The phrase National Guard Substance Abuse Program is often used as a catch-all for the prevention, education, screening, referral, and treatment pathways available to National Guard members who are dealing with alcohol or drug-related concerns.

In real life, it is not always one single, uniform program that looks the same in every unit and every state. It commonly reflects how Guard resources, duty status rules, and clinical care options work together for a particular member at a particular time.

If you are searching for a substance abuse program for National Guard members, the practical answer is that support is usually available. However, the “right” pathway depends on who you are (service member or family), your duty status, and what level of care you need.

Our latest resource from TriCareRehabs.com is here to help you fully understand the landscape involved in what is covered for both National Guard members and their families when it comes to addiction and mental health treatment.

What is the National Guard Substance Abuse Program?

At its core, the National Guard Substance Abuse Program is a structured approach to reduce risk, identify concerns early, and connect active duty service members to appropriate support.

For some people, that support starts with education, drug abuse prevention, suicide prevention, or a brief intervention. For others, it includes clinical evaluation and engagement in national guard substance abuse treatment that matches the severity of the issue and the realities of military life.

An important detail for many Guardsmen is that treatment may occur in civilian settings. National Guard members live and work in their communities, so care is often delivered by licensed civilian providers even when the Guard is involved in referral, coordination, or readiness considerations.

Who Is Eligible for National Guard Substance Abuse Program Support?

Eligibility is often broad, but the route into services can vary based on the service component and individual circumstances. In general, any National Guard member who has concerns about alcohol or drug use, impairment, or related consequences may be able to access screening, referral guidance, or treatment coordination through Guard channels.

Eligibility and Duty Status: Title 10, Title 32, and Drilling Status

Duty status matters because it can determine which policies apply and which systems you are operating within. This is one reason online answers can sound inconsistent.

Two people can ask the same question and get two different correct answers if their duty statuses are different.

Family Members and Dependents

Families often want to know whether they can access help through the same “program.” Guard-facing programs tend to focus on the service member, but family members may have access to separate support resources.

In some situations, family involvement may also be clinically appropriate within the service member’s treatment plan.

Confidentiality and Command Involvement

Many Guardsmen hesitate because they worry that asking for help automatically becomes a disciplinary matter. How confidentiality works depends on the type of service being used (non-medical counseling versus medical treatment), safety requirements, and the policies that apply in your current context.

A useful way to think about it is that different doors have different rules, and part of getting oriented is knowing which door you are walking through.

Are National Guardsmen Covered By ASAP?

The question: Are Guardsmen Covered By ASAP? Comes up frequently because ASAP is a well-known Army framework. The evergreen answer is: it depends on status and context.

Some Guard members may fall under ASAP rules in certain circumstances, while others will follow Guard-specific pathways, state-directed procedures, or civilian clinical systems.

When ASAP May Be the Right Framework

ASAP may be relevant when a Guardsman is operating in an Army active-duty environment or when Army policy is the controlling structure for prevention, drug testing, referral, or rehabilitation processes.

When Guard-Specific Pathways Are More Common

For many drilling members, the pathway may look more like Guard coordination plus civilian clinical care. TriCareRehabs typically frames this point neutrally: the name of the program matters less than identifying which pathway applies to your duty status and location, because that determines what happens next.

What National Guard Substance Abuse Treatment Can Look Like

There is no single template for National Guard substance abuse treatment or for substance-impaired soldiers, but most well-designed pathways include three building blocks: assessment, a level-of-care match, and coordination around real-world obligations.

Screening and Assessment

Treatment commonly begins with an evaluation of drug abuse(frequency, loss of control, risk behaviors), mental health symptoms (such as anxiety, depression, trauma symptoms, or sleep problems), medical considerations, and safety risks.

The goal is to determine what level of care is appropriate and whether additional support at a treatment facility is needed for co-occurring concerns.

Levels of Care and Medical Coverage Basics

When treatment is medically necessary, coverage rules and available services can include inpatient treatment, intensive outpatient services, partial hospitalization, medication-assisted treatment, and withdrawal management (detoxification support).

The appropriate level of care is based on clinical need, not just convenience, and there may be specific rules or limits depending on plan and setting.

Coordinating Care With Drills, Training, and Possible Activation

Guard members have unique scheduling constraints, including drill weekends, annual training, and potential mobilization. Treatment planning sometimes includes practical coordination so care can remain consistent and clinically appropriate even when obligations shift.

Using Support Resources That Are Not Formal Addiction Treatment

Many service members and families benefit from confidential, short-term counseling supports for stress, relationships, reintegration challenges, grief, or parenting pressures that may surround or worsen substance use or other drug abuse.

It is important to understand what these services are and are not.

Non-medical counseling can be helpful for life stressors and navigation, but it is not the same as clinical substance use disorder treatment and is not designed to replace it, nor does it serve as a drug abuse deterrence when a person is actively struggling.

Get Substance Abuse Support in the Guard Today

A National Guard Substance Abuse Program is best understood as coordinated pathways that help National Guard members access education, screening, referral support, and National Guard substance abuse treatment when needed.

The question: Are Guardsmen Covered By ASAP? Does not have one universal answer, because duty status and service context can determine which policy framework applies.

What remains consistent is that there are usually multiple avenues for support, and the most clinically sound approach is to match the level of care to the seriousness of need while accounting for the realities of Guard service.

We know this can sound daunting, which is why TriCareRehabs.com offers confidential placement support for guardsmen at some of the top facilities nationwide that offer accredited support programs to support sustainable recovery.

All calls are confidential, so please reach out for trusted TRICARE treatment options now.
