Yes. I use the VA for everything. I get great quality of care in my continuity of cares several decades now.

This service is particularly beneficial for those unable to visit a provider’s office in person.

Accessing Virtual Mental Health Care with TRICARE

TRICARE offers a comprehensive range of mental health services, including:

Outpatient services

Inpatient services

Emergency care

Nonemergency care

Substance use disorder services

Virtual visits utilize secure technology, allowing users to receive necessary care flexibly. Thomas Turnbaugh, a behavioral health specialist at the Defense Health Agency, highlights the convenience of these services, saying, “You have several different options for seeking this care, regardless of which TRICARE plan you have or where you live.”

Eligibility and Requirements for Virtual Care

For virtual mental health care within the U.S., patients should first connect with their regional contractor to identify an appropriate provider. Those receiving care at military hospitals may also access some virtual mental health services directly at their facility.

Notably, active-duty service members require a referral and pre-authorization from their primary care managers to utilize these virtual services.

Overseas Access to Virtual Mental Health Services

For individuals living outside the U.S., virtual mental health services are accessible as long as certain criteria are met:

The service must be a TRICARE-covered benefit suitable for virtual care.

The host country must permit virtual health services.

The provider must be TRICARE-authorized and licensed in that country.

The provider must understand local protocols for emergencies.

Those using TRICARE Overseas Program should contact their regional call center for specific provider information and potential referral requirements.

TRICARE For Life and Medicare Changes

TRICARE For Life beneficiaries should be aware of recent updates concerning Medicare’s virtual health coverage. Starting October 1, 2025, most virtual health services will necessitate in-person visits at rural facilities in the U.S. However, virtual mental health services, including those for substance use disorders, can still be accessed from home.

Before scheduling any appointments, beneficiaries should verify coverage details through TRICARE and Medicare to ensure they are informed about their options. TRICARE will cover costs first if Medicare does not.

Requirements for Using Virtual Mental Health Services

To effectively use TRICARE’s virtual mental health services, individuals need the following:

A computer or smartphone for video consultations

A telephone for audio-only consultations

A secure internet connection

Referrals or pre-authorizations, if applicable

The costs associated with virtual visits are generally comparable to those of in-person appointments. Patients will need to account for typical co-pays and cost shares.

TRICARE remains dedicated to enhancing access to mental health care for service members and their families, ensuring support is readily available when needed.

By Gizem Nisa Demir

ISTANBUL (AA) - Eighty-one women have now joined a civil lawsuit in Texas accusing a US Army gynecologist at Fort Hood of sexual misconduct during medical exams, as the army faces growing scrutiny over patient safety and internal oversight.

Newsmax reported Friday that the expanded complaint, filed in Bell County, alleges Maj. Blaine McGraw covertly recorded patients, engaged in inappropriate touching, and conducted intrusive, unnecessary exams while serving at the Carl R. Darnall Army Medical Center.

The civil case runs alongside an ongoing criminal prosecution, in which army prosecutors have charged McGraw with more than 50 specifications of “indecent visual recording” involving dozens of alleged victims, according to army officials.

- Monitoring case 'very closely'

Army leadership has acknowledged the gravity of the allegations. Undersecretary of the Army Mike Obadal and Army Surgeon General Lt. Gen. Mary Izaguirre recently visited the Fort Hood facility to review Defense Health Agency policies.

“Our ethical and moral imperative is to ensure deployment-ready forces while providing a safe and professional environment for all patients,” Obadal said.

“I’m proud of our leaders and medical providers for the swift action taken to initiate the criminal investigation and prioritize patient safety — all of which reflects their unwavering commitment to patient care and army readiness.”

A US official, speaking anonymously, said Army Secretary Daniel Driscoll has been monitoring the case “very, very closely” and ordered a fact-finding mission to assess conditions “on the ground.”

“It goes without saying that the allegations are abhorrent, absolutely counter to the values the army and the military try to uphold,” the official added.

McGraw, 47, has been held in pretrial confinement at the Bell County Jail since early December. Army officials say he was removed from patient care in October, within hours of the first complaint. Defense attorneys have not publicly responded to the expanded lawsuit.

A civil lawsuit against Army Maj. Blaine McGraw expanded this week when the women added claims accusing the gynecologist of inappropriate touching, covert filming, and other alleged misconduct during medical exams.

The development is the latest in a case already under criminal prosecution and now prompting official Army leadership statements.

McGraw, a medical officer at Carl R. Darnall Army Medical Center at Fort Hood, was charged by the Army’s Office of Special Trial Counsel with more than 50 specifications of ""indecent visual recording"" and related offenses involving dozens of victims, according to Army officials.

The expanded civil complaint, filed in Bell County, Texas, alleges McGraw violated state assault, sexual assault, and battery laws and harmed patients through intrusive and unnecessary exams.

Plaintiffs say McGraw took advantage of his position of trust to record intimate procedures secretly.

In published statements, Army leaders acknowledged the seriousness of the allegations and outlined steps being taken to review policies and protect patients.

Undersecretary of the Army Mike Obadal and Army Surgeon General Lt. Gen. Mary Izaguirre visited the medical center to review Defense Health Agency policies.

""Our ethical and moral imperative is to ensure deployment-ready forces while providing a safe and professional environment for all patients,"" Obadal said.

""I’m proud of our leaders and medical providers for the swift action taken to initiate the criminal investigation and prioritize patient safety — all of which reflects their unwavering commitment to patient care and Army readiness.""

A U.S. official, speaking on condition of anonymity about internal Army leadership discussions, said Army Secretary Daniel Driscoll has been monitoring the situation ""very, very closely"" and dispatched the team at Fort Hood as a fact-finding mission to understand the situation ""on the ground.""

""It goes without saying that the allegations are abhorrent, absolutely counter to the values the Army and the military try to uphold,"" the official said.

The civil complaint also contends that McGraw ""failed to document in her medical records that a rape kit had ever been performed,"" which the plaintiff’s lawyers argued interfered with subsequent criminal prosecution of an alleged assailant.

McGraw, 47, has been held in pretrial confinement in Bell County Jail since early December.

Army officials say he was suspended from patient care in October after the first allegations surfaced and that investigators began reviewing his conduct within hours of the initial complaint.

Attorneys for the women filed the expanded civil complaint shortly after the government announced criminal charges.

Describing Rubertone as an “icon in the Military Health System,” DHA Public Health Deputy Director Sean Friendly said, “His development of the Defense Military Surveillance System has tracked every military member medical encounter since 1997.
“Over 30 years ago, Dr. Rubertone created several important tools for military force health protection and readiness that are widely used today,” said Navy Capt.
“His unique skill set allows him to act as the bridge over the gap between information technology and public health epidemiology,” she said.
“I'm driven by a deep sense of service and a desire to use my skills to make a positive impact.”","Dr. Mark Rubertone, chief of functional information technology support for Defense Health Agency’s Armed Forces Health Surveillance Division within DHA-Public Health, received the Department of War’s Distinguished Civilian Service Award during a ceremony Dec. 3, 2025, at the Pentagon in Arlington, Virginia.

“I'm deeply grateful and humbled by this recognition,” said Rubertone. “Receiving this award is a testament to the dedication and hard work of the entire team I've had the privilege to lead and work alongside. It means a great deal to me — not just as an individual achievement — but as validation of the importance of public health data and health IT in supporting our nation's warfighters.”

The award is DOW’s highest recognition for career civilian employees whose work improves the efficiency and impact of the entire department.

Describing Rubertone as an “icon in the Military Health System,” DHA Public Health Deputy Director Sean Friendly said, “His development of the Defense Military Surveillance System has tracked every military member medical encounter since 1997. This system is critical to execute comprehensive health surveillance on our military family.”

Rubertone said the award is “truly a reflection of the incredible team I've been fortunate to work with throughout my career and in particular during the past 10 years at DHA. The success we've achieved is entirely attributable to their expertise, dedication, and unwavering commitment to our mission.”

Modernizing health data for readiness

As functional IT support chief, Rubertone led teams to upgrade tools used for tracking the burden of disease, injury, and illness among beneficiaries across the Military Health System.

Those systems helped public health experts study trends ranging from musculoskeletal injuries to COVID-19 and measure the effectiveness of prevention and treatment efforts. The data collected was vital for leaders in Congress, the Department, and the Department of Health and Human Services to set policy and allocate services.

“Over 30 years ago, Dr. Rubertone created several important tools for military force health protection and readiness that are widely used today,” said Navy Capt. Carlos Williams, deputy chief of AFHSD. “The impact of these tools on warfighter readiness comes from how they are used to track, interpret, validate, and communicate essential health threats that directly affect the force.”

Rubertone underscored his commitment to warfighter lethality, stating, “My work, at its core, is about ensuring our warfighters are healthy, protected, and ready to answer the call of duty. We accomplish this by providing data and tools necessary to identify threats to their health, track injury and illness trends, and measure the effectiveness of preventive measures.”

Air Force Col. Cecilia Session, chief of AFHSD’s epidemiology and analysis branch, highlighted Rubertone’s ability at translating complex data into clear, reliable information for commanders and policymakers. “His unique skill set allows him to act as the bridge over the gap between information technology and public health epidemiology,” she said. “As the DHA’s systems evolve to incorporate advances in information technology, he is the vanguard of modernizing and integrating our health data systems.”

Rubertone also played a key role in bringing data from MHS GENESIS into DOW's surveillance systems as the electronic health record rolled out between 2017 and 2024. That work helped link information from clinics and hospitals around the world to long-standing tools such as the Defense Medical Surveillance System and the Department of Defense Serum Repository.

In creating these tools, “his visionary ideas have been a cornerstone of force health protections and readiness,” said Dr. Shauna Stahlman, deputy chief of epidemiology and analysis at AFHSD. “His leadership shows that when we preserve the past with purpose, we equip the future with possibility.”

Data-driven service provides ‘meaningful change’ for readiness

The Distinguished Civilian Service Awards are reserved each year for a small number of career civilians whose work has a department-wide impact.

The award honors a career that has shown how advanced health surveillance and secure, integrated data systems serve what DHA calls “medicine for the mission” — protecting the force, promoting health, and ensuring the military remains ready to respond.

Data, Rubertone said, “has the power to drive meaningful change, especially when it comes to public health and national security.”

At the cornerstone of his renowned career, Rubertone emphasized, is his dedication in using this data to help the warfighter. “There's a constant challenge to innovate, to adapt to evolving threats, and to find new ways to use data to improve the health and readiness of our warfighters,” he said. “I'm driven by a deep sense of service and a desire to use my skills to make a positive impact.”",https://dha.mil/-/media/Project/Images/News-Images/9438883.jpg,N,1.0,2025-12-13 00:56:32.266507

Blaine McGraw, the suspended Fort Hood doctor accused of secretly recording his patients. The probe not only includes Fort Hood, but is also looking into his previous duty stations.

As we first reported to you last month, the Army released his full service record, which spans more more than a decade. Prior to his time at Fort Hood in Killeen and at Tripler Army Medical Center in Hawaii, McGraw was a physician's assistant at Fort Campbell, Ky. before attending medical school.

25 News contacted Fort Campbell to ask if investigators are looking into his time in Kentucky. We did not get a direct answer, but the Defense Health Agency issued this statement:

“The Defense Health Agency is aware of the serious allegations involving a physician who previously worked at several military hospitals. We remain fully committed to fostering an environment of trust and safety within our health care system. Our priority is to ensure that all patients receive the safe, high-quality care they deserve in our facilities. To that end, we are conducting thorough internal reviews to ensure accountability and strengthen systemic safeguards. This includes reviewing clinical protocols, supervision mechanisms—such as the use of chaperones—and reporting and complaint procedures across the enterprise. Our goal is to maintain safe and secure environments for both our beneficiaries and personnel.”

- Defense Health Agency

The Army provided 25 News a statement about those affected by the ongoing investigation as well:

“The Army is committed to providing comprehensive support to patients potentially impacted by these allegations. To that end, we have initiated patient notifications, established a dedicated call center, assigned Special Victims Counsel, and created a patient support line to ensure those affected have access to the resources and assistance they need during this investigation, which we are committed to conducting thoroughly.

Representatives John Carter and August Pfluger, along with Senators John Cornyn and Ted Cruz, sent a letter Wednesday to Lieutenant General Gregory D. Brady, the Army's Inspector General, requesting immediate action regarding Maj. Blaine McGraw, a suspended OB-GYN who worked at the Carl R. Darnall Army Medical Center.

The lawmakers described the allegations as ""deeply disturbing"" and said they, ""raise profound concerns about clinical oversight, command accountability, and the integrity of the military health system.""

""These accusations do not reflect isolated lapses; they point to potential long-term failures,"" the letter states.

“The Army and Department of War Inspector Generals must conduct an investigation into the systemic failures that allowed Major Blaine McGraw to continue in his capacity amidst multiple accusations of egregious sexual misconduct,” said Sen. Cornyn. “The allegations made against Major McGraw and how they were mishandled warrant a thorough investigation, and I implore the Army and the Department to promptly look into this matter, bring justice to his countless victims, and work to prevent another failing in the future.”

- Sen. John Cornyn

The congressional delegation is requesting an independent investigation that extends beyond a routine internal inquiry, given that the alleged conduct may have occurred over an extended period across multiple duty stations.

The lawmakers are asking the Department of the Army Office of Inspector General to examine how clinical, command, and Defense Health Agency oversight structures failed to identify and intervene in this case.

""A transparent assessment of systemic shortcomings, and actionable recommendations to strengthen standards of care and accountability will be essential to restoring trust within the military community,"" they wrote.

The letter includes seven specific questions for the Army, including requests for:

A comprehensive investigation into all allegations involving Major McGraw

Trauma-informed resources and victim assistance programs for former patients and families

Notification of the Texas Medical Board and other state licensing authorities

Identification of systemic oversight failures

Review of Defense Health Agency Graduate Medical Education program oversight

Assessment of medical supervisors who worked with Major McGraw

Evaluation of reporting pathways for patients experiencing misconduct

The lawmakers emphasized that military health system patients ""deserve confidence that their care is provided in an environment that prioritizes safety, accountability, and professionalism.""

The letter requests that the Inspector General keep Congress informed of the Department's findings and next steps in addressing the allegations.

25 News has reached out to McGraw's attorney multiple times, but have not received a response.

The House passed the FY2026 National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA) in a 312-112 vote; 94 Democrats and 18 Republicans opposed the bill.

The NDAA includes a 3.8% pay raise for U.S. troops, blocks the Pentagon from reducing the number of U.S. troops “permanently stationed in or deployed to” Europe below 76,000 for longer than 45 days, and authorizes $400 million in annual security assistance for Ukraine, The New York Times reports.

According to Speaker of the House Mike Johnson, the bill codifies all or parts of 15 of President Trump’s executive orders, including:

Restoring America’s Fighting Force

Ending Radical and Wasteful DEI Programs

Declaring a National Emergency at the Southern Border

Securing Our Borders

Clarifying the Military’s Role in Defending U.S. Territorial Integrity

Modernizing Defense Acquisitions & Spurring Innovation

Building the Golden Dome for America

Deploying Advanced Nuclear Reactor Technologies for National Security

Restoring American Airspace Sovereignty

Unleashing American Drone Dominance

The speaker’s office also highlighted multiple “major conservative victories” the bill delivers, including:

Ends wokeness and DEI by eliminating programs, offices, and training across the Department of War (DOW).

Secures the border by expanding DOW support for Department of Homeland Security operations, National Guard deployments and National Defense Areas.

Revitalizes the defense industrial base: Grows U.S. defense manufacturing jobs, onshore critical supply chains, and expands surge capacity.

Ensures allies pay their fair share: Adds new tools to push allies to shoulder more of their own defense costs.

House Democrats had pushed for the inclusion of a provision covering the cost of in vitro fertilization (IVF) for service members and their families.

Thankfully, Speaker Johnson “intervened during final negotiations to kill that provision,” the Times reports, over concerns it would lead to the destruction of many embryos.

Speaker Johnson is entirely correct. The provision he killed would have used taxpayer money to subsidize an industry that routinely creates and discards hundreds of thousands of tiny human lives each year.

In fact, the baby-making industry (fertility clinics) destroys more human lives every year than the baby-taking (abortion) industry.

Kristi Hamrick, vice president of media and policy for Students for Life of America, applauded the speaker’s intervention.

“IVF is not an industry that deserves blanket support and funding. We can do better,” she said in a statement.

Lila Rose, president of Live Action, also thanked Speaker Johnson for “ensuring TRICARE was not used to subsidize this destruction of life.”

The House’s original version of the NDAA contained additional conservative priorities, “including a ban on the Pentagon covering [transgender] surgeries for troops. But that provision and several others were stripped out in final negotiations,” the Times notes.

Though the provision doesn’t appear in the NDAA, the Pentagon stopped fund transgender medical interventions for U.S. soldiers earlier this year after President Trump signed an executive order prohibiting transgenderism within the military.

The NDAA still includes a prohibition on biological males participating in women’s sports at U.S. military academies.

The Senate is expected to overwhelmingly approve the legislation, with President Trump signing it into law before the end of the year.

John Carter is leading a bipartisan group of lawmakers calling for an Inspector General investigation into what they describe as systemic failures in the Army’s handling of allegations against Maj. Blaine McGraw, a former Army physician accused of repeated misconduct toward service members and their families.

Carter, co-chair of the House Army Caucus and a former judge, joined Senators John Cornyn and Ted Cruz, and Rep. August Pfluger in sending a letter urging the Army Inspector General to conduct an independent, comprehensive review of the case.

“As a former judge and co-chair of the House Army Caucus, I find the allegations against Major McGraw to be an egregious breach of the trust placed in him, and the oversight failures that allowed him to continue practicing are equally alarming,” Carter said in a statement. He said the Army must determine how McGraw “was able to continue victimizing Soldiers and their families” and ensure steps are taken to prevent similar failures.

Cornyn echoed those concerns, saying the Army and the Department of War Inspector Generals “must conduct an investigation into the systemic failures that allowed Major Blaine McGraw to continue in his capacity amidst multiple accusations of egregious sexual misconduct.” He said the allegations and their alleged mishandling “warrant a thorough investigation” to bring justice to victims and prevent future lapses.

In their letter to Lieutenant General Telita Crosland Brady, the lawmakers said the accusations against McGraw raise serious questions about clinical oversight, command accountability and the integrity of the military health system. Because the alleged misconduct may stretch across multiple duty stations and time periods, they urged the Department of War to launch a review that goes beyond a “routine internal inquiry.”

The letter calls for an independent investigation into both McGraw’s actions and the Army’s prior response to complaints or warnings. Lawmakers also asked the Inspector General to examine potential breakdowns in clinical supervision, the Defense Health Agency’s oversight structure and reporting pathways for medical misconduct.

To ensure transparency, the lawmakers submitted a series of questions seeking clarity on how the Army intends to investigate previous complaints, what resources will be made available to victims, and whether state medical licensing boards have been notified. They also requested evaluations of graduate medical education supervision standards and the conduct of supervisors who worked with McGraw.

“The men and women served by the military health system deserve confidence that their care is provided in an environment that prioritizes safety, accountability and professionalism,” the letter states.

McGraw faces allegations involving more than 100 individuals across multiple states for secretly recording patients during their exams. The claims involve patients from Fort Hood, Darnall Army Medical Center and Tripler Army Medical Center in Hawaii.

""These reports are deeply concerning and indescribably horrific. I and my staff are in contact with the Army and monitoring their investigation. I'm committed to ensuring a full accounting of the facts and that justice is served,” said Sen. Ted Cruz in a statement.

If you have been waiting patiently for the official word on your 2026 paycheck, you can finally stop refreshing the Reddit feed. The numbers are in, and for the vast majority of the force, the news is pretty good, if less exciting than the last two years. As of early December 2025, the National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA) conference report has confirmed a 3.8% pay raise for active duty and reserve troops. It does track with civilian wage growth, even if it does not quite match the historic highs of the past three years.

But if you look past the headline percentage, the 2026 financial landscape is a different entity entirely. From a potential overhaul of junior enlisted pay to a TRICARE price hike that is quietly John Wick’ing your wallet, here is the no-nonsense breakdown of what is hitting your bank account next year.

The Base Pay: 3.8% (The “Standard Issue Raise”)

Let’s start with the confirmed target. Effective January 1, 2026, base pay will increase by 3.8% across the board. This number is locked in the final conference version of the defense bill announced on Dec. 7, 2025. Is it the 5.2% we saw back in 2024? No. But considering the historical average usually hovers closer to 2.5%, a 3.8% hike is designed to keep military purchasing power competitive with the private sector.

What does this mean for an E-5 with six years of service? It will translate to roughly an extra $134 per month before taxes. It won’t buy you a new Mustang (Hey! Please do not finance a Mustang at 30% APR), but it will help offset the price of beef.

The Wild Card: The Junior Enlisted “Stimulus”

Here is where the briefing gets interesting. While the 3.8% is locked and loaded, Congress, much like the late Steve Irwin, is currently wrastling with a much bigger animal: a targeted pay restructuring for grades E-1 through E-4, crikey. The House and Senate have both pushed for a targeted boost that could raise the total pay for junior troops by up to 15%, helping relieve the need for junior families to use food stamps to survive.

Before you PFCs start ordering bottle service at the club, understand that this is still in the “fog of war” phase. While the intent is there in the drafts, implementation is always the enemy. There is a strong chance this could be a “split raise,” where the standard 3.8% hits in January, and the targeted bonus (“the rest of the 15%”) doesn’t kick in until later in the fiscal year. Watch your Leave and Earnings Statement (LES) closely. Until you see that code on the printout, treat that extra cash as rumor, not as a resource.

Retirees & VA: The 2.8% COLA

For our veterans who have already hung up the uniform, the news is steady as she goes. The Social Security Administration confirmed a 2.8% Cost of Living Adjustment (COLA) effective Dec. 1, 2025. In case you are wondering, Soc Sec COLA applies to military pensions and VA disability compensation as well.

If you are rated at 100% disability (veteran only), your monthly payment is going from roughly $3,877 to almost $3,986. It is welcome, but let’s be honest: after the inflation we’ve had shoved down our throats since 2021, that extra money feels more like a band-aid on a bullet hole.

The Schoolhouse Rock (GI Bill, VR&E, & Chapter 35)

Now, if you are currently trading your uniforms and PT formation for a hoodie and sitting in a classroom, listen up. The education benefits do not follow the standard January 1st COLA timeline. The VA and DoD love to make things complicated, so here is the breakdown of what your stipend looks like as of Dec. 9, 2025.

First, address the most common misconception we see in the comment sections and emails: Your Post-9/11 GI Bill (Chapter 33) Monthly Housing Allowance does NOT go up on January 1. Even though the active duty BAH rates change in January, the VA does not update the MHA rates for students until August 1, 2026, the start of the new academic year. You are locked into the 2025-2026 academic year rates until next summer. Currently, the private school cap sits at roughly $29,920 per year, and online-only students are capped at $1,169 per month, which is half the national average.

However, if you are using VR&E (Chapter 31), your subsistence rates actually bumped up back on Oct. 1, 2025. If you haven’t checked the new pay scales, please be careful. As of Oct. 1, the full-time rate for a veteran with no dependents is $812.84 per month. If you have two dependents, that jumps to $1,188.15. Remember, if you are eligible for the Post-9/11 GI Bill, you can usually elect to get paid the Chapter 33 Post 9/11 BAH Rate (based on the zipcode of the school you attend) instead of these subsistence numbers, which is almost always more money.

For the spouses and kids using Chapter 35 (DEA), your rates also shifted at the start of the fiscal year on October 1. The full-time student rate is $1,574.00 per month. If you are going three-quarters time, that drops to $1,244.00. Finally, for the few of you still rocking the Montgomery GI Bill (Chapter 30), maybe you bought in for that $1,200 fee back in boot camp; your rates are effectively $2,518.00 a month for full-time enrollment as of Oct. 1, 2025.

Side note: The Supreme Court recently ruled in favor of Rudisill v. McDonough (April 2024), whoever paid their $1200 for Montgomery GI Bill and then forfeited it in order to obtain Post 9/11 benefits was not required to, and that it was illegal. Therefore, those affected will have time added to their educational benefits.

TRICARE and Housing

You didn’t think you were getting a raise without also getting a headache, did you? The 2026 updates come with a few roadbumps. The cost of convenience is going up at the pharmacy. If you use TRICARE Home Delivery for brand-name drugs, your copay is jumping from $38 to $44 for a 90-day supply. It is a subtle increase, but like a pebble in your shoe, you will feel it over time.

Then there is the housing situation, which finally got some much-needed clarity today. The Department of Defense released the 2026 Basic Allowance for Housing rates on December 11, 2025, confirming an average increase of 4.2% across the force. While the Pentagon is planning to deal out approximately $29.9 billion in housing allowances next year, you should probably hold off on browsing Zillow for an upgrade. That average increase varies widely by zip code; what this means is that troops in high-cost blast zones like San Diego or Norfolk might see a significant increase to match local rents, while others might see the needle barely move.

A raise is only good if the numbers check out. Do not wait until mid-January to find out if DFAS got it right. Check your MyPay account around December 19-20. That is usually when the “January 1” preview LES loads into the system. Always verify and constant vigilance; routinely go over your base pay for the month, check your tax withholdings, and for the love of all that is holy, make sure your allotments are still correct and updated. 2026 is bringing more money to the pipeline, but as always, it is on you to manage the logistics… please don’t pay 30% interest on that Mustang!

Are you on active duty but live far away from your nearest military dental clinic? Or do you need dental care that your military dental clinic can’t provide?

You should know that TRICARE offers the Active Duty Dental Program. This program allows active duty service members to get care through civilian providers under certain circumstances. The ADDP helps catch problems early and prevents them from becoming more serious.

“Knowing when to see a civilian dentist can save time and prevent complications,” said Douglas Elsesser, dental program analyst, TRICARE Health Plan, at the Defense Health Agency. “ADDP guides you to the right dental care without unnecessary delays. It helps make sure you get the care that you need, when you need it.”

Who can get care through the ADDP

The ADDP is available to all ADSMs. It also covers National Guard and Reserve members who are on active duty for more than 30 consecutive days. Some members in early activation, the Transitional Assistance Management Program, or in line of duty status also qualify.

How you get care depends on where you’re stationed and if you’re remotely located.

CONUS:

You’re remotely located if you live and work more than 50 miles away from a military dental clinic.

Not remote? You can see a civilian dentist through the ADDP with a referral from your military dental clinic.

OCONUS: You must be enrolled in TRICARE Prime Remote Overseas.

When to use civilian dental care

Military dental clinics are the main providers of dental care for ADSMs. However, they can’t always provide every type of treatment. Also, not every service member is stationed close to one. In those cases, the ADDP lets you see a civilian dentist at no cost, as long as you follow the ADDP rules.

You may be eligible to see a civilian dentist through ADDP in two situations:

Remote locations: You’re assigned to a duty station more than 50 miles from a military dental clinic.

Care unavailable at your military dental clinic: Your military dental clinic doesn’t offer the dental services you need and will refer you out.

Getting an Appointment Control Number

Before scheduling with a civilian dentist, you’ll need an Appointment Control Number.

An ACN allows TRICARE to pay for your civilian dental visit under the ADDP. You must have one before getting care outside a military dental clinic.

If you already have an authorization or referral: Your authorization letter will list your ACN. You can find this letter in your ADDP My Account.

If you don’t have an authorization or referral: You may still be able to request your own ACN for routine dental care. The needed care must meet these criteria:

It’s a covered benefit.

It costs less than $750 per procedure or appointment.

It totals no more than $1,500 in a 12-month period.

It’s scheduled with a network dentist (CONUS).

Do you need specialty care? Or do your costs exceed these limits? You’ll need authorization from your civilian dentist, as described in the Active Duty Dental Program Handbook. You can find more details on ACNs and other program rules in the handbook.

How to request an ACN

Submit an ACN Request Form online (fastest option, CONUS only).

Call the ADDP contractor, United Concordia, at 866-984-2337 (CONUS) or 844-653-4058 (OCONUS).

How to make an appointment with a civilian dentist

Once you have an ACN, here’s what to do:

If you’re in a CONUS location:

You can schedule an appointment with a network dentist. United Concordia can help you. Do you have a referral? Your military dental clinic can also schedule your appointment.

If you’re in an OCONUS location:

Call United Concordia for help finding a TRICARE OCONUS Preferred Dentist. A TOPD will:

Submit pre-authorizations before you get costly or complex treatment

New tool for military dental care: findDHA

If you aren’t using the ADDP for civilian care, you’ll go to a military dental clinic. The Defense Health Agency recently launched findDHA, an interactive mapping tool. This tool can help you find the closest military dental clinic for routine care.

ADDP vs. other TRICARE dental programs

Are you a family member, retiree, or service member who isn’t on active duty? You won’t get care through the ADDP. You can buy dental coverage through a different program.

More than 20,000 children of active-duty military service members have been diagnosed with autism. Yet for years, the health plan for these families, TRICARE, has refused to cover one of the most effective treatments for autism spectrum disorder as a basic benefit — a therapy known as applied behavior analysis, or ABA.

Families and clinicians have long been mystified, even outraged, by the military's stance on this issue. Last month, the prestigious National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine joined their ranks.

In a new 310-page report, the National Academies concluded that ABA is a medically necessary therapy that should be offered to all children of military members who need it. The report went so far as to say, ""Scientific evidence indicates that ABA is an appropriate intervention to support health outcomes for autistic individuals.""

It's time for the Department of Defense to acknowledge this obvious truth and give military families the essential medical support they deserve.

ABA uses scientifically based insights and techniques to promote positive behavior — and discourage problematic behavior — in children with autism. The medical and scientific communities have acknowledged its benefits for years.

A recent review of the scientific literature in the journal Research in Autism Spectrum Disorders concluded that ""ABA programs are moderately to highly effective bringing significant benefits for children with ASD.""

As far back as 1999, the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services recognized ABA as the gold standard in autism care.

The Department of Defense, however, has been unconvinced. It was only in 2014 that TRICARE began offering ABA to families as part of a ""demonstration program"" aimed at studying the therapy's effectiveness.

That demonstration is still up and running — and currently provides about 16,000 military families with ABA services.

Yet more than a decade after the program launched, the Department of Defense continues to insist that ABA falls short of the evidence standards required for coverage under TRICARE.

This claim flies in the face of years of established scientific research — and now the new report from the National Academies.

Nearly four years ago, Congress tasked the independent committee of experts behind the new study with evaluating TRICARE's ABA demonstration. They concluded that ""ABA fits DOD’s Criteria for Reliable Evidence of Proven Medical Effectiveness.""

The report goes on to recommend, in no uncertain terms, that ""The Defense Health Agency should discontinue the Comprehensive Autism Care Demonstration (ACD) and authorize coverage of applied behavior analysis (ABA) as a Basic benefit under the TRICARE program.""

But it doesn't stop there. The committee also finds that the DOD's demonstration program has needlessly obstructed access to ABA for military families. And it implores the Defense Health Agency to ""take steps to ensure that administrative processes do not impede access to care.""

In short, this expert panel has corroborated what autism advocates and military families have known for years. The DOD has deliberately restricted access to medically necessary care for military-connected children. And it has inflicted enormous harm on service members and their families in doing so.

Active-duty armed services members sacrifice every day for the safety and security of our nation. Denying necessary medical care to these Americans — as well as to their children — is shameful.

It shouldn't have taken an expert report to point out this fact. But now that the NASEM has made plain the military's negligence, the Department of Defense should waste little time in correcting its mistake — and making ABA a basic health benefit for active-duty military families.",https://bloximages.newyork1.vip.townnews.com/nola.com/content/tncms/assets/v3/editorial/3/59/359214c1-9395-49e1-ad95-e2e92d608c3f/692761879aecc.image.jpg?crop=799%2C420%2C0%2C80,N,0.0,2025-12-12 12:56:34.376327

It means a great deal to me — not just as an individual achievement — but as validation of the importance of public health data and health IT in supporting our nation's warfighters.” The award is DOW’s highest recognition for career civilian employees whose work improves the efficiency and impact of the entire department. Describing Rubertone as an “icon in the Military Health System,” DHA Public Health Deputy Director Sean Friendly said, “His development of the Defense Military Surveillance System has tracked every military member medical encounter since 1997. This system is critical to execute comprehensive health surveillance on our military family.” Rubertone said the award is “truly a reflection of the incredible team I've been fortunate to work with throughout my career and in particular during the past 10 years at DHA. The success we've achieved is entirely attributable to their expertise, dedication, and unwavering commitment to our mission.” Modernizing health data for readiness As functional IT support chief, Rubertone led teams to upgrade tools used for tracking the burden of disease, injury, and illness among beneficiaries across the Military Health System. Those systems helped public health experts study trends ranging from musculoskeletal injuries to COVID-19 and measure the effectiveness of prevention and treatment efforts. The data collected was vital for leaders in Congress, the Department, and the Department of Health and Human Services to set policy and allocate services. “Over 30 years ago, Dr. Rubertone created several important tools for military force health protection and readiness that are widely used today,” said Navy Capt. Carlos Williams, deputy chief of AFHSD. “The impact of these tools on warfighter readiness comes from how they are used to track, interpret, validate, and communicate essential health threats that directly affect the force.” Rubertone underscored his commitment to warfighter lethality, stating, “My work, at its core, is about ensuring our warfighters are healthy, protected, and ready to answer the call of duty. We accomplish this by providing data and tools necessary to identify threats to their health, track injury and illness trends, and measure the effectiveness of preventive measures.” Air Force Col. Cecilia Session, chief of AFHSD’s epidemiology and analysis branch, highlighted Rubertone’s ability at translating complex data into clear, reliable information for commanders and policymakers. “His unique skill set allows him to act as the bridge over the gap between information technology and public health epidemiology,” she said. “As the DHA’s systems evolve to incorporate advances in information technology, he is the vanguard of modernizing and integrating our health data systems.” Rubertone also played a key role in bringing data from MHS GENESIS into DOW's surveillance systems as the electronic health record rolled out between 2017 and 2024. That work helped link information from clinics and hospitals around the world to long-standing tools such as the Defense Medical Surveillance System and the Department of Defense Serum Repository. In creating these tools, “his visionary ideas have been a cornerstone of force health protections and readiness,” said Dr. Shauna Stahlman, deputy chief of epidemiology and analysis at AFHSD. “His leadership shows that when we preserve the past with purpose, we equip the future with possibility.” Data-driven service provides ‘meaningful change’ for readiness The Distinguished Civilian Service Awards are reserved each year for a small number of career civilians whose work has a department-wide impact. The award honors a career that has shown how advanced health surveillance and secure, integrated data systems serve what DHA calls “medicine for the mission” — protecting the force, promoting health, and ensuring the military remains ready to respond. Data, Rubertone said, “has the power to drive meaningful change, especially when it comes to public health and national security.” At the cornerstone of his renowned career, Rubertone emphasized, is his dedication in using this data to help the warfighter. “There's a constant challenge to innovate, to adapt to evolving threats, and to find new ways to use data to improve the health and readiness of our warfighters,” he said. “I'm driven by a deep sense of service and a desire to use my skills to make a positive impact.”",https://d1ldvf68ux039x.cloudfront.net/thumbs/photos/2512/9438883/1000w_q95.jpg,N,0.0,2025-12-12 10:56:24.105866

Darnall Army Medical Center (CRDAMC) on Tuesday, the medical center at Fort Hood at the center of an investigation where suspended OB-GYN Maj. Blaine McGraw is accused of secretly video recording his patients during exams.

The Under Secretary of the Army, the Honorable Mike Obadal, and Army Surgeon General Lt. Gen. Mary K. Izaguirre visited CRDAMC to review the Defense Health Agency policies and the implementation of them in Army medical facilities, as well as survey patient safety practices, protective safeguards, management standards, and overall care quality.

Rear Adm. Matthew Case, acting deputy director of DHA, also accompanied the leaders on their visit.

""Our ethical and moral imperative is to ensure deployment-ready forces while providing a safe and professional environment for all patients. When our soldiers and our families visit a military medical treatment facility, they place enormous trust in the providers and the system. I’m proud of our leaders and medical providers for the swift action taken to initiate the criminal investigation and prioritize patient safety – all of which reflects their unwavering commitment to patient care and Army readiness.”

- Honorable Mike Obadal, Under Secretary of the U.S. Army

During their visit, Lt. Gen. Izaguirre reinforced institutional accountability as a basis of the U.S. Army's healthcare system.

“We are looking closely at how training is conducted, how standards are enforced and how leaders ensure that policies are being followed. Based on this review, we will work with the DHA to implement any necessary recommendations quickly and transparently to maintain faith with soldiers and families.”

- Army Surgeon General Lt. Gen. Mary K. Izaguirre

In a press release from the U.S. Army regarding the visit, it said these actions will occur in conjunction with an Army-directed Inspector General review of medical treatment policies and practices.

Company A, 58th Transportation Battalion, first joined the club in April by having 118 Soldiers volunteer to donate blood to the Armed Services Blood Program. They repeated this success with 121 donors in June; 132 in August; and 119 in October. In total, 503 Soldiers — nearly 40% of their available class population — volunteered to give the gift of life.

During a six-week course, Alpha Company trains Soldiers to be truck drivers. Coordinating a large-scale ASBP blood drive required precise timing, according to Capt. William Breceda Cooper, Company A commander.

“We reviewed each class’s arrival and departure dates to find when the most Soldiers would be available,” he said. “Once we identified the best time, we scheduled the drive and motivated the Soldiers to donate.”

Breceda Cooper credits awareness and engaged leadership as key factors in the company’s success.

“Many Soldiers don’t know about the ASBP,” he said. “Sharing information and having senior leaders encourage donations makes a big difference.”

He also emphasized the importance of personal stories from cadre about times they or their families needed blood.

“Blood donations saved my father’s life in Afghanistan in 2006,” he shared.

Since then, Breceda Cooper said he has tried to donate whenever he has a chance.

The Fort Leonard Wood Blood Donor Center has held several blood drives in 2025, averaging about three dozen volunteers each. Company A’s drive nearly quadruples that number, which Lynee Miller, donor center supervisor, finds very encouraging.

“It’s inspiring to see young men and women donate for a cause bigger than themselves, especially with leadership’s support,” she said. “Their generosity helps many people fight illness and injury.”

The 100-Donor Club recognizes organizations that have 100 or more eligible donors volunteer during a single-day blood drive. There are currently 31 members. Each member has their unit’s name, donor counts, and drive dates etched on a plaque hanging in the donor center lobby. They also receive a Giving 4 Living streamer from the Association of the United States Army.

The ASBP, the official blood provider for the U.S. military, ensures a steady supply of blood products is available for service members worldwide. The military health system requires hundreds of blood units each day and looks to the ASPB to ensure they’re available. The ASBP then relies on volunteer donors to meet those ongoing demands.

“This milestone makes me proud of my team—senior NCOs who facilitate, encourage, and motivate Soldiers,” Breceda Cooper said. “It also highlights the selfless sacrifice of the Soldiers who donated. Their actions show they’re part of something greater than themselves. Donating blood is a small act that can save lives.”

For more information about the Armed Services Blood Program, the 100-Donor Club, or to schedule a blood drive, call 573.596.6150.

About the Armed Services Blood Program:

Since 1962, the ASBP has been the U.S. military’s official blood program. Its mission is to provide quality blood products and support to military healthcare worldwide—on the battlefield and in hospitals. The ASBP collects, processes, stores, transports, and distributes blood to service members, their families, retirees, and veterans in peace and war. Working with Military Health Affairs, the Defense Health Agency, Service Blood Programs, and Combatant Commands, the ASBP follows common goals, metrics, and procedures to shape the future of military blood support.

As one of four organizations responsible for a safe blood supply, the ASBP also collaborates with civilian partners to maximize blood availability nationally.",https://api.army.mil/e2/c/images/2025/12/11/eca401c2/max1200.jpg,N,0.0,2025-12-11 16:56:26.173109

TRICARE-covered services TRICARE covers a variety of mental health services. These include: • Outpatient • Inpatient • Emergency • Nonemergency • Substance use disorder services

Virtual mental health services have the same referral and pre-authorization requirements as in-person mental health care.

Getting virtual mental health care Civilian care in the U.S. Are you seeking virtual mental health care in the U.S.? You can contact your regional contractor to find a provider who offers these services: • East Region: o Call Humana Military at 800-444-5445. o Find a virtual health provider: East Region Virtual Health Network Partners. • West Region: o Call TriWest Healthcare Alliance at 888-TRIWEST (874-9378). o Find a virtual health provider: West Region Virtual Health Network Partners.

Military hospital or clinic mental health services If you get care at a military hospital or clinic, you may be able to get virtual mental health services there. Contact your provider for more information. If you’re an active duty service member, you need a referral and pre-authorization from your primary care manager.

Behavioral Health Resources and Virtual Experience In certain locations, the Defense Health Agency’s Behavioral Health Resources and Virtual Experience, or BRAVE, helps get patients quicker access to mental health resources. BRAVE supports local mental health services with video appointments at facilities where mental health services may be in short supply.

BRAVE is primarily for active duty service members. Overseas, it’s also available to adult active duty family members. BRAVE began with 16 military hospitals and clinics and has since expanded to 84 locations in the U.S., Europe, and Indo-Pacific, with plans to add more.

Overseas Do you live outside the U.S.? You can still use virtual mental health services if: • The care is a TRICARE-covered benefit and is appropriate for virtual health. • The country where you get care allows virtual health. • The provider is TRICARE-authorized and has a license to practice in the country where you get care. (Note: U.S.-based providers aren’t eligible to provide virtual health visits overseas.) • The provider knows your location and how to contact help in a medical or mental health emergency. • The provider follows all local health care and virtual health rules.

TRICARE will cover your virtual health care if you meet these requirements. Contact your TRICARE Overseas Program Regional Call Center to see if you need a referral and to find a provider who offers virtual visits.

TRICARE For Life and Medicare Do you have TRICARE For Life? You may have heard that Medicare has recently changed its virtual health coverage. As of Oct. 1, 2025, you must be in an office or medical facility located in a rural area (in the U.S.) for most virtual health services. However, you can still get virtual mental health services (including substance use disorder services) from your home.

Remember to check what Medicare and TRICARE cover before scheduling an appointment. TRICARE pays first if Medicare doesn’t cover a service.

What you need To use virtual mental health services, you need: • A computer or smartphone (for video care) • A telephone (for telephone-only care) • A secure phone or internet connection • Referrals or pre-authorizations (if required)

Costs Virtual health costs are similar to in-person costs. Your costs depend on who you are, your health plan, and your type of appointment. Note that you’ll need to pay your usual cost-shares and copayments for virtual visits.

Early fleet deployment strengthens operational readiness and accelerates the Navy’s transition to next-generation medical technology.

WASHINGTON--(BUSINESS WIRE)--The USS Carney (DDG 64) has officially gone live with T6 Health Systems’ OpMed Care Delivery Platform (CDP), marking a significant advancement in the Navy’s modernization of shipboard medical technology. The new commercial off-the-shelf solution replaces a longstanding electronic health record system and introduces a more agile, mission-ready capability designed to support the realities of care in maritime and contested environments.

As one of the Navy’s earliest implementation sites, Carney will play a critical role in shaping the evolution of OpMed CDP across the fleet. Feedback from medical personnel and operational users will drive rapid refinement cycles and guide deployment strategy as the Navy scales a more resilient, data-driven approach to operational medicine.

OpMed CDP is engineered to provide care teams with a clear, real-time operating picture -streamlining documentation, integrating essential clinical data, sharpening decision making, and enabling health information to move seamlessly with the patient. These advances strengthen readiness and improve continuity of care in the dynamic scenarios faced by sailors and medical staff underway.

""The Navy operates in some of the most demanding environments in the world, and sailors deserve medical technology built for that mission,” said Igor Muravyov, Chief Operating Officer at T6 Health Systems. “The USS Carney’s deployment of OpMed CDP reflects the Department of War’s commitment to modernizing shipboard medicine and ensuring that warfighters have the most advanced technologies to enhance lethality of our forces everywhere.”

The deployment aboard Carney adds to a period of significant growth and momentum for T6 Health Systems. In recent weeks, T6’s technology has gone live at the White House, Brooke Army Medical Center and Al Dhafra Air Base - demonstrating the platform’s versatility across global operational and executive care environments. The company was also recently awarded a multi-year agreement with the Defense Health Agency and PEO DHMS to further configure its commercial offering as a secure, cloud-enabled capability supporting the next generation of operational medicine. These milestones underscore T6’s expanding role as a key technology partner in advancing modern, interoperable solutions across the Military Health System.

A GOP-issued summary of the legislation says the NDAA authorizes $291 billion for maintenance and operations; $234 billion for military personnel and health care; $162 billion for procurement; $146 billion for research and development; $34 billion for nuclear defense programs; and $20 billion for military construction and family housing.
That includes over $2.7 billion in essential military construction projects and expands in that region.
It permanently repeals all existing Defense Department diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI) offices, programs, training and activities, as well as future DEI-related endeavors.

The final version includes and also left out key provisions after months of negotiations by lawmakers on Capitol Hill.

The 3,086-page bill passed the House on a 312-112 vote (115 Democrats, 197 Republicans voted in favor) with Republicans and Democrats finding enough common ground to forward the legislation to the Senate—where it is expected to pass the GOP-controlled chamber and then be signed by President Donald Trump.

This year’s NDAA, passed annually by Congress, appropriates large amounts of funding that will impact the departments of Defense and Energy, health care, troops and salaries, research and development, immigration at the U.S.-Mexico border, collective bargaining, and diversity initiatives. Not all lawmakers got what they wanted but high-ranking committee members expressed mostly positive sentiments after the bill’s passing.

“This is a strong bipartisan bill that delivers for our warfighters and deters our adversaries,” House Armed Services Committee Chairman Mike Rogers (R-AL) said on the House floor prior to the bill’s passing. “It will fundamentally reform the defense acquisition enterprise. It will continue historic improvements in the quality of life for our servicemembers and their families.

“It will build the ready, capable, and lethal fighting force we need to deter China and our other adversaries. And it will deliver on President Trump’s Peace Through Strength agenda. I urge all members to support it.”

Rep. Adam Smith (D-WA), the ranking Democrat on the committee, called the bill “the most ambitious swing at acquisition reform that we’ve taken,” according to the Associated Press.

“This NDAA falls short. Trump and [Defense Secretary Pete] Hegseth are deploying troops to our streets, carrying out extrajudicial killings, and undermining our military readiness. Congress must reassert its oversight. We need accountability—not just handouts to Trump,” said Rep. John Garamendi (D-CA), a senior Armed Services Committee member, in a post on X.

Big Money

The House-passed bill in part authorizes some military construction projects and extends their authorization from previous fiscal years; requires the Department of Defense to develop a national strategy on the security implications of emerging biotechnologies; requires the Navy to implement certain processes to improve combat readiness of surface ships maintained and repaired at private shipyards; and extends the Pacific Deterrence Initiative which designed to enhance U.S. deterrence and defense posture in the Indo-Pacific region.

A GOP-issued summary of the legislation says the NDAA authorizes $291 billion for maintenance and operations; $234 billion for military personnel and health care; $162 billion for procurement; $146 billion for research and development; $34 billion for nuclear defense programs; and $20 billion for military construction and family housing.

Lawmakers say the FY 2026 bill overall will save taxpayers nearly $20 billion, including $40.5 million from eliminating DEI activities; $1.6 billion in cuts to climate change-related spending; $1.2 billion from retiring obsolete aircraft and ships; $6.8 billion from reductions in “unnecessary Pentagon bureaucracy”; $5.5 billion in cuts to consulting and service contracts; and $3.7 billion in cuts to inefficient defense programs.

NDAA’s Major Inclusions

Some of the NDAA’s major highlights are as follows:

A 3.8% pay raise for all military servicemembers, in addition to reauthorizing and expanding military bonuses and special pays; increases family separation allowance for deployed servicemembers; and requires a study to improve the calculation of Basic Allowance for Housing to ensure it keeps up with rising rental costs.

$400 million for Ukraine security assistance.

It extends the Pacific Deterrence Initiative (PDI) to improve U.S. posture in the Indo-Pacific region, including funding increases for new technologies needed to deter China such as hypersonic missiles, AI, autonomous systems, cyber, mobile micronuclear reactors, and high energy lasers. That includes over $2.7 billion in essential military construction projects and expands in that region.

Full funding ($1 billion) towards the Taiwan Security Cooperation Initiative.

$1.5 billion in new security assistance for the Philippines.

It formally establishes and authorizes $175 million for the Baltic Security Initiative to strengthen the defensive capability and interoperability of the Baltic states.

Full funding for the deployment of National Guard and active-duty troops in support of border patrol at the United States’ southwest border, including over $1 billion to fight drug trafficking ($398 million for Defense Department support of counter-narcotics operations and $216 million for National Guard counter-drug programs—$100 million over the budget request).

Reforms to military construction that costs 35% more on average than commercial construction, including accelerating construction and reducing costs by granting military departments multiyear contracting authority and authorizing the use of accelerated design-build and progressive design-build contracting methods to cut costs and speed up projects.

Oversight of Defense Department spending by way of fully funding the department’s Inspector General audit activities and requiring the department to submit quarterly reports to Congress on the status of balances and activities of funds previously approved within the One Big Beautiful Bill Act earlier this year.

More than $131 million for the construction of new military dining facilities and over $1.5 billion for new construction of barracks and family housing.

More than $335 million to renovate military hospitals and build new medical facilities, which includes better access to specialty care by lowering the threshold for travel reimbursement for medical appointments from 100 to 75 miles.

More than $491 million to design and build new childcare centers, including annual reviews of childcare costs and a pilot program to increase childcare financial assistance in high-cost areas.

More than $206 million to build new schools for children of servicemembers and allows National Guard and reserve members called to active duty to enroll their children in Defense Department schools. It also authorizes $50 million in Impact Aid assistance to public schools with military dependent students, and an additional $20 million in assistance to local schools teaching children with severe disabilities.

It extends military recruitment bonuses.

It prohibits the retirement of certain F-15E, A-10, C-130, E-3, RQ-4, and Grey Eagle aircraft, as well as the closure of the E-7A Wedgetail production line.

$26 billion in shipbuilding funding for the construction and support of numerous vessels including the third Columbia-class Ballistic Missile Submarine, one Virginia-class Submarine, one anti-submarine warfare auxiliary ship, and future procurements.

More than $38 billion for the development, procurement or modification of aircraft including full funding for the U.S. Air Force’s F-47 and Navy’s F/A-XX 6th Generation Aircraft programs.

Builds the “Golden Dome” to update national missile defense policy.

What's Not in the Bill

Some of what was excluded in the final version are as follows:

The final bill ultimately did not include a provision mandating health care coverage for assisted reproductive technology, including in vitro fertilization (IVF), for all active-duty service members. As previously reported by Military.com, some Democrats and numerous reproductive organizations warned prior to the final version that its removal would prevent the expansion of IVF access to all servicemembers due to current insurance plans through TRICARE.

It permanently repeals all existing Defense Department diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI) offices, programs, training and activities, as well as future DEI-related endeavors.

It cuts climate change-related programs at the Defense Department.

It removes Section 1110, the bipartisan House provision that would have restored collective bargaining rights for the Defense Department’s civilian workforce and would have prevented the department from using the bill’s funds to enforce an executive order that strips collective bargaining rights from hundreds of thousands of DoD civilians.

Rep. Bob Onder (R-MO), urged GOP colleagues in November to strip the provision from the final call, saying in an X post that it was “designed to stop union bosses from slowing down critical defense operations by pushing ineffective policies that hurt productivity” and would cause “political interference.”

Hegseth’s Travel Budget Tied to Caribbean Boat Strikes

The House-passed version also includes a provision to withhold a quarter of Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth’s travel budget until the Pentagon provides Congress with unedited videos of Caribbean airstrikes against alleged drug smuggling boats, according to reports.

It was included on the heels of the ongoing controversy surrounding orders to allegedly kill two survivors from a Sept. 2 strike, and further investigations by GOP-led House and Senate committees into whether that second strike was properly authorized and amounted to war crimes. The investigations remain ongoing.

Codifying Trump's Executive Orders

The NDAA also codifies all or parts of 15 executive orders issued by President Trump, including the following:

Restoring America's Fighting Force (EO 14185)

Ending Radical and Wasteful Government Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion (DEI) Programs and Preferencing (EO 14151)

Declaring a National Emergency at the Southern Border (Proclamation 10886)

Securing Our Borders (EO 14165)

Clarifying the Military's Role in Protecting the Territorial Integrity of the U.S. (EO 14167)

Modernizing Defense Acquisitions and Spurring Innovation in the Defense Industrial Base (EO 14265)

Building the Golden Dome for America (EO 14186)

Deploying Advanced Nuclear Reactor Technologies for National Security (EO 14299)

Restoring American Airspace Sovereignty (EO 14305)

Unleashing American Drone Dominance (EO 14307)

BETHESDA, Md. – Walter Reed National Military Medical Center’s new approach to medical care begins with Walter’s Way and continues with the voices of those who use it every day. This model is transforming the patient and staff experience through improved flexibility, easier access to care, and a renewed focus on whole-person wellness.

Several clinical departments, including Primary Care, Pediatrics, and Dermatology, have already adopted the Walter’s Way model. As these areas shift to more proactive care, they are also implementing new tools to gather direct feedback from patients and staff. This feedback is a cornerstone of Walter’s Way by helping teams evaluate what is working well, identifying opportunities for improvements, and strengthening the overall care experience.

To support continuous improvement, a dedicated Walter’s Way feedback form is now available for patients and families to share their experiences. Whether the feedback highlights success, points out a challenge, or suggests a new idea, every response plays a meaningful role in shaping the future of patient care at Walter Reed.

“We've had some positive feedback,” said U.S. Army Lt. Col. Elizabeth Simmons, Deputy Director for the Department of Medicine and Primary Care lead for Walter’s Way. “Families have even written in, or patients have written in comments to give great feedback about some of our Walter’s Way staff.”

As the hospital continues to refine and expand Walter’s Way, leadership remains committed to transparency, patient-centered care, and open communication. All patients and staff are encouraged to stay engaged, share insights, and help guide the evolution of this model.",https://cdn.dvidshub.net/images/dvids_logo.svg,N,0.0,2025-12-11 14:56:27.278130

TRICARE currently does not cover IVF or other assisted reproductive technologies.

The provision’s elimination mirrored a similar removal from last year’s defense bill and came amid opposition from pro-life advocates, who argued that standard IVF practices involve the creation and destruction of human embryos, making taxpayer funding unethical. The industry has faced criticism for operating with little oversight, leading to the discard of tens of thousands of so-called “excess” embryos annually – essentially human beings who are killed.

House Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., drew credit from conservative groups for blocking the measure, which some Senate Republicans had labeled a “poison pill” during negotiations.

“This victory shows us a sensitivity to that,” said Frank Pavone, national director of Priests for Life, referring to widespread moral concerns about IVF. “The people I’ve talked to in the administration have said very explicitly, you know, these concerns have been heard, these moral concerns.”

Kristi Hamrick, vice president of media and policy for Students for Life of America, called the removal a step toward better alternatives. “IVF is not an industry that deserves blanket support and funding. We can do better,” she said.

Hamrick added that the process destroys “far more lives than are allowed to live and thrive,” and that “more pre-born lives are lost in IVF than abortion.”

“Unquestioning financial support props up an industry known to prey on people’s hopes for a child while ending many lives,” Hamrick said. “The move to pull the funding for IVF will free up resources to seek better answers.”

Lila Rose, president of Live Action, thanked Johnson for “ensuring TRICARE was not used to subsidize this destruction of life.”

The bill’s passage caps a year of debate over fertility coverage, fueled in part by campaign pledges including one from President-elect Donald Trump to expand IVF access nationwide. Pro-life groups framed the removal not as a setback for military families but as a principled choice to prioritize methods that avoid embryo destruction.",https://www.lifenews.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/senate4.jpg,N,0.0,2025-12-11 14:56:31.791214

The military provides a continuum of care for service members and families who may face unique mental health challenges coping with daily life. This means the right resource is out there to match warfighters and families to the care they need.

“The wonderful thing in the Department of War is that we have a lot of different modalities, and so we can individualize treatment and find out what is going to work best for them,” said Navy Capt. (Dr.) Elle Marie Schollnberger, a psychiatrist and director of mental health for the Office of the Assistant Secretary of War for Health Services Policy and Oversight.

Personalized care can strengthen resilience and improve overall health, said Dr. Marjan Holloway a clinical psychologist and the director of the Suicide Care, Prevention, and Research initiative at the Uniformed Services University in Bethesda, Maryland, adding that mental health care is “delivered in the context of what is the best evidence there is for the treatment that's being provided.”

Military Health System is there for you wherever and whenever you need help

Therapy can take many forms, such as nonmedical, toll-free advice, nurse advice lines, and lifestyle coaching to provide support and connect with professionals before issues become severe. Along the spectrum of care, support can include interactive mental therapy, medications, and hospitalization, if needed. The MHS Mental Health Hub provides information on resources that can be accessed around the world 24/7, and via telehealth.

The care and prevention components come together “such as that we all work as a team and do a better job in the context of suicide prevention,” Holloway said. “While sometimes, it is a one-on-one setting, there are people all around you that are willing to help, be they a barracks buddy, platoon leader, or a volunteer on a free 24/7 telephone line dedicated to helping military mental health.”

The aim of these efforts is to make military life fulfilling at a high level.

“Allow our mental health clinics and other professionals like Military and Family Life counselors, Military OneSource, and all those other support agencies to serve you and make you a better version of you,” said Air Force Tech. Sgt. Jacob Cote, a mental health flight chief at Joint Base Anacostia-Bolling in Washington, D.C.

To reach that better version, you have to give these military support programs “that chance,” Cote said. If you don’t feel comfortable with the first or second resource or program, “That’s OK, there are other resources service members can utilize, too.”

MHS mental health professionals emphasize a ready military force must be at its best physically and mentally to be most effective in action.

“The human weapon system is one of the most valuable systems that we have in the United States,” observed Air Force Tech. Sgt. Martina MooreTerry, also a mental health flight chief at Joint Base Andrews, Maryland. “Mental health and readiness go hand in hand in the military.”

Mental health professionals are “ready to take care of that fight downrange, ready to take care of those individuals in their hardest and darkest of times,” she added.

“If an individual doesn’t take care of their mental health, and only focuses on the physical aspect — how can we expect them to go out and perform their duties, day in and day out? If one is not psychologically resilient, the DOW is at risk of failing, and readiness could be directly impacted,” concurred Cote.

Service members may find themselves hesitant to take the first step toward mental health support. “Being hesitant is normal. I cannot stress that enough,” said Cote. “It is OK to feel hesitant. It is OK to feel cautiously optimistic. It is OK to wonder if it will help you. Let us show you that it can and does work.”

According to Schollnberger, there are a variety of therapy types that can help. Individual therapies available at military clinics include cognitive behavioral therapy, prolonged exposure therapy, or psychoanalysis. There are also group therapies, which “can be very beneficial for individuals to have an understanding that they're not alone in what they're facing and really get support from the group,” she explained.

There are other ways to learn coping … we also have virtual therapy. So, for those folks in remote locations, we do have the ability to make sure they have access to therapy as well,” she noted.

Nonmedical resources are also available and are ideal to look at or consult with if a service member or family member thinks they may need mental health help, said Navy Cmdr. Stephanie Long, a clinical and medical psychologist, U.S. Navy director for psychological health.

“I think partially because when we think about mental health and mental health care, a lot of times we think straight to the clinic or the military treatment facility and the specialty mental health care that is there, but there are tons of other resources that can still provide care,” Long said. For example, she noted, are Military and Family Life counselors and chaplains who are often trained in pastoral care.

With Military and Family Life counselors, “they’re confidential to a point just like mental health, but they have the ability to meet you where you're at on base and do not document what is discussed,” Cote said. The first step can be to ”shop around, for example, living in the National Capital Region, there are tons of resources to best fit your needs,” Cote stressed.

He noted that mental health professionals are skilled at ""meeting you where you’re at on your mental health journey, coming to your level, and showing you that ‘I'm here for you while you are on this journey’ and that it is OK to not be OK.”

If you’re still unsure about which resources to try — or feeling emotional distress — Cote said “call your local mental health clinic. They will be able to help match you with the most appropriate resource.”

The new commercial off-the-shelf solution replaces a longstanding electronic health record system and introduces a more agile, mission-ready capability designed to support the realities of care in maritime and contested environments.

As one of the Navy’s earliest implementation sites, Carney will play a critical role in shaping the evolution of OpMed CDP across the fleet. Feedback from medical personnel and operational users will drive rapid refinement cycles and guide deployment strategy as the Navy scales a more resilient, data-driven approach to operational medicine.

OpMed CDP is engineered to provide care teams with a clear, real-time operating picture -streamlining documentation, integrating essential clinical data, sharpening decision making, and enabling health information to move seamlessly with the patient. These advances strengthen readiness and improve continuity of care in the dynamic scenarios faced by sailors and medical staff underway.

""The Navy operates in some of the most demanding environments in the world, and sailors deserve medical technology built for that mission,” said Igor Muravyov, Chief Operating Officer at T6 Health Systems. “The USS Carney’s deployment of OpMed CDP reflects the Department of War’s commitment to modernizing shipboard medicine and ensuring that warfighters have the most advanced technologies to enhance lethality of our forces everywhere.”

The deployment aboard Carney adds to a period of significant growth and momentum for T6 Health Systems. In recent weeks, T6’s technology has gone live at the White House, Brooke Army Medical Center and Al Dhafra Air Base - demonstrating the platform’s versatility across global operational and executive care environments. The company was also recently awarded a multi-year agreement with the Defense Health Agency and PEO DHMS to further configure its commercial offering as a secure, cloud-enabled capability supporting the next generation of operational medicine. These milestones underscore T6’s expanding role as a key technology partner in advancing modern, interoperable solutions across the Military Health System.

My fiancée, who is a Military Dependant on Tricare Select, is currently pregnant. We are wondering if the newborn is covered by Tricare a certain amount of days, while my employer gets everything straight with the paperwork and insurance mombojumbo to get the newborn covered under my employers plan.

While I support several important components of this legislation, I could not in good conscience vote for the bill in its entirety.
The FY26 NDAA authorizes over $890 billion in additional Pentagon spending.
""Despite these important provisions, this legislation exacerbates an already over-bloated Pentagon budget and funds several defense policies which will not make people any safer.
This is why I could not support its final passage.""","WASHINGTON – Today, U.S. Representative Jan Schakowsky released the following statement after voting against final passage of the Fiscal Year 2026 National Defense Authorization Act (FY26 NDAA):

""Today, I once again voted against passage of the Republican’s National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA). While I support several important components of this legislation, I could not in good conscience vote for the bill in its entirety. The FY26 NDAA authorizes over $890 billion in additional Pentagon spending. That is $8 billion more than the Pentagon itself said it needed. Our greatest security threats have no military solutions, and it is time our budget reflects that. We must instead make the investments in health care, education, housing, clean air and water, and public transit that Americans deserve.

“Further, this legislation removed House-passed provisions that would lead to In vitro fertilization (IVF) coverage under TRICARE and restore collective bargaining rights to civilian employees. I was also discouraged to see that the bill still discriminates against the transgender community. With this year’s illegal military strikes against innocent boats in the Caribbean, the last thing we need to do is give the Pentagon even more power.

""Although I opposed this bill, there were several bright spots, including a 3.8% pay raise for all service members, the repeal of the 1991 and 2002 Authorization for Use of Military Force (AUMF), and a new requirement for military personnel to display the name of the military service they are affiliated with when supporting civilian law enforcement activities in our communities.

""Despite these important provisions, this legislation exacerbates an already over-bloated Pentagon budget and funds several defense policies which will not make people any safer. This is why I could not support its final passage.""
