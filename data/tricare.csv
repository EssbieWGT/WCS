The NCDA welcomed the news, which will see the addition of more than 480 public and fleet chargers across the province to improve access for EV drivers. But the association also cautioned that charging infrastructure alone will not deliver the federal government and B.C.’s ambitious zero-emission vehicle targets “without action on affordability and policy timelines.”

“This investment is good news, but it won’t matter if British Columbians can’t afford the vehicles,” said Blair Qualey, President and CEO of the NCDA, in a statement. “The federal and provincial governments must re-establish EV rebate programs and put the brakes on unrealistic ZEV mandates. Without immediate action, these targets will remain out of reach — and consumers will be left behind.”

The NCDA said rebates are necessary. The ones under the CleanBC Go Electric program are currently on pause and pending review. And at the federal level, iZEV support is also under review. The association said the programs have been critical to making EVs more affordable for consumers and helping with uptake.

They also cautioned that mandates need a reality check, as the federal government’s national mandate/targets are not achievable due to the incentive situation, market readiness, and conditions that no longer exist. Rather, the association is advocating for a three-pillar approach to EV adoption: affordability through incentives, infrastructure, and education to build consumer confidence.

“All three must work together,” said Qualey. “Government cannot remove one leg of the stool and expect the system to stay upright. We are urging both levels of government to restore incentives and revisit ZEV policies before British Columbians are priced out of the market.”",https://tricorauto.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/cropped-tricor-favicon-O-32x32.png,N,0.0,2025-08-30 15:56:10.214634

“We need to give National Guardsmen consistent health care because we require them to be always ready,” said Julian Plamann, deputy director of legislative affairs for the National Guard Association for the United States (NGAUS), who also serves in the Maryland Army National Guard.
Many Guard families have said they’re hesitant to raise their hands and ask for help, fearing they will be seen as taking resources away from active-duty families.
“There is beauty with being National Guard,” said Courtney Deady, Ohio National Guard spouse and military family advocate.
So if it wasn't for the National Guard, we would still be cleaning up after this.” As the National Guard is increasingly called upon to serve, I’ve wondered, why are our conversations limited to what they are being asked to do rather than what we can do for them?","Jennifer Barnhill is a columnist for Military.com writing about military families.

Despite making headlines for helping after the catastrophic flooding in Texas or being politicized as President Donald Trump deploys it to police U.S. cities, the National Guard remains a mystery to both civilians and the active-duty force. However, as our nation increasingly calls upon the Guard, we need to better understand our “always ready” force, or it may not be ready when we need it.

“I was going to pick up a prescription that I needed, and they were like, ‘Your insurance isn't working’. And I was like, ‘What do you mean it's not working? It's Tricare,” said Emily Schmidt, whose spouse flies Black Hawk helicopters for the Maryland National Guard. They started by calling Tricare, who directed them to the personnel database, the Defense Enrollment Eligibility Reporting System, or DEERS, where staff told them they couldn’t help because his unit hadn't processed his orders properly.

Schmidt’s family was dropped from Tricare insurance because his new orders hadn’t been added to the system correctly, a particularly onerous issue for Guardsmen because their status and orders change regularly, causing them to have to pay out of pocket for medications during these transitions.

Despite representing 21% of the Defense Department’s total military force and more than 34% of the Army as of 2023, the challenges faced by those in the Guard are less visible, and often complicated. Unlike active-duty troops, who receive all their orders from the federal government, National Guard orders typically come directly from the governor of the state where they are assigned. Guardsmen get to “homestead,” but if they live far from their assigned state, they may find themselves away from available resources. They also have to balance the demands of working for a civilian employer, the state and the federal government when called upon to serve under federal orders.

There are three main types of National Guard duty statuses:

Title 10 – Federal control and funding, used for overseas deployments, combat operations, or other federal missions; eligible for full federal benefits and subject to the Uniform Code of Military Justice.

Title 32 – State control but federally funded; covers drills, annual training, homeland defense missions, and full-time Guard roles; federal benefits apply.

State Active Duty – State control and funding; used for state missions like disaster relief; state benefits only, not subject to the Posse Comitatus Act.

The complex set of statuses gets further complicated by the irregular nature of Guard funding.

“They'll say, ‘We're going to hire you for a year, but your orders are not cut for the year because of the way money is dispersed,” said Lainey Crown, National Guard spouse and mental health clinician/licensed professional clinical counselor. “Every time you get put on these new orders, somebody has to go in and push a button to say that you're eligible for Tricare. But that does not always happen.”

The Crown family had a six-day lapse in coverage, during which time one of their kids needed to have surgery. A few months later, they received a $20,000 bill. While the error was eventually corrected, it was not easy to identify who was the right person to fix the problem.

“There have been times if Patrick were to be in a car accident and killed today, and I would have to notify his unit, I don't know who to call,” said Crown, referring to her husband.

Because families can live anywhere, Crown has lived in North Carolina, Georgia and now Kentucky, while her spouse worked for the Maryland and now Alabama Army National Guard units. As a result, Crown has found herself far from available resources and, because they didn’t live near their unit, she did not know who to call for help when paperwork was not processed properly.

“The problem with it stopping and starting again is usually – and I'd say at least half the time – there's an error,” said Hope Daupert, who was named the 2025 AFI National Guard Spouse of the Year for her work educating Guardsmen about accessing life insurance, another area where lapses can occur due to changing statuses. “I think at this point, everybody's just so used to it. Nobody really complains about it anymore.”

Those potential lapses may have an impact on military readiness, according to advocates.

“We need to give National Guardsmen consistent health care because we require them to be always ready,” said Julian Plamann, deputy director of legislative affairs for the National Guard Association for the United States (NGAUS), who also serves in the Maryland Army National Guard. “The more that we use the National Guard, the more we're going to have to think about these benefits.”

NGAUS is one of the organizations that has aggressively advocated for military families. It has supported the Healthcare for Our Troops Act, a bipartisan piece of legislation that would give Guardsmen and reservists “premium-free/zero cost sharing medical coverage for Selected Reserve members eligible for Tricare Reserve Select (TRS).” The legislation would also allow Guardsmen to purchase care for family members, reducing gaps in coverage.

“When service members sign up to serve their country, it’s our duty to support them. That includes providing access to comprehensive health care,” said one of the bill’s co-sponsors, Sen. Tammy Baldwin, D-Wis., in an email to Military.com. “Extending Tricare to all service members not only does right by our troops and their families, it also is a common-sense investment in our military readiness.”

The legislation would do more than minimize gaps in coverage: It seeks to improve readiness.

According to NGAUS, an estimated 130,000 Guardsmen and reservists are currently without health care.

“A lot of times, they wait to go on orders so that they can fix any health issues free of charge,” said Plamann. When deployment notices are as short as 24 hours, these Guardsmen aren’t physically prepared to deploy. “Our medical readiness numbers for our units are very low.”

Plamann said that some version of this legislation has been proposed annually for the past 10 years, but has not seen progress in Congress. Plamann believes there is hesitation due to the costs involved. “To give National Guard and reserve health care coverage annually would cost about $700 million,” she said. This would amount to roughly .07 percent of the proposed $925 billion military budget. ""For how much the nation relies upon the Guard, that's worth it.”

But cost may not be the only obstacle. Many Guard families have said they’re hesitant to raise their hands and ask for help, fearing they will be seen as taking resources away from active-duty families.

At the same time, Guardsmen and their families are more and more in the political crosshairs.

The National Guard has been increasingly called upon by Trump, sometimes in more common natural disaster response roles, as in their activation after the recent floods in Texas, but also for what are seen as politically motivated reasons, like being mobilized to Los Angeles following protests against U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement or the more recent mobilization to Washington, D.C.

“People are so emotional about it that they don't see the person or the families behind it,” said Schmidt. “The service member might not agree with the things that are happening, but they still have a duty. … They still have a responsibility [to follow orders].”

If they are in the crosshairs nationally, Guardsmen are seen differently locally.

“There is beauty with being National Guard,” said Courtney Deady, Ohio National Guard spouse and military family advocate. “We're able to have our homes in the places that we've grown up. … I live a block away from my parents.” This sense of community isn’t just felt by the families; Guardsmen experience it too.

Deady recalls when her husband’s Guard unit came to the aid of their local community after tornadoes demolished buildings and homes in their Ohio town. “Within two hours of confirmation, our guys were on site, with our heavy equipment, with everything. So if it wasn't for the National Guard, we would still be cleaning up after this.”

As the National Guard is increasingly called upon to serve, I’ve wondered, why are our conversations limited to what they are being asked to do rather than what we can do for them?

Instead of accepting system failure as the status quo and blaming Guardsmen for the actions of politicians, we should be asking how we can improve National Guard quality of life, just as we did for active-duty families. We are all part of the military.",https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/UGuj_r8U6.9V0VE6Bjm1EQ--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyMDA7aD04MDA7Y2Y9d2VicA--/https://media.zenfs.com/en/military_com_347/f225906febc7379fd0c149e005e17773,N,0.0,2025-08-30 03:56:08.400216

“By accepting TRICARE, we want our local service members and their families to know that their health and well-being matter here.
If a service is not offered at KCCHC or transportation is a challenge, Knox County Mobility Management (KCMM) can help.","MOUNT VERNON — Knox County Community Health Center (KCCHC), a department of Knox Public Health, is reminding the community that it accepts TRICARE, the health insurance program for active-duty service members, reservists, retirees, and their families.

KCCHC provides accessible, affordable care close to home and wants military families to know that essential services are available through TRICARE.

“Serving our military families is a privilege,” said Shauna Schacht, Chief Executive Officer of Knox County Community Health Center. “By accepting TRICARE, we want our local service members and their families to know that their health and well-being matter here.

“Our team is committed to providing care that supports them right in their own community.”

Military families often face unique challenges such as deployments, relocations, and added stress.

By accepting TRICARE, KCCHC helps reduce barriers to care and ensures that service members and their loved ones can access essential services without traveling outside the community.

TRICARE provides comprehensive coverage worldwide, including health plans, special programs, prescriptions, and dental care. Most plans meet minimum essential coverage under the Affordable Care Act.

At KCCHC, TRICARE covers primary care, mental health and PTSD support, substance use counseling and Narcan distribution, and vaccinations including flu, COVID 19, and shingles.

If a service is not offered at KCCHC or transportation is a challenge, Knox County Mobility Management (KCMM) can help. KCMM works to reduce barriers to care by connecting residents including veterans, older adults, individuals with disabilities, and lower income residents to the most appropriate transportation resources.

Options include public transit, private operators, volunteer drivers, cycling, and walking. KCMM does not provide rides directly but helps identify the best option for everyone.

Appointments at KCCHC can be scheduled by calling 740-399-8008. For transportation assistance through KCMM, call 740-392-2200 ext.2218.

This is the agency’s fourth Joint Meritorious Unit Award in its nearly 12-year history.","Beginning with the Continental Congress authorizing the establishment of a hospital for its army of 20,000 soldiers in 1775, the United States has provided health care to its active military members for hundreds of years.

Among the developments before the 20th Century:

July 1776 - Continental Army Medical Department is established

Aug. 1842 - Navy Bureau of Medicine and Surgery is established

May 1862 - Army Medical Museum is established to serve as a center for the collection of specimens for research in military medicine and surgery.

In 1951, DOD strengthened the Office of Medical Services and renamed it the Armed Forces Medical Policy Council. The new agency provided coordination of medical policy within the Office of the Secretary of Defense, DOD, other government agencies, and civilian medical and allied health organizations, agencies, and professions.

The Wound Data and Munitions Effectiveness Team was established during the Vietnam War. The team included medical and weapons experts who collected data on wounds and injuries sustained by service members during the war. The team's findings were used to improve the design and effectiveness of military weapons and protective gear.

Congress passed the Military Medical Benefits Amendments. Collectively, these acts founded the Civilian Health and Medical Program of the Uniformed Services, known as CHAMPUS. CHAMPUS established a way for DOD to contract with civilian facilities so beneficiaries could receive non-hospital-based services through civilian health care plans.

The Composite Health Care System was the DOD's first health record system to go paperless with electronic order entry. CHCS is also the basis of the Armed Forces Health Longitudinal Technology Application, which focused on delivering a military treatment facility-centric electronic health record that supported computerized physician order entry and integrated outpatient ancillary services.

Many people first heard about telehealth during the COVID-19 pandemic, but did you know telehealth has been around for more than 30 years? In the 1990s, the medical field was exploring how telehealth and telemedicine could enhance medical operational support. This was most notable in 1993, when the U.S. Army first used video-enabled care in Somalia. This care quickly expanded in 1994 and 1995 during operations in the Balkans.

The Defense Department and Department of Veterans Affairs successfully collaborated to form the Defense and Veterans Head Injury Program which was later named the Defense and Veterans Brain Injury Center. The program tracked service members' head and neck injuries, ensured they received the right treatment, studied the treatment outcome, and counseled family members regarding the service members' injuries.

The Gulf War Health Center at Walter Reed Army Medical Center was established to care for Gulf War veterans with war-related physical and mental health challenges. In 1999, it became the Deployment Health Clinical Center—one of three DOD centers of excellence for deployment health—along with the Armed Forces Health Surveillance Center and the Naval Health Research Center.

Founded on Oct. 31, 1997, the Air Force Research Laboratory leads the discovery, development, and delivery of warfighting technologies for our air, space, and cyber forces. One of the centers is the U.S. Air Force School of Aerospace Medicine, an internationally renowned center for aerospace medical learning, consultation, aerospace medical investigations, and aircrew health assessments. The U.S. Air Force Research Laboratory trains approximately 6,000 students each year.

The end of the Gulf War resulted in the recognition that an electronic health record was needed. President Bill Clinton directed establishment of a new Force Health Protection program. Under his plan, every soldier, sailor, airman, and Marine would have a comprehensive, lifelong medical record.

Defense Secretary William Cohen started reforms to separate elements of the DOD Health Affairs agency's operations and from policy making. Health Affairs policy makers remained housed in the Pentagon, while TRICARE operations and support relocated to Washington, D.C., and Aurora, Colorado. The TRICARE Support Office's priorities included force medical protection, Medicare subvention, which provided alternatives for delivering accessible and quality care to certain veterans, and preventive medicine and wellness issues.

DHAPP was established in 2001 to help contain the global health threat posed by the HIV pandemic. DHAPP’s mission was, and still is, to assist foreign militaries in developing HIV control programs in support of global health security and DOD security cooperation efforts.

In 2004, the military medical departments were directed to establish a single trauma registry in order to collect and aggregate combat casualty care epidemiology, treatments, and outcomes. This knowledge was essential to understanding the challenges, successes, and failures the military medical corps faced in providing effective and timely care for combat casualties. The Joint Trauma System was established as the agency to build and manage the Joint Trauma Registry.

On March 11, 2013, the Deputy Secretary of Defense issued a memorandum outlining the implementation of MHS governance reform as it was outlined in section 731 of the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2013. While the centerpiece for this reform was the establishment of the DHA as a Combat Support Agency, the memo also established multi-service market areas as geographic areas where at least two military medical hospitals or clinics from different military service branches had overlapping service areas.

On Oct. 1, 2013, DOD established the DHA as a one of eight Combat Support Agencies supporting joint operating forces and Combatant Commands engaged in military operations and to direct the execution of 10 joint shared services: the TRICARE health program; pharmacy operations; health information technology; medical logistics; facility management; research and development; education and training; public health; budget and resource management; and contracting. The TRICARE Management Activity was decommissioned with the establishment of the DHA.

On July 9, 2014, DHA assumed operational management and support of the ASBP and DHAPP. Each program brought a unique combat support capability to the DHA. The ASBP is the official provider of blood products for the U.S. Armed Forces. The DHAPP executes worldwide HIV/AIDS prevention, care, and treatment programs.

On Aug. 23, 2015, the National Museum of Health and Medicine joined DHA. The museum spans five collections consisting of about 25 million artifacts, including the bullet that killed President Abraham Lincoln, 5,000 skeletal specimens, 8,000 preserved organs, 12,000 items of medical equipment, an archive of historic medical documents, and more.

The Armed Forces Medical Examiner System has a history dating back to the 1950s and early 1960s, which evolved by the expansion of the Armed Forces Institute of Pathology's field of study that included a forensic pathology registry in 1958. In 1959, the Military Environmental Pathology Division was established, consisting of forensic pathology, aviation medicine, and toxicology. In 1962, the first forensic pathology fellowship in the United States was established. AFMES was formally transferred from MRMC to the DHA on Aug. 31, 2015.

The Defense Department awarded the contract to build the Department's electronic health record, later branded as MHS GENESIS. The deployment of MHS GENESIS began in the Pacific Northwest in 2015 followed by 25 unique waves encompassing military hospitals and clinics in the U.S.. In September 2023, MHS GENESIS began to deploy to military hospitals and clinics in the European and Indo-Pacific regions.

In fall of 2016, the Office of the Under Secretary of Defense for Personnel and Readiness recommended the DOD ""establish the JTS, in its role as the DOD Trauma System as the lead agency for trauma in DOD with authority to establish and assure best-practice trauma care guidelines to the DHA Director, the Services, and the Combatant Commanders.

On Dec. 11, 2016, the Hearing Center of Excellence became a part of DHA. The Center focuses on the prevention, diagnosis, mitigation, treatment, and rehabilitation of hearing loss and auditory injury. It also partners with the VA, institutions of higher education, and other mission-minded public and private organizations to advance research and care in hearing loss.

In 2016, the Defense Centers of Excellence for Psychological Health and Traumatic Brain Injury and its centers transitioned to DHA. The Deployment Health Clinical Center officially changed its name to the Psychological Health Center of Excellence to better align with its current mission. The Defense and Veterans Brain Injury Center retained its enduring mission of evaluating, integrating, and promoting TBI practices and policies across the services.

Section 702 of the Fiscal Year 2017 National Defense Authorization Act and subsequent guidance provided by Congress in 2018, 2019, and 2020 directed the Military Health System to reorganize, redefining the roles of the military departments and DHA in the administration and management of military hospitals and clinics.

In March 2018, the Vision Center of Excellence joined the DHA family to address the full scope of vision care in the armed forces, including prevention, diagnosis, mitigation, treatment, research, and rehabilitation of military eye injuries and diseases in order to improve vision health, optimize readiness, and enhance quality of life for service members and veterans.

On Jan. 30, 2020, medical facilities were organized into four regions within the United States. These “markets” included hospitals and clinics in the National Capital Region (Washington, D.C., southern Maryland, and northern Virginia), along with Jacksonville, Florida, the Mississippi coast (Biloxi, Gulfport, and Pascagoula), and Central North Carolina (Fayetteville). Following a brief pause during the COVID-19 pandemic, Tidewater became the 5th market to be established on April 19, 2021.

In October 2022, the Army, Navy/Marine Corps, and Air Force moved public health centers and programs to the DHA. The newly established DHA Public Health enterprise supports the Joint Force and the DOD across the globe by combining and integrating the efforts of the service components to enable a healthy ready force that includes our military families and other beneficiaries.

In March 2024, an initiative called “My Military Health” was launched at five venture sites around the nation. The tools were designed offer care that was individualized, accessible, and convenient. My Military Health will be accessible 24/7 by computer and mobile devices, will allow patients to schedule appointments, engage with automated clinical support for medical conditions, and use self-help wellness programs.

The Dec. 2024 launch of www.dha.mil provided the Agency with a standalone platform to share developments and news with stakeholders, provide information for vendors to more easily do business with the Agency, give beneficiaries easily navigable pathways to their own care, and establish an employee hub to highlight the benefits and opportunities available in working for the DHA.

The Defense Health Agency distinguished itself by exceptionally meritorious achievement from Nov. 1, 2020, to June 30, 2021. During this period, the president of the United States and secretary of defense appointed the DHA to develop and execute a vaccination plan to protect 11.3 million eligible personnel worldwide. The first DOD Coronavirus-2019 Vaccine Distribution Plan addressed acquisition, distribution, resourcing, training, administration, reporting, and communications. This is the agency’s fourth Joint Meritorious Unit Award in its nearly 12-year history.",https://dha.mil/-/media/Project/Images/History-Timeline/1775-US-Army-Medical-ServiceCorps.jpg,N,0.0,2025-08-30 09:56:11.268665

Prosecutors say Adelle Starin operated the store, selling baby products and toys. The 41-year-old Sartell woman submitted false claims for reimbursement to the U.S. Department of Defense’s healthcare program, TRICARE, which initially paid out the claims. When TRICARE began rejecting her claims, Starin created a fictitious company called Sunshine Medical LLC. She falsely represented to two lenders, Liquid Capital Enterprises Corp. and Slope Tech Inc., saying she needed financing to buy supplies for her store from a place called Sunshine Medical, which was a shell company. To collect the cash, Starin created fake invoices from Sunshine Medical and sent them via interstate wire transfers.

In December, Starin pleaded guilty in U.S. District Court to one count of wire fraud. In addition to the prison sentence, she must also serve three years of supervised release and pay $2.35 million in restitution.

Hello and welcome to Health Affairs This Week. I'm your host, Jeff Beyers. We're recording on 08/25/2025. Just as a reminder, we are releasing a new theme issue next week on the opioid crisis. On September 3, we have a free issue briefing on the issue.

Jeff Byers: 01:04

On September 17, we have a lunch and learn on the current opioids policy landscape and what's ahead. Hope you'll join us for that and check out the issue. Today on the pod to talk about, pharmacy benefit managers and, laws around it, we have Andrew Twinemasyko, from the O'Neill Institute for National and Global Health Law. Andrew, welcome back to the program.

Andrew Twinamatsiko: 01:25

Oh, thank you, Jeff. It's always a pleasure talking to you.

Jeff Byers: 01:29

So there've been a lot of PBM cases going on lately. What case are we discussing today and how might it differ from the others?

Andrew Twinamatsiko: 01:35

Well, so today we are here to talk about the riveting case of Express Scripts versus Richmond, a case challenging Arkansas's recently enacted law prohibiting PBMs from owning operating pharmacies in Arkansas. As of today, the case has actually now gone to the Eighth Circuit Court of Appeals because the Arkansas District Court ruled against Arkansas and enjoined the law. And the statute in question in this case is the first to take this step that prohibits PBMs from owning operating pharmacies within a state.

Jeff Byers: 02:11

So what is the Arkansas PBM law? What does it actually do? Why was this law made in the first place?

Andrew Twinamatsiko: 02:19

Okay. So let's contextualize it like, so we all know that the price of prescription drugs in The United States is way higher than that in other peer economies. Drug prices in The United States triple the prices of comparable countries with US consumers paying almost $3 for every dollar spent by consumers in other countries. And of course The US drug market has very many stakeholders. We have manufacturers, distributors, insurers, pharmacies, PBMs and many others.

Andrew Twinamatsiko: 02:50

And each of these players have a role in driving up the price of prescription drugs. There's been a lot of talk over the last few years about the unique role that pharmacy benefit managers have played in driving up the skyrocketing prices of prescription drugs. And I don't want to sound like it's solely PBMs responsible for this. What I'm saying is that they are part of this system. And today there are three PBMs, namely CVS's Caremark, Cigna's Express Scripts and UnitedHealth's Optum, which by the way the FTC has referred to as the big three.

Andrew Twinamatsiko: 03:28

Maybe soon one of these big three will come out like Kendrick Lamar and say like, oh no, it's not the big three, it's big me. I don't know, but I digress. Anyway, the big three control 80% of the market. And more importantly here is that PBMs are part of vertically integrated organizations. They have relationships with insurers, with providers, with pharmacies, and actually have stakes in those establishments, which contributes to the opaqueness of the operations and how those relationships contribute to driving up prices.

Andrew Twinamatsiko: 04:05

So for example, CVS owns CVS pharmacies, Caremark, a PBM and Aetna, an insurer. And so this is included in reports by FTC, The US House Committee On Oversight And Government and how they engage in anti competitive behaviors. So anyway, to address the anti competitive behaviors that the PBMs engage in, there've been a wide range of laws that are passed. But the Arkansas law that was passed this week takes a new approach. It prohibits PBMs from operating pharmacies and Arkansas is not actually not an outlier.

Andrew Twinamatsiko: 04:42

There are other statutes of the sort that have been introduced in New York and in Texas and in Vermont. And so Arkansas takes that approach of trying to rein in their vertical integration of PBMs.

Jeff Byers: 04:56

Why are we hearing more about the Arkansas law then versus, you know, the New York or the?

Andrew Twinamatsiko: 05:02

Oh, the the New York, they have just been introduced, but Arkansas, they're still they haven't been passed, enacted so to speak. Okay. Arkansas just it was is the one that was the first one to pass this law and enact it. Other ones have just been introduced.

Jeff Byers: 05:16

So what is the current status of Express Scripts versus Richmond?

Andrew Twinamatsiko: 05:20

So there were actually four lawsuits that were filed, Express Scripts, CVS Pharmacy, Optum and the trade group that represents PBMs, PCMA, and they're all consolidated in one case. And they brought a wide range of challenges, mainly saying that the law violates the so called dormant commerce clause. And it's also preempted by several federal laws. It violates the equal protection clause, it violates the bill of attainder. And so like a wide range of cause of action and the court sided with the challenges on two grounds.

Andrew Twinamatsiko: 05:58

One, found that the law likely violates the Dohman Commerce Clause and is likely preempted by TRICARE, and thereby, the court issued its order enjoining the the stat the the law on those two grounds.

Jeff Byers: 06:11

Okay. So I'm not a lawyer. Chris Fleming's not on the call. What what does that mean? Like, when are you talking about the grounds and TRICARE and the dormant commerce clause?

Andrew Twinamatsiko: 06:23

Yeah. And this actually might seem like arcane principles, but so let me break them down bit by bit. I'll start with the commerce clause. So the US constitution grants Congress the power to regulate commerce among the several states. In other words, it's only Congress that may regulate interstate commerce.

Andrew Twinamatsiko: 06:43

And the Supreme Court has interpreted this affirmative grant of authority to Congress as also implicitly having a negative aspect. In other words, Congress has power that lies dormant even when it's not exercised and that power prohibits States from undertaking certain actions that might interfere with the national economy. So when you hear constitution lawyers talking about the so called dormant commerce clause, that's the part they're referring to. And so this, the dormant commerce clause is actually mainly aimed at guarding against economic protectionist laws. So when states engage in discriminatory behavior favoring in state business and disfavoring out of state businesses, that type of discrimination is impermissible under the dormant commerce clause.

Andrew Twinamatsiko: 07:27

And there is another way through which states can violate the so called dormant commerce clause by imposing what is called an undue burden on interstate commerce. So if a state enacts a law that really it's kind of a balance what courts look at, they could have a balance like if the burdens that the state imposes on interstate commerce far outweigh the local benefits, then that law has to be validated. And so the court here said that the Arkansas law one, actually expressly and overtly discriminates against interstate commerce because it was passed with a protectionist intent to protect local pharmacies and local independent pharmacies. Then the court straight up said, you say this in the statute that you enacted this statute to protect local businesses and harm out of state businesses. So the court found that was impermissible.

Jeff Byers: 08:27

So is what you're saying the potential for the Arkansas PBM law kind of enacts that dormant commerce clause to like wake up essentially?

Andrew Twinamatsiko: 08:36

Yeah. So the Arkansas PBM law violates the dormant commerce clause. The PBMs said that by enacting this law, you are intruding in a space that involves Congress's power and you are discriminating against interstate commerce favoring in state businesses. So yes, that triggers the dohment commerce clause and thereby invalidate it.

Jeff Byers: 09:04

So that's the big three's argument against the state law. Okay. So that's ground number one.

Andrew Twinamatsiko: 09:11

Yeah. So the interesting thing is that the court found so a state law can violate the Dormant Commerce Clause in two ways. One, by discriminating and two, by unduly burdening interstate commerce. So the court found on both fronts, the Arkansas law likely violates the Dormant Commerce Clause. So the court said, even if you didn't discriminate against interstate commerce, there is another way you could have gone about achieving the goals of this legislation without necessarily prohibiting PBMs from owning and operating pharmacies in Arkansas.

Andrew Twinamatsiko: 09:45

You could have, you already have actually, cannabis has three laws that already prohibit these conflicts of interests in a way. And the court said, you are really putting a huge burden on a national market to achieve specific state benefits that you have already achieved otherwise.

Jeff Byers: 10:03

So they're just saying, like, come on, buddy?

Andrew Twinamatsiko: 10:06

Well, yeah. I mean, yeah. Like, basically, I think the idea is that you have to show that there are huge benefits that this law brings that outweigh the burdens that you're putting on your own national operators.

Jeff Byers: 10:19

So that's commerce clause, anything we wanna talk touch on with TRICARE, Prun?

Andrew Twinamatsiko: 10:23

Yeah. So this, and I think, actually talking about the Commerce Clause and TRICARE preemption, they really all involve the same concerns about the power of the federal government. So there is this pesky thing called the supremacy clause and I'm being facetious there. But basically it's how the hierarchy of laws between federal and state laws. The supremacy clause dictates that federal law takes precedence over state law.

Andrew Twinamatsiko: 10:55

When the two conflict, state law has to give way. And there are different ways through which a state law can be preempted. Congress can come and straight up say like, Hey, states, you can't do this. Hammer time, you can't touch this.

Jeff Byers: 11:08

So,

Andrew Twinamatsiko: 11:12

the court said, and also, so one is express, you can expressly preempt a state law or impliedly preempted. If the court finds that, for example, a state law stands as an obstacle in accomplishing federal objectives, then the state law has to give way in that context. So here, there is language in the TRICARE program, which is the program that provides through which the military gets its healthcare that says it preempts state laws that concern the delivery of healthcare. And because Tricare contracts with PBMs in delivering healthcare, the court found that this law expressly preempts that aspect.

Jeff Byers: 11:54

So this is a preliminary injunction, if I'm understanding it, what might this mean for the future of the case?

Andrew Twinamatsiko: 12:02

Well, so preliminary injunction means that the law Akela can't enforce the law for now. But before the court, and issuing a preliminary injunction is actually a big deal. A court just it's considered an extraordinary remedy, so you really have to convince the court on different fronts. One is that you are likely to win when the case is fully litigated and not only are you likely to win but also there isn't any other remedy available through which you can be compensated should you win. So like to really stop a duly enacted law of the state, the court has to weigh a lot of things.

Andrew Twinamatsiko: 12:41

So what this means is that because the court has already projected that Arkansas is likely to win on these two fronts, this slot will likely not be enforced for the near future until the case goes all the way through the litigation process.

Jeff Byers: 12:56

Okay. So but they are kind of signaling that there is good chance that the law could eventually get on the books.

Andrew Twinamatsiko: 13:07

What the court is saying is that Arkansas is likely to lose when it all it's all said and done, at least likely to lose on those two grounds, Dohman Thomas Clause and TRICARE preemption.

Jeff Byers: 13:17

So what does this mean for other states looking into this particular idea? What does it mean for the pharmaceutical industry in general?

Andrew Twinamatsiko: 13:27

Well, I mean, least for other states, and I think, well, one thing is that Arkansas district court is a district court. It has jurisdiction within only Arkansas, and other courts aren't bound by that decision. So meaning, let's say Texas or Vermont or New York passed that law, those states can take their chances if those laws are challenged, states can take their chances before those courts. And it remains to be seen if they'll be persuaded by the reasoning that the judge in the Arkansas case did. But also one thing to notice is that there are specifics in this case.

Andrew Twinamatsiko: 14:10

For example, the judge in the Arkansas case looked at the legislative history of this case, of this statute, and how the statute was designed. And so those specifics in various aspects tanked this case before this judge. Other states might take a different approach that might not necessarily be similar in those specifics with other in their legislation. So states can go ahead and do that. Of course, like as I said, until the Supreme Court says that this is how it is, we're going to have different legislation go through the states and see what really the status of the law is.

Jeff Byers: 14:59

Final question is, are there particular healthcare law cases that you're keeping track of that you just would like the listeners to know about or that you find interesting?

Andrew Twinamatsiko: 15:07

Yeah, I mentioned litigation over the Medicare drug negotiation program and sphing of states taking action. There are different states enacting laws curbing prescription drug prices. One particular litigation that we're watching is litigation over Colorado's Prescription Drug Affordability Board. Amgen sued Colorado claiming different, that it violates different constitutional guarantees and so that litigation is also going on. So we're keeping an eye on different litigation both at the federal and state levels challenging what this government can do to keep the price of prescription drugs down.

,,2025-08-29 15:53:47+00:00,Military.com,Why No One Understands National Guard Families | Military.com,"Jennifer Barnhill, Jennifer Barnhill Published",,,,,https://www.military.com/daily-news/2025/08/29/why-no-one-understands-national-guard-families.html,"It's Tricare,” said Emily Schmidt, whose spouse flies Black Hawk helicopters for the Maryland National Guard.
“We need to give National Guardsmen consistent health care because we require them to be always ready,” said Julian Plamann, deputy director of legislative affairs for the National Guard Association for the United States (NGAUS), who also serves in the Maryland Army National Guard.
Many Guard families have said they’re hesitant to raise their hands and ask for help, fearing they will be seen as taking resources away from active-duty families.
“There is beauty with being National Guard,” said Courtney Deady, Ohio National Guard spouse and military family advocate.
So if it wasn't for the National Guard, we would still be cleaning up after this.” As the National Guard is increasingly called upon to serve, I’ve wondered, why are our conversations limited to what they are being asked to do rather than what we can do for them?","Jennifer Barnhill is a columnist for Military.com writing about military families.

Despite making headlines for helping after the catastrophic flooding in Texas or being politicized as President Donald Trump deploys it to police U.S. cities, the National Guard remains a mystery to both civilians and the active-duty force. However, as our nation increasingly calls upon the Guard, we need to better understand our “always ready” force, or it may not be ready when we need it.

“I was going to pick up a prescription that I needed, and they were like, ‘Your insurance isn't working’. And I was like, ‘What do you mean it's not working? It's Tricare,” said Emily Schmidt, whose spouse flies Black Hawk helicopters for the Maryland National Guard. They started by calling Tricare, who directed them to the personnel database, the Defense Enrollment Eligibility Reporting System, or DEERS, where staff told them they couldn’t help because his unit hadn't processed his orders properly.

Schmidt’s family was dropped from Tricare insurance because his new orders hadn’t been added to the system correctly, a particularly onerous issue for Guardsmen because their status and orders change regularly, causing them to have to pay out of pocket for medications during these transitions.

Despite representing 21% of the Defense Department’s total military force and more than 34% of the Army as of 2023, the challenges faced by those in the Guard are less visible, and often complicated. Unlike active-duty troops, who receive all their orders from the federal government, National Guard orders typically come directly from the governor of the state where they are assigned. Guardsmen get to “homestead,” but if they live far from their assigned state, they may find themselves away from available resources. They also have to balance the demands of working for a civilian employer, the state and the federal government when called upon to serve under federal orders.

There are three main types of National Guard duty statuses:

Title 10 – Federal control and funding, used for overseas deployments, combat operations, or other federal missions; eligible for full federal benefits and subject to the Uniform Code of Military Justice.

Title 32 – State control but federally funded; covers drills, annual training, homeland defense missions, and full-time Guard roles; federal benefits apply.

State Active Duty – State control and funding; used for state missions like disaster relief; state benefits only, not subject to the Posse Comitatus Act.

The complex set of statuses gets further complicated by the irregular nature of Guard funding.

“They'll say, ‘We're going to hire you for a year, but your orders are not cut for the year because of the way money is dispersed,” said Lainey Crown, National Guard spouse and mental health clinician/licensed professional clinical counselor. “Every time you get put on these new orders, somebody has to go in and push a button to say that you're eligible for Tricare. But that does not always happen.”

The Crown family had a six-day lapse in coverage, during which time one of their kids needed to have surgery. A few months later, they received a $20,000 bill. While the error was eventually corrected, it was not easy to identify who was the right person to fix the problem.

“There have been times if Patrick were to be in a car accident and killed today, and I would have to notify his unit, I don't know who to call,” said Crown, referring to her husband.

Because families can live anywhere, Crown has lived in North Carolina, Georgia and now Kentucky, while her spouse worked for the Maryland and now Alabama Army National Guard units. As a result, Crown has found herself far from available resources and, because they didn’t live near their unit, she did not know who to call for help when paperwork was not processed properly.

“The problem with it stopping and starting again is usually – and I'd say at least half the time – there's an error,” said Hope Daupert, who was named the 2025 AFI National Guard Spouse of the Year for her work educating Guardsmen about accessing life insurance, another area where lapses can occur due to changing statuses. “I think at this point, everybody's just so used to it. Nobody really complains about it anymore.”

Those potential lapses may have an impact on military readiness, according to advocates.

“We need to give National Guardsmen consistent health care because we require them to be always ready,” said Julian Plamann, deputy director of legislative affairs for the National Guard Association for the United States (NGAUS), who also serves in the Maryland Army National Guard. “The more that we use the National Guard, the more we're going to have to think about these benefits.”

NGAUS is one of the organizations that has aggressively advocated for military families. It has supported the Healthcare for Our Troops Act, a bipartisan piece of legislation that would give Guardsmen and reservists “premium-free/zero cost sharing medical coverage for Selected Reserve members eligible for Tricare Reserve Select (TRS).” The legislation would also allow Guardsmen to purchase care for family members, reducing gaps in coverage.

“When service members sign up to serve their country, it’s our duty to support them. That includes providing access to comprehensive health care,” said one of the bill’s co-sponsors, Sen. Tammy Baldwin, D-Wis., in an email to Military.com. “Extending Tricare to all service members not only does right by our troops and their families, it also is a common-sense investment in our military readiness.”

The legislation would do more than minimize gaps in coverage: It seeks to improve readiness.

According to NGAUS, an estimated 130,000 Guardsmen and reservists are currently without health care.

“A lot of times, they wait to go on orders so that they can fix any health issues free of charge,” said Plamann. When deployment notices are as short as 24 hours, these Guardsmen aren’t physically prepared to deploy. “Our medical readiness numbers for our units are very low.”

Plamann said that some version of this legislation has been proposed annually for the past 10 years, but has not seen progress in Congress. Plamann believes there is hesitation due to the costs involved. “To give National Guard and reserve health care coverage annually would cost about $700 million,” she said. This would amount to roughly .07 percent of the proposed $925 billion military budget. ""For how much the nation relies upon the Guard, that's worth it.”

But cost may not be the only obstacle. Many Guard families have said they’re hesitant to raise their hands and ask for help, fearing they will be seen as taking resources away from active-duty families.

At the same time, Guardsmen and their families are more and more in the political crosshairs.

The National Guard has been increasingly called upon by Trump, sometimes in more common natural disaster response roles, as in their activation after the recent floods in Texas, but also for what are seen as politically motivated reasons, like being mobilized to Los Angeles following protests against U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement or the more recent mobilization to Washington, D.C.

“People are so emotional about it that they don't see the person or the families behind it,” said Schmidt. “The service member might not agree with the things that are happening, but they still have a duty. … They still have a responsibility [to follow orders].”

If they are in the crosshairs nationally, Guardsmen are seen differently locally.

“There is beauty with being National Guard,” said Courtney Deady, Ohio National Guard spouse and military family advocate. “We're able to have our homes in the places that we've grown up. … I live a block away from my parents.” This sense of community isn’t just felt by the families; Guardsmen experience it too.

Deady recalls when her husband’s Guard unit came to the aid of their local community after tornadoes demolished buildings and homes in their Ohio town. “Within two hours of confirmation, our guys were on site, with our heavy equipment, with everything. So if it wasn't for the National Guard, we would still be cleaning up after this.”

As the National Guard is increasingly called upon to serve, I’ve wondered, why are our conversations limited to what they are being asked to do rather than what we can do for them?

Instead of accepting system failure as the status quo and blaming Guardsmen for the actions of politicians, we should be asking how we can improve National Guard quality of life, just as we did for active-duty families. We are all part of the military.

""For less than 1% of the Department of Defense health care budget, we can ensure a ready reserve component.
Many are conducted under state active duty, which provides no health care.
That would provide Guardsmen and Reservists medical coverage on par with their active-component counterparts, McGinn said.
""We would never debate the need to provide medical coverage for active-component troops,"" he said.","The following information was released by the National Guard Association of the United States (NGAUS):

Introduced by Sen. Tammy Baldwin, D-Wis., the Healthcare for Our Troops Act (S. 2575) would offer premium-free, zero-cost-share medical coverage to every member of the Guard and Reserve through TRICARE, the military's health insurance program.

About 130,000 Guardsmen and Reservists currently have no medical coverage. Hundreds of thousands more pay for their own coverage or rely on employer-provided health insurance.

Baldwin spoke at the 147th General Conference and Exhibition on Saturday in Milwaukee, where she received the NGAUS Harry S. Truman Award, the association's highest honor.

""We've fallen short in a pretty crucial area and that is basic health care,"" she told attendees. ""I believe that's morally wrong. It's bad for preparedness and readiness. And yes, we need to change it.""

""Readiness begins with wellness, and wellness begins with access,"" said retired Maj. Gen. Francis M. McGinn, the NGAUS president. ""For less than 1% of the Department of Defense health care budget, we can ensure a ready reserve component.

""Our Guardsmen need this, and our nation needs them,"" he added. ""I thank Senator Baldwin and her staff for their dedication to the National Guard and for their work on this effort.""

Current law provides coverage to part-time Guardsmen and Reservists only when they are federally mobilized on orders for more than 30 days. Most of the Guard's domestic missions are of a shorter duration. Many are conducted under state active duty, which provides no health care.

In addition, Guardsmen must also be medically ready to respond to the state or nation with little to no notice. This can be challenging for the almost one in five who have no private coverage and lack access to routine, preventive health care, McGinn added.

Zero-cost TRICARE is a top NGAUS legislative priority.

Both the House and Senate have considered legislation to expand medical coverage to part-time service members in recent years. Major legislation such as this often requires several years to win congressional approval.

S. 2575 would enroll Guardsmen and Reservists into TRICARE Reserve Select at no cost.

TRS is currently a partially subsidized program for drilling Guardsmen and Reservists. They cover a monthly premium and co-pays for services. The legislation would eliminate all those costs.

That would provide Guardsmen and Reservists medical coverage on par with their active-component counterparts, McGinn said.

""We would never debate the need to provide medical coverage for active-component troops,"" he said. ""We need to view Guard Soldiers and Airmen in the same light.""",https://insurancenewsnet.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/inn-social-default.jpg,N,0.0,2025-08-29 12:56:19.349779

You have the same coverage as TRICARE Prime.
Q: What is TRICARE Prime Remote Overseas?
A: If you serve overseas in a remote location, check out TRICARE Prime Remote Overseas.","FALLS CHURCH, VA, August 28, 2025 -If you live far from a military hospital or clinic, TRICARE Prime Remote could be the right TRICARE health plan for you. While TRICARE Prime is only available to eligible beneficiaries in Prime Service Areas (designated regions that have proximity to military hospitals or clinics), TPR extends coverage beyond PSAs. This plan helps active duty service members and their family members get care when they live or work in areas that are remote from military hospitals or clinics.

“TPR helps you get high-quality care, wherever you are,” said Shane Pham, management and program analyst, TRICARE Health Plan Policy & Programs Branch, at the Defense Health Agency. “TRICARE is committed to supporting you and your family, wherever you’re called to serve.”

Q: Who can enroll in TRICARE Prime Remote?

A: TPR is for service members who:

Are on active duty, OR

Are in the National Guard or Reserve on active duty for more than 30 days, AND

Live and work more than 50 miles (or one hour’s drive) from a military hospital or clinic

TPR is for active duty family members who live:

With a sponsor enrolled in TPR, OR

With a sponsor who gets care at a small military clinic that doesn’t have space to see family members, OR

In areas remote from a military hospital or clinic with National Guard or Reserve members called to active duty for 30 days or more

If your sponsor deploys, you can still enroll in TPR for up to 90 days after their deployment date.

Not sure if TPR is available? Check the Plan Finder tool or contact your regional contractor.

Q: Why choose TPR?

A: With TPR, you don’t pay enrollment fees. You have the same coverage as TRICARE Prime. You pay nothing for health care when you see your primary care manager or use a referral to see a network provider.

Q: How do I get care?

A: With TPR, you’ll have a PCM who takes care of most of your health needs. Your PCM might be:

A provider in the TRICARE network, if one is nearby

Any TRICARE-authorized provider, if no network PCMs are available

Your PCM will:

Refer you to specialists when needed

Work with TRICARE for approvals

Help find network specialists

File your claims

Q: What are my costs?

A: If you follow the rules for getting care with your TPR plan, you can lower your costs. There are no out-of-pocket costs for covered services. (Note: If you get care without a referral, you may have to pay point-of-service fees.)

You’ll have copayments for prescriptions filled through the TRICARE Pharmacy Program.

Q: How do I choose the right plan for me?

A: When picking a health plan:

Compare TPR with other TRICARE health plans.

Think about other health insurance you might have.

Consider how far you live from the nearest military hospital or clinic.

If you’re a qualifying ADFM, you may be eligible for reimbursement for travel costs under the Prime Travel Benefit.

Q: How do I enroll?

A: To enroll in TPR:

Check if TPR is available using the Plan Finder.

Call your regional contractor.

ADSMs must wait until they reach their duty station before enrolling in TPR.

Q: What is TRICARE Prime Remote Overseas?

A: If you serve overseas in a remote location, check out TRICARE Prime Remote Overseas. TPR Overseas is a managed care option in several overseas locations in Eurasia-Africa, Latin America and Canada, and the Pacific. It’s only available to ADSMs, their command-sponsored family members, and activated NGR members, as described in the TRICARE Plans Overview Fact Sheet.

Note that when you enroll in TPR Overseas, you have access to an overseas point of contact. TPR Overseas POCs can help with scheduling appointments, filing claims, and more. You can call your TRICARE Area Office to connect with an overseas POC.

TRICARE works to ensure all service members and their family members receive high-quality care, no matter where they serve.",https://myairforcebenefits.us.af.mil/Content/images/favicon.ico,N,0.0,2025-08-29 06:56:15.977883

Knowing the operations status of Andrews before, during and after a storm is crucial for safety and mission readiness. The base communicates updates in several ways, and all personnel, families and mission partners are encouraged to stay connected through official channels, such as the base website (www.jba.af.mil) and the JBA Connect App. People are also encouraged to subscribe to emergency alerts from the National Weather Service and the National Hurricane Center.

Hurricane Erin became the first major hurricane of the season when it formed Aug. 11, 2025, and while it didn’t make landfall, it did have minor impacts as it traveled north along the East Coast. The hurricane reached a peak of Category 5 on Aug. 16 before weakening to Category 1 on Aug. 22 as it went past the coast of North Carolina.

When hurricanes are forecast to impact the area, base personnel should monitor weather updates closely and be ready to act. This may include securing outdoor property, adjusting travel plans, or preparing for shelter-in-place orders. If ordered to evacuate, follow instructions from local authorities and leadership promptly.

During an emergency, people may to need to survive rely on their own supplies for several days, and a kit with food, water and other supplies with basic household items would be ideal. According to ready.gov, a basic kit includes:

Water

Food

Battery-powered or hand-crank radio and a NOAA weather radio with tone alert

Flashlight

First aid kit

Extra batteries

Whistle (to signal for help)

Dust mask (to filter contaminated air)

Plastic sheeting, scissors and duct tape (to shelter in place)

Moist towelettes, garbage bags and plastic ties (for personal sanitation)

Wrench or pliers (to turn off utilities)

Manual can opener

Local maps

Cell phone with chargers and backup battery

Consider keeping smaller, portable kits in your vehicle and workplace in case you are away from home when an emergency occurs. Review and refresh your go kit every six months to ensure supplies are current and functional.

Personal preparedness reduces the strain on emergency responders and ensures that you and your family can weather disruptions safely. By assembling a go kit and staying connected to official Andrews information channels, you will be better prepared to respond quickly and effectively when storms approach.",https://d1ldvf68ux039x.cloudfront.net/thumbs/photos/2507/9182400/1000w_q95.jpg,N,0.0,2025-08-29 14:56:20.644886

While TRICARE Prime is only available to eligible beneficiaries in Prime Service Areas (designated regions that have proximity to military hospitals or clinics), TPR extends coverage beyond PSAs. This plan helps active duty service members and their family members get care when they live or work in areas that are remote from military hospitals or clinics.

“TPR helps you get high-quality care, wherever you are,” said Shane Pham, management and program analyst, TRICARE Health Plan Policy & Programs Branch, at the Defense Health Agency. “TRICARE is committed to supporting you and your family, wherever you’re called to serve.”

A: With TPR, you don’t pay enrollment fees. You have the same coverage as TRICARE Prime. You pay nothing for health care when you see your primary care manager or use a referral to see a network provider.

Q: How do I get care?

A: With TPR, you’ll have a PCM who takes care of most of your health needs. Your PCM might be:

A provider in the TRICARE network, if one is nearby

Any TRICARE-authorized provider, if no network PCMs are available

Your PCM will:

Refer you to specialists when needed

Work with TRICARE for approvals

Help find network specialists

File your claims

Q: What are my costs?

A: If you follow the rules for getting care with your TPR plan, you can lower your costs. There are no out-of-pocket costs for covered services. (Note: If you get care without a referral, you may have to pay point-of-service fees.)

You’ll have copayments for prescriptions filled through the TRICARE Pharmacy Program.

Q: How do I choose the right plan for me?

A: When picking a health plan:

Compare TPR with other TRICARE health plans.

Organized by the MCP Working Group, the summit brought together leaders from the Army, Navy, Air Force, Health Affairs, and the Defense Health Agency, alongside representatives from more than 20 partnered civilian centers. The event focused on sharing policy updates, exchanging lessons learned, and aligning partnerships with operational readiness to ensure a strong return on investment—both now and in the future.

Jonathan Woodson, MD, MSS, FACS, president of the Uniformed Services University of the Health Sciences (USUHS) and former Assistant Secretary of Defense for Health Affairs, opened the summit with a keynote address. He highlighted the critical role of partnerships in sustaining readiness, not only for individual military providers but also in bolstering national disaster response through the National Disaster Medical System.

Throughout the summit, partners from across the country shared insights on topics such as tracking clinical experience for providers, nurses, and medics; establishing offices for military-civilian integration; and embedding active duty personnel in partner programs. Captain Matthew Tadlock, MD, FACS, USN, ESS president, led a dedicated session spotlighting the wide range of partnership models—from fully embedded physicians or surgical teams to enlisted-only just-in-time training, rotating surgical teams, and rotating special operations medics at regular intervals—demonstrating that while implementation may vary, all efforts aim to improve combat casualty care.

An important panel, “Integrating General Surgeons into Your Trauma Program,” featured representatives from the Air Force’s Centers for the Sustainment of Trauma and Readiness Skills (CSTARS) in St. Louis, Missouri, and Cincinnati, Ohio, as well as the Navy’s Expeditionary Resuscitative Surgical System embedded in Chicago, Illinois. Most forward surgical Role II capabilities across the services have general surgeons on their teams. These surgeons embedded in trauma-specific MCPs need to be ready for a combat casualty care mission, but also need to maintain their general surgery skillset. Panelists emphasized the critical role of general surgeons in trauma teams, while highlighting the value of emergency general surgery and elective clinical opportunities for maintaining both deployment readiness and surgical proficiency as general surgeons.

Immediate ESS Past-President Colonel Jennifer Gurney, MD, FACS, Chief of the Joint Trauma System (JTS), emphasized the necessity of a globally integrated approach to trauma care, highlighting how partnerships are instrumental to that vision. Colonel (Retired) Brian Eastridge, MD, FACS, US Army, Medical Director of the ACS Military Health System Strategic Partnership, discussed applying similar systems-level approaches at national and regional levels through integrated military and civilian efforts. Colonel Sarady Tan, MD, representing Health Affairs, provided a timely update on the MISSION ZERO Act, which offers federal funding opportunities to sustain qualifying military-civilian partnerships. This initiative helps ensure continuous access to trauma care while maintaining provider readiness.

The summit laid the foundation for a growing community of partnerships united by a shared mission. By mentoring newer sites and speaking with a unified voice, these collaborations can advance military medical readiness and national disaster preparedness.

If you’re a military member, reservist, or family member covered by Tricare insurance, finding a Tricare-approved psychiatrist for mental health treatment is crucial. At Advanced TMS Clinic in Lemon Grove, we are proud to be an in-network provider with Tricare, offering specialized Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (TMS) therapy for conditions like Major Depressive Disorder (MDD) and other treatment-resistant mood disorders. Our dedicated team ensures that you receive compassionate, effective, and accessible mental health care tailored to your needs.

Why Choose a Tricare-Approved Psychiatrist?

Tricare insurance provides comprehensive coverage for active duty military personnel, reservists, and their families, including mental health services. By choosing a Tricare-approved psychiatrist at Advanced TMS Clinic, you can access cutting-edge TMS therapy with the confidence that your treatment is covered under your Tricare plan, reducing out-of-pocket costs and simplifying the process. Our team works closely with Tricare to verify benefits and ensure seamless access to care.

Benefits of Choosing Advanced TMS Clinic

In-Network with Tricare: As a Tricare-approved provider, we streamline the insurance process, making TMS therapy accessible for qualifying conditions.

Specialized Care for Military Communities: We understand the unique mental health challenges faced by service members and their families, offering stigma-free, compassionate treatment.

FDA-Approved TMS Therapy: TMS is a non-invasive, drug-free treatment that targets depression and other mood disorders, ideal for those who haven’t found relief with traditional medications.

Personalized Treatment Plans: Our experienced psychiatrists create tailored plans to address your specific mental health needs.

What is TMS Therapy?

Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (TMS) is an FDA-approved, non-invasive treatment that uses magnetic fields to stimulate specific areas of the brain responsible for mood regulation. Unlike antidepressants, which rely on systemic medication delivery, TMS directly targets underactive brain regions to “wake up” dormant synapses, helping alleviate symptoms of depression and other mood disorders.

At Advanced TMS Clinic, we use NeuroStar Advanced TMS, a proven therapy with over 5.6 million treatments performed and an 83% response rate in real-world studies. For military personnel and their families dealing with treatment-resistant depression, TMS offers a safe and effective alternative without the common side effects of medications, such as weight gain or fatigue.

Why Military Personnel and Families Trust Advanced TMS Clinic

Military life comes with unique stressors, and mental health challenges like depression or anxiety can be particularly prevalent. At Advanced TMS Clinic, our Tricare-approved psychiatrists are committed to supporting the military community by providing:

Expert Care: Our team includes experienced psychiatrists and clinicians trained in TMS therapy.

Convenient Access: We verify Tricare benefits upfront to ensure coverage and minimize costs.

Proven Results: Clinical data shows that 62% of patients who complete a NeuroStar TMS treatment cycle achieve remission from depression symptoms.

No Sedation or Recovery Time: TMS sessions are relaxing, with minimal discomfort and no need for anesthesia.

How to Access TMS Therapy with Tricare

Getting started with TMS therapy at Advanced TMS Clinic is simple:

Verify Benefits: Contact our team to confirm your Tricare coverage for TMS therapy.

Schedule a Consultation: Meet with our Tricare-approved psychiatrist to assess if TMS is right for you.

Personalized Treatment: If eligible, we’ll develop a customized TMS treatment plan to address your mental health needs.

Most Tricare plans cover TMS therapy for Major Depressive Disorder (MDD) if you’ve tried at least two antidepressant medications without sufficient relief. Our team will guide you through the eligibility process and handle insurance coordination.

Additional Support for Veterans

In addition to Tricare, Advanced TMS Clinic partners with TriWest and the Veterans Affairs (VA) system to provide TMS therapy for veterans. Through TriWest’s administration of the VA’s Community Care Program, veterans can access our services under their VA benefits. Our facility is approved to offer TMS therapy, ensuring veterans receive the care they deserve.

Berst said, “We have a complicated mission, supporting our combatant command partners, our military service partners, and more.

Flanders said his various divisions do this by:

Protecting and securing the medical network and data by meeting Department of Defense cybersecurity requirements

Facilitating continuous support to DHA’s clinical care enterprise

Aligning resources to modernize the DHA IT infrastructure with the work of DOD chief information officers and other DOD agencies

Driving financial auditability compliance

The DHA-sponsored symposium showcases the latest developments in health IT, featuring insights from leaders in government, the military, and industry. The symposium provides an opportunity to share knowledge and innovative ideas, discuss lessons learned, and introduce new developments that enhance the military healthcare delivery system.

Kathleen Berst, acting DHA assistant director for support and component acquisition executive, talked about how the DHA supports mission readiness by “rethinking the way we’re doing business,” and how the DHA needs to leverage partnerships to modernize military health.

Berst said, “We have a complicated mission, supporting our combatant command partners, our military service partners, and more. But forums such as DHITS help ensure we can bring the best of the military, government, industry, and academia together to deliver on that mission.”

“The National Guard is continually on the front lines both at home and abroad.
In recent years, Guardsmen have responded to hurricanes, floods, wildfires, civil disturbances, border crossings and even the worst public health crisis in a century without medical coverage, McGinn said.
That would provide Guardsmen and Reservists medical coverage on par with their active-component counterparts, McGinn said.
“We would never debate the need to provide medical coverage for active-component troops,” he said.","Almost one in five members of the Guard and Reserve has no health insurance

WASHINGTON, D.C. (Aug. 28, 2025) — The voice of current and former National Guard officers nationwide is applauding a Senate bill that would ensure that every member of the National Guard and Reserves has access to health care.

Introduced by Sen. Tammy Baldwin, D-Wis., the Healthcare for Our Troops Act (S. 2575) would offer premium-free, zero-cost-share medical coverage to every Guardsman and Reservist through TRICARE, the military’s health insurance program.

Currently, about 130,000 Guardsmen and Reservists have no medical coverage, according to the National Guard Bureau at the Pentagon. Hundreds of thousands more pay for their own coverage or rely on employer-provided health insurance.

“The National Guard is continually on the front lines both at home and abroad. Comprehensive healthcare is not a benefit; it’s a necessity for readiness,” said retired Maj. Gen. Francis M. McGinn, the NGAUS president.

“Readiness begins with wellness, and wellness begins with access,” McGinn added. “For less than 1% of the Department of Defense health care budget, we can ensure a ready reserve component. Our Guardsmen need this, and our nation needs them. I thank Senator Baldwin and her staff for their dedication to the National Guard and for their work on this effort.”

Current law provides coverage to part-time Guardsmen and Reservists only when they are federally mobilized on orders for more than 30 days. Most of the Guard’s domestic missions are of a shorter duration. Many are conducted under state active duty, which provides no health care.

In recent years, Guardsmen have responded to hurricanes, floods, wildfires, civil disturbances, border crossings and even the worst public health crisis in a century without medical coverage, McGinn said.

In addition, Guardsmen must also be medically ready to respond to the state or nation with little to no notice. This can be challenging for the almost one in five who have no private coverage and lack access to routine, preventive health care, McGinn added.

S. 2575 would also enable Guardsmen and Reservists to complete annual medical readiness requirements with their preferred civilian provider — giving commanders back valuable training days and saving more than $162 million annually in contracted medical assessments.

The legislation fixes all that by enrolling Guardsmen and Reservists into TRICARE Reserve Select at no cost.

TRS is currently a partially subsidized program for drilling Guardsmen and Reservists. They cover a monthly premium and co-pays for services. The legislation would eliminate all of those costs for participants.

That would provide Guardsmen and Reservists medical coverage on par with their active-component counterparts, McGinn said.

“We would never debate the need to provide medical coverage for active-component troops,” he said. “We need to view Guard Soldiers and Airmen in the same light.

“This legislation would also provide the Guard with a game-changing recruiting and retention tool, which would go a long way toward paying for the coverage,” he added. “And it will make our Soldiers and Airmen more attractive in the civilian job market. It’s the right thing to do for the Guard and the nation.”

In fact, these numbers were based on the result of a data error in military records from the US Department of Defense (DoD), which was corrected more than three years ago.

The real rises were much smaller—and the evidence doesn’t tell us they were caused by the Covid vaccines anyway.

The post features a video of a man called Thomas Renz citing data that he says comes from the Defense Medical Database (DMED) during a panel discussion [4:55:05] about the Covid-19 response, hosted by the US Senator Ron Johnson in January 2022. This is how we know that the “jabs” referred to in the Facebook post relate to Covid.

Mr Renz says in the video: “We have substantial data showing that we saw, for example, miscarriages increased by 300% over the five-year average, almost. We saw almost a 300% increase in cancer over the five-year average… Neurological issues, which would affect our pilots, over a 1,000% increase.”

In fact, these numbers are based on a data error. A spokesperson for the Defense Health Agency’s Armed Forces Surveillance Division told Politifact, another fact checker, in 2022 that they came from a comparison with faulty data from the past, which made the rate of these and other conditions in 2016-2020 seem much too low. So when the more complete 2021 data was compared against that faulty baseline, it created the false impression of dramatic spikes in various conditions.

Senator Johnson himself later acknowledged receipt of a document from the DoD, which explained that the error happened during a server migration. As the document said: “The data for years 2016 through 2020 contained only approximately 10% of the true number of outpatient medical encounters for that period, which created an inaccurate appearance that diagnoses for medical conditions increased when compared to previous years.”

While the document doesn’t give a figure for the correct rise in miscarriage or cancer encounter rates in general, it says the correct figure for neurological issues was 3%, and cites a number of increases for specific cancers that are well below 300%. The number of testicular cancer encounters rose 3%, for example, not 369%. For breast cancer, it was 1.1% instead of 487%.

This has nothing to do with Covid vaccines anyway

It’s worth saying that even after the error was corrected, this data can’t be used to calculate the change in the rates of these conditions—let alone any changes caused by the Covid vaccines.

The data measures the number of “outpatient medical encounters” for active service members, meaning the number of times they had contact with medical staff for given conditions. There might be more than one encounter per condition, and the encounters recorded in a given year might relate to a condition that developed much earlier.

As the DoD notes in its document, “Counts of health care encounters are not representative of new cases of these diagnoses; they are a measure of the workload for the health system regarding provision of care associated with these diagnoses. Counts of health care encounters cannot be used as a proxy for the prevalence of disease.”

In short: “The ability to make inferences from the data using the available preset queries is very limited… To address specific questions on Service members’ health, a more thorough analysis is required.”

Besides, even if this data did show a change in prevalence, it still wouldn’t tell us that the change was caused by the Covid vaccines. Some people may have had these conditions before being vaccinated, while others may have developed them for other reasons.

We, and other fact checkers, have written about this error when it has been the source of misinformation several times before.

Serious side effects from Covid vaccination do occur on rare occasions. But the MHRA, which monitors their safety in the UK, says: “The benefits of the vaccines in preventing COVID-19 and serious complications associated with COVID-19 far outweigh any currently known side effects in the majority of patients.”

Office for National Statistics data shows that, in England, 63 deaths involving Covid vaccines were registered up to July 2023. But analysis from the UK Health Security Agency found that the vaccines prevented 127,500 deaths in England up to 24 September 2021. Overall, it is estimated that they save millions of lives worldwide.

Bad information can be dangerous if people use it to make decisions about their health.

(KOAA) — The community stepped up to help raise more than $50,000 in just three days through a Zeffy fundraiser to help SFC David Hong, but Hong isn't keeping a dime of that money.

""Life is more important than anything,"" SFC Hong said to News5 in a video interview.

Hong joined the Army when he was 36, now 52. He worked as a religious affairs specialist and he's been battling stage 4 colon cancer in recent years as he goes through the medical retirement process. The cancer was discovered during a routine colonoscopy. He came to Fort Carson's Solider Recovery Unit in September of 2023 to receive support after the diagnosis.

""I mean, it was pretty devastating, especially for my wife and my family,"" Hong stated.

For about two to three years, Hong underwent 23 treatments of chemo and several surgeries. But the cancer kept coming back. His wife did some research and learned of a procedure called histotripsy, a non-invasive procedure that uses ultrasound waves to essentially liquify tumor cells. The procedure was pricey, and TRICARE didn't cover it.

Hong's wife was able to connect with an organization called HunterSeven, a veteran-founded group that conducts research on military exposures among post-9/11 veterans and educates the veteran and healthcare population on critical health information relating to their exposures. HunterSeven helped set up the fundraiser that raised tens of thousands of dollars in a matter of days for Hong.

""We were just blown away by the love,"" Hong said. ""Ultimately, this is bigger than me. It was about fighting cancer and being able to do this treatment that would be less invasive.""

Hong said HunterSeven also helped him go through the waiver request process with TRICARE, ultimately, Hong says he was approved for the procedure through TRICARE via the waiver. Hong says the money raised is now going to help others. Hong had the treatment earlier this month. He will undergo regular screenings in the coming months, but he's hopeful that this procedure was a success.

""Even though we might live in a society that might be imperfect, I think we need to focus on the things that are positive,"" Hong said. ""We're so thankful. And cancer is a horrible disease and illness, and I will never want anybody to go through it.""

The Defense Health Agency sent News5 the following statement about histotripsy:

""DHA is aware of recent discussion regarding histotripsy. We are prohibited by HIPAA and the Privacy Act to release Protected Health Information or Personally Identifiable Information on any TRICARE beneficiary.

That said, as a standard practice, the Department monitors and continuously assesses and reassesses available evidence on emerging treatments and technologies to determine the safety and effectiveness of new treatments. The Department assessed histotripsy, an emerging treatment, as a part of its standard practice in 2024, and found the treatment did not meet the Federal statutory requirements for coverage under TRICARE.The available evidence on histotripsy is scarce and of low quality, yielded no clinically relevant outcomes, and included no professional guidelines or opinions on the use of histotripsy for liver tumors.

TRICARE beneficiaries retain access to TRICARE covered, established, evidence-based treatment options through military medical treatment facilities (MTFs) and private sector TRICARE-authorized providers. Referrals for care from MTF or TRICARE-authorized providers do not mean automatic coverage of non-covered services.

Gen. John Andrus, then the Joint Staff Surgeon; and Dr. Stephen Ferrara, acting assistant secretary of defense for health affairs, listen as Navy Capt.","Air Force Brig. Gen. (Dr.) John R. Andrus recently served as the Joint Staff Surgeon, culminating a 37-year career in military health. Like his predecessors, he brought deep experience and insight to advise top leadership within the Department of Defense on all matters concerning military health care -- family medicine, operational readiness, and warfighter health — at home, in theater, and in space.

He held the role as the top military medical advisor to the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff since June 2023, and this summer turned the reigns over to the current JSS, Army Brig. Gen. Clinton K. Murray.

Andrus sat down with MHS News to talk about the role of the JSS and how his career prepared him for that work. He officially retires from military service on Sept. 1, 2025.

He said it’s vital for his role to understand the Military Health System from “the joint force perspective, because what the chairman is interested in is how prepared the MHS is to support the joint force.”

As JSS, he’s not only the senior medical advisor to the Chairman and the Joint Staff, but also the combatant commanders. The work stems across the entire DOD, to include collaborating with the service surgeons general and the assistant secretary of defense for health affairs.

After graduating from the Uniformed Services University of the Health Sciences in Bethesda, Maryland, in 1993, Andrus has supported a wide spectrum of military medical missions around the world.

After completing his residency in family medicine at David Grant USAF Medical Center at Travis Air Force Base, his first assignment was overseas in the Azores. Andrus called it “a blessing of going to USU, because they wanted people with military experience before they sent them overseas, particularly to a remote area.” His team served 3,000 service members and their families, with just four family practice physicians. “It was rural medicine at its best,” Andrus said. It was there that he knew he wanted to be a military flight surgeon.

He attended flight surgeon school at Brooks City-Base in Texas and got his first flight surgeon assignment at Ramstein Air Base, Germany. He spent three years there supporting the medical group and flying air medical evacuation missions with the 76th Airlift Squadron, a C-9 squadron. He also flew with the 37th Airlift Squadron, a C-130 squadron.

During this phase of his decorated career, he served as a NASA flight surgeon, leading DOD support to NASA. When the space shuttle would launch, his team would send an airplane to the designated transatlantic landing site and stand watch, prepared to provide medical support — setting up a small hospital in the back of a C-130 and waiting with pararescuemen. If needed, the pararescuemen would conduct the rescue mission, and Andrus’ team would cover medical evacuation, working together as a team. “We had to be trained and prepared to take the astronauts out of their spacesuits, evaluate them, and then get them back to CONUS,” he said of the role.

A soundtrack to these missions was the radio traffic between Houston and the astronauts, listening for their greeting on their way up to space reassured his medical evacuation team was there. When the space crew reported that they made their orbit — which took only a few seconds — his team would tear down, get back on the airplane, and fly back to Ramstein.

While serving as chief of aerospace medicine at the 62nd Medical Group at Joint Base Lewis-McChord, Washington, he got orders to his first joint assignment at United States Africa Command headquarters in Stuttgart, Germany, as the deputy surgeon general. This led to his next joint assignment at United States Transportation Command as the command surgeon.

His keen ability to collaborate across services and invaluable experience in warfighter health care paved the way for him to serve as the JSS.

During his final interview in uniform, Andrus shared his insights of how the JSS helps ensure high-quality health care is delivered to warfighters who are being asked to complete missions circling the Earth, around the globe, or at home — in his words, “wherever they may be.”

Question: What is the role of the Joint Staff Surgeon?

Andrus: What's contained in that role is a need to understand the MHS. If I'm offering recommendations to the chairman as he formulates his advice to the Secretary of Defense, I need to have a good understanding. I need to be able to scan the MHS and understand from the joint force perspective, because what the chairman is interested in is how prepared is the MHS to support the joint force. The chairman is being asked to support a mission by the President for a reason: If an action needs to be taken somewhere around the globe to create an effect, we have military forces across multiple services designed to do certain things that in a combined effort are intended to accomplish certain objectives. For that to occur, there needs to be medical support to those forces as they're preparing to deploy or provide support to other missions. There also needs to be support forward to make sure they remain healthy and that they're able to perform at their peak performance level. If things go wrong, patients can be recovered, treated, and then put back in the system right.

The MHS has one mission: To care for our service members.

Question: Talk about how you work with the chairman, the Joint Staff, the combatant commanders, the service surgeons general, and the assistant secretary of defense for health affairs.

Andrus: My role is to collaborate with them. I sit at the table. What's important to note is that at that table, all voices should be equal. And the joint voice at that table is particularly unique because it brings a perspective looking across the entire health system. The service surgeons general bring incredibly valuable, organized voices to the table that are service-specific, so we understand the service equities. I have my own voice from an operational side and then from a joint side, we try to align those activities to what's required. I represent the mission.

My role with Health Affairs is to make sure that we're collaborative.

Dr. Stephen Ferrara

(acting assistant secretary of defense for health affairs) has a very significant role as the resource manager for the defense health program funding. The chairman's voice also comes across to the secretary (of defense) in terms of resourcing as well. So, you've got two voices that are coming from two different points in the organization. It’s a unit. I have an independent voice representing the chairman and representing, most importantly, the joint force. That collaboration is critical to make sure that we are aligned.

Question: Describe the Joint Staff Surgeon’s role in navigating changes in the MHS.

Andrus: The MHS itself has gone from a service-centric entity to a much more joint-oriented entity. You have to know what you're doing and how all the parts work together. You have to know how to engage in the system. People don't realize how large the MHS is. About a year ago, I talked to the chairman about some of the core challenges in the MHS -- what were some gaps, perhaps in our preparedness to do the things we might be asked to do, right from an operational perspective.

When I arrived, the Defense Health Agency was only a year into having administrative authority, direction control over the MTFs (military hospitals and clinics), which was hard to overestimate how much tectonic change that meant for the system. We asked, “What are the impacts of that change?”

There was a change in the structure and now in new realignment of responsibilities and authorities. We analyzed if the resources aligned to those new responsibilities, asking, “What's at the root of some of the challenges that we're trying to overcome?”

Question: What are the next steps to address challenges with the MHS?

Andrus: We have been working the capability portfolio management review now for coming up on a year, and we've had some incredible insights that have come out of it —not just from trying to solve the surface problem but understanding what's underlying and really getting after the systemic issues that need to be resolved to move forward.

We're going to ask for permission to go back and reassess our joint capability areas as a foundational element to build and define capability portfolios across the entire military medical mission. We have to remember the mission is taking care of service members. The mission is measured by the combat effectiveness of the units we support. We have to broaden that definition to include our partners that can provide the services with medics that are trained, equipped, and ready to go.

Question: What do you envision for the future of the MHS?

Andrus: We’re at a point in time right now where we have an opportunity to really advance the MHS. If somebody asks me, “What's the one thing that we should do?” I say, “To improve the MHS.” We can be too focused on differences. We need to be more focused on where there’s alignment and build on that alignment. Each leader needs to recommit themselves to leaning in and working together. That means that we need to understand the mission from the same sight picture, and we need to lean into that mission and allow individual opinions, desires, and preferences to go by the wayside as we figure out the most effective way to get the mission done: To support the warfighter.

Andrus leaves behind a legacy of dedication to warfighter and family health, a core focus on resiliency of the joint force, and an encouragement to continue what the MHS strives for: working together to improve the health of all those entrusted to its care.

“As we collaborate and coordinate to understand each other, we have to come together on areas where it makes sense,” he said. “Then, we are more effective to help the MHS move forward.”

About 130,000 Guardsmen and Reservists currently have no medical coverage. Hundreds of thousands more pay for their own coverage or rely on employer-provided health insurance.

Baldwin spoke at the 147th General Conference & Exhibition on Saturday in Milwaukee, where she received the NGAUS Harry S. Truman Award, the association’s highest honor.

“We’ve fallen short in a pretty crucial area and that is basic health care,” she told attendees. “I believe that’s morally wrong. It’s bad for preparedness and readiness. And yes, we need to change it.”

“Readiness begins with wellness, and wellness begins with access,” said retired Maj. Gen. Francis M. McGinn, the NGAUS president. “For less than 1% of the Department of Defense health care budget, we can ensure a ready reserve component.

“Our Guardsmen need this, and our nation needs them,” he added. “I thank Senator Baldwin and her staff for their dedication to the National Guard and for their work on this effort.”

Current law provides coverage to part-time Guardsmen and Reservists only when they are federally mobilized on orders for more than 30 days. Most of the Guard’s domestic missions are of a shorter duration. Many are conducted under state active duty, which provides no health care.

In addition, Guardsmen must also be medically ready to respond to the state or nation with little to no notice. This can be challenging for the almost one in five who have no private coverage and lack access to routine, preventive health care, McGinn added.

Zero-cost TRICARE is a top NGAUS legislative priority.

Both the House and Senate have considered legislation to expand medical coverage to part-time service members in recent years. Major legislation such as this often requires several years to win congressional approval.

S. 2575 would enroll Guardsmen and Reservists into TRICARE Reserve Select at no cost.

TRS is currently a partially subsidized program for drilling Guardsmen and Reservists. They cover a monthly premium and co-pays for services. The legislation would eliminate all those costs.

That would provide Guardsmen and Reservists medical coverage on par with their active-component counterparts, McGinn said.

“We would never debate the need to provide medical coverage for active-component troops,” he said. “We need to view Guard Soldiers and Airmen in the same light.”",https://www.ngaus.org/sites/default/files/styles/max_1300x1300/public/2025-08/082825tricare1000.jpg?itok=D_MM1TYJ,N,0.0,2025-08-28 11:56:53.164321

BOSTON, Aug. 05, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Amwell® (NYSE: AMWL), a leading technology-enabled care platform provider, announced that as part of a Leidos-led partnership, it has been awarded an extension of its next-generation Digital First contract to power the digital transformation of the Military Health System (MHS), which serves approximately 9.6 million beneficiaries.

Under the contract extension, Amwell will continue to provide its comprehensive technology-enabled care platform to power virtual care delivered by MHS providers. The platform for scheduled virtual visits has been successfully deployed, on time and on budget, across the global DOD enterprise and to the U.S. Military Entrance Processing Command (MEPCOM) and the U.S. Coast Guard (USCG).

The platform replaced the MHS Video Connect solution, enabling providers with tech-enabled care. It is fully integrated within the MHS electronic health record and continues to enable the provision of dynamic health solutions for our military care teams, service members, and their families.

Through integrated platform solutions, Amwell is contributing to important efficiency initiatives, reducing burdens on care teams, improving the health and wellness of beneficiaries, reducing healthcare costs and optimizing the effective utilization of DHA's clinical resources across their global enterprise.

“Our platform is in use across the global DOD enterprise, enabling high quality, efficient care for this important population. We are grateful for the service of our nation’s military, and we are proud to be supporting their wellbeing,” said Ido Schoenberg, M.D., chairman and CEO of Amwell. “We are honored to extend this relationship and support the Department of Defense initiatives to realize the benefits of tech-enabled care across the MHS.”

The DHA’s Digital Front Door initiative has brought new capabilities and enablement to MHS GENESIS, an advanced electronic health record (EHR) and healthcare system solution that supports military and Veteran healthcare initiatives. The Amwell platform has deep integration assets and a simple yet powerful user experience that enables efficient and high-quality technology-enabled care delivery. The platform is already embedded into existing clinical workflows that care teams rely on, including those within the MHS GENESIS EHR. Amwell is providing technology to enable the DHA to leverage the benefits of hybrid care, improve access to healthcare, and ultimately improve outcomes for the MHS community.

Some highlights of platform success to date include:

Nearly tripling of virtual visits since replacing the DHA’s MHS Video Connect capability

Recent expansion beyond DHA sites to include MHS beneficiaries in the USCG and U.S. MEPCOM

Successful virtual visits from deployed units in a combat zone connected to a military hospital in the United States

The DHA supports U.S. national security and ensures our nation’s military teams are ready to deploy. Digital First supports the entire MHS community of users, which includes approximately 9.6 million active-duty service members, family members, retirees, and health professionals across the continuum of care.

Defense Health Agency officials, in a response to Military Times, contended the change corrects unauthorized coverage that Tricare has been providing to beneficiaries who weren’t eligible for the weight-loss medications.
Tricare will continue to cover those weight-loss medications for younger beneficiaries — those enrolled in Tricare Prime or Tricare Select or premium-based plans.
The premium-based plans include Tricare Young Adult, Tricare Reserve Select, Tricare Retired Reserve and Continued Health Care Benefit Program.
The issue of coverage of weight-loss medications has a complicated regulatory and legislative history with conflicting guidance, she said.","Just a few days before coverage for weight-loss drugs is set to end for Tricare for Life beneficiaries, advocates are calling on the Defense Health Agency and lawmakers to halt those plans.

A new policy takes effect Aug. 31 for Wegovy, Zepbound, Saxenda, Qsymia, Phentermine and Contrave, affecting coverage of those drugs for weight-loss purposes. Tricare for Life is the Tricare plan for Medicare-eligible military retirees and their Medicare-eligible family members.

Defense Health Agency officials, in a response to Military Times, contended the change corrects unauthorized coverage that Tricare has been providing to beneficiaries who weren’t eligible for the weight-loss medications.

Tricare will continue to cover those weight-loss medications for younger beneficiaries — those enrolled in Tricare Prime or Tricare Select or premium-based plans. Those beneficiaries still must have prior authorizations for the weight-loss drugs. They must also meet Tricare’s clinical criteria and have a prescription from a Tricare network provider.

The premium-based plans include Tricare Young Adult, Tricare Reserve Select, Tricare Retired Reserve and Continued Health Care Benefit Program.

Current plans to end this coverage “risk the progress made by patients taking these medications and cast doubt on the future of the [Tricare for Life] benefit,” wrote Karen Ruedisueli, director of health affairs in government relations for the Military Officers Association of America, on the nonprofit organization’s website.

She said MOAA has sent an email to DHA officials expressing their concerns, and she noted they’re getting considerable feedback from their members.

The issue of coverage of weight-loss medications has a complicated regulatory and legislative history with conflicting guidance, she said. Thus, “halting this policy change would provide time to assess the legislative and regulatory history governing Tricare policy on weight loss medications and determine next steps to avert negative impacts to beneficiaries,” she wrote in the article calling for a halt in the plans.

In an Aug. 5 press release that included information about the change, Tricare officials said the Defense Health Agency is “implementing regulatory controls” on weight-loss medication coverage.

“Tricare has been providing coverage for weight loss medications to beneficiaries who were not eligible under federal statute. This implementation corrects that unauthorized coverage,” DHA spokesperson Brenda Campbell said in an email response to Military Times’ questions about the reasons for ending the coverage.

She noted that different laws govern Tricare Prime and Tricare Select.

“These laws allow DOD to offer certain health care services and health benefits when received from network providers under those plan options that are not available to [Tricare for Life] beneficiaries,” Campbell said. “Some Tricare for Life beneficiaries were found to have received coverage for these medications inconsistent with existing statutory and regulatory authority.”

In the Aug. 5 announcement of the change, Defense Health Agency Chief Medical Officer Dr. Paul Cordts said “people are taking GLP-1 drugs — like Wegovy and Zepbound — for weight loss now more than ever. It’s important to understand how — and why — Tricare covers these drugs, based on your condition and status.”

In an email to Military Times, one Tricare for Life beneficiary prescribed Wegovy said she feels as if Tricare officials “are saying we are subpar members, not as worthy as the Prime or Select members.”

“Wegovy has been a miracle for my medical conditions of obesity, metabolic syndrome, pre-diabetes, pre-hypertension, sleep apnea,” she added. “All of that improved with this medication. Now they just cut it off.”

The letter she received from Tricare stated she could continue filling her current prescription — and pay 100% of the drug cost. That amounts to $1,300 per month.

“That will take most of our retirement money,” she said.

GLP-1 drugs approved by the Food and Drug Administration for the treatment of diabetes will continue to be covered for all patients who have a diabetes diagnosis, when medically necessary and when prior authorization requirements are met, according to Tricare officials.

Tricare covers Trulicity, Ozempic, Mounjaro and Victoza to treat type 2 diabetes, with prior authorization. Ozempic, Mounjaro and Victoza require medical necessity forms for a formulary copayment and coverage at a military pharmacy, officials stated.

Since the change in coverage was announced, MOAA has received a considerable amount of feedback from its members, all of whom went through extensive prior authorization processes to document co-morbid conditions, lifestyle changes and trials of alternative medications before they met the clinical criteria for approval for the weight-loss medications, Ruedisueli wrote, adding that Tricare doesn’t cover these drugs for cosmetic purposes.

The members are worried their progress will be reversed if they can no longer use these drugs.

“A physician from Walter Reed National Military Medical Center also reached out to MOAA with concerns about the new policy and its impact on Walter Reed’s military retiree patients,” Ruedisueli wrote.

And members who aren’t directly affected have another concern: that the change represents a terrible precedent and could lead to further targeted cuts to Tricare for Life. MOAA shares that concern, Ruedisueli wrote.",https://media.zenfs.com/en/military_times_968/049f7ab0fb1dc03131e1f3d5e2447776,N,0.0,2025-08-28 11:57:16.651987

2.0 Background:

2.1. The Defense Health Agency (DHA) is committed to providing the highest quality healthcare and support to our beneficiaries. DHA operates in a complex environment, generating and managing a vast amount of data across multiple clinical and administrative systems, and supporting business operations, combat support missions, and healthcare delivery. While we have accumulated a significant volume of data, DHA seeks a modern, integrated approach to transform this data into actionable insights, enabling data-driven decision-making, continuous improvement, and enhanced organizational visibility.

Historically, this need was addressed through data warehousing concepts. However, we recognize that contemporary data landscapes demand more sophisticated and interconnected solutions that leverage the latest technologies and methodologies. DHA envisions a mature and interconnected data ecosystem that proactively identifies trends, patterns, and opportunities across its three core operational areas:

Business Operations: Optimizing headquarters-level healthcare delivery business operations that support the Networks and Military Treatment Facilities (MTFs) in delivering quality healthcare. This includes improving administrative functions, resource allocation, performance management, workflows, cost containment, and enhancing the user experience for both DHA personnel and the Networks/MTFs they support. The focus is on enabling efficient and effective healthcare delivery at the point of care.

Combat Support Mission: Ensuring readiness and providing effective healthcare support to the warfighter. This includes analyzing readiness metrics, identifying areas for improvement in medical training and deployment support, and optimizing resource allocation for contingency operations.

Healthcare Delivery: Improving patient outcomes, enhancing the quality of care, and ensuring patient safety. This includes analyzing patient data to identify trends in disease prevalence, optimizing treatment protocols, and reducing healthcare costs.

DHA seeks to enable a mature and interconnected data ecosystem that empowers data-driven decision-making and enables continuous improvement across its three core operational domains: Business Operations, Healthcare Delivery, and Combat Support. This is not a static solution, but rather a dynamic and evolving ecosystem that adapts to the changing needs of the DHA mission: providing high-quality healthcare to those who serve and their families. The desire is to have an environment where data becomes a strategic asset, driving tangible improvements in patient care, healthcare delivery efficiency, and combat readiness. We are particularly interested in solutions that deliver the following desired outcomes:

Provide a readily accessible, unified view of data, regardless of the source or format (structured or unstructured) to enable comprehensive analysis and informed decision-making.

Generate actionable insights to enable proactive identification of trends, patterns, and opportunities.

Allow stakeholders at all levels to easily access, understand, and interact with relevant data to inform their decisions.

Guarantee the security, privacy, and regulatory compliance of data. The solution must protect sensitive information, maintain data integrity, and comply with all applicable laws and regulations.

Facilitate the continuous monitoring and evaluation of key performance indicators (KPIs), enabling proactive identification of areas for improvement and tracking of progress towards organizational goals.

5.0 Unified Data Accessibility and Data-Driven Insights Use Cases.

The Defense Health Agency (DHA) desires to improve its ability to translate data into actionable insights and improved outcomes. The below proposed use cases are designed to describe the types of capabilities we desire. This is not an exhaustive list but is intended to kickstart the conversation.

USE CASE 1: Real-Time Blood Product Tracking and Management for Combat Casualty Care

Problem:

Blood and blood products are critical for saving lives on the battlefield. However, maintaining real-time visibility into blood product inventory levels, location, and expiration dates across the entire DHA (including deployed and fixed facilities) is a major challenge.

Lack of real-time data can lead to:

Shortages of blood products in critical locations.

Waste of expired blood products.

Delays in delivering blood to patients who need it most.

Inefficient movement of blood products between facilities.

Data Sources:

MHS GENESIS: Patient blood type information, transfusion history, point-of-care testing results at fixed facilities and Role 3 treatment facilities.

JOMIS (Joint Operational Medicine Information System): Real-time inventory of blood products at deployed medical facilities (Role 1, 2, and forward surgical teams (FST)), blood product usage data, location of medical units.

TRANSCOM (Transportation Command) Systems: Tracking of blood shipments from CONUS-based blood banks to deployed locations, real-time location of blood in transit, temperature monitoring data during transport.

DoD Blood Donor Program: Blood donor information, collection schedules, blood type distribution, and donor availability.

Blood Bank Information Systems (BBIS) (at fixed facilities): Comprehensive blood inventory management.

Third-Party Logistics (3PL) Providers (if used): Tracking of blood shipments.

Desired Blood Product Management Capabilities:

Unified view of blood product information across the DHA, encompassing inventory levels, location, expiration dates, and usage patterns (both historical and forecasted).

Automatically identify and alert key personnel to critical events affecting blood product availability, quality, or delivery.

Predict future blood product demand based on various factors, including historical usage, operational requirements, and potential emergency scenarios.

Optimize the allocation and distribution of blood products across the MHS to ensure timely availability where and when needed most.

Identify potential blood donors and target recruitment efforts to address specific blood type shortages and ensure adequate supply.

Real-time information on blood product availability during triage and casualty evacuation to inform treatment decisions.

Automatically initiate blood product resupply based on real-time consumption and projected demand, ensuring continuous availability.

Improve the planning and execution of blood drives and mobile blood collection units to maximize donation yields and meet regional and overall needs.

Minimize the likelihood of blood product shortages at critical locations across the DHA, safeguarding patient care.

Minimize the waste of expired blood products, improving resource utilization and reducing costs.

Expedite the delivery of blood products to casualties on the battlefield, improving survival outcomes.

Efficient and effective allocation of blood product resources across the MHS, maximizing the impact of limited supplies.

Increase overall blood donation rates to meet the ongoing needs of the warfighter and the DHA beneficiary population.

USE CASE 2: Unified Bed Management and Patient Flow Optimization Across the Continuum of Combat Care

Problem:

Efficient bed management is crucial for optimizing patient flow, maximizing resource utilization, and ensuring casualties receive the right level of care at the right time.

However, bed management in the DHA is complicated by the distributed nature of the system, the dynamic demands of deployed operations, and the need to seamlessly transition patients between different levels of care (Roles 1-3, FSTs, CONUS-based hospitals).

Lack of real-time visibility into bed availability, patient acuity, and resource constraints can lead to:

Overcrowding and delays in care.

Suboptimal allocation of resources (staff, equipment, beds).

Increased risk of adverse events (e.g., hospital-acquired infections).

Delays in medical evacuation (MEDEVAC) due to lack of available beds at higher echelons of care.

Poor coordination of patient transfers between facilities.

Data Sources:

MHS GENESIS: Bed availability, patient census, patient demographics, diagnoses, procedures, acuity scores, discharge plans, staffing levels at fixed facilities and Role 3 facilities.

JOMIS (Joint Operational Medicine Information System): Bed availability, patient census, patient demographics, injuries, illnesses, treatment provided at deployed medical facilities (Roles 1, 2, and FST), location of medical units.

TRANSCOM Systems: MEDEVAC request data, transportation schedules, patient movement tracking.

Medical Command (MEDCOM) Command and Control Systems: Overall operational picture, anticipated mass casualty events, surge capacity planning.

VA Systems (Cerner Millennium): Bed availability and patient data at VA hospitals for potential patient transfers.

Commercial Hospital Systems (if participating in the TRICARE network): Bed availability and patient data for potential patient transfers.

Device Data: Telemetry, wearable sensor data (with consent) providing real-time patient status.

Desired Unified Bed Management System Capabilities:

Unified and readily accessible view of bed availability, patient acuity levels, and resource constraints across the entire enterprise.

Allocate beds to patients based on a combination of factors, including patient acuity, medical needs, and available resources.

Forecast future bed demand based on historical utilization data, anticipated operational requirements, and potential surge events.

Optimize patient transfer processes between medical facilities, ensuring timely movement to the most appropriate level of care.

Facilitate effective surge capacity planning, enabling proactive identification of potential bottlenecks and development of strategies to expand bed capacity during emergency situations.

Real-time visibility into bed availability across all levels of the healthcare system.

Provide early indicators to alert relevant personnel to potential bed shortages or overcrowding situations.

Efficiently manage the number of beds by facility and across DHA.

USE CASE 3: Improving Patient Care and Outcomes through Optimized Resource Management

Problem: Balancing the need to provide timely and high-quality patient care with challenges in resource management. This manifests as:

Long wait times for appointments, hindering access to timely care.

Inefficient utilization of medical staff and facilities, leading to potential waste and reduced capacity.

Staffing shortages and inefficient scheduling, increasing workload and burnout for healthcare providers.

High no-show rates, further disrupting schedules and reducing the availability of appointments.

Increased cost related to redirecting care to local community providers.

Data Sources:

Appointment scheduling systems

Patient demographic data

Historical appointment data (including no-show rates)

Clinic/MTF resource availability (staff, equipment, rooms)

Staffing schedules and employee skill/certification data

Patient volume and service demand data

Geographic location data (for telehealth planning)

FMTS (Fourth Estate Manpower Tracking System) and UMD (Unit Manning Document): authoritative staffing plan for each MTF. Impacts the ability to dynamically adjust allocation of staffing resources based on real-time demand and operational need.

DCPDS (Defense Civilian Personnel Data System): alpha roster , the authoritative Human Resource system to track Civilian personnel and their assignment to positions on the UMD by department/clinic and functional area. To be considered as part of solutions for dynamically adjusting personnel resources.

Interface Control Data from the Military Personnel Systems, particularly real-time access to the DHP aligned military positions that each Service assigns to the DHA (HQs, Networks, and MTFs). The civilian personnel are only one portion of a large-scale problem in identifying available resources, ensuring accuracy with schedules, and providing automated solutions.

We're going to ask for permission to go back and reassess our joint capability areas as a foundational element to build and define capability portfolios across the entire military medical mission.","Air Force Brig. Gen. (Dr.) John R. Andrus recently served as the Joint Staff Surgeon, culminating a 37-year career in military health. Like his predecessors, he brought deep experience and insight to advise top leadership within the Department of Defense on all matters concerning military health care -- family medicine, operational readiness, and warfighter health — at home, in theater, and in space.

He held the role as the top military medical advisor to the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff since June 2023, and this summer turned the reigns over to the current JSS, Army Brig. Gen. Clinton K. Murray.

Andrus sat down with MHS News to talk about the role of the JSS and how his career prepared him for that work. He officially retires from military service on Sept. 1, 2025.

He said it’s vital for his role to understand the Military Health System from “the joint force perspective, because what the chairman is interested in is how prepared the MHS is to support the joint force.”

As JSS, he’s not only the senior medical advisor to the Chairman and the Joint Staff, but also the combatant commanders. The work stems across the entire DOD, to include collaborating with the service surgeons general and the assistant secretary of defense for health affairs.

After graduating from the Uniformed Services University of the Health Sciences in Bethesda, Maryland, in 1993, Andrus has supported a wide spectrum of military medical missions around the world.

After completing his residency in family medicine at David Grant USAF Medical Center at Travis Air Force Base, his first assignment was overseas in the Azores. Andrus called it “a blessing of going to USU, because they wanted people with military experience before they sent them overseas, particularly to a remote area.” His team served 3,000 service members and their families, with just four family practice physicians. “It was rural medicine at its best,” Andrus said. It was there that he knew he wanted to be a military flight surgeon.

He attended flight surgeon school at Brooks City-Base in Texas and got his first flight surgeon assignment at Ramstein Air Base, Germany. He spent three years there supporting the medical group and flying air medical evacuation missions with the 76th Airlift Squadron, a C-9 squadron. He also flew with the 37th Airlift Squadron, a C-130 squadron.

During this phase of his decorated career, he served as a NASA flight surgeon, leading DOD support to NASA. When the space shuttle would launch, his team would send an airplane to the designated transatlantic landing site and stand watch, prepared to provide medical support — setting up a small hospital in the back of a C-130 and waiting with pararescuemen. If needed, the pararescuemen would conduct the rescue mission, and Andrus’ team would cover medical evacuation, working together as a team. “We had to be trained and prepared to take the astronauts out of their spacesuits, evaluate them, and then get them back to CONUS,” he said of the role.

A soundtrack to these missions was the radio traffic between Houston and the astronauts, listening for their greeting on their way up to space reassured his medical evacuation team was there. When the space crew reported that they made their orbit — which took only a few seconds — his team would tear down, get back on the airplane, and fly back to Ramstein.

While serving as chief of aerospace medicine at the 62nd Medical Group at Joint Base Lewis-McChord, Washington, he got orders to his first joint assignment at United States Africa Command headquarters in Stuttgart, Germany, as the deputy surgeon general. This led to his next joint assignment at United States Transportation Command as the command surgeon.

His keen ability to collaborate across services and invaluable experience in warfighter health care paved the way for him to serve as the JSS.

During his final interview in uniform, Andrus shared his insights of how the JSS helps ensure high-quality health care is delivered to warfighters who are being asked to complete missions circling the Earth, around the globe, or at home — in his words, “wherever they may be.”

Question: What is the role of the Joint Staff Surgeon?

Andrus: What's contained in that role is a need to understand the MHS. If I'm offering recommendations to the chairman as he formulates his advice to the Secretary of Defense, I need to have a good understanding. I need to be able to scan the MHS and understand from the joint force perspective, because what the chairman is interested in is how prepared is the MHS to support the joint force. The chairman is being asked to support a mission by the President for a reason: If an action needs to be taken somewhere around the globe to create an effect, we have military forces across multiple services designed to do certain things that in a combined effort are intended to accomplish certain objectives. For that to occur, there needs to be medical support to those forces as they're preparing to deploy or provide support to other missions. There also needs to be support forward to make sure they remain healthy and that they're able to perform at their peak performance level. If things go wrong, patients can be recovered, treated, and then put back in the system right.

The MHS has one mission: To care for our service members.

Question: Talk about how you work with the chairman, the Joint Staff, the combatant commanders, the service surgeons general, and the assistant secretary of defense for health affairs.

Andrus: My role is to collaborate with them. I sit at the table. What's important to note is that at that table, all voices should be equal. And the joint voice at that table is particularly unique because it brings a perspective looking across the entire health system. The service surgeons general bring incredibly valuable, organized voices to the table that are service-specific, so we understand the service equities. I have my own voice from an operational side and then from a joint side, we try to align those activities to what's required. I represent the mission.

My role with Health Affairs is to make sure that we're collaborative. Dr. Stephen Ferrara (acting assistant secretary of defense for health affairs) has a very significant role as the resource manager for the defense health program funding. The chairman's voice also comes across to the secretary (of defense) in terms of resourcing as well. So, you've got two voices that are coming from two different points in the organization. It’s a unit. I have an independent voice representing the chairman and representing, most importantly, the joint force. That collaboration is critical to make sure that we are aligned.

Question: Describe the Joint Staff Surgeon’s role in navigating changes in the MHS.

Andrus: The MHS itself has gone from a service-centric entity to a much more joint-oriented entity. You have to know what you're doing and how all the parts work together. You have to know how to engage in the system. People don't realize how large the MHS is. About a year ago, I talked to the chairman about some of the core challenges in the MHS -- what were some gaps, perhaps in our preparedness to do the things we might be asked to do, right from an operational perspective.

When I arrived, the Defense Health Agency was only a year into having administrative authority, direction control over the MTFs (military hospitals and clinics), which was hard to overestimate how much tectonic change that meant for the system. We asked, “What are the impacts of that change?”

There was a change in the structure and now in new realignment of responsibilities and authorities. We analyzed if the resources aligned to those new responsibilities, asking, “What's at the root of some of the challenges that we're trying to overcome?”

Question: What are the next steps to address challenges with the MHS?

Andrus: We have been working the capability portfolio management review now for coming up on a year, and we've had some incredible insights that have come out of it —not just from trying to solve the surface problem but understanding what's underlying and really getting after the systemic issues that need to be resolved to move forward.

We're going to ask for permission to go back and reassess our joint capability areas as a foundational element to build and define capability portfolios across the entire military medical mission. We have to remember the mission is taking care of service members. The mission is measured by the combat effectiveness of the units we support. We have to broaden that definition to include our partners that can provide the services with medics that are trained, equipped, and ready to go.

Question: What do you envision for the future of the MHS?

Andrus: We’re at a point in time right now where we have an opportunity to really advance the MHS. If somebody asks me, “What's the one thing that we should do?” I say, “To improve the MHS.” We can be too focused on differences. We need to be more focused on where there’s alignment and build on that alignment. Each leader needs to recommit themselves to leaning in and working together. That means that we need to understand the mission from the same sight picture, and we need to lean into that mission and allow individual opinions, desires, and preferences to go by the wayside as we figure out the most effective way to get the mission done: To support the warfighter.

Andrus leaves behind a legacy of dedication to warfighter and family health, a core focus on resiliency of the joint force, and an encouragement to continue what the MHS strives for: working together to improve the health of all those entrusted to its care.
