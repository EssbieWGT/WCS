“We are all focused on a mission that cuts across every sector represented: Delivering smarter, integrated, and data-driven health care for service members, veterans, and their families,” he said.
“This is the backbone of a connected system that allows service members’ medical history to follow them from basic training to the battlefield and ultimately into the VA EHR system,” Ferrara said.
It is also how we ensure that we are supporting the warfighter beyond the battlefield, providing continuity of care that spans service and system boundaries,” said Ferrara.
And that is the path we are walking together to support the warfighter, sustain our skills, and strengthen the healthcare chain that unites military, veteran, and civilian care.”","Interoperability is one of the biggest challenges facing service members and veterans in their lifelong health care experience, Dr. Stephen Ferrara, Acting Assistant Secretary of Defense for Health Affairs, said recently to a group of military and veteran healthcare leaders.

To address this, he said the Department of Defense’s ongoing collaboration with Department of Veterans Affairs, Department of Health and Human Services, and other federal partners remains vital to improving continuity of care for service members.

“We are all focused on a mission that cuts across every sector represented: Delivering smarter, integrated, and data-driven health care for service members, veterans, and their families,” he said.

“This is more than a technical conversation—it’s an operational imperative,” he continued. “The nature of warfare is changing. So is the nature of care. From polytrauma and blast injuries to long-term behavioral health challenges and environmental exposure risks, the people we serve need a healthcare system that is resilient, proactive, and agile enough to adapt in real time.”

Addressing the complexities of the MHS, Ferrara stressed, “Our purpose remains constant: To deliver world-class, operationally relevant, and future-ready health care—not just in hospitals and clinics, but on ships, in operational medical units across combat zones, and increasingly in the digital space.”

He talked about the urgency of having “a single, secure electronic health record across all military treatment facilities—one that spans operational, deployed, and garrison environments.”

In 2024, DOD completed a seven-year, multi-billion dollar project to deploy MHS GENESIS at all military hospitals and clinics as the DOD’s single electronic health record. “This is the backbone of a connected system that allows service members’ medical history to follow them from basic training to the battlefield and ultimately into the VA EHR system,” Ferrara said.

MHS GENESIS will ultimately provide a seamless healthcare experience for service members moving from the MHS to the VA by providing “access to their complete clinical history, from battlefield treatment notes to neuroimaging records, and mental health encounters.”

“That is not just a matter of convenience; it is the difference between proactive, effective care and fragmented follow-up. It is also how we ensure that we are supporting the warfighter beyond the battlefield, providing continuity of care that spans service and system boundaries,” said Ferrara.

Ferrara noted three areas of focus to modernize the EHR experience:

• Artificial intelligence-powered decision support tools to identify early signs of posttraumatic stress disorder, traumatic brain injuries, and suicide risk

• Remote monitoring systems for chronic disease and post-operative care

• Expanded virtual health capabilities that allow surgical consultations from deployed hospital units and behavioral health visits from remote duty stations

He said with these capabilities, it would allow the MHS to “deliver care in what is being called the ‘fourth space’ of health care—beyond hospitals, clinics, and home. In this new digital space, information moves faster than geography, connecting care teams and patients across domains, countries, and conflict zones.”

Ferrara said that digital integration is crucial “so we can help our warfighters even when they are in the farthest corners of the globe. Integration helps us maintain clinical currency, train the next generation of military medical professionals, and support real-time care in dynamic environments.”

Taking advantage of the “vast and growing health data available” is vital, he said, by “not just documenting what has happened, but to anticipate what is next. We are now moving from health data collection to data-informed readiness.”

Ferrara discussed the integration of wearable technology to assess “warfighter performance and injury risk,” as an example of how the MHS is leveraging this health data for “real-time tracking of sleep patterns, heart rate variability, and exertion, combined with clinical records, to help flag early indicators of musculoskeletal injury or psychological stress.”

He described how the MHS is leveraging machine-language models to identify potential patterns that may exist and tie into common events experienced by service members, which was previously impossible, such as the individual longitudinal exposure record.

“ILER is a critical tool allowing clinicians to access personalized exposure histories at the time of care, while simultaneously supporting population-level research on long-term outcomes like cancer or neurodegenerative disease,” said Ferrara.

“The point here is not simply about having data—it’s about building systems that translate data quickly into insight and action, delivering better outcomes at the point of care and across the care continuum.”

He added, “This is how we support the warfighter not just during deployment, but across a lifetime, and how we strengthen our healthcare chain with evidence-based policy, clinical guidance, and surveillance systems that endure.”

Collaborating for the Future

He advocated for the need to create partnerships with government, academia, and domestic and foreign partners to ensure future readiness and healthcare innovation.

“None of this work can succeed in silos. Our public-private partnerships are essential—not just for developing new tools, but for testing, scaling, and governing them responsibly,” said Ferrara. “We are deeply engaged with the VA, Health and Human Services, and other federal partners to create interoperable platforms and to help ensure continuity of care across the life of a service member.”

He also noted collaborations with NATO, allied medical forces, and humanitarian organizations “support interoperability during coalition operations and disaster response.”

“Domestically, we rely on civilian trauma partnerships, like the military-civilian partnership for trauma readiness, to certify that our providers remain trained in high-acuity, high-volume trauma care. These partnerships directly improve our operational response to mass casualty incidents and combat situations.”

He emphasized the need for the MHS to be “laser focused on thinking about fighting the next war, not the last war.”

“The mission of the MHS is clear,” he continued, “Deliver a truly integrated, digitally enabled, globally partnered system of readiness and care.”

“It is a future in which data is no longer a barrier, but a bridge. That is the promise of our work. And that is the path we are walking together to support the warfighter, sustain our skills, and strengthen the healthcare chain that unites military, veteran, and civilian care.”",https://d1ldvf68ux039x.cloudfront.net/thumbs/photos/2309/8001488/1000w_q95.jpg,N,0.0,2025-06-02 13:56:20.287943

The half-day session offered newcomers an introduction to military life through presentations on TRICARE, military terminology, leave and earnings statements, and personal finance. The event also included a panel of “seasoned spouses,” who shared insights and personal stories from years of navigating the unique challenges of military life.

“This is a great opportunity to come together to support one another,” said U.S. Air Force Lt. Col. Preston Goodrich, 802nd Force Support Squadron commander. “Sharing information and knowledge, making connections—these things can lead to great outcomes.”

Wendy Council, a work-life specialist at JBSA’s M&FRC, spoke on the panel and reflected on how much support from fellow spouses meant to her early on in her marriage to a servicemember.

“We got married—I was 19—so it was my first time away from home,” Council said. “I was clinging to something that was what I saw as wiser. I was looking to the other spouses who had been through it. They knew more about it. I didn’t have a mom, mother-in-law, no one else around.”

For Brianna Kerber, who attended Heart Link for the first time, the event demonstrated how engaged the M&FRC staff are in supporting spouses.

“It was nice to know that the Readiness Center staff are getting involved with other programs. It’s good to make connections and do all the networking.”

The session also addressed financial readiness. Richard Gomez, M&FRC community readiness consultant—personal finance, explained how small administrative oversights on the LES can cost families significant amounts over time.

“We find service members still marked as single on their LES even though they’re married with kids,” Gomez said. “That’s money lost every month. Fixing that one line can mean hundreds of dollars back in your pocket.”

Although the funds can often be recovered later—such as during tax season—Gomez stressed the importance of making timely corrections to ensure families receive their full entitled monthly pay.

Heart Link is just one of many programs offered through the JBSA M&FRC, which supports active-duty service members, National Guard personnel, Reserve forces, retirees, surviving spouses, and DOD civilians. As part of the centers, operated by the 502nd Air Base Wing and the 802nd Force Support Squadron, provide one-on-one consultations, workshops, and briefings covering everything from employment and relocation to deployment support, volunteer opportunities, and transition assistance.

The goal of the program is to strengthen military families by connecting them with the resources, people, and knowledge they need to thrive.

People who can get affordable health coverage through their employers don't qualify for the PTC, nor do individuals who are eligible for Medicare, Tricare, Medicaid or other federal health insurance programs.
Modified AGI for this purpose is your AGI plus tax-free interest, nontaxable Social Security benefits and tax-exempt foreign earned income.
The PTC is estimated when you go on the marketplace to buy health insurance.
Most people who qualify for the PTC will generally elect to have it paid in advance directly to the health insurance company to lower their monthly health insurance premiums.","The health premium tax credit (PTC) is almost 13 years old. Thanks to Obamacare, eligible individuals who otherwise can’t get affordable coverage through their employers can purchase coverage from the marketplace and qualify for the PTC to reduce their monthly premiums. People who can get affordable health coverage through their employers don't qualify for the PTC, nor do individuals who are eligible for Medicare, Tricare, Medicaid or other federal health insurance programs.

Temporary PTC easings are ending

Prior to 2021, the PTC was available only to people with modified adjusted gross incomes (AGI) ranging from 100% to 400% of the federal poverty guidelines, who bought insurance through the marketplace, such as on healthcare.gov, and who met certain other rules. Modified AGI for this purpose is your AGI plus tax-free interest, nontaxable Social Security benefits and tax-exempt foreign earned income.

During the height of the COVID-19 pandemic, federal lawmakers enhanced the PTC for 2021 and 2022, letting more people qualify for the subsidy. Congress also increased the credit amount for many qualifying individuals. Lawmakers later renewed these enhancements, but made them temporary through 2025.

For 2025, individuals with modified AGI over 400% of the federal federal poverty level will qualify for the PTC to the extent that the cost of the benchmark silver plan on the marketplace exceeds 8.5% of their income.

However, beginning in 2026, the rules revert to those that were in place for pre-2021 years, so that only individuals with modified AGI between 100% and 400% of the poverty level will get PTCs. That means that fewer people will qualify for the PTC. Also, the credit amounts for most everyone else who would still qualify for PTCs will be much lower than before, meaning individuals would be paying higher premiums for health insurance.

This will begin to impact people seeking marketplace coverage for 2026 on healthcare.gov later this fall, unless Congress acts to extend the PTC easings. And the impact will continue to be felt for each year thereafter. Letting the PTC enhancements lapse could eventually lead to 3.7 million people losing heath insurance each years because they can't afford the monthly premiums. And this is a conservative figure.

Extending the PTC easings isn't a goal of President Trump or of most congressional Republicans. Even while GOP lawmakers in Washington, D.C., are hard at work on a tax deal to extend expiring provisions in the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act and to provide additional tax relief, there is silence on the PTC. The House-passed ""One Big Beautiful"" bill doesn't extend the easings. And though we expect that Senate Republicans will make some changes to the House package, adding PTC relief isn't in the forecast. It's possible that Congress could address PTC relief later on this year in a different tax bill, but that appears to be a longshot.

How does the premium tax credit work?

The PTC is estimated when you go on the marketplace to buy health insurance. The estimated credit for 2026 will be based on your expected 2026 income. To figure this out, you would begin with your 2024 modified AGI and add or substract any expected income changes that you anticipate having for 2026. The lower your modified AGI, the bigger the credit.

Most people who qualify for the PTC will generally elect to have it paid in advance directly to the health insurance company to lower their monthly health insurance premiums. If you opt for this, you must file a federal tax return, even though your income may be below the filing threshold or you expect a refund. You would use IRS Form 8962 to compute the PTC amount, list any advance payments made to the insurer (which you would find on the Form 1095-A that you receive from the health insurance marketplace), and reconcile the two figures. If your PTC exceeds the advance payments, then you can claim the excess PTC on your Form 1040. If the PTC is less than the advances, most people would need to repay part or all of the excess.

Beware of an IRS audit red flag

Erroneous reporting of the PTC on your Form 1040 is an easy red flag for the IRS. Its computers flag filed tax returns showing modified AGIs that exceed the limit to take the PTC. Also, the IRS receives Form 1095-A from the health insurance marketplace that shows which taxpayers have selected to have their PTC paid in advance to reduce monthly premiums, and the amounts of those advance payments. So before you file your Form 1040, double-check that you qualify for the PTC and that you accurately report it.

Also, if you are currently enrolled in marketplace coverage, let the marketplace know of any changes that could affect your 2025 PTC amount. For example, if your lost your job and report lower income, the marketplace will increase the subsidy amount for future months, thus putting more money into your pocket. The exchange will also decrease the subsidy if you report higher income, for example, maybe you sold investment property or you found a new job. Notifying the marketplace now can mitigate surprises when you file your Form 1040 next year.",https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/f9yGJJZ8SdbaYqa4zAYsr8.jpg,N,0.0,2025-06-02 09:56:24.742690

SSA Speaks Clearly: What Is the Compassionate Allowances Program

The Compassionate Allowances program allows for the rapid identification of diseases and medical conditions that clearly meet the disability criteria established by SSA. These conditions include certain types of cancer, adult brain disorders, and rare diseases that affect children.

Due to the severity of these conditions, applications can be approved based solely on medical confirmation of the diagnosis. All of this, without the need for additional documentation.

Identification of Diseases and Advanced Technology

SSA uses advanced technology, such as electronic medical records and computerized assessments, to identify possible cases that qualify for the CAL program. This technology allows for a faster and more accurate evaluation of applications, significantly reducing the waiting time for applicants.

The Compassionate Allowances program is crucial for SSA, since it allows them to speed up the disability determination process for people with the most severe conditions. To date, more than one million people with severe disabilities have been approved through this expedited process. Currently, the program includes a total of 287 conditions.

Recent Updates

Recently, SSA has added nine new conditions to the CAL program and has reviewed two existing conditions. Among the new conditions are Bainbridge-Ropers syndrome, Costello syndrome, and medullary renal carcinoma.

These updates reflect SSA's ongoing commitment to improve and expand the program. The Compassionate Allowances program is an essential tool for SSA to provide rapid assistance to people with serious illnesses.

For more than a century, it has been a benchmark for consumers across the country. However, in recent years, it has faced serious financial problems that have affected its operations.

This situation has led the company to make the difficult decision to close some of its large stores in different regions of the country. These closures are part of a restructuring plan designed to try to regain stability and competitiveness. Nevertheless, the process is still underway and it is expected to take some time before JC Penney can fully reestablish itself in the market.

Scheduled Closures to Optimize Resources

According to a USA Today publication, the first round of closures will take effect before May 25. The company is seeking to optimize its resources and adapt to a changing market. ""We don't have plans to significantly reduce our number of stores, but we expect a handful of stores to close by midyear,"" a JC Penney spokesperson said.

The decision to close these locations is not made lightly. ""Closing a store is never easy, but sometimes it happens due to lease expirations, market changes, or other reasons,"" the source added.

List of Stores Affected by the Closure

Among the stores that will cease operations soon are several located in different states:

The closure of these stores is only the beginning of a process that aims to help the American chain improve its financial situation and efficiency for the future. JC Penney still faces a complicated path to fully restructure and regain its position in the competitive American retail market.

Most Americans believe their healthcare is private, and the majority prefers it that way. Gallup polling shows more Americans favor a system based on private insurance rather than government-run healthcare.

But here’s a surprising reality: 91% of Americans receive government-subsidized healthcare.

Unless you’re among the uninsured or the few who receive no subsidies, government dollars are helping pay your medical bills — whether your insurance comes from an employer, a privately managed care organization or the online marketplace.

Now, as lawmakers face mounting budget pressures, those subsidies (and your coverage) could be at risk. If the government scales back its healthcare spending, your medical costs could skyrocket.

Here’s a closer look at the five ways the U.S. government funds healthcare. If you have health insurance, you’re almost certainly benefiting from one of them:

Medicare, the government-run healthcare program for those 65 and older, covers 67 million Americans at a cost of more than $1 trillion annually. Approximately half of enrollees are covered through the traditional fee-for-service plan and the other half in privately managed Medicare Advantage plans.

Medicaid and CHIP provide health coverage for around 80 million low-income and disabled Americans, including tens of millions of children. Even though 41 states have turned over their Medicaid programs over to privately managed care organizations, the cost remains public. Total Medicaid spending is $900 billion annually — the federal government pays 70% with states footing the rest.

The online healthcare marketplace is for Americans whose employer doesn’t provide medical coverage or who are self-employed. This Affordable Care Act program offers federal subsidies to 92% of its 23 million enrollees, which help lower the cost of premiums and, for many, subsidize their out-of-pocket expenses. The Congressional Budget Office projects that a permanent extension of these subsidies, which are scheduled to end this year, would cost $383 billion over the next 10 years.

Veterans and military families also benefit from government healthcare through TRICARE and VA Care, programs covering roughly 16 million individuals at a combined cost of $148 billion for the federal government annually.

Employer-sponsored health insurance comes with a significant, yet often overlooked, government subsidy. For nearly 165 million American workers and their families, U.S. companies pay the majority of their health insurance premiums. However, those dollars are excluded from employees’ taxable income. This tax break, which originated during World War II and was formally codified in the 1950s, subsidizes workers at an annual government cost of approximately $300 billion. For a typical family of four, this translates into approximately $8,000 per year of added take-home pay.

With 91% of Americans receiving some form of government healthcare assistance, the idea that U.S. healthcare is predominantly “private” is an illusion.

Now, as the new administration searches for ways to rein in the growing federal deficit, all five of these programs (collectively funding healthcare for 9 in 10 Americans) will be in the crosshairs.

Twelve percent of the federal budget already goes toward debt interest payments, and this share is expected to rise sharply. Many of the bonds used to finance existing debt were issued back when interest rates were much lower. As those bonds mature and are refinanced at today’s higher rates, federal interest payments are projected to double within the next decade, according to the Congressional Budget Office.

With deficits mounting and borrowing costs soaring, most economists agree this trajectory is unsustainable. Lawmakers will eventually need to rein in spending, and healthcare subsidies will almost certainly be among the first targets. Policy experts predict Medicaid, which the House has already proposed cutting by $880 billion over the next decade, and ACA subsidies for out-of-pocket costs will likely be the first on the chopping block. But given the CBO’s projections, these cuts won’t be the last.

A Better Way: Three Solutions To Lower Healthcare Costs Without Cuts

Cutting some or all of these healthcare subsidies may seem like the simplest way to reduce the deficit. In reality, it merely shifts costs elsewhere, making medical care more expensive for everyone and increasing future government spending. Here’s why:

Eliminating subsidies doesn’t eliminate the need for care. Under the Emergency Medical Treatment and Labor Act (EMTALA), hospitals must treat emergency patients regardless of their ability to pay. When millions lose insurance, more turn to ERs for medical care they can’t afford. The cost of that uncompensated care doesn’t vanish. It gets passed on to state governments, hospitals and privately insured patients through higher taxes, inflated hospital bills and rising insurance premiums.

Delaying care drives up long-term costs. People who can’t afford doctor visits skip preventive care, screenings and early treatments. Manageable conditions like high blood pressure and diabetes then spiral into costly, life-threatening complications including heart attacks, strokes and kidney failures, which ultimately increase government spending.

The solution isn’t cutting coverage. It’s fixing the root causes of high healthcare costs. Here are three ways to achieve this:

1. Address The Obesity Epidemic

Obesity is a leading driver of diabetes, heart disease, stroke and breast cancer, which kill millions of Americans and cost the U.S. healthcare system hundreds of billions annually. Congress can take two immediate steps to reverse this crisis:

Tax high-calorie, highly processed foods and use the revenue to subsidize healthier options, making nutritious food more affordable for all Americans.

Cap the price of GLP-1 weight-loss medications (such as Ozempic and Wegovy) to match prices in peer nations, ensuring these highly effective treatments are accessible.

2. Enhance Chronic Disease Management With Technology

In every other industry, broad adoption of generative AI technology is already increasing quality while reducing costs. Healthcare could do the same by applying generative AI to more effectively manage chronic disease. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, improved control of these lifelong conditions could cut the frequency of heart attacks, strokes, kidney failures and cancers by up to 50%.

With swift and reasonable Food and Drug Administration approval, generative AI and wearable monitors would revolutionize how these conditions are managed, providing real-time updates on patient health and identifying when medications need adjustment. Instead of waiting months for their next in-office visit, patients with chronic diseases would receive continuous monitoring, preventing costly and life-threatening complications. Rather than restricting AI’s role in healthcare, Congress can streamline the FDA’s approval process and allocate National Institutes of Health funding to accelerate these advancements.

3. Reform Healthcare Payment Models

Under today’s fee-for-service system, doctors and hospitals are paid based on the how often they see patients for the same problem and the number of procedures performed. This approach rewards the volume of care, not the best and most effective treatments. A better alternative is a pay-for-value model like capitation, in which providers do best financially when they help keep patients healthy. To encourage participation, Congress should fund pilot programs and create financial incentives for insurers, doctors and hospitals willing to transition to this system. By aligning financial incentives with long-term health, this model would encourage doctors to prioritize prevention and effective chronic disease control, ultimately lowering medical costs by improving overall health.

The Time For Change Is Now

If Congress slashes healthcare subsidies this year, restoring them will be nearly impossible. Once the cuts take effect, the financial and political pressures driving them will only intensify, making reversal unlikely.

The voices shaping this debate can’t come solely from industry lobbyists. Elected officials need to hear from the 91% of Americans who rely on government healthcare assistance for some or all of their medical coverage. Now is the time to speak up.",https://secure.gravatar.com/blavatar/62f949303b5bc4161fc4f42e5e97793781b741a4c0a477fb57161c0a633596ae?s=200&ts=1748840190,N,0.0,2025-06-02 00:56:31.774669

It’s important to note that Medicare and Social Security are two independent senior programs with different eligibility rules.
So, is it unfair that you must pay for Medicare Part B before you are collecting Social Security?","By Russell Gloor, National Social Security Advisor at the AMAC Foundation, the non-profit arm of the Association of Mature American Citizens

Dear Rusty: I’m a retired Navy veteran who is going to be turning 65 years old this year. My question is concerning mandatory Medicare sign-up requirements. Why do I have to sign up for Medicare coverage at 65 when I can’t start collecting full Social Security benefits until I turn 67? My Social Security benefits will not pay for my mandatory Medicare because I can’t start collecting full Social Security benefits until I’m 67!

I currently pay for Tricare and utilize my local Veterans Administration medical facilities and referrals for my healthcare. With me turning 65 and having to wait until I’m 67 for my full Social Security benefits, it just seems unfair that I’ll have to pay out of pocket Medicare monthly expenses for two years! Is there any way to avoid this unfair penalty? Signed: Retired Navy Vet

Dear Retired Navy Vet: First, I want to thank you for your military service to our country. Please know that here at the AMAC Foundation we care a lot about our veterans, and you may find the “For Veterans” section of our Foundation website interesting (www.amacfoundation.org).

Regarding your question, you should be aware that enrolling in Medicare is not mandatory, but there are consequences if you do not enroll when you become eligible (normally at age 65). For one thing, if you are a retired veteran on military TriCare, you will lose your TriCare benefits if you don’t enroll in Medicare when you are eligible (TriCare requires that you enroll in Medicare when eligible). And, since you are not yet collecting Social Security, you will be required to separately pay the Medicare Part B premium directly to Medicare (they will bill you when you enroll in Medicare). Another potential consequence is that if you do not enroll in Medicare Part B when you are first eligible, you may incur a lifetime late enrollment penalty for enrolling in Part B later.

Something else to keep in mind is that there are two “parts” to Medicare – Part A (which is coverage for inpatient hospitalization services), and Part B, which is coverage for outpatient healthcare services (doctors, medical tests, etc.). Medicare Part A is free to you, but there is a premium for Medicare Part B ($185/month for 2025). Note that you will need to pay a Part B premium as long as you are enrolled in Medicare Part B (it doesn’t go away after you are collecting Social Security, but it is taken from your Social Security payment). And there is no way for you to avoid the Part B premium after enrolling, and enrolling in Part B is necessary for you to continue your military TriCare-for-life benefits. Note that Medicare Part A and Part B do not include prescription drug coverage, but your TriCare coverage usually does.

It’s important to note that Medicare and Social Security are two independent senior programs with different eligibility rules. As you may know, you can collect early (reduced) Social Security at age 65 (and have your Medicare Part B premium deducted from your SS payment). But you would be collecting Social Security early and, in addition to a reduced benefit, you would also be subject to Social Security’s annual earnings test if you are still working. The SS earnings test limits how much you can earn before some of your SS benefits are taken away (if you exceed the earning limit prior to your full retirement age).

So, is it unfair that you must pay for Medicare Part B before you are collecting Social Security? Well, I think not, because the two programs are completely independent benefits (the Social Security Administration merely administers Medicare payments as a convenience). Remember your Medicare Part A is free, but you must pay a premium for Part B, and you must take both to retain your military TriCare-for-Life benefits. You can visit this site to see how to pay your Medicare premiums until it is later deducted from your Social Security payment: www.medicare.gov/basics/costs/pay-premiums/online-bill-pay.

Once again, thank you for your service to our country.",https://jocoreport.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Social-Security-Ask-Rusty-10-04-18CP.jpg,N,0.0,2025-06-01 16:56:24.877660

For more information and to consult the complete payment calendar, visit the official Social Security Administration website at ssa.gov.","Millions of beneficiaries of the Supplemental Security Income (SSI) program in the United States have noticed that the payment for June 2025 is already available in their accounts as of yesterday, May 30. This early deposit has caused confusion among many, who are wondering if it's a mistake or if they'll receive an additional payment.

The Social Security Administration (SSA) has confirmed that it's not a mistake and that there won't be a second payment on June 1. The reason for this early deposit is due to a particularity of the calendar: today, June 1, is Sunday.

The SSA Doesn't Want Confusion: This Is Why You Don't Receive SSI in the United States Today

According to SSA policies, when the usual payment date falls on a weekend or holiday, the deposit is made on the previous business day. That's why the June payment was made on Friday, May 30.

This calendar adjustment can cause confusion, since beneficiaries receive two payments in May and none in June. However, it's a common practice by the SSA to ensure that beneficiaries receive their funds on time. Similar situations will occur in other months of the year, such as in September and January 2026, when payments will be advanced due to holidays or weekends.

The SSA Recommends Beneficiaries Review Their Payment Calendar

It's important to note that this early deposit doesn't mean an additional payment or affect the total annual amount that beneficiaries receive. SSI payments are calculated monthly and any additional income can influence the amount received. For example, in 2025, the maximum monthly SSI benefit is $967 for individuals and $1,450 for couples.

To avoid confusion, the SSA recommends that beneficiaries review their payment calendar and plan their finances accordingly. While it may seem like there's an ""extra"" payment in May, it's actually the one corresponding to June. Therefore, an additional deposit shouldn't be expected on June 1.

If You Want More Information, It's Very Easy

Backed by Donald Trump and introduced by Republicans in the House of Representatives, the initiative seeks to temporarily eliminate taxes on tips until 2028.

This measure would apply to professions with a history of receiving tips, such as waiters, bartenders, and hotel workers. It would also be subject to approval by the Treasury Department, which would determine the eligible occupations. In addition, only workers earning less than $160,000 per year would qualify for the benefit.

The Latest from the US Government and the SSA on Tips: Goodbye Taxes

It is estimated that workers could save an average of $1,800 per year, although those with lower wages would see an approximate savings of $200. However, the measure has faced criticism for its limited impact, since many workers who receive tips do not earn enough to benefit.

The proposal has caused mixed reactions in the United States. Some restaurant workers and their advocates have replied with little enthusiasm. They have expressed that they would prefer increases in base wages over the elimination of taxes on tips.

This Is What Experts Say: Millions of Americans Paying Attention

Economic experts warn that eliminating taxes on tips could benefit a very small number of workers. According to Yale University, four million people, 3% of the workforce, fall into the category of tipped employees.

Of them, currently, 37% do not pay federal taxes because their income doesn't reach the annual minimum that would require them to file. In addition, it is warned that some could move into a higher income bracket.

They could lose other benefits such as the tax credit that currently helps workers and especially low-income families. If the measure is applied to payroll contributions, workers could end up with lower retirement benefits or health coverage.

The Measure Still Needs to Overcome More Debates in Congress

The proposal could also have a significant impact on the SSA. Reducing payroll taxes could affect the lifespan of Social Security and Medicare. According to SSA administrators, it is already expected to be insolvent in 2034.

Although the proposal to eliminate taxes on tips has caused anticipation and could benefit certain workers in the service sector, it has also raised concerns. Especially about its effectiveness, fairness, and fiscal sustainability. The measure still needs to overcome more debates in Congress before its possible implementation.",https://elcierredigital.com/filesedc/uploads/image/post/montaje-donald-trump-seguridad-social-y-muchos-billetes_1200_800.webp,N,0.0,2025-06-01 16:56:32.605873

Even so, Meghan Markle's figure doesn't seem to have received the desired acceptance from her and Prince Harry.","The death of Princess Diana in 1997 left a deep mark on her youngest son, Prince Harry, who was only twelve years old at the time. The Duke of Sussex has spoken openly about the pain of losing his mother and has expressed regret for not being able to introduce her to his wife. With that void in mind, Harry tried to have his aunts, Diana's sisters, see Meghan Markle as a continuation of his mother, appealing to supposed similarities between the two women.

The Difficult Path to Gaining Family Approval

In 2017, when Harry introduced Meghan to his family, he turned to his aunts Lady Sarah McCorquodale and Lady Jane Fellowes, as well as his uncle Charles Spencer. Harry believed that they could understand the relationship because both Meghan and Diana shared similar experiences and problems. However, the reality was very different and Diana's sisters did not agree with that comparison.

The writer Tom Bower, an expert on the British royal family, reveals that Harry ""assumed that Diana's family and friends would see a similarity between his mother and his fiancée."" The rejection was forceful, and his aunts told him that Meghan ""wouldn't fit into the royal family."" In addition, Uncle Charles Spencer advised Harry not to marry quickly, causing tensions and a bitter reaction.

The Parallels That Prince Harry Defended Until the End

Despite the lack of family support, Harry kept defending the parallels he saw between Meghan and his mother. In his docuseries ""Harry & Meghan,"" he stated: ""Many of Meghan's traits and behaviors remind me of my mother, she has the same compassion, empathy, and confidence; that warmth that characterizes her."" This emotional parallel sought to strengthen the relationship and pay tribute to Diana, although it was not well received by his aunts.

Despite the disagreements, Diana's siblings have remained present in the lives of Princes Harry and William. They have attended important family events, including their weddings, and keep ties with their nephews.

Lady Sarah, Lady Jane, and Charles Spencer were among the guests at Archie, Harry and Meghan's son's christening, in 2019. In addition, on what would have been Diana of Wales's 60th birthday, her siblings joined the princes at the unveiling of a statue at Kensington Palace in 2021. Charles Spencer has publicly defended Harry during his conflicts with the royal family.

Meghan Markle stated in an interview that meeting the aunts was ""a way to connect with a part of Diana through them and through Harry."" ""It's something incredibly special,"" the duchess added.

This past year has been especially difficult for her, all due to her battle with cancer. Despite her public responsibilities, she has faced this challenge with discretion and strength.

However, behind her public image and her responsibilities, there is a little-known family reality. Recently, a more intimate side of her family has come to light. Her brother, James Middleton, has spoken openly about his mental health issues and the essential support he has received from Kate and his other sister, Pippa.

Unwavering Support in the Middleton Family

James expressed gratitude to his sisters for being by his side during the most difficult times. ""I'm incredibly fortunate to have my two sisters, not just as siblings, but as friends. They've seen me at my best and at my lowest, and they've always been there when I've needed them,"" he confessed in an interview.

Affection and family unity are key in recovery and support. ""The love between siblings is something unique. You can't choose your siblings, but when it's strong, I think it's one of the most powerful bonds that exist."" This way, James showed the importance of those ties in the fight against mental health issues.

Kate and Pippa, James Middleton's Greatest Supports

Far from distancing themselves or judging, the Middleton sisters have been present throughout James's entire battle. Despite Kate's enormous responsibilities, which include having overcome cancer, she has always kept a close relationship with her brother. The emotional intelligence and expressiveness of Kate and Pippa made a difference for him.

""They've always been emotionally open, expressive, and in tune with the people around them, and I think being surrounded by that kind of emotional intelligence rubbed off on me."" Thus, James acknowledged the positive impact of that companionship.

Learning to See Vulnerability as Strength

James confessed that it wasn't always easy to express his emotions, especially during his lowest moments. ""Like many men, I found it difficult to express how I was feeling when I was at my lowest,"" he said.

However, the support and guidance of his two sisters helped him understand that vulnerability is not a weakness, but a sign of absolute strength. ""Having strong women around me who guided me with compassion and honesty helped me learn that vulnerability wasn't weakness, but strength,"" James concluded, grateful.

There is no doubt that this testimony from James Middleton highlights the importance of breaking down stigmas surrounding mental health, especially in environments where public image and social expectations often prevail.

Over the past decade, the TRICARE pharmacy benefit has undergone significant changes, particularly in the management and utilization of compound drugs. Compound drugs are customized formulations that combine 2 or more pharmaceutical ingredients to meet specific patient needs and can offer therapeutic alternatives when standard US Food and Drug Administration–approved medications are ineffective. However, concerns regarding the safety, clinical effectiveness, and rising costs have necessitated increased oversight. Between 2013 and 2015, TRICARE experienced a drastic surge in compound drug expenditures, escalating from 4% of total pharmacy outpatient drug costs to 13% (more than $1.6 billion), despite representing only 0.4% of total outpatient prescription volume. This rapid increase highlighted the need for stricter controls to manage spending and ensure appropriate utilization. In response, the Defense Health Agency implemented a compound drug screening process in 2015, applying utilization management tools such as quantity limits, prior authorization, and step therapy. These measures aim to balance cost containment with maintaining access to clinically necessary compounded medications. This article provides a comprehensive review of the evolution of compound drugs within the TRICARE pharmacy benefit, examining safety concerns, spending trends, and management strategies.

Plain language summary

This article examines how the TRICARE pharmacy benefit addresses the challenges of compounded drug utilization. It highlights the need for cost controls, quality assurance, and compliance with regulations to ensure patient safety. This article aims to provide an overview of the evolution of compounded drugs within the TRICARE pharmacy benefit over the past decade, examine safety, spending, and utilization trends associated with compounded drugs, and discuss the management strategies implemented to address these changes.

Implications for managed care pharmacy

The utilization and management of compounded drugs in managed care pharmacy has great impacts on cost control, regulatory compliance, and patient safety. Enhanced utilization reviews are needed to address rising costs and are essential in ensuring safe and effective compounded drug use.

Over the last decade, the TRICARE pharmacy benefit has evolved significantly, particularly in the management and utilization of compounded drugs. Compounded drugs are customized formulations that combine 2 or more pharmaceutical ingredients, which may include multiple active pharmaceutical ingredients, or an active drug mixed with an appropriate vehicle or diluent for administration. They are often used when standard US Food and Drug Administration (FDA)–approved medications inadequately address the patient’s specific needs (eg, clonidine suspension for a pediatric patient). However, compounded drugs may often lack quality control measures required in current good manufacturing practice (CGMP) regulated by the FDA, raising concerns about potential contamination or alteration, which can jeopardize patient safety and even lead to severe consequences, including injury or death. 1 , 2 Clinical study requirements for compounded drugs are often less stringent than those for FDA-approved drugs. This article aims to provide an overview of the evolution of compounded drugs within the TRICARE pharmacy benefit over the past decade, examine safety, spending, and utilization trends associated with compounded drugs, and discuss the management strategies implemented to address these changes.

As of the end of 2023, the TRICARE health plan covered 9.6 million eligible beneficiaries, including active-duty service members, retirees, and their families. The Department of Defense (DoD) manages a 4-tier formulary system, categorizing medications into formulary generics, formulary brands, nonformulary, and noncovered tiers. This tier structure applies to standard medications and compounded drugs, ensuring that all pharmaceuticals adhere to the same categorization and benefit design rules. TRICARE beneficiaries have multiple avenues for obtaining prescribed medications, including approximately 700 military medical treatment facilities, a dedicated mail-order pharmacy, and roughly 42,000 retail network pharmacies. 3 Compounded drugs are subject to utilization management tools such as quantity limits, prior authorization (PA) requirements, and step therapy protocols. These tools are implemented to promote cost-effective prescribing practices, safeguard patient safety, and optimize health care resources.

In 2010, compounded drugs constituted a mere 0.25% of all TRICARE outpatient prescription drug volume by count of prescriptions, representing approximately $23 million or 0.11% of pharmacy outpatient drug expenditure. However, in subsequent years, there was a notable surge in the expenditures associated with compounded drugs, marking a significant shift in the financial landscape of pharmaceutical care within the Military Health System (MHS). By 2015, compounded drugs represented a slight increase to 0.4% of all TRICARE outpatient prescription drug volume but accounted for more than $1.6 billion, making up 13% of pharmacy outpatient drug costs. 3 The drastic increase in expenditure associated with compounded drugs between 2010 and 2015, such as bulk powders and creams and ointments used in custom formulations for pain management (eg, lidocaine, diclofenac), hormone replacement therapy (eg, progesterone, testosterone), and dermatological treatments (eg, fluocinonide), to name a few, highlighted the need for further review and implement measures to control spending within the TRICARE pharmacy benefit program. The sudden increase in compounded costs, despite compounded drugs maintaining similar percentages of outpatient prescription drug volume, prompted the potential issue of overutilization, inappropriate prescribing practices, or inflated pricing of compounded drugs. The rise in spending strained the financial resources allocated for pharmaceutical care within the MHS and underscored the importance of ensuring cost-effective and evidence-based use of medications.

Legitimate patient needs have partly driven the increase in use of compounded drugs but also have been exploited for fraudulent activities. Notably, TRICARE has been targeted in several high-profile fraud cases. Between 2013 and 2015, the Department of Justice estimated that compounded drugs contributed to $500 million in fraudulent payments, most of which targeted TRICARE. 4 To address the escalating costs and ensure patient safety at the recommendation of the DoD Pharmacy and Therapeutics Committee, the Director of Defense Health Agency (DHA) authorized the TRICARE pharmacy benefit contractor to implement a compounded drug screening process for TRICARE starting May 2015. Through this initiative, DHA established controls to screen all compounded drug ingredients against an exclusion list of noncovered ingredients including a select list of solid dose forms as well as bulk powders. This proactive measure aimed to curb unnecessary expenditures and ensure that the TRICARE pharmacy benefit covered only clinically appropriate and cost-effective compounded medications. In addition, by integrating compounded drugs into the tiered formulary system and implementing utilization management strategies, TRICARE endeavors to maintain equitable access to compounded medications while mitigating the financial ramifications associated with the surge in compounded drug expenditures. This comprehensive approach reflects the commitment of the TRICARE program to responsible resource allocation, evidence-based practice, and the delivery of high-quality pharmaceutical care to eligible beneficiaries across the military health care system.

Compounding Safety Concerns and Limitations

FDA’s Center for Drug Evaluation and Research reviews clinical study results provided by the drug manufacturer to ensure a drug product’s safety and efficacy before it is approved for marketing in the United States. This drug approval process also involves evaluating the methods, facilities, and controls used in manufacturing, processing, and packaging of the drug product via inspections or remote regulatory assessment to ensure they comply with CGMP regulations. Furthermore, before release for distribution, each lot or batch of drug product must pass all required testing and maintain a reserve sample twice the size necessary for all the required testing. 5 These rigorous requirements ensure the safety and efficacy of the drug and each lot and batch that is manufactured. The FDA may require manufacturers to perform postmarketing safety studies and clinical trials to assess potential risks.

According to the FDA, “[c]ompounding is generally a practice in which a licensed pharmacist, a licensed physician, or, in the case of an outsourcing facility, a person under the supervision of a licensed pharmacist, combines, mixes, or alters ingredients of a drug to create a medication tailored to the needs of an individual patient.” 6 However, compounded medications are not FDA approved. They are not subject to FDA independent review/testing for safety, efficacy, and quality before dispensing or distributing them. Unlike conventionally manufactured drug products approved for marketing in the United States, the CGMP regulations did not apply to compounded medications prior to 2013.

In 2012, numerous severe and some fatal fungal infections were diagnosed in seemingly unrelated patients across multiple states. Investigations into the cases later found one commonality: these patients had all received injections of compounded preservative-free methylprednisolone acetate, which was contaminated with Exserohilum rostratum and Aspergillus fumigatus. The injections were produced and distributed by the New England Compounding Center. 7

In response to this and other significant events, Congress amended the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act with Title I of the Drug Quality and Security Act. This amendment granted the FDA the authority to regulate and monitor the compounding process and established Section 503B of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, which created a new category of compounding pharmacy: 503B outsourcing facility. 8 The 503B outsourcing facilities are authorized to compound large batches of medications with or without prescription and distribute them for in-office or in-hospital use. These facilities are required to register with the FDA and pay an establishment fee annually. Additionally, they must report all compounded medications biannually, must collect and submit adverse event reports, and are subject to inspections. All 503B outsourcing facility processes must be validated according to CGMP regulations. Moreover, the compounded products must adhere to the United States Pharmacopeia (USP) standards. USP is an independent, scientific nonprofit organization that publishes standards for ensuring safe and quality medications, including compounded drugs.

The FDA defines 503A compounding pharmacies as those that prepare medications based on prescriptions tailored to individual patients. These pharmacies are regulated by state boards of pharmacy and must adhere to USP standards and other relevant guidelines. All DoD pharmacies are classified as 503A facilities. These establishments are exempt from CGMP requirements. Sites may be designated as 503A if the compounding is performed by a licensed pharmacist in a state-licensed or federal pharmacy (or by a licensed physician) only in response to or after receiving a valid prescription for an identified patient. Compounding in limited amounts in anticipation of receiving a prescription is also allowed, but bulk compounding is strictly prohibited. All compounding must comply with the corresponding USP standards. 9 Several significant changes and requirements were added to the new USP guidance on safe compounding found in USP Chapters 795 and 797, which went into effect on November 1, 2023. 10 , 11

One such change is the mandate to designate one or more individuals in the facility who will be responsible and accountable for the compounding operation and the personnel who will be performing these tasks. Both those who will be performing the actual compounding and those who have direct oversight of compounding will be required to be trained in compounding as well as the facility’s standard operating procedures and evaluated for competency initially and periodically (795—every 12 months; 797—compounder every 6 months and oversight staff every 12 months). Addressing personal hygiene and the garbing process, building and facilities requirements, cleaning and sanitizing minimum frequency, and equipment and components in 795 were not included prior to this update. In chapter 797, the personal hygiene and garbing were expanded and described in more detail, as was identifying the minimum frequency based on method (cleaning, disinfecting, and applying sporicidal/sterile isopropanol 70%) and specifying the type of material used for cleaning and disinfecting. Both chapters now require the preparation of a master formulation record for each compound that is made in the facility and a compounding record for each lot/batch of compounds made (797—only required in preparations for more than 1 patient or if using nonsterile components). The processes in establishing beyond use date have also had a major overhaul, utilizing water activity levels in 795 and determining the category of compounded sterile products in 797 to assign beyond use dates.

Although the updated USP standards are not as stringent as the CGMP regulations for traditional drug manufacturers monitored by FDA regulation, they help bridge the gap in patient safety when it comes to compounded drugs.

In recent years, the FDA has approved alternate dosage forms of commercially available pharmaceuticals that previously were only available to patients as a compounded agent. Alternate dosage forms approved by the FDA include solutions, suspensions, sprinkles, or oral disintegrating tablets, providing options to those patients who cannot take tablets or capsules. Through the rigorous approval process, which includes stringent clinical study requirements and manufacturers meeting CGMP, these FDA-approved alternate forms ensure safe and effective medication options for those who would otherwise need a compounded product.

Compound Management

As compound spending peaked at more than $1.6 billion by 2015, DHA implemented a strategy to reduce inappropriate prescribing and help curb costs. In March 2015, following the recommendation from the DoD Pharmacy and Therapeutics Committee, the DHA Director approved a new compound management solution for screening compounded drug ingredients. This solution, implemented in May 2015, helps ensure that all ingredients in compound drug claims are safe, effective, and covered under the TRICARE pharmacy benefit.

Pharmacies electronically submit all ingredients of a compound claim, and the system reviews them for coverage. If all ingredients are covered, the claim is approved for payment. However, the claim is rejected if even 1 ingredient is not covered. When a claim is denied, the pharmacist has several options:

(1)

The pharmacy may contact the prescriber to substitute the noncovered compounded ingredient with a covered FDA-approved alternative.

(2)

The pharmacy may input an override and accept a payment of $0 for the noncovered ingredient(s).

(3)

The prescriber may initiate a clinical PA review, which evaluates the clinical and cost-effectiveness of the compound.

As military treatment facilities (MTFs) transitioned to the electronic health record system MHS GENESIS, a compound standardization expert panel was established to oversee the use of nonsterile and sterile ophthalmic compounds within the system. This panel is the primary body for reviewing and approving compounded formulations mainly for MTF outpatient use (albeit these compounds may also be used in the inpatient setting) in MHS GENESIS and ensures real-time insurance adjudication. It is responsible for creating standardized recipes to ensure consistency across all MTFs. The panel consists of voting members from each branch of service, who meet monthly to conduct these reviews and maintain uniformity among the MTFs.

Tracking Compound Prescriptions

DHA monitors prescription volume and cost trends, including compound dispensing data. Prior to 2013, compound prescription data showed a dramatic rise in prescription costs. After the implementation of the DHA compounding solution, there was a dramatic decrease in spend with annual compounded medication spend at $49 million in 2016. In 2023, the annual spend for compounds is now $3 million (Figure 1).

The data analysis in Figure 2 reveals the percentage of compounded prescriptions to the overall number of covered prescriptions. In 2010, the percentage of compounds to all prescriptions was 0.25%, and there was a substantial increase in 2014 and 2015, peaking at 0.43% and 0.40%, respectively. The subsequent decrease in spend is likely due to fewer compounded prescriptions being filled, driven by several factors, including the availability of more FDA-approved alternate dosage forms, increased published research on compounded products, robust evidence supporting compounded medications, and reduced fraudulent activities. Evidence-based data on the effectiveness of compounded medications is crucial for ensuring patient safety and controlling costs. Unlike FDA-approved drugs, many compounded medications lack rigorous clinical trials to support their use, making it difficult to assess their true benefits and risks. The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists emphasizes this principle regarding compounded bioidentical hormone therapy. The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists recommends against the routine use of compounded hormone therapy because “available evidence does not support claims that compounded bioidentical hormone therapy is safer or more effective than FDA-approved hormone therapy.” This stance underscores the critical role of robust evidence in clinical decision-making. 12 In addition, during the rise in compound drug spending, compounders often published studies in pay-to-play journals that lacked scientific rigor to support unverified claims about the efficacy of compounded products. Despite this, the DHA approached the matter with an open mind, taking the time to research the claims made by compounders. This led to investigations and trials, such as those by Brutcher et al, 13 a randomized controlled trial, to determine the true effectiveness of compounded pain creams and to make informed decisions about their place in military treatment protocols. DoD (including DHA and the Defense Criminal Investigative Service) has worked with the US Department of Justice in criminal and civil actions. Several individuals were convicted of compound fraud offenses related to the DoD, with millions being reclaimed and returned to the government. 14 Although TRICARE was heavily impacted by compounded drug fraud, similar vulnerabilities exist in other health plans, including commercial insurers, Medicaid, and Medicare Part D. Fraudulent prescriptions and billing can increase costs if there are weak controls. However, TRICARE’s structure allows it to apply rules, like tighter drug lists and prior authorizations, to reduce spending. Some private and state-run plans may find it harder to apply the same measures, making cost reductions more challenging.

Conclusions

The evolution of compounded drugs within the Military Health System through the TRICARE pharmacy benefit underscores the necessity of balancing patient-specific care with strict safety standards. This commitment to patient-specific care is a testament to the DoD’s understanding of the unique needs of TRICARE beneficiaries. Although compounded drugs offer essential options for those whose needs cannot be met by FDA-approved medications, their lack of CGMP oversight presents unique challenges. Over the past decade, the DoD has taken significant steps to manage utilization, control spending, and ensure safety through its formulary and other management strategies. As the TRICARE program continues to evolve, ongoing oversight and adaptation will be crucial in safeguarding the health of its 9.6 million beneficiaries while maintaining access to necessary compoun-ded medications.

The American chain, known for its unique style, has managed to surpass giants like Apple, Amazon, Aldi, Costco, and Nintendo, according to the prestigious Axios Harris Poll 100 study.

A Remarkable Rise for Trader Joe’s

With an average score of 82.1 points, Trader Joe’s jumped from 13th place in 2024 to the top in 2025. This success represents not only a commercial triumph but also an emotional victory. Despite facing criticism over food safety and labor issues, the brand has built a loyal consumer base that actively recommends it.

Founded almost 60 years ago in Monrovia, California, Trader Joe’s has built its identity in a unique way: private label products, affordable prices, and an almost playful shopping environment. Its colorful aisles and alert employees are part of the appeal. In addition, the chain is committed to sustainability, eliminating unnecessary plastics and promoting reusable bags.

Overcoming Controversies with Authenticity

Although it hasn't been free from problems—such as product recalls and controversy over its resistance to unions—Trader Joe’s has managed to keep its reputation. Its strategy isn't based on expensive campaigns, but on the power of word of mouth and the support of a committed community.

Fast Company highlights how the chain has turned its customers into its best ambassadors. Spontaneous recommendations on social media, blogs, and videos have strengthened its image at a time when traditional advertising is losing influence.

Survey Details and Other Standout Brands

The Axios Harris Poll 100 survey was conducted in three phases between January and May of this year, gathering the opinions of more than 27,000 people. The study evaluated trust, ethics, growth, and social responsibility of the country's most visible brands. To enter the ""excellent"" category, brands had to score above 80 points.

Alongside Trader Joe’s, other retail chains like Costco (fifth place), Aldi, and Kroger also managed to stand out. In contrast, brands like X (formerly Twitter), Trump Organization, and Spirit Airlines occupied the last places. This reflects the significant difference between companies with a solid reputation and those still struggling to improve their public image.

This type of survey is key to measuring public perception and the trust that consumers place in brands. For companies, keeping their reputation is essential, since a positive image can translate into loyalty and sustained growth. On the other hand, a poor reputation can severely affect their sales and market positioning.",https://elcierredigital.com/filesedc/uploads/image/post/montaje-supermercados-trader-joes-costco-chico-sorprendido-senalando_1200_800.webp,N,0.0,2025-06-01 02:56:35.126357

Retail chains face fierce competition, where a single mistake can mean the loss of customers and a significant drop in sales. That's why offering consistently high-quality products and listening to consumers' demands has become a strategic priority to keep the public's trust and loyalty.

Costco is in the eye of the storm after making an unexpected change to one of its best-selling products: Kirkland Signature brand toilet paper. For years, this item has been recognized for its balance between quality and price, but lately consumers have noticed a decline in its quality. This situation has triggered a wave of criticism on social media and forums like Reddit, where users express their dissatisfaction.

Consumers' reaction

Although Costco enjoys great prestige among its members, the change in the quality of Kirkland toilet paper did not go unnoticed. On Reddit, several customers reported that the product has lost quality: ""The toilet paper is a disaster now, I'm about to throw away what's left of the package.""

Problems detected and doubts about the notice

Some customers also complained about the excess residue after use, stating: ""I feel like I'm sitting on a snowball."" This 36-roll package is sold online for $24.99, a price that now seems hardly justified for many users. Costco keeps a generous return policy, but they did not inform about this change in the product, which has increased frustration.

Costco memberships and benefits in 2025

For those considering joining Costco, the chain offers two membership levels this year. Gold Star costs $65 per year and gives access to all stores and basic services. Executive is priced at $130 per year, includes the benefits of Gold Star, a 2% annual rebate (up to $1,000), and exclusive promotions.

Why the membership is worth it

Although some see the initial cost as an expense, most members value the savings on products, gas, optical, and other services. Costco remains one of the most beloved wholesale options with a loyal base in the United States. Despite the recent controversy, their popularity remains intact.

Among the most visited stores, the headquarters in Issaquah, Washington stands out.

It's a big decision to make for your family! Applied behavior analysis (ABA) seeks to improve communication skills, introduce productive habits, and reduce harmful behaviors. Watch out for ABA providers who look to ""cure"" autism.

High quality ABA therapy does exist where the goal is not to “fix” children, make them appear “less autistic”, or change who they are. The goal is to help people learn all that they can so they can live to their potential while embracing their unique, individual personality traits. Here's our complete guide to start and end ABA therapy.

ABA looks different from other therapy settings. Typically, ABA therapy occurs multiple times a week and can take place in the home, community, or in a clinic setting. Depending on your child's needs, you might need to commit up to 40 hours a week.

ABA therapy can last for a few months to a few years. During that time, children and their families are committed to training and learning together. Therapy ideally ends when children meet their goals. Check out our complete guide for how to start and end ABA therapy.

ABA is usually covered by insurance if you have an autism diagnosis. Autism is typically the only diagnosis insurance will authorize for ABA services since its benefits have been researched extensively.

Always check with your specific insurance plan to confirm that ABA is covered for your child’s diagnoses and that the provider you are seeking care at is in-network.

His reputation as a visionary leader in the technology and electric car industries has taken a serious hit in recent times. While Tesla faces an economic crisis and a loss of trust, Musk has starred in a new controversial episode, this time directed at Laurene Powell Jobs, widow of Apple co-founder Steve Jobs.

Tesla at a Low Point and Musk Under Pressure

Musk's company, Tesla, is experiencing one of its worst moments in the United States: sales have dropped significantly and investors are showing distrust. Some Tesla car owners have even reacted by putting stickers on their vehicles apologizing for having bought the car ""before Elon went crazy."" The stock value has fallen, and the company is facing serious problems, with government contracts that could be lost.

Meanwhile, Musk seems more focused on his personal and political controversies than on saving his company. This decline has been accompanied by a drop in Musk's public image. What was once seen as brilliance and innovation is now criticized as erratic and confrontational, earning the dislike of many sectors of society.

The Confrontation with Steve Jobs's Widow

The most recent episode involving Musk came after the publication of an article in The Atlantic, owned by Laurene Powell Jobs, Steve Jobs's widow. Powell described Musk's time at the White House as a disaster. In response, Musk harshly attacked Laurene, stating that ""Steve would be very disappointed.""

But it didn't stop there. He used his new name on the social network X, ""Kekius Maximus,"" and an AI-caused image emulating a Roman centurion, launching a digital war full of sarcasm and mocking emojis. The situation became even more surreal when Elon Musk joked with users that Steve Jobs's ghost should ""haunt"" his widow from the grave.

All this happened on a platform that, since Elon Musk acquired it in 2022, has lost one fifth of its daily active users in the United States. By contrast, The Atlantic, led by Powell, increased subscribers, surpassing 1M last year.

A Fall from Grace and the Loss of Allies

The article that irritated Musk portrays his time at the White House as a failure, where he ended up isolated and at odds with key figures in the current U.S. government. It recounts a scene in which the Treasury Secretary shouted ""Fuck you!"" several times in the presence of former President Trump. This anecdote reflects the difficult political and personal situation of the magnate.

To make matters worse, Musk showed controversial behavior in a recent interview with Bloomberg, where he called journalist Mishal Husain an ""NPC"" for questions he considered standard. ""NPC"" refers to a non-playable character that appears in video games and is not controlled by a player, but by the game's system itself.

Both programs are administered by the federal government and can be applied for simultaneously without one affecting the other. To qualify, it is necessary to meet certain requirements. Gross monthly income must be below the established limits, which vary depending on household size.

For example, for a household of four people, the limit is $3,250. In some states, there are limits on the amount of assets a family can have to be eligible, and these generally range between $3,000 and $5,000.

Adults between 18 and 54 years old without dependents must work or participate in training programs at least 80 hours per month to receive benefits for more than three months in a three-year period. There are exceptions for people with disabilities, pregnant women, veterans, and other specific groups.

This Is How You Can Apply for Benefits: Take Note

The process to apply for SNAP varies by state, but generally includes completing an application. This can be done online, by mail, or in person at the local SNAP office.

After submitting the application, an interview is conducted, which can be by phone or in person. Evidence of identity, income, expenses, and immigration status, if applicable, is required. Once approved, an EBT card is received, which can be used to purchase food at authorized establishments.

Why Is This Double Payment So Important?

Assistance from the SSA through these programs is crucial for many families. SNAP provides assistance for purchasing food, while SSI offers financial support to older adults or people with disabilities. The combination of both benefits can make a significant difference in the well-being of low-income households.

Additionally, in some states such as California and Alaska, additional stimulus checks have been implemented to support residents. For example, in California, the Sacramento Family First program offers monthly payments of $725 to families that meet certain income criteria.",https://elcierredigital.com/filesedc/uploads/image/post/montaje-de-fotos-persona-sorprendida-dolares-de-fondo_1200_800.webp,N,0.0,2025-05-31 13:56:23.579532

This is the tax relief program known as the ""Anti-Displacement Tax Relief Fund,"" promoted by Invest Atlanta. This aims to ease the property tax burden for the most vulnerable homeowners.

SSA knows that many Americans need this relief: Pay attention if you live in this state

This program's main goal is to help homeowners in Atlanta face the increase in property taxes. This increase has been driven by the growth and revaluation of properties in the city.

With a $10M fund, financed in part by the Centennial Yards Housing Trust Fund, the program will cover any increase in property taxes above a set base over a period of 20 years for qualifying applicants.

Who can apply in Atlanta? SSA makes it clear

To be eligible for this program, applicants must meet the following requirements. For example, they must be at least 60 years old as of May 1, 2025, and have been the owner and resident of a home in the city of Atlanta since 2015.

Applicants must be actively enrolled in the city and county homestead exemption programs and have a clear property title, free of liens. In addition, they must not have any unsolved property tax appeals with the city at the close of the application period. The total household income must also be equal to or less than 60% of the Area Median Income (AMI).

According to SSA, applications for the program are open until today, May 31, 2025. It is crucial for interested parties to submit their application before the deadline, as no applications will be accepted after this period.

How to apply? A truly significant relief for these residents

Interested parties can submit their application online through Invest Atlanta's official platform. In addition, informational sessions have been organized to help applicants understand the process and program requirements.

With Atlanta's rapid growth and development, many long-term residents, especially older adults, face the threat of being displaced. This is all due to the increase in housing costs and property taxes. This program aims to provide significant relief to these residents, ensuring that they can remain in their homes and communities.",https://elcierredigital.com/filesedc/uploads/image/post/imagen-donald-trump-aguantando-dinero-manos-cartel-seguridad-social_1200_800.webp,N,0.0,2025-05-31 13:56:32.265684

This is part of the Brandon Act implementation, which aims to reduce the stigma of seeking mental health care.
Unlock your health by taking that first step—because mental health care is health care.","MAY 31, 2025 – Mental health is a vital part of your overall well-being. Whether you’re having difficulty managing day-to-day stress or navigating more complex challenges, TRICARE offers mental health support when—and where—you need it.

“Getting care early is just like preventive medicine, such as labs or regular checkups,” said Jeannine Pickrell, director for Population Health and Disease Management, TRICARE Health Plan, at the Defense Health Agency. “You can prevent smaller issues from becoming big ones by checking in with yourself through a TRICARE mental health provider. TRICARE offers a variety of ways to find and get the care you need.”

More than ever, people recognize the importance of mental well-being. Unlock your health by understanding how to access care based on your TRICARE plan.

Ways to access care

TRICARE has options for different mental health needs. Services are available whether you’re seeking support for the short or long term. Depending on your health plan, you may need a referral or pre-authorization.

You can start by:

Talking to your primary care manager

Reaching out directly to a TRICARE-authorized provider

Exploring virtual health options to speak with a provider from home

Not sure what applies to you? Check with your TRICARE contractor.

Covered mental health services

As described in the Mental Health and Substance Use Disorder Services Fact Sheet, TRICARE covers services can include:

Outpatient counseling like individual, group, or family therapy

Intensive outpatient programs that meet throughout the week

Partial hospitalization programs that meet throughout the week

Inpatient care at a hospital or other facility

Are virtual health services a better fit for you? TRICARE covers many virtual options for getting mental health care from your own home. Options include telemental health services through virtual-only providers, as well as local providers who may offer a combination of in-person and virtual health services.

How you access them is specific to your region:

East Region: The East Region contractor, Humana Military, offers services through Doctor on Demand, Teladoc, Telamynd, and Talkspace, as well as other smaller provider groups.

West Region: The West Region contractor, TriWest Healthcare Alliance, offers services through Doctor on Demand, Teladoc, Telemynd, Skytherapist, Fusion Care Group, NVelUp, Open Mind Health, Talkspace, and Veterans Room, as well as other smaller provider groups.

Overseas: If you’re overseas, the country where you live must allow virtual health services. Your provider must be licensed to practice where you live. Contact your TRICARE Overseas Regional Call Center for more information, including eligibility of providers. Visit the Overseas virtual health page to learn more about the overseas requirements.

However, there may be limitations on these services in certain areas to include Medication-assisted treatment, substance use disorder, and applied behavior analysis services may not be included.

To request telemental health services:

Use the Find a Doctor tool to search your regional contractor’s network provider directory.

Contact your regional contractor. You can learn more about the options available to you based on who you are and where you live.

Types of mental health care

TRICARE provides mental health coverage for all eligible beneficiaries. How you access them depends on your health plan, category, and whether care is immediate or ongoing.

Emergency mental health care

If you or someone you know is at immediate risk of self-harm, or harm to others, this is a medical emergency. Emergency mental health care doesn’t require a referral. You should:

Call 911 or go to the nearest emergency room.

Your TRICARE regional contractor should be contacted within 24 hours or next day, if admitted.

You can also call the Veterans Crisis Line:

Call 988, option 1.

Text 838255.

Chat online.

Again, if you or a loved one is in danger or needs urgent support, go to the nearest emergency room or call 911.

Nonemergency mental health care

You don’t need to be in crisis to seek help. TRICARE covers a range of mental health services. How you access them depends on your beneficiary group.

Here’s how it works:

Active duty service members

Care must begin at a military hospital or clinic, or a TRICARE-authorized provider for those enrolled in TRICARE Prime Remote.

ADSMs may also request an evaluation from their supervisor without providing a reason. These are confidential and protected. This is part of the Brandon Act implementation, which aims to reduce the stigma of seeking mental health care.

Referrals and pre-authorizations are required outside military hospitals or clinics.

All other TRICARE beneficiaries

Do you have TRICARE Prime?

You don’t need a referral if you see a TRICARE network provider.

Beyond basic outpatient care, a referral may be required.

Start with your PCM if you’re unsure what you need.

Do you have TRICARE Select?

You can visit any TRICARE-authorized provider for mental health services.

Referrals aren’t required, but you’ll pay lower out-of-pocket costs by choosing a network provider.

You don’t need a pre-authorization for routine care, but some specialty services may require one.

Do you have TRICARE For Life?

You should see a Medicare provider. Follow Medicare’s rules for mental health care until those benefits are exhausted.

Medicare is your primary payer. TRICARE is secondary.

If Medicare benefits are exhausted, you’ll need a referral and pre-authorization from TRICARE before you get care.

Are you a National Guard and Reserve member or family member?

Your eligibility and TRICARE coverage depend on the National Guard or Reserve member’s duty status. You should contact your unit’s personnel office with eligibility questions. You can review your eligibility in milConnect. When getting care, seeing a TRICARE network provider can reduce your costs. If you’re on active duty orders for:

More than 30 days: You’re eligible. You receive the same benefits as ADSMs.

30 days or less: You may be eligible to enroll in TRICARE Reserve Select.

Do you have a TRICARE health plan overseas?

Availability varies by location and some services may be limited. Contact the TRICARE Overseas contractor for help finding what is right for you.

Other resources include:

The Psychological Health Resource Center (866-966-1020) for community resources

The Military Health System Nurse Advice Line (800-874-2273, option 1) for mental health questions

Military OneSource (800-342-9647) for non-medical counseling services

Unit or military chaplains for non-medical support

U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs or VetCenter for eligible veterans

Taking the first step

When it comes to mental health challenges—or maintaining good mental health—you’re not alone. It’s okay to reach out to find the services right for you, and TRICARE has your back every step of the way.

Methods: We conducted a retrospective open cohort study on ADSW across the Military Health System (MHS) using data from the Military Health System Data Repository to analyze the changes in burden of mental disorder diagnosis in ADSW during the COVID-19 pandemic to provide insight into the need for behavioral health providers.
During the pre-COVID-19 period, 19.1% of ADSW had at least one mental disorder diagnosis compared to only 16.3% of ADSW during the COVID-19 period.
Conclusions: Our analysis indicates an increased burden of mental disorder diagnoses during the COVID-19 period; however, there was no disparity between mental health services received by Black ADSW and White ADSW overall during either the COVID-19 period or the pre-COVID-19 period, despite some variation by rank.

Results: We identified a total of 325,147 ADSW from October 2016 to February 2020 and a total of 305,626 ADSW from March 2020 to September 2022. During the pre-COVID-19 period, 19.1% of ADSW had at least one mental disorder diagnosis compared to only 16.3% of ADSW during the COVID-19 period. Adjusted regression analyses revealed that non-Hispanic Black, Hispanic, and Asian/Pacific Islander ADSW are less likely to have a mental disorder diagnosis compared to non-Hispanic White ADSW; however, interaction testing revealed a significant interaction between race/ethnicity and rank, resulting in higher odds of a mental disorder diagnosis across all ranks, excluding ""other"" rank, among non-Hispanic Black and Hispanic ADSW, and higher odds in Asian/Pacific Islander and American Indian/Alaska Native ADSW in enlisted ranks.

Conclusions: Our analysis indicates an increased burden of mental disorder diagnoses during the COVID-19 period; however, there was no disparity between mental health services received by Black ADSW and White ADSW overall during either the COVID-19 period or the pre-COVID-19 period, despite some variation by rank.

It was on the occasion of the recent school graduation of Infanta Sofía. On this very special occasion, to the surprise of many, the snapshots shared by Casa Real reveal an unknown and endearing aspect of Leonor and her sister's life.

Queen Letizia, just like her sister Telma, was an excellent ballet student during her childhood in Oviedo. Both were trained from an early age in this artistic discipline that requires perseverance, effort, and a remarkable ability to concentrate.

Those dance classes, beyond being merely an extracurricular activity, deeply shaped their way of facing life, cultivating values such as perfectionism and self-discipline.

Casa Real confirms the big news about Princess Leonor

Now, those lessons seem to have transcended generations. One of the photographs released by Zarzuela has especially caught the public's attention.

In it, Princess Leonor and Infanta Sofía appear hugging, dressed in identical leotards and ruffled skirts, both with impeccable tight buns and a light touch of makeup. The image, apparently captured before or after a school performance, shows not only their involvement in the activity but also the shared excitement of Leonor and Sofía.

Despite the age difference between them, two years, Leonor and Sofía wear the same outfit. This reinforces the idea that it is a joint performance, probably part of their extracurricular training. This image has been interpreted as a clear confirmation that the young royals have inherited the same passion for ballet as their mother.

Casa Real wants Leonor to be closer to the citizens

Casa Real hasn't issued a formal statement about this lovely hobby, but the gesture of sharing such a meaningful image hasn't gone unnoticed. At a time when the Royal Family is committed to closeness, showing Leonor's more human side helps strengthen the emotional bond between the public and the future queen.

Thus, Princess Leonor stands out not only for her military training or her impeccable institutional agenda, but also for an artistic sensitivity that connects with her maternal lineage. A detail that, without a doubt, adds a new dimension to her public figure and proves that in Zarzuela, passions that shape the soul, not just the crown, are also cultivated.",https://elcierredigital.com/filesedc/uploads/image/post/montaje-primer-plano-princesa-leonor-infanta-sofia-desenfocadas-camara-emoji-sorpresa_1200_800.webp,N,0.0,2025-05-31 07:56:20.516816

The story of this iconic burger chain is far from over and promises to keep making headlines in the U.S. market.","In the competitive U.S. fast food market, the battle between chains is more intense than ever. A brand with a long history and known for its sliders has decided to reclaim the spotlight. After years without opening new locations, Krystal announces an ambitious plan to launch more than 200 stores across the United States in the coming years.

The Return of an Iconic Brand

Krystal, founded in Tennessee in 1932, is famous for its small sliders and chili cheese pups. Its name was popularized by celebrities such as Elvis Presley, Jimmy Carter, and Ronald Reagan, who enjoyed its products. However, in the last decade, the chain was stagnant, with no new openings.

The reactivation began with the opening of a store in Tyler, Texas, on April 15. This store is Krystal's first to open 24 hours and is located inside a travel center, a strategic location to attract high-traffic customers. This launch marks only the beginning of an expansion that will lead the brand to open hundreds of new stores.

Strategy to Grow with Nostalgia and Modernity

The franchisee Highway 31 Food Service, responsible for the Tyler store, has plans to open more restaurants in Texas. Their vision is clear: to leverage the nostalgia that Krystal generates among customers, but with a format adapted to current times. The combination of convenience, accessibility, and a steady flow of visitors is the core of their model.

Despite having had a complicated path, the company has managed to reinvent itself. In January 2020, Krystal faced serious financial problems and filed for bankruptcy with a debt close to $100 million. However, after its acquisition by Fortress Investment Group, parent company of SPB Hospitality, its situation improved significantly.

Renewal and Competition in the Sector

Since changing hands, Krystal has improved its sales and doesn't plan to close stores. While many large chains have reduced their number of locations, Krystal is betting on transformation and sustained expansion. Part of that renewal includes modernizing its restaurants, with digital menus and improvements in drive-thru services.

Thus, the chain seeks not only to attract its loyal customers as always, but also new generations who seek speed and convenience. This resurgence marks a new stage for Krystal and presents a clear challenge to giants such as Burger King. The story of this iconic burger chain is far from over and promises to keep making headlines in the U.S. market.",https://elcierredigital.com/filesedc/uploads/image/post/montaje-exterior-restaurante-burger-king-chico-sorprendido_1200_800.webp,N,0.0,2025-05-31 05:56:23.036503

In November 2018, both families gathered in A Coruña to attend the wedding of Marta Ortega and Carlos Torretta.
The Origins of Carmen Echevarría, Marta Ortega's Mother-in-Law Carmen Echevarría was born in 1950 into a family settled in Oviedo.","Zara has commemorated the 50th anniversary (50th) of the opening of its first store in A Coruña. This is a very special anniversary for Inditex, which has placed the Ortega Pérez clan in the spotlight. Meanwhile, behind them, the Torretta family has ""reigned"" in the shadows since 2018, whose matriarch is Carmen Echevarría (Oviedo, 1950), the mother-in-law of Marta Ortega.

People say that Carmen is a key figure in the life of Inditex's non-executive chairwoman. She also plays an important role in the company her husband, designer Roberto Torretta, launched in 1996. But what role does Carmen Echevarría really play in Marta Ortega's life? What are her origins?

The ""Other Pillar"" of Inditex: Her Relationship With Marta Ortega

In 2017, businesswoman Carmen Echevarría made headlines nationwide. That year, her son, Carlos Torretta, and Marta Ortega, then the ""heiress"" of the Inditex empire, announced their engagement.

Until that moment, Carmen had been a very discreet figure in the glossy magazines despite being the ""matriarch"" of the Torretta family, one of the most renowned dynasties in international fashion.

Carlos and Marta's relationship was in the media spotlight from the beginning. However, people say that Carmen advised her son to keep a low profile. This is because Carmen is said to have had a significant influence on him since his childhood.

In November 2018, both families gathered in A Coruña to attend the wedding of Marta Ortega and Carlos Torretta. Carmen acted as the matron of honor and showed off her remarkable elegance, dressed in a black outfit, her signature color.

Since then, there has been much speculation about the relationship the Asturian businesswoman keeps with the Ortega Pérez family. Meanwhile, in particular, with her daughter-in-law Marta Ortega.

Apparently, the two are very close and they have shown it over the years at events such as equestrian days where the Torretta and Ortega Pérez families gather.

Marta and Carmen share a passion for fashion. Currently, the Asturian plays a key role in Roberto Torretta's company, where she works in the commercial department.

Together with her husband, she forms an iconic professional partnership and enjoys a life away from the spotlight in their exclusive villa in Torrelodones. Beyond business, Carmen is also delighted with her new role as grandmother to Matilda and Manuel, Carlos Torretta's children, and the three daughters of María Torretta.

The Origins of Carmen Echevarría, Marta Ortega's Mother-in-Law

Carmen Echevarría was born in 1950 into a family settled in Oviedo. She is very close to her sister Conchita, about whom little is known regarding her personal life.

The Asturian capital was where Carmen spent her childhood and adolescence, during which she studied economics. However, her destiny would take a different path.

The ""Matriarch"" of the Torretta Family

In the mid-seventies, Spain witnessed a process of opening up on all levels. The Transition had come to stay, and in 1977, Carmen Echevarría's life took a radical turn.

That year, the Oviedo native spent her summer vacation in Ibiza with her family. At that time, the Pityusic island was a true hippie paradise, where a young Argentine named Roberto Torretta arrived, making a living by selling pants on the island.

A spark ignited between them that culminated in 1981 when they decided to take their relationship a step further and got married. The couple chose the Pacha nightclub, one of the trendiest spots in Ibiza, to seal their story. They returned there years later to celebrate their silver wedding anniversary.

After getting married, Carmen Echevarría and Roberto Torretta settled in Madrid. The couple bought a house on the central Barquillo street. Both began to make their way in the fashion industry, which was booming at the time.

Carmen joined the team at the Loewe store on Serrano street. Later, she decided to open a costume jewelry boutique on the same street where she lived.

The Asturian's name began to resonate strongly in high society and fashion circles after the opening of Berlín, a multi-brand store where Roberto Torretta began selling garments from Snif, the first brand the Argentine launched on the market.

The opening of Berlín revolutionized fashion in Madrid. Carmen introduced new brands such as the exclusive Tod's, and her client list included personalities like socialite Marta Chávarri, Infanta Elena, or members of well-known dynasties such as the Martínez-Bordiú family.

Carlos and María Torretta, the couple's two children, grew up among fabrics and designs. Carlos was born in 1984 and María in 1986.

For Carmen, her children have been the most important thing in her life. In an interview, María Torretta confessed: ""My mother has made both my brother Carlos and me who we are.""

Both Carlos and María are very close to their parents and, since childhood, they have witnessed their effort and sacrifice.

Her Friendship With Massiel

Since settling in the Spanish capital, Roberto Torretta and Carmen Echevarría have always attended the major ""parties"" and premieres that brought together figures from the worlds of culture, politics, or music.

According to reports, Carmen Echevarría's circle includes names such as former politician Ana Botella and singer Massiel, whose friendship dates back to their childhood.

Massiel and Carmen met in Asturias. The ""Tanqueta de Leganitos"" spent much of her childhood between Gijón and Oviedo, as her parents, Emilio Santamaría and Concepción Espinosa, were Asturian.

The two became very close, and in fact, Massiel played a key role in Carmen's early business ventures in Madrid. The singer partnered with the Asturian in opening the jewelry boutique in the heart of Chueca (Madrid).

However, the business did not continue, but their friendship endured. So much so that Carmen and Roberto chose the Madrid-born singer as godmother for their daughter María's baptism.",https://elcierredigital.com/filesedc/uploads/image/post/captura-de-pantalla-2025-05-29-a-las-164447_1200_800.webp,N,0.0,2025-05-31 01:56:18.231301

Now, a senior advisor close to the monarch has provided new details about how he is handling this challenging period. A year and a half after starting his cancer treatment, Charles is trying to keep his daily life normal, facing the illness with a firm and positive attitude.

Charles III's Strength in the Face of the Diagnosis

According to a source close to the royal team, the king has learned to ""manage"" the illness and keeps a routine based on medical instructions. ""Medical science has advanced a great deal and, honestly, I don't see any difference in him,"" the advisor explained. As long as he strictly follows the doctors' recommendations, Charles III will continue to lead a normal life, something he has successfully achieved so far.

At 76 years old, the monarch has chosen not to reduce his official responsibilities. Unlike his wife, Kate Middleton, who temporarily stepped back due to her battle with cancer, Charles III continues to fulfill his public role. This decision has surprised and impressed many, who highlight his dedication and commitment to the Crown.

Official Engagements and Historic Moments

A clear reflection of his strength was the recent two-day visit he made to Canada with Queen Camilla. This trip was Charles III's first official visit as king to the country where he is also head of state. During the opening ceremony of the Canadian Parliament, the monarch delivered a historic speech, being the first British king to do so since 1957, when Queen Elizabeth II did it.

This visit marked an important milestone in his reign and showed his commitment to his official duties, despite the illness. Charles III took the opportunity to show strong leadership and an image of health amid the personal challenges he faces.

Ups and Downs in Health and an Encouraging Recovery

Even with his positive attitude, the fight against cancer hasn't been free of difficulties. On March 27, Charles III was hospitalized due to complications from his treatment, which forced him to cancel several official engagements and caused concern among the public.

However, sources close to the king's circle confirmed that his recovery has been gradual and favorable. A few days after his hospital admission, the monarch reappeared in public, dispelling the most alarming rumors about his condition. His presence proved that, although the illness is a challenge, Charles III keeps the strength needed to continue with his life and his duties.

This combination of personal strength and institutional commitment has been key for the British monarch to face this chapter of his life with complete dignity and responsibility. His example has served to inspire many people who are going through similar situations.",https://elcierredigital.com/filesedc/uploads/image/post/montaje-primer-plano-carlos-iii-traje-azul-alarma_1200_800.webp,N,0.0,2025-05-30 21:56:18.490397

They don't want to deal with that so their ""solution"" is not to sell to anyone with Tricare at all. This is all about them covering their own butts legally.

So even if you pay out of pocket, you still have Tricare. They likely won’t work with people on any government insurance to avoid any conflicts with government regulations (which are pretty in-depth) Because even if you are choosing not to bill Tricare you still fall under the regulations that Tricare has.

There is always a possibility that a person still manually submits a claim even if they don’t so it’s easier for them to just deny services altogether.

We're caught in a squeeze between insurance providers and the medical industry. Each is doing what ever they can to maximize their profits. Medical is charging as much as possible (Tricare limits what they can charge as another poster said) while insurance is denying as much as possible. The result is medical is disconnecting themselves from Tricare completely (it's better to make no money than to lose money) while Tricare will soon be bombarded by congressional inquires. Once Tricare is force to speak to congress, they will explain how the annual fees and copays are too low and need to be raised to continue to operate. They will also take the opportunity to scale back coverages further reducing their liability. Next, congress will agree to allow Tricare to raise annual fees and copays. Things will get better for some time but in 2 or 3 years we'll do this dance again. There's only 3 ways to solve this, first you can forgo your health and die, second you can forgo your insurance and pay cash for service, third you can vote for congressional / presidential representatives who are supportive of a national health plan based on annual income and completely dismantle the medical insurance companies.

The agency is demanding the return of $69,087.50 for overpayments related to benefits her late husband, Ed, received before passing away in 2012 due to leukemia. According to Podmanik, her husband Ed had repeatedly informed SSA that he had returned to work, but the agency kept sending him benefits.

Pensioner is forced to return nearly $70,000 to US SSA: she's outraged

Years later, upon retiring and beginning to claim the benefits corresponding to her husband, Ruth was informed that she had to return the full amount. Amid fears of losing her home, she emphasizes that the error was SSA's and not hers or her husband's.

This case has caused outrage and has exposed SSA's practices regarding the recovery of overpayments. The agency has been criticized for the measures they take against beneficiaries who received improper payments, many of whom are not at fault and can't afford to return the money. Recently, SSA announced actions to address the problem of overpayments and the associated injustices.

This may not be enough for people like Ruth Podmanik

Among the measures adopted, the SSA has reduced the automatic overpayment recovery rate to 10% of the monthly benefit, instead of the 100% that was previously applied. In addition, the agency has made it easier to request recovery waivers for those who are not at fault or can't return the money.

However, these measures may not be enough for people like Ruth Podmanik, who are facing significant debts due to administrative errors. SSA has stated that they are working to ensure that their overpayment recovery policies are fair and equitable, and that they do not unduly harm beneficiaries.

The Ohio pensioner still trusts SSA will acknowledge their error

Ruth's case has drawn media attention and sparked a debate about SSA's responsibility in managing benefits. Many are questioning how it is possible that administrative errors can have such serious consequences for people who depend on these benefits to survive.

Meanwhile, Ruth Podmanik is waiting for a favorable resolution to her situation.

Mental health is a vital part of your overall well-being. Whether you’re having difficulty managing day-to-day stress or navigating more complex challenges, TRICARE offers mental health support when — and where — you need it.

“Getting care early is just like preventive medicine, such as labs or regular checkups,” said Jeannine Pickrell, director for Population Health and Disease Management, TRICARE Health Plan, at the Defense Health Agency. “You can prevent smaller issues from becoming big ones by checking in with yourself through a TRICARE mental health provider. TRICARE offers a variety of ways to find and get the care you need.”

More than ever, people recognize the importance of mental well-being. Unlock your health by understanding how to access care based on your TRICARE plan.

Ways to access care

TRICARE has options for different mental health needs. Services are available whether you’re seeking support for the short or long term. Depending on your health plan, you may need a referral or pre-authorization.

You can start by:

Talking to your primary care manager

Reaching out directly to a TRICARE-authorized provider

Exploring virtual health options to speak with a provider from home

Not sure what applies to you? Check with your TRICARE contractor.

Covered mental health services

As described in the Mental Health and Substance Use Disorder Services Fact Sheet, TRICARE covers services can include:

Outpatient counseling like individual, group, or family therapy

Intensive outpatient programs that meet throughout the week

Partial hospitalization programs that meet throughout the week

Inpatient care at a hospital or other facility

Are virtual health services a better fit for you? TRICARE covers many virtual options for getting mental health care from your own home. Options include telemental health services through virtual-only providers, as well as local providers who may offer a combination of in-person and virtual health services.

How you access them is specific to your region:

East Region: The East Region contractor, Humana Military, offers services through Doctor on Demand, Teladoc, Telamynd, and Talkspace, as well as other smaller provider groups.

West Region: The West Region contractor, TriWest Healthcare Alliance, offers services through Doctor on Demand, Teladoc, Telemynd, Skytherapist, Fusion Care Group, NVelUp, Open Mind Health, Talkspace, and Veterans Room, as well as other smaller provider groups.

Overseas: If you’re overseas, the country where you live must allow virtual health services. Your provider must be licensed to practice where you live. Contact your TRICARE Overseas Regional Call Center for more information, including eligibility of providers. Visit the Overseas virtual health page to learn more about the overseas requirements.

However, there may be limitations on these services in certain areas to include Medication-assisted treatment, substance use disorder, and applied behavior analysis services may not be included.

To request telemental health services:

Use the Find a Doctor tool to search your regional contractor’s network provider directory.

Contact your regional contractor. You can learn more about the options available to you based on who you are and where you live.

Types of mental health care

TRICARE provides mental health coverage for all eligible beneficiaries. How you access them depends on your health plan, category, and whether care is immediate or ongoing.

Emergency mental health care

If you or someone you know is at immediate risk of self-harm, or harm to others, this is a medical emergency. Emergency mental health care doesn’t require a referral. You should:

Call 911 or go to the nearest emergency room.

Your TRICARE regional contractor should be contacted within 24 hours or next day, if admitted.

You can also call the Veterans Crisis Line:

Call 988, option 1.

Text 838255.

Chat online.

Again, if you or a loved one is in danger or needs urgent support, go to the nearest emergency room or call 911.

Nonemergency mental health care

You don’t need to be in crisis to seek help. TRICARE covers a range of mental health services. How you access them depends on your beneficiary group.

Here’s how it works:

Active duty service members

Care must begin at a military hospital or clinic, or a TRICARE-authorized provider for those enrolled in TRICARE Prime Remote.

ADSMs may also request an evaluation from their supervisor without providing a reason. These are confidential and protected. This is part of the Brandon Act implementation, which aims to reduce the stigma of seeking mental health care.

Referrals and pre-authorizations are required outside military hospitals or clinics.

All other TRICARE beneficiaries

Do you have TRICARE Prime?

You don’t need a referral if you see a TRICARE network provider.

Beyond basic outpatient care, a referral may be required.

Start with your PCM if you’re unsure what you need.

Do you have TRICARE Select?

You can visit any TRICARE-authorized provider for mental health services.

Referrals aren’t required, but you’ll pay lower out-of-pocket costs by choosing a network provider.

You don’t need a pre-authorization for routine care, but some specialty services may require one.

Do you have TRICARE For Life?

You should see a Medicare provider. Follow Medicare's rules for mental health care until those benefits are exhausted.

Medicare is your primary payer. TRICARE is secondary.

If Medicare benefits are exhausted, you’ll need a referral and pre-authorization from TRICARE before you get care.

Are you a National Guard and Reserve member or family member?

Your eligibility and TRICARE coverage depend on the National Guard or Reserve member’s duty status. You should contact your unit’s personnel office with eligibility questions. You can review your eligibility in milConnect. When getting care, seeing a TRICARE network provider can reduce your costs. If you’re on active duty orders for:

More than 30 days: You’re eligible. You receive the same benefits as ADSMs.

30 days or less: You may be eligible to enroll in TRICARE Reserve Select.

Do you have a TRICARE health plan overseas?

Availability varies by location and some services may be limited. Contact the TRICARE Overseas contractor for help finding what is right for you.

To find a network pharmacy, beneficiaries may call Express Scripts at 1-877-363-1303, or search the network pharmacy locator.

If possible, visit the pharmacy where the prescription was filled. Prescriptions filled by a retail chain may be filled at another store in that chain. If the clinician who prescribed the medication is available, beneficiaries can ask them to call in a new prescription to any network pharmacy.

As a reminder, TRICARE beneficiaries, other than active duty service members, may receive urgent care from any TRICARE-authorized urgent care center or provider and do not need a referral. This allows beneficiaries to seek nonemergency care for illnesses or injuries if their primary care provider is unavailable because of emergencies.

“This opportunity stems from the initiative and vision of Lt. Cmdr.","Naval Medical Center Camp Lejeune promotes a culture of excellence through building great people, leaders, and teams who exemplify clinical excellence, academic distinction, and outstanding leadership across all levels of professional practice.

Major recognition of that excellence came during the 2025 Military Health System Conference in Cleveland, Ohio when Navy Medicine announced that nurses from NMCCL were awarded the MHS Nursing Leadership Excellence Award in all three military categories. Awardees included Navy Cmdr. Reginald Middlebrooks as Senior Officer, Lt. Cmdr. Alainna Crotty as Midgrade Officer, and Lt. j.g. Jesse Brooks as Junior Officer.

According to award criteria, the MHS Nursing Leadership Excellence awards honors military nurses who have “demonstrated exemplary leadership skills and exceptional compassion and commitment to patients, colleagues, and the profession of nursing, resulting in noteworthy clinical or administrative accomplishments and contributing to the improved image and practice of nursing within the Military Health System.”

“Receiving the award is awesome, but it’s less of a reflection of what I did, and more a reflection on the leadership putting me in that position,” said Brooks. “In a culture like this one, I think setting the standard is important, and Cmdr. Middlebrooks and Lt. Cmdr. Crotty are different from other leaders; they engaged me, made suggestions… but in the end, let me make the decisions and run with it. I think that’s something to emulate, and it made an impression on me.”

Crotty mirrored his sentiments citing leadership engagement style as the reason for her success.

“Our culture here starts from our senior leaders who allow us to take the opportunities to drive enterprise level change,” said Lt. Cmdr. Alainna Crotty. “I am not given directives; they let me lead and gain experience that I need to move forward. They push us to jump on enterprise level initiatives that really put our names out [into the community].”

In addition to the awards, Middlebrooks, along with Cmdr. Sarah Louk, were selected as fellows in the University of Pennsylvania/Johnson & Johnson Nurse Innovation Fellowship – a first in NMCCL history.

“This opportunity stems from the initiative and vision of Lt. Cmdr. Alainna Crotty who led much of the groundwork behind our successful application,” said Middlebrooks. “This fellowship is designed to advance health care and drive transformative change within the organization.”

The fellowship is a combination of in-person and virtual sessions running through May 2026 and will allow the fellows to solve some of health care’s biggest challenges while maintaining an environment that fosters innovation within NMCCL.

“Camp Lejeune nurses are not only excelling within the walls of NMCCL but are also shaping policy, leading [Defense Health Agency]-level committees, and earning competitive research funding – securing over $200,000 in grants to advance evidence-based practice,” said Middlebrooks. “Each day, our nurses demonstrate a deep commitment to improving the care for our warfighters and beneficiaries. I believe the recent wave of recognition simply reflects a long-standing culture of excellence that our nurses have worked hard to build.”

(Tess Vrbin/Arkansas Advocate)

Two federal lawsuits filed Thursday argue that a new state law will harm hundreds of thousands of Arkansans by affecting access to needed medications.

Two of the country’s largest pharmacy benefit managers (PBMs) filed the complaints in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Arkansas, both arguing that Act 624 of 2025 violates the U.S. Constitution by interfering with interstate commerce. The suits also allege that federal law preempts state laws that affect employee health plans and Medicare coverage.

The suits filed by Express Scripts Inc. and CVS Pharmacy Inc. name the eight members of the Arkansas State Board of Pharmacy and its executive director as defendants. The new law empowers the pharmacy board to enforce its provisions.

Both complaints ask the court to bar enforcement of the law as well as declare it unconstitutional.

Act 624 “imperils the health” of 50,000 Arkansans who rely on Express Scripts for pharmacy benefits through their health insurance, the PBM’s complaint says.

The General Assembly created the law “for the exclusive benefit of Arkansas-based pharmacies who spearheaded the legislation in order to increase their market share by eliminating out-of-state competition,” the complaint states.

Health insurer Cigna owns Express Scripts; CVS Pharmacy owns the PBM Caremark Rx. Together with OptumRx, owned by United Healthcare, the PBMs manage 79% of prescription drug claims for approximately 270 million people, according to a 2024 Federal Trade Commission report.

Arkansas became the first state in the nation to ban large, vertically integrated healthcare companies from also operating drugstores in the state when Gov. Sarah Huckabee Sanders signed House Bill 1150 into law in mid-April. The law doesn’t take effect until January 2026.

“If left to stand, the law will have devastating consequences across Arkansas – including forcing numerous pharmacies operating in the state out of business, costing the more than 600 Arkansans employed at those pharmacies their jobs, and creating pharmacy ‘deserts’ for the nearly 40% of Arkansans who live in rural areas that often lack brick-and-mortar pharmacies,” Express Scripts asserts in its complaint.

“The law will also dangerously limit patient choice and deny access to lifesaving drugs at affordable prices by high-quality pharmacy providers. And it will create mass confusion among Arkansans about where and how they can receive needed prescription medications,” the suit adds.

In its complaint, CVS says that if the law takes effect on Jan. 1, the company “will have to cease not only its operations at 23 CVS retail pharmacies across the State, but also its mail-order and specialty-pharmacy services. Indeed, the law will likely shut down a substantial portion of all mail-order and specialty-pharmacy prescriptions flowing into the State because the majority of such providers are out-of-state pharmacies with PBM affiliations.”

The complaint notes that CVS’s 23 pharmacies served more than 340,000 patients and filled over 2.4 million prescriptions in 2024.

Complying with the law will impose undue burdens on CVS because of the intricacies of its corporate structure, the complaint says. CVS further claims the law already has begun affecting its business, as it has lost patients to in-state competitors and it’s become harder to attract and retain employees in Arkansas.

The CVS complaint calls Act 624 “a blatantly protectionist measure,” a characterization echoed in Express Script’s argument for a court-ordered injunction: “Because Act 624 is unconstitutionally protectionist, unconstitutionally punitive, and preempted by federal law, enforcement of the statute must be enjoined.”

Both lawsuits argue that the Arkansas law violates various commerce provisions of the Constitution, and CVS argues that it violates the equal protection clause by banning CVS and most other PBM-affiliated pharmacies from Arkansas while exempting “the only Arkansas-based pharmacy affiliated with a PBM [Walmart], without a rational justification for this distinction.”

Express Script’s complaint also notes that Act 624 will adversely affect members of the military, their families and veterans because the PBM is the primary mail-order pharmacy provider for Tricare, the military’s health insurance program.

The law allows the state pharmacy board to issue limited permits to PBMs if they provide “drugs that are otherwise unavailable in the market to a patient or a pharmacy that would otherwise be prohibited” under the law. Republican Sen. Kim Hammer of Benton, the law’s co-sponsor, told the Senate this will allow Tricare beneficiaries to continue receiving medications while PBMs transition out of Arkansas.

Attorney General Tim Griffin said in a statement that “Arkansas is standing up to PBMs on behalf of consumers” via Act 624 and vowed to defend the law.

“Pharmacy benefit managers wield outsized power to reap massive profits at the expense of consumers. The rise of PBMs as middlemen in the prescription drug market has resulted in patients facing fewer choices, lower quality care, and higher prices. PBMs leverage their affiliated pharmacies to manipulate prices, corrupt the market, and destroy competition,” Griffin said, echoing many of the talking points of the law’s proponents as it made its way through the Legislature.

Shortly before Act 624 became law, Griffin was the lead signatory of a bipartisan letter to Congress from attorneys general in 39 states and territories, advocating for the policy in Act 624 to be enacted federally.

My question is concerning mandatory Medicare sign-up requirements. Why do I have to sign up for Medicare coverage at 65 when I can’t start collecting full Social Security benefits until I turn 67? My Social Security benefits will not pay for my mandatory Medicare because I can’t start collecting full Social Security benefits until I’m 67!

I currently pay for Tricare and utilize my local Veterans Administration medical facilities and referrals for my healthcare. With me turning 65 and having to wait until I’m 67 for my full Social Security benefits, it just seems unfair that I’ll have to pay out-of-pocket Medicare monthly expenses for two years! Is there any way to avoid this unfair penalty? — Retired Navy Vet

DEAR RETIRED NAVY VET: First, I want to thank you for your military service to our country. Please know that here at the AMAC Foundation we care a lot about our veterans, and you may find the “For Veterans” section of our Foundation website interesting (amacfoundation.org).

Regarding your question, you should be aware that enrolling in Medicare is not mandatory, but there are consequences if you do not enroll when you become eligible (normally at age 65). For one thing, if you are a retired veteran on military TriCare, you will lose your TriCare benefits if you don’t enroll in Medicare when you are eligible (TriCare requires that you enroll in Medicare when eligible). And, since you are not yet collecting Social Security, you will be required to separately pay the Medicare Part B premium directly to Medicare (they will bill you when you enroll in Medicare).

Another potential consequence is that if you do not enroll in Medicare Part B when you are first eligible, you may incur a lifetime late enrollment penalty for enrolling in Part B later.

Something else to keep in mind is that there are two “parts” to Medicare — Part A (which is coverage for inpatient hospitalization services), and Part B, which is coverage for outpatient healthcare services (doctors, medical tests, etc.). Medicare Part A is free to you, but there is a premium for Medicare Part B ($185/month for 2025). Note that you will need to pay a Part B premium as long as you are enrolled in Medicare Part B (it doesn’t go away after you are collecting Social Security, but it is taken from your Social Security payment).

And there is no way for you to avoid the Part B premium after enrolling, and enrolling in Part B is necessary for you to continue your military TriCare-for-life benefits. Note that Medicare Part A and Part B do not include prescription drug coverage, but your TriCare coverage usually does.

It’s important to note that Medicare and Social Security are two independent senior programs with different eligibility rules. As you may know, you can collect early (reduced) Social Security at age 65 (and have your Medicare Part B premium deducted from your SS payment). But you would be collecting Social Security early and, in addition to a reduced benefit, you would also be subject to Social Security’s annual earnings test if you are still working. The SS earnings test limits how much you can earn before some of your SS benefits are taken away (if you exceed the earning limit prior to your full retirement age).

So, is it unfair that you must pay for Medicare Part B before you are collecting Social Security? Well, I think not, because the two programs are completely independent benefits (the Social Security Administration merely administers Medicare payments as a convenience). Remember, your Medicare Part A is free, but you must pay a premium for Part B, and you must take both to retain your military TriCare-for-Life benefits.
