Worse) priority group but they’ll automatically change depending on the rating you get. You are not automatically enrolled in va healthcare at all, no matter what your disability comes out to.

If you have a spouse and/or kids, you need to maintain Tricare anyway. Tricare for retirees is much less expensive than other medical insurance plans, so I highly suggest you keep it. Even though I’m a patient at the VA, I also see a Tricare provider. There are procedures you can get quicker through Tricare than the VA. I also use Tricare for second opinions.

I have both - I pay for Tricare Prime for my wife and I (exceedingly affordable - but you can also chose Tricare Select) and I am personally enrolled at the VA. I tend to try to not junk up the VA system with the stuff I can do easily via Tricare - the military facilities are linked to VA so all my records are still in one spot. VA can be better for physical therapy as they will offer care in the community - no co-pay and a therapist near your home or work. As a retiree I like having all the options of access to both. Once you hit 65, you’ll shift to Medicare and Tricare will become your secondary.

VA is healthcare and not insurance. They may send you to community for long wait time or care they do not provide but you will get most of your care at the VA. VA is a teaching hospitals so most of your providers are local medical school professors.

Tricare is just like any insurance company.

Every person situation is different and every VA is different. I only used VA for the past 18 years and they really take good care of me. I used have employer/ paid private insurance ( I am a nurse) and I just let VA bill my private insurance . My VA billing goes toward my private insurance annual deductible and I have no copay with VA.

I usually do all my visit, image and testing at the beginning of the year so VA can bill my private insurance all at once.

Once I hit annual deductible, all healthcare benefits are free and my private insurance does cover massage so I will go to free massage for the rest of the year. lol. 😂.",,N,1.0,2025-10-30 11:59:58.683033

The call came in to the home in the 500 block of Wesley Avenue at about 5:45 a.m., Fire Chief Kevin Vanegas said.

The fire was under control in about four hours.

The first units arrived within three minutes and found heavy fire showing, the chief said.

Fire crews made an aggressive interior attack to knock down the fire and prevent further extension. But deteriorating conditions inside led command to transition to a defensive operation to ensure firefighter safety, Vanegas said.

Multiple hose lines and master streams were deployed as exterior crews worked to bring the fire under control.

Mutual aid was requested from the Linwood and Northfield fire departments, who provided on-scene assistance. TriCare EMS and Pleasantville police also responded to support incident operations.

The Farmington Volunteer Fire Company and Ventnor Fire Department provided station coverage at Pleasantville's station, while off-duty city firefighters were called in to assist with staffing and equipment needs.

The fire was under control before 9 a.m.

The residence was occupied at the time of the fire, displacing eight adults and two children. The American Red Cross was notified and responded to assist the displaced family.

Anyone who wants to help can drop clothing and other essentials to Angels in Motion at 2 W. Glendale Ave. in Pleasantville.

In addition to the increase in retail pharmacy costs, Tricare will introduce new coverage for some procedures, according to the announcement.
During that time frame, patients also may switch between Tricare Prime and Tricare Select or enroll in the Federal Dental and Vision Insurance program.
“Tricare Prime Atlanta and Tricare Prime Tampa represent an innovative approach to advance access to care, enhance the patient experience, and strive for better health outcomes,” Dr. David Krulak, director of the Tricare Health Plan at the Defense Health Agency, said in a statement when the pilot was announced May 7.","Tricare health beneficiaries who fill prescriptions outside a military health facility will pay more for medications next year, but they will also have expanded access to new treatments for conditions like lung cancer and chronic back pain, under an announcement made by the federal government Tuesday.

In 2026, the rates for 30-day retail prescriptions will remain at $16 for generic drugs, but they will increase to $48 for brand-name medications. Ninety-day mail-order prescriptions will cost $14 for generic drugs and $44 for branded prescriptions. Non-formulary drugs will be $85 for the 30-day retail or 90-day mail-order prescriptions.

Prescriptions filled at military hospitals or clinics will continue to be available at no cost to patients, and active-duty personnel still won’t pay cost-shares or copays at retail pharmacies for covered medications.

The new rates reflect a 12% to 15.8% rise over the current copays, which were set at the start of 2024. The increase is part of a plan initiated in 2018 by Congress and the Defense Department to increase the share patients pay for their medical services through the military health program.

In addition to the increase in retail pharmacy costs, Tricare will introduce new coverage for some procedures, according to the announcement. Those include: radiofrequency ablation for uterine fibroids; cryosurgery for lung cancer or other cancers that have metastasized to the lungs; coronary calcium tests for patients suspected of having heart disease; and basivertebral nerve ablation for patients with chronic back pain.

Tricare also plans to cover the cost of electric devices, known as transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation, or TENS units, to address post-operative pain. Tricare will allow patients who meet the criteria for a likelihood of developing certain types of cancer to have prophylactic surgeries, including mastectomies and hysterectomies.

The military health program also will no longer require some dependents who have lost their hearing to use hearing aids for at least three to six months before being eligible for cochlear implants, according to the announcement.

Tricare will continue to cover monoclonal antibody drugs for early treatment of Alzheimer’s disease — a benefit it began last year. Patients must receive pre-authorization to receive the medication and must undergo testing to determine they have the condition.

Also beginning next year, active-duty family members and retirees and their eligible family members who live in Tampa, Florida, or Atlanta will be able to enroll in a new Tricare Prime option managed by CareSource Military and Veterans.

New Tricare Prime option coming to beneficiaries in 2 metro areas

The pilot, which will run through 2029, provides a new managed care program for military families beyond military treatment facilities or Tricare managed by Humana Government Business, the contractor for the East Region.

Beneficiaries interested in enrolling in the new program will be able to do so during Tricare Open Season, set for Nov. 10 through Dec. 9. During that time frame, patients also may switch between Tricare Prime and Tricare Select or enroll in the Federal Dental and Vision Insurance program. Open season for FEDVIP closes Dec. 8.

Step 2: Comprehensive Mental Health Evaluation A thorough psychiatric evaluation by a TRICARE-authorized mental health professional, like Dr. Block, is required.","When you've tried medication after medication without finding relief from depression, it's easy to feel like you've reached a dead end. The weight of persistent symptoms affects every aspect of your life, from your relationships and work performance to your sense of hope for the future. Fortunately, there are other options.

Diamond Edge TMS stands as an expert provider of innovative Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (TMS) therapy in Vancouver, WA. Led by Dr. Jerald Block, a board-certified psychiatrist with 25+ years of experience and three combat deployments, we understand the frustration of persistent depression and provide personalized, evidence-based care.

Our approach combines cutting-edge technology with compassionate support, specifically designed for military personnel, veterans, first responders, and their families. We encourage you to schedule an appointment to explore how TMS therapy can provide the breakthrough you've been seeking.

Schedule An Appointment

Understanding how TMS works and why it succeeds where other treatments may have failed is your first step toward reclaiming your mental health.

What is TMS Therapy, and How Does it Work?

Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation represents a fundamental shift in how we approach treatment-resistant depression. Unlike medications that work throughout your body's systems, TMS uses focused magnetic fields to directly stimulate specific brain regions involved in mood regulation. This precision targeting allows for therapeutic benefits without the systemic side effects commonly associated with antidepressants.

The Science Behind TMS

TMS works by delivering magnetic pulses to the prefrontal cortex, a brain region that's often underactive in people with depression. These magnetic pulses penetrate approximately 1-3 centimeters into brain tissue, stimulating neural activity in areas responsible for mood, emotion, and cognitive function.

The magnetic field strength used in TMS is similar to an MRI scan, but it's applied in focused pulses rather than continuously. This targeted stimulation helps restore normal neural activity patterns and promotes the formation of new neural pathways, a process known as neuroplasticity.

How TMS Differs from Other Treatments

Traditional antidepressants work by altering neurotransmitter levels throughout the brain and body. While effective for many people, this broad chemical approach can cause side effects and may not adequately address the specific neural activity patterns underlying treatment-resistant depression.

TMS offers several distinct advantages:

Direct Brain Stimulation: Works at the source of depression rather than through chemical intermediaries

Targeted Approach: Stimulates only the specific brain regions involved in mood regulation

No Systemic Effects: Doesn't circulate through your bloodstream or affect other organs

Preserves Cognitive Function: Maintains mental clarity and sharpness throughout treatment

Compatible with Daily Life: Allows you to maintain work, family, and personal responsibilities

The Treatment Experience

During a TMS session, you'll sit comfortably in a specialized chair while a trained technician positions a device against your head. The treatment feels like gentle tapping on your scalp. You remain fully conscious and alert throughout the 20-minute session, able to talk, listen to music, or watch television.

Most people experience only mild scalp discomfort during their first few sessions, which typically decreases as you become accustomed to the treatment. There's no anesthesia required, no recovery time needed, and you can drive yourself to and from appointments.

Treatment Protocols

Diamond Edge TMS offers both standard and accelerated treatment options:

Standard Protocol: Daily 20-minute sessions over approximately 7 weeks (36 total sessions). This approach has the most extensive research supporting its effectiveness and allows for gradual, sustained neural changes.

Accelerated Protocol: Multiple treatments per day over 5 consecutive days (36 to 50 total sessions). This intensive approach can be particularly valuable for individuals with time constraints due to military deployment, work schedules, or other commitments.

Who Qualifies for TMS Through TRICARE

Medical Necessity Criteria

To qualify for TMS therapy through TRICARE, patients must meet certain clinical requirements. These include:

A confirmed diagnosis of major depressive disorder (MDD) with moderate or severe symptoms.

A history of trying at least one or more antidepressant medications without sufficient relief, or experiencing significant side effects that prevent effective use.

A psychiatrist’s order for TMS therapy following a face-to-face evaluation and review of treatment history.

Meeting these criteria ensures that TMS is reserved for individuals who need advanced care when traditional therapies have not been enough.

Additional Considerations for Military Families

Military personnel, veterans, and their families often face unique stressors, from deployments and relocations to the lingering impact of trauma and chronic stress. These experiences can increase the likelihood of treatment-resistant depression.

Flexibility in treatment protocols: Accelerated TMS can be particularly helpful for service members who need care within a shorter timeframe due to duty schedules.

Support for co-occurring conditions: TRICARE recognizes that depression may exist alongside anxiety, PTSD, or sleep disorders, all of which are common in military populations.

Regional access: In the TRICARE West region, which includes Washington, Oregon, and surrounding states, Diamond Edge TMS provides specialized care for military families close to home.

Pre-Qualification Checklist

Before beginning TMS treatment through TRICARE, it’s helpful to gather the following information:

A list of antidepressants previously tried, including dosages, duration, and reasons for stopping.

Documentation of side effects or intolerances that interfered with treatment.

Notes on current symptoms and how they affect daily life and functioning.

A referral or documentation from your Primary Care Manager (PCM), if you’re enrolled in TRICARE Prime.

A history of other attempts to treat the depression, such as talk-therapy.

Having this information prepared can streamline the authorization process and help your care team at Diamond Edge TMS guide you quickly through the next steps

Overview of TRICARE Coverage for TMS Therapy

For military families, understanding insurance coverage is crucial when considering advanced treatments like TMS.TRICARE recognizes TMS as a covered benefit for eligible beneficiaries, reflecting the military healthcare system's commitment to providing comprehensive mental health services.

TRICARE Coverage Basics

Coverage applies to all TRICARE plans, including Prime, Select, Reserve Select, and TRICARE For Life. This coverage ensures that military families have access to innovative treatments when traditional approaches haven't provided adequate relief. This is particularly important given the unique mental health challenges faced by military personnel and their families.

Covered Indications

TRICARE covers TMS therapy when specific criteria are met:

The patient has a confirmed diagnosis of severe MDD as defined by the current DSM.

The patient has demonstrated a failure of one or more trials of a pharmacological medication and/or demonstrates an intolerance to psychopharmacologic medications.

The order for the TMS procedure is written by a psychiatrist (MD or DO), who has examined the patient face-to-face and reviewed the record.

Coverage Scope

TRICARE coverage for TMS includes:

Initial psychiatric evaluation and treatment planning

Complete TMS treatment protocol (typically 36 sessions)

Ongoing monitoring and assessment during treatment

Coordination with other mental health services as needed

The comprehensive nature of this coverage ensures that military families can access complete TMS treatment without facing significant financial barriers.

Regional Considerations

TRICARE operates through regional contractors (TRICARE West and TRICARE East), each with specific procedures for TMS authorization. Diamond Edge TMS serves the TRICARE West region, which includes Washington, Oregon, California, and other western states.

TRICARE West beneficiaries can work with their Primary Care Manager (PCM) to initiate the referral and authorization process. We assist families throughout this process, providing guidance and support to ensure smooth access to care.

Steps to Access TMS Therapy Through TRICARE

Navigating TRICARE authorization for TMS therapy involves several steps, but understanding the process helps military families prepare effectively and access care more quickly.

Step 1: Initial Primary Care Consultation

For service members with TRICARE Prime, start by scheduling an appointment with your TRICARE Primary Care Manager (PCM) to discuss your depression symptoms and treatment history. Come prepared with:

Detailed list of all previous antidepressant medications tried

Information about dosages, duration of use, and reasons for discontinuation

Documentation of any side effects experienced

Your PCM will review your medical history and determine whether you meet the initial criteria for TMS consideration. If appropriate, they'll provide referrals for psychiatric evaluation.

For service members and their families who have TRICARE Select, you may be able to skip meeting with the PCM and jump right to Step 2.

Step 2: Comprehensive Mental Health Evaluation

A thorough psychiatric evaluation by a TRICARE-authorized mental health professional, like Dr. Block, is required. This evaluation will:

Provide you with a diagnosis

Review your treatment history

Rule out contraindications for TMS therapy

Evaluate your suitability for treatment

To get started, contact Diamond Edge TMS to schedule your initial consultation.

Be thorough and honest during this evaluation. The more complete and accurate the assessment, the stronger your case for TMS authorization.

Step 3: Prior Authorization Submission

Your mental health provider will compile all necessary documentation and submit a prior authorization request to TRICARE. This submission includes:

Complete psychiatric evaluation report

Detailed treatment history documentation

Clinical justification for TMS therapy

Step 4: Authorization Review Process

TRICARE will review your case based on established medical necessity criteria. The review typically takes 1-2 weeks for routine cases, though complex situations may require additional time.

Step 5: Treatment Scheduling

Once TRICARE authorization is received, our team at Diamond Edge TMS will work with you to schedule your TMS sessions to accommodate your military duties and family responsibilities.

Step 6: Begin Treatment

You are now ready to begin your TMS treatment! Our experienced staff will guide you through the process and ensure that you feel comfortable and supported every step of the way.

As mentioned previously, during each session, you will be seated in a comfortable chair while a small device is placed against your head to deliver focused magnetic pulses to specific areas of your brain. The treatment is painless and non-invasive, allowing you to relax or engage in other activities during the sessions.

Frequently Asked Questions

Does TRICARE require prior authorization for TMS therapy?

Yes. TRICARE requires prior authorization before starting TMS therapy. This process involves a psychiatric evaluation, documentation of past medication trials, and clinical justification from a qualified provider. At Diamond Edge TMS, we guide you step-by-step through this process to make approval as smooth as possible.

How many TMS sessions does TRICARE cover?

TRICARE typically covers a full treatment course of 36 sessions, along with follow-up evaluations and monitoring. In certain cases, additional sessions may be authorized if medically necessary.

Can active duty military receive TMS therapy?

Yes. Active duty service members can receive TMS therapy with the appropriate referrals and authorization. Because scheduling can be complex, accelerated TMS protocols may be particularly useful for those balancing duty requirements with mental health care.

Will TMS therapy affect my security clearance?

Probably no more or less than antidepressants; the DoD mostly considers them equivalent. Seeking mental health care, including TMS therapy, does not automatically affect your security clearance. In fact, the Department of Defense encourages service members to seek treatment for mental health conditions, as doing so supports readiness and resilience. Untreated depression poses a greater risk to career and clearance than pursuing approved care.",https://storage.googleapis.com/treatspace-prod-media/pracimg/u-2915/blogwebp_0_bEZ7Qz8.webp,N,0.0,2025-10-29 09:59:34.968146

Delays in total joint arthroplasty are associated with decreased quality of life and may confer worse postarthroplasty outcomes.1 While the projected demand for total hip arthroplasty (THA) is estimated to increase over the next decades,2,3 access is tempered by variation in orthopedic surgeon location and training programs.4,5 To date, research has identified several patient- and structural-level factors associated with THA receipt across multi-institutional studies, national samples, and Military Health System (MHS), Veterans Health Administration, and Medicare and Medicaid beneficiaries.6-13 However, there is a lack of literature that accounts for nonsurgical guideline-congruent and guideline-incongruent care after osteoarthritis diagnosis (eg, opioid prescriptions, imaging, therapeutic interventions)14-19 and uses time-to-event models to account for longitudinal nuances in hip osteoarthritis care.

Given delayed and inadequate osteoarthritis treatment can negatively impact quality of life and incur financial burden,20 evaluating THA timing within the context of osteoarthritis-related care enables targeted intervention across large health care systems. In the MHS, patients receiving THA tend to be younger and male relative to national databases.21 Moreover, unlike private health care settings, surgeons in military treatment facilities do not contend with payers or receive increased reimbursement based on productivity. Patients enrolled in TRICARE insurance (eg, active duty and retired service members and their eligible family members) do not incur large out-of-pocket costs when receiving a THA within military treatment facilities (eg, direct care system) but may pay more in the civilian network (eg, purchased care system). Therefore, evaluating THA timing in MHS beneficiaries enables evaluation of the context of direct and purchased care systems.

The objective of this study was to evaluate time to THA after hip osteoarthritis diagnosis in patients enrolled in insurance plans in which some or all health care is provided at military treatment facilities, when such services are available at the local facility (eg, TRICARE Prime, TRICARE Plus, direct care only). These plans are like health maintenance organization plans in which patients must receive specialty care referrals (eg, orthopedic surgery, imaging) from their primary care managers. Other plans that are outside of the scope of this study, such as TRICARE Select, are akin to preferred provider organizations and incur higher out-of-pocket costs. It was hypothesized that variation in time to THA would be associated with patient-, care-, and structural-level factors, which would be maintained in sensitivity models evaluating patients receiving care in only the direct vs purchased care systems, separately. Given prior research, it was specifically hypothesized that THA receipt would be less likely in American Indian and Alaska Native, Asian and Pacific Islander, Black, and Hispanic patients and patients with another race and ethnicity compared with White patients; female patients compared with male patients; older patients compared with younger patients; and patients with fewer imaging, orthopedic surgeon, and therapeutic visits compared with those with more visits.

Methods

Study Design, Data Sources, and Record Selection

This retrospective cohort study was determined to be exempt from review and informed consent by the Uniformed Services University institutional review board because this study leveraged secondary research for which consent is not required, per the Revised Common Rule, 45 CFR 46.104(d)(4). This study followed the Strengthening the Reporting of Observational Studies in Epidemiology (STROBE) reporting guideline. Medical record data (eg, encounter records, prescriptions) were extracted from the MHS Information Platform. Records were included of adult patients ages 18 to 89 years, who received an International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems, Tenth Revision (ICD-10) M16 diagnosis for hip osteoarthritis (primary, posttraumatic, and unspecified osteoarthritis) between March 1, 2018, and June 30, 2023 (ie, index diagnosis), without prior documented diagnosis from March 1, 2015, to March 29, 2018, to ensure this diagnosis was the first within a 3-year period. There was no requirement that the hip osteoarthritis diagnosis be the primary diagnosis for the encounter.

Patients were excluded if they had an M16 diagnosis within 3 years prior to the index hip osteoarthritis diagnosis (including International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision [ICD-9] and ICD-10 diagnosis codes) or THA; did not have race and ethnicity documented in their medical records; were not an active-duty service member, retired service member (eg, served ≥20 years before separation), or family member; were not enrolled in TRICARE Prime, TRICARE Plus, or direct care only plans at index; had a diagnosis corresponding to cancer, infection, or hip fracture between index and censor dates; or lacked documented hip osteoarthritis diagnoses after the week of index diagnosis, as time-to-event analyses required censoring or the terminal event (THA receipt) to occur after the index (ie, week 0) and data were aggregated on the week-level. Therefore, all patients had at least 1 follow-up visit in which hip osteoarthritis was documented at least 1 week and up to 3 years after index. After identifying the index diagnosis, direct and purchased care records up to 3 years before and 3 years after the index diagnosis were extracted up until June 21, 2024. As such, some patients did not have 3 years of postindex records. The Figure provides a flowchart of included and excluded records.

Figure. Flowchart of Patient Selection and Inclusion

Primary Outcome

The primary outcome was time-to-THA receipt within 3 years after the index diagnosis. Receipt of THA was indicated by Current Procedural Terminology code 27130 or ICD-10 Procedure Coding System codes 0SR9*, 0SRA*, 0SRB*, 0SRE*, 0SRR*, or 0SRS*.

Model Covariates

Covariates included patient-, care-, and structural-level factors. Patient-level information included self-reported race and ethnicity recorded in the administrative records (American Indian and Alaska Native, Asian and Pacific Islander, Black, Hispanic, White, and another race and ethnicity [eg, >1 race and ethnicity]), sex (male or female), age, and beneficiary group (active-duty service member, retired service member, family member). Age was retained as a continuous variable in the models and categorized for descriptive purposes into 3 age groups: younger than 55 years, 55 to 69 years, and 70 years or older. Patient-level diagnosis covariates included those documented within 1 year before the index diagnosis. Diagnosis covariate flags (yes or no) included psychiatric diagnoses, pain-related diagnoses per prior literature,22 and obesity diagnoses per prior literature.23 An age-adjusted Charlson Comorbidity Index score24 was categorized as 0, 1, or 2 or greater. Tobacco use (yes or no) was defined as nicotine dependence diagnosis or self-reported and clinician-documented tobacco use. Care-related covariates included hip injections and hip imaging visits before index diagnosis using procedure codes described in prior studies25 (eAppendix in Supplement 1). Due to data skewness, 3-year preindex cumulative hip injections and hip imaging receipt were categorized as 0, 1, or 2 or more visits, each. Additional care-related covariates were time-dependent and cumulative, such that values could increase across time and had a maximum value of the 99th percentile due to data skewness. These covariates (99th percentile) included postindex cumulative opioid prescriptions (9 prescriptions) and days in which patients received hip imaging (7 days), orthopedic surgeon visits (6 days), and therapeutic visits (eg, physical therapy, biofeedback injections, other interventional pain therapies; 24 days). Hip injections and opioid prescriptions may have been for other pain-related conditions but could have contributed to hip osteoarthritis management. We used treatment days rather than encounters because some encounters included multiple procedure codes (eg, manual therapy, education, exercise therapy) and clinicians (eg, physical therapist, occupational therapist). At the index week, all postindex cumulative variables were set at 0, then increased by 1 with each care-related event. Lastly, structural-level information included the index care system (direct, purchased), year of index hip osteoarthritis diagnosis, and geographic area of index diagnosis per US Census regions and divisions.26 Divisions are a more specific geographic area and were used unless sample size warranted use of the region. Therefore, geographic area categories were Pacific (division), Mountain (division), Midwest (region), Northeast (region), West South Central (division), East South Central (division), South Atlantic (division), and in US Territories, in another country, or in an unknown location (neither a division nor region).

Statistical Analysis

Records were right-censored on the last recorded visit date if no THA occurred and no visits occurred after the 3-year postindex period or at 3 years after index if no THA occurred and visit records continued after 3 years. Nonparametric bivariate analyses (eg, Kruskal-Wallis tests, nonparametric χ2 tests) with pairwise tests and Benjamini and Hochberg–adjusted P values compared patients who (1) were excluded due not having race and ethnicity recorded in administrative records, as well as due to censoring in the index week (eg, had no other hip osteoarthritis visits after 1-week after the index diagnosis) vs included in the analysis (eTable 1 in Supplement 1), (2) those who did not and did receive a THA within 3 years after the index diagnosis, and (3) those who received hip osteoarthritis care in the purchased care system only, direct system only, or both systems (eTable 2 in Supplement 1). Bivariate tables were constructed using the compareGroups27 package in R software versions 4.4.0 to 4.5.1 (R Project for Statistical Computing). We used the survminer package28 in R to create unadjusted survival curves and a censoring table across races and ethnicities (eFigure 1 in Supplement 1).

The primary model was constructed in 2 steps. First, a Cox proportional hazards model (survival model) examined the assumption of proportionality for each covariate using the survival package29 in R. The proportionality assumption assumes the hazard ratio is constant across the observation period and all covariate levels. Covariates not meeting the proportionality assumption were modeled as fixed and time-varying covariates (eg, time × covariate interaction) in subsequent models.

The primary model was a piecewise exponential additive model, a generalized additive model (GAM) with a Poisson distribution, estimated using the pammtools30 and mgcv31 R packages. With GAM, continuous covariates with adequate ranges (eg, age) can be modeled as smooth covariates to model nonlinear associations between covariates and the outcome. Time-varying covariates are modeled as smooth covariates to allow for effects that can change across time (eg, nonproportional hazards). When time-varying covariates are not significant, the corresponding fixed covariates are interpreted alone. If corresponding fixed and time-varying covariates are significant, the fixed covariate indicates the geometric mean baseline hazard and the time-varying covariate is interpreted using visualizations to determine how the hazards change across time.32

Three sensitivity models were evaluated. Two GAMs replicated the primary model separately for patients who received hip osteoarthritis care solely in direct vs purchased care systems. A third GAM extended the direct care–only GAM by including a random effect for military treatment facility of index diagnosis. Due to sample size requirements with multilevel models, sites with at least 25 index diagnoses were included.

GAM results are rendered as incidence rate ratios (IRRs) with 95% CIs, which indicate the incidence of THA in a comparator group relative to the incidence in the reference group. For example, if the incidence rate was 10% in a comparison group and 20% in a reference group, the IRR would be 0.5 (10% / 20%). Results of the GAM were tabulated using the sjPlot R package.33 Estimated survival probabilities for fixed, smooth, and time-varying covariates were calculated using the pammtools R package30 based on the a priori reference categories of nonfocal variables as follows: White race and ethnicity, age 60 years, male, active-duty service member, with an age-adjusted CCI score of 1, no psychiatric or obesity diagnosis prior to the index diagnosis, with a pain-related diagnosis, index direct care system, index year 2020, index diagnosis in the South Atlantic geographic area, 0 hip injections or imaging visits prior to the index diagnosis, 1 imaging visit after diagnosis, 0 opioid prescriptions after diagnosis, and 2 therapeutic visits after diagnosis. These probabilities facilitate inferences regarding relative differences. Changes to a priori categories shift probability estimates. The cumulative hazard differences for significant time-varying smoothed covariates were calculated using the pammtools R package.30 Time-varying survival probabilities and cumulative hazard differences were visualized using the ggplot2 R package.34 P values were 2-sided, and statistical significance was set at P ≤ .05. Data were analyzed from July 2024 to August 2025.

Results

Sample Description

Overall, 37 239 patients (median [IQR] age 59 [50-64] years; 21 553 [58%] male) met all inclusion and exclusion criteria (Figure and Table 1). The cohort included 320 American Indian and Alaska Native patients (1%), 1603 Asian and Pacific Islander patients (4%), 8123 Black patients (22%), 2041 Hispanic patients (5%), 23 327 White patients (63%), and 1825 patients with another race and ethnicity (5%). Most patients had an index diagnosis for primary hip osteoarthritis (33 659 patients [90%]), followed by unspecified (2383 patients [6%]), hip dysplasia–related (578 patients [2%]), posttraumatic (389 patients [1%]), other (224 patients [1%]), and secondary (92 patients [<1%]) osteoarthritis. More than half of patients (20 821 patients [56%]) received all hip osteoarthritis care (eg, index and follow-up care) in the purchased care system only; 6896 patients (19%) received only direct system care for hip osteoarthritis; the remaining 9522 patients (26%) received hip osteoarthritis care across both systems. The median (IQR) proportion of hip osteoarthritis care provided in the direct care system was 0% (0%-64%) and the mean (SD) was 29% (40%). Of patients who received a THA, 9048 patients (86%) had a THA on the side matching their index diagnosis; 1113 patients (11%) had a THA on the side matching a postindex diagnosis; and 341 patients (3%) had an unspecified THA and/or hip osteoarthritis side or were unmatched in laterality.

Across the 3-year postindex period and without accounting for censoring, 502 patients (28%) received a THA. Proportions were highest among White patients (7406 patients [32%]), followed by patients with another race and ethnicity (432 patients [24%]), and American Indian and Alaska Native (72 patients [23%]), Black (1827 patients [23%]), Hispanic (438 patients [22%]), and Asian and Pacific Islander (327 patients [20%]) patients. Of patients who received a THA, the unadjusted time to THA was lowest for Hispanic patients (median [IQR], 28 [14-59] weeks), followed by White patients (median [IQR], 29 [14-65] weeks), patients with another race and ethnicity (median [IQR], 31 [14-68]), Asian and Pacific Islander patients (median [IQR], 34 [15-69] weeks), Black patients (median [IQR], 36 [16-77] weeks), and American Indian and Alaska Native patients (median [IQR], 44 [15-81]). Proportions were higher and time to THA lower for male (6533 patients [30%]; median [IQR], 29 [14-65] weeks) relative to female (3969 patients [25%]; median [IQR], 32 [15-70] weeks) patients and for retired service members (6089 patients [33%]; median [IQR], 29 [13-62] weeks) and family members (3526 patients [27%]; median [IQR], 33 [15-71] weeks) compared with active-duty service members (887 patients [16%]; median [IQR], 38 [17-78] weeks). Patients younger than 55 years had the lowest proportions of unadjusted THA receipt (13 325 patients [21%]), followed by patients 70 years and older (6098 patients [28%]) and ages 55 to 69 years (17 816 patients [34%]). However, patients 70 years and older had the shortest time to THA (median [IQR], 27 [13-60] weeks) compared with patients ages 55 to 69 years (median [IQR], 30 [14-66] weeks) and younger than 55 years (median [IQR], 34 [15-74] weeks). Patients receiving a hip osteoarthritis diagnosis in the direct care system had both higher proportion of THA receipt (4120 patients [31%]) and longer time to THA (median [IQR], 34 [16-71] weeks) than in the purchased care system (6382 patients [27%]; median [IQR], 28 [13-64] weeks). Lastly, THA receipt was highest and time to THA shortest in the Mountain area (1166 patients [33%]; median [IQR], 27 [13-62] weeks), whereas THA occurred least often and with the longest duration for patients in US territories, in other countries, or in an unknown location (128 patients [14%]; median [IQR], 45 [23-88] weeks). Unadjusted survival curves and censoring frequencies by race and ethnicity, sex, beneficiary group, age group, system of diagnosis, and geographic area are in eFigure 1 in Supplement 1.

Bivariate analysis indicated patients included vs excluded varied across all tested variables (eTable 1 in Supplement 1). All potential covariates, aside from an obesity diagnosis, were significantly different between patients who did not and did receive a THA (Table 1). In the Cox proportional hazards models, several variables across both primary and sensitivity models were not proportional and therefore were included as time-varying covariates.

Primary Model

Time to THA varied across several patient-, care-, and system-level covariates. Asian and Pacific Islander patients (IRR, 0.76; 95% CI, 0.66-0.88; P < .001), Black patients (IRR, 0.79; 95% CI, 0.74-0.85; P < .001), and Hispanic patients (IRR, 0.84; 95% CI, 0.73-0.96; P = .01) had lower incidence of THA compared with White patients across time (Table 2; eFigure 4 in Supplement 1). There was a significant time-varying effect for Black patients, such that cumulative hazard differences steeply decreased within the first year, with less intense decreases afterward. Adjusted probabilities indicated that an estimated 37% (95% CI, 32%-42%) of White patients received a THA by 3 years after the index diagnosis, followed by Hispanic patients (34%; 95% CI, 29%-40%), patients with another race and ethnicity (33%; 95% CI, 28%-39%), American Indian and Alaska Native patients (32%; 95% CI, 24%-42%), Asian and Pacific Islander patients (30%; 95% CI, 25%-36%), and Black patients (28%; 95% CI, 24%-33%). To examine how a priori levels of nonfocal covariates might affect estimates, probabilities were recalculated to change the assumption of direct care index diagnosis to purchased care. Adjusted probabilities maintained the same order, with White patients having the highest estimated probability of THA at 3 years (18%; 95% CI, 16%-21%), followed by Hispanic patients (17%; 95% CI, 14%-20%), patients with another race and ethnicity (16%; 95% CI, 13%-19%), American Indian and Alaska Native patients (15%; 95% CI, 11%-21%), Asian and Pacific Islander patients (15%; 95% CI, 12%-18%), and Black patients (13%; 95% CI, 11%-16%). Adjusted probabilities across races and ethnicities are depicted in eFigure 2 in Supplement 1.

IRRs and 3-year adjusted probabilities were lower for patients who had (probability, 21%; 95% CI, 27%-35%) vs did not have (probability, 37%; 95% CI, 32%-42%) a psychiatric diagnosis (IRR, 0.79, 0.76-0.83; P < .001), had (probability, 37%; 95% CI, 32%-42%) vs did not have (probability, 49%; 95% CI, 43%-55%) a pain-related diagnosis (IRR, 0.69; 95% CI, 0.66-0.72; P < .001), and had (probability, 34%; 95% CI, 30%-40%) vs did not have (probability, 37%, 32%-42%) an obesity diagnosis (IRR, 0.92; 95% CI, 0.88-0.96; P < .001) prior to the index diagnosis. Patients with a CCI score of 2 or greater were less likely to undergo THA (probability, 32%; 95% CI, 28%-36%) compared to those with a CCI score of 0 (probability, 35%; 95% CI, 30%-41%) (IRR, 0.85; 95% CI, 0.74-0.97; P = .02). Patients diagnosed in the purchased care system (probability, 18%; 95% CI, 16%-21%) compared with the direct care system (probability, 37%; 95% CI, 32%-42%) were less likely to undergo THA (IRR, 0.38; 95% CI, 0.36-0.40; P < .001), and those diagnosed in later years (eg, 2022: probability, 36%; 95% CI, 32%-42%) were less likely to receive THA than those diagnosed earlier (eg, 2018: probability, 38%; 95% CI, 33%-43%) (IRR, 0.97; 95% CI, 0.95-0.99, P = .001). Patients with 1 (probability, 32%; 95% CI, 27%-37%) or more (probability, 29%; 95% CI, 25%-34%) preindex injections were less likely to receive THA than those who received none (probability, 37%; 95% CI, 32%-42%) (1 injection: IRR, 0.83; 95% CI, 0.77-0.90; P < .001; >1 injections: IRR, 0.75; 95% CI, 0.70-0.81; P < .001). Patients with at least 2 preindex imaging visit days (probability, 34%; 95% CI, 28%-40%) were less likely to receive THA than those with 0 visit days (probability, 37%; 95% CI, 32%-42%) (IRR, 0.77; 95% CI, 0.69-0.86; P < .001) (Table 2; eFigure 2 in Supplement 1). Probabilities and incidences were higher for retired service members (probability, 49%; 95% CI, 45%-53%) and family members (probability, 50%; 95% CI, 45%-55%) compared with active-duty service members (probability, 37%; 95% CI, 32%-42%) (retired service members: IRR, 1.39; 95% CI, 1.24-1.56; P < .001; family members: IRR, 1.48; 95% CI, 1.30-1.69; P < .001). Male patients were more likely to receive THA (probability, 37%; 95% CI, 32%-42%) compared with female patients (probability, 32%; 95% CI, 28%-37%) (IRR, 1.20; 95% CI, 1.11-1.31; P < .001). Patients with increasing orthopedic surgeon visit days after the index diagnosis (eg, 0 days: probability, 22%; 95% CI, 19%-26%; vs 2 days: probability, 58%; 95% CI, 52%-64%) were more likely to receive THA (IRR, 1.67; 95% CI, 1.64-1.69; P < .001), as were those with more opioid prescriptions (eg, 0 prescriptions: probability, 37%; 95% CI, 32%-42%; vs 2 prescriptions: probability, 43%; 95% CI, 38%-49%; IRR, 1.02; 95% CI, 1.01-1.03; P = .002) or more imaging visit days (eg, 0 days: probability, 30%; 95% CI, 26%-35%; vs 2 days: probability, 45%; 95% CI, 39%-50%; IRR, 1.26; 95% CI, 1.24-1.28, P < .001) (Table 2; eFigure 2 in Supplement 1). IRRs varied in direction across geographic areas. Compared with patients diagnosed in the South Atlantic area (probability, 37%; 95% CI, 32%-42%), those diagnosed in the Midwest (probability, 46%; 95% CI, 40%-53%) (IRR, 1.35; 95% CI, 1.22-1.49; P < .001), Mountain (probability, 45%; 95% CI, 39%-51%) (IRR, 1.34; 95% CI, 1.22-1.46; P < .001), and Pacific (probability, 42%, 36%-48%) (IRR, 1.30; 95% CI, 1.20-1.40; P < .001) areas had higher incidence of THA; whereas, patients diagnosed in a US territory, another country, or an unknown location had lower incidence (probability, 24%; 95% CI, 18%-31%) (IRR, 0.64; 95% CI, 0.52-0.78; P < .001).

Several smooth and time-varying covariates were also significant, indicating that longitudinal hazards were nonproportional for several covariates (Table 2). Therefore, visualizations are provided in eFigures 2 to 5 in Supplement 1. Lastly, adjusted cumulative probabilities of THA receipt across covariate values at 1, 2, and 3 years after the index diagnosis are reported in eTable 4 in Supplement 1.

Sensitivity Analysis

In the first set of sensitivity GAMs, 6896 patients were included in the direct care–only GAM and 20 821 patients were included in the purchased care–only GAM (eTable 2 in Supplement 1). Therefore, 9522 patients who had hip osteoarthritis care across both systems were removed from this analysis. There were 6165 patients included in the sensitivity analysis of patients receiving all hip osteoarthritis care in the direct care system with an index diagnosis at a military treatment facility with at least 25 included patients. Each sensitivity model required different time-varying covariates.

The significant associations found in the primary model were similar to the sensitivity models with some exceptions. Similar to the primary model, Black patients had lower IRRs across all 3 models (direct care: IRR, 0.74; 95% CI, 0.66-0.82; P < .001; purchased care: IRR, 0.77; 95% CI, 0.68-0.88; P < .001; direct care with facility random effect: IRR, 0.84; 95% CI, 0.73-0.96; P = .01) than White patients (eTable 3 and eFigure 4 in Supplement 1). Asian and Pacific Islander patients had lower IRR in both the primary and purchased care models (IRR, 0.72; 95% CI, 0.55-0.95; P = .02); there was a lack of statistically significant differences in the direct care models. While patients with another race and ethnicity did not significantly vary in time to THA in the primary model compared with White patients, the IRR was lower in the purchased care model (IRR, 0.80; 95% CI, 0.65-0.97; P = .02). The significantly lower IRRs in the primary analysis for Hispanic patients did not maintain in the sensitivity models. Male patients had higher IRRs in the primary and purchased care models (IRR, 1.29; 95% CI, 0.17-1.43; P < .001) compared with female patients, but not in the direct care sensitivity models. The association of having 2 or more preindex imaging visits with lower IRRs compared with none in the primary model was maintained in the purchased care model (IRR, 0.80; 95% CI, 0.68-0.93, P = .004) and direct care sensitivity model with the facility-level random effect (IRR, 0.76; 95% CI, 0.60-0.90; P = .02). Patients with CCI scores 2 or greater and fewer opioid prescriptions had lower IRRs in the primary model but lacked significance across the 3 sensitivity models.

IRR varied across geographic areas, with differences in the direction of associations across models. Compared with the South Atlantic area, patients in the Midwest had higher incidence of THA in the purchased care model (IRR, 1.28; 95% CI, 1.10-1.48; P = .001), similar to the primary model, but lower incidence in the direct care model with the facility-level random effect (IRR, 0.29; 95% CI, 0.12-1.70; P = .006). Similarly, patients in the Mountain area had higher incidence of THA in the purchased care model (IRR, 1.45; 95% CI, 1.27-1.66; P < .001), like the primary model, but lower incidence in the direct care model (IRR, 0.61; 95% CI, 0.46-0.80; P < .001).

Discussion

In this cohort study, several patient-, care-, and structural-level factors were associated with time to THA in a sample of patients enrolled in TRICARE Prime, TRICARE Plus, and direct care–only plans. Similar to prior research, Asian and Pacific Islander, Black, and Hispanic patients, compared with White patients, and female patients, compared with male patients, were less likely to receive a THA across time.6-8,13 In sensitivity analyses of subsamples receiving all hip osteoarthritis care in the direct vs purchased care systems, Black patients and female patients had lower hazards of THA across time. While older patients and retired service members and family members had higher THA hazards relative to younger patients and active-duty service members, respectively, the discrepancies increased within the first year, then plateaued. Most athletes return to sports within 6 to 12 months of hip arthroplasty,35 but return may be contingent on the physical demands of the sport.36 For active-duty service members, not being able to maintain physical fitness requirements for an extended period may have negative career implications (eg, reduced deployability, medical separation).37 Alternatively, younger patients and active-duty service members may have received an osteoarthritis diagnosis earlier in the disease process, which could be more amenable to nonpharmacological and pharmacological management. Taken together, patient-level variation in time to THA within the MHS is similar to prior studies and warrants further investigation into osteoarthritis diagnosis timing and referral pathways.

Delay in THA may be due to systemic barriers across geographic areas, especially for patients in the purchased care system whose health care is not delivered in a centralized facility. In a 2018 study,38 Black patients had worse presurgical pain and functioning before THA; after surgery, Black patients residing in areas with higher proportions of Medicaid enrollees and people whose incomes were below the federal poverty threshold had worse outcomes than those living in less socioeconomically marginalized areas. However, White patients who resided in areas with high vs low socioeconomic marginalization lacked differences.38 In a Medicare claims evaluation,39 hospital service areas with higher proportions of Black residents tended to have fewer surgeons per capita. Other studies have reported that Black and Hispanic patients undergoing total joint arthroplasty were less likely to receive care from high-volume hospitals, which may result in worse outcomes.40,41 In this study, geographic area was associated with THA receipt, but variation across geographic areas with direct vs purchased care systems highlights the need to evaluate and incorporate orthopedic surgeon locations, structural factors, and beneficiary residences within geospatial modeling to optimize personnel allocation and care access.

Patients who received their index hip osteoarthritis diagnosis in purchased care were less likely to receive a THA across time relative to those diagnosed in direct care. This finding demonstrates challenges with purchased care access, which may be due to reduced reimbursement rates42 or increased care navigation demands. It is unclear whether increasing reimbursement rates or access to care navigators would improve THA timeliness. Prior research indicates that the Medicare Comprehensive Care for Joint Replacement Model may have improved total knee and hip arthroplasty accessibility for Hispanic patients but may have reduced accessibility for Black patients, with no changes in receipt for White patients.43 While increasing direct care recapture is a Department of Defense goal,44 it is unclear whether the direct care system has adequate capacity, per reports by both the Government Accountability Office and Department of Defense Inspector General.45,46 As a result, access to THA, as well as hip osteoarthritis care consistent with the policy-directed Stepped Care Model for Pain,47 may be stymied. Recommendations from these reports highlight the need to fully evaluate health care requirements, accessibility, barriers, and staffing to implement effective strategies across direct and purchased care systems.

Because the MHS is a single-payer system, surgeon allocation and care models could be altered to optimize timely THA access, reduce delay, and enhance value-based care. However, recent estimates indicate total joint arthroplasty volumes at military treatment facilities and among its orthopedic surgeons are generally low, and surgeons with the highest volume are still considered to have a relatively medium volume48 compared with prior research.49 Restructuring the MHS to enable high-volume arthroplasty hospitals and surgeons could improve patient outcomes and reduce costs.40,41,50,51 Future restructuring requires a thorough evaluation of factors preventing high-volume arthroplasty facilities and surgeons, as volume could be attributed to many factors (eg, surgical and imaging personnel, equipment, and room availability; patient transportation; and access to post-THA physical therapy).

Limitations

This study has several limitations. Several factors associated with THA (eg, osteoarthritis symptom severity, hip joint trauma history, morphology, environmental exposures) were not available in these data, and the proportion of patients with posttraumatic hip osteoarthritis index diagnoses was small (1%). To account for symptom severity, analyses included time-dependent health care covariates that could offset THA need (eg, therapeutic visits) or made THA more likely (eg, imaging and orthopedic surgeon visits).52 The aggregated therapeutic visits variable incorporated many care types; specific conclusions regarding which therapies were attributed to THA timing were outside the study scope. Recorded diagnoses may be provisional and may not represent finalized or confirmed diagnoses. Therefore, there were several bivariate differences between patients who were included vs excluded from the sample due to not having a follow-up osteoarthritis visit at least 1 week after the index diagnosis. Evaluating why patients did not continue hip osteoarthritis care was outside the study scope. This study did not include patients whose race and ethnicity were not recorded in their records; bivariate analyses indicated that patients without race and ethnicity in their administrative records were disproportionately family members of TRICARE policy holders. Historically, TRICARE registration is done by the primary policy holder (eg, active-duty or retired service member), and policy holders are not required to report the race and ethnicity of family members. Therefore, findings may not generalize to patients who are family members. While management of hip and other lower-limb conditions could indirectly affect hip osteoarthritis symptoms and this study leveraged hip imaging and injection codes used in previous work, it is not possible to confirm their use was for hip osteoarthritis or the specific injection type. Due to the lack of adequate sample sizes at purchased care hospitals, analyses could not incorporate a random effect for facility in the primary and purchased care models. This study only included patients enrolled in specific TRICARE and direct care–only plans; therefore, generalizability to patients in other health care systems may be limited.

Conclusions

This cohort study identified variation in time to THA among MHS beneficiaries. Consistent with US Government Accountability Office and Department of Defense Inspector General reports, future research could be used to improve THA accessibility and reduce barriers by accounting for structural inputs, such as personnel availability and reimbursement rates within the context of geographic location.",https://cdn.jamanetwork.com/ama/content_public/journal/jamanetworkopen/939703/zoi251101f1_1761061286.41293.png?Expires=2147483647&Signature=LRB98x-9ruaDwtBT24qXNIkMHdaTsuzraPvY2pTd4Z19P10I8F9oIgZQmTKAxwR1NE-QELmaBbLxIYcPC4a0XEpSm6BGd0Vqtole0ang13OmI2tSel~AXZwMWVUQOK47Ex5VjE4iCA6e-QQef10-ZOol0m6YhvW-LQfecz7PZAb46orfsaZScV0o6De49eB6D61Vlia2nTP-YStDYGkeqQZvyszyJX0yEYoxW5ra2~HqHjbfBQpoHU2wlmDNfwYH~80R5WI7kZmvobPvjf20iG4haE0G9Ob2wYAxEWp4suoT8pODELpMPc6Zg7eM-VAi3Ed0O7o1TCgiOPxmWLfZpg__&Key-Pair-Id=APKAIE5G5CRDK6RD3PGA,N,0.0,2025-10-28 16:21:47.937022
