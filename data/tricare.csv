Mellinger pleaded guilty to wire fraud and assisting in the preparation of false tax returns, impacting TRICARE and the IRS.

The scheme involved disguising illegal profits as royalties and leveraging client investigations for personal gain.

The broader Mississippi pain cream fraud case involved over $1.5 billion in fraudulent claims across multiple states.

A Florida man who pleaded guilty in Mississippi to orchestrating a scheme to promote an illegal tax shelter and commit wire fraud was sentenced to eight years in prison and ordered to pay nearly $40 million in restitution.

Stephen Mellinger in 2017 was named as a person connected to what would become known as the Mississippi pain cream scheme that netted more than 20 arrests and unveiled approximately $515 million in health-care fraud in Mississippi alone.

Mellinger also pleaded guilty to assisting in the preparation of false tax returns for tax shelter clients. He must repay over $35.6 million to the IRS and $2.1 million to TRICARE.

Mellinger pleaded guilty to the charges in February at the William M. Colmer Federal Courthouse in Hattiesburg. He was sentenced Wednesday, May 14.

In late January 2016, several pharmacies and businesses throughout Mississippi were raided by law enforcement, leaving people wondering what was going on.

It took time for the case to unfold, but the fraud, which had its beginnings in Hattiesburg, had tentacles across the country, from California to Connecticut and many states in between, totaling over $1.5 billion in fraud.

TRICARE was the main target of the pain cream fraud, involving high-priced compounded pain creams, scar creams, weight-loss remedies and vitamins. Compounded formulas are meant to be tailored to individual patients, but in this case, were formulated to maximize profit.

Mellinger's fraudulent tax shelters also took time to unfold — nearly a decade, according to court documents.

Mellinger, according to court records, was helping some of the perpetrators of the pain cream fraud avoid paying income tax on illegally obtained profits by claiming them as royalties paid for using intellectual property rather than reporting the money as revenue.

He had other clients for which he orchestrated investments in similar tax shelters, but when he learned his clients involved in the pain cream scheme were under investigation by the federal government and a civil forfeiture issued, he began using that as leverage to get even more money from those clients.

(“Zynex” or the “Company”) ( ZYXI) securities between March 13, 2023 and March 11, 2025, inclusive (the “Class Period”).

What Happened?

On June 4, 2024, medical journal STAT published a report on Zynex entitled “How a device maker inundated pain patients with unwanted batteries and surprise bills.” The report claimed Zynex engaged in an “oversupplying scheme” by sending inordinate amounts of monthly supplies like electrode pads and batteries in order to “bill insurers for thousands of dollars more than it otherwise could.” The report further revealed that, as a result of this practice, insurers were “kicking the company out of network.”

On this news, Zynex’s stock price fell $0.50 per share, or 5%, to close at $9.35 per share on June 4, 2024, on unusually heavy trading volume.

On March 11, 2025, after the market closed, Zynex reported its fourth quarter and full year 2024 financial results, revealing a significant revenue “shortfall” in the quarter “due to slower than normal payments from certain payers.” Zynex further revealed “Tricare has temporarily suspended payments as they review prior claims.” Tricare is the health insurance program for the U.S. military.

On this news, Zynex’s stock price fell $3.59 per share, or 51.3%, to close at $3.41 per share on March 12, 2025, on unusually heavy trading volume.

What Is The Lawsuit About?

The complaint filed in this class action alleges that throughout the Class Period, Defendants made materially false and/or misleading statements, as well as failed to disclose material adverse facts about the Company’s business, operations, and prospects. Specifically, Defendants failed to disclose to investors: (1) that Zynex shipped products, including electrodes, in excess of need; (2) that, as a result of this practice, the Company inflated its revenue; (3) that the Company’s practice of filing false claims drew scrutiny from insurers, including Tricare; (4) that, as a result, it was reasonably likely that Zynex would face adverse consequences, including removal from insurer networks and penalties from the federal government; and (5) that, as a result of the foregoing, Defendants’ positive statements about the Company’s business, operations, and prospects were materially misleading and/or lacked a reasonable basis.

If you purchased or otherwise acquired Zynex securities during the Class Period, you may move the Court no later than May 19, 2025 to request appointment as lead plaintiff in this putative class action lawsuit.

Hi Justine,

The Extremity Trauma and Amputation Center of Excellence, otherwise known as EACE, leads the advancement of extremity trauma-related research and clinical practice in the Military Health System—aiming to ensure a better future for those with extremity trauma. The center is run by the Defense Health Agency.

For answers, we turned to Andrea Crunkhorn, who applies her doctorate in physical therapy and status as the chief of clinical programs for EACE to support our injured warfighters and the clinicians who care for them. She had this to say.

--

EACE serves as the Defense Health Agency’s center of excellence for limb trauma and limb loss. We focus on the best-supported scientific and medical data and health care for service members and other Department of Defense community members with these injuries. We foster clinical practice and provide support tools to clinicians, patients, families, and caregivers. We help the clinicians who work with these patients be as efficient and effective as possible.

EACE assists our providers as they rehabilitate our wounded warriors and create a new normal for all patients with extremity trauma and amputation. Our specialists and staff work with the Department of Veterans Affairs to create internationally recognized clinical practice guidelines, so all limb rehabilitation follows the same best evidence.

The DOD and VA published the current upper limb amputation clinical practice guideline in 2022. These documents are regularly reviewed and updated to add new treatments and programs that improve patient care. DOD-VA published our revised clinical practice guideline for lower limb amputation rehabilitation in January 2025.

EACE offers every patient like your husband a guide called “Within Reach: The Journey After Upper Limb Amputation.” The guide provides information on coping skills, pain management, caring for your remaining limb, physical rehabilitation, and artificial limbs. The guide is available digitally on the EACE website under clinical affairs.

For soon-to-be parents, parents, families, and caregivers, we have a helpful handout, “Pregnancy, Childcare and Parenting after Upper Limb Amputation Rehabilitation.” It includes tips such as how to manage child care tasks.

The DOD Amputation Prosthetics Clearinghouse is a new portal for advice, discussion, and referral to one of the three Advanced Rehabilitation Centers in the DHA. The three ARCs are located at Walter Reed National Military Medical Center in Bethesda, Maryland, where I work; Brooke Army Medical Center in San Antonio, Texas; and Naval Medical Center San Diego, in San Diego, California.

These programs lead to advances in treating and restoring function after limb trauma and amputation. The centers are the only military hospitals that fabricate and modify artificial limbs. They also provide high-quality care from before surgery until you can return to your community.

You and your military hospital or clinic providers can reach out to me and my staff with questions at either of these emails: dha.ncr.Medical-Affairs.mbx.amputation-prosth-coe@health.mil. Additionally, phone numbers for contacts at each ARC are available on the fact sheets.

Other resources include the VA’s Amputation System of Care or its Polytrauma/TBI System of Care.

EACE also has information on surgeries such as directly attaching an artificial limb to the patient’s bone. This surgery can help patients who have difficulty tolerating a socket.

EACE focuses on research that can save injured limbs, avoid amputations, and preserve and restore injured limb function. We work to make our patients return to the highest possible level of physical, mental, and emotional function. Our warfighters deserve no less. We truly appreciate all that you do.

Justine,

As you can tell, you and your husband have a lot of support in this recovery. Stay safe out there.",https://d1ldvf68ux039x.cloudfront.net/thumbs/photos/2411/8763232/1000w_q95.jpg,N,0.0,2025-05-15 12:56:38.608579

Participants can register by visiting https://tx.ag/MedicaidAndMilitary. Once registered, participants will receive a confirmation email containing the webinar link.

About the webinar

Medicaid has played a vital role in providing health coverage for individuals and families with low incomes and special care needs. For military-connected families, Medicaid can serve as a valuable complement to TRICARE, particularly for those caring for family members with special healthcare needs.

Additionally, Medicare may become a critical source of coverage for individuals transitioning out of military service due to separation or retirement.

The webinar will be led by Christopher Plein, Ph.D., Eberly Family Professor for Outstanding Public Service Emeritus at West Virginia University.

Learning objectives

Identify how Medicaid supports military-connected families, including those on active duty, in the National Guard and Reserve and those who are retired or separated from service.

Describe the interaction between Medicaid and TRICARE in providing healthcare coverage.

Explore the role of Medicaid Home and Community-Based Services waivers in supporting dependents with special care needs.

Review current policy developments and proposed changes in Medicaid that may impact military-connected families.

Business and Operational Highlights BiomX announced positive topline results from its Phase 2 trial evaluating BX211 for the treatment of diabetic foot osteomyelitis (DFO).
Strategic Initiatives and Corporate Developments In April 2025, BiomX shareholders approved the exercise of warrants issued in the $12 million financings announced in February 2025.
These funds are expected to support the company's activities through the anticipated Phase 2b results for the BX004 trial.
Future Outlook BiomX anticipates reporting topline results for the BX004 Phase 2b study in cystic fibrosis in the first quarter of 2026.","BiomX Inc., a clinical-stage company advancing novel natural and engineered phage therapies targeting specific pathogenic bacteria, has released its financial results for the first quarter ended March 31, 2025. The company also provided updates on its business and clinical programs.

Financial Highlights

For the first quarter of 2025, BiomX reported a net loss of $7.7 million, a significant improvement from the $17.3 million net loss in the same period of 2024. The decrease in net loss is primarily attributed to changes in the fair value of warrants issued in previous financings. Research and development expenses increased to $5.3 million from $4.1 million in the first quarter of 2024, driven by preparations for the Phase 2b clinical trial of BX004 and increased expenses related to the Phase 2 trial of BX211. General and administrative expenses slightly decreased to $2.5 million from $2.7 million in the same period last year.

Business and Operational Highlights

BiomX announced positive topline results from its Phase 2 trial evaluating BX211 for the treatment of diabetic foot osteomyelitis (DFO). The trial demonstrated that BX211 was safe, well-tolerated, and produced statistically significant improvements in ulcer size and depth compared to placebo. Additionally, the company is on track to report topline results for its BX004 Phase 2b study in cystic fibrosis (CF) in the first quarter of 2026.

Strategic Initiatives and Corporate Developments

In April 2025, BiomX shareholders approved the exercise of warrants issued in the $12 million financings announced in February 2025. These funds are expected to support the company's activities through the anticipated Phase 2b results for the BX004 trial. The company also highlighted the significant non-dilutive funding of approximately $40 million from the U.S. Defense Health Agency (DHA) for the BX211 program.

Management's Perspective

Jonathan Solomon, Chief Executive Officer of BiomX, expressed satisfaction with the company's progress, particularly the positive Phase 2 results from the BX211 program. He emphasized the importance of these results in reinforcing the potential of phage therapy to address serious, resistant infections. Solomon also highlighted the company's focus on the upcoming Phase 2b readout of BX004 in cystic fibrosis, supported by recent financings.

Future Outlook

During the first quarter, BiomX initiated the exploration and analysis of real-world evidence in people with CF on the relationship between P. aeruginosa reduction and clinical outcomes. Regulatory discussions with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (“FDA”) and other regulatory authorities are expected in the second half of 2025, during which we intend to present our plans to analyze real-world evidence and seek endorsement that supports potential future regulatory filings.

Business Update

On April 21, 2025, a BiomX Special Meeting of stockholders took place during which shareholders approved the exercise of certain warrants issued as part of the Company’s $12 million financings announced in February 2025. The completed financings will provide runway expected to support the Company’s activities into the first quarter of 2026, when the Company anticipates the readout of topline Phase 2b results for BX004 for the treatment of CF patients with chronic pulmonary infections caused by P. aeruginosa.

First Quarter 2025 Financial Results

Cash balance and restricted cash as of March 31, 2025, were $21.2 million, compared to $18.0 million as of December 31, 2024. The increase was primarily due to funds raised in the February 2025 financings, partly offset by net cash used in operating activities. BiomX estimates its cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash are sufficient to fund its operations into the first quarter of 2026.

Research and development expenses, net were $5.3 million for the first quarter of 2025, compared to $4.1 million for the first quarter of 2024. The increase was primarily due to the following factors: preparations for the Phase 2b clinical trial of the Company’s CF product candidate, BX004; an increase in expenses relating to the Phase 2 clinical trial of the Company’s DFO product candidate, BX211; and an increase in rent and related expenses following the March 2024 acquisition of Adaptive Phage Therapeutics (APT). This increase was partly offset by higher grants BiomX received.

General and administrative expenses were $2.5 million for the first quarter of 2025, compared to $2.7 million for the first quarter of 2024. The decrease is primarily attributed to expenses incurred during 2024 in connection with the acquisition of APT completed in March 2024, partially offset by increased salaries and share-based compensation expenses.

Net loss was $7.7 million for the first quarter of 2025, compared to $17.3 million for the first quarter of 2024. The decrease is mainly due to the change in the fair value of the warrants issued as part of the Company’s financing completed in March 2024.

Net cash used in operating activities for the three months ended March 31, 2025, was $8.7 million, compared to $11.4 million for the same period in 2024.

About BX211

BX211 is a phage treatment for the treatment of DFO associated with S. aureus. DFO is a bacterial infection of the bone that usually develops from an infected foot ulcer and is a leading cause of amputation in patients with diabetes. In March 2025, BiomX announced positive topline results from the Phase 2 trial in which BX211 was demonstrated to be safe and well-tolerated and patients receiving BX211 exhibited statistically significant1 and sustained reduction of ulcer size (PAR)(p = 0.046 at week 12; p=0.052 at week 13), with a separation from placebo starting at week 7 and a difference greater than 40% by week 10. In addition, BX211 also produced statistically significant1 improvements in both ulcer depth at week 13 (in patients with ulcer depth defined as bone at baseline, ulcer depth was classified according to deepest tissue involved as measured by swab) (p=0.048), and in reducing the expansion of ulcer area (p=0.017). Over the 12-week treatment period, all patients (treatment and placebo) were treated in accordance with standard of care, including with systemic antibiotic therapy as appropriate. BiomX is currently planning a Phase 2/3 trial, pending discussions and feedback from the FDA.

About BX004

BiomX is developing BX004, a fixed multi-phage cocktail, for the treatment of CF patients with chronic pulmonary infections caused by P. aeruginosa, a main contributor to morbidity and mortality in patients with CF. In November 2023, BiomX announced positive topline results from Part 2 of the Phase 1b/2a trial where BX004 demonstrated improvement in pulmonary function associated with a reduction in P. aeruginosa burden compared to placebo in a predefined subgroup of patients with reduced lung function (baseline FEV1<70%). BiomX expects to initiate a randomized, double blind, placebo-controlled, multi-center Phase 2b trial in CF patients with chronic P. aeruginosa pulmonary infections. The trial is designed to enroll approximately 60 patients randomized at a 2:1 ratio to BX004 or placebo. Treatment is expected to be administered via inhalation twice daily for a duration of 8 weeks. The trial is designed to monitor the safety and tolerability of BX004 and is designed to demonstrate improvement in microbiological reduction of P. aeruginosa burden and evaluation of effects on clinical parameters such as lung function measured by FEV1 and patient reported outcomes. Pending progress of the trial, topline results are expected in the first quarter of 2026. The FDA has granted BX004 Fast Track designation and Orphan Drug Designation.

The Company will host a conference call and webcast today at 2:00 PM ET

NESS ZIONA, Israel, May 15, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- BiomX Inc. (NYSE American: PHGE) (“BiomX” or the “Company”), a clinical-stage company advancing novel natural and engineered phage therapies that target specific pathogenic bacteria, today announced financial results for the first quarter ended March 31, 2025, and provided program and business updates.

“The first quarter of 2025 was a period of exceptional progress for BiomX, both on the corporate front and across our clinical pipeline,” said Jonathan Solomon, Chief Executive Officer of BiomX. “The strength of the positive Phase 2 results from our BX211 program in diabetic foot osteomyelitis exceeded our expectations and received resounding endorsement from key opinion leaders and industry experts. These positive results represent a significant milestone for the field of bacteriophage therapy and further reinforce our platform’s potential to address serious, resistant infections. Notably, the BX211 program has been supported to date by approximately $40 million in non-dilutive funding from the U.S. Defense Health Agency (DHA), which has identified an urgent need for new treatments to combat antibiotic-resistant infections in current and future conflict environments. The work received DHA and Department of Navy funding under an Other Transaction Authority (OTA) award through the Medical Technology Enterprise Consortium (MTEC) and managed by the Naval Medical Research Command (NMRC) – Naval Advanced Medical Development (NAMD). We are currently in discussions regarding potential next steps in partnership with the DHA to further advance this program. Looking ahead, we remain focused on our next major catalyst, which is the anticipated Phase 2b readout of BX004 in cystic fibrosis in the first quarter of next year, supported by the recent financings we secured to advance this program and extend our operational runway.”

Clinical Program Updates

BX211 – phage for the treatment of DFO associated with Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus)

In March 2025, BiomX announced positive results from the Company’s DFO Adaptive Novel Care Evaluation (DANCE™) Phase 2 trial evaluating its BX211 phage treatment for DFO associated with Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus).

Key highlights from the Phase 2 trial results included:

BX211 was found to be safe and well-tolerated.

BX211 produced sustained and statistically significant1 Percentage Area Reduction (PAR) of ulcer size (p = 0.046 at week 12; p=0.052 at week 13), with a separation from placebo (standard of care) starting at week 7 and a difference greater than 40% by week 10.

Compared to placebo, BX211 also produced statistically significant1 improvements in both ulcer depth at week 13 (in patients with ulcer depth defined as bone at baseline) (p=0.048), and in reducing the expansion of ulcer area (p=0.017), compared to placebo.

BX211 demonstrated favorable trends compared to placebo across several additional clinical parameters, including: proportion of visits with no clinical evidence of infection; evidence of resolving DFO by MRI/X-ray at week 12; proportion of patients with abnormal C-Reactive Protein at baseline that achieved a reduction of CRP of at least 50% at any point in the study; and greater Wagner scale improvement2.

Through week 13, BX211 demonstrated comparable efficacy against both Methicillin-susceptible and resistant strains, as well as against high and low biofilm producers—consistent with the orthogonal mechanism of phage therapy to antibiotics and its inherent anti-biofilm capabilities.

A key opinion leader (KOL) event discussing the Phase 2 results took place on April 3, 2025. A replay of the webcast is available here, the content of which does not form a part of this press release.

Pending feedback from the FDA, BiomX is planning for a Phase 2/3 clinical trial of BX211.

,,2025-05-15 03:05:33+00:00,Arnold & Porter,A Lost Cause: Jury Finds CVS Caused the Submission of False Claims by Subsidiary Omnicare,"Paula Ramer, Laura Turner",,,,,https://www.arnoldporter.com/en/perspectives/blogs/fca-qui-notes/posts/2025/05/a-lost-cause,"On April 29, 2025, a federal jury in the Southern District of New York found Omnicare liable for illegally dispensing drugs to elderly and disabled people in long-term care facilities without legitimate prescriptions.
In addition, the jury determined that Omnicare’s parent company, CVS Health Corporation (CVS), which acquired Omnicare in 2015, caused the false claims to be submitted.
The government further alleged that CVS “caused” the claims to be submitted, as it was aware of deficiencies in Omnicare’s practices but failed to correct them.
After the government rested its case, CVS filed a motion for a directed verdict, arguing that the government failed to satisfy its burden that CVS “caused” the false claims to be submitted.
Judge McMahon reserved judgment on the motion, finding that there was enough evidence for the jury to determine false claims liability for CVS.","On April 29, 2025, a federal jury in the Southern District of New York found Omnicare liable for illegally dispensing drugs to elderly and disabled people in long-term care facilities without legitimate prescriptions. A unanimous jury concluded that Omnicare, the largest long-term care pharmacy in the United States, fraudulently billed Medicare, Medicaid, and TRICARE, a government military healthcare program, for more than three million false claims totaling more than $135 million in damages — one of the largest jury verdicts ever in an FCA case. If trebled, damages could reach more than $400 million, plus penalties. In addition, the jury determined that Omnicare’s parent company, CVS Health Corporation (CVS), which acquired Omnicare in 2015, caused the false claims to be submitted.

The relator, an Omnicare pharmacist, filed suit in 2015, and in 2019 the federal government, 29 states, and the District of Columbia intervened. The four-week jury trial began on April 1, 2025. The government alleged that Omnicare dispensed drugs to individuals in assisted living and other long-term residential facilities that were not supported by valid prescriptions under state law and then submitted claims for reimbursement for those prescriptions to the federal healthcare programs. The government further alleged that CVS “caused” the claims to be submitted, as it was aware of deficiencies in Omnicare’s practices but failed to correct them. CVS focused its defense heavily on a materiality argument, arguing that the practice at issue was allowed by law in many states and accepted by the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services.

After the government rested its case, CVS filed a motion for a directed verdict, arguing that the government failed to satisfy its burden that CVS “caused” the false claims to be submitted. Judge McMahon reserved judgment on the motion, finding that there was enough evidence for the jury to determine false claims liability for CVS. Specifically, she found the evidence showed that CVS “had ultimate oversight over Omnicare’s compliance with Government program regulations — indeed, was required to do so by virtue of the [Corporate Integrity Agreement]” that CVS had entered into in 2016 related to different conduct by Omnicare; and “that [CVS] was aware of the compliance issues that underlie this case, and the fact that certain fixes had been proposed to remedy them” but “opted not to force [Omnicare] to adopt those fixes.”

The parties will submit briefing over the next month addressing the penalties to be assessed under the FCA, and CVS has said that it plans to appeal the decision. We at Qui Notes will continue to keep you updated on developments in the case.

In response to the Governor’s May Revision to the 2025-26 state budget, California Medical Association (CMA) President Shannon Udovic-Constant, M.D., issued the following the statement:

""The Newsom administration’s decision to divert voter-approved Proposition 35 and Proposition 56 funds is a direct violation of the will of California voters.

""Instead of honoring the clear intent of Prop 35 and voters – to increase access to care for Medi-Cal patients through a protected funding stream – the Governor is proposing to use this money to patch a budget shortfall of the state’s own making. At the same time, the Governor is repurposing Prop 56 dollars (passed in 2016) that provide critical funding to family planning and reproductive health care services and dental care.

""During the first quarter of 2025, we completed our third Phase 2 study, specifically our Phase 1b/2a diSArm study of intravenous AP-SA02 as a potential treatment for complicated S. aureus bacteremia,"" stated Dr. Deborah Birx, Chief Executive Officer of Armata. ""Topline data is anticipated in the second quarter of 2025 to support a potential future pivotal efficacy trial. We recently announced additional award funding from the DoD through MTEC, which will be used to continue the support for the AP-SA02 product candidate and activities required for the end-of-Phase 2 meeting with the FDA to align on an efficient path toward Phase 3 and registration.""

""We continue to stay true to our mission of evaluating phage-based therapeutics in rigorously designed, randomized controlled clinical trials that can support potential regulatory approval, and I am very pleased with our progress to date,"" Dr. Birx concluded.

First Quarter 2025 Financial Results

Grant and Award Revenue. The Company recognized grant and award revenue of $0.5 million for the three months ended March 31, 2025, compared to $1.0 million in the comparable period in 2024. This represents MTEC's share of the costs incurred for the Company's AP-SA02 program for the treatment of S. aureus bacteremia.

Research and Development. Research and development expenses for the three months ended March 31, 2025 were approximately $5.4 million, compared to approximately $8.0 million for the comparable period in 2024. The Company continues to invest in clinical-related expenses associated with its primary development programs.

General and Administrative. General and administrative expenses for the three months ended March 31, 2025 were approximately $3.3 million, compared to approximately $3.2 million for the comparable period in 2024. The increase of $0.1 million is primarily related to an increase of $0.5 million in personnel expenses and an increase of $0.1 million in lease expenses, partially offset by a decrease of $0.5 million in consulting fees.

Loss from Operations. Loss from operations for the three months ended March 31, 2025 was approximately $8.2 million, compared to a loss from operations of approximately $10.2 million for the comparable period in 2024.

Net Loss. The net loss for the first quarter of 2025 was $6.5 million, or $0.18 loss per share on a basic and $0.20 loss per share on a diluted basis, as compared to a net loss of $25.0 million, or $0.69 loss per share on both a basic and diluted basis, for the comparable period in 2024. The net loss for the quarter ended March 31, 2025 included a non-cash gain from changes in fair value of the Company's convertible loan of $5.2 million, compared to a $13.0 million non-cash loss from changes in fair value of the Company's convertible loan for the quarter ended March 31, 2024.

Cash and Cash Equivalents. As of March 31, 2025, Armata held approximately $11.7 million of unrestricted cash and cash equivalents, compared to $9.3 million as of December 31, 2024.

Interested patients will be able to enroll in the new Tricare Prime option during open season, which runs from early November through early December.
After receiving the Tricare Prime program contract last November, the company's chief executive officer said the new programs are intended to increase access to care for Tricare Prime beneficiaries and provide personalized support.
Families of active-duty personnel who use Tricare Prime pay no annual enrollment fees, cost-shares or copayments.
Tricare Prime is not available to retirees and family members ages 65 and older who use Tricare For Life and Medicare.","Active-duty family members, retirees and their eligible family members who live in Atlanta or Tampa, Florida, will have a new option for health care next year: Tricare Prime managed by CareSource Military and Veterans.

The nonprofit organization was awarded a contract in 2024 to run a three-year demonstration project to provide Tricare Prime, the Defense Department's managed care-style health program, to more than 146,000 eligible beneficiaries in the two cities, beginning in 2026.

The new agreement, which will run through 2029, gives another health care option for military beneficiaries and allows the Defense Health Agency to evaluate having other health care entities manage portions of the Tricare patient load alongside Humana Government Business, which holds the Tricare East Region contract.

""Tricare Prime Atlanta and Tricare Prime Tampa represent an innovative approach to advance access to care, enhance the patient experience, and strive for better health outcomes,"" Dr. David Krulak, director of the Tricare Health Plan at the DHA, said in a statement May 7. ""The data we get from this demonstration will inform future Tricare innovations nationwide.""

Atlanta previously served as a test bed for a three-year Tricare Prime pilot run by Humana and Kaiser Permanente, the nonprofit considered to be a pioneer in health maintenance organization programs.

That program, which ended in 2022, sought to determine whether the DHA could provide ""value-based care"" -- a health system that pays providers based on performance, quality and value as opposed to volume.

Atlanta was home to the Army's Fort McPherson until 2011 when it was closed as part of the Pentagon's 2005 Base Realignment and Closure effort. When it closed, nearly 30,000 military retirees and their families lived in the area, and Georgia has become an increasingly popular retirement state for military personnel.

Tampa is the home of U.S. Central Command and MacDill Air Force Base, with roughly 34,000 military dependents and 133,000 retirees, according to Defense Department data.

Interested patients will be able to enroll in the new Tricare Prime option during open season, which runs from early November through early December. During open season, beneficiaries can switch between Tricare programs such as Prime or Select or unique plans offered in various locations.

CareSource is a managed-care and health insurance organization that provides programs and services to 2 million people. After receiving the Tricare Prime program contract last November, the company's chief executive officer said the new programs are intended to increase access to care for Tricare Prime beneficiaries and provide personalized support.

""We are honored to be entrusted with this vital responsibility,"" CareSource CEO Erhardt Preitauer said in a statement. ""Our team is dedicated to delivering a health plan that will provide military families with access to high-quality care that is uniquely tailored to their needs.""

Families of active-duty personnel who use Tricare Prime pay no annual enrollment fees, cost-shares or copayments. Retirees and their family members on Tricare Prime pay an annual enrollment fee, which, for most retirees, was $372 for an individual and $744 for a family in 2025.

Those beneficiaries also pay a $25 copay for a primary care visit, $38 per specialty care or urgent care visit, and $77 for an emergency room visit.

Defense Department spokesman Peter Graves said that the new programs are in addition to the Tricare health care programs already available in both cities, including existing military treatment facilities as well as Tricare Prime and Select managed by Humana.

Tricare Prime is not available to retirees and family members ages 65 and older who use Tricare For Life and Medicare.

Regular dental care for children supports not only their oral health, but their overall well-being.","MAY 14, 2025 – Did you know that oral health has important links to your overall health? That’s why it’s especially important that children get proper dental care from an early age. This helps them maintain healthy teeth and gums throughout their lives.

Luckily, the TRICARE Dental Program, administered by United Concordia, has you covered. The TDP provides dental health for eligible children of service members, helping your children access important dental care.

“The TDP provides essential coverage for children from age 1 through early adulthood,” said U.S. Air Force Col. Linda Coates, Chief, TRICARE Dental Program Branch. “It ensures your child has access to high-quality dental care that helps establish healthy habits early.”

Automatic enrollment at age 1

The TDP automatically enrolls your child in your dental plan when they turn age 1, if there’s a family member currently enrolled. This enrollment takes effect on the first day of the month following your child’s birthday.

It’s important to be proactive with your child’s oral health in the early stages. Bring your child to their first dental appointment after their first tooth appears, but no later than their first birthday. Most babies’ teeth start to grow in at around 4 to 6 months old.

If you had a single plan before your child turned 1, your premium will change from the single plan rate to the family plan rate when your child is enrolled.

Costs

Your TDP monthly premiums are based on your sponsor’s status, rank and your enrollment type. Enrollment types include:

Sponsor only

Single enrollment (one family member, not sponsor)

Family enrollment (more than one family member, not sponsor)

Sponsor and family

Your cost-shares depend on your sponsor’s pay grade and where you live.

Coverage duration

Children can keep their TDP coverage until the end of the month they turn 23 if they:

Are unmarried

Attend an approved institution of higher education full-time

Get at least half their financial support from their military sponsor

If your child stops meeting any of these conditions before turning 23, their coverage ends at the end of the month the change occurs. Additionally, if your child doesn’t meet these conditions at age 21, they’ll lose TRICARE coverage.

Services covered by TDP

The TDP covers a wide range of dental services for children, as described in the TRICARE Dental Program Handbook:

Regular checkups and cleanings

X-rays and evaluations

Fluoride treatments

Sealants for cavity prevention

Fillings and restorations

Orthodontics (braces) when medically necessary

Emergency dental care

Most children can receive two routine teeth cleanings and two topical fluoride applications every 12 months. Your dentist can recommend the right schedule for your child’s needs.

Service frequency

The TDP provides coverage based on the following timeframes:

Every 12 months:

Two oral checkups

One set of bitewing X-rays

Two routine cleanings

Two fluoride applications

Every 36 months:

One full mouth X-ray

Sealants on permanent molars through age 18

Finding a dentist

To find a CONUS dentist, search the United Concordia network. If you’re overseas, use the OCONUS Find a Dentist tool.

Using military dental clinics

In the U.S., family members normally can’t get care at military dental clinics. But in certain situations, they may. These situations include:

Emergencies

Certain special dental cases in children

Dental work related to treatment received at a military hospital or clinic

Your family members may be able to use overseas military dental clinics if they have space available. Check with your local overseas military dental clinic to find out what services they offer.

U.S. Public Health Service Rear Adm. Denise Hinton, deputy U.S.","Champions in military medicine were honored during the annual Henry Jackson Foundation’s Heroes of Military Medicine awards ceremony held on May 8, 2025, at the Washington National Cathedral in Washington, D.C.

The awards recognized outstanding contributions by senior leaders, medical professionals, and civilians who distinguished themselves through excellence and dedication to advancing military medicine and enhancing the lives and health of our nation’s wounded, ill, and injured service members, veterans, their families, and civilians, according to the foundation.

“The Military Health System is no doubt recognized as a world-class medical force, “ said Dr. Stephen Ferrara, Acting Assistant Secretary of Defense for Health Affairs, in his opening remarks. “Medical readiness is combat readiness. This is not just a slogan—it is a reality. A force that is not medically ready is a force that is not mission ready. Taking care of our warfighters will always be our number one priority.”

Medical professionals from the U.S. Army, U.S. Navy, U.S. Air Force, and U.S. Public Health Service received awards, as well as an ambassador and a civilian provider.

“There are many heroes in the Military Health System that take care of patients daily all over the world, support the readiness of the force, spend hours in research in many aspects of our systems too numerous to mention, and we have the opportunity to recognize the best of the best,” said Ferrara.

U.S. Army Honoree: U.S. Army Col. (Dr.) Benjamin Donham

Donham is currently the commander of the U.S. Army Medical Department Activity-Alaska. Before his current assignment, he served at the Carl R. Darnall Army Medical Center, Fort Cavazos, Texas; and at Fort Bragg, N.C., as commander of the 261st Multifunctional Medical Battalion and command surgeon for XVIII Airborne Corps.

Donham recognized his family for their dedication and sacrifice for his military career. “I get to do what I love because of their sacrifice, their patience, and their unwavering support. I share this recognition,” said Donham. “To the soldiers, sailors, airmen, and Marines I've served with, your shared sense of mission and purpose continues to make the journey work.”

U.S. Army Lt. Gen. Mary Izaguirre, U.S. Army surgeon general, said Col. Donham has served as a battlefield surgeon, a combat veteran, a special forces operator, scholar, commander, and pioneer in military medical innovation. “His contributions go so far beyond his operational excellence,” she said.

U.S. Navy Honoree: U.S. Navy Capt. (Dr.) Matthew Tadlock

As a trauma and general surgeon with 23 years of active duty experience, Tadlock currently serves as the officer in charge, Surface Medical Group-Pacific, where he prepares fleet surgical teams for deployment on U.S. Navy amphibious assault ships.

Since 2021, he’s led the Maritime Surgery Quality Improvement program, an initiative focused on tracking, improving, and standardizing all surgical care performed on U.S. combatant vessels. He is also an attending surgeon at Naval Medical Center San Diego and an associate professor of surgery through the Uniformed Services University.

U.S. Navy Rear Adm. Walter Brafford, commander, Naval Medical Forces Development Command, commended Tadlock, saying, “Under immense threat and pressure, often far from traditional medical facilities, Capt. Tadlock has relied not just on his own exceptional skills as a trauma and critical care specialist, but through his visionary leadership in shaping the very landscape of how we prepare and sustain our operational medical teams.”

“He doesn’t just maintain the status quo; he forges a new path.”

Tadlock thanked his family and fellow military medical professionals, saying, “Many of the accomplishments that led to this recognition, myself, or others, started at the grassroots level. To be recognized for being a part of these grassroots efforts and to see some of them become how we do business is incredibly rewarding.”

U.S. Air Force Honoree: U.S. Air Force Col. (Dr.) Daniel Brown

“Every single success in military medicine is a shared achievement,” Brown said. “Especially true in the care and transport of those injured, a mission that has helped shape my career.”

Brown is an emergency services master clinician at Wright-Patterson Medical Center, Wright-Patterson Air Force Base, Ohio, where he serves as the senior advisor to a 90-person emergency services flight and directs clinical operations for 13,000 emergency patients per year.

U.S. Air Force Brig. Gen. Jason Lennen, director of policy and resources at the Office of the Surgeon General, U.S. Air Force, told the audience, “Col. Brown's profound impact will be forever felt by the patients and staff he has directly touched, as well as the county centers that were built with the firm foundation that he has led to treat, heal and save, to enable our Air Force to fly, fight and win, and our joint force to deter, defend and defeat.”

U.S. Public Health Service Honoree: USPHS Capt. (Dr.) John Iskander

Iskander, currently assigned to the Food and Drug Administration, most recently served as chief of the immunization healthcare division for the Defense Health Agency and previously was chief of preventive medicine and population health for the U.S. Coast Guard.

U.S. Public Health Service Rear Adm. Denise Hinton, deputy U.S. Surgeon General, said Iskander, “is a distinguished leader whose contributions have profoundly advanced military and veteran medicine.”

“His career has been defined by excellence in clinical care, his groundbreaking medical research, and an unwavering dedication to those who serve as a physician leader within the United States Public Health Service Commission Corps.”

Iskander thanked those in attendance for the recognition for his service to the USPHS and emphasized the importance of the work of the agency, saying, “It is my privilege to accept this award with thanks to all my fellow United States Public Health Service officers who have and continue to serve our warfighters and veterans.”

Civilian Provider Honoree: Dr. Troy Akers

Akers is the civilian chief of emergency medicine at Dwight D. Eisenhower Army Medical Center, a position he transitioned into following his military retirement in 2018.

Dr. David Smith, acting director, Defense Health Agency, introduced Akers and talked about his heroic efforts in the aftermath of Hurricane Helene in 2024 that ravaged many communities in Georgia, including the area that relies on the Eisenhower Army Medical Center for medical care.

In the immediate hours of the destruction resulting from the storm, Smith said Akers went to the center and quickly began to respond to the needs of the community, patients, and his staff.

“This is what leadership is in crisis,” said Smith. “These are the actions of an individual who captures all the qualities we seek in our line of work: calmness, confidence, and compassion for those they serve.”

Akers said his job is “to make sure that the men and women that wear that uniform—the most precious resources this country has—have everything they need to make sure that they can fight America's wars, taking care of their family members when they're deployed, making sure they're medically ready, has been the honor of my life, and I thank every single day I get to do this job.”

Ambassador Honoree: Sal Gonzalez

Gonzalez enlisted in the Marines in 2004 and was assigned to the 2nd Battalion. While serving in Iraq, his vehicle was hit by an improvised explosive device, leaving him with a traumatic brain injury, post-traumatic stress disorder, and a below-the-knee amputation.

While recovering from his injuries, he was introduced to many programs that offer rehabilitation and recovery of injured service members, including music. Since, he has performed at the Grand Ole’ Opry in Nashville, Tennessee, and is about to release his first full-length album.

He “turned his healing journey into a mission, proving that music can give bridge to recovery, resilience, and renew purpose,” said Joseph Caravalho, president and CEO of the Henry M. Jackson Foundation for the Advancement of Military Medicine.

Gonzalez told the audience, “The only reason I am alive today is because of people like those who are being honored tonight. Because if I had been injured as grievously as I was injured in Iraq, just a couple of decades before—I do not think I would have survived.”",https://health.mil/-/media/Images/MHS/DVIDS/Articles/news497926.jpg?sc_lang=en&hash=712C466D03B7905495790168A86A456BB67021D7,N,1.0,2025-05-14 15:57:00.490484

With options like VA coverage, Tricare, and Medicare, the decision-making process can often feel complicated and confusing. That’s why Jordan Shears and Bashir Gray of Informed Choice Insurance joined us recently to shed light on this important topic.

Do Veterans Need Medicare If They Have VA or Tricare?

While VA and Tricare are both highly comprehensive, they may not cover every situation. According to Jordan Shears and Bashir Gray, Medicare provides a broader scope, especially when it comes to accessing doctors outside of the VA network. This can be especially beneficial for veterans who want more flexibility in their healthcare choices.

Are There Risks in Adding a Medicare Advantage Plan?

Bashir Gray clarifies that there aren’t necessarily “risks,” but there are important considerations. VA plans often come with smaller, more restrictive networks, while Medicare Advantage plans open the door to a wide range of civilian healthcare providers. For veterans who face long wait times or live far from a VA facility, this expanded access can make a significant difference.

Do Veterans Have to Go to a VA Hospital?

Absolutely not. As Jordan Shears explains, veterans are not limited to VA hospitals. Medicare Advantage plans can help bridge the gap by providing more convenient care options, especially for those who may live 30 to 40 minutes—or more—from the nearest VA location.

Why Informed Choice Specializes in Veteran Coverage

The team at Informed Choice Insurance has been working with Medicare clients for years. Their mission goes beyond selling insurance—they act as advocates, helping clients navigate the often confusing world of private healthcare. Whether it’s filing a claim or dealing with complicated paperwork, Bashir and Jordan aim to make the process easier and less stressful.

As the segment noted, the Veterans Administration is one of the most underfunded departments in the U.S. government. That makes the role of informed insurance experts even more valuable. Working with professionals who truly understand the process can help veterans cut through red tape and get the support they need faster.

I called the hospital and got the cash cost estimate of ~41k per treatment.
How is it that its IMPOSSIBLE for them to give me a cost estimate.
Does anyone have experience getting their MS treatment covered by Tricare?
Specifically Tricare Select?","Good morning everyone, I was diagnosed last month and am supposed to be getting my first Ocrevus treatment next month. This is the first time using my insurance for anything significant and I have some questions, specifically about Tricare Reserve Select if anyone has this same insurance. For reference, I am currently in the Army Reserves.

In talking to my neurologist, she said she has patients with the same insurance and that ""Tricare pays for ocrevus"". I trust her but I wanted to verify. I called the hospital and got the cash cost estimate of ~41k per treatment. I first checked the Tricare Formulary for the prescription benefit, it stated that ocrevus is not a covered prescription but that it may be covered under the medical benefit. I then called Tricare, they did confirm that my approved treatment authorization had it covered under the medical benefit. I then asked ""what exactly is covered and what sort of charges can I expect on the day of treatment?"" They said it would be the cost of an in-network specialty visit ($32), but when I pressed on if the ocrevus itself would be completely covered they said, ""We cant know that till after the treatment"". That sounded ridiculous to me so I asked for a supervisor. The supervisor said they would get a cost estimate for me and put me on hold for a loooooooong time and eventually came back with ""We cant know that till after the treatment"". I repeated this process again a couple days later thinking maybe I got someone on their bad day but got the same answer. How is that the answer? How is it that its IMPOSSIBLE for them to give me a cost estimate.

Granted I am pretty inexperienced with insurance and its sure not very straightforward but I can read and have read through the Explanation of Benefits for my tricare plan. I cant quite get a warm and fuzzy about what I am walking into cost wise. Does anyone have experience getting their MS treatment covered by Tricare? Specifically Tricare Select? Please educate if you have a moment. Any insight would be greatly appreciated.",,N,0.0,2025-05-14 15:57:11.820932

Senator Hawley wrote, “I write with great concern over reports that the Defense Health Agency (DHA) is considering downgrading the General Leonard Wood Army Community Hospital to a clinic. I urge you to reconsider this and ensure that Fort Leonard Wood keeps its newly built hospital.”

He continued, “As you are no doubt aware, the DHA also moved to downgrade Fort Leonard Wood’s hospital under the previous Administration.

Senator Hawley concluded, “The DHA has previously considered downgrading this hospital as a cost savings measure, but in point of fact such a move would represent the abandonment of over $400 million in recent investments to upgrade Fort Leonard Wood’s medical facilities. It would also impose additional costs on servicemembers assigned to Fort Leonard Wood, who would have to travel long distances to receive anything more than outpatient services. A downgrade of this facility should not happen. I urge you to reconsider and reverse any determinations that have been made to do so.

Dear Dr. Smith,

I write with great concern over reports that the Defense Health Agency (DHA) is considering downgrading the General Leonard Wood Army Community Hospital to a clinic. I urge you to reconsider this and ensure that Fort Leonard Wood keeps its newly built hospital.

As you are no doubt aware, the DHA also moved to downgrade Fort Leonard Wood’s hospital under the previous Administration. I demanded Secretary Austin reverse course then, and have continued to remain engaged on the issue.

Downgrading this hospital would seriously harm soldiers, their families, and the broader community. It would jeopardize Fort Leonard Wood’s critical role as a major Army training center, including for Basic Combat Training and numerous advanced specialties.

The DHA has previously considered downgrading this hospital as a cost savings measure, but in point of fact such a move would represent the abandonment of over $400 million in recent investments to upgrade Fort Leonard Wood’s medical facilities. It would also impose additional costs on servicemembers assigned to Fort Leonard Wood, who would have to travel long distances to receive anything more than outpatient services.

A downgrade of this facility should not happen. I urge you to reconsider and reverse any determinations that have been made to do so. You must act to protect a hospital that is critical to servicemembers and constituents in my state.

Sincerely,

Josh Hawley

Congresswoman Marilyn Strickland (WA-10) is leading a bipartisan push to improve maternal health care for military families through expanded access to midwifery services. In recognition of the International Day of the Midwife, Strickland reintroduced the MIDWIVES for Servicemembers Act, a bill aimed at broadening maternity care options for servicemembers and their families enrolled in TRICARE.

“It is our job to support our servicemembers, and this includes providing help before, during and after childbirth,” said Strickland. “This bill expands midwifery care options, giving servicemembers and their families the care that they deserve.”

The legislation, co-led by Reps. Emily Randall (WA-06), Juan Ciscomani (AZ-06), and Jen Kiggans (VA-02), reflects a bipartisan commitment to expanding maternity care options for military families.

The proposed bill creates a five-year pilot program within TRICARE to cover services provided by credentialed midwives, with the goal of making that coverage permanent.

“Sexual and reproductive health care is essential, and we have a responsibility to ensure that service members and their families can access the care they deserve,” said Randall. “Expanding midwifery services through TRICARE is a critical step toward closing the dangerous gaps in maternal health care that too many people — especially those who serve our nation — are forced to navigate.”

The legislation has received endorsements from major national organizations including the American Association of Birth Centers, American College of Nurse Midwives, and the National Association of Certified Professional Midwives (NACPM), among others. Advocates emphasize that the bill will help meet the growing demand for community-based maternal care and support military families in underserved areas.

“The MIDWIVES for Servicemembers Act directly addresses a critical gap in maternity care for military families by expanding TRICARE to include all credentialed midwives. By recognizing Certified Professional Midwives and Certified Midwives as authorized providers, this bill not only increases access to care, especially in underserved areas, but also affirms the right of military families to choose safe community-based care,” said Cassaundra Jah, Executive Director of NACPM. “With over half of U.S. birth centers staffed by CPMs, this legislation will dramatically expand access to midwifery-led birth center services. NACPM strongly supports this bill as a meaningful, evidence-based solution that honors the dignity, autonomy, and well-being of our nation’s servicemembers and their families.”

Ciscomani, a father of six, spoke to the unique challenges faced by military families during pregnancy and childbirth.

“As our troops and their families serve our nation, they deserve access to the very best care, especially if they are looking to start or expand their family,” said Ciscomani. “As a dad of six I can tell you, planning to welcome a child to your family is an exciting time. However, serving in the military or having a spouse in uniform can pose additional difficulties for mothers-to-be. This is why I once again joined Rep. Strickland in a bipartisan effort to expand access to midwifery care for military spouses and women in uniform who are enrolled in TRICARE to ensure they can receive the care they need.”

Kiggans, a Navy veteran and former nurse practitioner, emphasized the importance of improving health outcomes for military families while easing the burden on the military health system.

“As a Navy veteran and former nurse practitioner, I know firsthand the importance of high-quality, accessible maternal care for our military families,” said Kiggans. “The MIDWIVES for Service Members Act is a commonsense, data-driven solution that expands care options under TRICARE, improves outcomes for mothers and babies, and helps reduce strain on military healthcare systems. I’m proud to help lead this bipartisan effort to better support those who serve by delivering the care they and their families deserve.”",https://seattlemedium.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/local-pic-Marilyn-Strickland-Official-Photo_0.jpg,N,1.0,2025-05-14 12:57:05.318033

The company will celebrate on social media, sharing patient and provider stories that highlight the impact NeuroStar has as a safe, effective, and non-drug treatment for depression

MALVERN, Pa., May 14, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Neuronetics, Inc. (NASDAQ: STIM), a vertically integrated, commercial stage, medical technology and healthcare company with a strategic vision of transforming the lives of patients whenever and wherever they need help, with the leading neurohealth therapies in the world, is proud to launch the first National TMS Therapy Awareness Day. The event will take place each year on May 14 during May's Mental Health Awareness Month. This day is dedicated to raising awareness of transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) as a proven, non-drug treatment option for individuals living with major depressive disorder (MDD), depression with anxiety, and OCD, especially those who have not found relief through antidepressants.

""National TMS Awareness Day is about giving hope to people who haven't found relief and being a driving force in the National Mental Health Awareness conversation,” said Keith Sullivan, President and Chief Executive Officer of Neuronetics. ""Far too many individuals feel stuck or discouraged after trying multiple antidepressants without receiving adequate relief from their symptoms. By launching this National Day, we want to raise awareness that non-medication approaches like NeuroStar TMS therapy exist-and they're helping real people reclaim their lives. Our goal is to make sure every patient, caregiver, and provider knows that effective, non-drug treatments are available and within reach.”

Transcranial magnetic stimulation was first cleared by the FDA in 2008 for treatment-resistant depression in adults. Since then, it has become a widely adopted, evidence-backed modality for those who haven't responded to medication intervention. NeuroStar is the leading TMS therapy in the United States-and in 2024, NeuroStar also received FDA clearance for use in adolescents, expanding access to younger patients in need of non-drug treatment options. Over 300 million people have insurance plans that cover NeuroStar TMS therapy, including Medicare and Tricare.

""One of the reasons NeuroStar is the leading TMS therapy is the precision of our technology,” said Geoffrey Grammer, MD, Chief Medical Officer of Neuronetics. ""Our unique coil design is built to deliver focused magnetic pulses exactly where they're needed. Combined with our Contact Sensing feature, this ensures every session is both consistent and effective, helping patients get the most out of their treatment. We take pride in our scientific and engineering rigor, which continues to advance the field of TMS therapy and enhance the lives of our patients. On National TMS Therapy Awareness Day, we celebrate the real-world impact of NeuroStar TMS Therapy and the difference it makes.”

Kristen Gingrich, a licensed clinical social worker, mother, and patient advocate, has documented her experience with NeuroStar TMS after struggling with depression since her teens-worsened by postpartum challenges. After trying talk therapy and multiple antidepressants without lasting relief, she turned to NeuroStar TMS and is now sharing her treatment journey during Mental Health Awareness Month. Kristen's story, which can be seen on both her account (@notyouraveragethrpst) and NeuroStar social media channels, helps shine a light about non-drug options and inspire others facing similar struggles to seek help.

In addition to founding this awareness day, NeuroStar TMS continues its legacy as the leading TMS device company by presenting data at the 2025 American Psychiatric Association Annual Meeting (May 17-21). The poster ""The Profile of Symptom Change with Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation for Major Depressive Disorder” builds on prior research and evaluates TMS protocols and their treatment efficacy.

Combined with our Contact Sensing feature, this ensures every session is both consistent and effective, helping patients get the most out of their treatment. We take pride in our scientific and engineering rigor, which continues to advance the field of TMS therapy and enhance the lives of our patients. On National TMS Therapy Awareness Day, we celebrate the real-world impact of NeuroStar TMS Therapy and the difference it makes.”

Kristen Gingrich, a licensed clinical social worker, mother, and patient advocate, has documented her experience with NeuroStar TMS after struggling with depression since her teens—worsened by postpartum challenges. After trying talk therapy and multiple antidepressants without lasting relief, she turned to NeuroStar TMS and is now sharing her treatment journey during Mental Health Awareness Month. Kristen’s story, which can be seen on both her account (@notyouraveragethrpst) and NeuroStar social media channels, helps shine a light about non-drug options and inspire others facing similar struggles to seek help.

In addition to founding this awareness day, NeuroStar TMS continues its legacy as the leading TMS device company by presenting data at the 2025 American Psychiatric Association Annual Meeting (May 17-21). The poster “The Profile of Symptom Change with Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation for Major Depressive Disorder” builds on prior research and evaluates TMS protocols and their treatment efficacy.

The Pentagon has officially halted gender-affirming care for active duty military personnel in accordance with an executive order from President Trump that demands the firing of any member of the United States military who has received a diagnosis of, or treatment for, gender dysphoria, according to Reuters.

The memo seen by Reuters is alleged to have “barred any new hormone treatments as well as any surgical procedures for transgender troops,” even though TRICARE, the healthcare provider for active duty military personnel in America, has long refused to cover gender-affirming surgeries in most cases.

Stephen Ferrara, acting assistant Secretary of Defense for Health Affairs, is alleged to have instructed in the memo that the recipients “immediately implement this guidance.” When asked for comment, the Pentagon directed Reuters to speak with the Defense Health Agency, who facilitate healthcare services for the armed forces. The DHA had not responded to Reuters’ request for comment before publication.

This news comes on the heels of another memo Reuters obtained last week in which Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth demanded that the Pentagon start forcibly separating active duty transgender troops who had not left on their own by June 6. Troops in the armed forces reserves had until July 7th to voluntarily separate. On this memo, too, the Pentagon provided no comment. Hegseth simply tweeted, “No More Trans @ DoD.”

According to Reuters, officials have estimated that there are 4,240 transgender troops in the US military. This figure is somewhat contentious: activists defending trans rights often estimate higher, and in 2018 the now defunct Palm Center UCSB think tank estimated that there were 14,707 transgender Americans serving in the armed forces; 8,980 active duty, and another 5,727 in the reserves. There are approximately 2.86 million military personnel in the United States, meaning even the highest estimates of transgender troops account for less than half of one percent of all troops. How such a small minority could possibly compromise military readiness, as the Trump administration insists they do, is unclear.

The battle over transgender troops has been waged in federal courts since Trump’s executive order was issued in January, with two separate federal judges issuing sweeping pauses on the separation of transgender troops from the military. Unfortunately, last week the Supreme Court rubber stamped a request from the Trump administration to let them carry on firing transgender military personnel and denying them healthcare, and determine the constitutionality of that maneuver at a later date. The issued approval was one page, provided no explanation of the conservative justices’ rationale, and noted that the progressive judges dissented.

This is just the latest move in Trump’s war on inclusivity in the military. Over the weekend, leaders at the Pentagon were instructed to identify and remove materials that promote “divisive concepts and gender ideology.”

It’s unclear exactly how these separations will be processed, and whether or not transgender troops who are separated from the military, involuntarily or otherwise, will retain access to benefits such as the GI Bill or VA healthcare. In particular, new guidance on trans healthcare at the VA last month declared that no new patients for gender dysphoria treatment would be accepted, but that active duty troops accessing gender affirming-care through TRICARE who then separated from the military and qualified for care through the VA would be eligible to transition their treatment plan to the VA. The Pentagon has provided no answers on whether or not these rules are still in place, so eager are they to purge transgender Americans from military service.

Whatever you think about our armed forces, I find it deeply upsetting that thousands of trans people will be unemployed, homeless and possibly without healthcare in the next 30 to 60 days. Discrimination against trans people in housing and employment is on the rise, after all. Besides that, I simply cannot stomach the notion of transgender Americans being systematically excluded from any group that cisgender Americans have free access to; this is, it should go without saying, one of the first steps down a very scary road.

We’ve lost this battle. I hope we can win the war.",http://static1.squarespace.com/static/633303d5ccf756402b93f25c/t/68243c21f9c8016586004746/1747205153545/671ac29ac65b23.00193110.png?format=1500w,N,-1.0,2025-05-14 06:56:21.985636

The 81st Medical Group on Keesler Air Force Base, Miss., the 673rd Medical Group on Joint Base Elmendorf-Richardson, Alaska, and Brooke Army Medical Center on Joint Base San Antonio-Fort Sam Houston, Texas, are among the 16 military hospitals that received top honors for their excellence in transparency and delivery of safe, high-quality care.

The Leapfrog Group is a national, independent organization focused on health care quality. The organization evaluates hospitals on a wide range of safety measures, including errors, injuries, and infections, as well as the safety and quality programs in place to prevent patient harm.

A hospital must meet specific criteria to be eligible for participation in the Leapfrog safety assessment. In the spring 2025 ratings, 32% of participating hospitals nationwide received the highest grade. Of the eligible military hospitals participating in the grading assessment, 73% received an ""A"" grade, according to a DHA release.

KEESLER KUDOS

This year marks Keesler Medical Center’s second consecutive year on Leapfrog’s “honor roll.”

The 81st Medical Group maintains medical readiness for worldwide contingencies by providing quality, cost-effective health care for more than 27,000 enrollees, including almost 7,500 active-duty members. It also oversees five military treatment facilities from Mobile, Alabama, to New Orleans, Louisiana, coordinating care for 80,000 beneficiaries along the Gulf Coast.

“This accomplishment marks a significant milestone for our hospital,” said Air Force Col. Peter Kulis, commander of the 81st Medical Group and director of Keesler Medical Center. “Patient safety is at the heart of everything we do — from the smallest interaction to the most critical decisions. I’m deeply proud of our team, whose commitment and excellence ensure our patients receive the safest, highest-quality care possible.”

NORTHERN STARS

This year marks JBER’s third consecutive time scoring an “A” grade.

JBER hospital, fondly known as “J-Bear,” is a joint venture between the Department of Defense and Veterans Affairs that offers primary, specialty, outpatient, and inpatient care to 25,000 enrolled beneficiaries in the Anchorage area.

“Our third consecutive ‘A’ grade from Leapfrog is a direct reflection of the relentless commitment our Airmen and staff demonstrate every day to patient safety, high-reliability practices, and mission-ready care,” said Air Force Col. Laura Baugh, 673rd Medical Group commander. “This recognition belongs to the 673rd Medical Group team, whose discipline and dedication continue to set the standard for military medicine.”

BAMC BRILLIANCE

Brooke Army Medical Center also made the spring “honor roll.”

BAMC is the largest and most robust military hospital and the only Level I Trauma Center within the Department of Defense, providing safe, quality care to service members, their families, veterans, and civilian emergency patients.

BAMC serves more than 250,000 military beneficiaries within San Antonio and the surrounding communities. As a Level I Trauma Center, BAMC administers lifesaving care to civilian emergency patients from across 22 counties in Southwest Texas.

“BAMC is committed to providing our patients the best quality and safest care possible, and these results exemplify that commitment,” said Army Col. Kevin Kelly, BAMC commander. “We are very proud of this extraordinary accomplishment.”

Along with assessing patient safety measures, Leapfrog participation is also intended to foster transparency with patients and the public. Additionally, military hospitals can use the data to measure and compare their performance to other participating hospitals and healthcare systems, leading to continual process improvement.

Did Zynex Deceive Investors with Inflated Revenue Figures? Lawsuit Alleges Misleading Practices

The lawsuit contends that Zynex engaged in a scheme to inflate its reported revenue by routinely sending patients more products, including electrodes, than were medically necessary. This practice, the suit alleges, drew scrutiny from insurers, most notably Tricare, the health care program for active-duty and retired U.S. military personnel, potentially leading to adverse consequences such as removal from insurer networks and government penalties.

Concerns surrounding Zynex's business practices were amplified on June 4, 2024, with the publication of a report in the medical journal STAT. The report, titled ""How a device maker inundated pain patients with unwanted batteries and surprise bills,"" detailed what it described as an ""oversupplying scheme"" whereby Zynex allegedly sent excessive monthly supplies, such as electrode pads and batteries, to generate higher billings to insurers. Following the publication of the STAT report, Zynex's stock price reportedly fell by more than 5 percent.

The lawsuit further highlights Zynex's disclosure on March 11, 2025, when the company announced its financial results for the fourth quarter and full year of 2024. In its report, Zynex revealed a significant revenue shortfall in the fourth quarter, attributed to slower payments from certain payers. The company also disclosed that Tricare had temporarily suspended payments while it reviewed prior claims. This announcement triggered a sharp decline in Zynex's share price, plummeting by more than 51 percent, according to the legal filing.

Tricare Suspension Exacerbates Financial Woes: Post-Lawsuit Report Reveals Deepening Revenue and Profit Decline.

The financial repercussions of the Tricare payment suspension and the alleged prior practices became more evident after the lawsuit was filed. On April 29, 2025, Zynex reported a substantial decline in its first-quarter 2025 financial performance. Net revenue for the quarter plummeted to $26.6 million, a sharp decrease from the $46.5 million reported in the same period of 2024. The company also saw its gross profit margin contract significantly, falling to 69 percent in the first quarter of 2025 compared to 80 percent in the prior year. This downturn resulted in an adjusted EBITDA loss of $11.8 million for the quarter, a stark contrast to the $1.7 million in adjusted EBITDA recorded in the first quarter of 2024.

During the subsequent earnings call, Zynex Chief Executive Officer Thomas Sandgaard directly addressed the TriCare payment suspension as a primary factor contributing to the disappointing first-quarter results. Mr. Sandgaard stated that the disruption had a significant impact on revenue calculations and prompted the company to initiate a restructuring effort to prepare for a potential prolonged halt in TriCare payments.

Looking ahead, Zynex has issued a muted revenue guidance of $27 million for the second quarter of 2025 and anticipates an earnings per share (EPS) loss of $0.20. Reflecting the considerable uncertainty surrounding its relationship with TriCare, a key payer, the company has withheld its full-year financial guidance.

Hagens Berman's Launches Inquiry into Zynex's Disclosures Amidst Financial Turmoil

Shareholder rights law firm Hagens Berman has announced an inquiry into the circumstances surrounding Zynex's recent financial disclosures and the allegations leveled in the class-action suit.

""Our investigation seeks to determine whether the company sufficiently revealed the potential pitfalls inherent in its billing methodologies and its dependence on TriCare's financial contributions,"" said Reed Kathrein, the partner spearheading the firm's probe.

That number is even higher for those who are serving or have served in the U.S. military, often due to the stress and trauma that service members endure.

If you are a military member or retiree, you and your family may be eligible for TRICARE, which covers many mental heath services. You do not have to suffer with mental health issues alone. Help is available.

What Is TRICARE?

TRICARE, a program of the United States Department of Defense Military Health System, provides civilian health benefits for military members, retirees, and their dependents. TRICARE offers several plan options depending on eligibility, but active military members are eligible for TRICARE Prime, which comes with few out of pocket costs.

Why Mental Health Services Matter

Often, people hesitate to seek mental health care, in part because of the stigma of mental illness. However, it’s important to recognize that people with mental health issues are not weak or defective. They simply suffer from a disorder that many other people also struggle with, and those disorders are treatable. With treatment, people with mental health disorders can get better and feel better and live more fulfilling lives. No one should suffer in silence when help is never more than a phone call away.

TRICARE Plan Options

TRICARE has seven main plan options.

TRICARE Prime: Prime is offered to active military members and their families and has the lowest out of pocket costs compared to other plans. It is similar to a health maintenance organization (HMO) plan and features the use of military hospitals and clinics.

TRICARE Select: Select is similar to a preferred provider organization (PPO) plan and allows you to choose your TRICARE providers. However, out of pocket costs with this plan are higher.

US Family Plan: The family plan is only available in certain areas and covers care only by their authorized providers. Care at military hospitals and clinics is not covered.

TRICARE Reserve Select: This plan is premium based and covers care with TRICARE authorized providers. It is available to Selected Reserve members and their families.

TRICARE Retired Reserve: Available to members of the Retired Reserve, this plan is similar to TRICARE Reserve Select.

TRICARE Young Adult: A premium based plan for young adult children of eligible military members. Prime or Select coverage may be chosen.

TRICARE For Life: A plan that supplements Medicare coverage.

Outpatient Mental Health Services Covered

Outpatient services are available at some military facilities and through TRICARE authorized providers. Some common outpatient services that are covered include:

Psychological testing and assessment

Psychotherapy

Intensive Outpatient Programs (IOPs) – Therapy several times per week

Partial Hospitalization Programs (PHPs) – Daytime treatment, six or more hours a day, up to seven days a week

Inpatient Services Covered

Inpatient services covered include:

Inpatient hospital services for psychiatric emergencies and substance abuse withdrawal

Psychiatric residential treatment centers for children and adolescents

Mental Health Emergency Services

In the case of a mental health emergency, emergency room visits are covered as long as you contact TRICARE within 72 hours of admission. You can also call 988, the Veterans Crisis Line.

Common Mental Health Disorders Among Veterans

The most common mental health disorders among veterans are post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), depression, anxiety, and substance use disorders.

PTSD is generally caused by one or more traumatic events that occurred while serving. Active duty service members often live through traumatic events, which is why nearly 25% of veterans who are cared for by VA services have had PTSD at some point in their lives. Symptoms of PTSD include flashbacks, severe anxiety, nightmares, and uncontrollable thoughts about the traumatic event or events.

Depression often occurs due to feelings of isolation after transitioning back to civilian life. Symptoms of depression include loss of interest in activities, persistent sadness, difficulty concentrating, and changes in appetite.

Anxiety is often caused by being consistently exposed to stressful situations while in service. Symptoms include constant worrying, restlessness, nervousness, difficulty concentrating, and rapid heartbeat.

Substance use disorders, which include alcohol and drug use disorders, are common as well, and often co-occur with other common mental health disorders among veterans. Bridges of Hope is a TRICARE authorized provider offering several treatment options for substance use disorders.

This list is not all-inclusive, so if you are suffering with symptoms that don’t fit these disorders, you should still seek mental health care. Everyone responds differently to the extreme stress and trauma associated with military service, so reach out for help no matter what you’re struggling with.

,,2025-05-13 23:42:59+00:00,Women's eNews,She Was Here: The Erasure of Women from America's Story,"Jean Kilbourne, Silvia Rodriguez Vega, Jacquese Armstrong, Yasmin Tarver",,,,,https://womensenews.org/2025/05/she-was-here-the-erasure-of-women-from-americas-story/,"Fortunately, two nonprofit organizations dedicated to telling women’s stories, the National Women’s History Museum and the National Women’s Hall of Fame, are not dependent on government funding.
The Hall will continue to tell their stories in its mission to combat the erasure of women’s contributions to the world.
In science and technology, this problem is so pervasive it has a name: the Matilda Effect—the systematic process of overlooking, miscrediting, or erasing women’s contributions to scientific achievement.
The term is named for 1995 National Women’s Hall of Fame Inductee Matilda Josyln Gage, who identified this bias as early as 1870 in her work as a suffragist and civil rights advocate.
Over three hundred women have been inducted into the Hall so far, each one with a powerful story.","On his very first day in office, President Donald Trump fired Admiral Linda Fagan, the first woman in American history to lead a branch of the armed forces. She was evicted from her residence with three hours’ notice. Weeks later, Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth fired Admiral Lisa Franchetti, the first female Chief of Naval Operations. Soon thereafter he fired Lt. Gen. Jennifer Short, the senior military assistant to the secretary of defense, and then Telita Crosland, the former head of the military’s Defense Health Agency, forced to retire after a 32-year career.

The purge didn’t stop at leadership. At the same time, the Army and Navy removed all web pages that highlighted the history and contributions of female soldiers and sailors. A page entitled “Navy Women of Courage and Intelligence” was replaced by a “Page not found” message. The Pentagon has removed many thousands of posts about and photos of female military members.

The message is clear: women in power will no longer be recognized – or even tolerated.

It is not just military women who are being erased. Hundreds of federal government websites have removed any mention of women’s achievements and words such as “women,” “female,” and “feminism.” The White House released a list of words that National Institutes of Health grant seekers may no longer use, including “women.” Trump has also ordered NASA to eradicate all mention of women in leadership from its websites. In a term straight out of Brave New World, Trump refers to these acts as “defending women.” As he said at one of his rallies, he would be a protector of women “whether they like it or not.” This is especially ironic coming from a man who has been found liable for sexual assault by a jury of his peers and has been credibly accused of sexual abuse and harassment by over two dozen women.

We are fast living in a world in which women are becoming invisible (except as sex objects or baby machines) and our achievements are being erased. While it isn’t entirely true that “you cannot be what you cannot see,” it will certainly become more difficult for girls to believe they can be anything they want to be–-and for boys to grow up respecting girls and women. “If you erase the memory, we really forget the people,” said Alessio Ponzio, a visiting professor at Memorial University of Newfoundland. “It’s an act of violence that is very subtle but can really destroy the psychology of people. Basically, ‘I’m telling you that I do not recognize you.'”

In the words of author Lydia Millet, “Storytelling will never be the same as action. But action depends on a perception of possibility, which only arises from the tales we tell ourselves.” I would add that the perception of possibility also arises from the tales we are told by others. We must fight back by telling the stories of women who have done exceptional things, often in the face of discrimination and oppression. In recent years, museums have increasingly told these stories–but museums, even ones as iconic as the Smithsonian, are now being overhauled to revert to a historical lens that leaves out the women and people of color who shaped our nation.

Women have always been almost nonexistent in public artwork. Less than seven percent of national monuments honor women. As Rebeca Solnit said in “City of Women,” “A horde of dead men . . . haunt New York City and almost every city in the Western world.”

In the spring of 2024, President Joe Biden issued an executive order instructing the National Park Service to “highlight important figures and chapters in women’s history.” “Women and girls of all backgrounds have shaped our country’s history, from the ongoing fight for justice and equality to cutting-edge scientific advancements and artistic achievements,” the announcement read. “Yet these contributions have often been overlooked. We must do more to recognize the role of women and girls in America’s story, including through the Federal Government’s recognition and interpretation of historic and cultural sites.” If you attempt to find this order on a government website, you will find “Page not found.” The Trump administration has completely undone this order and seems to be in the process of undoing the National Park Service altogether.

Fortunately, two nonprofit organizations dedicated to telling women’s stories, the National Women’s History Museum and the National Women’s Hall of Fame, are not dependent on government funding. The Museum’s “ultimate vision is a more representative history and a more collective future, ensuring women’s history is an integral part of American history.”

The mission of the Hall is to advance gender equity (a phrase removed from all government websites) through action, education, and storytelling. In spite of the name, only about ten percent of women in the Hall are famous. The overwhelming majority are women who have groundbreaking accomplishments but are most often not recognized or celebrated outside of their particular fields. Women like Oveta Culp Hobby, the first director of the Women’s Army Corps and the first female to attain the rank of United States Colonel, and Sheila Widnall, the first female Secretary of the Air Force. The Hall will continue to tell their stories in its mission to combat the erasure of women’s contributions to the world.

This epidemic of erasure isn’t new—and it isn’t limited to the current administration. Many are familiar with famous female authors writing under male pseudonyms as a workaround for gender discrimination.

In science and technology, this problem is so pervasive it has a name: the Matilda Effect—the systematic process of overlooking, miscrediting, or erasing women’s contributions to scientific achievement. The term is named for 1995 National Women’s Hall of Fame Inductee Matilda Josyln Gage, who identified this bias as early as 1870 in her work as a suffragist and civil rights advocate. Yes, 1870!

Why have most Americans never heard of Dr. Patricia Bath, the first person to develop laser cataract surgery? Or Alice Evans, a scientist whose work led to mandatory milk pasteurization, saving countless lives worldwide. Or of Elouise Cobell, a member of the Blackfeet Nation who fought for Native American rights? Or of Bessie Coleman, the first Black female aviator? Or of St. Katharine Drexel, an American-born saint who dedicated her life and fortune to aid Native Americans and Black Americans? Why isn’t Margaret Fuller, author and journalist, taught in literature classes alongside her colleagues Ralph Waldo Emerson and Nathanial Hawthorne?

Over three hundred women have been inducted into the Hall so far, each one with a powerful story. Now, more than ever, we must be sure that these stories are told. As Cecile Richards said, “Stories, told and retold, are the key to igniting change.”

So, tell them. Share them. Fund the institutions that preserve them, and refuse to let those who would erase our history win.",https://womensenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/why-womens-hall-of-fame.webp,N,0.0,2025-05-13 19:56:27.200022

The TDP provides dental health for eligible children of service members, helping your children access important dental care.
“The TDP provides essential coverage for children from age 1 through early adulthood,” said U.S. Air Force Col. Linda Coates, Chief, TRICARE Dental Program Branch.
Using military dental clinics In the U.S., family members normally can’t get care at military dental clinics.
Regular dental care for children supports not only their oral health, but their overall well-being.","Did you know that oral health has important links to your overall health? That’s why it’s especially important that children get proper dental care from an early age. This helps them maintain healthy teeth and gums throughout their lives.

Luckily, the TRICARE Dental Program, administered by United Concordia, has you covered. The TDP provides dental health for eligible children of service members, helping your children access important dental care.

“The TDP provides essential coverage for children from age 1 through early adulthood,” said U.S. Air Force Col. Linda Coates, Chief, TRICARE Dental Program Branch. “It ensures your child has access to high-quality dental care that helps establish healthy habits early.”

Automatic enrollment at age 1

The TDP automatically enrolls your child in your dental plan when they turn age 1, if there’s a family member currently enrolled. This enrollment takes effect on the first day of the month following your child’s birthday.

It’s important to be proactive with your child’s oral health in the early stages. Bring your child to their first dental appointment after their first tooth appears, but no later than their first birthday. Most babies’ teeth start to grow in at around 4 to 6 months old.

If you had a single plan before your child turned 1, your premium will change from the single plan rate to the family plan rate when your child is enrolled.

Costs

Your TDP monthly premiums are based on your sponsor’s status, rank and your enrollment type. Enrollment types include:

• Sponsor only

• Single enrollment (one family member, not sponsor)

• Family enrollment (more than one family member, not sponsor)

• Sponsor and family

Your cost-shares depend on your sponsor’s pay grade and where you live.

Coverage duration

Children can keep their TDP coverage until the end of the month they turn 23 if they:

• Are unmarried

• Attend an approved institution of higher education full-time

• Get at least half their financial support from their military sponsor

If your child stops meeting any of these conditions before turning 23, their coverage ends at the end of the month the change occurs. Additionally, if your child doesn’t meet these conditions at age 21, they’ll lose TRICARE coverage.

Services covered by TDP

The TDP covers a wide range of dental services for children, as described in the TRICARE Dental Program Handbook:

• Regular checkups and cleanings

• X-rays and evaluations

• Fluoride treatments

• Sealants for cavity prevention

• Fillings and restorations

• Orthodontics (braces) when medically necessary

• Emergency dental care

Most children can receive two routine teeth cleanings and two topical fluoride applications every 12 months. Your dentist can recommend the right schedule for your child’s needs.

Service frequency

The TDP provides coverage based on the following timeframes:

Every 12 months:

• Two oral checkups

• One set of bitewing X-rays

• Two routine cleanings

• Two fluoride applications

Every 36 months:

• One full mouth X-ray

• Sealants on permanent molars through age 18

Finding a dentist

To find a CONUS dentist, search the United Concordia network. If you’re overseas, use the OCONUS Find a Dentist tool.

Using military dental clinics

In the U.S., family members normally can’t get care at military dental clinics. But in certain situations, they may. These situations include:

Emergencies

Certain special dental cases in children

Dental work related to treatment received at a military hospital or clinic

Your family members may be able to use overseas military dental clinics if they have space available. Check with your local overseas military dental clinic to find out what services they offer.

The FDA granted the application priority review and expects to decide whether to approve the treatment by Nov. 9.
If approved, RGX-121 will be the first gene therapy for MPS II.
MPS II is caused by an I2S deficiency, which leads to the accumulation of glycosaminoglycans such as heparan sulfate (HS) in tissues and subsequent organ dysfunction.
Rockville, Maryland-based Regenxbio is seeking accelerated approval for RGX-121 based on positive biomarker data from the Phase I/II/III CAMPSIITE trial.","NEW YORK – The US Food and Drug Administration has accepted Regenxbio's biologics license application (BLA) seeking accelerated approval for its investigational gene therapy RGX-121 (clemidsogene lanparvovec) as a treatment for mucopolysaccharidosis II (MPS II), also known as Hunter syndrome, the biotech company said Tuesday.

The FDA granted the application priority review and expects to decide whether to approve the treatment by Nov. 9. If approved, RGX-121 will be the first gene therapy for MPS II.

""Acceptance of the RGX-121 BLA marks an exciting milestone on our path to bring the MPS II patient community a one-time treatment with the potential to address both the neurodevelopmental and systemic effects of Hunter syndrome,"" Regenxbio President and CEO Curran Simpson said in a statement.

RGX-121 is designed to deliver a functional copy of the IDS gene to the central nervous system, enabling production of functional iduronate-2-sulfatase (I2S) proteins. MPS II is caused by an I2S deficiency, which leads to the accumulation of glycosaminoglycans such as heparan sulfate (HS) in tissues and subsequent organ dysfunction.

Rockville, Maryland-based Regenxbio is seeking accelerated approval for RGX-121 based on positive biomarker data from the Phase I/II/III CAMPSIITE trial. In the study, levels of D2S6, a component of HS and a biomarker of I2S activity, dropped by a median of 86 percent in patients who received the gene therapy and were approaching normal levels after 16 weeks post-treatment.",https://crain-platform-precisiononcologynews-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/app-icons/favicon.ico,N,0.0,2025-05-13 19:56:37.927598

The instructions from the Defense Department barred any new hormone treatments as well as any surgical procedures for transgender troops, the memo said.
The Pentagon referred questions to the Defense Health Agency, which did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
There are 4,240 U.S. active-duty and National Guard transgender troops, officials have said.
Hegseth had made clear his opposition to gender-affirming care for transgender troops in a post on social media last month.","The Pentagon is halting gender-affirming health care for transgender troops as it moves to implement President Donald Trump's plan to kick them out of the U.S. military, according to a memo seen by Reuters on Monday.

The instructions from the Defense Department barred any new hormone treatments as well as any surgical procedures for transgender troops, the memo said.

“I am directing you to take the necessary steps to immediately implement this guidance,” Stephen Ferrara, the acting assistant secretary of defense for health affairs, said in the memo.

The Pentagon referred questions to the Defense Health Agency, which did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

Shannon Minter of the National Center for Lesbian Rights said that the abrupt termination of healthcare was “needlessly disrespectful and cruel.”

“It is shameful that our nation’s military would treat any service member this way,” Minter said.

One transgender service member, speaking on condition of anonymity out of fear of being targeted, called the decision “the latest slap in the face” to troops serving honorably.

“If there was any doubt left, there is not anymore: transgender service members are no longer entitled to the same standard of medical care as their peers,” the service member said.

The U.S. Supreme Court on May 6 permitted Trump’s administration to implement his ban on transgender people in the military, allowing the armed forces to discharge the thousands of current transgender troops and reject new recruits while legal challenges play out.

Reuters first reported last week a memo showing that U.S. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth issued instructions to start kicking out transgender troops who do not elect to leave on their own by June 6.

There are 4,240 U.S. active-duty and National Guard transgender troops, officials have said. Transgender rights advocates have given higher estimates.

Trump signed an executive order in January, after returning to the presidency, that reversed a policy implemented under his predecessor Joe Biden that had allowed transgender troops to serve openly.

A Gallup poll published in February found that 58% of Americans favored allowing openly transgender individuals to serve in the military, but the support had declined from 71% in 2019.

A former Fox News host, Hegseth has embraced conservative stances on culture war issues, including eliminating diversity initiatives at the Pentagon. Hegseth had made clear his opposition to gender-affirming care for transgender troops in a post on social media last month.

Re-posting an article that said the Pentagon would resume treatments for transgender troops, Hegseth said: “If this is true — we will find any way possible to stop it.”

“Taxpayers should NEVER pay for this lunacy,” Hegseth added.","https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_nbcnews-fp-1200-630,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2025-05/350513-us-soldier-silhouette-mn-1045-071967.jpg",N,0.0,2025-05-13 17:56:54.997532

To receive an emergency refill of prescription medications, TRICARE beneficiaries should take their prescription bottle to any TRICARE retail network pharmacy. If the bottle is unavailable or the label is damaged or missing, beneficiaries should contact Express Scripts, Inc., or their retail network pharmacy for assistance.

To find a network pharmacy, beneficiaries may call Express Scripts at 1-877-363-1303, or search the network pharmacy locator.

If possible, visit the pharmacy where the prescription was filled. Prescriptions filled by a retail chain may be filled at another store in that chain. If the clinician who prescribed the medication is available, beneficiaries can ask them to call in a new prescription to any network pharmacy.

As a reminder, TRICARE beneficiaries, other than active duty service members, may receive urgent care from any TRICARE-authorized urgent care center or provider and do not need a referral. This allows beneficiaries to seek nonemergency care for illnesses or injuries if their primary care provider is unavailable because of emergencies. Any TRICARE beneficiary who reasonably believes they have an emergency should always call 911 or, go to the nearest emergency room.

Beneficiaries are advised to visit Express Scripts’ Weather Notices page for updates.

Heroes show their true colors when devastation hits.

When Hurricane Helene swept through the southeastern United States in 2024, it was the deadliest hurricane to strike the U.S. mainland in almost 20 years.

Troy Akers, a physician and chief of emergency medicine at Dwight David Eisenhower Army Medical Center, Fort Eisenhower, Georgia, showed the world what real-world heroes look like in the storm’s aftermath.

Because of his heroism, Akers was named the 2025 Civilian Hero of Military Medicine in a ceremony on May 8, 2025.

The award recognizes Akers for his outstanding leadership, dedication to taking care of patients, and commitment to improving military medical practices.

""Dr. Troy Akers is a great example of the kind of dedicated person we are lucky to have in our unique health system,"" said Dr. David Smith, acting director of the Defense Health Agency.

Akers showed how he embodies selfless service during Hurricane Helene. Even though his own home was damaged, he focused on the needs of the community and the patients first.

""He grabbed a chainsaw and cut his way out of his home and local area so that he could reach the hospital. Which is where he stayed – around the clock – for the next eight days,"" Smith said. ""Dr. Akers stepped forward and made sure all patients were safely moved.""

The storm caused extensive damage, and the hospital lost power and water, forcing the evacuation of over 30 service members, family members, and civilians.

Akers coordinated the safe transfer of patients, including the critically ill, and worked with other hospitals to ensure everyone got the medical care they needed. He also led the effort to get the hospital back up and running after the storm.

Smith added, ""This is what leadership looks like during a crisis. These are the actions of someone who has the qualities we want: calmness, confidence, and caring for those he serves.""

Besides his leadership in emergencies, Akers is committed to teaching and training. He created a training program to improve skills for handling high-risk medical situations, benefiting over 250 health care workers.

Leaders at DDEAMC praised Akers for making the DDEAMC Emergency Room one of the best in the military health system. Akers focused on making things better, they said, which helped the department exceed national standards.

“With his leadership, DDEAMC was the first DHA medical center to create an emergency department team of DHA civilian interfacility transport paramedics,” said Col. (Dr.) Mark Craig, DDEAMC’s deputy commander for clinical services, when recommending Akers for the award.

“During times of chaos, such as Hurricane Helene, I witnessed his heroic efforts firsthand,” Craig added. “His commitment extends beyond daily responsibilities, showcasing remarkable resilience in catastrophic situations.”

A veteran of Operation Enduring Freedom, Akers previously served on active duty in the U.S. Army as an emergency medicine physician. During a deployment to Afghanistan as the flight surgeon for Task Force Viper, he took part in over 200 combat missions, often while under direct fire. He improved how patients were evacuated, saving lives, and for his actions, received the Bronze Star Medal. He was also named the 2011 Flight Surgeon of the Year by the Army Aviation Association of America.

""There are many ways to serve your country, and Troy Akers is a perfect example,” said Smith.

Akers clearly began serving his country when he first raised his right hand and swore to defend the nation, and he continues to live by that oath now.",https://d1ldvf68ux039x.cloudfront.net/thumbs/photos/2505/9032722/1000w_q95.jpg,N,1.0,2025-05-13 13:56:24.409755

I have 3 providers after me for a combined total of 30,000 in medical bills that should be Tricare's responsibility. Two of these are providers I have been seeing for years with no issues.

So I call Tricare. They are adamant that I am insured, evidenced by the claims that have been approved this year, some from the same providers on the same day as the one that are getting denied. They saiy it is an issue with how the providers are submitting the claim.

I can see the approved claims in my EOB, but the denied claims don't show up at all. I got claim numbers from the providers and asked Tricare about them and they said they had no record of them.

The providers are adamant that the claims are submitted correctly. One even offered to go on a 3 way call with me to try to get it straightened out. When I told the Tricare rep I wanted to do that she said that wasn't allowed and they could only talk to provider claims.

Now I feel backed into a corner with no idea what to do next and terrified these bills will fall on me. What can I do next at this point in the process?

I haven't been sent to collections yet but one of the providers is starting to get a little more aggressive.",,N,-1.0,2025-05-13 14:56:37.134743

Sgt. Loura Javier, surgical technician, 673rd Medical Group, Joint Base Elmendorf-Richardson, is leading a groundbreaking training partnership between JBER and Alaska Native Medical Center, a 182-bed, level 2 trauma hospital in Anchorage.

Javier designed and launched a rotational training program that places one Defense Health Agency surgical technologist at a time into ANMC’s 11-suite operating room department for a month-long immersive experience.

Under Javier's stewardship, the program aims to expose technicians to a high volume of complex and trauma surgical procedures, equipping them with the skills necessary to tackle their demanding roles and prepare them for potential future conflicts. “This program ensures our technicians are not only maintaining readiness but elevating it,” said Chief Master Sgt. Amy Miller, senior enlisted leader, 673 MDG. “Tech. Sgt. Javier has built a bridge between military and civilian care that directly enhances mission capability.”

Over the past six months, Javier has been embedded at ANMC, orchestrating the onboarding process, interfacing with human resources and employee health departments, and conducting orientations for the technologists who have completed rotations.

Senior Master Sgt. Michelle Mickens, operating room flight chief, 673 MDG, agrees. “Tech. Sgt. Javier’s unwavering dedication ensures each training plan is tailored to the technician’s strengths and growth areas, optimizing their learning and performance,” Mickens said.

This initiative is vital to the development of Mission Ready Airmen, capable of protecting our nation, projecting joint forces, and powering the Joint Base in the Great Power Competition.

Under her leadership, five technologists have already rotated through the program, collectively participating in 245 surgical procedures. Each technologist participating in the program surpassed their annual Comprehensive Medical Readiness training requirements, showcasing the effectiveness of the partnership and Javier's leadership.

Javier’s forward-thinking approach is setting a new standard for training innovation within military medicine. Her efforts are not only advancing individual proficiency but also ensuring that JBER’s surgical technologists are better prepared for any operational challenge.

“Her leadership has created a model for future partnerships,” said Col. Laura Baugh, commander 673 MDG. “Tech. Sgt.

“This expansion reflects our unwavering commitment to providing safe, effective, and therapeutic mental health care within our own system,” said Capt.

The expansion project, approved by the Defense Health Agency in November 2024, originated from planning efforts launched in November 2022. Through a coordinated vision shared among leadership, clinical departments, facilities staff, and safety experts, the project was brought to life with the goal of increasing access, improving therapeutic outcomes, and reinforcing the Navy’s commitment to warfighter readiness.

""When our service members are struggling, it affects not only their individual readiness but the collective strength of our force,"" said Rear Adm. Guido Valdes, Commander, Naval Medical Forces Pacific, and Director, Defense Health Network Pacific Rim. ""By delivering high-quality, evidence-based mental health services in a secure and supportive environment, this unit will ensure our warfighters receive the care they need to recover and return to duty—or transition with dignity to the next phase of their lives.""

The newly expanded 1 West ward moves NMCSD closer to its goal of increasing capacity from a historic 36-bed limit across the 1 North and 1 West units to a total of 48 beds by the end of the calendar year. The initiative is expected to eliminate active-duty disengagements to civilian care, improve engagement with veterans and beneficiaries, and generate an estimated $22.7 million in annual purchased care savings once all 24 new beds are staffed and in use.

“This expansion reflects our unwavering commitment to providing safe, effective, and therapeutic mental health care within our own system,” said Capt. Elizabeth Adriano, Director of NMCSD. “By retaining our service members in a military treatment facility, we preserve readiness, reduce costly external placements, and expand care access to those who have served and continue to serve.”

The original 1 West ward was last renovated in 2008, primarily to meet updated safety requirements. The current expansion project not only reinforces safety standards with structural upgrades—including ligature-resistant door hardware, lock replacements, and improved CCTV—but also places a strong emphasis on enhancing the therapeutic environment. Patients now benefit from access to a large outdoor courtyard, greater privacy, and improved treatment areas that support individualized care.

Additionally, the Program of Care has been refined to offer tailored therapeutic experiences, aligning treatment groups and clinical interventions with each patient’s specific diagnosis and symptom profile.

“This expansion not only allows us to recapture all active duty needing inpatient care—it establishes Naval Medical San Diego as the largest psychiatric inpatient facility within the Department of Defense,"" said. Cmdr. Nathan Hydes, NMCSD Director for Mental Health. ""In addition, the expansion allows us to accept and treat a more diverse group of patients, which directly serves our multiple training programs, including the Navy’s largest psychiatric residency.”

The project’s success was the result of a joint plan of action and milestones developed by the Directorate for Mental Health and the Directorate of Nursing Services, encompassing hiring initiatives, infrastructure improvements, space reorganization, and key procurement milestones.

The ribbon-cutting event highlighted the collective dedication and vision of the NMCSD team to deliver high-quality, mission-aligned behavioral health services that preserve the force, support families, and promote holistic well-being.

To address this, the Department of Defense offers behavioral health care—such as treatment for depression or substance use—through its TRICARE health program.

Participants can seek this care from private providers, who then must submit claims to be paid for it. Our work included looking at how quickly DOD contractors processed claims from behavioral health providers for care delivered from 2018 through 2023.

These claims were generally processed as quickly as other types of claims, with almost 90% processed within 30 days.

What GAO Found

The Department of Defense's (DOD) two managed care support contractors generally processed TRICARE claims for care provided between 2018 and 2023 within required timeliness standards. The claims process involves determining payment amounts to civilian health care providers, including behavioral health providers. DOD's timeliness standards require contractors to process 98 percent of TRICARE claims within 30 days, and 100 percent of claims within 90 days.

Although DOD does not apply these standards to specific provider types, GAO separately analyzed the nearly 28 million claims from behavioral health providers over the 6-year period. GAO found that almost 90 percent were processed in 30 days. In addition, the percentage of claims processed within 30 and 90 days generally increased each year (see figure for the 3 most recent years).

Time to Process TRICARE Claims Submitted by Behavioral Health Providers for Care Provided in Calendar Years 2021-2023, by Managed Care Support Contractor

To oversee TRICARE payment accuracy, DOD monitored internal and external audit reports of randomly sampled claims from all types of providers, including behavioral health providers. DOD assessed contractor performance on all audited claims against the payment accuracy standards—which require payment error rates to not exceed between 2 and 1.75 percent, depending on the year of the contract—and took action when necessary. Across the audit reports from 2018 through 2023, claims from behavioral health providers made up between 1 and 8 percent of audited claims.

DOD's oversight actions were consistent with its oversight goal for early identification and resolution of performance issues, and with a recommended practice from the Office of Management and Budget and prior GAO work that federal agencies use multiple sources of evidence to support decision-making.

Why GAO Did This Study

To support military deployments and provide health care, including behavioral health care, DOD operates a health system known as TRICARE. This system offers behavioral health and other services to over nine million eligible beneficiaries in military hospitals and clinics, or through authorized civilian providers in the private sector.

The Conference Report 118-301 accompanying the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2024 includes a provision for GAO to report on TRICARE's payments to civilian network behavioral health providers. This report examines (1) the timeliness of TRICARE claims processing and (2) DOD's oversight of payment accuracy to all civilian providers, including behavioral health providers.

GAO reviewed relevant documents, such as DOD and contractor reports for timeliness and accuracy, and DOD's oversight plans for the TRICARE contracts. GAO also analyzed time frames for processing claims from behavioral health providers from 2018 through 2023 and audit findings on payment accuracy. Finally, GAO interviewed DOD officials with oversight responsibilities of TRICARE's contractors, contractor staff, and four selected behavioral health provider groups who participate in TRICARE. GAO compared DOD's oversight activities to a DOD goal and a recommended practice.

Meet Adrian De-Heer

Adrian, 69 years-young, lives with his wife Ingrid at TriCare Compton Gardens Retirement Community and they love it!

“TriCare Compton Gardens in Aspley, Brisbane is like a Dutch village from my childhood—compact (but adequate) homes, close to everywhere and everything, convenient, near the bus-stop, with no-one ever complaining,” Adrian said.

“Indeed, the people are very friendly!”

“We always said we would never live in one of those villages where the homes are too big for our life stage—we want to travel overseas and visit our children and grandchildren, not worry about our house needing more work.”

Adrian left the Netherlands aged 26 with his wife, chasing their desire for warmth and the palm trees of the South Pacific.

“We left our Dutch village and emigrated without any real knowledge of what to expect.

We were running from the Cold War, the freezing weather, and economic downturn,” he said.

Adrian’s search first led to New Zealand—a country with temperate weather rather than heat, and far fewer tropical palm trees than he was expecting!

“We emigrated to New Zealand and found ourselves bunking in with another Dutch couple in a caravan in April at Hawke’s Bay and freezing every night,” Adrian said.

“We eventually found what we wanted in Brisbane, Queensland, Australia instead of New Zealand! But back then, there was no internet to search things up.”

Home At Last

Adrian and Ingrid finally settled in sunny, warm and tropical Brisbane and raised three children while owning and running a printing business which was sold 15 years ago.

“We had to be handy as well as resourceful in our printing business,” Adrian said.

“Running a business requires you have to get very good at finding fixes. Machines break down, parts break, and you have to find a way to fix them within your means.”

“I would say it kept me sharp and resourceful after all these years!”

Cyclone Alfred Blows In

As Cyclone Alfred approached the south-east Queensland coast the TriCare Compton Gardens Retirement Village in Aspley Brisbane experienced some strong wind gusts.

When a particularly strong gust blew his neighbour, Michael’s fixed skylight right off, Adrian was able to come to the rescue!

“With a big hole in his roof, Michael was worried about internal water damage,” Adrian said.

He’d called the SES (State Emergency Service) but many people were needing SES assistance at that time.

With the cyclone looming closer the rain increased and Michael’s buckets and towels could not capture the water pouring inside.

Michael gave me a call to see if I could help and I thought, I have just the thing!”

Adrian then armed himself with a good ole’ Bunnings umbrella, braved the crazy winds and rain to reach Michael’s home and climbed a ladder to inspect the damage.

“Sure enough, the umbrella fit perfectly between the broken part of the skylight and was successful in keeping the rain out of Michael’s home,” Adrian said.

A Humble Hero

Adrian certainly didn’t expect to become a TriCare hero but he is chuffed that his quick thinking was able to save Michael’s cherished home in the retirement village from flooding!

He admitted at the time he didn’t think much of the heroic act.

“I was a little overwhelmed by the reaction—I know anyone else in our Village would have done the same to help out,” he said.

“I’m just glad that the Bunnings umbrella did its job until the SES team arrived to fix the roof.”

The Power of Community at Compton Gardens Retirement Living Village

A sense of community and helping others are important values for Adrian. It was a key factor in why he and Ingrid chose to move to the TriCare’s Retirement Living Community at Aspley village 18 months ago.

“Living at TriCare Compton Gardens Retirement Community has been one of the best decisions we’ve made. From the moment we moved in, we felt embraced by the warm and welcoming community that truly feels like home, the fellowship is wonderful,” said Adrian.

“There are so many positives to retirement living—being part of a greater community and living with like-minded people is such a benefit.”

One of the standout features at Compton Gardens Retirement Living Community is the bustling social calendar and neighbourhood.

“There’s always something happening—from happy hours and games evenings to movie nights and monthly concerts featuring jazz bands and local school choirs.

“These events provide wonderful opportunities to connect with fellow residents and build lasting friendships. We’re certainly having a great time here,” said Adrian.

“From aqua aerobics classes to tai chi sessions, it’s great to have such a wide range of activities to help us maintain our health and independence… and keep us busy!”

However, one of Adrian’s favourite things to do these days is monitoring the weather and keeping an umbrella handy in case of an emergency!",https://www.tricare.com.au/app/uploads/2025/05/1000002809-e1747110992909.jpg,N,0.0,2025-05-13 04:56:20.423712

""If this is true - we will find any way possible to stop it,"" Hegseth responded to reports on the resumption of such treatments.","Per Reuters, the Pentagon has referred all questions about this change in policy to the Defense Health Agency, which has so far not responded to requests for clarification.

This comes after a recent decision by the US Supreme Court that allowed Trump's administration to enforce a ban on transgender people in the military.

The ruling allows armed forces to discharge existing transgender personnel and reject new recruits while legal disputes continue.

Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth has commanded the removal of transgender troops who don't voluntarily leave by June 6.

The order was disclosed in a memo accessed by Reuters last week.

Officials said there are currently 4,240 active-duty and National Guard transgender personnel in the US military.

However, transgender rights advocates believe the number is much higher than what official estimates claim.

In January, Trump signed an executive order reversing a policy of his predecessor, Joe Biden.

The earlier policy had ensured transgender troops could serve openly in the military.

A Gallup poll in February had found 58% of Americans in favor of open service by transgender people in the military. However, it was a drop from 71% in 2019.

“Certified Professional Midwives and Certified Midwives at freestanding birth centers stand ready to serve military families, but Tricare doesn’t currently reimburse for their care.","Submitted by Office of Rep. Marilyn Strickland.

Last week, on International Day of the Midwife, Congresswoman Marilyn Strickland (WA-10), reintroduced the Maternal and Infant Delivery: Wellness, and Integration with Vital Expertise Support (MIDWIVES) for Servicemembers Act.

U.S. Representatives Emily Randall (WA-06), Juan Ciscomani (AZ-06), and Jen Kiggans (VA-02) co-led the bipartisan midwifery legislation.

The bill would increase access to maternity care for servicemembers and their families by extending midwifery care to those enrolled in TRICARE through a 5-year pilot program. This legislation expands access to midwifery care and gives the Department of Defense the option to permanently expand coverage if the pilot program is successful.

“It is our job to support our servicemembers, and this includes providing help before, during and after childbirth,” said Strickland. “This bill expands midwifery care options, giving servicemembers and their families the care that they deserve.”

“As our troops and their families serve our nation, they deserve access to the very best care, especially if they are looking to start or expand their family,” said Ciscomani. “As a dad of six I can tell you, planning to welcome a child to your family is an exciting time. However, serving in the military or having a spouse in uniform can pose additional difficulties for mothers-to-be. This is why I once again joined Rep. Strickland in a bipartisan effort to expand access to midwifery care for military spouses and women in uniform who are enrolled in TRICARE to ensure they can receive the care they need.”

“Sexual and reproductive health care is essential, and we have a responsibility to ensure that service members and their families can access the care they deserve,” said Randall. “Expanding midwifery services through TRICARE is a critical step toward closing the dangerous gaps in maternal health care that too many people — especially those who serve our nation— are forced to navigate.”

“As a Navy veteran and former nurse practitioner, I know firsthand the importance of high-quality, accessible maternal care for our military families,” said Kiggans. “The MIDWIVES for Service Members Act is a commonsense, data-driven solution that expands care options under TRICARE, improves outcomes for mothers and babies, and helps reduce strain on military healthcare systems. I’m proud to help lead this bipartisan effort to better support those who serve by delivering the care they and their families deserve.”

The MIDWIVES for Servicemembers Act is endorsed by: American Association of Birth Centers (AABC), American College of Nurse-Midwives (ACNM), National Association of Certified Professional Midwives (NACPM), Birth Center Equity (BCE), Policy Institute for Community Birth and Midwifery (PICBM), True North Birth Center, and the National Partnership on Women and Families.

“As a retired military spouse, a mother who relied on TRICARE during my own pregnancies, and a midwife who has supported countless families, I know firsthand the unique challenges military families face. Being restationed—sometimes well into pregnancy—often means starting over and scrambling to find a new provider in areas already facing serious shortages. For the past year and a half, I’ve been advocating for a solution which has become The MIDWIVES for Service Members Act. Midwives provide safe, evidence-based, and compassionate care that meets families where they are. This bill will not only improve continuity of care for military families—it will expand access to high-quality maternity care nationwide. I’m deeply grateful to Representatives Strickland, Ciscomani, Randall, and all the supporters of this bill for recognizing the urgent need to better serve our nation’s heroes and their loved ones—no matter where duty takes them,” said Ashley Jones, Licensed Midwife and Executive Director of True North Birth Center please.

“The MIDWIVES for Servicemembers Act directly addresses a critical gap in maternity care for military families by expanding TRICARE to include all credentialed midwives. By recognizing Certified Professional Midwives and Certified Midwives as authorized providers, this bill not only increases access to care, especially in underserved areas, but also affirms the right of military families to choose safe community-based care. With over half of U.S. birth centers staffed by CPMs, this legislation will dramatically expand access to midwifery-led birth center services. NACPM strongly supports this bill as a meaningful, evidence-based solution that honors the dignity, autonomy, and well-being of our nation’s servicemembers and their families,” said Cassaundra Jah, Executive Director of the National Association of Certified Professional Midwives.

“The National Partnership for Women & Families applauds the reintroduction of the MIDWIVES for Servicemembers Act, which would provide more care options for servicemembers, especially ones that reside in rural or maternity care shortage areas,” said Amani Echols, Senior Manager for Maternal & Infant Health at the National Partnership for Women & Families. “Research shows that midwifery care provides equal or better care and outcomes compared to physician care on many fronts. For example, midwifery care results in higher rates of spontaneous vaginal birth, higher rates of breastfeeding, higher satisfaction with care, and lower overall costs. Passage of the MIDWIVES for Servicemembers Act is an integral step towards improving maternal and infant health.”

“Expanding midwifery coverage for service members is a lasting investment in families,” says Leseliey Welch, Co-Founder and CEO of Birth Center Equity. “Evidence shows that the midwifery model of care leads to excellent outcomes including lower rates of interventions like cesarean sections and episiotomies, and increased patient satisfaction. Midwifery care also emphasizes a personalized, relationship-centered approach, fostering trust and empowerment for the birthing person.” With this bill, says Welch, “we hope that more and more service members will gain access to birth centers, the only health care facilities based in the midwifery model of care.”

“The American Association of Birth Centers is proud to support the Midwives for Servicemembers Act. Expanding coverage to include certified professional midwives and certified midwives will significantly improve access to midwifery-led birth center care. We commend Rep. Marilyn Strickland, Rep. Emily Randall, Rep. Juan Ciscomani, and Rep. Jen Kiggans for their leadership in advancing high-quality maternity care for our service members and their families,” said Trinisha Williams, President of AABC.

“Certified Professional Midwives and Certified Midwives at freestanding birth centers stand ready to serve military families, but Tricare doesn’t currently reimburse for their care. The Policy Institute for Community Birth and Midwifery is deeply grateful to Congresswoman Strickland for introducing the Midwives for Service Members Act, which would ensure these nationally certified providers are reimbursed. As military hospitals close maternity units and care deserts grow, midwives and birth centers are vital to filling the gap and ensuring military families aren’t left without options, said Mary Lawlor, CPM, Executive Director, Policy Institute for Community Birth and Midwifery.”

“The American College of Nurse-Midwives urges policymakers to support the Midwives for Service Members Act to ensure that military families have access to the full range of high-quality maternity care options, including midwifery services. Expanding access to certified midwives and certified professional midwives within the Military Health System is a cost-effective, evidence-based strategy to improve maternal health outcomes, enhance patient satisfaction, and address longstanding disparities in access to care for those who serve our country,” said Michelle Munroe, retired Army Colonel, and CEO of the American College of Nurse-Midwives",https://thesubtimes.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2021/07/TST-Featured-Image.png,N,0.0,2025-05-12 22:56:19.242465

Last week, Reuters reported on a memo showing that U.S. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth issued instructions that transgender troops were to either voluntarily leave or be removed from their posts starting on June 6.

This new memo appears to be a follow-up on Hegseth’s instructions.

As reported by HealthExec, in March the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) announced it would stop providing gender-affirming care to former military personnel, ending coverage for hormone therapy. The agency said it never covered surgical interventions, thus no new ban was imposed.

However, when issuing its guidance, the VA said the change would only impact new enrollees. Those already receiving care would continue to have it covered. It’s unclear if these new directives at the DOD will impact that policy.

(NASDAQ: ZYXI) is facing a double whammy linked to its dealings with TriCare, the healthcare program for the U.S. military community. The company's first-quarter 2025 results revealed a sharp downturn, largely attributed to a temporary payment suspension by one of its major payers, TriCare.

Adding to the company’s troubles, this very TriCare payment issue has now become central to a recently announced class action lawsuit filed on behalf of Zynex investors. The lawsuit, Tuncel v. Zynex, Inc., No. 25-cv-00913 (D. Colo.), alleges that Zynex and certain top executives violated federal securities laws between March 13, 2023, and March 11, 2025.

Disappointing Q1 2025 Results Due to TriCare Suspension

On April 29, 2025, Zynex reported that its net revenue for the first quarter of 2025 plummeted to $26.6 million, a significant drop from the $46.5 million reported in the same period of 2024. The company also experienced a contraction in gross profit margin, falling to 69% in Q1 2025, compared to 80% in the prior year. The bottom line reflected these challenges, with an adjusted EBITDA loss of $11.8 million, a stark contrast to the $1.7 million in adjusted EBITDA recorded in the first quarter of 2024.

On the earnings call, Zynex CEO Thomas Sandgaard directly cited the TriCare payment suspension as a primary driver of the disappointing first-quarter results. He stated that the disruption significantly impacted revenue calculations and prompted the company to initiate a restructuring to prepare for a scenario where TriCare payments remain halted.

Looking ahead, Zynex has offered a muted revenue guidance of $27 million for the second quarter of 2025, with an anticipated EPS loss of $0.20. The company has withheld full-year guidance pending clarity on the TriCare situation, a decision that reflects the significant uncertainty surrounding this key payer relationship.

Analysts on the earnings call voiced concerns that the TriCare situation could create a domino effect, prompting other insurers to re-evaluate their reimbursement policies for Zynex's device.

Zynex Securities Class Action Alleges ""Oversupplying"" Scheme

The payment woes with Tricare appear to be intertwined with more serious allegations leveled against Zynex in a newly filed securities class action.

The core of the lawsuit’s allegations mirrors the explanation provided by Zynex for its poor financial performance. Investors claim that the company misled them by failing to disclose practices that ultimately led to the TriCare payment suspension. Specifically, the lawsuit contends that Zynex shipped excessive amounts of products, including electrodes, inflating revenue and drawing scrutiny from insurers like TriCare. The plaintiffs argue that the company should have warned investors about the likely adverse consequences of these practices, including the potential for payment suspensions and removal from insurer networks.

The complaint highlights a more than 5% drop in Zynex's share price following a June 4, 2024 report by STAT detailing an alleged ""oversupplying scheme."" This report, according to the lawsuit, raised concerns about the company's billing practices and likely contributed to the increased scrutiny from payers like TriCare.

The lawsuit further points to a dramatic over 51% plunge in Zynex's share price on March 11, 2025, the day the company reported its disappointing fourth-quarter 2024 results and disclosed the significant TriCare payment suspension.

Hagens Berman’s Investigation

Shareholder rights firm Hagens Berman is investigating the alleged claims. “The significant revenue decline and the revised guidance following the TriCare payment suspension raise serious questions about the accuracy and timeliness of Zynex's prior statements to investors. We are investigating whether the company adequately disclosed the risks associated with its billing practices and its reliance on TriCare revenues,” said Reed Kathrein, the Hagens Berman Partner leading the firm’s probe.

Breen,,,,,https://natlawreview.com/article/eleventh-circuit-addresses-rule-9b-heightened-pleading-standard-false-claims-act,"The Eleventh Circuit reversed in part, holding that certain allegations of upcoding were adequately pleaded under Rule 9(b) to survive a motion to dismiss.
Reliability and Falsity The Eleventh Circuit concluded that the relators successfully pleaded specific allegations relating to the CPAP accessory scheme.
With this decision, the Eleventh Circuit has made clear that merely alleging fraudulent schemes or practices is not enough to survive a Rule 9(b) challenge.
Relators must allege concrete details connecting alleged schemes to actual false claims submitted to the government.
As demonstrated in Vargas, the Eleventh Circuit’s strict application of the standard underscores the high bar that relators must clear to avoid dismissal at the pleading stage.","The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit has concluded that a successful False Claims Act (FCA) claim should “allege not just a scheme, but a scheme that actually led to false claims being submitted to the government”—and must do so with particularity.

This heightened pleading standard cost the qui tam relators in United States ex rel. Vargas v. Lincare, Inc. et al., 24-11080, 2025 WL 1122196 (11th Cir. Apr. 16, 2025), three out of the four claims in their fourth amended complaint. The U.S. District Court for the Middle District of Florida had dismissed the entire complaint for failing to plead sufficient facts under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 9(b) (“Rule 9(b)”).

The Eleventh Circuit reversed in part, holding that certain allegations of upcoding were adequately pleaded under Rule 9(b) to survive a motion to dismiss. The complaint alleged that the defendants, a medical supplier and its subsidiary, improperly coded the accessories (i.e., batteries, chargers, and cables) of continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) machines as ventilator accessories. Ventilator accessories are covered by TRICARE, a health insurance program for military personnel and their families; CPAP accessories are not.

The Eleventh Circuit affirmed the dismissal of claims alleging: (1) the routine waiver of patient copays in violation of TRICARE conditions of participation; (2) automatic shipments of CPAP supplies, such as masks (TRICARE covers these supplies only upon a request); and (3) illegal kickbacks to employees of labs or medical offices who could choose which supplier was used.

“The most direct way to satisfy [Rule 9(b)] is by identifying specific claims submitted to the government: invoices, billing records, reimbursement forms,” wrote Senior U.S. Circuit Judge Gerald Bard Tjoflat. Alternative means (other than documentary proof) may satisfy Rule 9(b), the court noted, as long as the claim has “sufficient indicia of reliability”—a case-by-case determination.

Reliability and Falsity

The Eleventh Circuit concluded that the relators successfully pleaded specific allegations relating to the CPAP accessory scheme. The court rejected the defendants’ arguments that: (1) there were insufficient indicia of reliability to show that an actual claim was submitted, and (2) even if claims were submitted, they were not false. On these points, the court determined the following:

Reliability: The relators adequately alleged hands-on access to private records, including patient files, billing correspondence, and authorizations for payment—“the type of inside information that [is] sufficient at the pleading stage.” The relators identified specific claims (i.e., specific instances of upcoding), with dates, amounts, and billing codes.

Falsity: The relators adequately alleged that the coding practices were improper and the resulting claims were false. Though the defendants claimed that TRICARE allowed the substitute ventilator codes, this was a factual dispute and not grounds for dismissal, per the court.

Meanwhile, the relators identified no specific false claims submitted to TRICARE in connection with: (1) any co-pay waiver, (2) the auto-ship scheme involving CPAP replacement supplies, or (3) the alleged kickbacks.

No Shotgun Pleadings

In a separate concurrence, Judge Tjoflat called attention to a “foundational pleading defect that the District Court did not reach.” The relators’ fourth amended complaint, he noted, packed all four of the fraud claims described above into a single count—burdening the courts, defendants, and the appellate process.

“That is not how litigation works,” he wrote. “The fourth amended complaint is a shotgun pleading—something we have condemned time and time again. It…forces courts to play detective rather than umpire.”

Shotgun pleadings, the judge stated, run counter to Rule 8 (requiring statements in a claim to be “short and plain,” with allegations that are “simple, concise, and direct”) and Rule 10 (requiring each claim founding on a separate transaction or occurrence to be stated in a separate count, “if doing so would promote clarity”). When confronted with a shotgun complaint, he said, a defendant should move for a more definite statement under Rule 12(e). And a district court should sua sponte strike it—“early and firmly.”

Takeaways

The Vargas decision offers clarity in the Eleventh Circuit on the rigorous application of the Rule 9(b) “reliable indicia” standard in the FCA context. With this decision, the Eleventh Circuit has made clear that merely alleging fraudulent schemes or practices is not enough to survive a Rule 9(b) challenge. Relators must allege concrete details connecting alleged schemes to actual false claims submitted to the government. Failure to do so is likely to result in dismissal. As demonstrated in Vargas, the Eleventh Circuit’s strict application of the standard underscores the high bar that relators must clear to avoid dismissal at the pleading stage.

Why This Matters for Military Members

Let’s be honest—military life is demanding. The stress, the deployments, the constant readiness… it’s a lot. And for many service members, alcohol becomes a coping mechanism. According to the National Institute on Drug Abuse, about 1 in 3 active-duty personnel engages in binge drinking, and heavy alcohol use is even more common in the military than in the general population. It’s a serious issue that can lead to physical health problems, strained relationships, and even career setbacks.

What You Can Expect at Ona Treatment Center

Outpatient programs if you want to stay at home while getting treatment

Medication-assisted treatment (MAT) with options like naltrexone to reduce cravings

Cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) and counseling to help change the way you think about drinking

Family therapy and support programs to bring your loved ones into your recovery process

Dual diagnosis treatment if you’re also dealing with mental health challenges like PTSD or anxiety

The team at Ona knows this isn’t just about stopping drinking—it’s about getting your life back, rebuilding your confidence, and learning how to thrive without alcohol. And they’re here to walk with you through it.

Getting Started Is Easier Than You Think

That’s a huge relief, especially when finances are tight or you’re trying to support a family.

System-Wide Assessment and Future Directions

High-level discussions grappled with the overarching MHS structure, the effectiveness of current training paradigms, and the evolving needs of the future military medical workforce. A key presentation detailed the Section 724 study, a comprehensive USU-led assessment evaluating MHS education and training programs specifically through the lens of operational readiness. Presenters included Dr. Glendon Diehl, USU's vice president for External Affairs, and Mr. Allen Middleton, senior advisor to the USU President. Mandated by Congress, this study aims to create a dynamic digital dashboard enabling data-driven insights and fostering collaborative improvement across the MHS. ""If you don’t train the force the right way, you won’t be able to execute the mission,” Middleton stated pointedly. Diehl elaborated, ""If you're not filling to the requirement, then you should understand what your risk and your gap is.""

USU President Dr. Jonathan Woodson emphasized the necessity of adapting the MHS workforce to a landscape constantly being reshaped by demographic shifts, rapid technological advancements, and emerging models of care, stressing the unique readiness requirements inherent to the military context. Dr. Jeffrey Freeman, director of USU's National Center for Disaster Medicine and Public Health (NCDMPH), guided a discussion on Medical Operations Coordination Centers (MOCCs), exploring ways to enhance national preparedness for health crises.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The Pentagon is halting gender-affirming healthcare for transgender troops as it moves to kick them out of the U.S. military, according to a memo seen by Reuters on Monday.

There are 4,240 U.S. active-duty and National Guard transgender troops, officials have said. Transgender rights advocates have given higher estimates.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) -The Pentagon is halting gender-affirming healthcare for transgender troops as it moves to implement President Donald Trump's plan to kick them out of the U.S. military, according to a memo seen by Reuters on Monday.

The instructions from the Defense Department barred any new hormone treatments as well as any surgical procedures for transgender troops, the memo said.

""I am directing you to take the necessary steps to immediately implement this guidance,"" Stephen Ferrara, the acting assistant secretary of defense for health affairs, said in the memo.

The Pentagon referred questions to the Defense Health Agency, which did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

Shannon Minter of the National Center for Lesbian Rights said that the abrupt termination of healthcare was ""needlessly disrespectful and cruel.""

""It is shameful that our nation's military would treat any service member this way,"" Minter said.

One transgender service member, speaking on condition of anonymity out of fear of being targeted, called the decision ""the latest slap in the face"" to troops serving honorably.

""If there was any doubt left, there is not anymore: transgender service members are no longer entitled to the same standard of medical care as their peers,"" the service member said.

The U.S. Supreme Court on May 6 permitted Trump's administration to implement his ban on transgender people in the military, allowing the armed forces to discharge the thousands of current transgender troops and reject new recruits while legal challenges play out.

Reuters first reported last week a memo showing that U.S. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth issued instructions to start kicking out transgender troops who do not elect to leave on their own by June 6.

Trump signed an executive order in January, after returning to the presidency, that reversed a policy implemented under his predecessor Joe Biden that had allowed transgender troops to serve openly.

A Gallup poll published in February found that 58% of Americans favored allowing openly transgender individuals to serve in the military, but the support had declined from 71% in 2019.

A former Fox News host, Hegseth has embraced conservative stances on culture war issues, including eliminating diversity initiatives at the Pentagon. Hegseth had made clear his opposition to gender-affirming care for transgender troops in a post on social media last month.

The ceremony, led by Lieutenant (junior grade) Beth Hillman, highlighted a culture of excellence that defines the Military Health System and celebrated the vital contributions of its nurses and corpsmen.

The DAISY Award—an acronym for Diseases Attacking the Immune System—was created by the family of Patrick Barnes, who passed away in 1999 from complications of Immune Thrombocytopenic Purpura (ITP), an autoimmune disease. What began as a heartfelt “thank you” to nurses who brought compassion and comfort during a time of grief has grown into a global movement that honors extraordinary clinical skill and empathetic care.

“We are honored to be here to recognize the invaluable contribution of our nurses and corpsmen to our Military Health System,” said Lt. j.g. Hillman during the ceremony. “Their compassion and excellence elevate the standard of care and embody the mission of the DAISY Foundation.”

As part of this year’s ceremony, USNH Sigonella proudly announced the nominees and honorees for the 2025 DAISY Awards. These individuals exemplify the hospital’s commitment to high-quality, safe, and patient-centered care:

Lieutenant (junior grade) Emma Bartlett

These professionals are more than just caregivers—they are leaders, mentors, and symbols of the enduring values that uphold military medicine. Their recognition reinforces USNH Sigonella’s commitment to fostering a culture of excellence, where every act of care contributes to force readiness and global mission success.

As one of the Defense Health Agency’s Overseas Military Treatment Facilities, USNH Sigonella supports U.S. Fifth and Sixth Fleet operations, ensuring that both active duty service members and their families receive exceptional care. The ceremony underscored that in every patient interaction, these medical professionals embody the best of Navy Medicine.

Sgt. Loura Javier, surgical technician, 673rd Medical Group, Joint Base Elmendorf-Richardson, Anchorage, Alaska, is leading a groundbreaking training partnership between JBER and Alaska Native Medical Center, a 182-bed, level 2 trauma hospital in Anchorage, Alaska.

Javier designed and launched a rotational training program that places one Defense Health Agency surgical technologist at a time into ANMC’s 11-suite operating room department for a month-long immersive experience.

Under Javier's stewardship, the program aims to expose technicians to a high volume of complex and trauma surgical procedures, equipping them with the skills necessary to tackle their demanding roles and prepare them for potential future conflicts.

“This program ensures our technicians are not only maintaining readiness but elevating it,” said Chief Master Sgt. Amy Miller, senior enlisted leader, 673 MDG. “Tech. Sgt. Javier has built a bridge between military and civilian care that directly enhances mission capability.”

Over the past six months, Javier has been embedded at ANMC, orchestrating the onboarding process, interfacing with human resources and employee health departments, and conducting orientations for the technologists who have completed rotations.

Senior Master Sgt. Michelle Mickens, operating room flight chief, 673 MDG, agrees.

“Tech. Sgt. Javier’s unwavering dedication ensures each training plan is tailored to the technician’s strengths and growth areas, optimizing their learning and performance,” Mickens said.

This initiative is vital to the development of Mission Ready Airmen, capable of protecting our nation, projecting joint forces, and powering the Joint Base in the Great Power Competition.

Under her leadership, five technologists have already rotated through the program, collectively participating in 245 surgical procedures. Each technologist participating in the program surpassed their annual Comprehensive Medical Readiness training requirements, showcasing the effectiveness of the partnership and Javier's leadership.

Javier’s forward-thinking approach is setting a new standard for training innovation within military medicine. Her efforts are not only advancing individual proficiency but also ensuring that JBER’s surgical technologists are better prepared for any operational challenge.

“Her leadership has created a model for future partnerships,” said Col. Laura Baugh, commander 673 MDG. “Tech. Sgt. Javier embodies the spirit of excellence, and her work will have a lasting impact on the future of military medical training.”",https://d1ldvf68ux039x.cloudfront.net/thumbs/photos/2505/9030512/1000w_q95.jpg,N,0.0,2025-05-12 15:56:50.623481
