A combination of a key executive departure, a sustained share price decline, and the looming release of quarterly results has placed the company under intense scrutiny.
The company's previous earnings report, released on July 31st, severely missed market expectations, revealing a quarterly revenue of $22.29 million and a loss per share of $0.66.

A combination of a key executive departure, a sustained share price decline, and the looming release of quarterly results has placed the company under intense scrutiny. The critical question for investors is whether Zynex can navigate a path to recovery.

All eyes are on the upcoming quarterly figures scheduled for November 7th. The company's previous earnings report, released on July 31st, severely missed market expectations, revealing a quarterly revenue of $22.29 million and a loss per share of $0.66. This disappointing performance triggered an immediate sell-off, sending the share price down by 11.66 percent.

A central issue plaguing the company's finances is the ongoing payment suspension from its largest insurance client, Tricare. Despite Zynex filing an appeal and submitting data in April 2025, Tricare has maintained its temporary halt on payments. This blockage continues to place massive pressure on the company's revenue stream, and the market is keen to see if the Q3 report will indicate a resolution to this critical dispute.

Leadership Shake-Up Raises Strategic Questions

Adding to the company's instability, a significant change occurred in its executive team on October 10, 2025, when Anna Lucsok resigned from her position as Chief Commercial Officer. The company's Compensation Committee expedited the release of 60,746 stock options for the departing executive. The exit of a key leader from the sales division has prompted concerns about the future direction and execution of Zynex's sales strategy for its pain management and rehabilitation products.

Should investors sell immediately? Or is it worth buying Zynex?

Bearish Sentiment Dominates Trading

The stock's performance paints a clear picture of investor pessimism. On October 30, the equity experienced a sharp decline, falling 5.30 percent to close at $1.25. Over the preceding seven-day period, the stock accumulated a loss of 15.07 percent. Trading activity has been predominantly negative, with the stock closing higher on only 12 out of the last 30 trading days, while exhibiting a volatility reading of 5.04 percent.

Key price points include:

* October 30, 2025: Price fell to $1.25, a 5.30% drop.

* Previous 7 Days: A cumulative decline of 15.07%.

* 52-Week Low: $1.21

* 52-Week High: $9.33

This downward trajectory has drastically reduced the firm's market capitalization, which now stands at a mere $37.87 million, confirming the dominant bearish trend.",https://mdb.ad-hoc-news.de/bilder/bild-2373364_600_800.jpg,N,0.0,2025-11-02 15:59:38.758407

I just retired and kept mine. VA primary care doc just asked for model and serial number at my initial appointment. After a month or so, they sent me the supplies in the mail. Pretty seamless.

I had to contact the va sleep clinic. It was a pain in the ass. Eventually I just got someone..a technician? who called, walked me through pulling the settings off the machine, and she shipped me one from the va. That populated the ability to order supplies through va.gov.

When it showed it up was already preprogrammed with the settings I already had. I have no idea if someone is “monitoring” it. Nor do I really give a shit cause I can’t do without it for a good single night anymore so I have no worries about the non use part.

Following this thread. I'm still waiting on my BDD claim, but I have my Cpap since 2023. I know the fact that mine is a rental from a medical company (TYCOM). I've kinda thinking about it too, so I'm gonna call tricare and the hospital sleep clinic on how should I proceed after I retire.

If you have Tricare cover it (the cpap) you should be good, you will probably have a co-pay tho. I use the VA so yes, I had to swap, but no co-pay. I retired in 2022 and have a sleep apnea rating.",,N,0.0,2025-11-01 23:00:09.391602

The fraudulent postcard claims to be part of a “2025 Veteran Giveback Program” or “Veteran Savings Program,” falsely suggesting that veterans and their spouses may be eligible for up to an extra $110 added to their monthly Social Security checks. It also promises free dental coverage and instructs recipients to call a phone number within five days to “help manage call volume.”

Officials emphasize that this message is not legitimate. There is no such program offering these benefits. The postcard is designed to deceive recipients into calling a fraudulent phone number where scammers attempt to collect personal or financial information.

According to the Federal Communications Commission (FCC), these types of scams often target veterans by using patriotic language, references to real programs such as CHAMPVA and TRICARE For Life, and official-sounding language to appear credible. Once victims call the number, scammers may request sensitive details such as Social Security numbers, VA claim numbers or bank account information.

The Dare County Veterans Advisory Council reminds residents to never share personal or financial information with anyone who contacts them unexpectedly—whether it’s by phone, email, text or mail. Remember: Government agencies and legitimate veterans’ organizations will never ask for these types of details in unsolicited communications.

DOW JONES NEWSWIRES

Aetna Inc. (AET) has been disqualified from further consideration for a contract from the Defense Department's Tricare health network after the incumbent bidder appealed last summer's award to the company.

The managed-care company was awarded a contract last July covering the U.S. military's North region, supplanting Health Net Inc. (HNT), to provide health services for military members, retirees and families. But the military later began re-evaluating all three of its regional contracts after the Government Accountability Office upheld appeals by Health Net and Humana Inc. (HUM), which also lost its multibillion-dollar account.

Aetna didn't say why it was disqualified. In November, the GAO cited several reasons for sustaining Health Net's appeal of the award to Aetna, including Aetna's hiring of a former Tricare official with knowledge of Health Net's past performance

In a statement Wednesday, Aetna said it was disappointed by the decision, adding that no non-public information was ever used in preparing the bid and that it acted appropriately throughout the procurement process.

The company said it is reviewing the basis for the decision and will look to determine the best path forward.

UnitedHealth Group Inc. (UNH) was to have taken over the South region from Humana on April 1, but Tricare decided to keep all three contractors in place through the end of March 2011 as it sorted out the appeal.

The third contract, which is also up for review, was awarded to incumbent TriWest Healthcare Alliance.

The three regional contracts combined are worth an estimated $55.5 billion over the base and five option periods, according to Tricare, which serves some 9.6 million beneficiaries worldwide.

Humana said it plans to submit a final bid for the next South region contract within 14 days. ""We are eager to move forward with this process,"" said Dave Baker, president and chief executive of Humana Military Healthcare Services.

The company also backed its previous 2010 earnings guidance.

In after-hours trading, Aetna shares were unchanged from their closing price of $29.22, while HealthNet edged up 0.3% to $22.17. Humana's shares rose 1.1% to $47.10.

Among these, autism spectrum disorder (ASD) diagnosis and incidence have drawn considerable attention, particularly within the military health system. A recent study authored by Yeh et al. investigates these dynamics, shedding light on the intricacies of autism diagnosis during a time of unprecedented global disruption.

As the pandemic unfolded, various traditional health care pathways faced substantial barriers when responding to the increasing needs of individuals with ASD. The researchers tasked themselves with analyzing the sheer scope of these challenges, communicating with health care providers and military families to gather anecdotal and empirical evidence about the shifts they experienced. The transition to telehealth models served as a critical focus, presenting both opportunities and hurdles in delivering timely autism assessments and interventions.

In military contexts, where service members’ access to resources can vary widely, analyzing the change in autism diagnoses during the pandemic revealed a stark contrast with previous years. The team discovered that the pandemic brought delays in securing autism evaluations for children, primarily due to restricted access to in-person appointments and ongoing quarantines. Many families reported hesitancy in seeking care amid fears of COVID-19 exposure, which undoubtedly compounded their struggles in accessing necessary supports.

Furthermore, as schools transitioned to virtual platforms, parents suddenly became primary facilitators of their children’s learning and social interaction. This role shift was particularly significant for families of children with autism, who often benefit from structured environments and specialized support. The study highlighted how disrupted routines negatively impacted the developmental progress of many children on the spectrum, leading to increased behavioral challenges and heightened family stress.

Advocacy groups and military organizations engaged in promoting awareness of ASD faced challenges in disseminating information effectively during the pandemic. Through digital means, they endeavored to provide resources to families, but engagement remained sporadic. The researchers posited that the isolation felt by many families could directly correlate with the decline in diagnosis rates within the military health system, as individuals and families navigated unprecedented uncertainties.

The study also scrutinized trends in autism incidence, revealing potential underlying trends that existed prior to the pandemic. While some regions experienced a decrease in new diagnoses, others reported concerning spikes in autism cases post-lockdown. This inconsistency raised essential discussions about how access to care varies across regions and the long-term implications of missed diagnoses.

It’s vital to appreciate how these findings resonate beyond the military health system and into broader health care discussions. Public health infrastructure must adapt to ensure that essential services remain accessible, particularly amidst a crisis like COVID-19. The research drew comparisons and insights from previous health crises, emphasizing the need for proactive, flexible response strategies aimed at ensuring continuity of care for vulnerable populations.

Yeh et al.’s findings encourage a critical examination of the role of technology during the pandemic. Telehealth emerged as a saving grace for many families, enabling them to maintain some level of connection with health professionals. However, the study also raised questions about its limitations, particularly regarding the initial diagnostic assessments that are traditionally reliant on in-person interactions. As a result, the researchers urged stakeholders to investigate hybrid models of care that integrate digital tools with essential in-person consultations.

Maintaining the welfare of children with autism during the pandemic also called for innovative approaches to therapy and educational support. The research team observed that some families adapted by utilizing online resources, yet these solutions were often not universally effective. The disparities in internet access highlighted the digital divide, leaving certain populations at a disadvantage during critical learning and developmental phases.

As the global community emerges from the pandemic, the lessons learned from the military health system’s experience with autism diagnosis must inform future strategies. Stakeholders need to adopt a multifaceted approach that anticipates crises while fortifying pathways to care for individuals with ASD. Policies must aim to ensure that child developmental health remains a priority, even in the face of larger public health emergencies.

In conclusion, the study conducted by Yeh et al. emphasizes that understanding the impact of COVID-19 on autism diagnosis is more than an academic exercise; it has profound implications for clinical practice and public health policy. The ongoing pandemic has illuminated gaps in health care accessibility and necessitated innovative solutions for the persistent challenges faced by families of children with autism. As discussions unfold, the focus must remain on equipping health systems to be resilient in the face of future public health crises while ensuring that individuals with autism receive the timely support they require.

The narrative surrounding COVID-19 and autism diagnosis will continue to evolve, and as such, continuous research is key to informing best practices. The findings could transform how we comprehend the interplay between global events and individual health outcomes, potentially reshaping care paradigms in the long run.

Strong research, collaboration, and advocacy will inevitably lead to the development of a more responsive and inclusive health care system. The experience of navigating the complexities of autism diagnosis during the pandemic reminds us that while challenges abound, opportunities for growth and transformation exist. By applying the insights gleaned from this research, we can work collectively towards fostering a more supportive environment for individuals with autism and their families in the years to come.

With TRICARE Open Season 2025 right around the corner, now is a perfect time to learn about TRICARE’s wide range of coverage options. Knowing the differences will ensure the right coverage for you and your family members.

“There are some differences in the types of plans TRICARE offers,” said Zelly Zim, senior program analyst, Policy & Programs Division, TRICARE Health Plan, at the Defense Health Agency. “Provider preference, out-of-pocket costs, and referrals and pre-authorizations are all factors to consider when making your choice.”

Comparing options

The easiest way to understand different TRICARE plans is to compare them in three simple steps:

1. Use the TRICARE Plan Finder. Answer a few questions and see which plans you may be eligible for.

2. Compare plans using the TRICARE Compare Plans Tool. Note differences in coverage, provider networks, and referral requirements.

3. Review your family’s 2025 costs carefully. 2026 costs will be available in early November.

There’s no need to compare plans if you’re on active duty or have TRICARE For Life. Coverage is automatic for active duty service members. TFL coverage is automatic if you have Medicare Part A and Part B.

TRICARE plans at a glance

TRICARE offers health plans designed to meet your needs. Two of the most common options are TRICARE Prime and TRICARE Select.

TRICARE Prime

TRICARE Prime works like a health maintenance organization. It typically offers lower out-of-pocket costs, but your care is managed through a primary care manager. You’ll usually need referrals for specialty care. If you don't mind a structured approach, TRICARE Prime is a good fit.

TRICARE Select

With TRICARE Select you don’t need a PCM, and you can see any TRICARE-authorized provider without a referral. This plan is good for those who want more flexibility with providers, though it generally has higher out-of-pocket costs.

If you’re interested in comparing TRICARE Prime to TRICARE Select, check out the TRICARE Open Season roadmap.

Other options

In addition to these options, TRICARE offers several others that may be a good fit, depending on where you live:

Overseas

For those stationed or living abroad, TRICARE offers both TRICARE Prime Overseas and TRICARE Select Overseas plans, depending on your location and preferences. (Note: TRICARE Prime Overseas is only available to ADSMs, activated National Guard and Reserve members, and their command-sponsored family members.)

These plans follow similar rules as in the U.S. but are tailored to those living overseas.

US Family Health Plan

This plan is available in certain U.S. regions. USFHP allows you to receive care through a network of nonprofit systems that give personalized care in a community-based setting.

Live in the Atlanta or Tampa areas?

Starting in January 2026, the TRICARE Prime Demo by CareSource Military & Veterans will bring more choices to eligible beneficiaries living in the Atlanta and Tampa areas. Enrollees will get care through CSMV's network of care providers.

Benefits of enrolling include:

• If you’re a retiree, a retiree family member, or survivor, your enrollment fees are waived for the first 12 months, regardless of when you enroll with CSMV. After the first year, you'll pay TRICARE Prime enrollment fees.

• You won’t need referrals to see network providers.

Check your eligibility and explore the benefits—but be sure to enroll by the TRICARE Open Season deadline to secure coverage beginning Jan. 1, 2026

What about dental and vision?

You may be eligible for dental or vision coverage through the Federal Employees Dental and Vision Insurance Program. These plans are separate from your TRICARE health coverage.

To enroll in FEDVIP:

• You must be eligible under your beneficiary category.

• You must be enrolled in a TRICARE health plan to qualify for FEDVIP vision coverage.

Federal Benefits Open Season runs Nov. 10 through Dec. 8—note the earlier end date compared to TRICARE Open Season.

Defense Health Agency officials have launched an effort to bring back Medicare-eligible Tricare for Life military patients to their treatment facilities, the Pentagon’s top doctor said this week.

They are prioritizing bringing back these retirees and their dependents back to 21 military treatment facilities, Dr. Stephen Ferrara, acting assistant secretary of defense for health affairs, told a Military Officers Association of America conference Oct. 28.

“Those are the folks we really want. We love to have our seniors at MTFs,” Ferrara said.

They’ve chosen the 21 locations, based on the specialists available and the capability of the facilities, he said. The locations are reportedly larger, major military medical centers. Defense Health Agency officials would not answer a Military Times question about the specific locations, saying they cannot provide any information until the government shutdown ends “because it’s not an excepted topic.”

In various roles over the last 30-plus years, including 25 years as an active duty Navy surgeon, Ferrara said, he has watched the “whipsawing back and forth” of these patients, in terms of their ability to get care at MTFs or being forced out into the private sector to get their health care.

“It’s frustrating for the patients,” he said, and as a surgeon, “those are the patients I want to see” because older patients have more complex and advanced conditions.

[MOAA PREMIUM/LIFE MEMBER EXCLUSIVE: Transitioning Into Medicare and TRICARE For Life]

Those MTFs are platforms where medical providers sharpen their skills as they take care of a wide variety of patients, he said, and it is a key element of readiness.

“I focus on readiness, because that’s what I owe the secretary,” Ferrara said, adding that one way of achieving that is by having “high-volume, high-complexity, busy MTFs.”

Defense Health Agency officials could not provide information about whether this effort is related to last year’s directive from former Deputy Secretary of Defense Kathleen Hicks, ordering sweeping changes to boost staffing at military medical facilities, increase access to care for benefits and attract more patients back to MTFs.

Hicks cited problems that had led to “chronically understaffed military treatment facilities and dental treatment facilities.

At a Health and Human Services (HHS) Subcommittee hearing, Department of Legislative Services analyst Yashoda Araya presented the Maryland Military Department's fiscal 2026 budget, reporting an overall allowance of $45,500,000 and a net increase of about $1,800,000 after proposed fiscal 2025 deficiency appropriations.

The Department of Legislative Services (DLS) analysis identified staffing and program risks as the most significant issues. Araya said the fiscal 2026 allowance ‘‘increases by $1,800,000 after accounting for the two proposed fiscal 25 deficiency appropriations totaling about $2,600,000’’ and noted personnel costs account for roughly 54% of the department's budget. The analysis reported 49 vacancies as of Dec. 31, 2024, nine of which had existed for more than a year; DLS recommended deleting five of the long‑term vacant positions to reduce general funds by $86,000 and federal funds by about $196,000.

Why this matters: staffing shortfalls affect operations across the Maryland Army and Air National Guard, and the DLS requested committee narrative requiring a report on the status of vacant positions, planned or enacted changes to those positions, and recruitment efforts.

Key program details and concerns

- Free State Challenge Academy (FCA): Araya said the DLS request highlights FCA operations and performance measures; FCA's full cohort capacity is 300 cadets and the program typically graduates roughly 200 cadets per year. The DLS exhibit shows FCA enrolled 66 students in fiscal 2024 and reported a GED pass rate of 34% that year—the lowest in the 2020–2024 series. DLS noted instructional‑staff reductions in fiscal 2024 tied to funding shortfalls that affected cadet enrollment and recommended a committee narrative requesting a status update on the renovation project and staffing plan for FCA.

- TRICARE premium reimbursement program: DLS reported about 950 eligible National Guard members participated in the program, roughly 70% in the Army National Guard and 30% in the Air National Guard. Araya noted Chapter 745 of 2024 removed a prior $60 monthly reimbursement cap; after the change the monthly reimbursement cap rose to $150. DLS asked for a report on program participation, claims, average premium amounts for fiscal 2026, and plans to increase enrollment; Araya recommended the committee request a report.

Department response and Q&A

Dave Palucci, chief of staff for the Maryland Military Department, thanked the committee and emphasized staffing and the agency's people as the department's most critical asset. Palucci said the department had filled seven of the long‑term vacancies and had two selections pending. He highlighted the Healthcare for Heroes program, saying it ‘‘has executed, exceeded our expectations and has enrolled 75 percent of all eligible service members.’’ He also described FCA as ‘‘the only fully preventative program in the juvenile space managed by the state of Maryland,’’ noting its 22‑week residential curriculum and tuition‑free enrollment.

On several points the department deferred to the governor's office. When asked by Senator Hettleman about the announced transition of aircraft from the D.C. Air National Guard to the Maryland Air National Guard, Palucci said the announcement came from the governor's office and the department was not yet in a position to discuss acquisition details or manning and equipment transfers.

Discussion vs. decision

- Discussion only: staffing levels and vacancy impacts, FCA enrollment and GED outcomes, the status of the FCA renovation, and the governor's announced fighter squadron transition (department deferred specifics).

- Direction/request: DLS requested committee narrative for a report on vacancies and FCA renovation status; the committee chair asked the department to provide a written update and timeline for FCA renovations.

- Formal action: none recorded at the hearing.

What happens next

DLS recommended committee narrative and follow‑up reporting on vacant positions, FCA renovation progress and staffing, and TRICARE reimbursement participation and claims. The department signaled it will provide details requested by the chair and the DLS inquiries.

Ending: The hearing for the Military Department concluded with the chair thanking department staff and moving to the Department of Health overview.

Backtested performance is not an indicator of future actual results. The results reflect performance of a strategy not historically offered to investors and does not represent returns that any investor actually attained. Backtested results are calculated by the retroactive application of a model constructed on the basis of historical data and based on assumptions integral to the model which may or may not be testable and are subject to losses. General assumptions include: XYZ firm would have been able to purchase the securities recommended by the model and the markets were sufficiently liquid to permit all trading. Changes in these assumptions may have a material impact on the backtested returns presented. Certain assumptions have been made for modeling purposes and are unlikely to be realized. No representations and warranties are made as to the reasonableness of the assumptions. This information is provided for illustrative purposes only. Backtested performance is developed with the benefit of hindsight and has inherent limitations. Specifically, backtested results do not reflect actual trading or the effect of material economic and market factors on the decision-making process. Since trades have not actually been executed, results may have under- or over-compensated for the impact, if any, of certain market factors, such as lack of liquidity, and may not reflect the impact that certain economic or market factors may have had on the decision-making process. Further, backtesting allows the security selection methodology to be adjusted until past returns are maximized. Actual performance may differ significantly from backtested performance. Backtested results are adjusted to reflect the reinvestment of dividends and other income and, except where otherwise indicated, are presented gross-of fees and do not include the effect of backtested transaction costs, management fees, performance fees or expenses, if applicable.
