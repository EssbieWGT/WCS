The reaccreditation extends through 2028 and encompasses TAMC, the Desmond T. Doss Health Clinic, and Warrior Ohana Medical Home.

The Joint Commission's rigorous evaluation process assessed the medical center's adherence to national healthcare standards across critical areas including patient safety protocols, infection prevention and control, medication management systems, and clinical staff qualifications. As the nation's premier healthcare accreditation organization, The Joint Commission's seal represents the gold standard for healthcare quality and safety.

""This achievement reflects our organization's evolution from reactive compliance to proactive system transformation,"" said Lt. Col. Ernestina dela Pena-Guba, assistant deputy commander for quality services. ""The survey validated our strengths while providing a clear roadmap for continued excellence.""

The successful outcome builds on extensive preparation, including a 2024 Defense Health Agency Accreditation Assist Visit that helped identify improvement opportunities and strengthen operational processes. Survey teams with decades of combined healthcare accreditation experience specifically commended TAMC's systematic approach to addressing previous findings and integrating evidence-based practices into daily operations.

Key factors in the successful reaccreditation included:

• Implementation of 24/7 quality and safety protocols

• Comprehensive staff training and development programs

• Enhanced coordination between clinical and administrative teams

• Systematic closure of identified gaps in care processes

• Integration of best practices across all service lines

The accreditation ensures TAMC will continue delivering world-class healthcare to active-duty service members, military families, and veterans while maintaining medical readiness for Army, Navy, Air Force, Marine Corps and Space Force personnel throughout the Pacific region.

Survey teams consistently recognized the professionalism, expertise, and responsiveness demonstrated by frontline clinical staff, department leaders, and support teams across all facilities. The Quality and Safety team provided critical operational oversight, system analysis, and leadership support throughout the preparation and survey process.

""Every team member contributed to this success through their daily commitment to safer processes and exceptional patient care,"" dela Pena-Guba said. ""This reaccreditation validates our relentless pursuit of healthcare excellence and continuous improvement.""

The Joint Commission Gold Seal of Approval demonstrates TAMC's ongoing commitment to transparency, accountability, and the highest standards of patient care and safety.

“Our commitment to quality and safety backs up our promise to every service member, family member, retiree, and veteran that walks through our doors,” said Col. William Bimson, commander, TAMC. “Our hospital staff are the embodiment of the dual professional capability of providing exceptional medical services as healthcare professionals, while generating, training, and sustaining a highly effective joint medical force as a profession of the U.S. Army. Military medicine is deterrence, and if deterrence fails, we are there to sustain and protect the force, allowing them to fight and win when the nation calls.”

Today, TAMC is the only federal tertiary care hospital in the Pacific Basin. It supports 264,000 local active duty and retired military personnel, their families, and veteran beneficiaries. In addition, the referral population includes 171,000 military personnel, family members, veteran beneficiaries, residents of nine U.S. affiliated jurisdictions (American Samoa, Guam, and the former Trust Territories), and forward-deployed forces in more than 40 countries throughout the Pacific.",https://d1ldvf68ux039x.cloudfront.net/thumbs/photos/2508/9233592/1000w_q95.jpg,N,0.0,2025-08-01 19:56:07.173273

Besides Transcom, other personnel involved in the exercise are from U.S. Northern Command, U.S. Indo-Pacific Command, Air Force aeromedical evacuation crews, Army Reserve Medical Command critical care air transport teams, Department of Veterans Affairs, Defense Health Agency, Department of Health and Human Services, as well as other regional health care and emergency response teams.

""Ultimate Caduceus is a great opportunity for DHA to highlight our ability to deliver both health care to warfighters and capability to combatant commanders as a combat support agency. At the enterprise level, we remain focused on aligning military health and private sector resources against warfighter requirements and optimizing patient demand on transportation assets,"" said Anthony Ross, Defense Health Agency liaison officer to Transcom.

This exercise actively tested how the emergency response teams work together as part of the National Disaster Medical System to save lives during a potential national crisis.

""Success to me is to increase interoperability across medical teams and systems so we can provide the highest level of care to those who need it most,"" Backus said.

As the DOD's sole manager for global patient movement, Transcom leads aeromedical evacuation missions using high-capacity aircraft and en route care teams to transport personnel from the field to definitive care anywhere in the world.

""This joint and combined DOD, interagency and civilian partner medical team is something to be proud of and you can be assured they'll move mountains to bring premier care to those who need it,"" Backus said.

“National Guard and Reserve members have different TRICARE coverage options when they transition between active and inactive status,” said Brian Smith, senior health system specialist, TRICARE Health Plan, at the Defense Health Agency. “TRICARE encourages you to review your health coverage options to ensure you maintain continuous health coverage. Do this prior to coming on active duty orders for more than 30 days and deactivating.”

What are my TRICARE options when I activate?

You get the same health care benefits as active duty service members when you’re activated for more than 30 days on qualifying orders. Your service updates your TRICARE eligibility in the Defense Enrollment Eligibility Reporting System. Your service does this each time your duty status changes.

Did you receive delayed effective-date, active duty orders for more than 30 days in support of a contingency operation or under 12304b? Then you get early TRICARE eligibility up to 180 days from the date your active duty begins. Do you want more information? Visit TRICARE Pre-Activation Benefits.

Here are things to consider:

Your TRICARE health plan. You’ll be automatically enrolled in TRICARE Prime as an active duty service member. You’ll have an unassigned primary care manager. This means you can see any TRICARE-authorized provider. You’ll follow your command’s guidance on any additional enrollment requirements when you arrive to your final duty station. The following TRICARE Prime health plans may be an option:

TRICARE Prime

TRICARE Prime Remote

TRICARE Prime Overseas

Dental coverage changes. Did you have TRICARE Dental Program coverage prior to activation? You’ll be automatically enrolled in the Active Duty Dental Program. This is described in the TRICARE Active Duty Dental Program Brochure. Your enrolled family members keep their TDP coverage with lower premiums. Family members who aren’t enrolled can join anytime.

Are you wondering how to get care while activated for more than 30 days? Do you have TRICARE Prime?

You can get routine, urgent, and emergency care from a military hospital or clinic or a civilian TRICARE-authorized provider.

Referrals and pre-authorizations are required for specialty care.

Do your family members have TRICARE Select coverage?

They can get care from any TRICARE-authorized provider.

They can get care at a military hospital or clinic if space is available.

They don’t need referrals in most situations. They may need pre-authorizations for some health care services.

Do you live and work more than 50 miles from a military hospital or clinic? Your family members may enroll in TRICARE Prime Remote. You can check to see if you’re in a remote location—use the TRICARE Plan Finder. Your family members get most of their care from a TRICARE-authorized provider with TRICARE Prime Remote.

What about line of duty care?

Line of duty care is limited to ailments incurred or aggravated during a period of qualified duty 30 days or less. This includes injuries sustained while traveling to and from and staying overnight at a duty station. Your unit is responsible for initiating an LOD determination request.

LOD isn’t a government lifetime health plan. It’s a special eligibility status to treat a specific condition for up to one year. The process for getting LOD care depends on where you’re located. Check out Line of Duty Care for Service Members to learn more.

How about when I deactivate?

Once your active duty period ends, your TRICARE coverage options depend on the type of orders you were under.

Were your active duty orders more than 30 days in support of a contingency operation or under 12304b? If so, you’d be eligible for Transitional Assistance Management Program coverage for 180 days. You and your eligible family members are covered as active duty family members. Your TRICARE health plan options depend on where you live with TAMP coverage. TRICARE Prime Remote isn’t available during TAMP. You must act and submit your new enrollment request within 90 days from your last date on active duty. If you fail to do so, you’ll only be eligible for coverage at a military hospital or clinic.

After TAMP coverage ends, or if you weren’t eligible for TAMP and your active duty period ends, you may have options. You may buy TRICARE Reserve Select coverage if you qualify. Or you may be eligible for Continued Health Care Benefit Program coverage. You may also seek health care insurance through your state’s Health Insurance Marketplace.

You maintain TRICARE pharmacy benefits during TAMP or other TRICARE health plan options.

Is there dental coverage after deactivation?

Active duty dental benefits continue during TAMP.

Your TDP coverage and premiums return to regular rates when TAMP or other TRICARE coverage ends.

Schena illustrates how, in certain circumstances, payments to marketing intermediaries for lab referrals can lead to criminal EKRA liability.
Key Takeaways Payment to marketers, or other intermediaries, that tracks to referral volumes can violate EKRA.
To interpret the meaning of “induce a referral” in the EKRA context, the Ninth Circuit turned to AKS jurisprudence.
The Schena court analyzed many of the same cases as the Seventh Circuit in United States v. Sorenson—a criminal AKS case covered in our May 2025 client alert.","In a matter of first impression, the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals interpreted the scope of the 2018 Eliminating Kickbacks in Recovery Act (EKRA) in the context of a lab operator who allegedly paid marketers to induce referrals for “medically dubious allergy tests.” United States v. Schena, No. 23-2989, slip op. at 4 (9th Cir. July 11, 2025). As relevant here, EKRA penalizes anyone who “knowingly and willfully . . . pays or offers any remuneration (including kickback, bribe, or rebate) directly or indirectly, overtly, in cash or in kind . . . to induce a referral of an individual to a recovery home, clinical treatment facility, or laboratory.” 18 U.S.C. § 220(a)(2)(A). EKRA is a relatively new statute, and the Schena opinion is the first time a federal appellate court has rendered an interpretation.

In our May 2025 client alert, we discussed two defense-friendly Anti-Kickback Statute (AKS) and False Claims Act (FCA) opinions, which narrowed the scope of advertising and marketing conduct that runs afoul of the AKS. While both the AKS and EKRA criminally punish paying remuneration for inducing referrals for certain medical services reimbursed by federal health care programs (e.g., Medicare, Medicaid, TriCare), a key difference is that EKRA is not limited to federal health care programs; EKRA’s prohibitions extend to referring patients for specific covered services reimbursed through private health insurance or self-pay. An EKRA conviction can carry up to 10 years’ imprisonment, up to a $200,000 fine, or both, for each occurrence. 18 U.S.C. § 220(a). Schena illustrates how, in certain circumstances, payments to marketing intermediaries for lab referrals can lead to criminal EKRA liability.

Key Takeaways

Payment to marketers, or other intermediaries, that tracks to referral volumes can violate EKRA. There is no requirement that payments be made to a physician or other healthcare provider who interfaces directly with patients.

A percentage-based compensation structure for marketers is not a per se EKRA violation. However, percentage-based payments made to marketers who are directed to mislead medical decisionmakers about the nature of and need for the covered service would violate EKRA.

Borrowing from criminal law and AKS precedent, to “induce a referral” under EKRA means “wrongful causation” or “undue influence”—e.g., where, in Schena, a marketer effectively takes over the clinical decision-making role of the referring physician, payment to the marketer constitutes “induc[ing] a referral.”

The defendant in Schena operated a lab focused on blood tests for allergies and, later, for COVID antibodies. He was convicted of one count of conspiracy to violate EKRA and two counts of substantive EKRA violations, among other healthcare and securities fraud offenses, and sentenced to eight years’ imprisonment and ordered to pay more than $24 million restitution for billing more than $77 million to public and private insurers for allegedly unnecessary tests (for which insurers paid only around $2.7 million because many claims were denied or paid at lower rates). The evidence presented to the jury at trial showed that (i) defendant directed marketers to misrepresent to physicians who did not have allergy testing expertise that these blood tests were more accurate than and superior to industry-standard allergy and COVID tests, with the goal of inducing referrals, and (ii) marketers were paid a percentage of the revenue they brought in. Before trial, the district court had denied defendant’s motion to dismiss the EKRA counts, rejecting the argument that his conduct did not violate EKRA as a matter of law where the payments were made only to marketing intermediaries, not to the doctors making lab referrals. See Schena, slip op. at 5-8.

On appeal, the Ninth Circuit considered (a) “whether EKRA applies to payments made to marketing intermediaries, as opposed to the referring doctors or persons who otherwise interact directly with patients”; and (b) if so, “what it means to ‘induce a referral’ in the context of that type of payment relationship.” Id. at 10. The court concluded that, “at a minimum, when percentage-based payments are made to marketing agents who are directed to mislead those making the referrals about the nature of and need for the covered medical services, those payments would violate EKRA.” Id. at 18. The court did not, however, elaborate on other scenarios that could violate EKRA, noting that the instant case represented a “sufficient” but “not a necessary set of circumstances for establishing undue influence.” Id. at 18-19.

To interpret the meaning of “induce a referral” in the EKRA context, the Ninth Circuit turned to AKS jurisprudence. The Schena court analyzed many of the same cases as the Seventh Circuit in United States v. Sorenson—a criminal AKS case covered in our May 2025 client alert. Compare Schena, slip op. at 16-18, with United States v. Sorenson, 134 F.4th 493, 500-02 (7th Cir. 2025). In overturning the lower court’s conviction, the Sorenson court identified a narrow circumstance (not present in that case) in which a non-physician could exert such influence over the medical decisionmaker as to render the physician’s signature merely a rubber stamp. In Schena, the Ninth Circuit—without citing Sorenson—determined that it was confronted with this type of narrow circumstance in which the marketing intermediary effectively took over the role of the referring physician, such that payments to the marketer induced the referrals.

Schena and Sorenson demonstrate that EKRA liability, like AKS liability, turns on the specific facts of each case. As EKRA caselaw develops, practitioners should expect courts to continue to look to AKS precedent for guidance. In the meantime, as Schena cautions, “companies and marketing agents seeking to steer clear of EKRA may consider whether it is preferable to structure their compensation arrangements in accordance with the statute’s safe harbor.” Schena, slip op. at 18 (citing safe harbor where “payment is not determined by or does not vary by—(A) the number of individuals referred . . .; (B) the number of tests or procedures performed; or (C) the amount billed to or received from . . . the health care benefit program,” 18 U.S.C. § 220(b)(2)).",https://jdsupra-static.s3.amazonaws.com/profile-images/og.16153_4556.jpg,N,0.0,2025-08-01 17:56:10.854605

Many of these non-laboratory activities play vital roles in DHA R&D-MRDC’s day-to-day operations.
That's why I keep coming back every year to speak at the GEMS program.” Johnson has a doctorate in cell biology and immunology from the University of Cincinnati College of Medicine.","FORT DETRICK, Md. – High school and college students participating as near-peer mentors in this year’s Gains in the Education of Mathematics and Science summer program had the opportunity to hear from two senior Defense Health Agency Research & Development-Medical Research and Development Command leaders about their scientific career journeys and to ask them about the benefits of pursuing careers in STEM. In addition to offering valuable career advice to budding young scientists, the engagement also supported DHA R&D-MRDC’s mission to cultivate the future workforce that will ensure DHA R&D-MRDC remains in the forefront of military medical research and innovation.

Dr. Carrie Quinn, Deputy to DHA R&D-MRDC’s Commanding General, and Col Jacob Johnson, a Fellow in the U.S. Army Medical Research Institute of Infectious Diseases Biosafety and Biosecurity Program, spoke about their career influences, educational background, military research, and leadership assignments to the GEMS near-peer mentors, who provide academic guidance to elementary school students participating in the annual extracurricular STEM education program. Quinn and Johnson were among a dozen subject matter experts from across the command who spoke to students and mentors throughout the five-week program.

In her discussion, Quinn emphasized that students could follow many paths to a career in science, citing her own eclectic journey as an example. After working as a physical therapist and emergency medical technician, she joined the U.S. Army so that she could pursue a position as a research scientist at the U.S. Army Research Institute of Environmental Medicine, part of DHA R&D-MRDC. There, she led a team conducting research into human performance in extreme environments. As director of USARIEM’s GEMS program, she was famous for greeting the students with high-fives every morning as they arrived at the front gate of the Natick Soldier Systems Center.

“There's no normal pathway. It's the pathway you want to follow,” said Quinn. “I followed almost none of the normal trajectory because I was willing to say yes to opportunities that sounded maybe a little bit weird. Every next job I've had has been better than what I expected it to be, and the number of doors that each opportunity has opened has been spectacular. So, don’t be afraid to say ‘yes.’”

In addition to conducting research in military medicine, Quinn has long been interested in its strategic policy aspects as well. Prior to joining DHA R&D-MRDC, she served in the Office of the Undersecretary of Defense for Research and Engineering as a senior advisor for critical and emerging technologies. She also worked for the Defense Intelligence Agency, where she served on special assignment to the White House Situation Room supporting the President, Vice President, and the National Security Advisor.

Quinn stressed that rapid advances in science and technology such as artificial intelligence in decision making, organoids for biological testing, and drones in combat will require tomorrow’s scientists to have a strong grounding in ethics.

“You are going to confront so many more ethical questions in your STEM careers than what I've ever had to deal with up to this point,” said Quinn. “Know your moral compass and do not stray from that. We have a saying in the Army: ‘the hard right and the easy wrong,’ If you choose to go with the easy wrong, you'll lose every time, and you’ll lose the faith and trust of your followers. And getting that back is almost a hundred percent not going to happen.”

Johnson emphasized that a STEM education can be parlayed into career opportunities beyond conducting research in an academic laboratory. STEM skills and knowledge are valuable assets for careers in fields as varied as publishing, technology transfer, program management, policy, and even financial services. Many of these non-laboratory activities play vital roles in DHA R&D-MRDC’s day-to-day operations.

“The career space today is completely different than it was decades ago, when I was in school, and it's constantly changing,” said Johnson. “The idea that you have to wear a white coat and work at a lab bench is only true if that’s the path you want to pursue. There are so many options out there, just waiting for you.”

To explore those opportunities, Johnson encouraged the near-peer mentors to actively seek out people in those fields who would be willing to share their experience and knowledge and introduce them to colleagues who can help them get a foot in the door.

“If I didn't have the folks who assisted me since the seventh grade, I don't know that I would be here right now,” said Johnson. “They inspired me when I was having tough moments, they believed in me when I doubted myself, and they encouraged me when I frustrated. That's why I keep coming back every year to speak at the GEMS program.”

Johnson has a doctorate in cell biology and immunology from the University of Cincinnati College of Medicine. After completing the Army Medical Department Officer’s Basic Course, the Army assigned him to DHA R&D-MRDC’s Walter Reed Army Institute of Research as a principal research investigator. Prior to his fellowship, he was director of the DOD Blast Injury Research Coordinating Office and the Joint Trauma Analysis & Prevention of Injury in Combat program office, located at DHA R&D-MRDC’s headquarters at Fort Detrick. As a biosafety and biosecurity program fellow, Johnson is gaining practical experience in how to conduct operations in high-security environments of the DOD’s most complex biosafety level 3 and 4 laboratories.

Johnson says workforce development is a vital prerequisite for DHA R&D-MRDC to be able to carry out its mission to improve Warfighter survivability and lethality, enhance force protection and readiness, drive medical modernization throughout the DHA enterprise, and contribute to deterrence and posture at the theater and global levels.

“I look at programs like GEMS as the lifeblood of our scientific bench,” said Johnson. “We are planting a seed with future scientists who could go on to impact government science, whether they end up wearing the uniform or serving as a civilian or contractor, or working with one of our partners in the larger community of interest. The near-peer mentors who participate in GEMS are getting a full-spectrum learning opportunity that will prepare them for their professional education and hopefully inspire them to become lifelong learners. Who knows what game-changing medicines or devices they could create?”",https://d1ldvf68ux039x.cloudfront.net/thumbs/photos/2508/9232865/1000w_q95.jpg,N,0.0,2025-08-01 15:56:07.097585

BY: ANDREW COLTON | Editor and Publisher | BOCA RATON, FL (BocaNewsNow.com) (Copyright © 2025 MetroDesk Media, LLC) — BocaNewsNow.com has confirmed that Cemhan Biricik, a homeowner in Boca Bridges, is the subject of the FBI raid conducted early Thursday morning in the gated West Boca Raton community. Biricik was taken into custody and is now facing more than 50 charges related to COVID-19 fraud stemming from an allegedly bogus COVID testing operation that he ran.

Agents conducted the raid at 9623 Macchiato Avenue which is the $4,725,000 home in Boca Bridges that Biricik owns with his wife. The United States Department of Justice immediately filed an order with the court in Palm Beach County asserting a claim on the property which does not appear to have a mortgage.

Here is the official statement issued to BocaNewsNow.com by the FBI Thursday afternoon:

>> Two individuals were charged for their involvement in a $500 million, nationwide scheme that involved billing Medicare, Medicaid, TRICARE, and other health insurance programs for COVID-19 testing services that were never rendered, United States Attorney Jerome F. Gorgon Jr. announced today.

Cemhan “Jimmy” Biricik (age 46) of Boca Raton Florida, and Dr. Martin Perlin (age 74) of Fairfield, Connecticut were charged with conspiracy to commit health care fraud and more than 50 substantive counts of health care fraud. Biricik was the sole member and Chief Executive Officer of Fast Lab Technologies, LLC (Fast Lab). Dr. Perlin was Fast Lab’s Medical Director and provider responsible for ordering the majority of the tests. Both defendants were arrested this morning.

According to the Indictment, during the Covid-19 pandemic, New York-based Fast Lab operated a website offering “free” covid tests. When individuals went to the website to order tests, they were asked to provide their insurance information. Fast Lab then used this insurance information to fraudulently bill Medicare, Medicaid, TRICARE and numerous private insurances for both antigen (“rapid”) and PCR (“laboratory) tests, across multiple dates for each beneficiary. Specifically, Fast Lab’s claims represented that (1) the antigen tests had been observed by medical professionals, (2) saliva samples were collected by medical professionals, and (3) PCR testing was performed on those samples. In reality, the vast majority of antigen tests—if taken at all—were taken at home and not observed by medical professionals; saliva samples were never collected nor returned to Fast Lab; and PCR testing was never performed. Dr. Perlin was the ordering physician for these tests, despite not having a treating relationship with the beneficiaries. Further, Fast Lab would regularly submit insurance claims before the test kits were even delivered to the beneficiaries. In total, Biricik billed or caused to be billed more than $500 million in claims and was paid more than $50 million.

Gorgon was joined in the announcement by Special Agent in Charge Mario Pinto, U.S. Department of Health and Human Services Office of Inspector General (HHS-OIG), Chicago Regional Office; Special Agent in Charge Cheyvoryea Gibson, Federal Bureau of Investigation, Detroit Division; Special Agent in Charge Derek M. Holt of the U.S. Office of Personnel Management Office of the Inspector General; Acting Assistant Secretary of Labor for the Employee Benefits Security Administration Janet Dhillon (DOL-EBSA); Detroit Division; Acting Special Agent in Charge Christopher Silvestro, Defense Criminal Investigative Service (DCIS); Special Agent in Charge Charles Miller, Detroit Field Office, Internal Revenue Service – Criminal Investigation (IRS-CI); Special Agent in Charge Megan Howell, Great Lakes Region, U.S. Department of Labor, Office of Inspector General (DOL-OIG); Acting Inspector in Charge Sean McStravick, U.S. Postal Inspection Service (USPIS); Owen Cypher, U.S. Marshal for the Eastern District of Michigan and Michigan Attorney General Dana Nessel, Medicaid Fraud Control Unit (MFCU).

The public is reminded that an Indictment is not evidence of guilt. The defendants are presumed innocent and entitled to a fair trial at which the government has the burden of proving guilt beyond a reasonable doubt.

This case is being investigated by Special Agents from HHS-OIG, FBI, OPM-OIG, DOL-EBSA, DCIS, MFCU, IRS-CI, DOL-OIG, USPIS, and the U.S. Marshal’s Service. It is being prosecuted by Assistant U.S. Attorneys Regina R. McCullough and Ryan A. Particka. Assistant United States Attorney Ryan T. Nees of the United States Attorney’s Office for the Southern District of New York also provided assistance. <<",https://i0.wp.com/bocanewsnow.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/IMG_4367.jpeg,N,0.0,2025-08-01 15:56:14.124758

• Zynex (ZYXI) crashes to $1.25, a 43.9% drop from $2.23

• Intraday range collapses to $1.24–$2.11, with 1.84M shares traded

• 52-week low of $1.24 nearly reached, dynamic PE at -0.62 signals distress

• Sector peers mixed as Zynex’s freefall defies broader healthcare equipment trends

Zynex’s stock has experienced a historic intraday selloff, trading near its 52-week low amid a lack of clear catalysts. With technical indicators confirming a bearish breakdown and sector-wide uncertainty, traders are left scrambling to decode the move. This collapse raises urgent questions about liquidity, earnings fallout, and leadership shifts.

Earnings Miss and Leadership Shake-Up Trigger Liquidity-Driven Selloff

ZYXI’s 43.9% intraday freefall stems from a confluence of technical breakdowns and absent positive catalysts. The stock opened at $2.11, immediately testing the 200-day moving average ($5.25), a critical resistance level. With the 52-week low ($1.24) in sight and Bollinger Bands tightening (lower band at $2.13), the price accelerated toward the lower band. The Q2 earnings report revealed a 55.3% revenue drop to $22.29M and a $0.66/share loss, while leadership changes and suspended guidance created uncertainty. MACD histogram (-0.0043) and RSI (49.5) signal oversold conditions, yet the move lacks a clear news trigger. The absence of company-specific updates and the sector’s muted response (-1.24% for Medtronic) suggests a liquidity-driven selloff, likely from short-covering or forced liquidation.

Healthcare Equipment Sector Afloat as Zynex Drowns

The Health Care Equipment sector remains mixed, with Medtronic (MDT) down 1.12% and no clear correlation to ZYXI’s collapse. While sector peers like Baxter and NeoGenomics report earnings and product launches, Zynex’s freefall appears isolated. The broader sector’s focus on regulatory updates and EU tariffs contrasts with ZYXI’s internal challenges, suggesting the selloff stems from company-specific factors rather than macro trends.

Navigating ZYXI’s Technical Abyss: ETFs and Strict Stop-Loss Discipline

• 200-day MA: $5.25 (far above current price)

• RSI: 49.5 (oversold but no immediate reversal)

• Bollinger Bands: $2.13 (lower) vs. $2.64 (upper)

• MACD: 0.016 (bullish) vs. signal line 0.020 (bearish)

Technical indicators paint a dire picture for ZYXI. The stock is entrenched in a long-term bearish trend (K-line pattern) and has breached critical support levels. With no options chain to leverage, traders must rely on ETFs or sector exposure. The lack of leveraged ETF data complicates directional bets, but short-term volatility suggests a focus on strict stop-loss discipline. Key levels to watch: $1.30 (52-week low) and $1.35 (next support). Aggressive short-sellers may consider a 5% downside scenario (ST = $1.235), but liquidity risks remain high.

Backtest Zynex Stock Performance

The ZYXI ETF has experienced a -44% intraday plunge, and the backtest results show a mixed performance in the following days. The 3-day win rate is 52.47%, the 10-day win rate is 52.83%, and the 30-day win rate is 48.99%. The maximum return during the backtest period was 0.32%, which occurred on day 4 after the intraday plunge.",https://www.ainvest.com/wencai-ssr/og-image-news-20240226.png,N,0.0,2025-08-01 17:56:20.331814

Ryan said that KACH would be downgraded from a community hospital where patients can receive high-quality inpatient treatment into what is effectively an urgent care under a proposed plan by President Donald Trump that would downsize 17 military treatment facilities.

“As the first West Point graduate to represent the Academy in Congress, I have a solemn duty to ensure that the entire West Point community – the cadets, active service members, retirees, and their families – have access to high-quality health care. I’ve also experienced the exceptional care at Keller firsthand, so I know how devastating this closure would be,” said Congressman Pat Ryan. “We should be working together to improve medical care for our military community – not degrading it further.”

KACH provides a range of health care services for the cadets and military personnel stationed at West Point, including inpatient and surgical care.

Without the inpatient unit, in particular the orthopedic capabilities, cadets will have to travel at least 40 minutes to the next closest facility. In a letter to Smith, Ryan (D, NY-18) wrote, in part: “Proposing such a plan is a dereliction of your duty and a slap in the face to the countless cadets, soldiers, retirees, and family members of the West Point community who sacrifice so much for our country.

“I believe my accomplishments at the 2025 ATA World Championships demonstrate the best of two worlds: service to country and mastery of self.”","FORT DETRICK, Md. – Lethality and readiness are the driving forces behind innovation in military medicine at the Defense Health Agency Research & Development-Medical Research and Development Command. These principles not only guide the development of life-saving vaccines, pharmaceuticals, medical devices, and equipment but also serve as a standard of excellence for the individuals who serve at the command. Col. Robert Carter, DHA R&D-MRDC’s chief of staff, recently exemplified these principles by earning top honors at the 2025 American Taekwondo Association International World Championships.

Drs. Robert and Kirti Carter, along with their daughter, Rajshri, embody a family-focused commitment to ATA Martial Arts, earning their black belts together and achieving numerous state and district titles while navigating the challenges of frequent military relocations. Their journey, which began in 2017 at an ATA school in Orlando, Florida, exemplifies the ATA motto, “A family that kicks together, stays together,” highlighting how martial arts can unite families and inspire excellence across generations.

At the 2025 ATA International World Championships, held July 22-27 in Phoenix, Carter secured gold medals in both creative and Xtreme forms and silver medals in traditional sparring and Xtreme weapons. The annual event is one of the largest and most prestigious martial arts tournaments in the world, drawing more than 3,000 elite martial artists from over 25 countries.

Carter’s performance was a standout in this world-class competition. Grandmaster MK Lee, the presiding grandmaster of ATA Martial Arts, described Carter as “a warrior, someone who is willing to express true feeling in action.” Judges praised his precise, high-energy forms and strategic sparring, as well as his Xtreme forms and weapons routines, which combine acrobatic technique with martial application and performance flair.

“Winning isn’t just about crossing the finish line first — it’s about the years of grit, sacrifice, and relentless belief that got you there,” said Lt. Col. (Ret.) Noel Lynkew, 2024 World Champion.

“As a teammate, he’s sharp, steady, and always has your back, just like in the dojo. You couldn’t ask for a better partner in or out of the ring,” said Col. (Ret.) Marion Grant, 2024 World Champion.

“Col. Carter embodies the spirit of the ATA — discipline, perseverance, and excellence,” said Uriah Breunig, owner of Infinity Martial Arts of Washington, D.C., which Carter represented at the event. “He trains with precision, leads with humility, and competes with heart. His victories on the world stage reflect what’s possible when martial arts and leadership come together. He’s an inspiration to everyone in our school and far beyond,” said Master John Faett of Leesburg, Virginia.

In addition to his role as DHA R&D-MRDC’s chief of staff, Carter serves as the biochemistry and physiology consultant to the Army surgeon general. His previous assignments include White House social aide to the president, MRDC liaison officer, and medical modernization and research, development, and acquisition advisor to the executive deputy to the commanding general, Army Futures Command Headquarters in Austin, Texas.

Carter credits his achievement to his dedication to the shared ethos between martial arts and the armed forces — honor, perseverance, self-discipline, and leadership.

“The structure and values of military service complement the discipline of martial arts training,” Carter said. “I believe my accomplishments at the 2025 ATA World Championships demonstrate the best of two worlds: service to country and mastery of self.”",https://d1ldvf68ux039x.cloudfront.net/thumbs/photos/2507/9230460/1000w_q95.jpg,N,0.0,2025-08-01 13:56:12.445515

Fast Lab ran a website during the COVID-19 pandemic that claimed to offer free COVID tests, the attorney's office said.
Medical professionals also neither collected nor returned saliva samples to Fast Lab, and PCR testing was not performed.
Fast Lab would also allegedly submit insurance claims before the test kits were delivered to the beneficiaries.
Biricik's billing scheme led to over $500 million in claims and was paid over $50 million, the attorney's office said.","CONNECTICUT, USA — A Connecticut man was one of two people arrested Thursday morning for their involvement in a $500 million nationwide COVID-19 test billing fraud scheme.

Dr. Martin Perlin, 74, of Fairfield, Conn., and Cemhan “Jimmy” Biricik, 46, of Boca Raton, Fla., were charged with conspiracy to commit health care fraud and over 50 counts of health care fraud, according to the U.S. Attorney for the Eastern District of Michigan.

Perlin was a medical director for New York-based Fast Lab Technologies, LLC., and was a provider responsible for ordering the majority of tests, the attorney's office said.

Biricik served as the sole member and CEO of Fast Lab.

Fast Lab ran a website during the COVID-19 pandemic that claimed to offer free COVID tests, the attorney's office said.

The website asked people to enter their insurance information as they attempted to order the tests. The attorney's office said Fast Lab would then use that information to fraudulently bill Medicare, Medicaid, TRICARE and other private insurances for antigen — ""rapid"" — and PCR — ""laboratory"" — tests.

The billing included multiple dates for each beneficiary.

Fast Lab allegedly made false claims about the tests, including that medical professionals observed the antigen tests, that medical professionals collected the saliva samples and that PCR testing was performed on the samples.

Citing the indictment, the attorney's office said the vast majority of antigen tests were taken at home and not observed by medical professionals. Medical professionals also neither collected nor returned saliva samples to Fast Lab, and PCR testing was not performed.

Perlin ordered the tests despite not having treated any of the people who would receive them. Fast Lab would also allegedly submit insurance claims before the test kits were delivered to the beneficiaries.

Biricik's billing scheme led to over $500 million in claims and was paid over $50 million, the attorney's office said.

However, the resolution of the TRICARE payment suspension and the company's ability to execute its cost-cutting plan and leadership transition will be key factors in determining Zynex's performance.","Zynex Inc. is implementing a $40M cost-cutting plan and leadership transition as the company refocuses its pain management business model amidst challenges in the TRICARE market. The company's CEO, Thomas Sandgaard, announced improvements centered around reshaping the sales force and redirecting them to a slightly different approach. The move aims to improve the company's performance and competitiveness in the market.

Zynex Inc. (ZYXI), a medical technology company, has announced a significant cost-cutting plan and leadership transition aimed at refocusing its pain management business model amidst challenges in the TRICARE market. The company's CEO, Thomas Sandgaard, highlighted improvements centered around reshaping the sales force and redirecting them to a slightly different approach to enhance performance and competitiveness [2].

Sandgaard announced that Zynex is implementing approximately $40 million in annualized expense reductions and a push for positive cash flow by the end of the year. The company also aims to diversify its prescriber and payer base, improve inventory use, and maintain a performance-focused culture. These efforts are part of a broader strategy to return Zynex to a strong growth trajectory [2].

The company has also undergone a leadership transition. Sandgaard will transition to the position of Chairman of the Board, and Steven Dyson will take over as CEO. Dyson brings over 25 years of experience in the medical technology sector and is expected to help Zynex refocus its business strategy towards a more optimized payer mix. The CFO, Dan Moorhead, has also resigned [2].

Zynex's second-quarter results showed a quarterly loss of $0.32 per share, missing the Zacks Consensus Estimate of a loss of $0.20. The company's revenues for the quarter ended June 2025 were $22.29 million, down from $49.88 million a year ago. The company has not been able to beat consensus revenue estimates over the last four quarters [1].

The sustainability of Zynex's stock price will depend on the company's earnings outlook and future earnings expectations. The current consensus EPS estimate for the coming quarter is -$0.20 on $28.13 million in revenues. For the current fiscal year, the estimate is -$0.81 on $110.3 million in revenues [1].

Zynex shares have lost about 68.9% since the beginning of the year, compared to the S&P 500's gain of 8.2%. The company's Zacks Rank is currently #4 (Sell), indicating that the stock is expected to underperform the market in the near future [1].

The company's efforts to reduce costs, diversify revenue streams, and improve cash flow are crucial for its future success. However, the resolution of the TRICARE payment suspension and the company's ability to execute its cost-cutting plan and leadership transition will be key factors in determining Zynex's performance.

BY: ANDREW COLTON | Editor and Publisher | BOCA RATON, FL (BocaNewsNow.com) (Copyright © 2025 MetroDesk Media, LLC) — BocaNewsNow.com has confirmed that Cemhan Biricik, a homeowner in Boca Bridges, is the subject of the FBI raid conducted early Thursday morning in the gated West Boca Raton community. Biricik was taken into custody and is now facing more than 50 charges related to COVID-19 fraud stemming from an allegedly bogus COVID testing operation that he ran.

Agents conducted the raid at 9623 Macchiato Avenue which is the $4,725,000 home in Boca Bridges that Biricik owns with his wife. The United States Department of Justice immediately filed an order with the court in Palm Beach County asserting a claim on the property which does not appear to have a mortgage.

Here is the official statement issued to BocaNewsNow.com by the FBI Thursday afternoon:

>> Two individuals were charged for their involvement in a $500 million, nationwide scheme that involved billing Medicare, Medicaid, TRICARE, and other health insurance programs for COVID-19 testing services that were never rendered, United States Attorney Jerome F. Gorgon Jr. announced today.

Cemhan “Jimmy” Biricik (age 46) of Boca Raton Florida, and Dr. Martin Perlin (age 74) of Fairfield, Connecticut were charged with conspiracy to commit health care fraud and more than 50 substantive counts of health care fraud. Biricik was the sole member and Chief Executive Officer of Fast Lab Technologies, LLC (Fast Lab). Dr. Perlin was Fast Lab’s Medical Director and provider responsible for ordering the majority of the tests. Both defendants were arrested this morning.

According to the Indictment, during the Covid-19 pandemic, New York-based Fast Lab operated a website offering “free” covid tests. When individuals went to the website to order tests, they were asked to provide their insurance information. Fast Lab then used this insurance information to fraudulently bill Medicare, Medicaid, TRICARE and numerous private insurances for both antigen (“rapid”) and PCR (“laboratory) tests, across multiple dates for each beneficiary. Specifically, Fast Lab’s claims represented that (1) the antigen tests had been observed by medical professionals, (2) saliva samples were collected by medical professionals, and (3) PCR testing was performed on those samples. In reality, the vast majority of antigen tests—if taken at all—were taken at home and not observed by medical professionals; saliva samples were never collected nor returned to Fast Lab; and PCR testing was never performed. Dr. Perlin was the ordering physician for these tests, despite not having a treating relationship with the beneficiaries. Further, Fast Lab would regularly submit insurance claims before the test kits were even delivered to the beneficiaries. In total, Biricik billed or caused to be billed more than $500 million in claims and was paid more than $50 million.

Gorgon was joined in the announcement by Special Agent in Charge Mario Pinto, U.S. Department of Health and Human Services Office of Inspector General (HHS-OIG), Chicago Regional Office; Special Agent in Charge Cheyvoryea Gibson, Federal Bureau of Investigation, Detroit Division; Special Agent in Charge Derek M. Holt of the U.S. Office of Personnel Management Office of the Inspector General; Acting Assistant Secretary of Labor for the Employee Benefits Security Administration Janet Dhillon (DOL-EBSA); Detroit Division; Acting Special Agent in Charge Christopher Silvestro, Defense Criminal Investigative Service (DCIS); Special Agent in Charge Charles Miller, Detroit Field Office, Internal Revenue Service – Criminal Investigation (IRS-CI); Special Agent in Charge Megan Howell, Great Lakes Region, U.S. Department of Labor, Office of Inspector General (DOL-OIG); Acting Inspector in Charge Sean McStravick, U.S. Postal Inspection Service (USPIS); Owen Cypher, U.S. Marshal for the Eastern District of Michigan and Michigan Attorney General Dana Nessel, Medicaid Fraud Control Unit (MFCU).

The public is reminded that an Indictment is not evidence of guilt. The defendants are presumed innocent and entitled to a fair trial at which the government has the burden of proving guilt beyond a reasonable doubt.

This case is being investigated by Special Agents from HHS-OIG, FBI, OPM-OIG, DOL-EBSA, DCIS, MFCU, IRS-CI, DOL-OIG, USPIS, and the U.S. Marshal’s Service. It is being prosecuted by Assistant U.S. Attorneys Regina R. McCullough and Ryan A. Particka. Assistant United States Attorney Ryan T.

For example, just this Spring, we participated in two Joint Force, international, U.S.-led exercises in the Philippines and Lithuania.
Moreover, we can and do routinely support the urgent needs of the Joint Force, up to and including the medical team that supports the Executive Branch.
COL Roberts: This is indeed a challenging world – we see it every day and at every turn.
Second, we are developing stronger ties with end users across the Joint Force to focus on efforts that will yield the greatest return on investment in the shortest time possible.","U.S. Army Col. Owen L. Roberts assumed leadership of the newly established Operational Medical Systems Program Management Office in early 2025. As part of the Defense Health Agency, OPMED acts as the Department of Defense’s leading force in medical development and acquisition, working to enhance warfighter lethality and readiness. The project managers on his team develop and deliver next-generation, world-class medical capabilities that empower combatant commanders for Large-Scale Combat Operations, especially in austere environments. Their mission focuses on two key objectives: saving lives on the battlefield and quickly returning injured service members to duty.

As the DOD’s medical community prepares for the 2025 Military Health System Research Symposium next week in Kissimmee, Florida – MHSRS is the DOD’s premier scientific meeting focused on warfighter medical readiness, performance, expeditionary medicine, and return to duty – Roberts shared his insights into the dynamic capabilities OPMED brings to the table, how their mission is evolving, and what his team is doing to support the U.S. Joint Force.

Changes are rapidly occurring across the DoD. How is the OPMED team managing these changes while continuing its mission to support warfighters?

COL Roberts: We operate in a very dynamic environment, and we continue to evolve to better meet the needs of leadership within the Department of Defense and our partners in the Joint Force. That said, our focus and our mission haven't changed: we remain the DOD’s premier medical development and acquisition experts, laser-focused on supporting the medics, corpsmen, and medical officers in the Army, Navy, Air Force, and special forces. Whether we're managing a product, device, treatment, or project, each begins at a different point in the development process.

However, our ultimate aim remains constant: to provide our military end users with the vital tools they need to save lives during Large-Scale Combat Operations and return injured service members to duty.

These priorities are what we focus on, as individuals and as a team, because it is what the American people expect from military medical providers. We will continue to innovate, improve our processes, and refine our approach to deliver the best medical capabilities available to the Joint Force. In the end, it’s all about improving warfighter readiness and honing warfighter lethality for tomorrow’s wars.

What are some of the core focus areas for OPMED as we head toward 2026 and beyond?

COL Roberts: First, we are working to streamline and improve the processes that directly support the medics and medical officers at the front lines. For OPMED, that means making some tough choices to better apply our resources toward projects that address a current capability gap and are most beneficial to end users in a time- and resource-constrained environment.

Second, we continue to focus on warfighter readiness and lethality. Our project management portfolios – blood products, brain health, expeditionary medicine, rapid diagnostics, and force health protection, to name a few – are all tailored to meet the needs of medical providers at and near the front lines. Our goal is to develop, acquire, and field the tools that improve readiness at the operational level and increase lethality at the tactical level – as rapidly and cost-effectively as possible.

We are mindful that 2026 (and, for that matter, the years to come) is not a finish line, but a benchmark. The key to our success is to continuously develop the devices, treatments, and capabilities that will meet the needs of the DOD and the military medical community.

How is OPMED expanding its scope to meet the needs of that broader DOD medical community?

COL Roberts: That’s a great question, and the answer is twofold.

One, we have a much wider aperture now that we have realigned to the Defense Health Agency. Our stakeholders are no longer primarily within one service, as was the case when we existed as part of the Department of the Army. OPMED’s projects and portfolios must be necessarily broad to meet the needs of the individual services, but also tailored to meet the specific needs of medical providers at the front lines, regardless of the color of their uniforms. It is a new challenge, but one that we are particularly well-suited for, given the reach we have within the DOD.

Two, we are very proactive in our outreach, while remaining flexible and responsive to urgent needs. For example, just this Spring, we participated in two Joint Force, international, U.S.-led exercises in the Philippines and Lithuania. We met with and supported key stakeholders in the INDOPACOM and EUCOM combatant commands during Balikatan 25 and DEFENDER 25, respectively. These were premier events that both raised awareness of our mission and gave us a much better understanding of the challenges end users face in tactical, austere environments. Moreover, we can and do routinely support the urgent needs of the Joint Force, up to and including the medical team that supports the Executive Branch.

Why is it important to have a medical development organization like OPMED, especially given the DOD’s focus on Large-Scale Combat Operations in austere environments?

COL Roberts: I ask myself that question frequently, and the answer drives my mission mindset: OPMED is the avenue for generational advancement within the U.S. military medical community – and we cannot, and will not, fail in that mission.

The projects we manage for the DOD are designed for worldwide use tomorrow, and for at least a few generations to come. From beachheads in the Indo-Pacific to military treatment facilities in the United States, the capabilities we are developing now will someday be in the hands of medics who haven’t even been born yet in 2025.

We take that responsibility seriously, because we don’t know what the future holds – but we will work tirelessly to make sure our partners in the Joint Force are as prepared as possible for the next war, wherever and whenever it happens.

How do you and the OPMED team measure success?

COL Roberts: This comes down to our priorities: Driving innovation in the medical development space; rapidly developing medical solutions for service members; enabling warfighter readiness and increasing lethality; and managing proactive partnerships inside the DOD and with industry to deliver functional and fieldable technologies and treatments as quickly as possible.

We measure our success by meeting those objectives on a daily, monthly, and quarterly basis, because that is what our warfighters need and what the American people deserve: medical solutions that not only save lives but also enhance the DOD’s ability to fight and win anywhere in the world.

What are some of the challenges on the horizon, and how is OPMED working to mitigate them?

COL Roberts: This is indeed a challenging world – we see it every day and at every turn. The U.S. is center stage in addressing regional conflicts across several combatant command areas of responsibility in real time. The challenge that OPMED faces, as the DOD’s premier medical development organization, is to increase the speed of delivery while outpacing the technological innovations of our adversaries. We do not have the luxury of embarking on projects that take a decade – the threat environment is evolving far too rapidly for old paradigms.

We address these challenges every day in very deliberate ways. First, we are conducting an expedited and thorough review and assessment of the high-impact programs that meet the immediate needs of warfighters: blood replacement, oxygen delivery, and combat trauma treatment, to name a few. These lifesaving capabilities are the highest priority for frontline medics and medical organizations at Role 1 (field treatment) and Role 2 (forward support) levels of care.

Second, we are developing stronger ties with end users across the Joint Force to focus on efforts that will yield the greatest return on investment in the shortest time possible. Our project managers routinely meet and engage with the stakeholders who rely on our development expertise. They, in turn, provide invaluable feedback to help our teams refine their processes and quicken the pace of development. It’s all about reaching milestones, securing FDA approvals, and transitioning new products for fielding to make the biggest impact.

Third, we remain acutely aware of conflicts happening across the globe. The DOD has worldwide reach and influence, and at literally any moment, American soldiers, sailors, airmen, and Marines can be called to action, anywhere around the world. At OPMED, our core mission is to develop medical solutions that are functional and fieldable today, in support of our warfighters. And the team we have in place is ready to deliver.",https://dha.mil/-/media/Project/Images/OPMED/OPMED_Seal.jpg,N,0.0,2025-08-01 01:24:08.583144

Performance Overview and Challenges

Zynex Inc reported net revenue of $22.3 million for Q2 2025, significantly below the analyst estimate of $27.38 million. This represents a sharp decline from $49.9 million in the same quarter of the previous year. The revenue shortfall was attributed to the Tricare payment suspension, changes in shipment and billing procedures, and restructuring efforts that included reductions in the sales force.

The company reported a net loss of $20.0 million, or $0.66 per share, which was below the estimated earnings per share of -$0.20. This loss includes a non-cash adjustment of $10.3 million related to deferred tax assets. In contrast, the company had reported a net income of $1.2 million, or $0.04 per share, in Q2 2024.

Financial Achievements and Industry Context

Despite the challenges, Zynex Inc achieved a gross profit of $15.2 million, representing 68% of revenue, although this was a decrease from $39.9 million or 80% of revenue in the previous year. The company has implemented efficiency improvements aimed at achieving annualized savings of approximately $40 million, which are expected to take full effect in the latter half of the year.

Key Financial Metrics

During the second quarter, Zynex's net revenue was $22.3 million, a decrease from $49.9 million in the prior year quarter.

Sales and marketing expenses decreased by 45% to $12.8 million, while general and administrative expenses were $12.7 million, down from $14.5 million in the prior year period [1].

The company's net loss for the quarter totaled $20.0 million, or $0.66 per basic and diluted share, including a non-cash adjustment of $10.3 million or $0.34 per share related to placing an allowance on deferred tax assets. Adjusted EBITDA loss for the quarter was $8.9 million, compared to Adjusted EBITDA of $3.5 million in the prior year quarter. Cash collections during the quarter were $26.1 million, and cash flow from operations was ($6.2) million [1].

Zynex expects to return to profitability in 2025, driven by its strong pipeline of future products and partnerships. The company aims to leverage digital data analysis and monitoring products to drive growth and revenue increase. Additionally, Zynex plans to implement several efficiency improvements to internal operations, reallocating staff to more profitable business lines, reducing the cost of goods sold, and updating its organizational structure [1].

FAIRFIELD, CT — Federal authorities have charged a 74-year-old Fairfield man, and a Florida man, in connection with an alleged scheme to fraudulently bill more than $500 million to Medicare, Medicaid, TRICARE, and private insurers for COVID-19 testing services that were never provided, prosecutors announced Thursday.

Fairfield resident Dr. Martin Perlin, and Cemhan ""Jimmy"" Biricik, 46, of Boca Raton, FL were charged with conspiracy to commit health care fraud and more than 50 counts of health care fraud, according to U.S. Attorney Jerome F. Gorgon Jr. in the Eastern District of Michigan.

Biricik, the CEO and sole member of New York-based Fast Lab Technologies, LLC, and Perlin, the company’s medical director, were arrested Thursday morning.

According to the indictment, during the COVID-19 pandemic, Fast Lab promoted free testing through its website, collecting insurance information from individuals who requested test kits. Prosecutors allege that the company then used that information to submit false claims for both antigen and PCR tests, including multiple claims for the same individuals.

The indictment states that Fast Lab falsely represented that tests were supervised by medical professionals, that saliva samples were collected and returned for analysis, and that lab testing was conducted. In most cases, prosecutors allege, tests were taken at home without supervision, saliva samples were never submitted, and no laboratory analysis occurred.

Perlin is accused of authorizing the tests despite having no treating relationship with the individuals. Authorities also allege that Fast Lab often submitted claims before the test kits were shipped.

Biricik is accused of billing or directing the billing of more than $500 million and receiving over $50 million in payments.

The investigation involves multiple federal agencies, including the Department of Health and Human Services Office of Inspector General, the FBI, the Department of Labor, the IRS, the Defense Criminal Investigative Service, and the U.S. Postal Inspection Service, among others.

Gorgon emphasized that both men are presumed innocent unless proven guilty. The case is being prosecuted by Assistant U.S. Attorneys Regina R. McCullough and Ryan A. Particka. Assistance was also provided by the U.S. Attorney’s Office for the Southern District of New York.",https://patch.com/img/cdn20/users/21821499/20250731/045957/styles/patch_image/public/202108-pcs-gavel-court-giuliani___31165732389.jpg,N,0.0,2025-07-31 17:56:07.747911

According to the settlement agreement and the complaint in partial intervention, Exposito and her company altered patients’ medical diagnoses to obtain prior authorizations on behalf of pharmacies, including PerforMix Specialty Pharmacy, a compounding pharmacy located in Amherst. This resulted in the submission of false claims to Medicare and TRICARE.

“Submitting false claims to federal health care programs like Medicare and TRICARE undermines the integrity of our health care system and diverts critical resources away from patients who need them,” said U.S. Attorney Jay McCormack. “Accountability in cases like this helps restore trust in our health care system and ensures taxpayer dollars are protected.”

“The submission of falsified prior authorization requests undermines an important safeguard against unnecessary Medicare costs,” said Special Agent in Charge Roberto Coviello of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, Office of Inspector General (HHS-OIG). “This settlement highlights HHS-OIG’s ongoing commitment to combatting fraud in the taxpayer-funded Medicare program, and we will continue to thoroughly pursue allegations of False Claims Act violations.”

The False Claims Act permits whistleblowers to file civil lawsuits alleging that false claims have been submitted to the United States. This FCA settlement resolves allegations against Georgina Exposito’s company originally brought in a lawsuit filed by a whistleblower. As part of the settlement the whistleblower will receive a portion of the settlement amount.

The claims resolved by the settlement are allegations only, and there has been no determination of liability. The United States’ case against the other defendants named in the complaint in partial intervention continues.

This case was investigated by the Office of Inspector General of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, the Office of Inspector General of the Department of Defense, and the Federal Bureau of Investigation. The case is being handled by Assistant U.S. Attorney Raphael Katz.

""During the quarter we continued our efforts to refocus our sales force and operations to reflect the current landscape of insurance coverage and have made significant strides towards our goal of returning to positive cash-flow. We have implemented several efficiency improvements to internal operations, reallocating staff to more profitable business lines, reducing our cost of goods sold, and updating our organizational structure while driving the sales force to become more efficient and productive. These improvements will result in annualized savings of approximately $40 million, most of which will take full effect in the third and fourth quarters of this year.""

""We strongly believe in our commitment to help patients with the best products for pain relief without the side effects that are associated with opioids. We are confident that our efforts to reduce costs and redirecting our sales force will be pivotal to improved cash flow and create a foundation for continuing to grow into the huge demand for our products.""

Second Quarter 2025 Financial Results

Net revenue was $22.3 million for the three months ended June 30, 2025, compared to $49.9 million in the prior year quarter. Net revenue was negatively affected by the Tricare payment suspension, continued changes to our shipment and billing procedures to improve patient experience, and the impact of restructuring and reductions in our sales force required for cost savings.

Gross profit in the quarter ended June 30, 2025, was $15.2 million, or 68% of revenue, as compared to $39.9 million or 80% of revenue, in the second quarter of 2024. Gross profit was lower due to lower revenue and continuing to support new and existing Tricare patients which yields cost of goods sold with no related revenue.

Sales and marketing expense for the three months ended June 30, 2025, decreased 45% to $12.8 million from $23.2 million for the same period in 2024, primarily due to decreased headcount in the sales force.

General and administrative expenses for the three months ended June 30, 2025, were $12.7 million, versus $14.5 million in the prior year period.

Net loss for the three months ended June 30, 2025, totaled ($20.0) million, or ($0.66) per basic and diluted share, including a non-cash adjustment of $10.3 million or ($0.34) per share related to placing an allowance on our deferred tax assets. For the quarter ended June 30, 2024, net income was $1.2 million, or $0.04 per basic and diluted share.

Adjusted EBITDA loss for the three months ended June 30, 2025, was ($8.9) million, as compared to Adjusted EBITDA of $3.5 million in the quarter ended June 30, 2024.

Cash collections were $26.1 million during the quarter and $56.8 million year-to-date. Cash flow from operations for the three and six months ended June 30, 2025, was ($6.2) million and ($16.7) million, respectively. The sequential quarterly reduction in the deficit of cash from operations was due to the impact of expense reductions. As of June 30, 2025, the Company had cash and cash equivalents of $17.5 million.

Third Quarter 2025 Guidance

With the retirement of our current Chief Executive Officer and the announced departure of our Chief Financial Officer, the Company is temporarily suspending revenue and profitability guidance. Steven Dyson, the incoming Chief Executive Officer, will lead a review of the Company's forecasting procedures and will provide an update to investors on the potential resumption of guidance in the coming quarters.

Cash flow from operations for the three and six months ended June 30, 2025, was ($6.2) million and ($16.7) million, respectively. The sequential quarterly reduction in the deficit of cash from operations was due to the impact of expense reductions.

Non-GAAP Financial Measures

Zynex reports its financial results in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S. (GAAP). In addition, the Company is providing in this news release financial information in the form of Adjusted EBITDA (earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, amortization, other income/expense, stock compensation, restructuring, receivables adjustment and non-cash lease charges). Management believes these non-GAAP financial measures are useful to investors and lenders in evaluating the overall financial health of the Company in that they allow for greater transparency of additional financial data routinely used by management to evaluate performance. Adjusted EBITDA can be useful for investors or lenders as an indicator of available earnings. Non-GAAP financial measures should not be considered in isolation from, or as an alternative to, the financial information prepared in accordance with GAAP.

According to the Indictment, during the Covid-19 pandemic, New York-based Fast Lab operated a website offering “free” covid tests.

Further, Fast Lab would regularly submit insurance claims before the test kits were even delivered to the beneficiaries.","DETROIT – Two individuals were charged for their involvement in a $500 million, nationwide scheme that involved billing Medicare, Medicaid, TRICARE, and other health insurance programs for COVID-19 testing services that were never rendered, United States Attorney Jerome F. Gorgon Jr. announced today.

Cemhan “Jimmy” Biricik (age 46) of Boca Raton Florida, and Dr. Martin Perlin (age 74) of Fairfield, Connecticut were charged with conspiracy to commit health care fraud and more than 50 substantive counts of health care fraud. Biricik was the sole member and Chief Executive Officer of Fast Lab Technologies, LLC (Fast Lab). Dr. Perlin was Fast Lab’s Medical Director and provider responsible for ordering the majority of the tests. Both defendants were arrested this morning.

According to the Indictment, during the Covid-19 pandemic, New York-based Fast Lab operated a website offering “free” covid tests. When individuals went to the website to order tests, they were asked to provide their insurance information. Fast Lab then used this insurance information to fraudulently bill Medicare, Medicaid, TRICARE and numerous private insurances for both antigen (“rapid”) and PCR (“laboratory) tests, across multiple dates for each beneficiary. Specifically, Fast Lab’s claims represented that (1) the antigen tests had been observed by medical professionals, (2) saliva samples were collected by medical professionals, and (3) PCR testing was performed on those samples. In reality, the vast majority of antigen tests—if taken at all—were taken at home and not observed by medical professionals; saliva samples were never collected nor returned to Fast Lab; and PCR testing was never performed. Dr. Perlin was the ordering physician for these tests, despite not having a treating relationship with the beneficiaries. Further, Fast Lab would regularly submit insurance claims before the test kits were even delivered to the beneficiaries. In total, Biricik billed or caused to be billed more than $500 million in claims and was paid more than $50 million.

Gorgon was joined in the announcement by Special Agent in Charge Mario Pinto, U.S. Department of Health and Human Services Office of Inspector General (HHS-OIG), Chicago Regional Office; Special Agent in Charge Cheyvoryea Gibson, Federal Bureau of Investigation, Detroit Division; Special Agent in Charge Derek M. Holt of the U.S. Office of Personnel Management Office of the Inspector General; Acting Assistant Secretary of Labor for the Employee Benefits Security Administration Janet Dhillon (DOL-EBSA); Detroit Division; Acting Special Agent in Charge Christopher Silvestro, Defense Criminal Investigative Service (DCIS); Special Agent in Charge Karen Wingerd, Detroit Field Office, Internal Revenue Service - Criminal Investigation (IRS-CI); Special Agent in Charge Megan Howell, Great Lakes Region, U.S. Department of Labor, Office of Inspector General (DOL-OIG); Acting Inspector in Charge Sean McStravick, U.S. Postal Inspection Service (USPIS); Owen Cypher, U.S. Marshal for the Eastern District of Michigan and Michigan Attorney General Dana Nessel, Medicaid Fraud Control Unit (MFCU).

The public is reminded that an Indictment is not evidence of guilt. The defendants are presumed innocent and entitled to a fair trial at which the government has the burden of proving guilt beyond a reasonable doubt.

This case is being investigated by Special Agents from HHS-OIG, FBI, OPM-OIG, DOL-EBSA, DCIS, MFCU, IRS-CI, DOL-OIG, USPIS, and the U.S. Marshal’s Service.

“National Guard and Reserve members have different TRICARE coverage options when they transition between active and inactive status,” said Brian Smith, senior health system specialist, TRICARE Health Plan, at the Defense Health Agency. “TRICARE encourages you to review your health coverage options to ensure you maintain continuous health coverage. Do this prior to coming on active duty orders for more than 30 days and deactivating.”

What are my TRICARE options when I activate?

You get the same health care benefits as active duty service members when you’re activated for more than 30 days on qualifying orders. Your service updates your TRICARE eligibility in the Defense Enrollment Eligibility Reporting System. Your service does this each time your duty status changes.

Did you receive delayed effective-date, active duty orders for more than 30 days in support of a contingency operation or under 12304b? Then you get early TRICARE eligibility up to 180 days from the date your active duty begins. Do you want more information? Visit TRICARE Pre-Activation Benefits.

Here are things to consider:

• Your TRICARE health plan. You’ll be automatically enrolled in TRICARE Prime as an active duty service member. You’ll have an unassigned primary care manager. This means you can see any TRICARE-authorized provider. You’ll follow your command’s guidance on any additional enrollment requirements when you arrive to your final duty station. The following TRICARE Prime health plans may be an option:

o TRICARE Prime

o TRICARE Prime Remote

o TRICARE Prime Overseas

o TRICARE Prime Remote Overseas

• Your family gets coverage, too. Eligible family members may enroll in a TRICARE health plan. This depends on where they live at the time of your activation. They must act and enroll in one of these health plans within 90 days of your activation.

o TRICARE Prime

o TRICARE Prime Remote

o TRICARE Prime Overseas

o TRICARE Prime Remote Overseas

o TRICARE Select

o TRICARE Select Overseas

o US Family Health Plan

o TRICARE Young Adult

• Dental coverage changes. Did you have TRICARE Dental Program coverage prior to activation? You’ll be automatically enrolled in the Active Duty Dental Program. This is described in the TRICARE Active Duty Dental Program Brochure. Your enrolled family members keep their TDP coverage with lower premiums. Family members who aren’t enrolled can join anytime.

Are you wondering how to get care while activated for more than 30 days? Do you have TRICARE Prime?

• You can get routine, urgent, and emergency care from a military hospital or clinic or a civilian TRICARE-authorized provider.

• Referrals and pre-authorizations are required for specialty care.

Do your family members have TRICARE Select coverage?

• They can get care from any TRICARE-authorized provider.

• They can get care at a military hospital or clinic if space is available.

• They don’t need referrals in most situations. They may need pre-authorizations for some health care services.

Do you live and work more than 50 miles from a military hospital or clinic? Your family members may enroll in TRICARE Prime Remote. You can check to see if you’re in a remote location—use the TRICARE Plan Finder. Your family members get most of their care from a TRICARE-authorized provider with TRICARE Prime Remote.

What about line of duty care?

Line of duty care is limited to ailments incurred or aggravated during a period of qualified duty 30 days or less. This includes injuries sustained while traveling to and from and staying overnight at a duty station. Your unit is responsible for initiating an LOD determination request.

LOD isn’t a government lifetime health plan. It’s a special eligibility status to treat a specific condition for up to one year. The process for getting LOD care depends on where you’re located. Check out Line of Duty Care for Service Members to learn more.

How about when I deactivate?

Once your active duty period ends, your TRICARE coverage options depend on the type of orders you were under.

Were your active duty orders more than 30 days in support of a contingency operation or under 12304b? If so, you’d be eligible for Transitional Assistance Management Program coverage for 180 days. You and your eligible family members are covered as active duty family members. Your TRICARE health plan options depend on where you live with TAMP coverage. TRICARE Prime Remote isn’t available during TAMP. You must act and submit your new enrollment request within 90 days from your last date on active duty. If you fail to do so, you’ll only be eligible for coverage at a military hospital or clinic.

After TAMP coverage ends, or if you weren’t eligible for TAMP and your active duty period ends, you may have options. You may buy TRICARE Reserve Select coverage if you qualify. Or you may be eligible for Continued Health Care Benefit Program coverage. You may also seek health care insurance through your state’s Health Insurance Marketplace.

You maintain TRICARE pharmacy benefits during TAMP or other TRICARE health plan options.

Is there dental coverage after deactivation?

• Active duty dental benefits continue during TAMP.

• Your TDP coverage and premiums return to regular rates when TAMP or other TRICARE coverage ends.

• Your family members’ TDP coverage continues without interruption.

Do I get retirement coverage?

You may keep TRICARE coverage after retirement. This is if you complete 20 qualifying years of service.

Are you retiring from the National Guard or Reserve? Are you under age 60? You may buy TRICARE Retired Reserve if you qualify. TRICARE Retired Reserve is a premium-based health plan. For more information, visit TRICARE Retired Reserve.

Have you turned age 60 and are drawing retirement pay? You may enroll in TRICARE Prime or TRICARE Select.

Are you under age 60 and drawing retirement pay due to active duty segments? You aren’t eligible to enroll in TRICARE Prime. You may buy or continue coverage under TRICARE Retired Reserve.

Want to make sure your family keeps their health coverage during these transitions? Review all your TRICARE options. You can contact your regional contractor with any questions. You can also visit the TRICARE website to learn more.",https://d1ldvf68ux039x.cloudfront.net/thumbs/photos/2507/9230217/1000w_q95.jpg,N,0.0,2025-07-31 15:56:14.079622

The Armed Forces Wellness Center headquarters team, which is part of Defense Health Agency-Public Health located in Aberdeen, Maryland, achieved a major milestone with the American Medical Association’s approval of a new Current Procedural Terminology code for air displacement plethysmography, which is a body composition analysis method used across the DHA health promotion enterprise.

This new code, which goes into effect in January 2026, enables standardized reporting of whole-body composition assessments, offering AFWCs a higher level of precision in evaluating services provided to military hospital or clinic beneficiaries.

“The addition of this code allows for greater granularity and more refined measurement of readiness-focused health promotion activities across the Military Health System,” said Michael Jarka, AFWC health promotion program manager.

The approval will increase transparency between the primary care teams and health promotion/AFWC teams, said Joanna Ward-Brown, AFWC operations project officer. Previously this service was being provided by either the AFWC or medical clinic but not captured in the electronic medical record as there was no code for body composition assessment via air displacement technology.

“This means that AFWCs and other military hospitals and clinics around the world can accurately capture body composition assessments using Bod Pod air displacement technology,” said Ward-Brown. “Accurately depicting services offered through the military hospital or clinic in the electronic medical record is critical and is a requirement for the Joint Commission, which certifies healthcare organizations across the U.S.”

For the first time, DHA can clinically track this capability through coded encounters, enhancing visibility of preventive services and performance optimization efforts, said Jarka.

“Previously, these data were captured inconsistently or excluded from clinical metrics entirely,” he said.

The new code allows AFWCs to capture the whole picture of the individual; specifically, it allows the entire care team to ensure service members are maintaining a healthy body composition and preventing diseases associated with obesity. The code increases efficiencies and ensures the warfighter’s health is being addressed holistically, said Ward-Brown.

To get approval, Ward-Brown submitted an application request to the AMA CPT Editorial Panel, which then reviewed it at their May 2025 meeting in New York. The panel accepted only 36 of the 80 applications reviewed during the meeting.

According to the AMA, the CPT Editorial Panel, a body appointed by the AMA board of trustees, is responsible for maintaining and updating the CPT code set, which is used to report medical services and procedures. The panel ensures the CPT codes reflect the latest medical care available. The process involves several steps, including submitting applications, review by AMA staff and CPT advisors, and final decision-making by the panel.

“It’s a very rigorous process—about 800 doctors attend that meeting,” said Ward-Brown. “The panel advisors become the ‘shepherds’ of my application and represent me before the panel at the AMA CPT editorial panel meeting. I was also given the opportunity to present my case and answer questions.”

After all questions/concerns have been addressed, the panel then votes, and results are posted on the AMA website a few weeks following the meeting, said Ward-Brown. She subsequently received the panel’s approval letter.

“One thing this accomplishment shows is that DHA assets have good partnerships with outside agencies,” said Ward-Brown.

The AFWC team plans to distribute the code across the enterprise in January 2026 as part of their implementation plan.

Referrals issued after June 9 must be accessed through the TriWest Patient Portal.","FORT POLK, La. —Bayne-Jones Army Community Hospital is encouraging beneficiaries to take greater ownership of their healthcare with a new digital process for managing off-post specialty referrals. As of June 9, all referrals are now processed through the TriWest Patient Portal, giving patients faster access to authorizations and the freedom to select their own provider.

Sabrina Cobb, BJACH’s chief of managed care, said the change is part of a broader shift to expand options, shorten wait times and improve patient outcomes.

“Patients now have the flexibility to choose a network provider that works best for them based on availability and travel distance,” Cobb said. “If that provider is more than 100 miles away, they’ll need to follow the TRICARE Prime Travel Reimbursement guidelines, which help cover reasonable travel costs when specialty care isn’t available closer to home.”

The new system eliminates the traditional wait for referral letters to arrive by mail. Patients are now encouraged to log into the TriWest portal to review their referral, choose a provider and schedule their appointment directly.

Greater choice, greater responsibility

The TriWest Patient Portal puts care in patients’ hands. Once logged in, patients can view and download approved referrals, see assigned providers and contact them directly, select a different network provider if desired, and begin the appointment process immediately.

“Patients no longer need to wait for a phone call or letter,” Cobb said. “They can take immediate action by logging in, reviewing the referral and calling to schedule their initial visit.”

The portal also includes provider contact information, office locations and a growing directory of participating specialists. TriWest is actively expanding its network to better meet patient needs.

Encouraging proactive care

This change, now in effect across the entire TRICARE West Region, reflects a growing emphasis on patient-centered care and personal responsibility in navigating the healthcare system.

“We encourage our patients to be involved in their healthcare, including treatment plans, setting goals with their provider, scheduling follow-ups and using available tools to improve outcomes,” Cobb said.

Patients who are proactive about their referrals often experience shorter wait times and better continuity of care.

Support when you need it

While the process is now patient-driven, BJACH’s managed care team remains available to support beneficiaries who have questions or concerns.

“We’re available Monday through Friday, 8 a.m. to 4:30 p.m.,” Cobb said. “We can help patients understand the referral process and direct them to the right resources.”

By Jean Graves

Bayne-Jones Army Community Hospital is encouraging beneficiaries to take greater ownership of their healthcare with a new digital process for managing off-post specialty referrals. As of June 9, all referrals are now processed through the TriWest Patient Portal, giving patients faster access to authorizations and the freedom to select their own provider.

Sabrina Cobb, BJACH’s chief of managed care, said the change is part of a broader shift to expand options, shorten wait times and improve patient outcomes.

“Patients now have the flexibility to choose a network provider that works best for them based on availability and travel distance,” Cobb said. “If that provider is more than 100 miles away, they’ll need to follow the TRICARE Prime Travel Reimbursement guidelines, which help cover reasonable travel costs when specialty care isn’t available closer to home.”

The new system eliminates the traditional wait for referral letters to arrive by mail. Patients are now encouraged to log into the TriWest portal to review their referral, choose a provider and schedule their appointment directly.

Greater choice, greater responsibility

The TriWest Patient Portal puts care in patients’ hands. Once logged in, patients can view and download approved referrals, see assigned providers and contact them directly, select a different network provider if desired, and begin the appointment process immediately.

“Patients no longer need to wait for a phone call or letter,” Cobb said. “They can take immediate action by logging in, reviewing the referral and calling to schedule their initial visit.”

The portal also includes provider contact information, office locations and a growing directory of participating specialists. TriWest is actively expanding its network to better meet patient needs.

Encouraging proactive care

This change, now in effect across the entire TRICARE West Region, reflects a growing emphasis on patient-centered care and personal responsibility in navigating the healthcare system.

“We encourage our patients to be involved in their healthcare, including treatment plans, setting goals with their provider, scheduling follow-ups and using available tools to improve outcomes,” Cobb said.

Patients who are proactive about their referrals often experience shorter wait times and better continuity of care.

Support when you need it

While the process is now patient-driven, BJACH’s managed care team remains available to support beneficiaries who have questions or concerns.

“We’re available Monday through Friday, 8 a.m. to 4:30 p.m.,” Cobb said. “We can help patients understand the referral process and direct them to the right resources.”

BJACH’s Beneficiary Counseling and Assistance Coordinator (BCAC) is also available to assist with eligibility, enrollment, claims and billing questions related to TRICARE.

In addition to support from the hospital, the TriWest Patient Portal includes a range of educational tools to help patients confidently navigate the system. Resources are available for selecting providers, making payments, booking appointments and understanding referral details.

We will continue to innovate, improve our processes, and refine our approach to deliver the best medical capabilities available to the Joint Force.
For example, just this Spring, we participated in two Joint Force, international, U.S.-led exercises in the Philippines and Lithuania.
Moreover, we can and do routinely support the urgent needs of the Joint Force, up to and including the medical team that supports the Executive Branch.
COL Roberts: This is indeed a challenging world – we see it every day and at every turn.","U.S. Army Col. Owen L. Roberts assumed leadership of the newly established Operational Medical Systems Program Management Office in early 2025. As part of the Defense Health Agency, OPMED acts as the Department of Defense’s leading force in medical development and acquisition, working to enhance Warfighter lethality and readiness. The project managers on his team develop and deliver next-generation, world-class medical capabilities that empower combatant commanders for Large-Scale Combat Operations, especially in austere environments. Their mission focuses on two key objectives: saving lives on the battlefield and quickly returning injured service members to duty.

As the DoD’s medical community prepares for the 2025 Military Health System Research Symposium next week in Kissimmee, Florida – MHSRS is the DoD’s premier scientific meeting focused on Warfighter medical readiness, performance, expeditionary medicine, and return to duty – Roberts shared his insights into the dynamic capabilities OPMED brings to the table, how their mission is evolving, and what his team is doing to support the U.S. Joint Force.

Changes are rapidly occurring across the DoD. How is the OPMED team managing these changes while continuing its mission to support Warfighters?

COL Roberts: We operate in a very dynamic environment, and we continue to evolve to better meet the needs of leadership within the Department of Defense and our partners in the Joint Force. That said, our focus and our mission haven't changed: we remain the DoD’s premier medical development and acquisition experts, laser-focused on supporting the medics, corpsmen, and medical officers in the Army, Navy, Air Force, and special forces.

Whether we're managing a product, device, treatment, or project, each begins at a different point in the development process.

However, our ultimate aim remains constant: to provide our military end users with the vital tools they need to save lives during Large-Scale Combat Operations and return injured service members to duty.

These priorities are what we focus on, as individuals and as a team, because it is what the American people expect from military medical providers. We will continue to innovate, improve our processes, and refine our approach to deliver the best medical capabilities available to the Joint Force. In the end, it’s all about improving Warfighter readiness and honing Warfighter lethality for tomorrow’s wars.

What are some of the core focus areas for OPMED as we head toward 2026 and beyond?

COL Roberts: First, we are working to streamline and improve the processes that directly support the medics and medical officers at the front lines. For OPMED, that means making some tough choices to better apply our resources toward projects that address a current capability gap and are most beneficial to end users in a time- and resource-constrained environment.

Second, we continue to focus on Warfighter readiness and lethality. Our project management portfolios – blood products, brain health, expeditionary medicine, rapid diagnostics, and force health protection, to name a few – are all tailored to meet the needs of medical providers at and near the front lines. Our goal is to develop, acquire, and field the tools that improve readiness at the operational level and increase lethality at the tactical level – as rapidly and cost-effectively as possible.

We are mindful that 2026 (and, for that matter, the years to come) is not a finish line, but a benchmark. The key to our success is to continuously develop the devices, treatments, and capabilities that will meet the needs of the DoD and the military medical community.

How is OPMED expanding its scope to meet the needs of that broader DoD medical community?

COL Roberts: That’s a great question, and the answer is twofold.

One, we have a much wider aperture now that we have realigned to the Defense Health Agency. Our stakeholders are no longer primarily within one service, as was the case when we existed as part of the Department of the Army. OPMED’s projects and portfolios must be necessarily broad to meet the needs of the individual services, but also tailored to meet the specific needs of medical providers at the front lines, regardless of the color of their uniforms. It is a new challenge, but one that we are particularly well-suited for, given the reach we have within the DoD.

Two, we are very proactive in our outreach, while remaining flexible and responsive to urgent needs. For example, just this Spring, we participated in two Joint Force, international, U.S.-led exercises in the Philippines and Lithuania. We met with and supported key stakeholders in the INDOPACOM and EUCOM combatant commands during Balikatan 25 and DEFENDER 25, respectively. These were premier events that both raised awareness of our mission and gave us a much better understanding of the challenges end users face in tactical, austere environments. Moreover, we can and do routinely support the urgent needs of the Joint Force, up to and including the medical team that supports the Executive Branch.

Why is it important to have a medical development organization like OPMED, especially given the DoD’s focus on Large-Scale Combat Operations in austere environments?

COL Roberts: I ask myself that question frequently, and the answer drives my mission mindset: OPMED is the avenue for generational advancement within the U.S. military medical community – and we cannot, and will not, fail in that mission.

The projects we manage for the DoD are designed for worldwide use tomorrow, and for at least a few generations to come. From beachheads in the Indo-Pacific to military treatment facilities in the United States, the capabilities we are developing now will someday be in the hands of medics who haven’t even been born yet in 2025.

We take that responsibility seriously, because we don’t know what the future holds – but we will work tirelessly to make sure our partners in the Joint Force are as prepared as possible for the next war, wherever and whenever it happens.

How do you and the OPMED team measure success?

COL Roberts: This comes down to our priorities: Driving innovation in the medical development space; rapidly developing medical solutions for service members; enabling Warfighter readiness and increasing lethality; and managing proactive partnerships inside the DoD and with industry to deliver functional and fieldable technologies and treatments as quickly as possible.

We measure our success by meeting those objectives on a daily, monthly, and quarterly basis, because that is what our Warfighters need and what the American people deserve: medical solutions that not only save lives but also enhance the DoD’s ability to fight and win anywhere in the world.

What are some of the challenges on the horizon, and how is OPMED working to mitigate them?

COL Roberts: This is indeed a challenging world – we see it every day and at every turn. The U.S. is center stage in addressing regional conflicts across several combatant command areas of responsibility in real time. The challenge that OPMED faces, as the DoD’s premier medical development organization, is to increase the speed of delivery while outpacing the technological innovations of our adversaries. We do not have the luxury of embarking on projects that take a decade – the threat environment is evolving far too rapidly for old paradigms.

We address these challenges every day in very deliberate ways. First, we are conducting an expedited and thorough review and assessment of the high-impact programs that meet the immediate needs of Warfighters: blood replacement, oxygen delivery, and combat trauma treatment, to name a few. These lifesaving capabilities are the highest priority for frontline medics and medical organizations at Role 1 (field treatment) and Role 2 (forward support) levels of care.

Second, we are developing stronger ties with end users across the Joint Force to focus on efforts that will yield the greatest return on investment in the shortest time possible. Our project managers routinely meet and engage with the stakeholders who rely on our development expertise. They, in turn, provide invaluable feedback to help our teams refine their processes and quicken the pace of development. It’s all about reaching milestones, securing FDA approvals, and transitioning new products for fielding to make the biggest impact.

Third, we remain acutely aware of conflicts happening across the globe. The DoD has worldwide reach and influence, and at literally any moment, American Soldiers, Sailors, Airmen, and Marines can be called to action, anywhere around the world. At OPMED, our core mission is to develop medical solutions that are functional and fieldable today, in support of our Warfighters. And the team we have in place is ready to deliver.",https://cdn.dvidshub.net/images/dvids_logo.svg,N,0.0,2025-07-31 11:56:13.528807

Is your student hitting the books at college this fall? For many eligible young adult military dependents, US Family Health Plan coverage can continue while they’re away at school. Typically, military dependents are eligible for TRICARE® benefits until their 21st birthday. If your dependent is enrolled full-time in an accredited college, coverage can extend up to their 23rd birthday or graduation, whichever comes first.

How to extend coverage past age 21

Request proof of full-time enrollment from the college registrar’s office, showing your dependent is working toward an associate degree or higher. Submit this documentation to DEERS.

Update your dependent’s DEERS information before their 21st birthday to avoid automatic disenrollment. Find instructions on updating DEERS information here.

After updating DEERS, call Member Services at 1-888-674-8734 (TTY: 711) to confirm the extension of coverage.

Getting care while away at school

Your dependent can still access care while away at college, even if outside of our network.

Urgent or emergency care: Covered anywhere, anytime. If your dependent received urgent or emergency care while out of the area, coverage applies. Be sure to notify Member Services afterward.

Point of service (POS) option: For routine or specialty care outside the network, coverage is still available under the POS option with higher out-of-pocket costs. See martinspoint.org/pos for more information about the POS benefit and your cost shares.

Transferring TRICARE coverage: If your dependent is living outside the service area long term, it may be helpful to transfer (“port”) their coverage to another TRICARE contractor. Call Member Services to review options.

Not a full-time student? There’s still coverage

If your dependent is between the ages of 21 and 26 and not enrolled full time in college, they may qualify for the TRICARE Young Adult (TYA) program. TYA is a premium-based plan available through Martin’s Point US Family Health Plan. TYA offers the same medical and pharmacy benefits as the TRICARE Prime plan you’re used to; however, your dependent becomes their own sponsor and pays a monthly premium.

To qualify for TYA

Be unmarried and under age 26

Be registered in DEERS and eligible for TRICARE benefits

Not be eligible for other employer-sponsored or military health coverage

If you’re considering TYA, call Member Services at 1-888-674-8734 to learn more about premiums, the application process, and what to expect.

The City of Lacey's Commission on Equity meeting on July 28, 2025, highlighted significant challenges faced by veterans and their families in navigating post-military life. Key discussions focused on the complexities of systems like VA and TRICARE, which many veterans find difficult to understand, leading to unmet behavioral health needs and basic necessities such as housing, jobs, and food.

Participants noted that the transition from military to civilian life can be particularly challenging, especially for those discharged before the implementation of the Transition Assistance Program (TAP) in 2018. This program was designed to prepare service members for civilian life, but its effectiveness varies widely among individuals. Some veterans reported that the program did not meet their needs, particularly for those in higher ranks who felt the resources were geared toward lower enlisted personnel.

The meeting also addressed the unique struggles faced by spouses and immigrant family members of active-duty military personnel. With service members often away for extended periods, spouses may struggle to access necessary resources, compounding their challenges, especially for those new to the country.

A notable point raised was the importance of integrating civilian experiences into the TAP program. Veterans who transitioned successfully into civilian roles emphasized the need for private sector involvement in the program to provide realistic insights into the job market.

Despite the mandatory nature of the TAP program, some veterans remain reluctant to participate, which can lead to further difficulties in their adjustment. The Commission underscored the need for ongoing support and encouragement for veterans and their families to engage with available resources.

Overall, the discussions at the meeting reflect a growing recognition of the complexities surrounding veteran transitions and the need for comprehensive support systems to address these challenges effectively. The Commission on Equity aims to advocate for improved resources and programs to better serve this population in Lacey and beyond.

Substance Abuse and Mental Health

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention is getting new permanent leadership. The Senate confirmed President Donald Trump’s pick Susan Monarez to serve as CDC director. She’ll be the CDC’s first director without a medical degree in more than 70 years. CDC laid off about 2,400 employees in April. But the agency reinstated about a third of them. Nearly 600 employees took voluntary incentives to leave the agency and will be off its rolls by the end of the year.

The Office of Personnel Management is encouraging agencies to offer more skills-building opportunities to their employees. Several upskilling options already exist in government, like OPM’s rotational program for the cyber workforce. But OPM says agencies can do more to help employees take advantage of those options. Creating opportunities for feds to learn skills outside their day jobs can also pay off immensely. “It’s also about keeping employees fresh and engaged, and it can be a very sharp tool for morale, retention and even attracting talent in the first place,” said Jeff Bardwell, OPM’s acting director of strategic workforce planning, and senior advisor for HR workforce programs.

The Defense Department says it has not been affected by the recent wave of cyberattacks targeting critical vulnerabilities in Microsoft SharePoint. DoD Chief Information Officer Katie Arrington said last week that DoD has been conducting forensic investigations and holding daily calls with Microsoft since the vulnerability was publicly disclosed. The attacks have already compromised more than 400 organizations worldwide and impacted several government agencies, including the Departments of Energy, Homeland Security and Health and Human Services. The Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency is still accessing the impact of these attacks on federal and state agencies.

A top official in charge of the federal government's real estate portfolio is stepping down. Michael Peters, commissioner of the Public Buildings Service at the General Services Administration is leaving the agency. Peters recently told staff that PBS would begin an agency reorganization next week. Peters joined GSA at the start of the Trump administration and set a goal of cutting the amount of federal real estate in half. PBS planned to cut 63% of its total workforce and has already laid off entire regional offices. This is the second major GSA leadership shakeup in as many weeks. Michael Rigas, the deputy secretary of state for management and resources, took over as acting GSA administrator last week.

The Trump administration is reminding agencies of its authority over all Schedule G hires. The Office of Personnel Management says the White House will have to approve any of those hires agencies want to make. That requirement mirrors the process for Schedule C, which is also reserved for recruiting political appointees. The new Schedule G hiring authority broadens agencies’ options for hiring non-career feds, beyond the existing Schedule C category. The Trump administration says the existing Schedule C authority left a gap in agencies’ ability to fill policy-making and policy-advocating roles.

The Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency is out with new guidance to help agencies stop hackers in their tracks. CISA’s new zero trust guidance focuses on how agencies can microsegment their networks. The goal is to ensure hackers and malware can’t spread far beyond a breached device or account. The guidance is part of a new series CISA is producing called the “journey to zero trust.” Much of the document is non-technical and focuses on how management can embrace microsegmentation. The concept brings better cybersecurity, but requires careful planning to avoid disrupting the network and users.

New legislation that’s moving quickly in Congress would require the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency to release a major report on security gaps in U.S. telecommunications networks. Oregon Senator Ron Wyden’s bill requiring the report’s release within 30 days unanimously passed the Senate on Tuesday. Wyden has been pressing CISA for years to release the unclassified report “U.S. Telecommunications Insecurity 2022.” But the agency has refused. Wyden is currently holding up the nomination of Sean Plankey to be CISA director until the agency agrees to release the document. Wyden says it contains vital and shocking information about threats to U.S. phone systems.

A bipartisan group of congressional lawmakers are pushing to eliminate TRICARE premiums for dependents under age 26. Congressional lawmakers want to bring TRICARE in line with most civilian health insurance plans by allowing military dependents to remain on their parents’ coverage until age 26 without paying additional premiums. If passed, the Health Care Fairness for Military Families Act would align TRICARE eligibility with the Affordable Care Act, which requires most civilian insurance plans to cover dependents until they turn 26 at no extra cost. Under current TRICARE rules, dependents are only covered until age 21, or 23 if they are full-time students.

Small Business Administration head Kelly Loeffler is putting federal contracting officers on notice about fraud and waste in the 8(a) small business contracting program. In a letter to all agencies, she's reminding all federal contracting officers that it’s their responsibility to report possible fraud or abuse of the socioeconomic program. Loeffler says contracting officers must ensure “that federal awards go to legitimate, eligible small businesses,” and must report potential misconduct, including entities that knowingly submit false information, conceal disqualifying facts or other abuse.” This letter comes after Loeffler ordered a full scale audit of the 8(a) program earlier this month. The audit is in response to the Justice Department’s findings of a years-long fraud and bribery scheme involving a former federal contracting officer and two 8(a) contractors.

Please be reminded that balance billing TRICARE beneficiaries is prohibited under the TRICARE West Region.

What is Balance Billing?

Balance billing occurs when a provider bills a TRICARE beneficiary for any amount exceeding the TRICARE-allowable charge after TRICARE has processed the claim.

A provider seeking any payment from a beneficiary, other than the applicable deductible and cost-sharing amounts for TRICARE/CHAMPUS-covered services may be in violation of federal billing regulations.

Noncompliance may impact your TRICARE and/or Medicare status. Balance billing requirements apply to both network and non-network providers who treat TRICARE beneficiaries. Both network and non-network providers are encouraged to explore all available options to resolve claims issues.

For more information, visit the TRICARE Balance Billing and Collection Activities section of the Provider Handbook.

However, the demands of military life, including frequent relocations, deployments, and reintegration stress, can significantly impact adolescent mental health,” said Dr. Kasi Patterson, Service Chief of the CAPH and Child & Adolescent Embedded Behavioral Health Program.

(July 30, 2025)– Alexander T. Augusta Military Medical Center (ATAMMC) continues to demonstrate its unwavering commitment to military families through its Child and Adolescent Partial Hospitalization (CAPH) Program, a vital initiative that provides comprehensive mental health care for TRICARE-eligible adolescents between the ages of 12 and 18.

For nearly 30 years, CAPH has delivered evidence-based, day-treatment mental health services in a structured, therapeutic setting, serving as a lifeline for military-connected youth facing depression, anxiety, ADHD, Autism Level I, and parent-child relational issues. By combining medical excellence with compassion and community integration, the program helps young patients stabilize and thrive without the disruption of inpatient hospitalization.

“Military families live with resilience, adaptability, and service at their core. However, the demands of military life, including frequent relocations, deployments, and reintegration stress, can significantly impact adolescent mental health,” said Dr. Kasi Patterson, Service Chief of the CAPH and Child & Adolescent Embedded Behavioral Health Program. “Traditional outpatient care may not provide the intensity or consistency needed to support these youth, while inpatient hospitalization may be too disruptive. The CAPH bridges the gap in care by offering a high-intensity, family-centered alternative.”

Purpose-Driven and Accessible

Operating Monday through Friday from 7:30 a.m. to 3:00 p.m. (with early dismissal at noon on Thursdays), the CAPH offers a full day of structured programming, combining individual, group, and family therapy with therapeutic community activities tailored to meet the unique needs of each participant. Patients return home each evening, preserving essential family and school connections.

Located on the 1st floor (Sunrise Entrance) of ATAMMC, the program is open to families enrolled in both TRICARE Prime and TRICARE Standard, and there are no co-pays for military beneficiaries, including those of retired service members. For families traveling from out-of-state or overseas, the Fisher House offers free lodging, ensuring accessibility to care without added logistical or financial burden.

A Holistic, Therapeutic Environment

The CAPH program is based on the principles of therapeutic community and social systems theory, empowering patients to take responsibility in a supportive environment that encourages emotional growth, resilience, and reintegration. An interdisciplinary care team, including psychiatrists, psychologists, nurses, social workers, and behavioral health technicians, collaboratively supports each patient’s recovery journey.

Beyond clinical care, CAPH also plays a vital role in training the next generation of military behavioral health professionals, serving as a teaching site for psychiatry residents and fellows.

World-Class Care for a Deserving Population

As one of the few programs of its kind within the Military Health System, ATAMMC’s CAPH continues to set the standard for adolescent mental health care across the Department of Defense.

“The program’s design allows youth to receive intensive, individualized treatment while staying connected to their family, school, and military community,” added Dr. Patterson. “It’s not just about healing, it’s about restoring confidence, relationships, and readiness at every level.”

WHAT’S THE IMPACT The Arkansas law would have barred companies that own PBMs from also holding a pharmacy license.
PBMs act as third-party administrators of prescription drug programs for commercial health plans, self-insured employer plans, Medicare Part D plans and state government employee plans.
They ostensibly are tasked with maintaining the formulary, contracting with pharmacies, negotiating discounts and rebates with drug manufacturers, and processing and paying prescription drug claims.
The American Medical Association released data last September showing that the four largest pharmacy benefit managers in the country control roughly 70% of the national market.","A federal judge has struck down a new law in Arkansas that would have banned pharmacy benefit managers from owning or operating pharmacies in the state.

In the decision, U.S. District Judge Brian Miller granted a preliminary injunction preventing the law from taking effect, saying that it may violate the U.S. Constitution's Commerce Clause. He said the law is also likely preempted by TRICARE, a healthcare program serving military members and their families.

Specifically, Miller found that the law emphasized protecting locally operated pharmacies over those affiliated with PBMs, thereby undermining its constitutionality, and said it interferes with national contracts for prescription drug services.

WHAT’S THE IMPACT

The Arkansas law would have barred companies that own PBMs from also holding a pharmacy license. It had been set to take effect Aug. 5, but CVS and Express Scripts sued over the law's implementation. The Associated Press reported that Republican Attorney General Tim Griffin planned to appeal the court's decision.

PBMs act as third-party administrators of prescription drug programs for commercial health plans, self-insured employer plans, Medicare Part D plans and state government employee plans. They ostensibly are tasked with maintaining the formulary, contracting with pharmacies, negotiating discounts and rebates with drug manufacturers, and processing and paying prescription drug claims.

But the nation's three largest PBMs – CVS Caremark, Express Scripts and OptumRx – are owned by companies that operate their own pharmacy chains, which prompted Arkansas Governor Sarah Huckabee Sanders to sign the PBM bill into law. Independent pharmacies have complained that PBMs operated by larger conglomerates abuse their leverage to benefit their own pharmacy businesses.

Miller shot down several arguments from the PBM plaintiffs but said they were likely to succeed on their claims related to the Commercial Clause, which limits the power of states to interfere with interstate commerce.

THE LARGER TREND

The ""Big 3"" pharmacy benefit managers – CVS Caremark, Express Scripts and OptumRx – mark up specialty drugs at their affiliated pharmacies by hundreds or even thousands of percent, according to a January staff report from the Federal Trade Commission.

Such significant markups allowed the largest three PBMs and their affiliated specialty pharmacies to generate more than $7.3 billion in revenue from dispensing drugs in excess of the drugs' estimated acquisition costs from 2017 to 2022, the report found.

These PBMs netted significant revenue at a time when patient, employer and other healthcare plans sponsor payments for drugs steadily increased on an annual basis, the FTC said.

The findings build on a report issued by FTC staff in July 2024 that found that pharmacies affiliated with the Big 3 PBMs received 68% of the dispensing revenue generated by specialty drugs in 2023, up from 54% in 2016.

The American Medical Association released data last September showing that the four largest pharmacy benefit managers in the country control roughly 70% of the national market.

The analysis, based on 2022 data on commercial and Medicare Part D prescription drug plan (PDP) enrollees, also found a high prevalence of vertical integration of PBMs with health insurance companies.

CVS Health is the largest PBM (with a 21.3% market share), followed by OptumRx (20.8%), Express Scripts (17.1%) and Prime Therapeutics (10.3%).",http://www.healthcarefinancenews.com/sites/hfn/files/2025-07/pills_docs_pharmacy_RUNSTUDIO_Getty%20Images.jpg,N,0.0,2025-07-30 14:56:36.227377

Prasad stepped down following a series of controversial decisions related to a treatment for boys with Duchenne muscular dystrophy, according to Stat News.

“Dr. Prasad did not want to be a distraction to the great work of the FDA in the Trump administration and has decided to return to California and spend more time with his family,” a spokesperson for the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services told CNN on Tuesday.

CNN reports that according to a person familiar with the matter who was granted anonymity to describe the internal dynamics, Prasad’s departure came amid fresh pressure from the White House for him to resign, and followed days of criticism from Laura Loomer, a right-wing activist with extraordinary access to President Donald Trump.

READ: AcmeSolv wins $43 billion contract by the Defense Health Agency (July 28, 2025)

Prasad had been defended by FDA Commissioner Dr. Marty Makary just days ago; in an interview with Politico, Makary said Prasad is an “impeccable scientist … one of the greatest scientific minds of our generation.”

Dr. Vinay Prasad is a prominent hematologist-oncologist and health policy researcher known for his critical analysis of medical research, FDA drug approvals, and healthcare practices. He emphasizes the importance of rigorous evidence and transparency in the approval and use of new treatments, often highlighting cases where FDA decisions have been influenced by limited or low-quality data.

Prasad advocates for stronger standards in clinical trials and challenges the overuse of costly or unproven therapies in medicine. Through his writings, podcasts, and social media presence, he has become a respected voice in promoting evidence-based medicine and improving regulatory processes. While he is not affiliated with the FDA as an official member, his critiques and insights often target FDA policies, aiming to encourage reforms that better protect patients and improve healthcare outcomes. His work has sparked important conversations about balancing innovation with patient safety in modern medicine.

Check your DEERS record The first step is to check your DEERS record.
Update your DEERS record If you need to update or correct your DEERS record, do so immediately.
Maintain your DEERS record Throughout the year, you may experience changes that require you to update your DEERS record.
You can do this by making sure that every time you have a qualifying life event, you update your DEERS information.","JULY 30, 2025 – When was the last time you looked to see if your information in the Defense Enrollment Eligibility Reporting System is up to date? If it’s been a while, it’s extremely important to take time and log in to DEERS to review or update your information.

DEERS is key to managing military health benefits, supporting the needs of service members, retirees, and their family members. You should make sure to update your information in DEERS so your family can get the benefits they deserve.

The Defense Manpower Data Center operates DEERS. DEERS contains confidential information about the eligibility of service members, retirees, and their family members for benefit and privilege programs administered by the Department of Defense and the uniformed services. It shows if you and your family members are eligible for and enrolled in TRICARE benefits.

But the Defense Health Agency doesn’t administer DEERS—DMDC does. This means you’re responsible for keeping your DEERS information up to date. You should check your DEERS record on the milConnect website at least once every three months to make sure your family’s information is accurate. If you see anything that’s incorrect, get it fixed right away.

In addition to updating your own DEERS record, your service personnel office will sometimes update your DEERS record following important life events, like retirement. So, you should check your DEERS record often—even if you haven’t recently made updates yourself—to ensure it’s correct.

If your DEERS record is incorrect or outdated, it could lead to:

Delays in accessing health care, filing claims, and getting prescriptions

An inability for TRICARE to contact you about your health coverage

Unexpected bills for health care

Disenrollment from your TRICARE plan

Want to ensure this doesn’t happen to your family? Follow these steps to find and maintain your information in DEERS.

1. Check your DEERS record

The first step is to check your DEERS record. You can do this on the milConnect website. What are some things to check? As described in the TRICARE Qualifying Life Events Fact Sheet, your DEERS record lists your:

Service status

Family status

TRICARE coverage status and plan

Contact information, including phone number, mailing address, and email address

You should also review the information for each family member and confirm your personnel, service, and eligibility status are accurate.

Keep in mind, each family member must be registered in DEERS before they can have TRICARE coverage. If you’re a sponsor, you’re automatically registered in DEERS, but you must register your eligible family members.

2. Update your DEERS record

If you need to update or correct your DEERS record, do so immediately. Sponsors and family members can update their contact information. Your contact information includes your phone number, mailing address, and email address. Here are your options for updating your contact information in DEERS:

Online: Log in to the milConnect website

Phone: 800-538-9552 (TTY/TDD: 866-363-2883)

Mail:

DMDC/DEERS Support Office

Attention: COA

400 Gigling Road

Seaside, CA 93955-6771

Fax: 800-336-4416

If you need to add or remove family members, sponsors must do this in person promptly by going to their nearest ID card office. Only sponsors can add or remove family members. Call or check online for your ID card office’s operating hours and to make an appointment. Don’t forget to bring supporting documents, such as a birth certificate, marriage certificate, or divorce decree.

3. Maintain your DEERS record

Throughout the year, you may experience changes that require you to update your DEERS record. So, the third step is to continue to update your information as soon as a change occurs. You can do this by making sure that every time you have a qualifying life event, you update your DEERS information.

A QLE “unlocks” a 90-day period for you to make changes to your plan. Common examples of QLEs include:

Retiring or separating from active duty

Getting married

Giving birth or adopting

Moving

Becoming eligible for Medicare

Gaining or losing other health insurance

Following these steps will help you avoid any break in your TRICARE coverage. Unlock your health by going to DEERS to learn more.",https://www.militaryspot.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/240813-O-D0202-1001.png,N,0.0,2025-07-30 12:56:35.945820

Today’s Military Health System relies on multiple online platforms — each with a specific purpose. Understanding them, and how they’re evolving, can help you make the most of your health coverage.

Keep in mind: TRICARE doesn’t own these platforms. Other agencies or contractors do. But you can visit the TRICARE All Logins page for a comprehensive list.

Here’s what to know.

One healthcare system, several portals

There’s no single portal that does it all. Instead, different login platforms support different parts of your benefit. Generally, they fall into three categories:

Updating personal information and enrollment in the Defense Enrollment Eligibility Reporting System

Getting care at military hospitals and clinics with MHS GENESIS

Getting civilian care through a TRICARE contractor

Here’s a look at each.

DEERS and milConnect/Beneficiary Web Enrollment

DEERS is the foundation of TRICARE eligibility. The milConnect website lets you update contact information, check your enrollment status, and access Beneficiary Web Enrollment tools. You can use this platform to:

Enroll in or change TRICARE plans

Update contact information, like your address or phone number

milConnect now uses myAuth, a new user-friendly secure login that is gradually replacing DS Logon. Keep reading to learn more about myAuth.

MHS GENESIS Patient Portal

If you get care at a military hospital or clinic, the MHS GENESIS Patient Portal is your main access point. You can:

View laboratory results

Request prescription refills

Make appointments

Send secure messages

You may also view your health records and appointment notes from military hospitals and clinics.

Regional contractor portals

Health care outside of military hospitals and clinics is administered by TRICARE contractors. Each has its own portal:

TRICARE East Region: Humana Military

TRICARE West Region: TriWest Healthcare Alliance

TRICARE Overseas: International SOS

TRICARE For Life (in all regions): WPS Military and Veterans Health

Use these portals to:

View claims

Check referrals

Find network providers

Pharmacy login

Express Scripts is the TRICARE Pharmacy Program contractor. Through their portal, you can switch eligible medications to TRICARE Pharmacy Home Delivery and:

Request new prescriptions

Refill prescriptions

Track your order status

Pay bills

Dental login

Are you enrolled in the TRICARE Dental Program? If so, United Concordia is your TRICARE dental contractor. Your United Concordia TDP My Account lets you:

View plan coverage details

Check claims history

View your dental explanation of benefits

Pay bills

What is myAuth?

myAuth is a new secure login option replacing DS Logon across Department of Defense systems. With myAuth, you can use your Common Access Card or a username/password, plus a secure multi-factor authentication method. This lets you access multiple DOD websites with just one login.

Currently, myAuth is used on:

milConnect

ID Card Office Online

Over time, all DOD systems that use DS Logon will transition to myAuth. Until then, platforms may use either DS Logon or myAuth depending on their system. (Note: You must have an active DS Logon account to create a new myAuth account.)

Civilian health portals

If you see a civilian provider, your provider may use an electronic health record, or EHR, other than MHS GENESIS. The DOD doesn’t own these other EHRs. You’ll need to follow your provider’s instructions to sign in and view records or communicate with providers.

Bottom line

Managing your TRICARE benefit means knowing which login to use—and when. While it may seem complex, here’s a breakdown:

Use milConnect for enrollment and DEERS updates.

Use MHS GENESIS to see your records for care at military hospitals and clinics.

Use your TRICARE contractor’s portal to manage claims, view referrals, and pay bills.

When in doubt, visit TRICARE All Logins page to find the right access point.
