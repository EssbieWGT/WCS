The prohibition on “live fire” training involving animals is part of this year’s annual defense bill, although certain forms of animal use for wartime training will still be permitted.
Rep. Vern Buchanan, a Republican from Florida known for advocating animal rights, has been a vocal proponent of this change.

This includes operations that involve stabbing, burning, and blunt force, as well as the testing of weapons on live animals.","The U.S. military has announced a significant policy shift regarding its training practices, specifically the use of live animals such as pigs and goats in battlefield medical simulation exercises. This decision follows advancements in simulation technology that have rendered the practice obsolete. The prohibition on “live fire” training involving animals is part of this year’s annual defense bill, although certain forms of animal use for wartime training will still be permitted.

Rep. Vern Buchanan, a Republican from Florida known for advocating animal rights, has been a vocal proponent of this change. He lauded the decision as a significant step in alleviating unnecessary suffering in military training practices. “With today’s advanced simulation technology, we can prepare our medics for the battlefield while reducing harm to animals,” Buchanan stated. As Co-Chair of the Animal Protection Caucus, he expressed pride in leading efforts to eliminate traditional and inhumane training methods.

Despite this ban, the Defense Department will continue to permit various forms of training that involve inflicting trauma on animals. This includes operations that involve stabbing, burning, and blunt force, as well as the testing of weapons on live animals. While proponents of these practices assert that animals are anesthetized during such training and testing, animal rights groups argue that the use of animals in any form of trauma training should be discontinued altogether.

The Pentagon has deferred media inquiries regarding the new policy to the Defense Health Agency, which is responsible for overseeing training protocols. In response to the new ban, the agency indicated that it is reviewing the guidelines.

Advocacy groups, including People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals (PETA), have heralded the change as a victory for animal welfare. They claim it will spare thousands of animals from suffering and marks a transformative move towards more humane and relevant training technologies.

Historically, the military’s use of animals for trauma training has been questioned, with previous legislation aiming to curtail these practices. A Government Accountability Office (GAO) report indicated that the military had received mandates to transition toward human-based training methods. Specifically, a 2013 defense bill required the Pentagon to devise a strategy to reduce animal use, while a 2018 statute urged the maximum practical use of simulation technologies.

The GAO’s findings highlighted that while animals have been employed in medical training due to their biological similarities to humans, the effectiveness of using anesthetized pigs and goats has come under scrutiny. Critics, including the Physicians Committee for Responsible Medicine, argue that simulated training via “cut suits” worn by human actors provides a more accurate representation of battlefield wounds and conditions. Retired Navy doctor Erin Griffith emphasized the distinction, noting the critical difference in realism between caring for a living creature and responding to a wounded soldier requiring immediate intervention.

As the military moves forward with this revised policy, the focus remains on developing more humane and effective training methodologies that can better prepare medics for real combat scenarios.",https://news.ssbcrack.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/US-Military-Ends-Use-of-Live-Animals-for-Medic-Training.jpg,N,0.0,2025-12-20 15:56:20.089882

“Our military families deserve timely care and a clear path to raise concerns when the system falls short.
The Military CARE Act gives service members and their families a direct line to report care access issues and track their resolution, while ensuring Congress has the data needed to identify and fix systemic problems across the military health system,” Rep. Bacon said.
Too often, military families hit administrative roadblocks or long delays with no clear way to raise concerns or track whether problems are being fixed,” Rep. Houlahan said.
“The Military CARE Act ensures beneficiary experiences are captured, tracked, and reported – giving leaders and Congress the visibility needed to identify systemic issues and drive meaningful, lasting improvements for military families.","Washington, D.C. – Representatives Don Bacon (NE-02), Maggie Goodlander (NH-02), Steven Horsford (NV-04), Jen Kiggans (VA-02), and Chrissy Houlahan (PA-06) introduced the Military Care Access, Reporting, and Evaluation (Military CARE) Act, bipartisan legislation to modernize how TRICARE beneficiaries report and resolve health care access challenges at military treatment facilities.

The Military CARE Act addresses access-to-care gaps by creating a secure, standardized digital platform for TRICARE beneficiaries to submit and monitor care issues, requiring real-time notifications to patient advocates, directing the Defense Health Agency to analyze complaint trends each quarter, and mandating annual reports to Congress that outline challenges and corrective actions.

“Our military families deserve timely care and a clear path to raise concerns when the system falls short. The Military CARE Act gives service members and their families a direct line to report care access issues and track their resolution, while ensuring Congress has the data needed to identify and fix systemic problems across the military health system,” Rep. Bacon said. “I’m pleased to co-lead this vital effort with Rep. Horsford to strengthen access to care for the families who sacrifice so much in service to our nation.”

“Military families serve our nation and sacrifice so much for it, and they deserve a health care system that serves them just as well,” Rep. Horsford said. “Too many families struggle to get timely appointments or clear information, and they’re left without a reliable way to raise concerns or track whether problems are fixed. This bipartisan bill gives military families a real voice, gives providers the tools to respond quickly, and gives Congress the oversight needed to ensure servicemembers and their loved ones are never left behind.When we support our families, we strengthen the entire force.”

“Access to timely, reliable health care is both a personal issue and a readiness issue. Too often, military families hit administrative roadblocks or long delays with no clear way to raise concerns or track whether problems are being fixed,” Rep. Houlahan said. “The Military CARE Act brings transparency and accountability to the system by giving TRICARE beneficiaries a straightforward way to report access issues and ensures those concerns reach patient advocates and senior leaders. This bipartisan, commonsense bill helps Congress identify systemic gaps and ensures our military health system works for the people it’s meant to serve.”

“Today, America’s servicemembers, veterans, and military families are forced to fight endless red tape and navigate a confusing and deeply frustrating system to get the healthcare they have earned,” Rep. Goodlander said. “That’s not right. Our commonsense bipartisan bill will cut senseless red tape, restore basic accountability, and return the power back where it belongs: with patients. This bill is about ensuring accountability, strengthening readiness, and keeping the sacred promise we make to those who serve our country.”

“Without reliable data and transparency, access-to-care problems in the military health system remain unseen and unresolved,” Lt. Gen. Brian Kelly, USAF (Ret), President and CEO, Military Officers Association of America said. “The Military CARE Act ensures beneficiary experiences are captured, tracked, and reported – giving leaders and Congress the visibility needed to identify systemic issues and drive meaningful, lasting improvements for military families. MOAA is grateful for the bipartisan leadership of Reps. Horsford, Kiggans, Bacon, and Houlahan in advancing this critical reform and MOAA priority.”

The bipartisan Military Care Act, co-led by Reps. Don Bacon (NE-02) Steven Horsford (NV-04), Jen Kiggans (VA-02), Chrissy Houlahan (PA-06) also includes the following original cosponsors: Reps. Sanford Bishop (GA-02), Maggie Goodlander (NH-02), Sarah McBride (DE-AL), and James Moylan (GU-AL).

The legislation is endorsed by Army Aviation Association of America (AAAA), Air and Space Forces Association (AFA), Air Force Sergeants Association (AFSA), AMVETS, Blinded Veterans Association (BVA), Commissioned Officers Association of the U.S. Public Health Services (COA), Fleet Reserve Association (FRA), Gold Star Spouses of America, Jewish War Veterans of the United States of America (JWV), Military Chaplains Association (MCA), Military Officers Association of America (MOAA), National Military Family Association (NMFA), Naval Enlisted Reserve Association (NERA), Reserve Organization of America (ROA), Secure Families Initiative, Service Women’s Action Network (SWAN), SPARTA, The Enlisted Association (TREA), Tragedy Assistance Program for Survivors (TAPS), TRICARE for Kids Coalition (TFK), U.S. Army Warrant Officers Association (USAWOA), USCG Chief Petty Officers Association (CPOA), and Vietnam Veterans of America (VVA)

This prohibition is included in the latest annual defense bill, indicating a significant shift in military training methodologies. While the ban specifically targets live fire exercises involving animals, other forms of animal use for wartime training will continue.

The initiative was notably pushed forward by Congressman Vern Buchanan, a Republican from Florida, who has been a vocal advocate for animal rights. He described the decision as “a major step forward in reducing unnecessary suffering in military practices,” emphasizing that modern simulation techniques allow for effective preparation of medics without harming animals. Buchanan, serving as Co-Chair of the Animal Protection Caucus, expressed pride in contributing to efforts aimed at phasing out what he considers outdated and inhumane practices.

Despite this prohibition, Buchanan’s office noted that the Department of Defense will still permit training exercises that involve invasive procedures on animals, including stabbing and burning, as well as “weapon wounding,” which entails testing weaponry on animals. Animal rights advocates argue that animals used in these scenarios are typically administered anesthesia to minimize suffering.

The Defense Health Agency, responsible for overseeing medical training, affirmed its commitment to transitioning away from animal models while maintaining high standards of medical training. The establishment of a defense medical modeling and simulation office was highlighted as part of its ongoing efforts to provide realistic training scenarios for service members.

Organizations such as People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals (PETA) heralded this decision as a victory, claiming it will save thousands of animals each year and represents a progressive shift towards cutting-edge, human-relevant simulation technology.

While the exact frequency of animal use in military training remains unclear, there have been ongoing legislative efforts aimed at curtailing such practices.

The 2013 defense bill required the Pentagon to outline strategies for transitioning away from animal involvement in trauma training, while a 2018 law mandated that simulation technology be utilized as widely as possible, barring instances where animal use was deemed necessary by higher medical authorities.

The GAO report highlighted that live animals like pigs and goats were traditionally used in trauma training due to their anatomical similarities to humans, which provided needed realism in medical training situations. However, critics argue that these methods are inadequate in truly preparing medics for the realities of combat. The Physicians Committee for Responsible Medicine has stated that using anesthetized animals does not effectively simulate the experience medics face when treating injured soldiers. Erin Griffith, a retired Navy doctor and member of the committee, remarked that while the idea of caring for a living being may add a layer of realism, it does not capture the chaotic environment of real combat scenarios where injuries occur.

When critically ill or injured personnel require advanced medical transport, the Pacific Air Forces Critical Care Air Transport Team (PACAF CCATT) stands at the ready. Based at Joint Base Pearl Harbor-Hickam, this specialized unit within the 15th Medical Group (MDG) represents a vital medical asset, providing intensive care in the air and bridging the gap between injury site and definitive treatment.

“PACAF CCATT is not just another aeromedical evacuation team,” according to Major Joseph Broekelmann, 15th CCATT Flight Commander. “It's an upgraded capability designed to deliver critical care services akin to an Intensive Care Unit (ICU)—but airborne. Each deployable team is a finely tuned unit consisting of a critical care physician, critical care nurse, and respiratory care practitioner. The triad works in perfect sync, providing advanced monitoring, ventilation, and other life-saving interventions during patient transport.”

Maj. Broekelmann further stated that “the team’s dedication to excellence extends beyond deployments. To maintain their cutting-edge skills and ensure they remain clinically current, PACAF CCATT members are integrated at Tripler Army Medical Center. This unique partnership allows them to rotate through the Intensive Care Unit, Pediatric Intensive Care Unit, Operating Room, Respiratory Care Department, and Emergency Department, actively contributing to day-to-day healthcare delivery for TRICARE beneficiaries, while honing their expertise.” According to the Air Force Medical Service, the CCAT mission falls under Air Mobility Command. CCATT members are experienced in the care of critically ill or injured patients with multisystem trauma, head injuries, shock, burns, respiratory failure, multiple organ failure, and other life-threatening complications.

Some of the most common procedures and medications CCATT members administer in-flight include anti-blood clot medications, painkillers, and providing oxygen and ventilation.

The typical patient load for a standard CCATT is up to three critical patients, or up to six stabilized patients. The value of the CCATT was demonstrated last January, when a fireworks explosion on Oahu resulted in a mass casualty event with severely burned patients requiring advanced ventilatory support. PACAF CCATT, in collaboration with the U.S. Army Institute of Surgical Research Burn Team, successfully executed the first transport of six intubated patients in over two decades, onboard a C-17 Globemaster III, to a specialized burn center.

Maj. Broekelmann stated, “this mission highlighted the strategic value of having a highly trained, rapidly deployable critical care capability in the Indo-Pacific theater.”

The PACAF CCATT ensures the best possible chance of survival and recovery for those in dire need. In addition to fielding PACAF’s CCATT, 15 MDG supports the U.S. Air Force’s 15th Wing and operates a medical and dental clinic as part of Defense Health Network Indo-Pacific, delivering patient-centered and cost-effective outpatient health care for three wings and 65 geographically separated units across Joint Base Pearl Harbor-Hickam.",https://cdn.dvidshub.net/images/dvids_logo.svg,N,0.0,2025-12-20 11:56:30.442475

Seattle Children’s and Mary Bridge Children’s hospitals both provide some gender-affirming medical care, though Mary Bridge does not perform any gender-affirming surgeries for patients under 18 and, in August, cut its gender clinic waitlist.

“I’m very saddened that health care for children has yet again been politicized.","Pediatricians and legal experts in the state expressed outrage Thursday at a new federal effort to effectively ban gender-affirming care for minors nationwide, reminding Washingtonians that these medical services remain protected here.

The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services early in the day revealed proposed rules that would bar hospitals and other medical providers from receiving Medicare or Medicaid funds for any services if they also offer gender-affirming care to youth.

The proposals aim to prevent government insurers, like Medicaid and TRICARE, from paying for gender-affirming medication and procedures for trans and gender-diverse minors in the nearly two dozen states, like Washington, where such care is legal. These proposals are not final.

This is not about protecting kids,” Rebekah Gardea, co-executive director of community advocacy and outreach at the QLaw Foundation of Washington, wrote in an email. “It is about using trans children as political pawns and will have devastating consequences for families who are simply trying to keep their kids healthy and alive.”

Federal health agencies should expect to face strong pushback and legal challenges from advocacy organizations, families and providers in Washington, Gardea added. The QLaw Foundation is a Seattle-based legal association that provides services to LGBTQ+ communities in the state.

Gardea pointed to existing work on this front from state Attorney General Nick Brown’s office, including an ongoing lawsuit filed in February against the Trump administration over an executive order that sought to halt federal funding for pediatric gender-affirming care. Later that month, a federal judge in Seattle found the executive order to be discriminatory and issued a preliminary injunction that blocks the order while the case proceeds.

A federal judge in Maryland has issued a similar pause on the executive order in a separate lawsuit.

Brown’s office said in a post on social media Thursday afternoon that the proposed HHS rules are “cruel and unnecessary.”

“Under the law in Washington, necessary healthcare for transgender people is lawful and legally protected,” the post said. “Proposed rules are not the law – nothing has changed in Washington.”

Asked whether Brown might file a lawsuit over this latest threat to gender-affirming care for minors, a spokesperson said the attorney general’s office was “discussing our options.”

Despite the legal protections, Gardea said trans youth and their families already have experienced “chilling effects.” While there are private practices that continue to offer gender-affirming care for minors in Washington, several children’s hospitals have chosen to narrow their gender care services or shutter gender clinics altogether.

Seattle Children’s and Mary Bridge Children’s hospitals both provide some gender-affirming medical care, though Mary Bridge does not perform any gender-affirming surgeries for patients under 18 and, in August, cut its gender clinic waitlist. Children’s no longer lists surgeries on its gender clinic website; the hospital’s media relations office has declined to answer questions regarding the current status of care.

In statements Thursday, both hospitals said they were reviewing federal proposals to determine next steps.

“We remain committed to providing high-quality care to patients, their families, and the communities we serve,” a Mary Bridge spokesperson said. A Children’s spokesperson said the hospital would “continue to comply with all applicable laws” but didn’t respond to questions about which laws.

Kaiser Permanente, which also offers gender-affirming medication and mental health care to patients under 19, did not respond to a request for comment.

Other pediatric health experts in the state were quick to express horror at the news, though some said these federal steps were not unexpected.

Major medical associations in the U.S. – including the American Medical Association, the American Psychological Association and the American Academy of Pediatrics – recommend gender-affirming care to treat gender dysphoria, including for trans minors whose health providers deem hormone treatment and puberty blockers to be medically necessary. Gender-affirming surgeries are extremely rare for trans people under 18.

Dr. Lelach Rave, executive director of the Washington chapter of the American Academy of Pediatrics, said the Thursday announcement was “shocking, but also not surprising” – though she “wants us to continue to be shocked because normalizing this is not good for anyone.”

“We are concerned about the well-being of the teenagers we care for and their families,” Rave continued. “We know that when children are struggling with these issues, being able to have centers of excellence … where they can turn and get expert care and advice, is really important for their well-being – and sometimes for their very lives.”

The Thursday news comes a day after a divided House of Representatives approved legislation that would criminalize gender-affirming treatments for minors. On Wednesday, The Washington Post also reported HHS canceled several American Academy of Pediatrics grants aimed at reducing sudden infant deaths, prenatal substance exposure, birth defects and teen mental health problems.

Rave wondered if federal health officials unveiled the gender care proposals as a “technique to flood the field” and distract people from cuts happening to other pediatric care, she said.

“There’s so many horrible things going on at once,” Rave said. “I’m very saddened that health care for children has yet again been politicized.

According to a report on Thursday from the U.S. Attorney’s Office for the District of New Jersey, 60-year-old Jesse Foote previously pleaded guilty in Newark to a two-count indictment charging him with conspiracy to violate the Federal Anti-Kickback statute and conspiracy to commit health care fraud.

Prosecutors say Foote and his accomplices caused the submission of false and fraudulent claims to health care benefit programs amounting to more than $7.8 million for DME.

This occurred between December 2017 and March 2021, as Foote worked with overseas telemarking call centers, DME suppliers, telemedicine companies and doctors to submit fraudulent claims to health care benefit programs.

These programs included Medicare and TRICARE. Foote did so through a circular scheme of kickbacks and bribes.

Court documents and statements revealed that Foote controlled a marketing company, which he used to purchase patient “leads” from overseas telemarking companies.

The leads included information about Medicare and other beneficiaries as well as pre-written doctors’ orders for DME.

Prosecutors note that the call centers targeted Medicare beneficiaries and others with health insurance to convince them to accept DME, including orthotic braces, without considering medical necessity.

Foote reportedly paid bribes and kickbacks to telemedicine companies, which then paid bribes and kickbacks to doctors to obtain their orders for DME based on the leads.

In many cases, the doctors approved of the DME orders without contacting the beneficiary or making a bona fide assessment that the DME was medically necessary.

Foote would then sell the signed doctors’ orders to others that he arranged kickbacks with. The doctors’ orders were eventually submitted to DME suppliers.

These suppliers included those controlled by Foote, which submitted false claims for reimbursement to health care benefit programs such as Medicare, TRICARE and private insurance companies.

This is how Foote and his co-conspirators caused more than $7.8 million of false claims to health care benefit programs for DME.

Beyond the prison term he received this week, a judge also ordered Foote to pay $7,878,991 in restitution.

Foote will see his 30-month prison sentence followed by an additional three years of supervised release.

Agencies that contributed to the investigation include the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services’ Office of Inspector General and the U.S. Department of Defense’s Office of Inspector General.

(WTNH) — A Fairfield man was sentenced Friday to 30 months of imprisonment for his role in a $7.8 million durable medical equipment (DME) health care fraud scheme.

According to the U.S. Attorney for the District of New Jersey, 60-year-old Jesse Foote pleaded guilty to a two-count indictment charging him with conspiracy to violate an Anti-Kickback statute and conspiracy to commit health care fraud.

According to court statements and documents, Foot conspired with overseas telemarketing call centers, DME suppliers, telemedicine companies and doctors to submit false claims to health care benefit programs from December 2017 to March 2021. Foote defrauded Medicare and TRICARE through a circular scheme of kickbacks and bribes.

Foote controlled a marketing company where he purchased patient “leads” from overseas telemarketing companies, which consisted of information about Medicare and other beneficiaries and pre-written doctors’ orders for DME.

The overseas call centers then targeted Medicare beneficiaries and others with health insurance to persuade them to accept DME, which includes orthotic braces, without regard to medical necessity.

Court statements claim that Foote paid bribes and kickbacks to telemedicine companies, which paid bribes and kickbacks to doctors to obtain orders for DME based on leads. Through this, doctors often approved DME orders without having any contact with the beneficiary and without assessing whether the DME was medically necessary.

After this, Foote sold the signed doctors’ orders to others with whom he had kickback arrangements. These orders were submitted to DME suppliers, including suppliers controlled by Foote, which submitted false claims for reimbursement to health care benefit programs and private insurance companies.

Foote and his co-conspirators caused the submission of $7.8 million worth of false claims to health care benefit programs for DME.

Foote was additionally sentenced to three years of supervised release and ordered him to pay $7.8 million in restitution.",https://www.wtnh.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/100/2023/05/medical-costs.jpg?w=1280,N,-1.0,2025-12-19 16:56:24.587420

Animal rights groups say the animals are supposed to be anesthetized during such training and testing.
The Pentagon referred comment on the new policy to the Defense Health Agency, which oversees the training.
But groups such as the Physicians Committee for Responsible Medicine say anesthetized pigs and goats do little to prepare medics or corpsmen for treating wounded servicemembers.
“But replicating what it’s like when their buddy is shot and bleeding and awake is very different.”","WASHINGTON -- The U.S. military will stop its practice of shooting pigs and goats to help prepare medics for treating wounded troops in a combat zone, ending an exercise made obsolete by simulators that mimic battlefield injuries.

The prohibition on “live fire” training that includes animals is part of this year’s annual defense bill, although other uses of animals for wartime training will continue The ban was championed by Rep. Vern Buchanan, a Florida Republican who often focuses on animal rights issues.

Buchanan called the change “a major step forward in reducing unnecessary suffering in military practices.”

“With today’s advanced simulation technology, we can prepare our medics for the battlefield while reducing harm to animals,” he said in a statement to The Associated Press. “As Co-Chair of the Animal Protection Caucus, I’m proud to continue leading efforts to end outdated and inhumane practices.”

Buchanan’s office said the Defense Department will continue to allow training that involves stabbing, burning and using blunt instruments on animals, while also allowing “weapon wounding,"" which is when the military tests weapons on animals. Animal rights groups say the animals are supposed to be anesthetized during such training and testing.

The Pentagon referred comment on the new policy to the Defense Health Agency, which oversees the training. The agency said in an email that it's looking into the new ban.

Groups such as People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals declared victory, saying the change will spare the lives of thousands of animals each year and “marks a historic shift toward state-of-the-art, human-relevant simulation technology.”

It's unclear how often the military uses animals for training. Previous defense bills and other pieces of legislation have sought to reduce their use for trauma training, according to a 2022 report from the Government Accountability Office, an independent agency that serves Congress.

The 2013 defense bill required the Pentagon to submit a report that outlined a strategy for transitioning to human-based training methods, the GAO said. A 2018 statute required the secretary of defense to ensure the military used simulation technology “to the maximum extent practicable” or unless use of animals was deemed necessary by the medical chain of command.

The GAO report stated the animals are placed under anesthesia and then euthanized.

“Live animals such as pigs and goats are used in trauma training because their organs and tissues are similar to humans, they have biological variation that can complicate treatment and provide opportunities to control medical conditions,” the report stated.

But groups such as the Physicians Committee for Responsible Medicine say anesthetized pigs and goats do little to prepare medics or corpsmen for treating wounded servicemembers. They said the advent of “cut suits” that are worn by people are much better at mimicking an injured human who is moaning and writhing.

""The big argument is this is a living, breathing thing that they have to take care of and there’s this level of realism,"" said Erin Griffith, a retired Navy doctor and member of the physicians committee. “But replicating what it’s like when their buddy is shot and bleeding and awake is very different.”",https://i.abcnewsfe.com/a/5ee8288b-31d3-401c-9dbc-a8d42bede3a8/wirestory_d26f642efa6dc97e984bab352444408b_16x9.jpg?w=1600,N,0.0,2025-12-19 14:56:26.024098

They’re like, ‘Oh, of course, Congress doesn’t give an F about us,’” said Julia Eshelman, a long-time advocate for military IVF.
She eventually was able to have children using IVF, and founded Building Military Families Network to advocate for families who faced the same issue.
Because Tricare doesn’t cover IVF or IUI, many military families end up paying for treatments out of pocket.
Eshelman said IVF and comprehensive reproductive coverage is not only a personal issue for military families, but extends to larger military readiness.","As Congress began hashing out the annual defense bill, military families began to celebrate a major policy win they believed they had secured after years of fighting. The measure included new rules that would have granted Tricare coverage to women pursuing in vitro fertilization, or IVF, to become pregnant.

Then reports came out that the language in the law requiring the coverage for IVF and intrauterine insemination, or IUI, was cut. Military spouses who were betting on the new coverage to help grow their families say they feel insulted, abandoned, and are asking why their daily sacrifices aren’t enough for lawmakers to grant them this benefit to improve their quality of life. On Thursday, President Donald Trump signed the fiscal year 2026 National Defense Authorization Act into law.

“People are pissed, for the lack of a better word, about this. They’re like, ‘Oh, of course, Congress doesn’t give an F about us,’” said Julia Eshelman, a long-time advocate for military IVF. “For them not to think that our service members are deserving of that same level of health care is very insulting.”

Eshelman faced multiple pregnancy losses and infertility issues with her husband, who was in the military. She eventually was able to have children using IVF, and founded Building Military Families Network to advocate for families who faced the same issue.

Eshelman said advocates were surprised that the policy got pulled in December because it passed the House and Senate with bipartisan support. She says watching Congress remove IVF coverage from the defense bill was particularly galling because those same federal lawmakers were granted insurance coverage for the service in 2023 under a law passed by the Washington D.C. city council, she said.

Tricare does not cover IVF or IUI except in exceptionally rare cases when a servicemember can prove that a serious service-related illness or injury caused their infertility. The NDAA would’ve granted coverage for IVF and IUI treatments.

“If you don’t fall into that very narrow, very hard to prove, segmented population, then fertility treatments like intrauterine insemination, or IUI, or in-vitro fertilization, IVF, are not covered,” Eshelman said. “But for many people in the military and veteran community, they are gonna need the assistance of IUI or IVF because they have diseases like endometriosis, or there’s male factor in fertility that makes those assistive reproductive technologies necessary.”

‘Ethical’ IVF

MSNOW reported that House Speaker Mike Johnson quietly removed the measure from the defense bill. His office told the publication that he supported IVF with “pro-life protections” and “when it is done responsibly and ethically.”

Johnson and some Republicans often frame opposition to IVF in ethical terms, citing concerns commonly raised by Christian advocacy groups like Focus on the Family. Those groups often cite IVF as a threat to traditional marriage structures, particularly for couples who use a surrogate mother, or as antithetical to a “sanctity of human life,” because the process involves transferring, preserving and sometimes disposing of embryos.

Advocates who have spent years working on IVF issues bristle at such critiques.

“This term ‘ethical IVF’ is sort of made up,” said Barb Collura, former president of RESOLVE: The National Infertility Association. “It’s not defined in statute. It’s not a medical term. It’s something that I’ve really primarily heard [Johnson] say.”

IVF expansion policies appeared to gain a key supporter for Republican votes when President Donald Trump expanded IVF coverage and opportunities with an executive order in February and a series of policies in October.

“We want more babies, to put it very nicely,” Trump said according to a White House fact sheet announcing the October policies. “IVF treatments are expensive. It’s very hard for many people to do it and to get it, but I’ve been in favor of IVF, right from the beginning.”

Collura said Trump is the “first and only president” who has talked about IVF “in quite honestly pretty positive ways.”

Military families affected

A 2023 World Health Organization report found that 1 in 6 adults worldwide experience infertility. Some studies have found high rates of infertility among veterans who served in Iraq and Afghanistan, though no comprehensive study has assessed infertility rates among military families compared to the general population.

Because Tricare doesn’t cover IVF or IUI, many military families end up paying for treatments out of pocket. Additionally, families often find themselves with other costs, including bills related to storing fertilized eggs for later use, and mental health services to deal with the stress of infertility or miscarriages, said Courtney Deady, community support director for the Building Military Families Network.

Deady said the late NDAA changes were “a complete slap in the face.” Deady said she has one embryo still available to attempt IVF and her husband is in the National Guard, which means they are only covered by Tricare coverage when he is on active military orders.

“If it would have been put into the NDAA, we might have considered doing another retrieval to then continue on with that journey. However, that is not going to be the case,” she said. “We have a deployment coming up in [2027] and that was kind of our goal — we would do a transfer. If it worked, great. If not, then I would go through the retrieval process when he was deployed and I was on Tricare.”

Few military facilities offer treatment

Beyond the IVF costs that military families have to pay, even accessing treatments at the eight military facilities that offer it, is already extremely complicated. The majority of military treatment facilities that offer specific fertility treatments are located at bases on the east or west coasts and many have long waiting lists. Some military hospitals even enforce restrictions on who is eligible for care, according to Eshelman.

“They’re not able to meet the capacity or the need at these eight facilities,” Eshelman said. “And some of them have — like in San Antonio — they have a [body mass index] requirement to be able to be seen at their clinic and so if you don’t meet that BMI then you can’t be seen.”

When Eshelman and her active duty Reserve husband were living in Pennsylvania, they sought fertility treatment at Walter Reed National Military Medical Center in Bethesda, Maryland. But after looking at the costs for a hotel, travel and taking time off work, “it wasn’t worth it for us,” she said.

Eshelman said IVF and comprehensive reproductive coverage is not only a personal issue for military families, but extends to larger military readiness.

“By not providing this, you’re shrinking that number of people that are gonna generationally continue to serve,” she said. “Military families breed more service members and if military families can’t have a family, our all-volunteer force is going to suffer not only in that way, but retention and morale are also impacted.”

Bari Mutter, whose spouse is an active duty Air Force captain, said she’s spent $30,000 on IVF-related expenses in the last two years. The couple is now looking to opt for surrogacy, which is also not covered by Tricare, Mutter said, adding that she expects another $100,000 in costs.

“The whole thing is infuriating,” Mutter said. “My husband, that’s what he does, he serves our country. That’s his job and like to not get any benefit from it, it just sucks. I feel like we are on an island alone.”

Mutter’s husband joined the Air Force under a scholarship program that paid for his dental school. But the couple has decided that the benefits they were promised, like Tricare, are not worth it.

“The moment that he is out, he’s out. He will never sign back up again. We’re done. He would have done Reserve if Tricare was worth it,” Mutter said. “It’s a couple weeks a month, he would have been more than willing to do it, but he’s not.”

Advocates are now hoping legislation introduced in April in the House and Senate for the same policy can move forward.",https://taskandpurpose.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/BCC_EshelmanFamily-22-e1766153909655.jpg?w=1200,N,-1.0,2025-12-19 13:56:23.957133

The Armed Forces Health Surveillance Division's Global Emerging Infections Surveillance Branch (part of Defense Health Agency Public Health) hosted its 3rd Annual Science Summit in Silver Spring, Maryland, Sept. 10-12. This meeting highlighted cutting-edge, next-generation sequencing, or NGS, methods in use across the GEIS network and the value of genomic data for informing decision-makers. Attendees included representatives from more than 15 domestic and global organizations within the GEIS network, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, and the Department of Homeland Security. The outcomes of this meeting were aimed to inform the strategic direction for the GEIS branch in the context of the larger Department of War public health and biosurveillance priorities.

“This meeting is an extension of our efforts in the GEIS program office to bring together world-class experts focused on improving the interoperability of genomic sequencing data, ultimately advancing the DOW’s biodefense posture,” said Lt. Col. Brett Swierczewski, chief of the GEIS branch.

Keynote speakers included Acting Deputy Assistant Secretary of War Theresa (Tracie) Lattimore and Joint Staff Surgeon Brig. Gen. Clinton Murray, both of whom underscored the crucial role of biosurveillance and the GEIS network in supporting military operations around the globe.

The summit provided an opportunity for knowledge exchange and open dialogue on current priorities and emerging issues in the NGS and bioinformatics space. Topics included the practical applications of pathogen-agnostic sequencing (a method designed to spot any infectious agent, not just ones you already suspect) for respiratory pathogen surveillance, vector surveillance, and wastewater surveillance; pathogen-agnostic sequencing deployed in the field; and digital biobanking, big data transfer and storage. Other emerging challenges included pathogen-agnostic sequencing for biothreats and engineered threats, and the utility of surveilling for antimicrobial resistance in wastewater.

As highlighted in the 2023 Biodefense Posture Review, NGS technologies provide critical information for early biothreat detection and genomic characterization. Enhanced genomic surveillance capabilities within DOW medical and public health laboratories enable experts to rapidly detect and characterize infectious disease threats, including those encountered in field settings. However, effectively and efficiently interpreting and communicating the complex data generated from these new surveillance modalities remain key challenges.

The GEIS program is actively addressing these communication challenges. A mini-tabletop exercise at the summit focused on improving communication of early biothreat-surveillance findings. This exercise aimed to evaluate the process of communication after the detection of a novel pathogen and the challenges of translating complex genomic data into actionable information for decision-makers.

Summit participants also discussed the strategic implementation of pathogen-agnostic genomic surveillance across the GEIS network.

Pathogen-agnostic surveillance, when used with effective communication strategies and quality assurance programs, could enhance the DOW’s ability to detect, characterize and respond to threats, said Swierczewski. It doesn’t matter if the threat’s origin is natural, accidental or intentional. This approach reduces dependence on pre-existing knowledge of circulating pathogens within an operational area.

Because pathogen-agnostic sequencing is resource-intensive, the GEIS Branch emphasizes strategic implementation to prepare for both the ""most likely"" and the ""most dangerous"" biothreat scenarios.

Two presentations highlighted key GEIS branch efforts to improve the quality and accessibility of data generated using pathogen-agnostic sequencing methods:

The Pathogen Detection Project enhances pathogen-agnostic sequencing reliability within the GEIS network by uncovering weaknesses in wet-and-dry lab workflows, promoting standardized protocols, and improving bioinformatics expertise through comparative analysis. Addressing these challenges minimizes errors, optimizes sequencing platform usage, and ultimately increases the accuracy and confidence in pathogen identification across different DOW laboratories.

Military Health System Digital Biobank enables the GEIS network to better implement pathogen-agnostic surveillance by providing a centralized genomic data repository and the potential to rapidly share early sequence data for analysis and interpretation. This facilitates collaboration, large-scale analyses, and reach-back support within the DOW.

Each session sparked in-depth discussions, fostering deeper connections between GEIS partner laboratories and opening avenues for interagency collaborations.

“The GEIS summit serves as the premiere forum for exchanging information on the value of genomic sequencing technology and how it can be leveraged to benefit the warfighter,” said Navy Capt. Carlos Williams, deputy chief of the DHA Public Health’s Armed Forces Health Surveillance Division. “It is imperative that we maintain and expand these capabilities now to set the theater for the Geographic Combatant Commands, mitigating the potential impact of biothreats on military operations.”

Strengthening the Ready Medical Force Operational and tactical medical forces require equipment that performs under extreme conditions.
From battlefield stabilization to enroute care to theater hospitalization, rugged tablets and laptops ensure continuity, accuracy, and speed in treatment.
Enhancing Military Health Care Delivery Military healthcare is a complex blend of people, systems, and resources.
Rugged tablets and laptops remain essential tools for that transformation, supporting readiness, accelerating modernization, and strengthening medical capabilities worldwide.","The Military Health System (MHS) has always been clear about its mission: protect, sustain, and restore the health of those who serve, from active-duty and reserve personnel to retirees and military families. What continues to evolve is how the MHS delivers on that responsibility in an increasingly complex operational landscape.

Today, the demand for integrated medical readiness, real-time situational awareness, rapid decision-making, and resilient healthcare infrastructure is higher than ever. As the National Defense Strategy reinforces, the military must remain medically ready for combat and resilient against multi-domain threats. The military health system must, in turn, maintain a force of medical professionals who are themselves prepared to deliver care “anytime, anywhere.”

Rugged tablets and laptops are purpose-built, mission-tough, and designed to perform in the most austere environments, playing a pivotal role in operations of the military. These rugged mobile computers are precision-engineered and align directly with the MHS’s strategic goals: strengthening readiness, modernizing capability, and improving healthcare delivery across every echelon of care.

A Stronger, More Connected MHS Starts with Reliable Technology

Anchored in moving forward together with a shared commitment to beneficiaries and the readiness mission, the military’s modern health systems’ strategic pillars are interconnected:

Medically Ready Force

Ready Medical Force

Health Care Delivery Excellence

Across these pillars, mobile rugged computing bring unmatched value empowering providers, modernizing workflows, and enhancing care delivery. Rugged tablets and laptops are not simply tools; they are force multipliers that help stabilize the MHS, support its workforce, and strengthen the integrated health system.

Rugged Computing Supports Health Readiness Anywhere Care Is Needed

1. Enabling the Medically Ready Force

Maintaining a force with the mental, physical, and cognitive resilience required for sustained operations relies heavily on accurate health surveillance, accessible records, and rapid response to health threats.

DT Research rugged tablets support:

Real-time EHR access through secure, CAC-enabled systems

Environmental and exposure monitoring in training or deployment environments

Mobile health readiness checks for pre-deployment and reintegration

Telehealth support for remote units and geographically isolated teams

2. Strengthening the Ready Medical Force

Operational and tactical medical forces require equipment that performs under extreme conditions. From battlefield stabilization to enroute care to theater hospitalization, rugged tablets and laptops ensure continuity, accuracy, and speed in treatment.

Military medical teams can:

Document care at the point of injury

Access treatment protocols in seconds

Transmit medical data during evacuation

Synchronize with joint systems to reduce errors and delays

Maintain visibility of supplies, blood products, and equipment

This level of reliability helps reduce clinical variability, enhance patient safety, and streamline care.

3. Enhancing Military Health Care Delivery

Military healthcare is a complex blend of people, systems, and resources. The shift toward digital, integrated, and interoperable systems is essential to:

Improving access to care

Supporting complex patient needs

Enriching clinical experience for medical providers

Controlling rising healthcare costs

Rugged tablets and laptops designed for all-day use in clinics, field hospitals, or forward operating bases give providers the digital tools they need while reducing hardware failure, supporting EHR modernization, and enabling seamless data flow across the enterprise.

Empowering the Workforce: A Critical MHS Priority

The military health system emphasizes that healthy, educated, and supported personnel take better care of people. Technology must therefore protect, not burden, its medical professionals.

Rugged tablets contribute to this goal by:

Reducing administrative fatigue with streamlined workflows

Offering ergonomic, lightweight, purpose-built computing systems

Supporting training with simulations, diagnostics, and digital reference materials

Allowing providers to work confidently in any lighting, weather, or terrain

When clinicians have reliable, intuitive tools, burnout decreases, and care quality increases.

Accelerating Modernization and Digital Health Implementation

Rugged computers such as rugged tablets and laptops have always been committed to MHS implementing digital health from home to clinic to battlefield, which is directly aligned with rugged computing. The ability to deliver timely, accurate, and actionable information is only possible with devices that withstand operational demands.

Rugged technology supports modernization by enabling:

Real-time telemedicine and remote consultations

Secure access to advanced diagnostics and imaging

Predictive analytics and AI-enhanced decision support

Integration with biosensors, wearables, and medical IoT devices

Field data capture for public health surveillance and biodefense

Whether supporting R&D initiatives, biodefense preparedness, or large-scale emergency response, rugged tablets keep medical teams connected and informed.

Interoperability and Joint Force Integration

A modern MHS requires seamless interoperability across services, partner nations, and civilian health systems. Rugged tablets and laptops serve as the mobile backbone for:

Joint health service capabilities

Cross-platform EHR access

Unified communication between installations

Coordination during humanitarian missions and disaster relief

With rugged tablets and laptops, medical teams stay connected even when communications infrastructure is degraded.

Preparing for the Future of Military Medicine

As the global health and national security environment grows more complex, the MHS is evolving into a more resilient, integrated, and technology-enabled system. Rugged tablets and laptops remain essential tools for that transformation, supporting readiness, accelerating modernization, and strengthening medical capabilities worldwide.

At DT Research, we are committed to designing reliable, secure, and mission-ready technology that helps the MHS deliver on its promise: “to care for those who serve, strengthen the readiness of the Total Force, and support the nation’s military mission anytime, anywhere.”",,N,1.0,2025-12-19 08:56:33.986615

The shift in federal healthcare policy stems directly from President Donald Trump’s Jan. 28 executive order, Protecting Children From Chemical and Surgical Mutilation, which formally establishes U.S. opposition to gender-affirming care and pledges to end federal funding for such treatments.

The executive order outlines a broader effort to align HHS with the Trump-Vance administration’s policy goals and executive actions. Those actions include defunding medical institutions that provide gender-affirming care to minors by restricting federal research and education grants, withdrawing the 2022 HHS guidance supporting gender-affirming care, requiring TRICARE and federal employee health plans to exclude coverage for gender-affirming treatments for minors, and directing the Justice Department to prioritize investigations and enforcement related to such care.

HHS has claimed that gender-affirming care can “expose them [children] to irreversible damage, including infertility, impaired sexual function, diminished bone density, altered brain development, and other irreversible physiological effects.” The nation’s health organization published a report in November, saying that evidence on pediatric gender-affirming care is “very uncertain.”

The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services is now in the process of proposing new rules that would bar hospitals from performing what the administration describes as sex-rejecting procedures on children under age 18 as a condition of participation in Medicare and Medicaid programs. Nearly all U.S. hospitals participate in Medicare and Medicaid. HHS said that “this action is designed to ensure that the U.S. government will not be in business with organizations that intentionally or unintentionally inflict permanent harm on children.”

Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. released a statement alongside the announcement.

“Under my leadership, and answering President Trump’s call to action, the federal government will do everything in its power to stop unsafe, irreversible practices that put our children at risk,” Kennedy said. “This administration will protect America’s most vulnerable. Our children deserve better — and we are delivering on that promise.”

Those claims stand in direct opposition to the positions of most major medical and healthcare organizations.

The American Medical Association, the nation’s largest and most influential physician organization, has repeatedly opposed measures that restrict access to trans health care.

“The AMA supports public and private health insurance coverage for treatment of gender dysphoria and opposes the denial of health insurance based on sexual orientation or gender identity,” a statement on the AMA’s website reads. “Improving access to gender-affirming care is an important means of improving health outcomes for the transgender population.”

Jennifer Levi, senior director of transgender and queer rights at GLBTQ Legal Advocates and Defenders, warned the proposed changes would cause significant harm.

“Parents of transgender children want what all parents want: to see their kids thrive and get the medical care they need. But this administration is putting the government between patients and their doctors. Parents witness every day how their children benefit from this care — care backed by decades of research and endorsed by major medical associations across the country. These proposed rules are not based on medical science. They are based on politics. And if allowed to take effect will serve only to drive up medical costs, harm vulnerable children, and deny families the care their doctors say they need. These rules elevate politics over children — and that is profoundly unAmerican.”

Human Rights Campaign President Kelley Robinson echoed Levi’s sentiments.

“The Trump administration is relentless in denying health care to this country, and especially the transgender community. Families deserve the freedom to go to the doctor and get the care that they need and to have agency over the health and wellbeing of their children,” Robinson said. “But these proposed actions would put Donald Trump and RFK Jr. in those doctor’s offices, ripping health care decisions from the hands of families and putting it in the grips of the anti-LGBTQ+ fringe. Make no mistake: these rules aim to completely cut off medically necessary care from children no matter where in this country they live. It’s the Trump administration dictating who gets their prescription filled and who has their next appointment canceled altogether.

The announcement comes just days after U.S. Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene (R-Ga.) advanced legislation in Congress that would make it a felony to provide gender-affirming care to a child.

By: Najla Alexander

NJ authorities announced that a Connecticut man was sentenced yesterday to 30 months’ imprisonment for his role in a multimillion-dollar durable medical equipment (DME) health care fraud and kickback scheme.

Senior Counsel Philip Lamparello stated that Jesse Foote, 60, of Fairfield, Connecticut, previously pleaded guilty before U.S. District Judge Esther Salas in Newark federal court to a two-count information charging him with conspiracy to violate the Federal Anti-Kickback statute and conspiracy to commit health care fraud.

According to documents filed in this case and statements made in court:

From December 2017 to March 2021, NJ officials stated that Foote conspired with overseas telemarketing call centers, DME suppliers, telemedicine companies, and doctors to submit fraudulent claims to health care benefit programs, including Medicare and TRICARE, through a circular scheme of kickbacks and bribes.

Foote controlled a marketing company through which he purchased patient “leads” from overseas telemarketing companies, NJ officials say. The leads consisted of information on Medicare and other beneficiaries, as well as pre-written doctors’ orders for DME.

According to NJ officials, the telemarketing call centers targeted Medicare beneficiaries and others with health insurance to persuade them to accept DME, including orthotic braces, without regard to medical necessity. Foote paid bribes and kickbacks to telemedicine companies, which in turn paid bribes and kickbacks to doctors, to obtain doctors’ orders for DME based on the leads.

The doctors often approved the DME orders without contacting the beneficiary or making a bona fide assessment of the DME's medical necessity. Foote then sold the signed doctors’ orders to others with whom he had kickback arrangements, NJ authorities stated.

The doctors’ orders were ultimately submitted to DME suppliers, including DME suppliers controlled by Foote, which submitted fraudulent claims for reimbursement to health care benefit programs, including Medicare, TRICARE, and private insurance companies, NJ officials say.

In total, according to NJ officials, Foote and his co-conspirators caused the submission of false and fraudulent claims to health care benefit programs totaling more than $7.8 million for DME.

In addition to the prison term, Judge Salas sentenced Foote to three years of supervised release and ordered him to pay $7,878,991.56 in restitution, NJ officials said.",https://www.rlsmedia.com/sites/default/files/styles/og_image/public/field/image/article/IMG_1234_2.jpeg?h=508231ee&itok=FdiPgxDs,N,0.0,2025-12-18 16:56:36.061727

The Company expects to file its Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q for the second and third quarters of 2025 in the coming weeks.

“Today’s filing represents another important step in our efforts to bring our financial reporting current,” said Elias Sabo, CEO of Compass Diversified. “We remain focused on strengthening our financial flexibility and executing across our subsidiary businesses. Despite a dynamic operating environment, our operating subsidiaries, excluding Lugano, continue to perform well and collectively generate significant cash flow.”

Sabo added, “Looking ahead, we are focused on the key drivers of performance across our subsidiaries—driving operational excellence, disciplined working capital management, and investing in our differentiated products and brands. We’re encouraged by recent strong booking activity at Arnold and PrimaLoft. BOA continues to benefit from its patent-protected performance-enhancing fit solutions, supporting ongoing market share expansion. And 5.11 is navigating macro pressures with duty-smart sourcing and tighter inventory discipline while it continues to invest in its brand.”

Sabo continued, “Our priorities are clear: execute at our subsidiaries, generate cash, and use that cash to reduce leverage while continuing to support growth initiatives across our businesses. Long term, we remain committed to maximizing shareholder value and will continue to explore opportunities for the most efficient return of capital to our shareholders.”

2025 Outlook (Reiterated)

CODI reiterates its expectation for full-year 2025 subsidiary Adjusted EBITDA of $330 million to $360 million, excluding Lugano.

Note Regarding Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures

Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted Earnings (Loss) are non-GAAP measures used by the Company to assess its performance. We have reconciled Adjusted EBITDA to Income (Loss) from Continuing Operations and Adjusted Earnings (Loss) to Net Income (Loss) on the attached schedules. We consider Income (Loss) from Continuing Operations to be the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure to Adjusted EBITDA and Net Income (Loss) to be the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure to Adjusted Earnings (Loss). We believe that Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted Earnings (Loss) provides useful information to investors and reflect important financial measures as each excludes the effects of items which reflect the impact of long-term investment decisions, rather than the performance of near-term operations. When compared to Net Income (Loss) and Income (Loss) from Continuing Operations, Adjusted Earnings (Loss) and Adjusted EBITDA, respectively, are each limited in that they do not reflect the periodic costs of certain capital assets used in generating revenues of our businesses or the non-cash charges associated with impairments, as well as certain cash charges. The presentation of Adjusted EBITDA allows investors to view the performance of our businesses in a manner similar to the methods used by us and the management of our businesses, provides additional insight into our operating results and provides a measure for evaluating targeted businesses for acquisition. The presentation of Adjusted Earnings (Loss) provides insight into our operating results.

Pro forma net sales is defined as net sales including the historical net sales relating to the pre-acquisition periods of The Honey Pot Co., assuming that the Company acquired The Honey Pot Co. on January 1, 2024. We have reconciled pro forma net sales to net sales, the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure, on the attached schedules. We believe that pro forma net sales is useful information for investors as it provides a better understanding of sales performance, and relative changes thereto, on a comparable basis. Pro forma net sales is not necessarily indicative of what the actual results would have been if the acquisition had in fact occurred on the date or for the periods indicated nor does it purport to project net sales for any future periods or as of any date.

In reliance on the unreasonable efforts exception provided under Item 10(e)(1)(i)(B) of Regulation S-K, we have not reconciled 2025 Subsidiary Adjusted EBITDA to its comparable GAAP measure because we do not provide guidance on Net Income (Loss) from Continuing Operations or the applicable reconciling items as a result of the uncertainty regarding, and the potential variability of, these items. For the same reasons, we are unable to address the probable significance of the unavailable information, which could be material to future results.

Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted Earnings and pro forma net sales are not meant to be a substitute for GAAP measures and may be different from or otherwise inconsistent with non-GAAP financial measures used by other companies.

Management to hold webcast today at 5:00 pm Eastern

New York, N.Y., Dec. 18, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- NANO Nuclear Energy Inc. (NASDAQ: NNE) (“NANO Nuclear” or “the Company”) , a leading advanced nuclear micro modular reactor and technology company focused on developing clean energy solutions, today reported its fiscal year 2025 financial results and provided a business update.

Figure 1 - NANO Nuclear Reports Fiscal Year 2025 Financial Results and Provides Business Update

During its 2025 fiscal year ended September 30, 2025 and subsequently, NANO Nuclear achieved significant milestones as it strives to be the leading advanced nuclear microreactor developer in North America. Key achievements included:

Acquiring the patented KRONOS MMR ™ Energy System , advancing the design toward initiation of the licensing process and prototype construction in the U.S. and Canada, and developing a growing pipeline of commercial opportunities.

Continuing advancement of commercial vertical integration efforts to participate in key aspects of the nuclear fuel supply chain, a corporate goal which distinguishes NANO Nuclear from its competitors.

Expanding its physical plant to include an engineering, research and development, and demonstration facility in Oak Brook, IL, while also receiving a $6.8 million award from the State of Illinois as part of the Reimagining Energy and Vehicles (REV) Illinois program.

Significantly expanded executive and technical teams to include personnel with meaningful industry experience.

Raising over $600 million from a growing number of prominent institutional investors.

“We are extremely proud of the hard work our team put in, the milestones we achieved, and the value we created for our investors and stakeholders in 2025,” said Jay Yu, Founder and Chairman of NANO Nuclear .

“Our efforts have positioned NANO Nuclear at the center of a global nuclear renaissance driven by several durable long-term macro trends, including growing demand for reliable baseload energy to support growth in AI data centers and electrification of various industries, clean energy mandates and energy independence, and unprecedented global support for nuclear energy. AI data centers are projected to be the primary driver of significantly higher electricity usage in the coming years, and a lack of sufficient transmission infrastructure is expected to constrain the traditional grid’s capacity to meet forecasted power growth, with even conservative growth estimates expected to require substantial grid expansion. All of this represents a fundamental shift that is placing an even greater emphasis on scalable and constant sources of baseload power that can operate independently from grid constraints. This is exactly where advanced reactors, and particularly our KRONOS MMR ™ , offer a compelling advantage.”

“2025 was a transformative year for NANO Nuclear, marked by disciplined execution across several parts of our business. We advanced the KRONOS MMR ™ meaningfully — from acquiring the asset out of bankruptcy, to securing our strategic collaboration with the University of Illinois, achieving important Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) milestones, completing the necessary site characterization and drilling work for our planned first quarter 2026 construction permit application with the NRC. We also made significant progress toward resuming formal licensing activities for the KRONOS MMR ™ with the Canadian Nuclear Safety Commission. Financially, we remain well-capitalized, raising over $600 million since our May 2024 IPO with growing support from prominent institutional investors and numerous index and ETF additions. Equally as important, we continue to make substantial commercial progress, highlighted by a feasibility study agreement with BaRupOn to evaluate up to 1 GW of power with our KRONOS MMR ™ , an AFWERX Direct to Phase 2 contract to evaluate siting our KRONOS MMR™ at Joint Base Anacostia Bolling, and a growing pipeline of potential customers from several different markets.”

“In summation, we believe that through hard work and disciplined execution, we’ve laid a very strong foundation from which we can continue to work towards achieving our near- and long-term goals. We look forward to continued progress in 2026.”

Financial Results for Twelve Months Ended September 30, 2025

Fiscal Fourth Quarter 2025 Consolidated Financial Review

Total revenue for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2025 decreased $35.4 million or 10% to $319.0 million compared to the same period last year. The decrease was primarily driven by the Marketing & Distribution segment, where a decrease in average per-unit avocado sales prices of 27% was partially offset by a 13% increase in avocado volume sold. Price and volume movements resulted from greater availability of Mexican fruit due to harvest disruptions in the previous year and higher Peruvian avocado production driven by more favorable weather conditions in the current year.

Gross profit was $55.7 million in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2025, consistent with the prior year, while gross margin increased 180 basis points compared to the same period last year, to 17.5% of revenue. The margin increase was driven by lower revenues compared to last year, resulting from lower per-unit pricing, as the Marketing & Distribution segment margin is primarily managed on a per-unit basis.

Selling, general and administrative expense (“SG&A”) for the fourth quarter increased $0.5 million or 2% to $27.7 million, compared to the same period last year primarily due to higher general operating costs, inclusive of performance-based stock compensation expense, partially offset by lower statutory profit-sharing expense in the Peru and Mexico operations.

Net income attributable to Mission Produce for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2025 was $16.0 million, or $0.22 per diluted share, compared to $17.3 million, or $0.24 per diluted share, for the same period last year.

Adjusted net income for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2025 increased 13% to $22.2 million, or $0.31 per diluted share, compared to $19.6 million, or $0.28 per diluted share, for the same period last year.

Adjusted EBITDA increased $4.5 million or 12% to $41.4 million for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2025, as compared to $36.9 million in the prior year period, driven primarily by increased owned avocado production in the International Farming segment and higher avocado volume sold in the Marketing & Distribution segment.

Fiscal Fourth Quarter Business Segment Performance

Marketing & Distribution

Net sales in the Marketing & Distribution segment decreased $47.7 million or 15% to $271.9 million for the fourth quarter, driven by the avocado volume and pricing dynamics described above. While pricing is driven by industry production dynamics, the Company manages the business primarily to volume and per-unit margins—leveraging its global platform and sourcing network to optimize per-unit margin performance regardless of the pricing environment.

Segment operating income increased $1.6 million or 9% and segment adjusted EBITDA increased $2.7 million or 11% compared to the same period last year, which is primarily attributed to higher avocado volume sold.

International Farming

The vast majority of fruit sales from the International Farming segment are made to the Marketing & Distribution segment, with the remainder of revenue largely derived from direct sales of fruit to third parties, as well as services provided to third-parties and the Blueberries segment. Affiliated sales are concentrated in the second half of the fiscal year in alignment with the Peruvian avocado harvest season, which typically runs from April through September of each year. As a result, adjusted EBITDA for the International Farming segment is generally concentrated in the third and fourth quarters of the fiscal year in alignment with the timing of sales.

Total sales in the International Farming segment for the fourth quarter increased $29.3 million or 97% to $59.6 million, compared to $30.3 million for the same period last year. Segment operating income improved by $4.7 million to $2.1 million compared to a loss of $2.5 million in the same period last year. Segment adjusted EBITDA increased $5.7 million or 211% to $8.4 million compared to $2.7 million for the same period last year. The increase was driven by higher yield from owned avocado orchards and supported by higher volume of avocado packing and cooling services provided to third parties.

Blueberries

Sales in the Blueberries segment have traditionally been concentrated in the first and fourth quarters of the fiscal year in alignment with the Peruvian blueberry harvest season.

Net sales in the Blueberries segment increased $4.9 million or 16% to $36.5 million for the fourth quarter, compared to $31.6 million for the same period last year, primarily due to higher volume produced on owned farms as a result of increased total acreage.

Segment operating income was $4.9 million for the fourth quarter compared to $11.6 million in the same period last year and segment adjusted EBITDA was $4.7 million compared to $8.6 million in same period last year. The decreases were due to higher unit costs resulting from lower projected yields per hectare in the current harvest season.

Balance Sheet and Cash Flow

Cash and cash equivalents were $64.8 million as of October 31, 2025, compared to $58.0 million as of October 31, 2024.

Net cash provided by operating activities was $88.6 million for the year ended October 31, 2025, as compared to $93.4 million last year, driven by higher working capital requirements. Working capital growth was primarily driven by lower grower payables, higher other assets and net movements in income tax receivable and payable balances, which were partially offset by lower accounts receivable and inventory balances and higher accounts payable balances. The movements in accounts receivable, inventory and grower payables correlated with reductions in avocado pricing levels. Other asset growth pertains to value-added tax balances in Mexico and Guatemala, while income tax movements are attributed to timing of payment requirements in operational taxing jurisdictions. Accounts payable growth is primarily attributed to higher farming production costs within our International Farming and Blueberries segments.

Capital expenditures were $51.4 million for the year ended October 31, 2025 compared to $32.2 million last year. Capital expenditures were comprised primarily of avocado orchard development, pre-production orchard maintenance and land improvements, packhouse construction in Guatemala and pre-production land development and blueberry plant cultivation in Peru.

Outlook

For the first quarter of fiscal year 2026, the Company is providing the following industry outlooks that will drive performance:

Avocado industry volumes in the fiscal 2026 first quarter are expected to increase by approximately 10% versus the prior year period, driven by a larger Mexican crop in the current harvest season.

Pricing is expected to be lower on a year-over-year basis by approximately 25% compared to the $1.75 per pound average experienced in the first quarter of fiscal 2025, driven by higher supply conditions.

The blueberries harvest season in Peru will peak during the first quarter. The Company expects to see volume increases from owned farms resulting from new acreage in production, which should translate to higher revenue, as average sales prices are expected to be flat to slightly higher. Profitability will continue to be impacted by higher costs resulting from lower projected yields per hectare in the current harvest season.

For full year fiscal 2026, total capital expenditure is expected to be approximately $40 million.

Adjusted net income (loss) refers to net income (loss) attributable to Mission Produce, before stock-based compensation expense, unrealized gain (loss) on derivative financial instruments, foreign currency gain (loss), farming costs for nonproductive orchards (which represents land lease costs), recognition of deferred ERP costs, advisory costs, amortization of inventory adjustments and intangible asset recognized from business combinations, further adjusted by any special, non-recurring, or one-time items such as remeasurement, impairment or discrete tax charges that are distortive to results, and tax effects of these items, if any, and the tax-effected impact of these non-GAAP adjustments attributable to noncontrolling interest, allocable to the noncontrolling owners based on their percentage of ownership interest.

Adjusted EBITDA refers to net income (loss), before interest expense, income taxes, depreciation and amortization expense, stock-based compensation expense, other income (expense), and income (loss) from equity method investees, further adjusted by asset impairment and disposals, farming costs for nonproductive orchards (which represents land lease costs), recognition of deferred ERP costs, advisory costs, and any special, non-recurring, or one-time items such as remeasurements or impairments, and any portion of these items attributable to the noncontrolling interest.

Reconciliations of these non-GAAP financial measures to the most comparable GAAP measure are provided in the appendices to this press release.

(1) Costs related to blueberry orchards were $0.3 million for both the three months ended October 31, 2025 and 2024, and $1.7 million and $2.5 million for the twelve months ended October 31, 2025 and 2024, respectively. Costs related to avocado orchards were $0.5 million for both the three months ended October 31, 2025 and 2024, and $1.8 million for both the twelve months ended October 31, 2025 and 2024.

(2) Represents costs recognized in cost of sales related to the closure of the Company’s Canadian distribution centers, including: accelerated depreciation expense on property, plant and equipment and operating lease right-of-use lease assets, early lease termination costs, severance costs, and gains on settlement of asset retirement obligations.

(3) Represents tariff charges levied on USMCA-compliant goods imported from Mexico for the three-day period from March 4th to March 6th, 2025. The extremely short-term nature of the charges prevented the Company from effectively passing the charges in both pricing to customers and prices paid for goods from suppliers. USMCA-compliant goods have subsequently been exempted from tariff charges on U.S. imports and additional adjustments are not expected in the future.

(4) Represents accelerated depreciation expense for certain blueberry plants determined to have no remaining useful life.

(5) Tax effects are calculated using applicable rates that each adjustment relates to.

(6) On September 10, 2025, Peru enacted tax law repealing current tax law which provided benefits to agribusiness entities. The new law subjects us to lower Peruvian corporate income tax rates than the rate in effect on the date of repeal of 25%, as follows: 15% for calendar years 2026 to 2035 and 29.5% thereafter. We remeasured our deferred tax balances based on the applicable tax rate in the year the deferred balances are expected to reverse.

(7) Represents net income or loss attributable to noncontrolling interest plus the impact of tax-effected non-GAAP adjustments, allocable to the noncontrolling owner based on their percentage of ownership interest.

Includes zero amortization of the Blueberries finance lease for both the three months ended October 31, 2025 and 2024 and $0.7 million for both the twelve months ended October 31, 2025 and 2024. The twelve months ended October 31, 2025 also include $0.9 million of accelerated depreciation expense from fixed assets related to the closure of our Canada facilities during the second quarter. The twelve months ended October 31, 2024 also include $4.1 million of accelerated depreciation expense, $2.0 million of which was from purchase accounting assets, for certain blueberry plants determined to have no remaining useful life.

(3) Represents charges recognized in cost of sales related to the closure of our Canada facilities, including: accelerated amortization of operating lease right-of-use assets, early lease termination costs and severance costs, partially offset by gains on settlement of asset retirement obligations.

(4) Represents tariff charges levied on USMCA-compliant goods imported from Mexico for the three-day period from March 4th to March 6th, 2025. The extremely short-term nature of the charges prevented the Company from effectively passing the charges in both pricing to customers and prices paid for goods from suppliers.

HIGH POINT, N.C., Dec. 18, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- vTv Therapeutics Inc. (Nasdaq: VTVT), a late-stage biopharmaceutical company, today announced a Phase 2 clinical study protocol developed in collaboration with M42’s Insights Research Organization & Solutions (IROS), a leading United Arab Emirates (UAE)-based contract research organization, has been submitted to the Department of Health (DOH) Abu Dhabi. The study is designed to evaluate the safety and efficacy of cadisegliatin , a potential first-in-class oral adjunctive therapy to insulin, in people living with type 2 diabetes. This study constitutes the longest trial investigating cadisegliatin to date and will be a 12-month, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled trial enrolling approximately 300 patients with type 2 diabetes who are treated with insulin for glycemic control. Participants will be randomized into three arms: two cadisegliatin dose groups (400 mg and 800 mg once daily) and a placebo control group. The trial will take place in the UAE, Jordan, and Tunisia, with the first patient first visit expected in the first quarter of 2026.

“Through our collaboration with M42, we continue to investigate cadisegliatin ’s potential as an adjunctive therapy to insulin for people living with diabetes,” said Paul Sekhri, Chairman, President, and CEO of vTv Therapeutics. “This study also expands the potential geographic footprint for cadisegliatin .”

“The launch of this trial enables us to evaluate the safety and efficacy of cadisegliatin over the course of one year in people with insulin-dependent type 2 diabetes, allowing for extended observation of the impact of our investigational oral adjunctive therapy,” said Thomas Strack, MD, Chief Medical Officer of vTv Therapeutics.

“Collaborating with vTv Therapeutics on this Phase 2 study positions us to explore opportunities to potentially impact the lives of millions of people with type 2 diabetes who are not currently able to maintain glycemic control,” said Islam Altantawy, General Manager at IROS. “Given that the prevalence of type 2 diabetes among UAE nationals is among the highest globally, we see potential for cadisegliatin to assist in glucose management efforts in this population.”

As part of the collaboration between vTv and M42, vTv is the regulatory sponsor of the trial and M42 is funding the study.

About Cadisegliatin

Cadisegliatin (TTP399) is a novel, oral small molecule, liver-selective glucokinase activator being investigated in the US as a potential first-in-class oral adjunctive treatment for type 1 diabetes (T1D). In non-clinical studies, cadisegliatin , acting selectively on the liver, increased the activity of glucokinase independently from insulin which supports clinical investigation of improvement in glycemic control through hepatic glucose uptake and glycogen storage. Cadisegliatin has been granted Breakthrough Therapy designation by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA).

Cadisegliatin is under investigation, and the safety and efficacy have not been established. There is no guarantee that this product will receive health authority approval or become commercially available for the use being investigated.

About vTv Therapeutics

vTv Therapeutics is a late-stage biopharmaceutical company focused on developing oral, small molecule drug candidates intended to help treat people living with diabetes and other chronic diseases. vTv’s clinical pipeline is led by cadisegliatin , currently in a US Phase 3 trial, a potential first-in-class oral glucokinase activator being investigated for the treatment of type 1 diabetes. vTv and its development partners are investigating multiple molecules across different indications for chronic diseases.

MOUNTAIN VIEW, Calif., Dec. 18, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Heartflow, Inc. (Heartflow) (Nasdaq: HTFL), the leader in AI technology for coronary artery disease (CAD), announced the American College of Cardiology (ACC) and the American Heart Association (AHA) published new scientific statements supporting the prognostic value of quantifying coronary plaque and reinforcing the critical role of the coronary computed tomography angiography (CTA) + Heartflow pathway in CAD patient management. The ACC’s consensus recommendations, published this week in JACC: Cardiovascular Imaging , highlight the importance of quantitative plaque assessment and underscore the benefits of adopting AI-powered Heartflow Plaque Analysis for personalized, precision cardiac care. 1 The ACC statement elevates plaque analysis from an emerging technology to a defined clinical consideration in CAD management, outlining appropriate patient selection and best practices for interpreting and reporting.

In direct alignment with the ACC’s call for rigorous quality assurance, reproducible results, and “human in the loop” analysis, Heartflow delivers a differentiated standard for clinical plaque quantification by combining AI-driven analysis with expert quality review. Heartflow Plaque Analysis is the only FDA-cleared, AI-powered plaque quantification tool with 95% agreement to the gold standard, IVUS, using blinded core lab adjudication. 2 This rigor, together with Heartflow’s commitment to standardized reporting and advanced algorithmic approaches such as adaptive thresholds, reflects a level of validation and quality oversight consistent with ACC guidance.

The AHA statement, published recently in Circulation , reinforces plaque burden and composition as central in managing nonobstructive CAD. 3 The expert authors emphasize that patients with nonobstructive CAD should not be considered low-risk, recognizing that coronary plaque burden, extent, and composition are major determinants of outcomes. Earlier this year, a commission perspective published in The Lancet called for a fundamental shift in managing CAD, urging clinicians to focus on identifying and managing plaque early, before the opportunity for prevention has been lost. 4 Together, the scientific statements from ACC and AHA reinforce that broader paradigm shift toward understanding plaque burden, not just artery obstruction, in modern CAD management.

“The ACC and AHA scientific statements address an important need by providing evidence-based consensus recommendations for clinicians and imagers, solidifying coronary CTA-based quantitative plaque analysis as a powerful tool for enhanced risk stratification in patients with suspected CAD,” said Ron Blankstein, M.D., writing committee member for both the ACC and AHA statements, Director of Cardiac Computed Tomography at Brigham and Women's Hospital, and Professor of Medicine and Radiology at Harvard Medical School. “These statements highlight the limitations of current methods to assess risk based on risk factors or stenosis severity alone. Integrating AI-powered technology into clinical practice using ACC and AHA’s guidance can help clinicians move beyond diagnosing blockages, toward predicting and preventing major cardiovascular events.”

Both the ACC and AHA scientific statements support the use of quantitative coronary plaque analysis to identify high-risk patients, enabling the immediate and appropriate initiation of preventive treatment. Heartflow Plaque Analysis addresses the need to quantify disease following visual detection of plaque, and is delivered instantly upon order to maintain seamless clinical integration and enable timely clinical decision-making.

“The ACC and AHA scientific statements signal growing consensus that plaque assessment is essential for risk stratification, prevention, and long-term CAD management. Heartflow Plaque Analysis enables more precise risk stratification for personalized, preventive treatment plans,” said Campbell Rogers, M.D., F.A.C.C., Chief Medical Officer at Heartflow. “The expert guidance articulates the need for rigorous validation and standardization, which Heartflow is uniquely positioned to address, given our technology and quality systems already align with these stringent recommendations. We are energized by the opportunity to continue collaborating with clinicians as a catalyst to redefine and improve precision cardiovascular care.”

The ACC and AHA’s scientific statements reflect a growing body of clinical evidence further substantiating the prognostic significance of Heartflow Plaque Analysis. A retrospective analysis of symptomatic patients from a cohort of the FISH&CHIPS Study presented at the AHA Scientific Sessions 2025 provided the largest validation to date of the Heartflow Plaque Staging framework based on total plaque volume measurement as a predictor of future heart attacks or cardiovascular death. 5 The company is generating additional real-world evidence through the DECIDE registry , the largest prospective registry evaluating the clinical impact of Heartflow Plaque Analysis on medical management decisions. The DECIDE registry showed that more than 50% of patients had their medical management changed when Plaque Analysis with Plaque Staging* was added compared to their management based on CCTA alone. 6

The hospital is the first Army military treatment facility selected by the Defense Health Agency to pilot SWORD, a digital platform that uses motion-tracking sensors and remote clinical oversight to deliver physical therapy care outside the clinic.
This data is reviewed by licensed physical therapists who adjust treatment plans and communicate with the patient directly through the platform.
The system is designed for patients with mild to moderate musculoskeletal pain and serves as an alternative to in-person physical therapy at Martin Army.
Maj. Madeline Merriam, chief of Physical Therapy, is spearheading the pilot and said the platform addresses one of the most persistent barriers to recovery: time.","Martin Army Community Hospital has launched a new virtual physical therapy pilot aimed at strengthening Soldier readiness by meeting patients where duty takes them. The hospital is the first Army military treatment facility selected by the Defense Health Agency to pilot SWORD, a digital platform that uses motion-tracking sensors and remote clinical oversight to deliver physical therapy care outside the clinic.

SWORD provides patients with a tablet loaded with guided exercise sessions. As patients complete their movements, artificial intelligence corrects forms and measures completion of exercises. This data is reviewed by licensed physical therapists who adjust treatment plans and communicate with the patient directly through the platform. The system is designed for patients with mild to moderate musculoskeletal pain and serves as an alternative to in-person physical therapy at Martin Army.

Maj. Madeline Merriam, chief of Physical Therapy, is spearheading the pilot and said the platform addresses one of the most persistent barriers to recovery: time.

“SWORD Health PT is a great alternative to physical therapy at Martin Army for active-duty service members with mild to moderate pain who have a difficult time making it into the clinic for treatment or active-duty family members who do not want to be seen on the network,” Merriam said.

For Soldiers, the challenge is not a lack of willingness; it’s the mission. Packed training schedules, field exercises, and TDY travel often make it challenging to attend routine therapy appointments. With SWORD, Soldiers can bring their recovery with them, maintaining mobility and strength even while away from the installation.

Although SWORD is cleared for a wide range of musculoskeletal needs, it cannot treat toe or foot pain, finger or hand pain, or jaw pain. Patients with those conditions will continue receiving traditional in-person care.

The soft launch started this month, and Merriam’s team, along with providers in Primary Care, are now offering SWORD to eligible patients as needs arise. Direct access to SWORD will begin in the new year.

Martin Army’s role in piloting SWORD builds on its selection as one of DHA’s Accelerating Care Transformation venture sites. Over the past year, the hospital has implemented several new virtual tools, including My Military Health Quick Care Connect, DHA’s virtual urgent care option. SWORD adds another layer to that modernization effort by extending rehabilitation care wherever Soldiers and families are—at home, at work, or in the field.

While active-duty family members can also use SWORD instead of being referred off-post, the heart of the mission remains clear: ensuring Soldiers remain ready to fight. Consistent, accessible therapy supports performance, reduces recovery setbacks, and strengthens long-term musculoskeletal readiness.

SWORD ensures recovery continues even when training, travel, or long workdays disrupt a normal schedule. With therapy that can go wherever a Soldier goes, the platform supports the hospital’s commitment to keeping the force healthy, mobile, and ready for whatever the mission requires.",https://d1ldvf68ux039x.cloudfront.net/thumbs/photos/2512/9452069/1000w_q95.jpg,N,1.0,2025-12-18 18:56:28.062692

Editor’s note: The Carl R. Darnall Army Medical Center has begun a Behavioral Health Initiative to inform the community with information and resources that will help with everyday struggles like stress management, nutrition and physical health, emotional intelligence, and healthy habits. This article focuses on maintaining healthy stress levels during the holiday season.

FORT HOOD, Texas – The holiday season is a time of celebration, connection, and reflection, but it can also bring increased stress, disruptions to routines, and challenges to maintaining healthy habits. Carl R. Darnall Army Medical Center encourages service members, families, retirees, and community members to take proactive steps to care for their mental, nutritional, and physical health—and to take advantage of the many resources available on post and in the local area.

“Maintaining your health during the holidays doesn’t require perfection or even a large time commitment,” said Col. Amit Gupta, Fort Hood director of psychological health and chief of behavioral health CRDAMC. “It’s about balance—recognizing stress early, making small healthy choices, and knowing when to ask for support. Use your CRDAMC providers, who want nothing more than to care for this community every step of the way.”

Managing Holiday Stress

Holiday stress can come from many sources, including busy schedules, financial strain, travel, and separation from loved ones. Recognizing stress early and using healthy coping strategies can help prevent it from becoming overwhelming.

“Stress can affect both mental and physical health, especially when routines are disrupted,” notes Capt. Chelsea Yueng, a CRDAMC behavioral health nurse. “Reaching out early—whether to a provider, counselor, chaplain, or trusted individual—can make a significant difference.”

Helpful strategies include:

Maintain Routines: Stick to consistent sleep schedules when possible.

Set Attainable Expectations: Unrealistic expectations cause resentment and disappointment.

Set Realistic Goals: Prioritize what’s most important and don’t be afraid to say no.

Stay Connected: Make time for friends, family, and trusted coworkers.

Col. Jolanda L. J. Walker, Munson Army Health Center director, served as master of ceremonies. Colors were presented by Soldiers from the Fort Leavenworth Chapter of the Sergeant Audie Murphy Club. Army, Marine Corps, Navy and Air Force service members assigned to the Fort Leavenworth-based U.S. Army Command and General Staff College, and a coast guardsman from the U.S. Coast Guard Pay & Personnel Center, Topeka, Kansas, presented ceremonial wreaths representing each branch of the U.S. Armed Forces and an additional wreath honoring Prisoners of War.

Despite the frigid conditions Saturday morning—temperatures around the mid-20s with wind chills near below zero, attendees braved the cold to stand together in remembrance.

“It was incredibly meaningful for me to be among the volunteers here today,” said Walker. “Even in this extreme cold, we gathered to speak the names of our fallen heroes. Each wreath we lay and every name we speak keeps their memory alive.”

As each wreath is placed at the base of a gravestone, volunteers read the service member’s name aloud ensuring each individual is remembered and honored for their service. Volunteers in uniform also render a salute.

“That act of remembrance connects us to their service and sacrifice and keeps their memory alive. I’m grateful to every volunteer who stood out here today and encourage everyone to learn more about the individuals we honor,” Walker said.

Following the ceremony, additional volunteers dispersed throughout the cemetery to place more than 5,000 wreaths on gravestones.

Wreaths Across America is held annually across the nation on the second or third Saturday of December, uniting communities, installations, and organizations in remembrance of those who served.

The John P. Murtha Cancer Center (MCC) at Walter Reed National Military Medical Center, the Department of War’s only Center of Excellence for cancer care, recently hosted its 2025 Cancer Prevention Summit at the medical center.

Physicians and subject matter experts in cancer prevention, care and research discussed a range of topics during the summit, including cancer survival in the Military Health System (MHS), cancer incidence and survival by military occupation, cancer risk mitigation, the future of cancer care (early detection and interception), and next-generation cancer screening, among other issues.

“Cancer is a readiness issue,” said Dr. Craig D. Shriver, director of the MCC and MCC Research Programs (MCCRP). A retired colonel in the U.S. Army, Shriver added that more than 1,500 active-duty service members are diagnosed with cancer annually among “the healthiest, generally young, and most active of the nation’s population. “Every one of them is important to the military and warfighter readiness. When we lose one to treatment for a while, or [the service member] has to be transitioned out of the military, it impacts readiness,” said Shriver.

Dr. Kimberly Robins, of the MCCRP, explained that factors impacting cancer incidence include exposures such as occupational hazards, demographics (age, sex, race/ethnicity), lifestyle factors (tobacco use, diet, physical activity, obesity) and genetic predispositions. She added that factors that affect cancer detection, diagnosis and treatment include access to care, screening practices, medical surveillance and reporting completeness.

“The MHS provides universal access to care,” Robins stated. She added that cancers among MHS beneficiaries are more likely detected and earlier detected because of the military’s requirement for regular health exams. However, some military occupations may increase the risk of certain cancers, studies have shown.

Better detection in military medicine

For most cancer sites, the incidence was lower in the military than the general population, particular among younger individuals, Robins stated. She added there’s a higher incidence in the military for prostate, thyroid and breast cancers, especially among older individuals, and higher incidence rates in the military were observed for localized breast, prostate, thyroid, soft tissue sarcoma, and Hodgkin lymphoma. Again, this may be because of the military emphasis on regular health exams and its universal access to care for its beneficiaries, which also may contribute to earlier detection.

Dr. Jie Lin, also of the MCCRP, agreed that the overall cancer mortality rate has been declining steadily since the early 1990s, mostly in the most common cancers such as lung, colorectal, breast and prostate cancers. “The decline results from early detection of some cancers, smoking reduction and treatment,” she added. “With the universal access to health care, MHS beneficiaries with cancer have improved survival outcome compared to the patients in the U.S. general population,” Lin said.

U.S. Air Force Col. (Dr.) Ian Stewart, vice chair for clinical research at the Uniformed Services University (USU), discussed traumatic brain injury [TBI] and the subsequent risk of brain cancer. “We found that moderate/severe TBI and penetrating TBI, but not mild TBI, were associated with the subsequent development of brain cancer. Given that TBI is a common injury incurred in the course of military service, further research is needed,” he added.

Lifestyle modifications: diet, exercise, regular exams

U.S. Air Force Maj. (Dr.) Zachary Rupert, a preventive medicine physician at USU and Walter Reed, said lifestyle modifications can reduce cancer risk. He explained that this includes reducing the consumption of ultra-processed foods and eating more fruits and vegetables while decreasing red meats and sugar-sweetened beverages. In addition, he encouraged people to be physically active to help avoid excess body weight, which can increase the risk of some cancers. He also encourages people to avoid use of tobacco and limit alcohol intake. He also urged people to protect themselves from the sun’s dangerous UV rays.

Rupert added that studies have estimated that about roughly 40 percent of cancer cases in the United States in 2019 were attributable to modifiable risk factors including smoking, secondhand smoke exposure, nutrition, lack of exercise, ultraviolet radiation exposure, and several carcinogenic infections.

Dr. Juvianee Estrada-Veras, head of genetics in the MCCRP, said, “Advancements in genetic testing, risk assessment, and understanding of the natural history of these syndromes may lead to more personalized monitoring strategies [for cancer risk mitigation]. Tumor surveillance is a critical component of managing hereditary cancer predisposition syndromes. Early detection through tailored strategies for children and adults saves lives, improves outcomes,” he added.

“We can change the cancer experience through early detection and intervention,” said Dr. Betsy O’Donnell, director of the Multi-Center Early Detection Clinic at the Dana Farber Cancer Institute. She said clinical pathways for accurate diagnostic evaluations are evolving providing a tremendous opportunity for research – clinical, translational and basic – for early cancer detection.

Multi-cancer detection (MCD) tests aim to close the gap between traditional [and targeted] screening for cancers, explained MCCRP pathologist Kristen Natale. “Traditional screening saves lives, but it leaves many cancers undetected,” she added. MCD assays include cancer-related biomarkers, which circulate in blood; and next-generation sequencing, used to detect a wide range of genetic mutations, she explained. In addition, multi-omics combines genomic data with other biological information, and proprietary artificial intelligence algorithms “analyze complex data and identify patterns that may indicate cancer,” she stated.",https://d1ldvf68ux039x.cloudfront.net/thumbs/photos/2512/9451607/1000w_q95.jpg,N,1.0,2025-12-18 16:57:15.157765

Health implications for service members Numerous studies have revealed concerning health consequences from microplastic exposure.
Particularly alarming for service members are studies showing that microplastics were present in 99% of post-mortem lung tissue autopsies.
The key is incorporating protective habits into daily routines, much like other health and safety practices many service members already follow.
Resources Deployment and Environmental Health – The Defense Centers for Public Health- Aberdeen provides services and information pertinent to maintaining and improving environmental health on installations and in deployment locations.","Service members face health risks both while at home and when deployed, and the emerging global threat of micro- and nanoplastics, or MNPs, may have long-term impacts on their health.

""We’re beginning to appreciate that microplastics are everywhere and likely contaminating everything we eat, drink, and touch,"" said Dr. Mark Williams, a toxicologist with Defense Health Agency-Public Health in Aberdeen, Maryland.

The scale of the plastic crisis

The root of this emerging health threat lies in the global plastic production growth and humans’ increasing reliance on plastic products, said Williams.

Plastic production has exploded from just 2 megatons in 1950 to 475 megatons in 2022, a nearly 240-fold increase in just over 70 years, said Williams. Projections show this trend continuing, with production expected to nearly triple again to more than 1,200 megatons by 2060.

""By far the highest proportion of plastic production is derived from single-use plastics, with 98% of single-use plastics being derived from fossil fuels,"" said Williams.

These fossil fuels, including gas, oil, and coal, provide the raw materials for petrochemicals that serve as the building blocks for plastic manufacturing, said Williams.

The environmental consequences are significant, said Williams. The recycling reality is that less than 10% of globally-produced plastic is ever recycled. Since single-use plastic waste like straws, shopping bags, takeout containers, and water bottles can persist in the environment for decades, it’s estimated that 80%of all plastic ever manufactured still pollutes the planet. That is an estimated 8 billion metric tons of plastic waste.

What are microplastics?

This massive accumulation of plastic waste creates the foundation for microplastic contamination. Microplastics are tiny plastic fragments smaller than 5 millimeters, essentially invisible to the naked eye. They come from two main sources: intentionally-manufactured particles like microbeads used in cosmetics and biomedical products, and the breakdown of larger plastic items through normal wear and environmental exposure.

""There are broadly two families of plastics from which microplastics are derived,"" said Williams. ""Thermoplastics, which can be melted and reformed repeatedly, and thermosets, like epoxy resins and polyurethane, which undergo permanent chemical changes when heated.""

These particles don't just disappear, they persist in the environment and accumulate everywhere, creating what Williams describes as ""environmental ubiquity and persistence.”

“No geographic area on Earth is free from microplastic pollution, to include their presence in remote and pristine environments, including both the Arctic and Antarctic, sea ice, the deepest oceanic trenches, and remote mountains,"" said Williams.

How are service members exposed?

Everyone faces daily microplastic exposure through food, water, and air. However, military personnel encounter additional risks that civilians typically don't face.

Deployment-specific risks - During deployments, service members often rely heavily on bottled water and packaged meals.

Toxic elements in water bottles can contaminate their surroundings if the bottles are exposed to high temperatures and UV/sunlight, said Williams.

Meals Ready to Eat, or MREs, present another concern, said Williams. These meals are packaged in plastic that also may be exposed to heat and sunlight, potentially increasing contamination levels.

Equipment and uniform exposure - Modern military uniforms have transitioned from being made of 100% cotton to synthetic materials, said Williams. These include specialized nylons designed for durability and protection.

""When worn under conditions of high heat and direct sunlight, together with intense physical activity, there is the combined risk of microplastic emissions to the breathing zone and skin contact,"" said Williams.

Military equipment also increasingly relies on plastic composite materials for weight reduction and performance enhancement, creating additional exposure pathways during normal use, said Williams.

Environmental factors - Military operations expose service members to unique contamination sources. Burn pits, commonly used for waste disposal in forward operating bases, serve as significant sources of microplastic emissions.

""Burn pits can be a source of microplastic emissions and exposure, since plastic is often an additive to those burn pits,"" said Williams.

Dust storms in operational areas may carry microplastic particles, creating inhalation risks during missions, said Williams.

Health implications for service members

Numerous studies have revealed concerning health consequences from microplastic exposure.

""It’s critically important to emphasize that the plastics crisis is more than an environmental problem and has rapidly emerged as a serious and deeply worsening threat to human and environmental health on a global scale,” said Williams. “Microplastics have been reported in human organs, tissues, body fluids including peripheral blood, and in the liver, kidney, heart, lungs, brain, spleen, colon, and reproductive organs. This widespread presence suggests these particles can cross critical biological barriers, including the blood-brain barrier.”

The health threats come from both the physical particles and their chemical composition, said Williams. More than 16,000 chemicals are used in plastic manufacturing, of which 4,200 are chemicals of concern, including substances that may affect hormones, cognitive function, and long-term health.

Health risks

Due to their small size, microplastics ""can reach the conducting airways and far into the lung where they can migrate to the peripheral blood system,” said Williams.

Particularly alarming for service members are studies showing that microplastics were present in 99% of post-mortem lung tissue autopsies. They have also been found in other major organs including brain tissue, meaning that nanoplastics traverse the blood-brain barrier, said Williams.

Microplastic exposure contributes to increased risks of chronic health conditions and diseases, including cancer, obesity, diabetes, and cardiovascular disease, said Williams.

Reducing risk

While complete avoidance is impossible given operational requirements, service members can take targeted actions to reduce exposure risks, said Williams.

Dust and vacuum regularly. Removing excess dust from your home can help cut down on the amount of microplastic fibers in the dust you could be breathing or otherwise consuming.

Avoid drinking from disposable plastic water bottles. If you have no choice, try to keep them out of the sun, in a cool, dry environment. Disposable plastic water bottles degrade very easily in response to temperature change or friction.

Filter your water. Due to the widespread use and pollution of plastic, water can sometimes contain microplastic particles. Home water filters can be effective at reducing many contaminants, including microplastics. Advanced filtration and reverse osmosis kits are readily available.

Avoid plastic cutting boards. There are plenty of alternatives to use, like wood, glass, and steel.

Microwave your food in glass containers, rather than plastic or takeaway containers, which can release millions of microplastic particles into your food.

The bigger picture

While microplastic contamination is a growing concern, service members already successfully manage numerous health challenges. This issue requires awareness and simple preventive steps rather than major life changes.

""Due to the small size of microplastics, avoiding exposure completely is unrealistic,"" said Williams. ""However, there are options to reduce the numbers of particles that can access our body each day.""

The key is incorporating protective habits into daily routines, much like other health and safety practices many service members already follow. Understanding the global scale of plastic production and waste helps explain why this contamination is so widespread, but individual actions can still make a meaningful difference in protecting health.

Washington, D.C. – Today, U.S. Senator Kirsten Gillibrand, a member of the Senate Armed Services Committee, announced that several of her provisions were included in the National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA) for Fiscal Year 2026.

“This year’s NDAA is a win for service members, New Yorkers, and all Americans,” said Senator Gillibrand. “I was proud to fight for and secure key provisions in the final bill, including a significant pay raise for troops, over $240 million in authorizations for military installations and activities in New York, and measures to strengthen our defense against cyber threats, biological threats, and unmanned aerial systems (UAS). Protecting our troops and our national security is of the utmost importance, and I am glad to see Democrats and Republicans work together to pass this vital legislation.”

A list of Senator Gillibrand’s priorities included in the NDAA and the Senate Report include:

Personnel:

Increases service members’ pay by 3.8%.

Protects access to sexual assault medical forensic examinations by requiring the Secretary of Defense to authorize military medical treatment facilities to provide sexual assault medical forensic examinations to all victims, not just victims who are eligible for military health care.

Bolsters OBGYN care at Fort Drum by directing a briefing on the adequacy and sufficiency of OBGYN care for TRICARE beneficiaries in the installation’s vicinity.

Protects service members’ brain health by supporting blast exposure monitoring within Special Operations Command.

Helps victims of anomalous health incidents by encouraging the Department of Defense (DOD) to provide the cross-functional team addressing anomalous health incidents (AHIs) with adequate resources to continue its efforts, particularly treatment of those affected by AHIs, and by ensuring timely compensation under the Helping American Victims Afflicted by Neurological Attacks (HAVANA) Act of 2021.

New York Priorities:

Senator Gillibrand secured over $240 million in authorizations for New York institutions in the NDAA, including:

$90 million for the 42nd Infantry Division Headquarters Readiness Center, which when funded will also clear the way for separate investments and construction at Watervliet Arsenal.

$54 million for the Combined Operations Airfield Facility at Niagara Falls Air Reserve Station

$31 million for the Fort Hamilton Child Development Center

$29 million for the Watervliet Arsenal Electrical Switching Station

$20 million for the planning and design of future construction projects at Fort Drum, including:

$9.5 million for Fort Drum aircraft maintenance hangar addition

$8.3 million for Fort Drum Operational Readiness Training Center barracks design

$2.5 million for Fort Drum Range 41c, Automated Record Fire Plus range design

$5 million for short-pulsed lasers intended to defeat hypersonic missiles and other potential threats. This research is carried out by the University of Rochester.

$5 million to expand the regional presence and outreach of the Defense Innovation Unit, which works to rapidly integrate commercial technologies into the DOD.

$5 million for an Agile, Assured, and Autonomous Battle Management Network and Readiness Accelerator (3A-BMN) at Rome Lab

$5 million for biotechnology manufacturing

Unidentified anomalous phenomena (UAP) and unmanned aerial systems (UAS):

Expands DOD’s authority to counter unmanned aerial systems (UAS) by allowing the Secretary of Defense to designate DOD installations as critical to national security and therefore covered assets for the purposes of counter-UAS (cUAS) actions; allowing the use of contractors for cUAS activities; and improving information sharing between DOD and other agencies relevant to cUAS activities.

Expands domestic cUAS authorities by allowing DHS and DOJ to provide training to state, local, Tribal, or territorial law enforcement or correctional agencies to engage in cUAS detection and mitigation to protect critical infrastructure and mass gatherings.

Strengthens UAP oversight by requiring the All-domain Anomaly Resolution Office (AARO) to brief Congress on UAP intercepts by NORTHCOM and NORAD and by requiring AARO to account for security classification guides that apply to UAP and authorizing a consolidated security classification matrix for UAP.

Cyber:

Protects undersea cables by requiring a report on the strategy, challenges, and capability gaps facing DOD in protecting undersea cables from physical and cybersecurity threats.

Bolsters cyber capabilities by requiring the Secretary of Defense to conduct one or more tabletop exercises to evaluate concepts for the future employment of cyber capabilities.

Biosecurity:

This year’s NDAA includes multiple provisions to strengthen America’s defense against biological threats, including:

Increasing interagency coordination to strengthen biodefense by directing the Defense Threat Reduction Agency to coordinate with other agencies and departments to clarify roles and responsibilities for building out biodefense capacity.

Supporting research and development of bioindustrial manufacturing processes by expanding DOD’s ability to support these activities at bioindustrial manufacturing facilities.

Giving the Secretary of Defense the authority to establish a program to support the expansion of the domestic capacity for bioindustrial manufacturing at a commercial level through awards to entities for establishing, upgrading, and retooling bioindustrial manufacturing facilities.

International Partnerships:

$500 million for Israeli Missile Defense Cooperative Programs such as Iron Dome, David’s Sling, and Arrow.

The Senate on Wednesday passed a $901 billion defense policy bill authorizing a 3.8% pay raise for troops while forcing more transparency from the Pentagon and putting limits on efforts to pull the U.S. military from Europe and South Korea.

The 77-20 vote sends the annual bill, known as the National Defense Authorization Act, to President Donald Trump for his signature. The legislation authorizes $8 billion above the Trump administration’s request for national security spending and still needs to be funded by a defense appropriations bill.

Lawmakers used the legislation to push back against Trump’s moves to disengage from Europe, notably authorizing $400 million for each of the next two years for a Ukraine security assistance program the administration did not want to continue.

The bill also curbs the administration’s ability to reduce the number of troops in Europe below 76,000 or to give up U.S. command of NATO’s top officer position in Europe unless Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth certifies to Congress that such actions aligned with national security interests and were made with the consultation of NATO allies.

Similar restrictions are in place for pulling back the U.S. military presence on the Korean Peninsula below 28,500 troops.

“To remain a force for peace and stability in these areas, we must have effective force levels, and this legislation provides for that,” said Sen. Jack Reed, of Rhode Island, the top Democrat on the Senate Armed Services Committee.

The provisions reflect bipartisan backlash to the Pentagon’s recent decision to bring home about 700 troops deployed in Germany, Romania and Poland. Lawmakers have also expressed concern that Trump could draw down the U.S. military presence in South Korea, which he has said should pay more to host American troops.

The legislation also reflected frustration on Capitol Hill with the way the Pentagon communicates with lawmakers, particularly regarding the strikes on alleged drug boats in the Caribbean and eastern Pacific that have killed nearly 100 people since September. Hegseth said Tuesday that the Pentagon will not publicly release the full, unedited video of a divisive follow-up strike on a vessel on Sept. 2, but a provision in the bill withholds 25% of his travel budget until he turns over the orders behind the boat bombing campaign as well as unedited videos of the strikes to the Armed Services Committees.

“This NDAA compels the secretary of defense to follow the law and submit to Congress a number of reports that he has deliberately withheld,” said Reed, adding that the oversight provisions are a “ratification of our constitutional duties to raise an army, to supervise an army, and to ensure that the laws of the United States are followed scrupulously.”

Congress in the legislation is also asserting its authority to declare war by repealing two decades-old authorizations for the use of military force in the Gulf War in 1991 and the Iraq War in 2002. The White House has supported the repeals — a 2001 post 9/11 authorization continues to underpin nearly all U.S. counterterrorism operations around the world.

Service members will see a 3.8% pay bump under the legislation, as requested by the Trump administration. The bill also increases the family separation allowance for deployed service members from $250 to $300 and authorizes more than $1.5 billion in new construction of barracks, dormitories, housing and childcare centers.

The legislation also authorizes $26 billion in shipbuilding funding, $38 billion for aircraft and $25 billion to ramp up production of munitions.

A core focus of the bill is speeding up and reforming the way the Pentagon purchases weapons and supplies. Sen. Roger Wicker, of Mississippi, the Republican chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee, said the bill delivers the most sweeping upgrades to the Pentagon’s business practices in 60 years.

Senate Majority Leader John Thune, R-S.D., said the legislation “takes dozens of burdensome rules and laws off the books, streamlines the buying and innovations processes and ensures more American businesses will be able to contribute to America’s arsenal.”

The passage of the bill marks the end of monthslong negotiations between the House and Senate. The final version of the bill stripped out most of the conservative social policy mandates the House had passed but retained provisions banning diversity programs at the Pentagon as well as transgender athletes in women’s sports at the military academies.

Also left out of the bill were provisions that would have provided Tricare coverage of in vitro fertilization for military families and reversed Hegseth’s decision to undo a Congress-directed effort to change the names of Army bases that had honored Confederate leaders.

House Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., intervened for a second year in a row to remove the IVF measure, which had been supported by both chambers. Johnson and other conservatives have expressed concern that the IVF process involves destroying embryos, which they view as people.

Bipartisan objections remained Wednesday over a provision kept from the House that would allow military aircraft to get a waiver to fly through Washington airspace without using location-transmitting technology, as was the case when an Army helicopter collided with an airliner on Jan. 29.

The Senate later on Wednesday passed separate legislation to nullify that provision of the defense bill, requiring military aircraft to broadcast their locations when flying near busy airports — with limited exceptions. It is unclear when the House will take up the measure.",https://www.legion.org/assets/dist/images/favicons/favicon-32x32.png,N,0.0,2025-12-18 11:56:25.915230

Further, the amendment directs DHA to report back to the House and Senate on its progress by March 31, 2026.

The six clinics that will be reopened include those seeing 400 or more patients per month.

The final provision also calls on the Defense Health Agency (DHA) to develop a plan to reopen closed clinics and to explore the feasibility of putting doctors of chiropractic stationed at military facilities in the federal General Schedule (GS) system. Further, the amendment directs DHA to report back to the House and Senate on its progress by March 31, 2026.

The move to restore chiropractic services is consistent with the DHA’s ongoing concern over the use of opioids by active-duty members of the military and calls to make non-addictive alternatives for pain management more readily available to military personnel. The final language was first adopted in September as an amendment by Rep. Greg Steube (R-Fla.) to the House version of the bill. It reflects upon the Floyd D. Spence National Defense Authorization Act (Public Law 106-398), which in 2001 established the original chiropractic benefit in the Department of Defense healthcare system.

“We thank Rep. Steube for his foresight to tackle this issue, and we also acknowledge House and Senate negotiators who kept the bulk of his amendment in the final package,” said John Falardeau, American Chiropractic Association (ACA) senior vice president of public policy and advocacy.

The Steube amendment was drafted in response to chiropractic clinic closures over the past year caused by contracts with participating chiropractors being allowed to lapse, even though surveys indicate chiropractic services are highly valued at U.S. military facilities. Reports show that these clinics provide proven, cost-effective care to hundreds of patients monthly, offering a range of non-drug services to address painful musculoskeletal conditions commonly experienced by members of the military, enabling them to return to service. The results of a four-year clinical trial conducted at several military sites—the largest chiropractic clinical trial on record—provided further evidence that chiropractic care, when added to usual medical care, resulted in moderate short-term improvements in low back pain intensity in active-duty personnel.

The Fiscal Year 2026 National Defense Department Authorization Act now heads to the president’s desk for his signature. ACA will continue to work with Congress to ensure all military clinics that were recently closed reopen and to expand access at additional bases across the country and overseas.

Bill Includes A Pay Raise for Service Members and Authorizes Over $240 Million for New York Projects

Today, U.S. Senator Kirsten Gillibrand, a member of the Senate Armed Services Committee, announced that several of her provisions were included in the National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA) for Fiscal Year 2026.

“This year’s NDAA is a win for service members, New Yorkers, and all Americans,” said Senator Gillibrand.“I was proud to fight for and secure key provisions in the final bill, including a significant pay raise for troops, over $240 million in authorizations for military installations and activities in New York, and measures to strengthen our defense against cyber threats, biological threats, and unmanned aerial systems (UAS). Protecting our troops and our national security is of the utmost importance, and I am glad to see Democrats and Republicans work together to pass this vital legislation.”

A list of Senator Gillibrand’s priorities included in the NDAA and the Senate Report include:

Personnel:

Increases service members’ pay by 3.8%.

Protects access to sexual assault medical forensic examinations by requiring the Secretary of Defense to authorize military medical treatment facilities to provide sexual assault medical forensic examinations to all victims, not just victims who are eligible for military health care.

Bolsters OBGYN care at Fort Drum by directing a briefing on the adequacy and sufficiency of OBGYN care for TRICARE beneficiaries in the installation’s vicinity.

Protects service members’ brain health by supporting blast exposure monitoring within Special Operations Command.

Helps victims of anomalous health incidents by encouraging the Department of Defense (DOD) to provide the cross-functional team addressing anomalous health incidents (AHIs) with adequate resources to continue its efforts, particularly treatment of those affected by AHIs, and by ensuring timely compensation under the Helping American Victims Afflicted by Neurological Attacks (HAVANA) Act of 2021.

New York Priorities:

Senator Gillibrand secured over $240 million in authorizations for New York institutions in the NDAA, including:

$90 million for the 42nd Infantry Division Headquarters Readiness Center, which when funded will also clear the way for separate investments and construction at Watervliet Arsenal.

$54 million for the Combined Operations Airfield Facility at Niagara Falls Air Reserve Station

$31 million for the Fort Hamilton Child Development Center

$29 million for the Watervliet Arsenal Electrical Switching Station

$20 million for the planning and design of future construction projects at Fort Drum, including:

$9.5 million for Fort Drum aircraft maintenance hangar addition

$8.3 million for Fort Drum Operational Readiness Training Center barracks design

$2.5 million for Fort Drum Range 41c, Automated Record Fire Plus range design

$5 million for short-pulsed lasers intended to defeat hypersonic missiles and other potential threats. This research is carried out by the University of Rochester.

$5 million to expand the regional presence and outreach of the Defense Innovation Unit, which works to rapidly integrate commercial technologies into the DOD.

$5 million for an Agile, Assured, and Autonomous Battle Management Network and Readiness Accelerator (3A-BMN) at Rome Lab

$5 million for biotechnology manufacturing

Unidentified anomalous phenomena (UAP) and unmanned aerial systems (UAS):

Expands DOD’s authority to counter unmanned aerial systems (UAS) by allowing the Secretary of Defense to designate DOD installations as critical to national security and therefore covered assets for the purposes of counter-UAS (cUAS) actions; allowing the use of contractors for cUAS activities; and improving information sharing between DOD and other agencies relevant to cUAS activities.

Expands domestic cUAS authorities by allowing DHS and DOJ to provide training to state, local, Tribal, or territorial law enforcement or correctional agencies to engage in cUAS detection and mitigation to protect critical infrastructure and mass gatherings.

Strengthens UAP oversight by requiring the All-domain Anomaly Resolution Office (AARO)to brief Congresson UAP intercepts by NORTHCOM and NORAD and by requiring AARO to account for security classification guides that apply to UAP and authorizing a consolidated security classification matrix for UAP.

Cyber:

Protects undersea cables by requiring a report on the strategy, challenges, and capability gaps facing DOD in protecting undersea cables from physical and cybersecurity threats.

Bolsters cyber capabilities by requiring the Secretary of Defense to conduct one or more tabletop exercises to evaluate concepts for the future employment of cyber capabilities.

Biosecurity:

This year’s NDAA includes multiple provisions to strengthen America’s defense against biological threats, including:

Increasing interagency coordination to strengthen biodefense by directing the Defense Threat Reduction Agency to coordinate with other agencies and departments to clarify roles and responsibilities for building out biodefense capacity.

Supporting research and development of bioindustrial manufacturing processes by expanding DOD’s ability to support these activities at bioindustrial manufacturing facilities.

Giving the Secretary of Defense the authority to establish a program to support the expansion of the domestic capacity for bioindustrial manufacturing at a commercial level through awards to entities for establishing, upgrading, and retooling bioindustrial manufacturing facilities.

International Partnerships:

$500 million for Israeli Missile Defense Cooperative Programs such as Iron Dome, David’s Sling, and Arrow.

Here are some of the best ways to reduce your home insurance costs, based on advice from Redditors:

Increase Your Deductible

One of the most effective ways to lower your premium is by increasing your deductible. This means you'll pay more out-of-pocket if you need to file a claim, but your monthly or annual premium will be lower.

""Increase your deductible""

""The most impactful way to reduce your premium is to raise your deductible.""

Bundle Insurance Policies

Many insurance companies offer discounts if you bundle your home and auto insurance policies. This can significantly reduce your overall insurance costs.

""Auto/Home bundling discount is the largest discount on most home policies so if you don't currently have your auto(s) and home with the same carrier, look into it.""

""I bundle home, car, and umbrella through AllState. They give an excellent deal.""

Shop Around Regularly

Insurance premiums can vary widely between companies, so it's worth shopping around for quotes regularly. Consider using a local independent broker who can compare multiple options for you.

""We’ll make it easy for you: call a local independent broker/agent to shop your policy.""

""Find a good broker. I use a small local broker and they know how to find good rates.""

Improve Home Security

Installing security systems, smoke detectors, and other protective devices can earn you discounts on your premium.

""Sometimes getting a monitored alarm system will qualify you for a protective device discount.""

Update Your Home

Making improvements to your home, such as replacing an old roof, can also reduce your insurance costs.

""Year of construction and/or age of roof are big premium factors in today's market. The newer, the better your premium will be.""

""I spent $10,000 on a new roof-the insurance company lowered my premium $180.00.""

Review Your Coverage

Ensure you are not over-insured for personal property or loss of use if you can afford to cover these costs out-of-pocket.

""Reducing personal property insurance or loss of use insurance have a big impact on the premium?""

Consider a Trust

If you have significant assets, a living trust can help protect your home from potential medical bills and ensure it passes to your heirs.

""Generally, a living trust would be a good vehicle, but ya need to do some research and maybe get an attorney consultation.""

Evaluate Your Need for Additional Coverage

Determine if you truly need additional coverage like umbrella policies or flood insurance, especially if you live in a low-risk area.

""You don’t need umbrella insurance. Get it when you’re more financially able and have more to lose.""

Housing

Fort Bragg Garrison Commander, Col. Chad Mixon, said housing repairs are underway and that a refinancing plan will help bring 400 to 500 homes back online.

“Think of all that money they can reinvest in some of our other issues around housing, like playgrounds and potholes,” said Mixon.

Roads

Director of Fort Bragg Department of Public Works, Jeff Williamson, announced that King Road and Manchester Road are now complete and open. The roads have been recently expanded and repaved.

Child Care: Construction has started on a new child development center near Irwin Intermediate School.

“That’s for a mega CDC one of the first in the Army where it will house 338 children,” said Mixon.

There are 17 CDCs at Fort Bragg with a long wait list. The mega CDC will help alleviate that list.

Dining

A new campus-style dining facility is also in the works. This is also a first at Fort Bragg and the Army.

“It’s really like a restaurant,” explained Mixon. “There’s going to be all kind of grab-and-go options in there.”

Safety

Speeding continues to be a problem, stated Director of Fort Bragg Department of Emergency Services, Col. Craig Giancaterino.

“The speed abatement policy is anything over 15 miles per hour, you will lose your driving privileges on post for 30 days,” he said.

Giancaterino added that more than 7,000 citations have been issued.

“We still see speeding in school zones, All-American Freeway, I295, Rock Merritt Road, and Gruber Road,” he said.

Health

Womack Army Medical Center is open for enrollment to TRICARE Prime and TRICARE for Life beneficiaries.

“We are trying to re-attract care with our 65 and older population,” said Womack Army Medical Center Commander, Col. Stephanie Mont, “We’re also open for those TRICARE for Life beneficiaries.”

Neighborhood Mayors

Two new volunteer neighborhood mayors were also appointed. Sarah Niles representing Casablanca/Anzio Acres and Megan Giancaterino representing Normandy/Bastogne Gables.

“With these latest two additions, we now have six of our 11 neighborhoods represented,” said Fort Bragg Housing Manager, Steve Wykel.

Five Mayor openings are still available:

• Hammond Hills

• Linden Oaks (Lodge)

• Randolph Point

• Ste Mere Eglise

• Pope AAF

DMV at Fort Bragg

NC Division of Motor Vehicles has been approved to move back on the installation. Planning and coordination are still in the works, but a kiosk will be located at the Soldier Support Center followed by a DMV representative to support the readiness for Service Members and their Families.

Fort Bragg Garrison Command Sgt. Maj. Daniel Scott encourages the Fort Bragg community to continue to monitor the Fort Bragg social media pages and download the My Army Post App (MAPA) for updates and announcements.

The next Community Action Council meetings at the Iron Mike Conference Center are scheduled:

• Feb. 18, 2026

• May 20, 2026

• Aug. 19, 2026

CAC meetings are held from 9:30-11 a.m. and are open to the entire community.

,,2025-12-18 01:29:54+00:00,DHA.mil - The Official Website of The Defense Health Agency,From simulation to solution: Defense Health Agency team advances warfighter readiness with AI,Not Available,,,,,https://dha.mil/News/2025/12/17/17/46/From-simulation-to-solution,"A team from the Defense Health Agency Chief Data and Analytics Office turned the Defense Technologies “Hackathon” into a major step forward for mission and medical readiness.
The team took “synthetic data similar to what we see in MHS GENESIS and combined it with readiness policies,” he said.
“As the agency’s leader for analytics and AI, participating in this event provides exposure to emerging technologies,” Caban said.
“This experience allowed us to test readiness-focused use cases, transforming how we approach medical readiness solutions within the DHA,” she said.
The vital work of Team MEDAL demonstrated agility, innovation, and enhanced productivity for military medical readiness, Caban said.","A team from the Defense Health Agency Chief Data and Analytics Office turned the Defense Technologies “Hackathon” into a major step forward for mission and medical readiness.

As part of the National Defense Industrial Association’s Emerging Technologies for Defense Conference & Exhibition, held in Washington, D.C., Aug. 25-29, the team competed in a weeklong competition alongside 50 other teams from government, private industry, and academia. The DHA CDAO team finished second overall for what the judging panel of military technology leaders called an “impactful and innovative readiness solution.”

Members of Team MEDAL — Medical Evaluation for Defense Airmen’s Readiness — who represented DHA CDAO included Barinderjeet Dhillon, operations research analyst; Chris Kittrell, branch chief; and Junayd Park, functional lead for application prototyping and integration.

Dr. Jesus Caban, DHA’s chief data and analytics officer, said the team participated in the event to gain valuable experience in a competitive environment, solving real-world issues to enhance operational readiness.

The team took “synthetic data similar to what we see in MHS GENESIS and combined it with readiness policies,” he said. “They then spent three to four days developing a software application to show the value of leveraging DHA data and AI (artificial intelligence) to better understand and support medical readiness.”

For Caban, the event offered more than a trophy: He said it served as proof for how data and AI can remove barriers that limit the force’s response speed.

“As the agency’s leader for analytics and AI, participating in this event provides exposure to emerging technologies,” Caban said. “It also highlights the incredible talent we have within the agency that we can leverage to apply innovative solutions in support of warfighter readiness.”

Leveraging AI to increase workflow productivity and efficiency

Team MEDAL took on the challenge of automating aeromedical waiver generation for U.S. Air Force pilots. The scenario was a “known constraint on pilot availability,” said Park. They developed a prototype to “streamline aeromedical waiver processing and readiness,” directly addressing issues of medically clearing pilots in an efficient and timely manner, Park said.

Aeromedical waivers can be a critical piece of the readiness puzzle. Before pilots can fly after a disqualifying injury, illness, or new diagnosis, providers must draft an aeromedical waiver, which reviews the airman’s medical history, current condition, and specific occupational requirements. This process can be unnecessarily time-consuming for military providers.

“Leveraging AI capabilities, we were able to demonstrate a significant decrease in the time that a doctor would take to process aeromedical waivers,” said Kittrell, referring to a process that commonly ranges anywhere between 30 minutes and multiple days. “Our solution demonstrated the ability to get this down to less than 30 seconds.”

The entire prototype development took less than 16 hours of coding during the hackathon, according to Park. “We used a coding platform to stand up the front end, coupled with an MHS GENESIS-compatible backend that we integrated using AI tools.”

Creating real-world streamlining solutions

Team MEDAL’s success demonstrated DHA’s capability to leverage AI and innovative approaches to improve efficiency, enhance clinical decision-making, and ultimately increase warfighter readiness, according to Dhillon.

“This experience allowed us to test readiness-focused use cases, transforming how we approach medical readiness solutions within the DHA,” she said. “We’re excited to continue piloting AI solutions in support of the agency’s mission.”

Since the hackathon, the team has continued refining the application using an approved application programming interface and has explored how similar tools could enhance other enterprise-wide initiatives. This example of integrating human and technology operations also aligns to DHA’s FY26 Mission Focused Directive as a combat support agency.

The vital work of Team MEDAL demonstrated agility, innovation, and enhanced productivity for military medical readiness, Caban said.

“I want to recognize and congratulate the team on their outstanding work and their continued support as we move quickly to mature our data and analytics capabilities in support of the readiness mission,” he added. “They are truly agents of change.”",https://dha.mil/-/media/Project/Images/News-Images/9448437.jpg,N,1.0,2025-12-17 23:56:41.310581

The bill authorizes a record $900 billion in military spending — $8 billion more than initially requested in President Donald Trump’s budget.
We need accountability — not just handouts to Trump.” The National Defense Authorization Bill (NDAA) establishes priorities and programs, but does not actually provide budget authority or spending for those programs.
The House first passed a version of the bill on September 10, and the Senate passed its own version on October 9.
According to a 2024 survey, half of military service members say their compensation is a top stressor, followed closely by housing concerns.","The Senate voted 77-20 to pass the final version of the 2026 defense bill on Wednesday. The bill authorizes a record $900 billion in military spending — $8 billion more than initially requested in President Donald Trump’s budget.

“This year’s National Defense Authorization Act helps advance President Trump and Republicans’ Peace Through Strength Agenda by codifying 15 of President Trump’s executive orders, ending woke ideology at the Pentagon, securing the border, revitalizing the defense industrial base, and restoring the warrior ethos,” House Speaker Mike Johnson, a Republican, said in a statement.

Some Democrats, however, felt that the bill fell short and focused on the wrong priorities.

“Trump and [Defense Secretary Pete] Hegseth are deploying troops to our streets, carrying out extrajudicial killings, and undermining our military readiness,” Democratic Rep. John Garamendi of California, a senior Armed Services Committee member, said on social media. “Congress must reassert its oversight. We need accountability — not just handouts to Trump.”

The National Defense Authorization Bill (NDAA) establishes priorities and programs, but does not actually provide budget authority or spending for those programs. To provide funding, Congress is supposed to pass 12 appropriations acts each year, including one for the Department of Defense.

The NDAA has passed year after year for more than six decades, largely because deeply partisan provisions have been kept out. However, reflecting the state of politics, culture war provisions — including diversity, equity and inclusion programs, critical race theory, abortion-related travel, drag queen shows and COVID vaccine and mask mandates — were heatedly debated on the House and Senate floors this year. Compromises shaped different versions of the bill for months. The House first passed a version of the bill on September 10, and the Senate passed its own version on October 9. Then, legislators considered hundreds of amendments and worked to reconcile any differences between the two versions. The House passed its final, compromise version on December 10, followed by the Senate a week later. The 3,086-page bill now awaits the president’s signature.

The NDAA outlines the military’s values and strategic priorities, which often signal the administration’s broader vision about what might be coming to other federal departments and civilian life. Here are some of its notable provisions:

Reproductive health care

What was included in the final bill:

TRICARE, the health care program for active-duty and retired members of the Armed Services, will only cover fertility services, including in vitro fertilization (IVF), for service members whose infertility was caused by “a serious or severe illness or injury while on active duty.”

What was removed from the text:

A provision that would have required TRICARE coverage of fertility services, including IVF, for all service members and their families was removed in final negotiations — despite passing with bipartisan support in both the House and Senate versions of the bill.

Democratic Rep. Sara Jacobs of California, who championed the IVF provision in the House, pointed out that military families face higher rates of infertility than the average population and need extra support overall for family building.

“I think it’s really important because of the nature of their jobs: demanding schedules, long deployments, frequent relocations, the physical demands of training, exposure to hazardous environments, being separated from their partner,” Jacobs said.

When Jacobs spoke on the House floor in the final hours of debate, she told the story of an Army wife who tried nine rounds of intrauterine insemination and has been told her husband’s infertility is due to his service. Still, TRICARE wouldn’t cover IVF, so she’s considering getting a divorce so she can find other coverage and give them another opportunity at growing their family.

“What I hear from so many military families is that they’re basically left with three choices,” Jacobs said. “Either pay tens of thousands of dollars out of pocket for a chance to have a family, leave the military to find a job in the private sector that will cover it or forgo a family altogether.

Jacobs said she was especially disappointed because she and other Democrats were hopeful the provision would make it this year, given Trump’s campaign promises to make IVF more accessible for everyone.

Diversity, equity and inclusion

What was included in the final bill:

Each of the five military branches will be required to restore service-level women’s initiative teams, some of which were disbanded when Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth called for the end of diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI) initiatives in the Pentagon. These teams will include servicewomen from different ranks, backgrounds and occupations, and they will be tasked with identifying and addressing issues that hinder women’s service. They will also support recruiting and retention and recommend policy changes that support the needs of women in the military.

Democratic Rep. Chrissy Houlahan of Pennsylvania, who introduced the provision, said she was grateful to find bipartisan support.

“These protections strengthen our force, our families, and our national security, and are vital under an Administration working to sideline women and erase their contributions,” Houlahan said in a statement.

The secretary of defense is prohibited from maintaining a DEI office, employing a chief diversity officer, maintaining an employee resource group or affinity group, developing any strategic plans or reports related to DEI and developing any training courses related to DEI, critical race theory or intersectionality.

Service academies are now prohibited from considering race, sex, color, ethnicity, national origin or religion in admissions decisions.

What was removed from the text:

The final version repealed existing DEI mandates, removing statutory requirements for diversity initiatives and other efforts to promote equal opportunity. The move is a reflection of Hegseth’s leadership and vision to shift the military’s culture away from what he called “woke garbage” to a “warrior ethos.”

LGBTQ+ care and participation

What was included in the final bill:

Transgender women enrolled at U.S. service academies can no longer participate in athletic programs designated for women.

What was removed from the text:

The final version did not include many anti-LGBTQ+ provisions that were added in early versions, like a ban on Defense Department funding for gender-affirming surgeries, which had passed in previous versions of both the House and Senate bills. It also dropped a provision that would have required all people to use single-sex facilities, including restrooms, locker rooms and changing rooms, at military installations based on their “reproductive system.”

“While we’re grateful that most anti-LGBTQI+ provisions were removed, the GOP kept one anti-trans provision in the final bill — and that’s one too many,” the Congressional Equality Caucus, a House caucus committed to advocating for LGBTQ+ rights, said in a statement. “We’re committed to repealing it.”

Previous versions of the bill also had provisions that said TRICARE would not cover or furnish “gender-related medical treatment,” which includes puberty blockers, hormone therapy and surgeries for transgender people. Some versions also expanded the existing ban on covering gender dysphoria treatments for children by also banning mental health care. These provisions are not found in the final version. TRICARE currently only covers hormone therapy and psychological counseling for gender dysphoria. It does not cover surgery.

An earlier version also said that the secretary of defense would be prohibited from collecting information about gender identity on any form or survey — which will now only include “male” and “female” as gender options. The amendment was dropped.

An amendment included in the 2024 NDAA allowed military leaders or certain civilian leaders to approve the display of Pride flags; however, that provision has been removed.

Support for military families

What was included in the final bill:

All branches of the military will be required to set clear policies exempting service members from performance evaluations during parental leave, which they will now be allowed to take within two years of a child’s birth or adoption instead of one. In the past several years, the military made significant progress in expanding parental leave options to up to 12 weeks of paid leave for primary and secondary caregivers. The latest provision seeks to provide more consistency across the services and ensure that no one is at a disadvantage.

Republican Rep. Stephanie Bice of Oklahoma, who championed the provision, called it a “victory for parents and for the strength of our national defense.”

In an effort to improve service members’ quality of life, the bill includes a 3.8 percent pay increase across the board and reauthorizes and expands military bonuses. It also brings a 4.2 percent average increase to housing allowances. According to a 2024 survey, half of military service members say their compensation is a top stressor, followed closely by housing concerns. The rising cost of housing is outpacing the military’s housing allowances: Only 37 percent of families said their allowances covered the cost of housing.

More than $491 million is authorized for the construction of new child care centers and more than $200 million for new schools for service members’ children and dependents. Finding child care is a common struggle for military families. According to the National Military Family Association, nearly 40 percent of the more than 1 million active-duty service members have children, and 70 percent of these children are under the age of 12.

What was absent from the text:

Notably, there were no amendments in this year’s bill that explicitly addressed the high military spouse unemployment rate. In previous years, the NDAA extended the Defense Department’s authority to fill open civilian positions with qualified military spouses, help those in licensed or credentialed professions more easily work after relocating across state lines and increase reimbursement rates for spouses’ business costs. The unemployment rate among military spouses — more than 90 percent of them are women — was 20 percent or higher for the last decade, according to Pentagon survey data. This is five times the national civilian unemployment rate.

WASHINGTON - U.S. Senator Martin Heinrich (D-N.M.) welcomed final passage of the National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA) for Fiscal Year 2026 (FY26). The legislation includes major wins that Heinrich secured, including investments in New Mexico’s service members, military installations, national labs, job-creating initiatives throughout the state, and two specific Heinrich-led bills.

“This bipartisan defense bill includes important provisions to support our service members, invest in New Mexico’s military installations, strengthen our national labs, and accelerate critical environmental clean-up work in New Mexico. It also includes my legislation to ensure military families stationed at White Sands Missile Range, Holloman Air Force Base, and rural bases across the U.S. are reimbursed for medical travel under TRICARE Prime,” said Heinrich. “I’m proud that this legislation also further cements New Mexico’s leadership on emerging defense and space capabilities, includes my Downwinder Commemoration Act and International Nuclear Energy Act, and builds on important cybersecurity provisions that grew out of my work in the Bipartisan Senate AI Working Group. This bill will help make New Mexico and our country stronger and safer.”

Heinrich successfully included within the FY26 NDAA his TRICARE Travel Improvement Act to ensure active-duty service members and their families can be reimbursed when they travel for medical care. Currently, families stationed at White Sands Missile Range and Holloman Air Force Base travel nearly 100 miles to El Paso, Texas, for specialist medical care, but are denied reimbursement because they are just under the 100-mile threshold. Heinrich’s TRICARE Travel Improvement Act will ensure fairness for military families serving in remote areas by lowering the travel reimbursement threshold under TRICARE Prime from 100 miles to 75 miles for military families.

Heinrich also successfully included in the FY26 NDAA his Downwinder Commemoration Act to recognize the harm endured by New Mexico’s Downwinders following the 1945 Trinity Test — the first nuclear detonation in U.S. history. The bill directs the Department of Defense (DoD) to place commemorative monuments in publicly accessible areas at White Sands Missile Range and Holloman Air Force Base in their honor.

Both the TRICARE Travel Improvement Act and the Downwinder Commemoration Act are led by Heinrich in the Senate and U.S. Representative Gabe Vasquez (D-N.M.) in the House.

“As a member of the House Armed Services Committee, I’m fighting for New Mexico’s interests and fair share of funding in the nation’s defense bill,” said Vasquez. “With the passage of these two bipartisan bills I have led, we will finally recognize the families who have suffered in silence from the impacts of the Trinity Test and also ensure military families at White Sands and Holloman Air Force Base don’t have to pay out of pocket to access health care.”

Additionally, Heinrich successfully included the FY26 NDAA his International Nuclear Energy Act, co-led with U.S. Senators James Risch (R-Idaho), Chris Coons (D-Del.), and Mike Lee (R-Utah), to provide the federal government new tools to coordinate on nuclear energy policy with allied nations and help American energy companies thrive on the world market.

The FY26 NDAA now heads to the White House.

The NDAA sets the DOD spending levels and policies for the upcoming fiscal year and authorizes funding for the U.S. Department of Energy's programs at Sandia and Los Alamos National Laboratories, as well as the Department of Energy's environmental cleanup programs including the Waste Isolation Pilot Plant (WIPP).

Heinrich has long championed provisions that benefit New Mexico’s service members, national laboratories, and defense missions. Heinrich served as a member of the Senate Armed Services Committee from 2013 to 2020 and as Chairman of the U.S. Senate Appropriations Military Construction, Veterans Affairs, and Related Agencies Subcommittee from 2021 to 2022. He is also a member of the U.S. Senate Select Committee on Intelligence and a member of the U.S. Senate Appropriations Military Construction, Veterans Affairs, and Related Agencies Subcommittee.

During his time in Congress, Heinrich has doubled the total budgets for Sandia and Los Alamos, significantly increasing the total employees and local economic impact of both labs.

Heinrich has also delivered a total of more than $1.5 billion for military construction projects at defense installations in New Mexico over the course of his career in Congress.

FY26 Defense Authorization Bill Highlights

Military Construction

Heinrich championed a historic number of investments in our military installations in New Mexico, including:

$90 million for a new 192-bed dormitory at Cannon Air Force Base.

$79 million for a Deployment Processing Center at Cannon Air Force Base.

$83 million for a Space Rapid Capabilities Office Headquarters at Kirtland Air Force Base.

$10 million for a dormitory for the 58th Special Operations Wing on Kirtland Air Force Base.

$26 million for an Explosive Operations Building on Kirtland Air Force Base.

$38.5 million for a Power Generation and Microgrid project on White Sands Missile Range.

$4.25 million for a Soldier Performance Readiness Center for the New Mexico Army National Guard at the Sante Fe Training Center.

Artificial Intelligence and Emerging Technologies

Heinrich helped secure provisions that ensure the DoD only uses commercial AI services from companies with a reliable cybersecurity posture. AI companies that do not take appropriate steps to defend themselves in cyberspace may become the victims of supply chain attacks that compromise the trustworthiness of their products.

Pay Raise for Junior Enlisted Service Members

The FY26 NDAA authorizes a 3.8 percent pay raise for service members. This builds off of a 14.5 percent pay raise for the most junior-ranking enlisted service members, and a 4.5 percent pay raise for the rest of the force in the FY25 NDAA.

Sandia and Los Alamos National Laboratories

The FY26 NDAA authorizes $1.79 billion for LANL’s ongoing research and development programs. The funding supports personnel, equipment, and other activities at LANL.

Within the FY26 NDAA's overall $26 billion for the National Nuclear Security Administration (NNSA), Sandia National Laboratories will receive funding to support and sustain system integration, engineering, and science programs. Sandia is also receiving $40 million for their Microsystems, Engineering, Science and Applications (MESA) Photolithography Capability and $52.2 million for Combined Radiation Environments for Survivability Testing.

Additional Heinrich-led provisions include:

Directing the U.S. Department of Energy Secretary to brief Congress on recommended actions to accelerate environmental cleanup milestones with the State of New Mexico at Los Alamos National Laboratory, including interim measures to control migration of a hexavalent chromium plume and progress on the groundwater remedies for the Royal Demolition Explosive (RDX) plume in Cañon de Valle.

Directing the NNSA Administrator for Nuclear Security and Directors of Los Alamos and Sandia National Laboratories, along with leaders from other national labs, to evaluate site strategies that can aid the NNSA in making greater use of facilities in areas neighboring existing laboratory and site installations, particularly where workforce housing is less constrained.

Directing the U.S. Comptroller General to assess:

What Unexploded Ordnance remediation efforts the NNSA has completed in the vicinity of Sandia National Laboratories; and

The extent to which additional efforts are needed to ensure that all affected nearby communities have been cleared of legacy unexploded ordnance.

Authorizing nearly $300 million for environmental cleanup efforts at Sandia and Los Alamos National Laboratories.

Directing the NNSA Administrator for Nuclear Security to conduct a study of portions of Tract A-14 (Rendija Canyon) of Los Alamos National Laboratory that may be suitable for conveyance.

Waste Isolation Pilot Plant (WIPP)

The FY26 NDAA authorizes over $415 million to operate WIPP including $2 million to construct a hoisting capability project to improve facility capacity and effectiveness.

Space Force Modeling, Simulation & Analysis Hub

The FY26 NDAA authorizes $7.5 million for the ongoing establishment and deployment of a U.S. Space Force modeling and simulation hub at the Air Force Research Lab on Kirtland Air Force Base.

Readiness and Environmental Protection Integration Program

The FY26 NDAA authorizes over $182 million for the DoD’s Readiness and Environmental Protection Integration (REPI) Program. Cannon Air Force Base, Melrose Air Force Range, and White Sands Missile Range utilize the REPI to prevent encroachment and preserve their testing and training missions. The program as a whole is critical to assisting military installations and ranges as they are increasingly impacted by extreme weather, flooding, wildfires, drought, and other threats to resilience.

Advanced Simulation and Computing for Nuclear Stockpile Stewardship

The FY26 NDAA authorizes $866 million in funding for the NNSA’s advanced simulation and computing efforts in the Stockpile Stewardship Program. This program ensures continued reliability of the stockpile and allows realistic simulations on supercomputers to understand how they would behave, without requiring explosive testing.

Intelligence Authorization Act

The FY26 NDAA includes the Intelligence Authorization Act for FY26, legislation that equips U.S. intelligence agencies with the tools, resources, and personnel they need to protect the American people, while also ensuring congressional oversight over those same agencies.
