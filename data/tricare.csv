Two men who ran a New Jersey-based marketing company have been sentenced to federal prison for orchestrating a nationwide health care fraud and kickback scheme that bilked Medicare and TRICARE out of over $127 million, according to a statement released by the U.S. Department of Justice.

Eric Karlewicz, also known as “Anthony Mazza,” 46, of Rockland County, New York, was sentenced to 51 months in prison, while Nicco Romanowski, 33, of Roswell, Georgia, received an 80-month sentence.

The two were sentenced by U.S. District Judge Esther Salas in Newark federal court after pleading guilty to conspiracy to commit health care fraud and conspiracy to violate the federal Anti-Kickback Statute.

According to federal prosecutors, from mid-2017 to mid-2019, Karlewicz and Romanowski operated Empire Pain Center Holdings LLC, a marketing company that worked with doctors, telemedicine firms, and medical equipment suppliers to submit fraudulent claims for durable medical equipment (DME) such as braces for shoulders, knees, and backs.

Using aggressive call tactics, Empire employees pressured Medicare and TRICARE recipients to accept medical equipment they often didn’t need.

The company then paid kickbacks to telemedicine firms, which in turn paid doctors to sign off on the orders—frequently without consulting patients.

The prescriptions were sent to DME suppliers, who submitted claims for reimbursement and shared a portion of the proceeds with Empire.

Through these illicit arrangements, Karlewicz and Romanowski’s company received more than $63 million, while the total fraudulent claims exceeded $127 million.

Authorities said the two used proceeds from the scheme to purchase high-end luxury cars including a Ferrari, Lamborghini, Bentley, and BMW.

In addition to prison time, each defendant was sentenced to three years of supervised release and ordered to pay $127.6 million in restitution.",https://www.rlsmedia.com/sites/default/files/styles/og_image/public/field/image/article/IMG_2646.jpeg?h=8f74817f&itok=KWrmrwXA,N,0.0,2025-04-22 06:56:23.784610

They include the American Medical Specialties Board as well as the AOA Bureau of Osteopathic Specialists, and specialty boards for podiatric medicine, foot and ankle, and oral and maxillofacial surgery.
An official with the agency tells the Sun that any physician who meets its standards can work at a military facility, regardless of board certification.
“Board certification is not required for any physicians hired by the military to work within our military medical treatment facilities,” the official said.
“ABMS and AOA are inherently recognized as having unique credentials with respect to board certification,” she said.","A physicians group representing about 5 percent of America’s doctors is asking Congress to break a monopoly held by its rival — the nation’s largest medical board certification group — which it charges has gained exclusive control over military and veterans hospitals, shutting out qualified physicians with needed specialty skills.

The American Board of Physician Specialists certifies doctors in 25 fields, including familiar practices such as anesthesiology, diagnostic radiology, family practice, and obstetrics and gynecology, as well as distinct specialties like integrative medicine and pain management. The group’s CEO, Jeff Morris, says that uniquely skilled doctors are being ignored by the military because of a sweetheart arrangement with the American Board of Medical Specialties, which represents more than 900,000 doctors nationwide. He contends the deal is driving up costs, reducing innovation, and denying access to care.

“Reaching medical readiness is important,“ Mr. Morris tells the Sun. “If you have just one entity controlling that, you no longer have a difference of thought. So then what happens to innovation in medicine?”

The National Defense Authorization Act recognizes credentials from five boards. They include the American Medical Specialties Board as well as the AOA Bureau of Osteopathic Specialists, and specialty boards for podiatric medicine, foot and ankle, and oral and maxillofacial surgery. The act lists qualifications that other boards must meet to become credentialed with the military’s medical care provider, the Defense Health Agency.

An official with the agency tells the Sun that any physician who meets its standards can work at a military facility, regardless of board certification.

“Board certification is not required for any physicians hired by the military to work within our military medical treatment facilities,” the official said. “Our physicians need to have an appropriate license and applicable degree from an accredited institution, along with appropriate post-graduate training certificates for their specialty such as internship residency or fellowship, and evidence of current clinical competency, but board certifications are not required for hiring or for retention.”

While board certification is said to be optional, without it, doctors don’t get hired, Mr. Morris asserted, claiming that the military’s hiring authorities are members of the pre-eminent boards. One emergency medicine doctor with the military added that doctors can only earn the annual incentive pay bonus for certification if they are certified by a credentialed board.

“In terms of practicing in the military, it’s a pay issue because you have a pay incentive if you are board certified through an organization that is recognized by the military,” the doctor, who has been working as a reservist for more than three decades, tells the Sun. “Your board certification was not recognized unless it was through the ABMS.”

The Defense Health Agency official did not provide the number of physicians who operate without board certification or the percentage of certified physicians who are certified by the medical specialties board.

Founded by the American Medical Association in the 1930s in an effort for physicians to assert their medical expertise, the American Medical Specialties Board represents 95 percent of America’s doctors and offers certification by 24 boards in 136 subspecialties.

The organization’s associate vice president for communications, Susan C. Morris, tells the Sun that her organization had no role in determining which boards were recognized in the defense bill, “whether by name or through the standards.” She added that the defense authorization act mirrors the American Medical Association’s standards policy.

“ABMS and AOA are inherently recognized as having unique credentials with respect to board certification,” she said. “The high quality and rigor of the ABMS member boards’ certification programs lead to better care and outcomes for patients.”

Mr. Morris predicts that without recognition of other boards, lack of innovation and increasing costs will only get worse. Last month, Republicans on the House Judiciary’s antitrust subcommittee wrote several residency programs and accreditation councils asking whether hiring practices suppress doctors’ mobility and pay and contribute to doctor shortages.

The medical residency antitrust exemption passed by Congress in 2004 “has distorted the American medical residency market, undermining free market principles to the detriment of the nation’s doctors and the patients who rely on them,” wrote House Ways and Means’ antitrust subcommittee chairman, Scott Fitzgerald.

Among the letter’s recipients was the Accreditation Council of Graduate Medical Education, which was co-founded by the American Medical Specialities Board and is funded by American taxpayers to the tune of $15 billion per year.

“Now you have two entities that work together to control physicians and how medicine is taught completely,” Mr. Morris said.

Ms. Morris disputed claims that her board plays a role in the governance of the accreditation council, but acknowledged that some member boards “have programs to help educate residents about the board certification process for that specialty or subspecialty.”

The federation representing state medical licensing authorities also notes that board certification is voluntary, but “other practical considerations — such as obtaining hospital privileges — lead most physicians to obtain specialty certification.”

At least seven licensing authorities — in Alabama, Iowa, Minnesota, Oregon, Tennessee Medical, Virginia, Wyoming — give preferential treatment to candidates certified by the American Medical Specialties Board. These preferences include allowing physician candidates additional time to obtain a medical license, lowering post-graduate training requirements, and increasing the number of exam attempts a physician can take.

This preference system is just another example of how a stranglehold on board recognition lowers standards without improving care, Mr. Morris said, noting that military members, including Special Forces being deployed with a medic, are disadvantaged as a result.

“There are a lot of boards that don’t even exist yet because medicine is constantly changing,” he said. “These certifying bodies should be able to present themselves, and the Defense Health Agency looks and says, you meet the standard, you’re accepted.”",https://wp.nysun.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Ear-nose-and-throat-doctors-on-ship.jpg?w=1200&h=630&fit=fill&fm=jpg&fl=progressive,N,0.0,2025-04-22 06:56:33.737020

From service cancellations to mounting debt, they're fighting for accountability after a change from TRICARE's east to west region.

That change has left a trail of frustrations for Texas families and providers.

""There just needs to be accountability,"" said active military spouse Rebecca Brown. ""Somebody, somewhere within the 'Triwest' system knows what is going on and what needs to be fixed.""

Brown expected a smooth transition from the old company, Humana.

""It has been the exact opposite of that,"" she said. ""We have had referrals get lost, referrals not show up at all and having to reach out directly via phone call to Triwest agents to try and rectify the problem.""

Brown's daughter lives with autism. Referrals make sure she gets the treatment she needs from providers.

According to a by Mission Alpha Advocacy, 75% of TRICARE West Region families experienced disruptions after the January 1 shift.

Providers have also struggled with the transition.

""We couldn't get paid. We couldn't even get into the system,"" said Intergrated Behavior Solutions owner, Britt Sims. ""So it was weeks and weeks of trying to figure that out, and on into the end of January.. before we even talked to anybody that had any clue what was happening.""

The San Antonio clinic mainly serve children and teens with autism. They've had to make tough calls to keep the lights on.

Some have even has to drop TRICARE patients to stay afloat.

""We're four loans in. Most of us that are small providers are."" Sims said. ""It's not about it's not about money. It's not about claims. It's about services, direct services that these children with autism desperately need.""

Those loans total up to roughly $180,000 in debt to keep serving his 90% of his clients who fall under TriWest; and all at the risk of taking a hit to his practice.

""These kids are worth it. These families are worth it. So, let's keep fighting,"" he said. ""But we can't really take any more TRICARE kids.. right now, we don't know what's going to happen with that. So that's a burden for us.""

""We're at danger of approaching irreparable harm to our TRICARE provider network, and that will affect our military readiness and resilience and retention,"" said Mission Alpha Advocacy CEO Kristi Cabiao.

Advocates like Cabiao are now helping push those concerns to the desks of state and local leaders.

""They have responded, but I encourage families to keep reaching out so that it stays in the front of the minds of the congressional members,"" she said. ""Because there's a lot of noise and there's a lot of activity happening.""

""These people served our country, they've put their lives on the line in many situations,"" Brown said. ""This is just something that shouldn't have happened in the first place but -- now that it has happened — it needs to be resolved.""

We've heard from several other families facing the same problems.

We reached out to Triwest to figure out what's going on. While a representative responded, they didn't give specific answers on these issues.",https://news4sanantonio.com/resources/media2/16x9/1280/986/center/90/aca7d261-7bc7-4f2c-9a43-2ac764c6e884-e79ab8f4cb844d7e81d73088e3215310.png,N,-1.0,2025-04-22 00:56:19.094549

These include Beneficiary Counseling and Assistance Coordinators. You can find them at any military hospital or clinic.

Before you reach out to a BCAC, it’s important to first contact your regional contractor for help with TRICARE issues. Most TRICARE questions and concerns—such as those about enrollment, claims, referrals, or provider networks—can be handled directly through them. If you've already reached out to your contractor and still need help, a BCAC is your next step. They can take a deeper look at your issue and help guide you toward a resolution.

To get help, start by contacting the appropriate resource:

Questions about TRICARE eligibility or updates to a military service record: Contact your Service Personnel Component or the DMDC/DEERS Support Office (800-538-9552).

Questions about enrollment, claims, provider networks, or referrals: Contact your regional contractor first.

So, when should you get in touch with a BCAC? Read below to learn more.

What does a Beneficiary Counseling and Assistance Coordinator do?

BCACs can explain your TRICARE plan and how your benefit works. They work closely with regional contractors and claims processors to help resolve your concerns.

BCACs can address TRICARE-related questions, including:

Enrollment

Referrals and pre-authorizations

Claims processing delays

Covered services

The Military Health System Nurse Advice Line

Getting healthcare services outside the military hospital or clinic

“You may have questions or concerns about TRICARE enrollment, coverage, or costs that haven’t been resolved through traditional channels. BCACs are people you can contact, and even meet with in person,” said Calvin Keller, health systems analyst, Benefit Education, at the Defense Health Agency. “They’re committed to answering your questions and addressing your concerns.”

For example, you may have a question about your TRICARE eligibility or enrollment as shown in the Defense Enrollment Eligibility Reporting System. Maybe your record shows “No healthcare coverage plan” and you believe this is an error. After reaching out to the DMDC/DEERS Support Office, a BCAC can:

Explain the different messages you see in your DEERS record

Provide information on eligibility requirements

Guide you on how to follow up with your sponsor’s Service Personnel Component

BCACs don’t determine or fix TRICARE eligibility—but they can be a valuable resource in navigating the process.

Why reach out to a BCAC?

If you feel lost after trying to resolve issues with your regional contractor or service, there are still other TRICARE experts who can help. Consider reaching out to a BCAC. BCACs will work with you to understand your concerns and explore possible solutions.

Who can get help from a BCAC?

Do you still have questions after contacting your regional contractor? Any TRICARE beneficiary can visit or call a BCAC, even if you don’t regularly get care at a military hospital or clinic, or live far from one.

How do I find a BCAC?

You can meet with a BCAC in person by walking into their office. You don’t need an appointment. If you can’t get there in person, you can give them a call.

Each military hospital or clinic has contact information for their BCAC. Find their information online on the Find a Military Hospital or Clinic page. Or check out the Customer Service Community Directory. You can also ask the hospital staff for their office location if you’d like to meet in person.

What’s the difference between a BCAC and a patient advocate?

While both are there to support you, BCACs and patient advocates have different roles. BCACs help with TRICARE benefits. Patient advocates help with concerns or questions about healthcare services you received at a military hospital or clinic.

They can:

Explain the Patient Bill of Rights and Responsibilities and give you a copy

Explain military hospital or clinic policies, procedures, and operations

Eric Karlewicz a/k/a “Anthony Mazza,” 46, of Rockland County, New York, and Nicco Romanowski, 33, of Roswell, Georgia, were sentenced by U.S. District Judge Esther Salas in Newark federal court following their guilty pleas to Informations charging conspiracy to violate the Federal Anti-Kickback statute and conspiracy to commit health care fraud. Karlewicz was sentenced to 51 months in prison and Romanowski was sentenced to 80 months in prison.

According to documents filed in this case and statements made in court:

From in or around June 2017 through in or around May 2019, Karlewicz and Romanowski participated in a scheme with durable medical equipment (“DME”) companies, telemedicine companies, and doctors to submit false claims to health care benefit programs, including Medicare and TRICARE, based on a circular scheme of kickbacks and bribes. Karlewicz and Romanowski controlled a New Jersey-based marketing company, Empire Pain Center Holdings LLC (“Empire”), though which they and their co-conspirators identified Medicare and TRICARE beneficiaries to target. Employees of Empire called the beneficiaries to pressure them to agree to accept DME, frequently consisting of back, shoulder, and knee braces. Karlewicz and Romanowski paid Empire’s employees commissions, bonuses, and incentives to encourage them to convince as many beneficiaries as possible to accept DME, regardless of medical necessity.

Karlewicz and Romanowski, through Empire, then paid kickbacks to telemedicine companies, which in turn paid kickbacks to doctors in exchange for prescriptions for the DME. As agreed upon, the doctors signed the prescription orders regardless of medical necessity, often without ever speaking to the patient. Karlewicz and Romanowski distributed the prescriptions to DME suppliers around the country, with which Empire had additional kickback arrangements. These DME suppliers submitted claims for reimbursement to health care benefit programs including Medicare and TRICARE, and thereafter sent a portion of the proceeds to Empire as payment for the doctor’s orders generated through the conspiracy. Empire received more than $63 million from DME suppliers in exchange for the referrals.

In total, Karlewicz and Romanowski caused the submission of false and fraudulent claims to health care benefit programs totaling in excess of $127 million for DME. Using proceeds from the scheme, Karlewicz and Romanowski purchased luxury vehicles, including a Ferrari, and Lamborghini, a Bentley, and a BMW.

In addition to the prison terms, Judge Salas sentenced each defendant to three years of supervised release and ordered them to pay $127,600,000 in restitution. Karlewicz was ordered to forfeit over $63 million, and Romanowski was ordered to forfeit over $5.5 million.

United States Attorney Habba also announced that Karlewicz and Empire entered into a civil settlement agreement. As part of that civil settlement agreement, Karlewicz and Empire admitted to violating the False Claims Act and agreed to the entry of a consent judgment against them in the amount of $63.8 million.

The civil settlement agreement resolves a lawsuit filed under the whistleblower provision of the False Claims Act, which permits private parties, called relators, to file suit on behalf of the United States for false claims and share in a portion of the government’s recovery. The relator, Robert Jackson Tyler, Jr., will receive a share of the funds recovered by the United States pursuant to the False Claims Act.

United States Attorney Habba credited special agents of the FBI, under the direction of Acting Special Agent in Charge Terence G. Reilly in Newark, U.S. Department of Health and Human Services Office of Inspector General, under the direction of Special Agent in Charge Naomi Gruchacz, and U.S. Department of Defense, Office of Inspector General, Defense Criminal Investigative Service, Northeast Field Office, under the direction of Acting Special Agent in Charge Christopher Silvestro, with the investigation.

Common Questions About TRICARE Couples Rehab Coverage Is TRICARE couples rehab free?","A Complete Guide to TRICARE Treatment Options and What to Expect

When couples face the challenges of addiction or mental health issues, seeking treatment together can be an important step toward healing.

Fortunately, TRICARE, the healthcare program for military members, veterans, and their families, provides access to rehabilitation services for couples, making it easier for eligible individuals to get the help they need.

In this Couples Rehab Guide resource, we’ll break down everything you need to know about TRICARE couples rehab coverage, including the types of addiction and mental health treatment covered, how to verify coverage, and what patients can expect from the process.

What is TRICARE?

TRICARE is a health insurance program available to U.S. military service members, veterans, and their families. It offers comprehensive care services, including mental health and substance use disorder treatment, through a network of military and civilian providers.

While it provides a wide range of services, including outpatient and inpatient care, it’s important to understand how couples rehab is specifically covered under this plan.

Does TRICARE Cover Couples Rehab?

Yes, TRICARE does cover rehab services, including treatment for couples struggling with addiction or mental health disorders. The type of care available under TRICARE can vary based on the specific needs of the individuals seeking help, their eligibility, and the specific TRICARE plan they are enrolled in.

The extent of coverage may depend on the specific needs and plan of the individuals seeking help.

Types of Treatment Covered by TRICARE

TRICARE offers several treatment options that may be beneficial for couples in need of rehab. These services can be broadly categorized into inpatient treatment, outpatient treatment, and other specialized services.

TRICARE also covers other drug rehab services in addition to inpatient and outpatient rehab, which are crucial for couples dealing with substance use disorders.

Inpatient Rehabilitation

Inpatient rehab, also known as residential treatment, involves patients staying at a treatment facility for an extended period, where they receive intensive therapy and support. TRICARE typically covers inpatient rehab, but certain guidelines must be met to qualify for this coverage.

For couples struggling with addiction or co-occurring mental health issues, this type of rehab can offer a structured environment where both partners can focus on recovery together. TRICARE typically covers inpatient rehab, but the length of stay and specific services provided will depend on the individual’s treatment needs and plan.

Outpatient Rehabilitation

Outpatient rehab allows patients to continue living at home while attending scheduled therapy sessions at a clinic or treatment center. Couples in outpatient rehab participate in group or individual therapy, but they are not required to stay overnight.

Outpatient services are often used as a step-down approach after inpatient treatment or as a standalone option for those with less severe addiction or mental health issues. TRICARE generally covers outpatient rehab, and the services provided may include counseling, group therapy, and medication management.

Detoxification

For couples who are struggling with substance use disorders, detoxification can be the first step toward recovery.

Detox programs for couples help individuals safely manage withdrawal symptoms as they cleanse their bodies of addictive substances. TRICARE typically covers medically supervised detoxification when it is deemed necessary for the individual’s recovery.

Mental Health Services

Many couples dealing with addiction also struggle with mental health conditions such as depression, anxiety, or trauma. TRICARE covers a wide range of mental health services, including therapy and counseling for couples. TRICARE covers therapy for couples when at least one partner has a diagnosed mental health condition, such as PTSD or depression.

These services may include individual counseling, couples therapy, cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT), and trauma-focused therapy, among others. It’s important to work with your treatment provider to ensure that mental health services are included in your rehab program.

How to Verify TRICARE Rehab Coverage

To ensure that your rehab services are covered under TRICARE, there are a few key steps you should take.

Contact Your TRICARE Provider

The first step in verifying your TRICARE coverage is to contact your TRICARE provider directly. Each TRICARE plan may have different coverage rules, so it’s crucial to obtain accurate information from your provider about the specifics of your plan. Your provider will be able to tell you which substance abuse treatment services are covered, how long coverage lasts, and what if any, out-of-pocket costs you may be responsible for.

Review Your Plan’s Benefits

TRICARE offers multiple plans, including TRICARE Prime, TRICARE Select, and TRICARE for Life. Each TRICARE insurance plan may have different coverage options, so it’s important to review the benefits associated with the plan you’re enrolled in. For example, TRICARE Prime requires referrals for specialty care, including rehab services, while TRICARE Select allows beneficiaries to seek care without a referral. Knowing the details of your plan will help you understand the level of coverage available for couples rehab.

Check with the Treatment Facility

Once you’ve confirmed your plan’s coverage, the next step is to check with the rehab facility you’re considering. Many treatment centers work directly with TRICARE and can verify your coverage ahead of time. They can also provide a breakdown of costs and help you understand what services are included in your treatment plan. Choosing a facility within the TRICARE drug rehab network can help minimize out-of-pocket costs.

Pre-Authorization

Some TRICARE plans may require pre-authorization for certain rehab services, particularly inpatient care. This means you’ll need approval from TRICARE before starting treatment to ensure that it will be covered. Be sure to ask the treatment facility about this process to avoid any delays or surprises when it comes time to begin your rehab program.

Finding the Right Rehab Facility

Finding the right rehab facility can be a daunting task, but Couples Rehab Guide can help make the process easier. We will assist you in researching different facilities and their treatment options to determine which one best meets your needs.

This can involve reaching out to the admissions team, reviewing documentation, and seeking recommendations from healthcare providers. TRICARE couples rehabs, for instance, may offer a structured environment and a variety of services, including group counseling and CBT, to help couples work through their issues and develop healthier communication patterns.

Additionally, considering factors such as location, cost, and insurance coverage can help narrow down the options. In Tennessee, for example, there are several rehab facilities that accept TRICARE insurance and offer a range of treatment programs. By taking the time to carefully evaluate different facilities and their offerings, individuals can find the right fit for their recovery needs.

What to Expect During TRICARE Couples Rehab

When you and your partner enter a couples rehab program under TRICARE, you can expect a comprehensive treatment plan tailored to both your needs. Here’s a general idea of what to expect during the rehab process:

Initial Assessment

At the beginning of your rehab journey, both partners will undergo an initial assessment to evaluate your needs. This may include a physical and mental health evaluation, as well as a review of your substance use history. Based on this assessment, your treatment team will create an individualized plan that addresses both of your unique challenges.

Joint Therapy Sessions

One of the core components of couples rehab is couples counseling, where both partners work together with a therapist to address relationship dynamics and personal issues related to addiction or mental health. Couples therapy can help strengthen communication, rebuild trust, and create a supportive environment for recovery.

Individual Therapy Sessions

In addition to joint therapy, you and your partner will likely also participate in individual therapy sessions. These sessions allow each person to work on their own personal issues, whether related to drug and alcohol addiction, trauma, or mental health. This individualized approach ensures that both partners receive the care and attention they need to heal.

Group Therapy and Support

Many rehab programs incorporate group therapy, where patients meet with others facing similar challenges. Group therapy can help couples connect with others in recovery and share experiences in a supportive environment. It also provides an opportunity to learn from others and gain new perspectives on the recovery process. Additionally, group therapy sessions focus on improving communication skills among couples.

Aftercare Planning

After completing a rehab program, it’s important to have a solid aftercare plan in place to maintain your progress. TRICARE covers certain aftercare services, such as outpatient therapy, support groups, and relapse prevention programs. Your treatment center will help you and your partner develop a plan to stay on track after rehab and maintain long-term sobriety or mental wellness. Having a flexible schedule for aftercare services can help maintain long-term sobriety or mental wellness.

Planning Your Next Steps

Planning your next steps after deciding to seek rehab can be a challenging but crucial part of the recovery process. It’s essential to have a clear understanding of what to expect and how to prepare for the journey ahead. This can involve communicating effectively with your healthcare provider, gathering necessary documentation, and making arrangements for your care during the treatment period.

TRICARE insurance plans can provide coverage for many forms of rehab, including residential treatment and medical detox, but it’s necessary to review your specific plan to determine what is covered and what is not. By understanding your options and taking the necessary steps to prepare, you can set yourself up for success and create a solid foundation for your recovery.

Furthermore, having a support system in place, such as a spouse or child, can be incredibly beneficial in helping you stay sober and motivated throughout the recovery process. With the right mindset and support, individuals can overcome addiction and mental health issues and achieve a happier, healthier

While TRICARE covers rehab services, there may still be out-of-pocket costs depending on your plan. These can include co-pays, deductibles, and costs for non-covered services. Be sure to check with both your TRICARE provider and the rehab facility for a clear understanding of potential costs.

What if I don’t qualify for TRICARE coverage?

If you or your partner don’t qualify for TRICARE or if your plan doesn’t fully cover rehab services, there are other options to explore.

The purpose of the survey by The Joint Commission is to evaluate the compliance of NHB and outlying branch clinics with nationally established Joint Commission, Defense Health Agency and Navy Medicine standards of care specific to the needs of patients, including infection prevention and control, leadership, and medication management.

The inspection is conducted approximately every three years at Defense Health Agency and U.S. Navy military treatment facilities with the survey results used to determine whether, and conditions under which, accreditation should be awarded to the command.

By becoming an accredited organization, NHB enhances community confidence, provides a report card for the public, offers an objective evaluation of the organization’s performance, stimulates the organization’s quality improvement efforts, aids in professional staff recruitment, and provides a staff education tool.

An independent, not-for-profit organization, The Joint Commission accredits and certifies more than 20,000 health care organizations and programs in the United States. Joint Commission accreditation and certification is recognized nationwide as a symbol of quality that reflects an organization's commitment to meeting certain performance standards.

By asking for accreditation, NHB agrees to be measured against national standards set by health care professionals. An accredited organization substantially complies with Joint Commission standards and continuously makes efforts to improve the care and service provided.

TJC standards deal with organizational quality of care issues and the safety of the environment in which care is provided. TJC survey team usually consists of specially trained physicians, nurses, administrators and a facilities expert. The surveyors will evaluate NHB’s compliance with established standards and identify strengths and weaknesses.

First-Place Awards, Top Spot in Prestigious Categories

MHS civilians earned first place in eight categories, with Douglas Stutz at Naval Hospital Bremerton taking first for best information story about U.S. Navy Lt. Jane W. Njenga ensuring forces are medically ready when facing tropical diseases.

“We’ve had the honor to cover less-than-ideal subjects which still needed to be shared, including suicide and remembering loss on Memorial Day. Njenga’s commitment in the Military Tropical Medical Program offered us the opportunity to share how investing the time and effort can help save lives in future conflicts,” said Stutz.

When asked what drove him to enter the competition, Stutz said, “We submitted content to help highlight and hopefully increase focus on our valued Navy Medicine team of Navy Medical Corps, Medical Service Corps, Nurse Corps, Dental Corps, and especially our enlisted Hospital Corps and our support staff. Every one of them is a subject matter expert. They may not openly realize it, but we believe that each of our staff has a tremendous amount of value and insight to tap into, helping to share who, what, where, when, and why we do our work.”

Additional winners included Bernard Little from Walter Reed National Military Medical Center who won the prestigious Civilian Writer of the Year award, while Jorge Gomez from Irwin Army Community Hospital was named Civilian Videographer of the Year.

“I’m honored to have been recognized as the Civilian Writer of the Year among a very talented group of writers,” said Little. “I want people to know that the staff and care at Walter Reed is second to none. I want people to read the stories that I write and consider coming to Walter Reed for their care if they don’t. For those who do, I want them to feel pleased they are receiving their care here and continue to receive their care here, feeling secure and confident that they are receiving the best care anywhere.”

Brandon Henry from the Uniformed Services University won two top prizes—first place in both animation and multimedia product categories. Thomas Balfour, also from USU, won first place for his featured photo.

The university is no stranger to these achievements. “We’re very proud of the incredible talent we have here at USU,” said Sharon Holland, acting vice president for external affairs and director of alumni affairs. “Our writers, graphic designers, photographers, and multimedia staff have consistently been recognized for their work, either at the local level, the MHS level, the Department of Defense level, and sometimes all three. We’re thrilled to be part of a community that values excellence in telling the military health story.”

In similar categories, Thomas Cieslak from Naval Health Clinic Cherry Point won first in photojournalism, and Justin Moeller from Blanchfield Army Community Hospital took first in the picture story category.

Not only did MHS lead the competition with the most first-place wins, MHS secured the most second and third place finishes of any agency.

Honoring Creativity and Impact While Advancing Mission Readiness

The awards recognize communications professionals for more than just the quality of their products. They are honored for their role in advancing warfighter readiness and telling the military health story in creative, meaningful ways, said Richard H. Breen Jr., director of communications and public affairs for the Office of the Assistant Secretary of Defense for Health Affairs and the Military Health System. “The work of the MHS is beyond health care–it’s about ensuring that every service member is fit to fight, that our medical teams are trained and ready, and that our families receive the care they deserve. The awards capture the essence of this mission in one article, frame, photo, or video.”

“Winning or placing in any category at the DMMA is a testament to the MHS team’s creativity, precision, and ability to translate complex health topics into messages that resonate across the force,” said Derik W. Crotts, communication strategist with the MHS. “Their work directly supports warfighter readiness by ensuring the right information reaches the right people at the right time.”

The New York Times: Trump Aides Solicit Ideas To Raise Birthrate, From Baby Bonuses To Fertility Planning

The White House has been hearing out a chorus of ideas in recent weeks for persuading Americans to get married and have more children, an early sign that the Trump administration will embrace a new cultural agenda pushed by many of its allies on the right to reverse declining birthrates and push conservative family values. One proposal shared with aides would reserve 30 percent of scholarships for the Fulbright program, the prestigious, government-backed international fellowship, for applicants who are married or have children. Another would give a $5,000 cash “baby bonus” to every American mother after delivery. (Kitchener, 4/21)

The Washington Post: CDC Cuts Hamstring Programs That Monitor Fertility And Maternal Health

Federal programs that help people compare IVF clinics, monitor safety in fertility and make sense of health data have been scaled back by the Trump administration in a move some maternal health experts predict will have an enduring effect on women and children. Layoffs at the Department of Health and Human Services this month have dismantled teams at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention responsible for collecting and analyzing data on a range of subjects, including embryo transfers and maternal health disparities.

NBC News: Tricare Military Health Insurance Leaves Pregnant Women With Ultrasound Delays, Disrupted Care

In the throes of postpartum depression, the incision site from her Cesarean section still tender, a U.S. Navy veteran in Indiana learned she had been dropped by her health insurance. Some 500 miles away, in Lee’s Summit, Missouri, Air National Guard member Cortney Frazon was trying to check in for a 20-week ultrasound when she discovered her doctor no longer accepted her insurance. Faced with a crushing out-of-pocket cost, she left. (Chan, 4/18)

CNN: Puberty Conversations Are Starting Too Late, New Poll Reveals

For many parents, the idea of having “the talk” with their kids may be daunting, making them feel embarrassed or squeamish. But many parents are conflating the classic growing-up talk about sex with another crucial conversation they should be having, new research suggests. The talk in question should happen earlier than one may think, and it’s not necessarily about sex. It’s about puberty. (Lumer, 4/21)

Iowa Public Radio: Iowa House Passes Bill Requiring Fetal Development Videos Starting In 5th Grade

Public, private and charter schools in Iowa would be required to show fetal development videos to students starting in fifth grade under a bill passed Thursday by Republicans in the Iowa House. Human growth and development classes and health classes in grades 5-12 would have to teach about “human development inside the womb.” That would include an ultrasound video showing vital organs in early fetal development.

TRICARE is the health program for members of the U.S. military, veterans, and their families.
In Puerto Rico, it is administered through the TRICARE Overseas Program.
Of particular interest is TRICARE Prime, a managed care option within the TRICARE health care program, primarily available in specific Prime Service Areas (PSAs).
It’s worth noting that when the Philippines gained independence from the United States, veterans who had fought in the U.S. military lost their veterans’ benefits.","Puerto Rico Resident Commissioner Pablo José Hernández has re-introduced the TRICARE Equality Act. The legislative proposal, also introduced by Jenniffer Gonzalez-Colon in 2021 and then again in 2023, seeks to improve health benefits available to veterans living in Puerto Rico. Cosponsors of the 2025 bill include House Veterans Affairs Health Subcommittee lead Democrat Rep. Julia Brownley (CA), as well as Reps. Eleanor Holmes Norton (D-DC), and Hank Johnson (D-GA).

“Our veterans and military families in Puerto Rico have sacrificed just as much as their counterparts on the mainland, and they deserve equal access to the healthcare benefits they’ve earned,” said Hernández.

“The TRICARE Equality Act will help close the unacceptable gaps in care faced by our servicemembers, retirees, and their families on the island. By improving TRICARE Prime access, expanding travel benefits, and ensuring better coordination of health data, this bill takes a critical step toward treating Puerto Rico’s military community with the dignity and fairness they deserve.”

What is TRICARE?

TRICARE is the health program for members of the U.S. military, veterans, and their families. In Puerto Rico, it is administered through the TRICARE Overseas Program. Unfortunately, the benefits for residents of Puerto Rico do not match those in the states. Veterans on the Island often must pay for services upfront and wait for reimbursement, or even travel to a state for medical services.

Of particular interest is TRICARE Prime, a managed care option within the TRICARE health care program, primarily available in specific Prime Service Areas (PSAs). Prime members are assigned a Primary Care Manager (PCM) who coordinates most of their healthcare. Out of pocket costs are lower with Prime, and travel benefits cover the cost of travel to military healthcare facilities. The TRICARE Overseas Program is similar, but not equal to the Prime benefits.

What does the TRICARE Equality Act provide?

The TRICARE Equality Act calls for PSAs to be established in Puerto Rico as they are in the states — on the basis of the proximity of military medical care facilities such as those at Ft. Buchanan. It also calls for service members, veterans, and their families to have travel benefits as they would if they lived in a state.

The bill also mandates coordination between the Federal Electronic Health Record Modernization Office and the Department of Health of Puerto Rico to share health information through the Joint Health Information Exchange.

Why is there inequity?

The Supreme Court has repeatedly ruled that Congress can treat territories differently from states, and the differences in veterans’ benefits are examples of this freedom. Although Puerto Rican veterans can access the full range of U.S. Veterans Affairs (VA) benefits if they are living stateside, VA benefits for veterans living in the U.S. territory are less generous.

It’s worth noting that when the Philippines gained independence from the United States, veterans who had fought in the U.S. military lost their veterans’ benefits. Similarly, veterans of the U.S. military living in the U.S. freely associated states (FAS) of Palau, the Marshall Islands and Federated States of Micronesia were legally excluded from receiving VA healthcare in the FAS until last year; although veterans’ healthcare is now authorized within their borders, the programs have yet to be implemented.

These facts are in contrast to the optimistic ideas of separatists who claim that veterans would continue to receive their health benefits if Puerto Rico were to become a sovereign nation, or the small but vocal group of independence supporters living stateside who do not need to worry about the practical implications for U.S. veterans in Puerto Rico if the U.S.-Puerto Rico connection is severed.",https://i0.wp.com/puertoricoreport.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Untitled-design-742.png?fit=1920%2C1280&ssl=1,N,0.0,2025-04-21 11:56:33.824470

Not that you should have to endure a possible horrible reaction to get approved… but it’s how mine was approved.
So, a fairly unique circumstance, but ultimately they approved me for it without having to take the oral meds.","It’s all up to how the PA is filled out by your doctor. Express Scripts is super nice and helpful and I talked them extensively during my PA process because my doctors office kept filling out the forms wrong 😡😡. Bring the form into your doctor and discuss in person if you can, have them fill it out in front you and ask for a copy too. If you have a contraindication like an interaction with another medicine- then the doctor can discuss is in the form and it shouldn’t be an issue.

Side note- I used to be on antidepressants and anti anxiety’s a long time ago, but stopped taking them after I had kids (no good reason not to restart other than I was being stubborn). I’ve struggled for years off my meds, and Zep has made me feel new again. True happiness I haven’t felt in a long time. I’m not as irritable. Not as sad. More good days ❤️ Good luck with your journey!

Also- just in case…. I technically had contraindications to Qsymia/phentermine and was super adamant about not trying it. I went to an obesity specialist, who was not very kind and literally wanted to hear nothing about my contraindications concerns, and adamantly prescribed me Phentermine. I took ONE dose- had the most horrible reactions (racing heart, dizziness, irritability, etc etc) from ONE dose I told them not taking it again. I went back to my other doctor and told them my reactions. That counted as me trying and failing it for the sake of the form and my Zep PA was approved no problem after that. Not that you should have to endure a possible horrible reaction to get approved… but it’s how mine was approved.

I have TriCare as well and was able to get a PA without trying phentermine or the others. I had just worked with med management to get my adhd and anxiety under control for about a year and am on a stimulant, so i expressed my desires to my PCM that I didn’t want to get off of it because I was finally starting to feel good (you can’t take phentermine while on other stimulants). I also have a history of seizures, so I can’t take the other 2. So, a fairly unique circumstance, but ultimately they approved me for it without having to take the oral meds.

I know that the regulation state that you have to try three medication’s prior to going on Zepbound, but since my doctor had known me for the last 20 years and knew what I had been going through, he just zipped right through it and said I tried them all failed them and needed to go on Zepbound.Not sure if your doctor will do this for you or not but if you have to go through the steps, then do it.

I no longer am prediabetic, I no longer have sleep apnea either. I’m no longer at risk for 14 types of cancer that obese people get. I can run up and down the stairs after my granddaughters. I can walk across the room now without being short of breath. after 15 months on this miracle drug, I have lost 91 pounds. I am still considered overweight by another 15 pounds but that’s OK with me. Do I really wanna get back to what I was when I was 22 years old? I like who I am now in this body. I went from a size 22/24 to now a size 12. i’m not in maintenance yet as I would like to continue trying to lose some more weight. We are going on a cruise in a month and we’ll see what happens on that cruise. I am happy to say that my food noise is still being controlled and I have to remind myself sometimes to eat. But hunger is a good thing. now I find myself saying hey I’m hungry. I’m gonna try to eat this. And I may only eat half of it and again that’s OK. I’m sorry you don’t have a support of your mom that can be tough. I have a loving husband and two sons and three grandchildren that are cheering me on daily. Now my granddaughter did ask me if everything‘s going to change about me because she’s seen the change over the last 15 months. I told her that my heart will never change for her just the fat around it. I wish you the best of luck on this journey. Should you decide to take it. It is life-changing in so many aspects.

As NBC reports, Tricare - a lifelong benefit promised to many who serve, but one that has been plagued by widespread disruptions to service members, their families and the physicians who accept the insurance following a change in contracts.

Women across the country are speaking out about delays and denials of basic maternity because of improperly working Tricare.

NBC News collected numerous stories.

In Kansas City, at least two medical providers were telling Audrey Simmons they couldn’t see her because of ongoing negotiations with her insurance, leaving her with limited options during her high-risk pregnancy.

Then she found out that many others were in the same situation.

Marine Corps Sgt. Savannah Harper, 27, had trouble getting prenatal care in January after she transferred from a California base to one in Hawaii. She repeatedly called Tricare for help, enduring wait times of up to 90 minutes with no resolution - all leading to a full month overdue for her 20-week ultrasound.

Another issue is Tricare demanding repayment of previously paid claims. In Nevada, a Navy veteran and his wife said Tricare had rescinded over $100,000 in medical claims it had approved and paid years ago, NBC reports.

The result of Tricare so far: Missed diagnoses, confusion, stress, and unnecessary financial burdens. Our service members and veterans deserve better.

We call on the Defense Health Agency to fix Tricare coverage immediately. Ensure military families get timely, standard care without bureaucratic red tape.

Stop letting down the very people who served this country.
