He emphasized the importance of delivering high-quality medical care to those who we serve.

“We’re here to support the warfighter, and I don’t think there’s a place that could embody that more than Fort Bragg,” said Ferrara. Fort Bragg is one of the largest U.S. military installations in the world with more than 50,000 service members assigned.

As the principal medical advisor to the Secretary of Defense and the Undersecretary of Defense for Personnel and Readiness, Ferrara oversees health policy, programs, and force health protection across the MHS. Since his appointment to his position on Jan. 20, he has been visiting and touring military medical facilities to collect firsthand feedback to understand local issues and successes, which helps him advocate for the staff and resources needed.

During the visit, he met with key leaders, department chiefs and toured various medical units to gain a deeper understanding of the unique aspects of WAMC’s mission and the challenges faced by health care providers in the field. Ferrara also presented coins to several individuals who have played a vital role in WAMC’s success, recognizing their dedication and hard work.

At a town hall with Womack staff, he emphasized that one of the most important parts of his job is being the voice of healthcare providers and personnel.

“What makes the Military Health System unique is there are many great health care systems in America, but we’re the only American healthcare system that goes to war,” he said. This means a high level of readiness is required for medical forces supporting both deployed personnel and their families with high-quality care.

“I’m your voice,” Ferrara said. “When I’m advising up, its essential to have that kind of understanding, to hear from people that do the work. The reason we're doing all that is not only to help our beneficiaries by taking care of them, but it's to maintain our readiness.”

Ferrara also emphasized the importance of collaboration between the Department of Defense and Department of Veterans Affairs. “We’re working together more closely than ever before, and that’s going to lead to better care for our veterans and our beneficiaries.”

“By taking care of veterans, we’re not only improving their health outcomes, but were also improving readiness and generating revenue for our military treatment facilities,” Ferrara explained.

The Military Health System is committed to delivering high-quality medical care to warfighters and their families ensuring their wellbeing and supporting their service.

On September 1st, the House Appropriations Subcommittee on Labor, Health and Human Services, Education, and Related Agencies issued its draft fiscal year 2026 spending bill. In this bill the subcommittee eliminates funding for the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ). The bill will be voted on by the full Appropriations Committee later this month. American Liver Foundation will closely monitor the bill and the effect this will have on the first-ever national study to assess the prevalence of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), now called metabolic dysfunction associated steatotic liver disease or MASLD currently underway at AHRQ.

The crisis within the TRICARE system is jeopardizing the health and stability of veterans, service members, and their families.

Critical data transfer failure, rooted in flawed software implementation and deployment of an inaccurate database on a live platform, has inflicted immeasurable damage upon providers and patients with no end point or solution.

Beneficiaries and health care providers are grappling with unprecedented barriers to accessing care.

In its new report accompanying the 2026 National Defense Authorization Act, or NDAA, the House Armed Services Committee has included provisions requiring detailed reviews of TRICARE claim processing delays and the implementation of a study to investigate the Department of Defense’s Military Health System's new TRICARE T-5 contract.

The provisions call on the Department of Defense to submit two comprehensive reports to Congress by March 31, 2026. These reports will examine:

The root causes of TRICARE claim and payment delays, including contractor transitions, staffing shortages, and system inefficiencies

The number of affected providers and beneficiaries, including disruptions in care, delayed authorizations, and access

Performance metrics like average claim processing times and payment timelines broken out by region and contractor

The reasons health providers left the TRICARE network

The full scope and impact of the T-5 contract implementation in TRICARE East and West regions

You can read the full House NDAA report language here.

Calling APTA members who treat TRICARE beneficiaries: If you're still experiencing delays or challenges with TRICARE, we want to hear from you and assist you in your advocacy. Please contact APTA Advocacy for assistance.

Thank u for listening to all this and I’ll really appreciate any input!","Before I start anything, I’m going to ask a medical professional when the time is right but from what I’ve read I need to do a few weeks of physical therapy regarding back pain before even bringing light towards the topic of a breast reduction for a high acceptance rate for the referral so that’s why I’m asking this question on here. So when the time comes for me to make an appointment with a plastic surgeon, one thing I’m really concerned about is weather they’ll let me choose a surgeon back in my home state. I’m aware that they can allow off base referrals but I don’t know if I’m pushing my luck with asking for an out of state surgeon, my mom’s offering to take care of me during my healing process. I will be granted convalescent leave since the surgery is considered a medical necessity so I really want to spend that time at home with proper care. Just to add I’m on shore duty in Hawaii and I’m from California so it’s really not that far. I know that there will be a consultation with the surgeon I’ll hopefully be able to choose that I’ll take my chargeable leave in order to go see. I really have thought of everything if u can’t tell lmao but I know this is a reach asking you guys but my minds all over the place and I have a appointment with my primary care doctor this following Monday so that’s when im going to ask for a referral regarding physical therapy. You can call this strategic or whatever but I don’t wanna go into my first appointment regarding this whole breast reduction topic with this question off the bat. My first step is to bring up my back pain that I’ve always had and my restriction to preform well during physical exercise (running etc) then after I’m done with the rounds of physical therapy I’m going to ask about the reduction. Just for a reference I’m 5’2, 105 and a 32DDD, literally my whole frame is my breasts and I’ve never been able to live comfortably and I’ve realized these past few months that I don’t have to keep living like this. I’m just really scared about this whole process and getting denied so that’s why I’m treading really carefully. Thank u for listening to all this and I’ll really appreciate any input!

TRICARE has issued a reminder to beneficiaries that while some dental procedures are covered under TRICARE medical plans only when they are tied to a covered medical condition, injury or disease (“adjunctive”).

They also need to be pre-authorized – except in case of emergency. In contrast, routine or restorative dental work remains under TRICARE Dental Program or other insurance.

Medical (with pre-auth): tooth removal after facial trauma, surgery for a jaw fracture, removal of tooth fragments embedded in soft tissue.

Dental (TDP): cleanings, fillings, crowns, most root canals, sealants/preventive care, extractions, and some orthodontics.

Not covered by medical: repairing or replacing a cracked tooth when not linked to a broader medical condition.

The TDP is a separate, premium-based plan for active duty family members, National Guard/Reserve members, and their families. TRICARE urges beneficiaries to confirm coverage with their medical plan contractor or United Concordia (TDP) before treatment to avoid delays or unexpected costs, according to tricare.mil.

“Behavioral Health officers don’t just work with individuals who are struggling; we also work with teams, units, and commands to help build systems and approaches that support optimization and mission accomplishment,” said Bloom.
The goals of Madigan’s BHSL are improving access to behavioral health care for active-duty service members, increasing mission readiness of operational units, potentially identifying those with behavioral health challenges as early as possible, increasing and improving communication between behavioral health professionals and operational unit leaders, and serving as a clinical platform for quality care delivery.

Alisha Bloom, Co-Chief, Specialty Behavioral Health Lane from Madigan's Behavioral Health Service Line (BHSL), was presented the American Psychological Association's Division 19 (Military Psychology Division) Arthur W. Melton Award for Early Career Achievement and a certificate of graduation from DIV 19’s Society Leadership Program.

As part of the Leadership Program, Maj. Bloom presented a Capstone project looking at the impacts of improved access to care on outcomes of the Psychological Health Intensive Outpatient Program (PHIOP) to the DIV 19 executive committee. Intensive Outpatient Programs (IOPs) are an intermediate level of mental health care designed to ensure frequent contact (several days per week) while delivering a concentrated intervention (between 2-6 hours per day) over a period of several weeks. Service Members in IOP are typically transitioning between levels of care. That is, they are either referred for “step up” care after showing symptom intransigence or elevated risk in outpatient care or for “step down” care after being discharged from inpatient treatment. The project showed significant beneficial impacts on symptoms reduction in reducing the wait times between intake and the first treatment session in PHIOP. She hopes to publish the results of her project soon.

Demonstrating initiative, Bloom filled in for a last-minute cancellation and presented at APA as part of a symposium on ""Leadership In and Outside the Military,"" alongside Dr. Stephen Bowles, Dr. William Brim, and retired Col. Bruce Crow. Bloom’s presentation, titled “Resilience, Collaboration, and Vision: Leadership in the Aerospace Industry,” focused on how behavioral science has been used in the aerospace realm to address leadership challenges and take away strategies for other organizations. “Behavioral Health officers don’t just work with individuals who are struggling; we also work with teams, units, and commands to help build systems and approaches that support optimization and mission accomplishment,” said Bloom.

The goals of Madigan’s BHSL are improving access to behavioral health care for active-duty service members, increasing mission readiness of operational units, potentially identifying those with behavioral health challenges as early as possible, increasing and improving communication between behavioral health professionals and operational unit leaders, and serving as a clinical platform for quality care delivery.

In addition to providing support for service members with its services and clinics, Madigan's BHSL has the largest number of behavioral health providers in the Army and offers comprehensive behavioral health services to all TRICARE eligible beneficiaries, such as: inpatient and outpatient psychiatric care; evaluation and management of psychotropic medications; individual, group and family psychotherapy; diagnostic evaluation and psychological testing; child and adolescent care; addiction treatment programs; family crisis emergencies; and more.

If you’re a veteran or part of a military family, you likely rely on TRICARE to help cover critical medications. A recent TRICARE announcement brings changes to weight-loss medication coverage that may impact you—or someone you care for. At Medicare Mentors LLC, we stand ready to guide Medicare eligible veterans, retirees, and their loved ones through these shifting tides.

What’s Changing?

Starting August 31, 2025, TRICARE is tightening coverage for weight-loss drugs—especially GLP‑1 medications like Wegovy and Zepbound. Almost overnight, previously approved prescriptions under TRICARE may no longer be covered, even if they had prior authorization. TRICARE Newsroom+1FacebookFacebook+9TRICARE Newsroom+9MOAA+9

Here’s the breakdown:

TRICARE (to include Tricare for Life) beneficiaries will no longer be covered for GLP‑1 weight-loss medications as of August 31, 2025. Stars and Stripes

TRICARE Prime, Select, and other premium-based plan holders (TRICARE Young Adult, Reserve Select, Retired Reserve, CHCBP) may still qualify—IF they meet strict clinical criteria, have a prescription from a network provider, and obtain prior authorization.

If for some reason your prescription (for anything) is ineffective or causing a bad reaction you could get a new prescription based on medical necessity.
My guess would be no, you probably can't get another dose now - maybe in a couple weeks.
I'd ask you doctor if they'll put in the prescription, and see what happens.","I have Tricare Prime. I’m not sure about when you are moving up in dose, but I had to lower doses because of GI issues and still had (2) 5mg pens and they covered a box of the 2.5s for me. I’d have them call it in and if it’s not covered just finish out your box and move up when you can. Or call Humana and ask (though responses may vary).

You can only find out by trying.

But typically - even for relatively inexpensive medication - you can't get a prescription before the amount you were give is used and you are due for a refill or renewal.

If for some reason your prescription (for anything) is ineffective or causing a bad reaction you could get a new prescription based on medical necessity. The difficulty would be that you are using somewhat subjective criteria - i.e. your appetite isn't suppressed sufficiently.

But as I posted, you can try because if you don't try you definitely won't get your dosage upped versus trying and possibly succeeding.

Insurances are going to vary widely on this. My guess would be no, you probably can't get another dose now - maybe in a couple weeks. But I know many people have stockpiled Zep based on taking advantage of loopholes about different doses being entirely different prescriptions, thus getting an extra box of the current dose that they don't intend to take right away and also a new box of a new dose. I'd ask you doctor if they'll put in the prescription, and see what happens.",,N,0.0,2025-09-05 12:56:30.685647

The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) has finalized the Health Data, Technology, and Interoperability rule, which will require certified electronic health records (EHR) systems to offer real-time drug cost information and support electronic prior authorization—streamlining clinician workflows, reducing patient surprises and advancing administrative efficiency.

This rule will require certified EHR vendors to embed prior authorization, benefit verification, and e‑prescribing within their EHRs—enabling smoother workflows and eliminating burdensome manual steps like faxing and portal hopping. The updated e-prescribing standards are also intended to improve patient safety by reducing medication errors, providing clearer prescribing directions, and ensuring more accurate dispensing across pharmacies. By integrating prior authorization directly into the prescribing process, physicians will spend less time navigating outdated systems and more time focused on patient care.

Key provisions of the rule include:

Real-time cost visibility – Physicians and patients will be able to view patient-specific drug pricing and compare alternatives across pharmacies at the point of prescribing.

Prior authorization – Certified EHR systems must enable physicians to check coverage requirements, compile documentation, and submit and track requests electronically within their existing workflows.

Interoperability – The rule establishes standardized data flows among EHRs, payors, and pharmacies, replacing inefficient legacy processes.

Modernized e-prescribing – New prescribing tools will help reduce errors, streamline medication management, and improve coordination between prescribers and pharmacies.

The new rule builds on the 2024 Interoperability and Prior Authorization Final Rule and reflects months of engagement between HHS, CMS, and major health insurers.

The California Medical Association (CMA), American Medical Association and others in organized medicine have made widespread calls over the past decade for meaningful prior authorization reform. AMA has called this final rule a major win for physician practices. “Not to overstate it, but this new policy could contribute to the demise of the fax era in medicine,” said AMA President Bobby Mukkamala, M.D. “By replacing phones, faxes, and portal-hopping with standardized, interoperable EHR connection points, HHS’ new policy turns AMA advocacy into measurable workflow relief and faster decisions.”

CMA will monitor implementation of this new rule and will continue to advocate for policies that reduce administrative burdens, protect physician autonomy and improve patient access to care.",https://www.cmadocs.org/Portals/CMA/Images/Newsroom%20Icons/federal-issues.jpg,N,0.0,2025-09-04 18:56:19.236059

Safe gambling techniques A way to reduce the harm that can result from gambling is to practice safe gambling techniques.
Setting limits on both time and money spent on gambling is a technique that helps reduce gambling harm.
Gambling can be addictive, so it’s essential to take regular breaks to help you stay in control and reduce the risk of problem gambling.
Indicators of addictive behavior include spending more time or money gambling than intended, feeling anxious or irritable when not gambling, hiding or lying about personal gambling habits, having financial difficulties because of gambling, and avoiding responsibilities at work or in relationships to spend time gambling instead.","SEPTEMBER 4, 2025 – For centuries, gambling has been a popular form of entertainment and leisure activity, but for some, it can be a source of risk and harm—and service members are no exception.

Historically, military members tend to gamble more often than their civilian counterparts. Research indicates certain factors associated with military service increase the risk for gambling problems among those actively serving and for those who served. A 2021 study found that problem gambling scores for past and current service members were more than double those of the civilians studied. The 2020 DOD Health Related Behaviors Survey indicated 51.3% of active duty service members reported engaging in some form of gambling in the previous year.

While gambling is generally considered recreational, it can adversely impact military personnel, their families, and unit readiness.

“Unhealthy gambling behaviors are an increasing problem across the Armed Forces today due to the ease of online/app sports betting,” said U.S. Army Lt. Col. Isaac Lopez, a clinical psychologist with Defense Health Agency-Public Health in Aberdeen, Maryland. “This behavior is increasingly troublesome as research has shown it can lead to more significant problems to include increased risk of substance abuse and behavioral health symptoms.”

Problem gambling impacts

Several factors contribute to higher rates of military gambling; examples include its being seen as either a way to develop cohesion or escape from stress and boredom, and 24-hour online and phone app access. Service members also tend to be risk-takers and are often more willing to engage in high-risk activities.

Studies have also connected alcohol use to rates of gambling, linking increased drinking with more significant amounts of gambling. More gambling typically leads to a higher risk for harm, such as financial difficulties, relationship problems, and mental health concerns.

Gambling can have a negative impact on physical health, especially for those engaging in high-risk gambling. For instance, risky gambling can lead to sleep deprivation, poor nutrition and substance abuse. Financial concerns resulting from gambling can bring about stress-related problems such as hypertension and increased tobacco, nicotine, and substance use.

Daily behavioral health can be influenced by high-risk gambling, increasing the chances of anxiety, depression, and suicidal thinking. A risk-taking gambling style can also aggravate existing mental health problems, such as substance use and posttraumatic stress. Excessive gambling may also result in relationship issues, including separation, divorce, and domestic violence, and may increase the risk for criminal behavior, such as theft and fraud.

According to the National Council on Problem Gambling, problem gambling is defined as “gambling behavior that causes disruptions in any major area of life: psychological, physical, social, or vocational.” The NCPG estimates that approximately 2 million Americans meet the criteria for problem gambling, with another 4–6 million experiencing problems related to their gambling behaviors.

Safe gambling techniques

A way to reduce the harm that can result from gambling is to practice safe gambling techniques. The first step is to view gambling as a leisure activity, not a way to make money. While winning is always possible, losing is just as likely. In fact, with the odds set in favor of the gaming industry, losing money over time is more likely, making it essential to gamble only with an affordable amount of money to lose.

Setting limits on both time and money spent on gambling is a technique that helps reduce gambling harm. Deciding in advance how much time and money to spend on gambling and sticking to that amount keeps more of your money in your pocket. Once the time or money limit has been reached, it is time to stop. Also, gambling is best experienced as a social activity with trusted friends; avoid gambling alone.

Another technique for reducing gambling harm is not chasing losses. Gambling to win back money lost can quickly become out of control and often leads to more losses. It’s important to accept that gambling involves losing, and the odds are not set in your favor. Using gambling tools that provide feedback on amounts spent can help prevent chasing losses and preserve any winnings earned.

Tips for sensible gambling

For many, gambling can be a fun and exciting activity, but it is important to realize you may win some of the time but will lose most of the time. The following tips can help you gamble sensibly:

Set a budget. Determine how much of your money you are willing to gamble; when you have reached that amount, stop gambling.

Don’t chase losses. If you lose money while gambling, don’t try to win it back by continuing to gamble. Doing so can lead to even bigger losses.

Take breaks. Gambling can be addictive, so it’s essential to take regular breaks to help you stay in control and reduce the risk of problem gambling.

Don’t gamble when you’re stressed or upset. Gambling can be a way to take a break from daily life, but it is not a way to deal with stress or negative emotions. If you are feeling stressed or upset, don’t gamble; instead, find healthy and safe ways to relax and cope with your feelings.

Don’t gamble if you have a history of addiction. If you have a history of addiction, gambling is not a healthy activity for you. Talk to your healthcare provider about ways to manage your addiction and avoid gambling altogether.

Know the odds. Before gambling, understand how the odds work and the risks of winning and losing. This knowledge will help you decide how much of your money you’re willing to risk and when to stop gambling.

Don’t let gambling interfere with your life. If you decide to participate in gambling, do not let it interfere with your work, relationships, or other vital aspects of your life. If it does, it’s time to seek help.

Following these tips will help you experience gambling while lowering the risk of harmful outcomes.

Resources

When gambling becomes hard to manage or is out of control, it can become self-destructive, like a substance use disorder. Indicators of addictive behavior include spending more time or money gambling than intended, feeling anxious or irritable when not gambling, hiding or lying about personal gambling habits, having financial difficulties because of gambling, and avoiding responsibilities at work or in relationships to spend time gambling instead.

If any of these signs is present, it is time to seek help. It’s not uncommon for gamblers to feel isolated or ashamed; some may even have thoughts of suicide. There are resources available to find support for gambling concerns:

Leaders from the Uniformed Services University (USU) recently joined top military and DoD civilian health officials at an executive forum to address a critical workforce shortage of Certified Registered Nurse Anesthetists (CRNAs) across the Military Health System (MHS). The meeting, held in Bethesda, Md., convened Nurse Corps Chiefs from the Army, Navy, and Air Force, as well as senior leaders from the Defense Health Agency (DHA), the Office of the Secretary of Defense (OSD), and USU. The forum's main goal was to identify short- and long-term strategies for increasing the CRNA workforce.

Dr. Jonathan Woodson, USU president, and Dr. Carol Romano, dean of USU’s Daniel K. Inouye Graduate School of Nursing (GSN), participated in the forum and were joined by other key GSN leaders. The forum was tasked by the acting Assistant Secretary of Defense for Health Affairs, Dr. Stephen Ferrara.

The day's discussions, co-led by Ms. Susan Orsega, Deputy Assistant Secretary of Defense for Health Services Policy & Oversight, a USU alumni and a family nurse practitioner, focused on several key areas. Participants discussed CRNA recruitment, training pipelines, and retention challenges. They also explored the impact of the CRNA shortage on operational readiness and shared existing initiatives and potential solutions.

“As we look across the Defense Health enterprise,” said Orsega, “we’re facing dynamic operational demands, increasing clinical complexity, and growing competition for highly skilled nurses. To meet those challenges, we must ensure that our workforce—particularly our advanced practice registered nurses, or APRNs—is ready, resilient, and supported by a system that enables their full potential. This meeting is focused specifically on Certified Registered Nurse Anesthetists—a critical part of our provider teams, and an especially valuable asset in both garrison and deployed environments. The forum is about actionable immediate solutions, not just analysis. What we learn here today will inform not only CRNA workforce policy, but will help shape the foundation for discussions with Service Surgeons General, Nurse Corps Chiefs and other leaders across the DoD. “

A significant portion of the forum was dedicated to the role of the GSN in Advanced Practice Registered Nurse (APRN) education, specifically for nurse anesthetists. GSN leaders presented on the current status of their Nurse Anesthesia program and discussed challenges and opportunities to increase the training pipeline. The forum's collaborative approach was praised for generating actionable recommendations to address existing barriers.

“Certified Registered Nurse Anesthetists (CRNAs) are the primary providers of anesthesia care in the U.S. military, serving on the front lines and in military hospitals worldwide,” said Romano. “Their ability to operate autonomously in high-stress, austere environments is critical for ensuring that life-saving surgical procedures can be performed wherever they are needed. USU provides a major education pipeline for CRNAs who are prepared for the unique demands of military medicine. The GSN at USU was honored to play a leadership role in collaborating with the DASD to plan, co-host and participate in this important forum.”

The forum underscored the importance of CRNAs as a ""critical force multiplier"" in both clinical and operational settings due to their cost-effective contributions to anesthesia delivery. Following the meeting, Orsega expressed her appreciation for the collaboration and the commitment shown by all attendees to enhancing workforce development, readiness, and long-term retention of CRNAs across all services.

The meeting served as the initial step in a broader effort to address all APRN roles in the coming months. Orsega added, “We fully recognize that other APRN roles—Nurse Practitioners, Clinical Nurse Specialists, and Nurse Midwives— also face workforce challenges that deserve focused attention.” A second meeting has been scheduled for October 22 to continue this important work.",https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEiw0RpswdFIrwD_DQdzxYv-ry2UtorFMVSR7ZJteQa-2DCY-gU4M8W_c9KBLCix4pFwwbA-YEkTtC_awWN3NfrY3861LJFgOtFPqWnrDmKIHGNYEtOQ7jI9PB6-g6aTuOWm_qp5tskzIrWe1tnozxuvkDBVLtoUMF3qeyJqL43JJP2I5GK4jFMKzzuul0I/w1200-h630-p-k-no-nu/edit250813-F-IY571-1009_NurseCorpsChiefsHJF.jpg,N,0.0,2025-09-04 14:56:16.305765

Getting the most out of an experimentation event requires beginning the planning process far in advance.","FORT DETRICK, Md. – Before new military medical capabilities developed at the Defense Health Agency Research & Development-Medical Research and Development Command can be delivered to the Warfighter, they must be evaluated to ensure they are ready for use in real-world conditions. For many devices, the best way to do that is to put them into the hands of Service Members participating in Army, joint service, and multinational training exercises, and let them “kick the tires” in the field. Making that happen is the responsibility of DHA R&D-MRDC’s Experimentation Integration Cell.

Since its inception in 2022, the EI Cell has helped researchers throughout the command participate in a large number of experimentation events, ranging in scale from tabletop exercises to the annual Project Convergence Capstone joint and multinational event. The user feedback from participants in these events has helped the researchers improve the design, functionality, and reliability of their capabilities – leading to new cutting-edge treatments and devices that ensure our Warfighters remain resilient, adaptable, and lethal in any scenario.

“Military medicine doesn’t exist in a vacuum,” says Eva Rosvold, the EI Cell’s director. “Participating in service-centric experimentation events is valuable because it allows designers to see how their products are used in the larger operational context. The information gleaned from events can materially shape the development path of the capability and lead to significant improvements and innovations.”

Rosvold moderated a well-attended panel discussion on “Positioning Innovative Products for Future Force Integration through Key Military Exercises” at the 2025 Military Health System Research Symposium in Kissimmee, Florida, in August. The session included speakers from DHA R&D-MRDC, the Center for Naval Analyses, the U.S. Army Medical Capability Development Integration Directorate, and the U.S. Marine Corps Warfighting Laboratory. The panelists shared their insights on identifying opportunities for experimentation, preparing products for experimentation, and applying the lessons learned from experimentation events to iterate improvements.

Rosvold was among over 200 DHA R&D-MRDC experts in military infectious diseases, combat casualty care, military operational medicine, chemical biological defense, and clinical and rehabilitative medicine who attended the annual event, the DOD's premier medical science research and development meeting. To see photos of DHA R&D-MRDC's participation in this year's MHSRS, visit the event's Flickr album.

Getting the most out of an experimentation event requires beginning the planning process far in advance. The EI Cell works with researchers to identify events that are appropriate for the type of product they are developing, the product’s technology readiness level, and the outcomes that the researchers are seeking to gain from participating in the event. Advance planning is also important for coordinating logistics such as funding and travel. To help get the most out of an experimentation event, Col. Laura McGhee, whose responsibilities at DHA R&D-MRDC include translational science and military performance, says that researchers should try to answer several questions early on in the planning process, such as: Is it a physical product? What is its purpose? How will it be used in the operational environment? Who will be using it? Does it match the goals of the exercise?

“It's important to target your product to a particular experimentation event, because not all events have the same scale or level of complexity, and not all products are at the same technology readiness level,” says McGhee, who spoke about the most effective ways to translate laboratory research into experimentation at the MHSRS panel session. “It's a matching game.”

User feedback from experimentation events can drive design choices and iterations that improve usability and experience – all of which directly benefits the Warfighter. Such feedback, for example, was crucial for helping researchers at DHA R&D-MRDC to identify improvements that could be made to their pioneering standoff casualty detection and vitals monitoring designed to operate as a small unmanned aerial system camera payload. Over the course of four years, the team was able to continuously update and iterate the system’s design, hardware choices, and user interface based on feedback provided by Soldiers who participated in four real-world experimentation events.

“While experimentation, especially for larger events, is mainly seen as a venue for rigorous evaluation, it also can be an invaluable tool for continued research and development,” says Ethan Quist, an expert in medical robotics and autonomous systems at DHA R&D-MRDC, who spoke about his team’s experience at the MHSRS panel session. “Failing early in R&D will lead to earlier lessons learned, force the adoption of a Soldier-centered design mindset, and lead to more mature testing and evaluation.”

Originally, Quist’s team collected data from short test flights in parks and public spaces near their lab, using simulated casualties and mannequins. While these experiments provided valuable initial data for validating the system’s algorithms, they lacked the fidelity of an operational setting. An invitation from MED CDID to participate in the Project Convergence 4 capstone exercise presented an opportunity to pivot the project toward a more operator-centered design. First, the team needed to participate in a risk-reduction event – Northern Strike 2023, an Army National Guard exercise in Michigan. The team developed a preliminary user interface to display vital sign data on the UAS controller, which required them to identify the information that would be most useful to medics and determine how best to present and deliver it. For PCC4, the team successfully developed a software plugin that allowed the drone data to be integrated into the Android Team Awareness Kit, a smartphone-based targeting, navigational, and data sharing system widely used by the DOD.

The following year, Quist’s team took their improved system to Northern Strike 2024 and PCC5, where they further refined their human-detection and vitals monitoring algorithms, and improving the robustness and usability of the system’s software. Their experience also revealed limitations in their chosen UAS platform that can be addressed in future experimentation exercises. The lessons learned at PCC5 opens the door for potential integration with many program-of-record UAS platforms – resulting in a far more sophisticated and capable system than the initial vision of what the system could be.

Quist says that the support provided by the EI Cell was crucial for enabling his team to continue evolving the hardware and software in response to user feedback obtained at the various experimentation events. By serving as a single point of contact for both the researchers and the exercise sponsors, and by providing logistical support to the experimentation team before, during and after the experimentation events, the EI Cell allowed the team to focus its efforts on improving the system’s hardware and software, rather than on logistics. It’s a lesson – and a partnership – that his team will exploit for future evaluation activities.

“Our goal is to get out of the lab early, leverage experimentation events, collect the most relevant data we can, iterate on performance between events, and keep the Warfighter at the center of all development and design choices,” says Quist. “The question is not if the technology works, it’s if the technology makes an impact on the Soldier’s ability to complete their mission.”",https://d1ldvf68ux039x.cloudfront.net/thumbs/photos/2509/9293062/1000w_q95.jpg,N,0.0,2025-09-04 14:56:21.106180

The lawsuit claims Army researchers have recognized a connection between service members exposed to repeated explosions, like Card, and increased rates of anxiety, paranoid thinking, and aggressive behavior.
In the months before the Lewiston shooting, members of his unit warned their leadership that Card was making threats about mass shootings and had a collection of firearms.
Despite the findings, Card was discharged on the condition that the U.S. Army would remove his weapons, attorneys for the victims said.
That never happened, and the U.S. Army did not follow up with him to ensure he was following a treatment plan and receiving the help he needed, the lawsuit claims.","CHICAGO - A group of more than 100 survivors and families of victims killed in the 2023 mass shooting in Lewiston, Maine, sued the U.S. government over claims it failed to respond to repeated warning signs that the shooter, an Army reservist, could become violent.

The lawsuit, filed in federal court in Portland, Maine, on Wednesday, claims the U.S. Army, the U.S. Department of Defense, and a New York Army hospital were negligent in their handling of Army Reserve Sergeant Robert Card, who had exhibited signs of severe mental illness for more than a year before the shooting and made explicit threats to carry out mass violence.

The October 25, 2023, shooting killed 18 people and wounded 13 at a bowling alley and a restaurant. Card was found dead of a self-inflicted gunshot wound two days later.

The lawsuit claims that by March 2023, the U.S. Army knew Card, a 20-year veteran of the U.S. Army Reserve and a West Point firearm and grenade instructor, was paranoid, delusional, and violent, and that he had a hit list and access to firearms. But the Army did not remove Card’s guns, dissuaded law enforcement from taking the guns, and dismissed Card’s threats to “shoot up” a Maine Army Reserve center in the month before the massacre, the victims say in the lawsuit.

In a statement, Army spokesperson Lieutenant Colonel Ruth Castro said the Army does not comment on pending litigation. A Department of Defense spokesperson also declined to comment on pending litigation, and representatives for Tricare, the military's healthcare agency, did not respond to a request for comment.

Cynthia Young, whose husband William and 14-year-old son, Aaron, were both killed at the bowling alley, is among those suing.

In a statement, she said, ""We trusted those in power to protect our loved ones, and their inaction cost us everything.""

The lawsuit seeks monetary damages for pain and suffering, medical and funeral expenses, emotional distress, and more. Attorney Ben Gideon said at a press conference that it was too early to say how much the plaintiffs would seek.

The lawsuit claims Army researchers have recognized a connection between service members exposed to repeated explosions, like Card, and increased rates of anxiety, paranoid thinking, and aggressive behavior.

Citing other mass shootings committed by veterans and service members, the lawsuit claims the U.S. Army has developed a detailed procedure for dealing with service members whose mental health may make them a threat to themselves or others, but did not follow it in Card's case.

In the months before the Lewiston shooting, members of his unit warned their leadership that Card was making threats about mass shootings and had a collection of firearms. Card was sent to Keller Army Community Hospital in West Point, New York, for an involuntary psychiatric evaluation, where providers found he had homicidal ideation and was a threat to others.

Despite the findings, Card was discharged on the condition that the U.S. Army would remove his weapons, attorneys for the victims said. That never happened, and the U.S. Army did not follow up with him to ensure he was following a treatment plan and receiving the help he needed, the lawsuit claims.
