“The motivation for focusing more on NASA was generated through our past performance work,” Howard explains.
“Once we started our first NASA contract, we could build expertise on more NASA work,” she says.
The company started with a defense contracting focus, emphasizing research and development, engineering, information technology, and mission operations support for DoD clients.
Building NASA Credentials HX5 entered NASA work through teaming arrangements rather than direct competition.","Through the third quarter of fiscal year 2024, NASA had directed $4.4 billion in prime contracting dollars to small business firms, a 20% increase over the previous year.

The agency consistently exceeds its Small Business Administration goals, creating opportunities for contractors who can navigate the technical requirements and compliance standards inherent in aerospace work.

Margarita Howard, the founder and CEO of government contractor HX5, built her company around Department of Defense contracts before the company touched NASA work. However, the transition from defense to space agency contracting was an organic progression driven by demonstrated capability and NASA’s openness to working with smaller firms, often collaborating with large contractors. HX5 now employs over 1,000 professionals supporting both DoD and NASA programs across over 20 states.

“The motivation for focusing more on NASA was generated through our past performance work,” Howard explains. “We were attractive to a large business, and they approached us about teaming with them on a NASA contract.”

That initial partnership created the foundation. “Once we started our first NASA contract, we could build expertise on more NASA work,” she says.

Defense Work as Foundation

Howard founded HX5 in Florida. Her background included Air Force service and subsequent work implementing the Tricare military health care program, where she observed the complete procurement cycle: bidding, contract award, implementation, transition.

The company started with a defense contracting focus, emphasizing research and development, engineering, information technology, and mission operations support for DoD clients. The work demanded professionals with advanced technical degrees and often required security clearances, credentials that can take months to obtain and create barriers to rapid hiring.

“Our focus is professional support services in research and development and in specialty areas, primarily the STEM fields of science, technology, engineering, and math,” Howard says. “So, across the DoD and NASA, those are the specialties that make up our primary workforce. [Our employees] have to have advanced education.”

The specialized workforce HX5 developed for defense contracts proved transferable to NASA requirements. Both agencies need technical expertise, operate under strict regulatory frameworks, and value demonstrated successes in previous contracting projects as crucial evaluation criteria.

The Subcontracting Path

HX5 pursued subcontracting opportunities before competing as a prime contractor. The approach addressed a fundamental challenge facing new defense contractors: procurement officers prioritize proven past performance, but companies can’t build performance records without winning contracts.

“When pursuing work as a subcontractor, you tend to focus on specific specialization areas, you network regularly with multiple prime contractors, and try to demonstrate the value you bring as a partner to the prime’s team,” Howard says.

Subcontracting provided revenue while HX5 built up the credentials needed for prime contract proposals. When that larger business approached HX5 about NASA work, the company had already established a track record supporting complex government programs.

At the same time, NASA’s procurement patterns create openings for experienced but smaller firms, avenues that don’t necessarily exist in all federal contracting. The agency selected 299 Phase I proposals in its Small Business Innovation Research program during 2024, investing $44.85 million total.

Building NASA Credentials

HX5 entered NASA work through teaming arrangements rather than direct competition. The initial contract generated performance data and client relationships that supported subsequent bids.

“Once we’ve been awarded a prime contract, it’s crucial to stay compliant with all contractual requirements, regulations, and reporting obligations, and we ensure we have the best teams in place to do this,” Howard says.

NASA’s procurement system emphasizes past performance heavily. Contractors who execute their first NASA contract successfully gain advantages in future competitions. The agency maintains detailed performance records through the Contractor Performance Assessment Reporting System, and contracting officers weigh these assessments when evaluating proposals.

The company eventually secured prime contracts with NASA. “We have won some, for our size company, very large prime contracts,” Howard notes.

The dual role—serving as both prime contractor and subcontractor depending on the opportunity—provides flexibility and revenue stability. Prime contracts carry greater responsibility and risk but also offer more control over program execution.

Technical Specialization as Differentiator

HX5’s workforce composition enables the company to compete for technically demanding contracts that smaller firms often can’t staff. The company prefers hiring candidates with prior NASA or DoD experience.

“Experience in their respective fields, while supporting these agencies’ respective programs and missions, is very different from experience gained working in the commercial world,” Howard says.

This hiring preference creates challenges in tight labor markets but yields staff who understand classified information handling, government reporting requirements, and the risk-averse culture characterizing both DoD and NASA operations.

HX5 has also continued to support training and hiring veterans with relevant real-world experience. The company’s veteran hiring practices earned recognition through the 2025 HIRE Vets Medallion Award, a federal program honoring employers for exceptional achievement in recruiting and retaining veterans.

The company also invests in professional proposal development capabilities. “Developing winning proposals that accurately show the company’s capabilities, solution approach, and value proposition in a compelling and compliant manner requires solid technical and cost expertise combined with effective proposal writing skills,” Howard says.

Many small contractors lack dedicated proposal teams and must assemble resources for each bid, creating quality inconsistencies. HX5’s investment in permanent proposal staff improved win rates and enabled the company to pursue multiple opportunities simultaneously.

Dual-Agency Operations Today

HX5 now operates in over 20 states at government locations supporting both NASA and Department of Defense missions. The company has evolved from defense-focused startup to contractor serving two distinct but related federal customers.

“Building strong relationships with government agencies is an invaluable asset for successful government contractors as it can serve to provide the contractor with positive performance appraisals and sometimes even lead to new or additional business,” Howard says.

The company’s growth pattern reflects broader trends in government contracting. Small businesses that build credentials in one agency can leverage that performance history to expand into adjacent federal markets. The technical skills, compliance systems, and security infrastructure required for defense work translate to NASA requirements more readily than to many other federal agencies.

The progression requires patience, capital investment in infrastructure before revenue justifies it, and willingness to accept subcontractor roles while building toward prime contractor status.",https://www.finsmes.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Spacetech_Depositphotos_738858972_L-1024x674.jpg,N,0.0,2026-01-22 13:36:42.447678

Cervical cancer is preventable, yet it presents a significant health concern affecting thousands of women annually, Bunch explained.
“If a routine cervical health screening identifies a need for subspecialty care, WRNMMC can seamlessly provide Gynecologic Oncology subspecialty support and care from the Ob/Gyn clinic,” she added.
A woman’s cervical health can also impact readiness, Bunch explained.

Col. (Dr.) Kristen Bunch, director of the Gynecologic Cancer Center of Excellence at WRNMMC. Bunch also serves as director of Fellowship in Gynecologic Oncology for the National Capital Consortium, which includes graduate medical education programs at military medical treatment facilities throughout the National Capital Region (NCR).

Cervical Health Awareness Month is observed during January to educate the public about cervical cancer prevention, early detection through Pap tests and Human Papillomavirus (HPV) screenings, and the importance of the HPV vaccine.

Cervical cancer is preventable, yet it presents a significant health concern affecting thousands of women annually, Bunch explained.

Bunch said the routine services provided at Walter Reed central to maintaining cervical health include annual well woman exams, Pap smears and HPV testing, pelvic exams, and breast screenings. “If a routine cervical health screening identifies a need for subspecialty care, WRNMMC can seamlessly provide Gynecologic Oncology subspecialty support and care from the Ob/Gyn clinic,” she added.

A woman’s cervical health can also impact readiness, Bunch explained.

“A service member’s cervical health can directly affect individual medical readiness, deployability, and unit readiness in ways that may be underappreciated, and is a force health protection issue, not just an individual concern,” Bunch stated. “Abnormal cervical screenings without proper follow-ups can affect deployable status.

Additionally, service members who miss routine cervical cancer screenings are at higher risk for late detection of disease, needing more treatment, or longer recovery times and duty limitations. Optimal cervical health supports readiness by minimizing preventable disease, reducing non-deployable time, and preserving long-term health and career longevity.”

MHS officials report that while the MHS “experiences the same resource management challenges as the rest of U.S. health care, [the MHS] also faces unique challenges posed by its patient population, some of whom undertake long assignments to remote and austere locations without infrastructure or medical providers necessary to support cytology screenings.”

According to a study reported by the MHS in May 2025 titled Trends in Cervical Cancer Screening Modality in the Active Component U.S. Military, 2013–2023, “the MHS practice patterns demonstrated a response to national guideline changes including increased co-testing and evidence of increasing primary HPV screening among women aged 30-64 years.”

Bunch added that all beneficiaries of Walter Reed who face a cervical health challenge can expect comprehensive evaluation and care from its robust women’s health and specialty oncology services. “The diagnostic workup is tailored to the specific findings and treatment planning [and] is done with a gynecology provider at WRNMMC. Additionally, beneficiaries may access specialty care with Gynecologic Oncology, Urogynecology, and Reproductive endocrinology/infertility specialists located at WRNMMC, as needed. Care is coordinated to ensure continuity and connection across Ob/Gyn and specialty services. Appointments can be made through the WRNMMC Women’s Health service line.”

“Maintaining cervical health is largely about prevention, early detection, and healthy habits,” Bunch said. “The most important advice can be summarized as:

“One, get regular cervical cancer screening. Your Ob/Gyn or health care provider can discuss the timing of screenings, and I recommend following up if results are abnormal.

“Two, get the HPV vaccine, if eligible. HPV causes the vast majority of cervical cancers and vaccination can be protective and preventative from infection.

“Three, practice safe sex by using condoms to reduce HPV and other sexually transmitted infections, limit sexual partners, and seek prompt evaluation and treatment if concerned about having a sexually transmitted infection.

“Four, avoid smoking which weakens the immune system and impairs the cervix’s ability to clear HPV, and

“Five, pay attention to symptoms such as abnormal bleeding, bleeding with intercourse, and vaginal discharge, and pelvic pain.”

Interest income on loans includes interest received on nonaccrual loans on a cash basis.","SPRINGFIELD, Mo., Jan. 21, 2026 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Great Southern Bancorp, Inc. (the “Company”) (NASDAQ:GSBC), the holding company for Great Southern Bank (the “Bank”), today reported that preliminary earnings for the three months ended December 31, 2025, were $1.45 per diluted common share ($16.3 million net income) compared to $1.27 per diluted common share ($14.9 million net income) for the three months ended December 31, 2024. Full-year preliminary earnings for 2025 were $71.0 million, or $6.19 per diluted common share, compared to $61.8 million, or $5.26 per diluted common share, for 2024.

For the quarter ended December 31, 2025, annualized return on average common equity was 10.16%, annualized return on average assets was 1.16%, and annualized net interest margin was 3.70%, compared to 9.76%, 1.00% and 3.49%, respectively, for the quarter ended December 31, 2024. For the year ended December 31, 2025, return on average common equity was 11.38%, return on average assets was 1.22%, and net interest margin was 3.67%, compared to 10.55%, 1.05% and 3.42%, respectively, for the year ended December 31, 2024.

Key Results :

Significant Expense Items : During the three months ended December 31, 2025, the Company recorded expenses related to adjustments to asset values for branch closures and certain leased facilities. Expenses totaling $259,000 and $287,000 were recorded in Other Income and Net Occupancy and Equipment Expense, respectively.

Net Interest Income : Net interest income for the fourth quarter of 2025 decreased $371,000 (or approximately 0.7%) to $49.2 million compared to $49.5 million for the fourth quarter of 2024, largely driven by the completion of accounting recognition in October 2025 of interest income from a previously-terminated interest rate swap, partially offset by lower interest expense on deposit accounts and other borrowings. Annualized net interest margin was 3.70% for the quarter ended December 31, 2025, compared to 3.49% for the quarter ended December 31, 2024, and 3.72% for the quarter ended September 30, 2025.

Asset Quality : Non-performing assets and potential problem loans totaled $9.5 million at December 31, 2025, a decrease of $7.1 million from $16.6 million at December 31, 2024. At December 31, 2025, non-performing assets were $8.1 million (0.15% of total assets), a decrease of $1.5 million from $9.6 million (0.16% of total assets) at December 31, 2024. See “Asset Quality” below.

Liquidity : The Company had secured borrowing line availability at the FHLBank and Federal Reserve Bank of $1.32 billion and $305.2 million, respectively, at December 31, 2025.

Capital : The Company’s capital position remained strong as of December 31, 2025, significantly exceeding the “well-capitalized” thresholds established by regulatory agencies. See “Capital” below.

Loans : Total net loans, excluding mortgage loans held for sale, decreased $333.5 million, or 7.1%, from $4.69 billion at December 31, 2024 to $4.36 billion at December 31, 2025. This decrease was primarily driven by decreases in other residential (multi-family) loans, construction loans, one- to four-family residential loans, and commercial business loans. Compared to September 30, 2025, net loans decreased $110.8 million. The Bank experienced significant loan repayments in the 2025 fourth quarter and year.

Selected Financial Data:

Three Months Ended December 31, December 31, September 30, 2025 2024 2025 (Dollars in thousands, except per share data) Net interest income $ 49,163 $ 49,534 $ 50,773 Provision (credit) for credit losses on loans and unfunded commitments 882 1,556 (379 ) Non-interest income 7,188 6,934 7,062 Non-interest expense 36,000 36,947 36,116 Provision for income taxes 3,194 3,043 4,346 Net income $ 16,275 $ 14,922 $ 17,752 Earnings per diluted common share $ 1.45 $ 1.27 $ 1.56

Joseph W. Turner, President and CEO of Great Southern, commented, “Our fourth quarter and full year 2025 results reflect the sustained success of our core banking operations and our commitment to long-term tangible book value appreciation, despite a volatile economic environment. Throughout the year, we remained focused on preserving net interest margin, protecting credit quality, controlling non-interest expense, and opportunistically repurchasing our stock. That discipline translated into solid profitability in the fourth quarter, with net income of $16.3 million, or $1.45 per diluted common share, compared to $14.9 million, or $1.27 per diluted common share, in the prior year period. For the full year, net income was $71.0 million, or $6.19 per diluted common share, compared to $61.8 million, or $5.26 per diluted common share, in the prior year.”

Turner noted, “Core performance remained solid during the quarter, supported by resilient net interest income, a steady net interest margin, continued moderation in funding costs, and disciplined asset-liability management. Net interest income totaled $49.2 million for the 2025 fourth quarter, down modestly from the prior-year quarter, due mainly to the end of quarterly recognition of interest income from a previously-terminated interest rate swap, as we had disclosed in prior filings. The quarterly recognition had been $2.0 million in prior quarters and was only $134,000 in the fourth quarter of 2025, since it ended in early October 2025. Despite lower interest income, effective management of funding costs reduced interest expense and mostly offset the decrease in interest income. The effective management of loan repricing and funding costs resulted in net interest margin expansion, reaching 3.70% in the fourth quarter of 2025, compared to 3.49% in the same quarter in 2024. Core deposits remained stable during the quarter, underscoring the strength of our customer relationships and the enduring value of our community banking franchise. Compared to the third quarter of 2025, net interest income decreased $1.6 million, due mainly to the ending of income recognition from the previously-terminated interest rate swap.”

Turner added, “Loan production remained active during the quarter, though total net loans declined modestly due to heightened paydown and refinancing activity. These repayments were primarily within the multi-family, construction, one- to four-family residential, and commercial business loan portfolios. While we continue to be selective with loan originations, our pipeline of unfunded commitments remained solid, particularly within construction and commercial real estate lending. Additionally, our credit discipline, emphasis on relationship-based lending, and conservative underwriting standards remain evident in our excellent asset quality metrics.”

Turner further commented, “Non-performing assets were 0.15% of total assets at year-end 2025, and net charge-offs were negligible for both the fourth quarter and the full year. We did not record a provision for credit losses on loans during 2025.”

Turner continued, “Operating discipline remained a priority in the fourth quarter. Non-interest expense totaled approximately $36.0 million, in line with the prior-year quarter and the third quarter of 2025. As part of our focus on controlling operating costs, we continue to strategically invest in technology, infrastructure, and personnel, enabling efficiencies and ultimately expanding capabilities for our customers. The fourth quarter of 2025 also included certain facility-related costs incurred during the period which were not normal operating costs. In 2026, we expect to continue investing in technology. Non-interest income for the quarter totaled $7.2 million, supported by recurring fee-based revenue streams and increased loan-related fee income.”

“As we begin 2026, we remain focused on maintaining strong capital and liquidity positions, deploying capital thoughtfully, maintaining strong credit metrics, and supporting our customers and communities. At December 31, 2025, our tangible common equity ratio was 11.2%, and book value per common share was approximately $57.50, reflecting the benefit of consistent earnings and disciplined capital management, including share repurchases during the quarter and throughout 2025. While economic conditions and market interest rate levels may fluctuate throughout 2026, we believe our conservative approach, sound balance sheet, and dedicated associates position Great Southern to continue delivering long-term value for our stockholders,” Turner concluded.

NET INTEREST INCOME

Three Months Ended December 31,

December 31,

September 30, 2025 2024 2025

(Dollars in thousands) Interest Income $ 73,435 $ 82,585 $ 79,079 Interest Expense 24,272 33,051 28,306 Net Interest Income $ 49,163 $ 49,534 $ 50,773 Net interest margin 3.70 % 3.49 % 3.72 % Average interest-earning assets to average interest-bearing liabilities 129.5 % 127.0 % 128.1 %

Net interest income for the fourth quarter of 2025 decreased $371,000 (0.7%) to $49.2 million, compared to $49.5 million for the fourth quarter of 2024. This decrease was driven primarily by the $1.9 million net reduction in quarterly interest income associated with a previously-terminated interest rate swap (income ended on October 6, 2025). Additionally, interest income declined due to lower loan balances and lower market rates, which primarily impacted the interest rates on variable-rate loans and new originations of fixed-rate loans. Mostly offsetting the decrease in interest income was reduced interest expense, due to the strategic management of maturing/repricing brokered deposits and interest-bearing demand deposits. Also, there was no interest expense on subordinated notes in the quarter ended December 31, 2025, as those notes were redeemed in June 2025. Correspondingly, annualized net interest margin was 3.70% in the fourth quarter of 2025, compared to 3.49% in the same period of 2024 and 3.72% in the third quarter of 2025. The average interest rate spread was 3.16% for the three months ended December 31, 2025, compared to 2.87% for the three months ended December 31, 2024 and 3.13% for the three months ended September 30, 2025. Net interest income for the fourth quarter of 2025 decreased $1.6 million (3.2%) compared to $50.8 million for the third quarter of 2025, primarily due to the impact of the end of income recognition on the previously-terminated interest rate swap.

The average yield on total interest-earning assets decreased from 5.83% in the 2024 fourth quarter to 5.53% in the 2025 fourth quarter, with the average yield on loans decreasing 34 basis points, the average yield on investment securities increasing 12 basis points and the average yield on other interest earning assets (primarily funds held at the Federal Reserve Bank) decreasing 91 basis points. The average rate paid on total interest-bearing liabilities decreased from 2.96% in the 2024 fourth quarter to 2.37% in the 2025 fourth quarter, with the average rate paid on interest-bearing demand and savings deposits, time deposits and brokered deposits decreasing 26 basis points, 50 basis points and 76 basis points, respectively. The average rate paid on short-term borrowings decreased 70 basis points.

Market interest rates, primarily the federal funds rate and SOFR rates, declined in the fourth quarter of 2024, and remained lower through the fourth quarter of 2025, with additional federal funds rate cuts in September, October, and December of 2025, totaling 75 basis points. This market rate decline reduced the average yield on loans, though the impact was tempered as cash flows from lower-rate fixed rate loans originated a few years ago were deployed into residential and commercial real estate loans with comparably higher rates of interest. The decline in market interest rates also resulted in lower average rates paid on deposits and borrowings, compared to the prior-year fourth quarter.

To mitigate exposure to the risk of fluctuations in future cash flows resulting from changes in interest rates (primarily related to falling interest rates), the Company has strategically utilized derivative financial instruments - primarily interest rate swaps - as part of its interest rate risk management strategy.

The following table presents, for the periods indicated, the effect of cash flow hedge accounting included in interest income in the consolidated statements of income:

Three Months Ended December 31,

December 31,

September 30, 2025 2024 2025

(In thousands) Terminated interest rate swaps $ 134 $ 2,047 $ 2,047 Active interest rate swaps (1,364 ) (2,172 ) (1,761 ) Increase (decrease) to interest income $ (1,230 ) $ (125 ) $ 286

The Company entered into an interest rate swap in October 2018, which was terminated in March 2020. Upon termination, the Company received $45.9 million, inclusive of accrued but unpaid interest, from its swap counterparty. The net amount, after deducting accrued interest and deferred income taxes, was accreted to interest income on loans monthly until the originally scheduled termination date of October 6, 2025. With this date having passed, the Company no longer has the benefit of that income from the terminated swap. At December 31, 2025, the Company had two active interest rate swaps with a combined notional amount of $400 million. These swaps resulted in a reduction of interest income of $1.4 million and $2.2 million in the three months ended December 31, 2025 and 2024, respectively.

Market rates for time deposits for much of 2024 were elevated, but have declined as the FOMC cut the federal funds rate by 100 basis points in late 2024, 25 basis points in the third quarter of 2025 and 50 basis points in the fourth quarter of 2025. As of December 31, 2025, time deposit maturities over the next 12 months were as follows: within three months — $591.3 million, with a weighted-average rate of 3.53%; within three to six months — $262.9 million, with a weighted-average rate of 3.13%; and within six to twelve months — $38.7 million, with a weighted-average rate of 1.87%. Based on time deposit market rates in December 2025, replacement rates for these maturing time deposits are likely to be approximately 2.70-3.10%, depending on term.

NON-INTEREST INCOME

For the quarter ended December 31, 2025, non-interest income increased $254,000, to $7.2 million, when compared to the quarter ended December 31, 2024, primarily as a result of the following item:

Late charges and fees on loans : Late charges and fees on loans increased $289,000, or 218.9%, from the prior-year quarter. This increase was primarily due to prepayment fees on one large commercial real estate loan, which paid off in the 2025 fourth quarter.

Additionally, Other Income, which decreased by $67,000, includes $259,000 in contra-income associated with leased facility asset disposals, mentioned in the ‘Significant Expense Item’ section above.

NON-INTEREST EXPENSE

For the quarter ended December 31, 2025, non-interest expense decreased $947,000, to $36.0 million, when compared to the quarter ended December 31, 2024, primarily as a result of the following items:

Other operating expenses : Other operating expenses decreased $2.0 million, or 49.0%, from the prior-year quarter. In the 2024 period, the Company expensed $2.0 million due to developments related to a litigation/contract dispute matter.

Net occupancy and equipment expenses : Net occupancy and equipment expenses increased $1.2 million, or 13.9%, from the prior-year quarter. Various components of computer license and support expenses, related to upgrades of core systems capabilities and disaster recovery site, collectively increased by $593,000 in the fourth quarter of 2025 compared to the fourth quarter of 2024. During the three months ended December 31, 2025, the Company recorded expenses totaling $287,000 related to adjustments to asset values for branch closures and certain leased facilities. Also, during the three months ended December 31, 2025, the Company recorded a total of $219,000 of seasonal expenses for snow removal and adjustments to real estate taxes.

The Company’s efficiency ratio for the quarter ended December 31, 2025, was 63.89% compared to 65.43% for the same quarter in 2024. The Company’s ratio of non-interest expense to average assets was 2.56% for the three months ended December 31, 2025, compared to 2.46% for the three months ended December 31, 2024. Average assets for the three months ended December 31, 2025, decreased $381.1 million, or 6.4%, compared to the three months ended December 31, 2024, primarily due to the decline in the average balance of net loans.

INCOME TAXES

For the three months ended December 31, 2025 and 2024, the Company's effective tax rate was 16.4% and 16.9%, respectively. For the years ended December 31, 2025 and 2024, the Company's effective tax rate was 18.7% and 18.1%, respectively. These effective rates were below the statutory federal tax rate of 21.0%, due primarily to the utilization of certain investment tax credits and the Company’s tax-exempt investments and tax-exempt loans, which reduced the Company’s effective tax rate. The Company’s effective tax rate may fluctuate in future periods as it is impacted by the level and timing of the Company’s utilization of tax credits, the level of tax-exempt investments and loans, the amount of taxable income in various state jurisdictions and the overall level of pre-tax income. State tax expense estimates continually evolve as taxable income and apportionment between states are analyzed. The Company currently expects its effective tax rate (combined federal and state) will be approximately 18.5% to 19.5% in future periods.

CAPITAL

December 31, December 31, September 30, 2025 2024 2025 Consolidated Regulatory Capital Ratios (Preliminary) Tier 1 Leverage Ratio 12.2 % 11.2 % 11.9 % Common Equity Tier 1 Capital Ratio 13.6 % 12.3 % 13.3 % Tier 1 Capital Ratio 14.1 % 12.8 % 13.8 % Total Capital Ratio 15.3 % 15.4 % 15.1 % Tangible Common Equity Ratio 11.2 % 9.9 % 10.9 %

As of December 31, 2025, total stockholders’ equity was $636.1 million, representing 11.4% of total assets and a book value of $57.50 per common share. This compares to total stockholders’ equity of $599.6 million, or 10.0% of total assets, and a book value of $51.14 per common share at December 31, 2024. The $36.6 million increase in stockholders’ equity from December 31, 2024, was primarily driven by $71.0 million in net income, a decrease in unrealized losses on investments and interest rate swaps, and a $6.7 million increase from stock option exercises, partially offset by $18.8 million in cash dividends declared on the Company’s common stock and $44.5 million in common stock repurchases. The decreased unrealized losses on the Company’s available-for-sale investment securities and interest rate swaps, which totaled $32.2 million and $54.4 million (net of taxes) at December 31, 2025 and December 31, 2024, respectively, increased stockholders’ equity by $22.2 million during 2025. These net unrealized losses primarily resulted from increased intermediate-term market interest rates in prior periods, which generally decreased the fair value of the investment securities and interest rate swaps. In 2025, these market interest rates decreased, resulting in increases in the fair value of the Company’s investment securities and interest rate swaps.

The Company had unrealized losses on its portfolio of held-to-maturity investment securities, which totaled $16.6 million and $24.7 million at December 31, 2025 and December 31, 2024, respectively, that were not included in its total capital balance. If held-to-maturity unrealized losses were included in capital (net of taxes) at December 31, 2025 and December 31, 2024, they would have decreased total stockholder’s equity at those dates by $12.5 million and $18.6 million, respectively. These amounts were equal to 2.0% of total stockholders’ equity of $636.1 million at December 31, 2025, compared to 3.1% of total stockholders’ equity of $599.6 million at December 31, 2024.

In April 2025, the Company’s Board of Directors authorized the purchase, from time to time, of up to one million additional shares of the Company’s common stock. As of December 31, 2025, approximately 687,000 shares remained available under this stock repurchase authorization.

During the three months ended December 31, 2025, the Company repurchased 241,301 shares of its common stock at an average price of $59.33, and the Company’s Board of Directors declared a regular quarterly cash dividend of $0.43 per common share, which, combined, reduced stockholders’ equity by $19.2 million.

During the year ended December 31, 2025, the Company repurchased 755,759 shares of its common stock at an average price of $58.35, and the Company’s Board of Directors declared regular quarterly cash dividends totaling $1.66 per common share, which, combined, reduced stockholders’ equity by $63.3 million.

LIQUIDITY AND DEPOSITS

Liquidity is a measure of the Company’s ability to generate sufficient cash to meet present and future financial obligations in a timely manner. The Company’s primary sources of funds are customer deposits, FHLBank advances, other borrowings, loan repayments, unpledged securities, proceeds from sales of loans and available-for-sale securities and funds provided from operations. The Company utilizes some or all of these sources of funds depending on the comparative costs and availability at the time. The Company has from time to time chosen not to pay rates on deposits as high as the rates paid by certain of its competitors and, at management’s discretion, supplements deposits with alternative sources of funds. Management believes that the Company maintains overall liquidity sufficient to satisfy its depositors’ requirements and meet its borrowers’ credit needs.

At December 31, 2025, the Company had the following available secured lines and on-balance sheet liquidity:

December 31, 2025 Federal Home Loan Bank line $1,320.6 million Federal Reserve Bank line 305.2 million Cash and cash equivalents 189.6 million Unpledged securities – Available-for-sale 338.5 million Unpledged securities – Held-to-maturity 24.4 million

During the year ended December 31, 2025, the Company’s total deposits decreased $122.8 million. Interest-bearing checking balances increased $74.7 million (3.4%), primarily in certain money market accounts, and non-interest-bearing checking balances decreased $1.4 million (0.2%). Time deposits generated through the Company’s banking center and corporate services networks decreased $87.3 million (11.3%). Brokered deposits, obtained through a variety of sources, decreased $108.7 million (14.1%). During the three months ended December 31, 2025, the Company’s total deposits decreased $45.3 million, $16.6 million of which was in brokered deposits and $35.2 million of which was in retail time deposits. As total assets (primarily loans receivable) decreased, the Company elected not to replace some of its maturing brokered deposits.

At December 31, 2025, the Company had the following deposit balances:

December 31, 2025 Interest-bearing checking $2,289.4 million Non-interest-bearing checking 841.5 million Time deposits 688.4 million Brokered deposits 663.4 million

At December 31, 2025, the Company estimated that its uninsured deposits, excluding deposit accounts of the Company’s consolidated subsidiaries, were approximately $720.1 million (16.1% of total deposits).

LOANS

Total net loans, excluding mortgage loans held for sale, decreased $333.5 million, or 7.1%, from $4.69 billion at December 31, 2024 to $4.36 billion at December 31, 2025. This decrease was primarily driven by decreases in other residential (multi-family) loans of $161.8 million, construction loans of $96.5 million, one- to four-family residential loans of $51.3 million and commercial business loans of $41.8 million. Compared to September 30, 2025, net loans decreased $110.8 million.

The pipeline of the unfunded portion of loans and formal loan commitments remained strong, with the largest portion of these unfunded balances represented by the unfunded portion of outstanding construction loans ($605.5 million at December 31, 2025). See the table below.

For additional details about the Company’s loan portfolio, please refer to the quarterly loan portfolio presentation available on the Company’s Investor Relations website under “Presentations.”

PROVISION FOR CREDIT LOSSES AND ALLOWANCE FOR CREDIT LOSSES

During the three months ended December 31, 2025 and 2024, the Company did not record a provision expense on its portfolio of outstanding loans. During the year ended December 31, 2025, the Company did not record a provision expense on its portfolio of outstanding loans, compared to a provision expense of $1.7 million in the year ended December 31, 2024. Total net recoveries were $22,000 for the three months ended December 31, 2025, compared to total net charge-offs of $155,000 during the same period in the prior year. Total net recoveries were $11,000 for the year ended December 31, 2025, compared to total net charge-offs of $1.6 million during the prior year. Additionally, for the quarter ended December 31, 2025, the Company recorded a provision for losses on unfunded commitments of $882,000, compared to a provision for losses on unfunded commitments of $1.6 million for the same period in 2024. For the year ended December 31, 2025, the Company recorded a provision for losses on unfunded commitments of $45,000, compared to a provision for losses on unfunded commitments of $1.0 million in 2024.

The Bank’s allowance for credit losses as a percentage of total loans was 1.46%, 1.36% and 1.43% at December 31, 2025, December 31, 2024 and September 30, 2025, respectively. Management considers the allowance for credit losses adequate to cover losses inherent in the Bank’s loan portfolio at December 31, 2025, based on recent reviews of the portfolio and current economic conditions. However, if challenging economic conditions persist or worsen, or if management’s assessment of the loan portfolio changes, additional provisions for credit losses may be required, which could adversely impact the Company’s future financial performance.

ASSET QUALITY

At December 31, 2025, non-performing assets were $8.1 million, a decrease of $1.5 million from $9.6 million at December 31, 2024 and an increase of $319,000 from $7.8 million at September 30, 2025. Non-performing assets as a percentage of total assets were 0.15% at December 31, 2025, compared to 0.16% at December 31, 2024 and 0.14% at September 30, 2025.

This will be the Company's first Express Center in the St. Louis, Mo., market. In addition to the Cottleville location, the Company operates 17 other locations in the St. Louis metro region.

At the end of January 2026, the Company will consolidate operations of its Edina, Minn., banking center, located at 3400 W. 66th St., in Edina, Minn., with its banking center at 10880 175th Court in Lakeville, Minn.

NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES

This document contains certain financial information determined by methods other than in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (“GAAP”), specifically, the ratio of tangible common equity to tangible assets.

In calculating the ratio of tangible common equity to tangible assets, we subtract period-end intangible assets from common equity and from total assets. Management believes that the presentation of this measure excluding the impact of intangible assets provides useful supplemental information that is helpful in understanding our financial condition and results of operations, as it provides a method to assess management’s success in utilizing our tangible capital as well as our capital strength. Management also believes that providing a measure that excludes balances of intangible assets, which are subjective components of valuation, facilitates the comparison of our performance with the performance of our peers. In addition, management believes that this is a standard financial measure used in the banking industry to evaluate performance.

This non-GAAP financial measurement is supplemental and is not a substitute for any analysis based on GAAP financial measures. Because not all companies use the same calculation of non-GAAP measures, this presentation may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures as calculated by other companies.

Healthcare fraud settlements under the False Claims Act totaled over $5.7 billion for the 2025 fiscal year ended Sept. 30, the highest amount ever and more than triple last year’s total, the Department of Justice said Friday.

The FCA settlements fueled $6.8 billion in total judgments across industries, the highest amount in a single year.

In healthcare, settlements involved federal programs like Medicare, Medicaid and Tricare, the program for active and retired service members and their families. The Justice Department said it also expanded its enforcement in cases involving managed care, prescription drugs and medically unnecessary care.

Dive Insight:

The False Claims Act imposes penalties on those who defraud U.S. government programs. Defendants found liable can be subject to treble damages — three times the government’s damages, plus a penalty that’s tied to inflation.

The FCA also allows private citizens, or whistleblowers, to file lawsuits on behalf of the government. Whistleblowers can receive a portion of settlements: In 2025, whistleblowers received over $262 million for successful healthcare fraud lawsuits, according to data from the DOJ.

Healthcare has historically made up a majority of settlements in the FCA as federal health spending grows. Still, settlements were outsized in 2025 compared to 2024, when healthcare judgments totaled $1.7 billion.

Several of the settlements announced involved instances of fraud that occurred over a decade ago. Settlements may not be reached until many years down the road as cases make their way through court and both parties attempt to reach an agreement, according to Rachael Jones, principal at law firm McKool Smith and former deputy chief of the criminal division in the U.S. attorney general’s office in the northern district of Texas.

Whistleblowers may be driving some of the increase, as more citizens are incentivized to file suit as settlements circulate in the news landscape and on social media, according to Jones. A record-breaking 1,297 whistleblower cases were filed last year, after another high of 980 cases in 2024, according to the DOJ.

In healthcare specifically, whistleblowers may be more willing to come forward, according to Jones.

“When you find out the marketing schemes of the pharmaceutical companies or that doctors are doing something that’s not in the best interest of the patient ... The motivation to go after that is really high, because you can identify with the people,” Jones said.

Big healthcare settlements in managed care last year included those with New York-based Medicare Advantage insurer Independent Health, which agreed to pay up to $98 million to resolve allegations it submitted invalid diagnostic codes for reimbursement. Seoul Medical Group, its subsidiary Advanced Medical Management and its former president and majority owner agreed to pay over $60 million to settle allegations it submitted false diagnostic codes for spinal conditions to increase its MA payments.

In prescription drugs, the government settled with CVS’ long-term care pharmacy services provider Omnicare for $949 million over allegations it dispensed drugs to elderly and disabled people in assisted living facilities without valid prescriptions. It also inked a $450 million settlement with drug manufacturer Teva Pharmaceuticals over claims it engaged in kickback schemes.

In future years, more FCA settlements could emerge from cases involving big-name drugs or procedures that draw the most money, according to Jones. Novel procedures and drugs could also be a target.",https://imgproxy.divecdn.com/D7ecMU8bWPMfnZxo716eJPIzJMyyFJwfdabLrOsjrRs/g:ce/rs:fit:770:435/Z3M6Ly9kaXZlc2l0ZS1zdG9yYWdlL2RpdmVpbWFnZS9oZXJvX2Rval9mbGFnLnBuZw==.webp,N,0.0,2026-01-21 16:56:34.365867

This is a nightmare scenario our military families continue to face at an alarming rate in privatized military housing.

The Military Occupancy Living Defense (MOLD) Act, introduced Jan. 15 in the House (bill number pending) and Senate (S. 3654), would create enforceable safety standards for privatized housing and require inspections and reporting to prevent hazardous living conditions. It would also hold private companies accountable when they put families at risk.

[TAKE ACTION: Send a Letter to Congress in Support of the MOLD Act]

Lead sponsors are Sens. Richard Blumenthal (D-Conn.) and Tim Sheehy (R-Mont.), along with Reps. Jimmy Panetta (D-Calif.), Gus Bilirakis (R-Fla), and James Moylan (R.-Guam). Original cosponsors also include Sens. Joni Ernst (R-Iowa) and Mazie Hirono (D-Hawaii).

“Accountability is essential when neglect and inadequate maintenance result in hazardous military housing conditions,” said MOAA President and CEO Lt. Gen. Brian T. Kelly, USAF (Ret). “Servicemembers and their families should not have to sacrifice their health or well-being due to substandard housing.”

MOAA joined lawmakers and advocates at a Jan. 15 press conference in support of the legislation. Military families – with their young children holding signs and flanking the podium – shared devastating firsthand accounts.

“Our home was contaminated with toxic mold,” said Erica Thompson, a military spouse whose family was stationed at Maxwell Air Force Base, Ala. “We lost our family dog, we lost most of our belongings, and our children lost their health. As a result of that exposure, all five of our children are now medically disqualified to serve in the military.”

Her children’s diagnoses included brain inflammation, asthma, postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome (POTS), and pediatric cataracts. Thompson, now working as a volunteer advocate, has met many families across the country suffering from toxic exposures in their military homes.

“These are not isolated incidents,” she said. “This is a systemic failure.”

About 700,000 currently serving and family members are affected by hazardous conditions in their military-provided housing, Blumenthal’s office reports.

If approved, the MOLD Act would establish:

Standardized requirements for acceptable humidity levels.

Third-party inspections upon tenant turnover and complaints.

A 24/7 complaint hotline and website for hazard reporting.

Penalties for noncompliance, to include withholding bonuses to landlords and refunds of a tenant’s Basic Allowance for Housing.

A dedicated Pentagon oversight office.

“This bipartisan, bicameral reform deserves quick passage so servicemembers and their families have a safe place to call home,” Blumenthal said.

Moylan said the problem has been permitted to fester “too long.”

“The MOLD Act finally establishes enforceable standards, independent inspections, and real accountability for contractors who fail our servicemembers,” he said.",https://www.moaa.org/contentassets/6195e7ceb57e41c79fff26dd6b4963a2/mold-act-presser-h.jpg,N,-1.0,2026-01-21 19:56:36.938909

DOJ Reports Record FY 2025 False Claims Act Recoveries Exceeding $6.8 Billion

The US Department of Justice (DOJ) announced a record $6.8 billion in False Claims Act (FCA) settlements and judgments for fiscal year 2025, the highest recovery in a single year in the history of the FCA. This year, whistleblowers filed a record 1,297 qui tam lawsuits and the government opened 401 investigations. Health care fraud was the leading source of FCA settlements and judgments, accounting for over $5.7 billion related to recoveries to restore funds to federal programs such as Medicare, Medicaid, and TRICARE. In addition to health care fraud, the DOJ pursued cases involving government procurement, contractor cybersecurity obligations, and pandemic program fraud. The DOJ also directed resources to combatting fraud that evades tariffs and customs duties by launching a cross-agency Trade Fraud Task Force to enhance efforts to prevent trade fraud.

This is all according to a press release and fact sheet published by the DOJ on January 16, available here.

DOJ to Launch National Fraud Enforcement Division

On January 8, the Trump Administration announced plans to create a new US Department of Justice (DOJ) division focused on national fraud enforcement. The division will enforce federal criminal and civil laws against fraud targeting government programs, federally funded benefits, businesses, nonprofits, and private citizens.

The Assistant Attorney General (AAG) for this new division will oversee multi-district and multi-agency investigations, set national enforcement priorities, and advise the Attorney General and Deputy Attorney General on high-impact fraud investigations. The AAG will also provide assistance and directions to the US Attorneys’ Offices on fraud related issues. The announcement also highlighted that the AAG will propose legislative and regulatory reforms that they believe are “necessary to close systemic vulnerabilities.”

Atlantic Biologicals Enters Into DPA Over Opioid Scheme

On January 13, the DOJ announced that Atlantic Biologicals Corporation entered into a two-year deferred prosecution agreement (DPA) after being charged with conspiring to distribute controlled substances. Under the DPA, Atlantic Biologicals admitted that its National Apothecary Solutions (NAS) unit knowingly sold millions of oxycodone, hydrocodone, hydromorphone, and other controlled substances like carisoprodol and alprazolam to Houston, Texas-area pill mills from 2017 to May 2023. According to the government, the pills were dispensed outside the usual course of professional practice and without a legitimate medical purpose. NAS realized at least $2,508,735.85 in gross proceeds from these sales and sold over 14 million doses of opioids and opioid potentiators. The NAS will cease operations this month. Several individuals tied to the scheme, including a former NAS president and affiliated consultants, previously pleaded guilty.

According to court documents, NAS used purported compliance measures that were circumvented while ignoring clear red flags, including abnormal ordering patterns, willingness to pay above market prices, suspicious pharmacy operations, and sham due diligence. According to the DPA, Atlantic Biologicals must cooperate with the DOJ, implement a compliance and ethics program, and report to the DOJ on remediation. Atlantic Biologicals will also pay a $450,000 criminal penalty. According to the DOJ, while Atlantic Biologicals did not timely self-disclose its misconduct to the DOJ, they did receive credit for cooperating with the government’s investigation.

Medical Supply Company Charged for Alleged $30 Million Health Care Fraud

Federal prosecutors charged Mark Loftis, owner of Back Pain Home Supplies LLC doing business as EZ Medical Supply, with orchestrating a scheme to submit fraudulent claims to Medicare, TRICARE, and CHAMPVA for orthotic braces and other durable medical equipment (DME), and for theft of Provider Relief Funds (PRF) intended to support health care providers during the COVID-19 pandemic. According to the indictment, which was recently unsealed, Loftis paid illegal kickbacks to marketers in exchange for Medicare patient referrals and to marketers and telemedicine companies in exchange for signed doctors’ orders without meaningful patient evaluations. He then allegedly billed for medically unnecessary DME that was not provided as billed. Back Pain allegedly submitted approximately $30 million in false claims, of which the health care programs paid approximately $8 million.

Loftis is also accused of misusing over $133,000 in PRF money by falsely attesting to certain conditions and diverting funds to further the DME fraud scheme and for personal expenses. He is charged with conspiracy to commit health care fraud and wire fraud, conspiracy to defraud the United States and to offer, pay, solicit, and receive kickbacks, and two counts of theft of government property. If convicted, he faces up to 20 years in prison on the health care and wire fraud conspiracy count, five years on the conspiracy and kickback count, and 10 years on each theft of government property count.

An indictment is merely an allegation. All defendants are presumed innocent until proven guilty beyond a reasonable doubt in a court of law.

Kaiser Affiliates to Pay $556 Million for Alleged False Claims Act Violations

Affiliates of Kaiser Permanente (collectively, “Kaiser”), an integrated health care consortium, agreed to pay $556 million to resolve allegations that they violated the FCA by submitting invalid diagnosis codes for Medicare Advantage Plan enrollees in order to obtain higher payments from the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS). Under the Medicare Advantage (MA) Program, beneficiaries may opt out of traditional Medicare and enroll in private health plans offered by Medicare Advantage Organizations (MAOs). Kaiser owns and operates MAOs that offer MA plans to beneficiaries throughout the United States.

The government alleged that from 2009 to 2018, in California and Colorado, Kaiser systematically pressured physicians to add diagnoses to patient medical records that physicians had not addressed after patient visits were completed, which violated CMS rules. According to the allegations, Kaiser developed systems to mine patient histories for potential unsubmitted diagnoses and sent their providers queries urging them to add new diagnoses via addenda to patient medical records months or over a year after the related patient visits. The government also alleged that Kaiser set aggressive physician and facility targets tied to financial incentives. The government further alleged Kaiser knew the practices were unlawful and ignored red flags raised by its own physicians.

The civil settlement also resolves claims in related qui tam FCA cases brought by former Kaiser employees, Ronda Osinek and James M. Taylor, M.D. The relator share of the recovery will be $95 million.

The claims resolved by the settlement are allegations and there has been no determination of liability.

20 People Charged With Alleged Sports Bribery Scheme to Fix NCAA and CBA Basketball Games

On January 14, federal prosecutors in the Eastern District of Pennsylvania charged 20 college basketball players with a massive sports bribery scheme intended to influence Chinese Basketball Association (CBA) and National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) men’s basketball games. Prosecutors alleged violations of 18 U.S.C. § 224 (bribery in sporting contests), § 1349 (conspiracy to commit wire fraud), § 1343 (wire fraud), and § 2 (aiding and abetting). According to the indictment, from about September 2022 through February 2025, a group of individuals called “fixers” used bribes to induce CBA players to underperform in order to “point shave” so that their opponents would win and wagers placed on those winning teams would succeed. The scheme allegedly began with fixed CBA games and then expanded into NCAA games.

Prosecutors allege that the NCAA component ultimately involved more than 39 players across over 17 Division I men’s basketball teams and affected over 29 NCAA Division I men’s basketball games. The fixers allegedly made wagers totaling millions of dollars on the games and generated substantial proceeds for both the fixers and the other players involved in the games. According to the indictment, the fixers and players collectively received hundreds of thousands of dollars in bribe payments for fixing their teams’ games, with a typical payment between $10,000-$30,000 per game per player. For their scheme, the fixers allegedly targeted NCAA basketball players for whom the bribe payments would meaningfully supplement or exceed legitimate name, image, and likeness opportunities.

The new year brings both opportunity and challenge, especially when it comes to advancing legislation and protecting service-earned benefits. MOAA has been building and refining its advocacy strategy to hold the line in 2026.

Before addressing what’s to come this year, it’s important to take stock of what was accomplished in 2025.

Delivering Wins for the Uniformed Services Community

In December, MOAA was recognized by The Hill as a Top Lobbyist for the 19th year in a row. Our grassroots advocacy helped advance a targeted pay raise for junior enlisted servicemembers, defend protections for student-veterans against fraud, and expand TRICARE coverage for an Alzheimer’s medication.

[READ MORE: MOAA Again Recognized as a ‘Top Lobbyist’ by The Hill]

MOAA’s advocacy also helped secure several additional policy wins in 2025 that directly affect quality of life: The Fairness for Servicemembers and Their Families Act became law, for example, protecting VA insurance programs from inflation. And MOAA’s advocacy on unaccompanied housing and housing allowances contributed to their inclusions in a broad reconciliation package passed in July.

The FY 2026 National Defense Authorization Act, which became law late last year, also included key MOAA-supported quality-of-life provisions, such as:

Protections against future medical billet cuts and harmful restructuring of military treatment facilities.

Expanded child care fee assistance.

Increased Family Separation Allowance.

Improved Pentagon-VA collaboration on toxic exposures.

New reporting requirements on unreimbursed PCS costs.

Enhanced oversight of the TRICARE contract transition.

These outcomes reflect MOAA’s commitment to protecting service-earned benefits and addressing challenges faced by today’s military families.

Powered by Grassroots Advocacy

MOAA’s success is driven not only by policy expertise, but by the strength of its members.

We are privileged to represent more than 350,000 members advocating on behalf of all servicemembers, veterans, surviving spouses, and families.

In 2025, MOAA members sent more than 105,000 messages to Congress through our Legislative Action Center in support of key initiatives. By year’s end, MOAA’s advocacy community included more than 32,000 registered advocates, with council and chapter members serving as key grassroots leaders. Their work mobilizing local chapters, engaging lawmakers, and leading advocacy on state-specific issues is essential.

Before supporting legislation, lawmakers want to hear directly from their constituents. Grassroots voices make clear that these issues matter not just in Washington, but in their home districts.

[RELATED: MOAA.org/Chapters]

Looking Ahead to 2026

The second half of the 119th Congress will be pivotal for MOAA’s advocacy mission.

Building support and awareness is central to the legislative process. Many bills introduced in the first year of a congressional session do not gain momentum or move toward passage until the second year. Several of MOAA’s highest-priority bills, which were introduced during the first year of the 119th Congress, must advance this year or face a steeper path to be reintroduced.

As always, your engagement will be essential as we continue to advocate for MOAA’s priorities in 2026.

“After a four-week trial, the jury found that Omnicare and CVS billed Medicare, Medicaid, and TRICARE for over three million false claims.
“The Department’s False Claims Act enforcement is guided by a simple principle: the statute is a powerful tool, and it should be used responsibly.
But just as important, in many cases, enforcement of the False Claims Act also protects patients from medically unnecessary or potentially harmful conduct,” the department said.
Among other examples of False Claims Act matters pursued by the government and whistleblowers in fiscal year 2025, shared in the fact sheet:","The Department of Justice saw more than $6.8 billion in settlements and judgments under the False Claims Act in fiscal year 2025, the department said Friday. A big part of that amount was the $949 million judgment, including treble damages and penalties, against long-term care pharmacy Omnicare that was awarded in a senior living-related case, the department indicated in materials detailing the judgments and settlements.

“A unanimous jury found Omnicare, the country’s largest long-term care pharmacy, and its parent CVS liable for fraudulently dispensing drugs without valid prescriptions to elderly and disabled people in assisted living facilities and other residential long-term care facilities,” the Justice Department said in the fact sheet. “After a four-week trial, the jury found that Omnicare and CVS billed Medicare, Medicaid, and TRICARE for over three million false claims. In August 2025, the court entered a judgment including treble damages and penalties for a total amount of $948.8 million.”

Omnicare filed an appeal in the case in September, but that appeal was put on hold after the company filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy later that month. In December, a federal bankruptcy court paved the way for the company to proceed with a bankruptcy sale, setting Jan. 31 as the deadline for stalking horse agreements and additional dates in March and April.

Highest amount in a single year

The $6.8 billion in settlements and judgments is the highest amount in a single year in the history of the False Claims Act, according to the Justice Department. In FY 2025, which ended Sept. 30, whistleblowers filed 1,297 qui tam lawsuits, the highest number in a single year, and the government opened 401 investigations. Settlements and judgments since 1986 now total more than $85 billion, according to the department.

“The False Claims Act is at its best when it protects taxpayers and the Americans who rely on government programs,” Deputy Assistant Attorney General Brenna Jenny of the Justice Department’s Civil Division said in a statement Friday. “The Department’s False Claims Act enforcement is guided by a simple principle: the statute is a powerful tool, and it should be used responsibly. The record-breaking recoveries announced today show our commitment to holding bad actors accountable, safeguarding taxpayer dollars, and protecting vulnerable populations.”

Healthcare fraud remained a leading source of False Claims Act settlements and judgments, representing more than $5.7 billion of the $6.8 billion total.

“These recoveries restore funds to federal programs such as Medicare, Medicaid, and TRICARE, the healthcare program for service members and their families. But just as important, in many cases, enforcement of the False Claims Act also protects patients from medically unnecessary or potentially harmful conduct,” the department said.

We sought to understand the impact of these events on MHS beneficiary care by comparing Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ) Prevention Quality Indicators (PQIs) for avoidable hospitalizations between beneficiaries with a designated direct care primary care manager (PCM) and those with a designated private sector PCM.

Materials and methods: We used the MHS Data Repository to conduct a cross-sectional study of TRICARE Prime beneficiaries aged 18 to 64 years during fiscal years 2021-2024. Crude and adjusted risk ratios were used to determine risk by PCM type for each AHRQ PQI. Logistic regression models were used to estimate unadjusted and adjusted odds ratios for admissions for any of the PQIs. This study was found exempt by the Institutional Review Board of the Uniformed Services University of the Health Sciences.

Results: We identified a total of 490,236 hospital admissions by patients in the MHS with a designated primary care manager (PCM) during the study period. Of the total admissions, 2.85% were associated with PQIs, 2.70% by direct care PCM at a military treatment facility, and 3.75% by a private sector PCM.

For military communities, One Health means taking a team approach to prevent diseases, ensure food safety, and protect service members and their families.
Deployment health protection When service members deploy, they may face unique health challenges that civilian communities rarely encounter.
Military working dogs The One Health approach also benefits the health and welfare of military working dogs.
By working across traditional boundaries, military health professionals can identify threats earlier, respond more effectively, and protect service members and their families more completely.","When a military working dog gets sick overseas, the issue can involve more than just animal health. When service members deploy to regions with different diseases, there are more than just human health hazards to consider. When food safety becomes a problem at a military dining facility, the cause could be germs originating from humans, animals, or the environment. These interconnected health challenges require an integrated solution, and that's where One Health comes in.

""I prefer to think of One Health as integrated public health, working collaboratively across multiple disciplines,"" said Dr. Kristina McElroy, Veterinary Defense Support of Civil Authorities and interagency coordinator, Veterinary Services Division, Defense Health Agency-Public Health in Falls Church, Virginia. “This transdisciplinary approach guides my daily work as a veterinarian in DHA-Public Health.”

This collaborative approach is protecting military communities worldwide by recognizing that human health, animal health, and environmental health are closely connected.

What is One Health?

One Health is a simple but powerful idea: The health of people, animals, and the environment are linked. When one area has a problem, it can affect the others. For military communities, One Health means taking a team approach to prevent diseases, ensure food safety, and protect service members and their families.

Deployment health protection

When service members deploy, they may face unique health challenges that civilian communities rarely encounter. Service members travel frequently, encounter or work with animals, and deploy to regions with different risks of infectious disease.

According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, zoonotic diseases are caused by germs that spread between animals and people, and are caused by harmful germs like viruses, bacterial parasites, and fungi.

""Different vectors may be present that increase risk of certain zoonotic diseases, so we consider different parasite prevention and sometimes different daily management practices to limit exposure,"" said Lt. Col. Crystal Doyle, chief of animal medicine, Veterinary Services Division, DHA-Public Health. ""We must also be familiar with differing requirements for reportable diseases in the various countries in which we work.""

This global perspective is also essential for protecting military families. When service members deploy to different regions, they may encounter diseases that aren’t prevalent in their home stations. One Health approaches help identify these risks early and develop prevention strategies.

The benefits of One Health aren't theoretical; they're saving lives and protecting military operations every day, said McElroy.

""During outbreaks of highly pathogenic avian influenza, chikungunya, Zika, as well as COVID-19 — which are all zoonotic diseases — the collaborative interdisciplinary approach of One Health has protected service members' health,"" said McElroy. ""Veterinary Services has worked hand in hand with colleagues at the Armed Forces Health Surveillance Division, the military services and U.S. government agencies to ensure guidance and recommendations are coordinated and appropriate for the military population.""

The One Health approach also benefits the health and welfare of military working dogs. MWDs are valuable team members who can be affected by zoonotic diseases that can also affect service members.

""There have been MWD kennels with multiple dogs affected by similar clinical signs and symptoms that pointed to a possible zoonotic disease,"" said Doyle. ""While testing was pending to determine a definitive diagnosis, operational tempo was decreased to limit human exposure to the suspected zoonotic disease.""

Military veterinarians also submit ticks from their patients for disease screening, or disease confirmation if a patient is suspected of being infected, said Doyle.

“We routinely submit blood samples from our MWD population to screen for tick-borne diseases, many of which are also found in the human population (such as Lyme disease).”

Food Safety Protection

Food safety is a key part of the One Health mission, as military dining facilities serve thousands of meals daily.

""The military uses a multidisciplinary, multiservice, and interagency approach to analyze food safety and security from a One Health perspective,"" said Lt. Col. Melissa Hehr, deputy chief, Veterinary Services Division, DHA-Public Health. ""This requires close coordination amongst agencies and military services with responsibilities for food procurement, food protection, food sanitation, preventive medicine, public health, diagnostic laboratory, policy, and regulatory functions.""

Global health security benefits

One Health approaches don't just protect individual service members; they strengthen global health security for everyone.

""One Health initiatives leverage unique military capabilities to contribute to the United States' global health security efforts,"" said McElroy. ""Specifically for veterinary services, the DOW (Department of War) provides training to veterinarians and public health professionals in partner nations, strengthening their capacity to prevent and respond to disease outbreaks.""

The military also helps strengthen public health infrastructure worldwide, including laboratories, surveillance systems, and disease reporting networks that benefit both military and civilian populations, said McElroy.

Monitoring emerging threats

Military veterinarians, physicians, environmental health specialists, and public health experts work together using One Health principles. This teamwork helps identify health threats early and respond more effectively than any single group could. An example of this type of collaboration can be found in how these teams are managing the threat of New World screwworm.

“There is currently ongoing collaboration between military veterinary, medical, biosurveillance, and pest management teams to monitor and prepare for a potential incursion of New World screwworm into the United States,” said Hehr. “This flesh-eating parasite is actually a perfect example of a One Health problem where an integrative approach is being used to analyze, monitor, and mitigate the threat posed to human, animal, and environmental health, as well as military operations, food and agriculture, and national security.”

Overcoming challenges

Implementing One Health approaches in military settings requires overcoming unique challenges.

""I think the greatest challenge to implementing a One Health approach lies in our ability to develop a mutual understanding of the capabilities, responsibilities, and authorities of the various organizations and entities that are required for effective One Health integration under different contexts,"" said Hehr.

Military health teams work to build these relationships through various communication methods, including news articles, information papers, social media posts, email, meetings, webinars, and educational courses, said Hehr.

Working together for health

The success of One Health depends on collaboration across different specialties and organizations.

""At DHA Veterinary Services, we strive for collaborative communication and integration across the joint force and entire DOW,"" McElroy explains.

This teamwork includes partnerships among military veterinarians, human health professionals, environmental specialists, and public health experts from all service branches. The approach is proactive rather than reactive.

By working across traditional boundaries, military health professionals can identify threats earlier, respond more effectively, and protect service members and their families more completely. As health threats become more complex and global, One Health approaches become more important for protecting military communities.

The 1.5 million troops who received an unexpected $1,776 so-called “warrior dividend” payment in December won’t have to pay taxes on that money, the Internal Revenue Service has confirmed.

In a Dec. 17 speech, President Donald Trump announced the payments, which he described as a “warrior dividend,” would be made to 1.5 million troops, and said they were funded by revenue from tariffs and $2.9 billion in the One Big Beautiful Bill Act enacted last July. The Associated Press later reported that the payments weren’t being funded by tariffs.

Active-duty service members in pay grades O-6 and below, and eligible Reserve Component members, received the payments, which were described by the Pentagon as “supplemental basic allowance for housing payments.”

The IRS said in a release Friday that basic allowance for housing payments are “qualified military benefits,” and are specifically excluded from gross income in federal tax law, so they are not taxable.

“The tax-free Warrior Dividend places $1,776 directly in the hands of our warfighters and their families,” Pentagon press secretary Kingsley Wilson said in a Defense Department release Friday.

According to the IRS website, the agency will start accepting tax returns Jan. 26. The deadline to file federal tax returns for 2025, and to pay any taxes due, is April 15, although there are certain extensions available for service members, such as those stationed or deployed overseas.

Federal W-2 tax statements are scheduled to be available on DOD’s myPay site Wednesday for active-duty Army, Navy, Air Force and Space Force. They are already available for active and Reserve Marine Corps; Reserve Army, Navy, Air Force and Space Force members; and military retirees. But Defense Finance and Accounting Service officials note that system maintenance scheduled for Wednesday could affect account functionality between 10 a.m. and 4 p.m. Eastern Standard Time.

Service members and their families have access to free military-specific tax preparation software through MilTax, as well as free one-on-one help by tax consultants, all provided through Military OneSource. Those eligible can file their federal return and up to five state returns for free. Active-duty service members, eligible family members, survivors and recent veterans up to 365 days after their separation or retirement date can file their taxes for free through this benefit.

A recent Ninth Circuit decision did not foreclose the government’s case because the government alleged incentives to increase both the value and volume of prescriptions, regardless of patient need.

The federal government sufficiently pleaded violations of the Anti-Kickback Statute (AKS), 42 U.S.C. § 1320a-7b(b), in connection with an allegedly unlawful referral scheme for compounded prescriptions, held the federal district court in Las Vegas, Nevada. The complaint contained sufficient factual matter about unnecessary medications, accepted as true, to state a facially plausible and particularized claim. The complaint contained enough details of false claims, paired with reliable indicia, to draw an inference that false claims were actually submitted and to provide sufficient notice to defend. Among other details, the pharmacy and its owners allegedly had scienter to the extent they did not collect TRICARE and CHAMPVA copays. The complaint also pleaded a quid pro quo arrangement providing the necessary link element under the AKS. Congruent with a recent Ninth Circuit decision, the government alleged incentives to increase both the value and volume of prescriptions, regardless of patient need. Apart from dismissal of the unjust enrichment claim, where the AKS provides an adequate remedy at law, the court denied the responding pharmacy parties’ motion to dismiss (United States of America v. PCPLV LLC, No. 2:21-cv-00184-GMN-DJA (D. Nev. Jan. 13, 2026)).

Background. The federal government complained of alleged kickback schemes between marketers, physicians, and a compounding pharmacy. The government said the pharmacy paid substantial kickbacks to various third-party marketers in exchange for compounded drug prescription referrals. The pharmacy billed patient insurers including TRICARE and CHAMPVA (Civilian Health and Medical Program of the Department of Veterans Affairs). Alleged violations of the Anti-Kickback Statute (AKS), 42 U.S.C. § 1320a-7b(b), often paid in cash, formed the basis for the government’s claim under the False Claims Act (FCA), 31 U.S.C. § 3729, et seq. The pharmacy also allegedly entered into kickback arrangements with physicians directly. The physicians allegedly issued prescriptions for compounded medications for TRICARE and CHAMPVA beneficiaries without ever establishing a physician-patient relationship and usually without the required co-pays. The government claimed: (1) violation of the FCA based on violations of the AKS; (2) payment by mistake; and (3) unjust enrichment.

The pharmacy parties, marketers, and physicians (collectively, the pharmacy parties) moved to dismiss all claims for failure to state a claim per Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(b)(6). They argued: (1) the complaint did not satisfy R. 9(b) particularity; (2) the complaint did not plead the elements of an FCA claim under R. 9(b) and R. 12(b)(6); (3) the complaint did not sufficiently plead state law claims under R. 9(b) and R. 12(b)(6).

Particularized pleading. After analyzing each of the pharmacy parties’ six arguments for dismissal under R. 9(b), the court held the complaint pleaded fraud with the required particularity.

First, although one paragraph of the complaint was based on “information and belief,” the next two paragraphs provided a factual basis in the form of two tables purporting to show specific alleged kickback payments.

Second, the FCA claim alleged the disputed prescriptions were unnecessary. The complaint described in some detail the filling of prescriptions for three patients. The practices described supported an inference the prescriptions were unnecessary because the patients allegedly neither requested the prescriptions nor understood why they were prescribed. Although there is no categorical Medicare requirement that physicians see a patient in-person for a prescription to be reimbursable, the complaint alleged the physicians in question did not even speak with the people in question. The complaint alleged the absence of a physician-patient relationship. The complaint contained sufficient factual matter about the unnecessary medications, accepted as true, to state a facially plausible and particularized claim.

Third, the court disagreed with the pharmacy parties that the limited examples of alleged fraud lacked required particularity. The court reviewed how the Ninth Circuit has held that complaints do not necessarily have to identify every detail of a specific claim, but they must contain enough details of false claims paired with reliable indicia to draw an inference that false claims were actually submitted. Notice of the alleged fraudulent conduct necessary to defend was enough. The complaint in this case described the alleged kickback scheme, and the government pointed to an example about a “consulting fee agreement” confined to compounded prescriptions, an example the court found illustrative and meeting the particularity standard.

Fourth, the government did allege sufficiently particular details of a per se false claim scheme in violation of the AKS, albeit without identifying any specific false claims, paired with reliable indicia in the form of tables, which could support a strong inference that false claims were actually submitted. The government met Ninth Circuit R. 9(b) pleading obligations for FCA claims.

Fifth, as to whether the complaint impermissibly lumped the defendants together for individual liability, the court found the complaint pleaded with particularity the role and action of each named respondent. The complaint provided sufficient differentiation for notice to each.

Sixth, the court addressed similar arguments about a specific responding entity and concluded the government’s complaint was not ambiguous based on similar reasoning it already discussed.

FCA elements. The pharmacy parties argued the complaint did not sufficiently plead the elements of an FCA claim predicated on AKS violations, but the court found all elements satisfied.

First, the FCA requires scienter, a knowing and willful act, but a person need not have actual knowledge of the AKS itself. The pharmacy parties argued the complaint lacked requisite scienter, but the court found the complaint provided “many examples” of scienter satisfying the AKS and FCA. The complaint pleaded the physicians prescribed compounded prescriptions without a physician-patient relationship, even to patients who said they did not want a certain prescription. The pharmacy and its owners allegedly had scienter to the extent they did not collect TRICARE and CHAMPVA copays, received inquiries asking why patients received medications they did not request, and did not discard returned medications. The court described examples of putative actual knowledge at length. Each, if proved, would satisfy AKS scienter.

As for the required element of a connection between the alleged kickback scheme and false claims, the AKS generally does not require proof of a quid pro quo. The court said Ninth Circuit courts have declined to adopt the Sixth and Eighth Circuits’ “but-for” causation standard the pharmacy parties urged. A third circuit case the pharmacy relied on described the standard at the summary judgment stage, not the pleading stage, and courts are currently split on what constitutes causation under the AKS.

The instant court said there only need be a link, as in cases where the doctor who actually received an alleged kickback uses a respondent’s services. The instant complaint pleaded a quid pro quo arrangement providing the necessary link. The pharmacy would allegedly pay the marketers directly tied to the volume and value of prescription referrals allegedly induced from the physicians without a bona fide patient-doctor relationship.

As to whether the complaint failed to allege that any payment recipient had the authority to unduly influence or select a medical provider, the pharmacy asked the court to consider a Fifth Circuit case distinguishing between intent to induce “referrals,” which is illegal, and intent to compensate advertisers, which is permissible. However, the instant court found the complaint here supported an inference of kickbacks due to prohibited undue influence after the pharmacy submitted a successful false claim.

The pharmacy parties further cited to United States v. Schena, 142 F. 4th 1217 (9th Cir. 2025) for the proposition that it foreclosed the government’s theory of per se AKS violation through payment of a percentage-based compensation structure consisting of volume-based sales commissions to independent sales representatives who then promoted the pharmacy’s services to prescribing physicians. The instant court distinguished that the Schena court considered the Eliminating Kickbacks in Recovery Act (EKRA) statute, not the AKS, albeit Schena analogized to the relevant AKS provision here. However, Schena did not foreclose the government’s case because the government alleged incentives to increase both the value and volume of prescriptions, regardless of patient need, in satisfaction of Schena. To whatever extent Schena’s interpretation of EKRA applied to the AKS, Schena did not foreclose the government’s claims here.

As for the element of materiality, the pharmacy parties argued the complaint only assumed materiality, but the court noted courts following the Escobar standard have held AKS violations are per se material. See Universal Health Services, Inc. v. United States ex rel. Escobar, 579 U.S. 176 (2016). The court found the materiality requirement satisfied for pleading purposes.

Unjust enrichment. The court granted dismissal of the government’s unjust enrichment claim because an adequate remedy at law appeared to be available under the FCA, and the government did not address this argument. The court also ruled amendment would be futile, so it dismissed the unjust enrichment claim with prejudice.

Mistaken payment. The pharmacy parties argued the court should dismiss the government’s payment by mistake claim because the complaint did not describe any specific mistaken belief by the government, apart from implying that the government made payments without knowledge of the alleged kickbacks. The pharmacy parties argued the government should detail what the mistake was and how it impacted payment, but the court denied dismissal here because they did not cite any authority in support of dismissal.

The case is No. 2:21-cv-00184-GMN-DJA.

Because of this shared nerve pathway, the brain can misinterpret heart pain as dental pain.
Real Case Example One well-known case involved a 56-year-old man who visited his dentist complaining of persistent lower jaw pain on the left side.
Studies show that gum disease is associated with increased risk of heart disease due to chronic inflammation.
For TRICARE patients and US military families in the UK, having clear support makes a real difference.","Problem: Toothache Is Usually Ignored as “Just a Dental Issue”

A toothache is one of the most common pains people experience. Most of the time, it is blamed on cavities, gum infection, or wisdom teeth. People reach for painkillers, rinse with salt water, or delay seeing a dentist.

That approach usually works.

But in rare cases, a toothache—especially in the lower jaw—may have nothing to do with the teeth at all. It can be a warning sign of something far more serious: a heart attack.

This connection surprises many people. The heart and the teeth seem completely unrelated. Yet medical research and real-world case studies show that cardiac pain can sometimes show up in the jaw, teeth, or face.

Missing this sign can be dangerous.

Why This Matters

Heart disease is the leading cause of death worldwide. According to the World Health Organization, cardiovascular diseases cause an estimated 17.9 million deaths each year. Many of these deaths happen because early warning signs are ignored or misunderstood.

Chest pain is the most well-known symptom of a heart attack. But not everyone gets chest pain. Some people—especially women, older adults, and people with diabetes—experience unusual symptoms instead.

One of those unusual symptoms can be tooth or jaw pain.

Impact: When Tooth Pain Is Not Coming From the Tooth

Heart-related toothache is known as referred pain. This happens when pain from one part of the body is felt in another area.

The nerves that supply the heart also connect with nerves in the jaw, neck, and left arm. Because of this shared nerve pathway, the brain can misinterpret heart pain as dental pain.

This creates a serious problem.

A person may feel strong pain in the lower teeth or jaw, assume it is a dental issue, and delay medical help. Meanwhile, the heart muscle may be losing oxygen.

What Research Shows

A study published in the Journal of the American Dental Association reported cases where patients visited dentists for severe tooth pain, but dental exams showed no clear cause. Later, these patients were diagnosed with heart problems, including myocardial infarction (heart attack).

Another clinical review found that up to 40% of patients with heart attacks experience pain outside the chest, including the jaw, teeth, neck, or face.

These are not rare coincidences. They are documented medical events.

Real Case Example

One well-known case involved a 56-year-old man who visited his dentist complaining of persistent lower jaw pain on the left side. X-rays showed no cavities, infections, or gum disease. The pain did not change with chewing or temperature.

The dentist referred him to a physician. An ECG and blood tests later confirmed he was experiencing an ongoing heart attack. Immediate treatment prevented major heart damage.

Without that referral, the outcome could have been fatal.

Warning Signs That Make Toothache More Concerning

A heart-related toothache often looks different from a normal dental problem. Red flags include:

Pain in the lower jaw or left side of the face

Tooth pain with no visible dental cause

Pain that feels deep, dull, or pressure-like

Toothache combined with shortness of breath

Pain along with sweating, nausea, or dizziness

Jaw pain that comes with physical activity or stress

Pain that does not improve with painkillers

If tooth pain appears with any of these symptoms, it should not be ignored.

Why Dentists and Doctors Take This Seriously

Modern dentistry does not work in isolation from general health. Dentists are trained to recognize when pain does not match dental findings.

Several dental case studies highlight the importance of ruling out heart issues when unexplained jaw pain appears. In some reported cases, dentists were the first healthcare professionals to suspect heart disease.

This is especially important for patients who already have risk factors such as:

High blood pressure

Diabetes

Smoking history

High cholesterol

Family history of heart disease

Obesity

For these patients, unusual pain should raise concern.

Solution: How to Respond to Toothache That Feels “Different”

The goal is not to create fear. Most toothaches are dental in origin. Cavities, abscesses, and gum disease remain the most common causes.

But awareness saves lives.

What Patients Should Do

If you experience tooth or jaw pain, ask yourself:

Is this pain different from past toothaches?

Is there swelling, decay, or gum infection?

Does the pain come with chest tightness or breathlessness?

Does it worsen with walking or climbing stairs?

If the answer to these questions raises concern, seek medical help immediately. Call emergency services rather than waiting for a dental appointment.

What Dentists Do

When dentists see jaw or tooth pain without a clear dental cause, responsible practice includes:

Taking a detailed medical history

Asking about chest discomfort and breathing

Checking for risk factors

Referring the patient to a physician when needed

This collaborative approach between dentistry and medicine prevents delayed diagnosis.

Prevention: Reducing the Risk Before Symptoms Appear

The link between oral health and heart health goes beyond toothache. Studies show that gum disease is associated with increased risk of heart disease due to chronic inflammation.

Good prevention includes:

Regular dental check-ups

Managing gum disease early

Controlling blood pressure and blood sugar

Quitting smoking

Staying physically active

Following heart-healthy diets

Prevention reduces confusion between dental pain and medical emergencies.

Final Thoughts: Toothache Is Usually Simple—But Sometimes It Is Not

A toothache is usually just a toothache. But in rare cases, it can be the body’s way of signaling a heart problem.

Medical literature and real case studies confirm that heart attacks can present as jaw or tooth pain, especially when no dental cause is found.

Knowing this connection helps patients act faster and helps dentists make safer decisions.

When pain does not make sense, do not ignore it.

Imagine being able to schedule, change, or even cancel appointments at your convenience—all from the comfort of your home. This platform streamlines access to military hospitals and clinics, making the often complicated process of managing medical care feel like a breeze.

For active duty members and their dependents, Tricare offers various programs tailored to meet diverse needs. Whether you’re stationed stateside or overseas, understanding how to navigate these options can significantly impact your family’s health journey. For instance, did you know that reservists and National Guard members also have unique benefits under Tricare? It’s essential for service members and their families to be aware of what they are entitled to—after all, knowledge is power when it comes to healthcare.

One standout feature of Tricare Online is its ability to facilitate mental health services through partnerships with platforms like Talkspace. With this integration, eligible beneficiaries can connect with licensed therapists without the hassle of long wait times or out-of-network costs. Just imagine having access to therapy sessions via text or video chat while balancing life as a military spouse or dependent! The flexibility offered by online therapy means that support is always within reach.

But let’s not overlook some common misconceptions surrounding these services. Many believe that registering with programs such as the Exceptional Family Member Program (EFMP) could hinder career advancement for service members—a rumor worth dispelling if it prevents families from accessing necessary resources.

As we explore further into what Tricare Online has in store for users—from appointment management tools designed specifically for busy lives filled with deployments and relocations—to comprehensive mental health support—it becomes clear that this platform aims not only at efficiency but also at enhancing overall well-being among military populations.

Atlantic Biologicals Enters Into DPA Over Opioid Scheme

On January 13, the DOJ announced that Atlantic Biologicals Corporation entered into a two-year deferred prosecution agreement (DPA) after being charged with conspiring to distribute controlled substances. Under the DPA, Atlantic Biologicals admitted that its National Apothecary Solutions (NAS) unit knowingly sold millions of oxycodone, hydrocodone, hydromorphone, and other controlled substances like carisoprodol and alprazolam to Houston, Texas-area pill mills from 2017 to May 2023. According to the government, the pills were dispensed outside the usual course of professional practice and without a legitimate medical purpose. NAS realized at least $2,508,735.85 in gross proceeds from these sales and sold over 14 million doses of opioids and opioid potentiators. The NAS will cease operations this month. Several individuals tied to the scheme, including a former NAS president and affiliated consultants, previously pleaded guilty.

According to court documents, NAS used purported compliance measures that were circumvented while ignoring clear red flags, including abnormal ordering patterns, willingness to pay above market prices, suspicious pharmacy operations, and sham due diligence. According to the DPA, Atlantic Biologicals must cooperate with the DOJ, implement a compliance and ethics program, and report to the DOJ on remediation. Atlantic Biologicals will also pay a $450,000 criminal penalty. According to the DOJ, while Atlantic Biologicals did not timely self-disclose its misconduct to the DOJ, they did receive credit for cooperating with the government’s investigation.

Medical Supply Company Charged for Alleged $30 Million Health Care Fraud

Federal prosecutors charged Mark Loftis, owner of Back Pain Home Supplies LLC doing business as EZ Medical Supply, with orchestrating a scheme to submit fraudulent claims to Medicare, TRICARE, and CHAMPVA for orthotic braces and other durable medical equipment (DME), and for theft of Provider Relief Funds (PRF) intended to support health care providers during the COVID-19 pandemic. According to the indictment, which was recently unsealed, Loftis paid illegal kickbacks to marketers in exchange for Medicare patient referrals and to marketers and telemedicine companies in exchange for signed doctors’ orders without meaningful patient evaluations. He then allegedly billed for medically unnecessary DME that was not provided as billed. Back Pain allegedly submitted approximately $30 million in false claims, of which the health care programs paid approximately $8 million.

Loftis is also accused of misusing over $133,000 in PRF money by falsely attesting to certain conditions and diverting funds to further the DME fraud scheme and for personal expenses. He is charged with conspiracy to commit health care fraud and wire fraud, conspiracy to defraud the United States and to offer, pay, solicit, and receive kickbacks, and two counts of theft of government property. If convicted, he faces up to 20 years in prison on the health care and wire fraud conspiracy count, five years on the conspiracy and kickback count, and 10 years on each theft of government property count.

An indictment is merely an allegation. All defendants are presumed innocent until proven guilty beyond a reasonable doubt in a court of law.

Kaiser Affiliates to Pay $556 Million for Alleged False Claims Act Violations

Affiliates of Kaiser Permanente (collectively, “Kaiser”), an integrated health care consortium, agreed to pay $556 million to resolve allegations that they violated the FCA by submitting invalid diagnosis codes for Medicare Advantage Plan enrollees in order to obtain higher payments from the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS). Under the Medicare Advantage (MA) Program, beneficiaries may opt out of traditional Medicare and enroll in private health plans offered by Medicare Advantage Organizations (MAOs). Kaiser owns and operates MAOs that offer MA plans to beneficiaries throughout the United States.

The government alleged that from 2009 to 2018, in California and Colorado, Kaiser systematically pressured physicians to add diagnoses to patient medical records that physicians had not addressed after patient visits were completed, which violated CMS rules. According to the allegations, Kaiser developed systems to mine patient histories for potential unsubmitted diagnoses and sent their providers queries urging them to add new diagnoses via addenda to patient medical records months or over a year after the related patient visits. The government also alleged that Kaiser set aggressive physician and facility targets tied to financial incentives. The government further alleged Kaiser knew the practices were unlawful and ignored red flags raised by its own physicians.

The civil settlement also resolves claims in related qui tam FCA cases brought by former Kaiser employees, Ronda Osinek and James M. Taylor, M.D. The relator share of the recovery will be $95 million.

The claims resolved by the settlement are allegations and there has been no determination of liability.

20 People Charged With Alleged Sports Bribery Scheme to Fix NCAA and CBA Basketball Games

On January 14, federal prosecutors in the Eastern District of Pennsylvania charged 20 college basketball players with a massive sports bribery scheme intended to influence Chinese Basketball Association (CBA) and National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) men’s basketball games. Prosecutors alleged violations of 18 U.S.C. § 224 (bribery in sporting contests), § 1349 (conspiracy to commit wire fraud), § 1343 (wire fraud), and § 2 (aiding and abetting). According to the indictment, from about September 2022 through February 2025, a group of individuals called “fixers” used bribes to induce CBA players to underperform in order to “point shave” so that their opponents would win and wagers placed on those winning teams would succeed. The scheme allegedly began with fixed CBA games and then expanded into NCAA games.

Prosecutors allege that the NCAA component ultimately involved more than 39 players across over 17 Division I men’s basketball teams and affected over 29 NCAA Division I men’s basketball games. The fixers allegedly made wagers totaling millions of dollars on the games and generated substantial proceeds for both the fixers and the other players involved in the games. According to the indictment, the fixers and players collectively received hundreds of thousands of dollars in bribe payments for fixing their teams’ games, with a typical payment between $10,000-$30,000 per game per player. For their scheme, the fixers allegedly targeted NCAA basketball players for whom the bribe payments would meaningfully supplement or exceed legitimate name, image, and likeness opportunities.

Historically, the Soldier Readiness Processing site on the installation has been operated by personnel from Madigan Army Medical Center (MAMC), while the Air Force has managed its deployment preparation independently. Leaders from both services are now collaborating to merge resources and establish a single, installation-wide capability rather than maintaining parallel systems.

“We operate as a joint medical force in theater; it is absolutely vital that we collaborate in preparing all personnel as they get ready to deploy,” said Col. Jimmy Watts, director, Madigan Army Medical Center. MAMC comprises a network of medical facilities located in Washington and California that serve more than 100,000 active-duty service members, their families and retirees, providing healthcare delivery under the Defense Health Agency.

As part of the integration effort, the combined Army and Air Force team is reviewing Air Force-specific deployment requirements and determining how best to incorporate them into the existing Soldier Readiness Processing site. Madigan and the 62nd Medical Squadron have already taken steps toward greater collaboration by integrating general dentists from Madigan into the McChord Clinic.

Officials stated that the decision to expand operations at the McChord Clinic was primarily driven by the facility’s robust infrastructure and well-established processes. Among the clinics on the installation, McChord’s facility most closely aligns with Joint Commission standards, making it well-suited to support a broader mission. Leaders also anticipate that the integration will lead to improvements in access to care.

Organizational changes were also made to support full integration. Before October, 2025, Air Force personnel at the McChord Clinic reported through Air Force leadership, while the clinic’s officer in charge reported to Madigan’s Department of Family Medicine. Leaders said that arrangement limited the unity of effort. The clinic is now unified under Col. John Hatfield, who has operational control of all assigned personnel and is responsible for the clinic’s operating budget.

Madigan Army Medical Center and the 62nd Medical Squadron are continuing to identify additional opportunities for collaboration, including the integration of pharmacy operations, to improve both efficiency and effectiveness of care across the installation.

What is TRICARE For Life? TFL is Medicare-wraparound coverage if you’re TRICARE-eligible and you’re eligible for Medicare Part A.You must have Medicare Part A and Part B to have TFL, regardless of your age or where you live.

Enrollment fees and premiums TFL has no enrollment fees or premiums. However, you need to pay Medicare premiums to have TFL. · Medicare Part A premiums are financed through payroll deductions while you’re working. · Medicare Part B has a monthly premium based on your income. This premium may change each year. If you receive monthly Social Security retirement or disability benefits, your Part B premium is deducted from these monthly benefits.

Learn more about paying Medicare premiums.

Costs for care covered by both Medicare and TRICARE Medicare and TRICARE work together to coordinate your benefits. Most health care services are covered by both Medicare and TRICARE.

The type of provider you see will affect your costs: · When you see a Medicare participating or Medicare non-participating provider, you have no out-of-pocket costs for services covered by both Medicare and TRICARE. Check out Health Plan Costs or the TRICARE For Life Cost Matrix to see examples of these costs for 2026. · Some providers opt out of Medicare. Medicare doesn’t pay for the services you get from these providers. If you see a provider who has opted out of Medicare, TRICARE pays the amount Medicare would have paid if Medicare had processed the claim. (This is normally up to 20% of the TRICARE-allowable charge.)

Learn more about types of Medicare providers. You can also learn about services Medicare covers and services TRICARE covers.

Costs for care only covered by Medicare When you get care that’s covered by Medicare only, Medicare processes the claim as the primary payer and pays the Medicare-allowed amount. TRICARE pays nothing. You’re responsible for theMedicare deductible and cost-shareand any remaining billed charges. See the TRICARE For Life Cost Matrix to learn more about 2026 Medicare deductibles.

Costs for care Medicare doesn’t cover Medicare doesn’t cover all health care services. Medicare also doesn’t cover care you get outside the U.S. and U.S. territories, as described in the TRICARE For Life Handbook.

In these cases: · TRICARE processes the claim as the primary payer and pays the TRICARE-allowable charge. You’re responsible for the applicable TRICARE deductible, cost-shares, and any remaining billed charges. · You’ll have lower out-of-pocket costs when you see a TRICARE network provider. Learn more about network providers in the U.S. and overseas providers.

During a calendar year (Jan. 1–Dec. 31), the most you pay for TRICARE-covered services and supplies is your TFL catastrophic cap. · The TFL catastrophic cap is $3,000. · When you meet your catastrophic cap, you don’t pay anything for the rest of the calendar year for services and supplies that are medically necessary and covered by TRICARE.

Costs for care not covered by Medicare or TRICARE When you get care that isn’t covered by Medicare or TRICARE, you’re responsible for the entire bill. This may be more than the Medicare-approved amount or TRICARE-allowable amount.

Pharmacy costs TFL includes prescription drug coverage through the TRICARE Pharmacy Program.

JOINT BASE LEWIS-MCCHORD, Wash.– Medical leaders at Joint Base Lewis-McChord are working to integrate military health care services across branches to improve efficiency and strengthen deployment readiness.

Historically, the Soldier Readiness Processing site on the installation has been operated by personnel from Madigan Army Medical Center (MAMC), while the Air Force has managed its deployment preparation independently. Leaders from both services are now collaborating to merge resources and establish a single, installation-wide capability rather than maintaining parallel systems.

“We operate as a joint medical force in theater; it is absolutely vital that we collaborate in preparing all personnel as they get ready to deploy,” said Col. Jimmy Watts, director, Madigan Army Medical Center. MAMC comprises a network of medical facilities located in Washington and California that serve more than 100,000 active-duty service members, their families and retirees, providing healthcare delivery under the Defense Health Agency.

As part of the integration effort, the combined Army and Air Force team is reviewing Air Force-specific deployment requirements and determining how best to incorporate them into the existing Soldier Readiness Processing site. Madigan and the 62nd Medical Squadron have already taken steps toward greater collaboration by integrating general dentists from Madigan into the McChord Clinic.

Officials stated that the decision to expand operations at the McChord Clinic was primarily driven by the facility’s robust infrastructure and well-established processes. Among the clinics on the installation, McChord’s facility most closely aligns with Joint Commission standards, making it well-suited to support a broader mission. Leaders also anticipate that the integration will lead to improvements in access to care.

Organizational changes were also made to support full integration. Before October, 2025, Air Force personnel at the McChord Clinic reported through Air Force leadership, while the clinic’s officer in charge reported to Madigan’s Department of Family Medicine. Leaders said that arrangement limited the unity of effort. The clinic is now unified under Col. John Hatfield, who has operational control of all assigned personnel and is responsible for the clinic’s operating budget.

Madigan Army Medical Center and the 62nd Medical Squadron are continuing to identify additional opportunities for collaboration, including the integration of pharmacy operations, to improve both efficiency and effectiveness of care across the installation.

Military working dogs The One Health approach also benefits the health and welfare of military working dogs.
By working across traditional boundaries, military health professionals can identify threats earlier, respond more effectively, and protect service members and their families more completely.","When a military working dog gets sick overseas, the issue can involve more than just animal health. When service members deploy to regions with different diseases, there are more than just human health hazards to consider. When food safety becomes a problem at a military dining facility, the cause could be germs originating from humans, animals, or the environment. These interconnected health challenges require an integrated solution, and that's where One Health comes in.

""I prefer to think of One Health as integrated public health, working collaboratively across multiple disciplines,"" said Dr. Kristina McElroy, Veterinary Defense Support of Civil Authorities and interagency coordinator, Veterinary Services Division, Defense Health Agency-Public Health in Falls Church, Virginia. “This transdisciplinary approach guides my daily work as a veterinarian in DHA-Public Health.”

This collaborative approach is protecting military communities worldwide by recognizing that human health, animal health, and environmental health are closely connected.

What is One Health?

One Health is a simple but powerful idea: The health of people, animals, and the environment are linked. When one area has a problem, it can affect the others. For military communities, One Health means taking a team approach to prevent diseases, ensure food safety, and protect service members and their families.

Deployment health protection

When service members deploy, they may face unique health challenges that civilian communities rarely encounter. Service members travel frequently, encounter or work with animals, and deploy to regions with different risks of infectious disease.

According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, zoonotic diseases are caused by germs that spread between animals and people, and are caused by harmful germs like viruses, bacterial parasites, and fungi.

""Different vectors may be present that increase risk of certain zoonotic diseases, so we consider different parasite prevention and sometimes different daily management practices to limit exposure,"" said Lt. Col. Crystal Doyle, chief of animal medicine, Veterinary Services Division, DHA-Public Health. ""We must also be familiar with differing requirements for reportable diseases in the various countries in which we work.""

This global perspective is also essential for protecting military families. When service members deploy to different regions, they may encounter diseases that aren’t prevalent in their home stations. One Health approaches help identify these risks early and develop prevention strategies.

The benefits of One Health aren't theoretical; they're saving lives and protecting military operations every day, said McElroy.

""During outbreaks of highly pathogenic avian influenza, chikungunya, Zika, as well as COVID-19 — which are all zoonotic diseases — the collaborative interdisciplinary approach of One Health has protected service members' health,"" said McElroy. ""Veterinary Services has worked hand in hand with colleagues at the Armed Forces Health Surveillance Division, the military services and U.S. government agencies to ensure guidance and recommendations are coordinated and appropriate for the military population.""

The One Health approach also benefits the health and welfare of military working dogs. MWDs are valuable team members who can be affected by zoonotic diseases that can also affect service members.

""There have been MWD kennels with multiple dogs affected by similar clinical signs and symptoms that pointed to a possible zoonotic disease,"" said Doyle. ""While testing was pending to determine a definitive diagnosis, operational tempo was decreased to limit human exposure to the suspected zoonotic disease.""

Military veterinarians also submit ticks from their patients for disease screening, or disease confirmation if a patient is suspected of being infected, said Doyle.

“We routinely submit blood samples from our MWD population to screen for tick-borne diseases, many of which are also found in the human population (such as Lyme disease).”

Food Safety Protection

Food safety is a key part of the One Health mission, as military dining facilities serve thousands of meals daily.

""The military uses a multidisciplinary, multiservice, and interagency approach to analyze food safety and security from a One Health perspective,"" said Lt. Col. Melissa Hehr, deputy chief, Veterinary Services Division, DHA-Public Health. ""This requires close coordination amongst agencies and military services with responsibilities for food procurement, food protection, food sanitation, preventive medicine, public health, diagnostic laboratory, policy, and regulatory functions.""

Global health security benefits

One Health approaches don't just protect individual service members; they strengthen global health security for everyone.

""One Health initiatives leverage unique military capabilities to contribute to the United States' global health security efforts,"" said McElroy. ""Specifically for veterinary services, the DOW (Department of War) provides training to veterinarians and public health professionals in partner nations, strengthening their capacity to prevent and respond to disease outbreaks.""

The military also helps strengthen public health infrastructure worldwide, including laboratories, surveillance systems, and disease reporting networks that benefit both military and civilian populations, said McElroy.

Monitoring emerging threats

Military veterinarians, physicians, environmental health specialists, and public health experts work together using One Health principles. This teamwork helps identify health threats early and respond more effectively than any single group could. An example of this type of collaboration can be found in how these teams are managing the threat of New World screwworm.

“There is currently ongoing collaboration between military veterinary, medical, biosurveillance, and pest management teams to monitor and prepare for a potential incursion of New World screwworm into the United States,” said Hehr. “This flesh-eating parasite is actually a perfect example of a One Health problem where an integrative approach is being used to analyze, monitor, and mitigate the threat posed to human, animal, and environmental health, as well as military operations, food and agriculture, and national security.”

Overcoming challenges

Implementing One Health approaches in military settings requires overcoming unique challenges.

""I think the greatest challenge to implementing a One Health approach lies in our ability to develop a mutual understanding of the capabilities, responsibilities, and authorities of the various organizations and entities that are required for effective One Health integration under different contexts,"" said Hehr.

Military health teams work to build these relationships through various communication methods, including news articles, information papers, social media posts, email, meetings, webinars, and educational courses, said Hehr.

Working together for health

The success of One Health depends on collaboration across different specialties and organizations.

""At DHA Veterinary Services, we strive for collaborative communication and integration across the joint force and entire DOW,"" McElroy explains.

This teamwork includes partnerships among military veterinarians, human health professionals, environmental specialists, and public health experts from all service branches. The approach is proactive rather than reactive.

By working across traditional boundaries, military health professionals can identify threats earlier, respond more effectively, and protect service members and their families more completely. As health threats become more complex and global, One Health approaches become more important for protecting military communities.

The Defense Health Agency supports our Nation by improving health and building readiness—making extraordinary experiences ordinary and exceptional outcomes routine.

TRICARE serves active-duty service members, retirees, and their families with comprehensive medical, dental, pharmacy, and specialty benefits. But eligibility isn’t one-size-fits-all; it varies based on military status and family relationships.

Active duty service members are automatically enrolled in TRICARE Prime—a plan that offers care at military hospitals or through network providers. For those stationed overseas or looking for more flexibility in provider choice, there’s also TRICARE Select Overseas.

Family members play an important role too. Spouses and children under 21 (or up to 23 if they’re enrolled in college) qualify for various plans depending on their sponsor's status. Retired service members have access to additional options like TRICARE For Life if they are also enrolled in Medicare.

But what happens during transitions? Many individuals don’t realize that simply retiring from active duty doesn’t mean your coverage continues seamlessly. It’s vital to verify registration with DEERS (Defense Enrollment Eligibility Reporting System) before making any changes or enrolling anew—this step ensures everyone listed has current information.

Blaine McGraw.

The policy, rolled out in December 2025 and announced publicly this month, marks a direct response to the McGraw case, in which the Army doctor faces 54 counts of indecent visual recording involving 44 women at Carl R. Darnall Army Medical Center and Tripler Army Medical Center in Hawaii.

What Changed

Under the new policy, staff at all military treatment facilities worldwide must now proactively offer chaperones for any sensitive examination. Previously, facilities were only required to accommodate patient requests for chaperones — placing the burden on patients to ask for protection.

""Having chaperones available is a crucial part of patient-centered care,"" said Dr. Paul Cordts, DHA Deputy Assistant Director for Medical Affairs and Chief Medical Officer. ""Chaperones can help protect both patients and health care staff.""

The policy defines chaperones as ""an impartial third party and a safeguard for patients and staff"" who will ""immediately report any suspected inappropriate conduct.""

Lawsuit Alleges Systematic Failures

But according to a civil lawsuit filed in Bell County on Dec. 10th, 2025, by 82 women, the damage from the old policy was already done.

The petition alleges McGraw ""routinely altered and falsified records...recording the presence of chaperones who, in fact, were never in the room.""

The petition argues that ""the Army's chaperone policy at Darnall Army Medical Center...placed the burden of protection on the very women least equipped to insist on safeguards"" — particularly military spouses, dependents, and junior soldiers who felt intimidated by a male field-grade officer.

Many women requested chaperones but were denied by McGraw, according to the petition.

Shield of Sisters and the Cobos Law Firm brought four survivors to Capitol Hill, pushing Congress to go further than the DHA policy by making chaperones mandatory — not optional.

""We think that chaperones should be mandatory. It should not be optional, nor should it be up to the discretion of the individual who is receiving care,"" said attorney Andrew Cobos, who represents the 82 women suing McGraw.

Cobos argued that mandatory chaperones would not only protect patients but also save taxpayer money by preventing costly federal lawsuits.

""We have seen multiple instances — the Michael Stockton case, this case, the Nassar case — where the federal government has been sued for legitimate reasons for their failure to provide oversight, and that has cost taxpayers hundreds of millions of dollars,"" Cobos said.

Three Legislative Proposals

The advocates introduced three pieces of legislation during their meetings with House representatives, senators, and the Democratic Women's Caucus:

Mandatory chaperones during sensitive medical examinations

Expanded definition of military sexual trauma (MST) to include family members and Department of Defense civilians

Commander accountability for ""quiet PCSing"" — the practice of transferring problem service members without resolving issues internally

""They were saying, 'We thought we'd fixed this with Vanessa Guillen and we thought we did this right,'"" said Shannon Hough, founder and CEO of Shield of Sisters. ""And we told them there's nothing you can do until we start holding commanders and perpetrators accountable just like we would on the civilian side.""

The Transfer That Wasn't Stopped

The lawsuit alleges that McGraw transferred from Tripler to Fort Hood after a patient complained he improperly recorded her pelvic exam on his personal cell phone.

""Rather than investigate or meaningfully restrict his practice, McGraw's chain of command dismissed the complaint, minimized her allegations, and permitted him to continue treating women with little or no supervision,"" the petition states.

The lawsuit calls this a ""systemic military and leadership failure — not an isolated incident.""

Bipartisan Support

Hough said the response from lawmakers was overwhelmingly positive and bipartisan.

""It's so encouraging that they're saying this is not a partisan issue, this is a human issue,"" Hough said.

Lawmakers were shocked to learn the scope of military sexual trauma, Hough said.

""You would not believe how many of them don't know that it's one in three women, that it is such a huge issue. It's a systemic problem and it's an endemic problem,"" Hough said. ""The public needs to know how bad this problem is.""

According to the advocates, more than 56,000 survivors are currently waiting for compensation exams from the Department of Veterans Affairs.

What the New Policy Means for Patients

Under the new DHA policy:

Staff must offer chaperones before any sensitive exam (examinations involving genitalia, rectum, or female breasts)

Patients can request chaperones when scheduling appointments or during visits

Staff will make ""reasonable efforts"" to provide a chaperone of the preferred gender

If a chaperone isn't available, patients can reschedule

Chaperones can be physicians, nurses, medics, technicians, or other qualified staff

The policy applies to all military hospitals and clinics worldwide

Patients with questions or concerns should contact their facility's patient advocate.

The policy may be waived in emergency situations.

Where the Case Stands

McGraw, 47, remains in pretrial confinement at the Bell County Jail. He faces four charges and 61 specifications, with alleged offenses occurring between January 1 and December 1, 2025.

Cobos said his firm has filed a motion for default judgment against McGraw after he failed to respond to the civil lawsuit. They've also submitted Federal Tort Claims Act cases seeking compensation from the federal government, but must wait six months for the Army to respond.

'We're Not Done'

Hough emphasized that the fight extends far beyond the McGraw case.

""We're not done in DC. There's gonna be many more trips. We're not done in Fort Hood or Tripler,"" Hough said. ""We're not done until the last person says, 'I'm the last one who was assaulted in the military,' and that's gonna take a lot.""",https://media.kcentv.com/assets/KCEN/images/79db87a3-6f03-4367-adfa-c1e3fa4c92c0/20251211T123515/79db87a3-6f03-4367-adfa-c1e3fa4c92c0_1140x641.jpg,N,-1.0,2026-01-20 00:56:30.259624

At United Benefits, we specialize in helping federal employees and retirees make sense of their benefit options and guide them toward the best choices for both the present and future. Let’s break down how TRICARE and FEHB work together and what you need to know for a smooth transition into retirement.

Understanding TRICARE

TRICARE is the Department of Defense’s health insurance program for active-duty service members, retirees, and their families. After military retirement, most are eligible for TRICARE Prime or TRICARE Select, and upon turning 65, they transition to TRICARE For Life (TFL) when enrolled in Medicare Part A and Part B. TRICARE’s coverage is comprehensive, but understanding how it integrates with other federal health insurance options, such as FEHB, is crucial to avoiding overlap and unnecessary expenses.

Understanding FEHB

The Federal Employees Health Benefits (FEHB) Program offers federal employees and annuitants access to a wide range of private health plans. Coverage continues into retirement as long as you’ve been enrolled for the five years preceding your retirement—or since first becoming eligible. FEHB plans include HMOs, PPOs, and high-deductible options, giving retirees flexibility in terms of providers and premiums. Importantly, you can carry FEHB into retirement even if you’re also eligible for TRICARE.

Coordinating TRICARE and FEHB Coverage

While both programs offer outstanding coverage, maintaining both can sometimes lead to duplication of benefits. Understanding how these two programs coordinate is critical for making informed decisions:

Primary vs. Secondary Coverage: When you have both TRICARE and FEHB, the FEHB plan usually pays first, and TRICARE pays second, covering some or all of your remaining out-of-pocket expenses.

Optional Coverage Strategy: Some retirees choose to suspend (not cancel) their FEHB coverage once they’re covered by TRICARE For Life. This suspension allows them to avoid paying monthly FEHB premiums while retaining the right to reenroll in FEHB later if their circumstances change.

Retain FEHB for Flexibility: Maintaining FEHB coverage can be beneficial for those who live near medical providers who do not accept TRICARE or for anyone who wants additional provider network options.

TRICARE For Life (TFL) and Medicare Coordination

Once you reach age 65 and become eligible for Medicare, you transition from TRICARE Select or Prime into TRICARE For Life (TFL). In this setup, Medicare acts as your primary payer, and TFL pays most of what Medicare doesn’t cover. This can make carrying FEHB in addition to TFL seem redundant. However, maintaining or suspending FEHB coverage should be considered carefully.

According to the Defense Health Agency, more than 5.6 million individuals were enrolled in TRICARE as of 2023, showing how critical it remains for military families across the country (Defense Health Agency, 2023). With more retirees transitioning into federal service and later into Medicare, understanding this coordination is more important than ever.

FEHB Suspension Option for Retirees with TRICARE

Federal retirees with TRICARE For Life can suspend their FEHB plan rather than cancel it outright. This option is available because TRICARE is recognized as an eligible alternative coverage under the Office of Personnel Management (OPM) guidelines. By suspending FEHB, retirees avoid paying monthly FEHB premiums but keep the right to reinstate FEHB in the future—such as if they lose TRICARE eligibility or decide they need additional coverage options.

This suspension option is particularly attractive because reinstatement can occur during any open season or after a qualifying life event, without penalty. Retirees who choose to keep both may do so for reasons such as extra coverage for prescription drugs, access to specific doctors, or family coverage considerations.

Cost Considerations

Balancing TRICARE and FEHB coverage involves understanding premiums, copays, and deductibles. FEHB plans have monthly premiums that can range substantially depending on the plan selected. TRICARE, meanwhile, has lower premiums but requires enrollment fees for certain plans. When evaluating both, consider your health needs, dependents, and future healthcare locations—especially if you plan to relocate after retirement.

As of 2024, TRICARE Select family coverage had an annual enrollment fee of $537.60 for retirees, while TRICARE Prime family coverage had an annual enrollment fee of $744 (TRICARE.mil). FEHB premiums, on the other hand, vary widely but can easily exceed $5,000 a year for comprehensive family plans. These costs highlight the financial advantage that suspension of FEHB may provide for some retirees, though decisions should be based on total expected out-of-pocket costs and provider access.

Making an Informed Decision

No two retirees have the same needs, so there is no one-size-fits-all solution for coordinating TRICARE and FEHB. The right combination depends on your family situation, medical requirements, anticipated travel or relocation, and preferred healthcare providers. Before making changes, it’s wise to consult with a benefits specialist who understands both federal and military systems.

At United Benefits, we provide personalized federal benefits counseling to help you evaluate your options and ensure you’re making informed, strategic decisions. Our experts help federal employees, military retirees, and their families navigate enrollment periods, coverage questions, and planning for future transitions like Medicare eligibility.

Tips for Managing TRICARE and FEHB Together

Review your FEHB plan during Open Season each year, even if you currently have TRICARE, to ensure you’re not missing potential savings or improved coverage options.

Understand your family’s healthcare patterns—if you have dependents not eligible for TRICARE, maintaining FEHB may be essential.

When you reach Medicare eligibility age, review how Medicare, TRICARE For Life, and FEHB interact before making final decisions.

Speak with a United Benefits specialist to ensure your decisions align with both your immediate and long-term healthcare needs.
