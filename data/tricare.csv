No one takes better care of your career than you.” Source Minnesota National Guard (ngmnpublic.zurewebsesus).","At 43 years old, with a wife and three kids, Minnesota Army National Guard Chief Warrant Officer 2 (CW2) Patrick Kooiker returned to the Minnesota National Guard in 2021 after nearly a decade away from the military.

“The first time I joined the military I did it because all my friends were doing it,” said Kooiker, a network operation warrant officer. “This time, I joined for the benefits, especially TRICARE for Life and the Post 9/11 GI Bill, but mostly TRICARE for my kids.”

Kooiker, a Bayport resident, first served from 1995 to 2010. He spent two years with the army reserves and 13 years with the Minnesota Air National Guard’s Saint Paulbased 133rd Airlift Wing. He also served a one-year active-duty rotation with the National Guard Bureau.

“I was a key player in the restructuring of the mission for the Fargo, ND, unit to transition from an F-16 unit to a drone unit,” said Kooiker. “I also played a role in moving the B2 aircraft to Andersen Air Force Base.”

After reaching the rank of master sergeant, Kooiker transferred to the Individual Ready Reserve. There, he conducted contracting operations in Afghanistan and Kyrgyzstan before leaving the military in 2015.

A pivotal moment came when mentors Minnesota Army National Guard Colonel Carl Fassbender and Minnesota National Guard Command Chief Warrant Officer 5 Erik Homme recognized the value of Kooiker’s expertise and encouraged him to return to service. But, one obstacle held him back from serving. He did not meet the current height and weight requirements.

“I was 90 pounds overweight, Kooiker said. “I started walking, dieting, daily workouts, and I ran my life as though food was fuel.” Nothing was going to keep him from achieving his goal to serve again. Once he lost the extra weight, he was one step closer to rejoining.

By 2021, Kooiker saw that dream come true as he enlisted for the second time, this time as a soldier in the Minnesota Army National Guard.

“Patrick was appointed as a warrant officer in 2022 and quickly demonstrated a maturity and depth of knowledge comparable to our senior signal warrant officers,” Homme said. “He had over 15 years of army reserve and air national guard service prior, and he honed his IT/cyber skills at 3M and Securian during his break in service T ese experiences, coupled with his maturity and desire to mentor others were a perfect fit for the warrant officer corps and the Minnesota National Guard. His passion for the corps and deep IT/cyber kn wedge are ke t ur success n th a .” Not long after enlisting, Kooiker left for a second round of basic training. There, drill sergeants recognized his leadership and knowledge and allowed him to coach and mentor newer service members. “The drill sergeants trusted me to get things done at the barracks,” Kooiker said. “They would bring us back from dinner chow, and I would take charge of the formation and ensure they were in bed by eight and up by four.”

After graduating basic training, Kooiker attended the warrant officer basic course and became qualified as a network operations warrant officer, adding to the guard’s growing cyber capabilities and network oversight. Hs role as a warrant officer merges with his civilian career where he works in information technology and electronics engineering.

“I get to do things most will never experience,” said Kooiker. “Running cybersecurity exercises and simulating enemy attacks allows us to refine ou equipment, improve ou act cs and p epare s vi e member o defend our systems in rea world scen ios ”

Kooiker is working to bridge the gap between civilian expertise and military application. His ability to leverage knowledge gained in both sectors allows him to find areas for improvement and share best practices.

“CW2 Kooiker is a role model and champion for any noncommissioned officer considering becoming a warrant officer,” said Homme. “He fully supports our warrant officer candidate program through instruction, mentorship, and event participation. He readily helps others understand the networking that is used and goes out of his way to volunteer to teach classes and attend seminars that benefit other cyber teams at symposiums.”

His commitment to serve extends beyond the drill hall. Kooiker recently coordinated food and supplies for service members assigned to the guard’s cyber protection team who were responding to cyberattacks in St. Paul. He also dedicates time to the Minnesota National Guard Youth Camp, Memorial Day events, the Civil Air Patrol, and, with his wife, coaches their daughter’s special needs baseball team.

Driven by a desire to make a positive impact, Kooiker lives by the army values. He links the past and the future of the Minnesota National Guard, representing the next generation of cyber warriors. Though not new to military service, Kooiker is a rising leader, shaping others within the cyber community.

“Do as much as you can, as you never have enough time or money,” Kooiker said. “Start doing what you love now. No one takes better care of your career than you.”

Kimberly Spahn, department head, Orthopedics, Naval Medical Center San Diego.
“It’s great for service members whose training involves water activities,” said Jill Eastin, business manager, Department of Orthopedics Surgery, Naval Medical Center San Diego.
NMCSD employs more than 5,000 active duty military personnel, civilians, and contractors in Southern California to deliver exceptional care afloat and ashore.","Naval Medical Center San Diego (NMCSD) has become one of the first Military Treatment Facilities (MTF) to adopt a cutting-edge new 3D-printing technology for producing waterproof casts. The technology, developed by ActivArmor, uses additive manufacturing to create breathable casts and splints that allow for improved treatment options with fewer limitations on patients’ activities.

The waterproof casts offer several advantages over traditional fiberglass casts or plaster splints, according to U.S. Navy Cmdr. Kimberly Spahn, department head, Orthopedics, Naval Medical Center San Diego.

“You can swim in these and play sports, so they’re great for kids. They’re more hygienic. You can take them on and off so we avoid a lot of the skin breakdown we see with fiberglass and plaster casts,” Spahn said.

Spahn noted that the new casts are not appropriate for all orthopedic conditions, and traditional fiberglass or plaster casts remain an effective treatment in many cases, but if deemed appropriate by a medical provider, the waterproof casts can be especially useful for military service members, who can return to duty or training throughout the recovery process.

“It’s great for service members whose training involves water activities,” said Jill Eastin, business manager, Department of Orthopedics Surgery, Naval Medical Center San Diego. “They are able to still go out in the water and continue training in a way that isn’t possible with traditional casts.”

Each cast is custom-fit, allowing providers to make patient-specific modifications, such as amputated fingers or toes, metal pins or other surgical implants, and children with small limbs that don’t fit standard casts or splints, according to U.S. Navy Hospital Corpsman Petty Officer Third Class Danny Berroa Figueroa.

“It’s actually a really simple process. We just use the forward facing camera on a mobile device, and we will mark on the skin around bony areas or anything we don’t want to rub, and just scan someone’s arm or leg like that,” said Berroa Figueroa. “Once it’s good, we send it off to an engineer who analyzes it and figures out the best way to create the cast, they send back the guide file and we feed it into the machine to start printing.”

NMCSD is the second MTF to implement the technology, along with Walter Reed National Military Medical Center in Bethesda, Maryland, after ActivArmor received a $1.3 million competitive SBIR direct-to-phase II grant award from the Defense Health Agency. The award “will facilitate the deployment of ActivArmor systems to 11 military bases over 24 months,” according to the company’s website.

For flight physicals alone, the number of required clinic visits has been slashed from four to five to just two.
The implementation of the digital systems for the CAB clinic has improved service delivery and minimized lost paperwork, resulting in enhanced communication.
Looking ahead, Wilkerson’s vision extends beyond the CAB Clinic.","Wheeler Army Airfield, Hawaii – The 25th Combat Aviation Brigade (CAB) clinic, part of Desmond T. Doss Health Clinic (DDHC), is improving medical care for Soldiers through a digital transformation led by Staff Sgt. Crystal Wilkerson, the clinic’s noncommissioned officer in charge (NCOIC). The initiative has reduced wait times, eased administrative tasks and expanded access to medical services.

Wilkerson’s exceptional work deserved official recognition, thought Nora Aui, a registered nurse at DDHC. “I’d like to nominate, NCOIC of CAB, Staff Sgt. Wilkerson, on her innovative clinic initiatives,” wrote Aui. “She has taken the initiative to learn about, utilize the latest technology that the military offers us, and apply it to our clinic processes for packet submissions to increase availability to our service members.”

Starting in the summer of 2023, Wilkerson took the initiative to self-teach digital form creation and QR code generation, utilizing online resources to build a system that has dramatically altered clinic operations. The core of the transformation lies in the transition from paper-based requests to digital forms, accessible via QR codes and email. These codes are distributed to all units, including National Guard elements and those in remote locations, ensuring accessibility for all Soldiers.

“Too many Soldiers were making multiple trips to the clinic simply to request and submit paperwork,” Wilkerson said. “I saw an opportunity to leverage technology to alleviate that burden and free up both their time and our staff’s.”

The impact has been substantial. For flight physicals alone, the number of required clinic visits has been slashed from four to five to just two. Soldiers can now download, complete and submit packets remotely, a game-changer for those with demanding training schedules or geographic limitations. This same digital process has been successfully implemented for flight school, Officer Candidate School (OCS), warrant officer, and Standardized Electronic Enrollment Reporting (SEER) physicals, each presenting unique requirements and previously cumbersome procedures.

“We’ve seen at least a 50% reduction in required clinic visits for packet processes,” Wilkerson said. “Processing time for flight physicals has dropped from three weeks to as little as one week, depending on the patient's responsiveness.”

Beyond time savings, the digitization effort has yielded a host of benefits. Shorter check-in lines, reduced congestion at the front desk and a wider reach to Soldiers across diverse locations are all contributing to a more positive experience. The implementation of the digital systems for the CAB clinic has improved service delivery and minimized lost paperwork, resulting in enhanced communication.

The transition wasn't without its challenges. Wilkerson faced a learning curve in mastering the new technologies and navigating the complexities of designing branching logic within the digital forms to tailor questions based on individual needs. Successfully managing change within the clinic required a gradual implementation process and a willingness to incorporate feedback from staff and providers.

Looking ahead, Wilkerson’s vision extends beyond the CAB Clinic. She plans to expand these digital processes to all clinics under her purview, with a particular focus on school physicals and other routine paperwork. She also aims to proactively push forms directly to units, further accelerating processing times and improving Soldier readiness. Collaboration with web management is underway to ensure clinic websites accurately reflect current procedures, eliminating outdated information and guiding Soldiers to the most efficient pathways for care.

“These changes benefit our service members, the medical support assistants, the flight physical nurse and our medics,” Aui added in her nomination of Staff Sgt. Wilkerson. “She deserves recognition for all her hard work and the improvements made to CAB.”

Once orders are received, EFMP families should be allowed assignment to a new PCM at the receiving duty station.
This could allow EFMP families to get a head start without having to deal with the significant delays associated with awaiting PCM assignment when moving.
This would let providers at the current duty station connect families with counterparts at the new one seamlessly.
This solution augments the first two and could allow for PCM meetings with EFMP families via available telehealth options.","Moving to a new duty station is a hallmark of military life, but for families enrolled in the Department of Defense's Exceptional Family Member Program (also known as “EFMP”), which supports service members with dependents who have medical, educational, or developmental needs, the process can feel overwhelmingly complicated. As someone who has navigated these challenges firsthand, I know it's often far harder than it needs to be. Simple changes by the War Department and policy makers could make a big difference in easing the burden, improving the quality of life, and boosting retention rates among service members.

Timing is Everything

The core problem stems from timing. Many essential services for children or spouses with special needs can't begin until the family has a physical address at the new location. This includes therapies like Applied Behavior Analysis for autism, occupational therapy to build daily living skills, or speech therapy for communication challenges. These aren't quick fixes; they often involve long waitlists and evaluations that can stretch for months.

Education adds another layer of difficulty. Enrolling a child in a school that can accommodate an Individualized Education Program (also known as an “IEP”), a customized plan for students with disabilities, requires knowing if the local district has the right resources. Without advance information, families might end up in a neighborhood where the nearest suitable school is an hour away, as happened during my most recent move. I had been homeschooling my child for two years due to the pandemic, but waiting six months for an appropriate placement was still disruptive. While school systems fall outside the Defense Department's direct control, the ripple effects limit housing choices and force tough decisions, like becoming a ""geo-bachelor"" (living apart from family) or accepting suboptimal assignments to stay near support networks.

How to Fix it

These hurdles aren't just inconvenient; they strain relationships, finances, and careers. Service members may hesitate to take promotions or overseas tours if it means uprooting critical care. Fortunately, practical solutions exist that the military could implement to smooth transitions.

First, the military's health care system, TRICARE, should allow referrals for specialized services to be initiated before the move. Once orders are in hand, families could secure approvals remotely, reducing downtime upon arrival. The status quo means that nothing with the process can even start until the family has physically moved to the new duty station. This creates significant delays in beginning services.

Second, assigning a primary care manager (also referred to as a “PCM”), a key point of contact for medical needs, should happen prior to reporting to the new base. This would enable continuity of care without starting from scratch. As with the first item, this is currently a major constraint that delays services being initiated upon moving. Once orders are received, EFMP families should be allowed assignment to a new PCM at the receiving duty station. This could allow EFMP families to get a head start without having to deal with the significant delays associated with awaiting PCM assignment when moving.

Third, for ongoing treatments, initial referrals could shift to telehealth options, building on virtual care advancements made in recent years. This would let providers at the current duty station connect families with counterparts at the new one seamlessly. This solution augments the first two and could allow for PCM meetings with EFMP families via available telehealth options. Utilizing this functionality would help to potentially cut months of waiting time for services.

Finally, the EFMP could maintain up-to-date lists of therapy providers that accept TRICARE and have openings for new patients. Currently, families often discover dead ends after arrival, wasting precious time. Resources like the EFMP website could host these directories, perhaps integrated with tools from Military OneSource.

Implementing these changes wouldn't require overhauling the entire system. Some, like telehealth expansions, align with existing policies and could be piloted quickly. The payoff? Happier, healthier families who feel supported, leading to higher reenlistment rates and a stronger force overall. As the military competes for talent in a tight job market, prioritizing these improvements isn't just compassionate - it's strategic.

The deadline is Sept. 30 and applies to two types of referrals. This includes beneficiaries who have been receiving care under referrals issued during the special referral approval waiver period earlier this year. Those who used the waiver between Jan. 1 and June 30 and still need to continue seeing that specialist after Sept. 30 must obtain a new referral to a network specialist before Oct. 1, according to Tricare officials.

The second type of referral includes active referrals issued before Jan. 1 by the previous Tricare West Region contractor, Health Net Federal Services. These beneficiaries can continue to see the specialist listed on the referral through its expiration date or Sept. 30, whichever comes first.

Tricare Prime beneficiaries who require specialty care after Sept. 30 must contact their primary care manager to receive the new referral for their specialist. Starting Oct. 1, point-of-service fees may apply to those who see a specialist who isn’t in the Tricare network.

TriWest Healthcare Alliance, the West Region contractor, requires processing time to approve a new referral, so Defense Health Agency officials are encouraging beneficiaries to take action now.

The referral approval waivers were implemented earlier this year to help ease the problems families had been experiencing since TriWest took over the West Region contract at the start of the year. One issue was that Tricare Prime families hadn’t been able to get referrals approved by TriWest, which is traditionally required before Tricare Prime beneficiaries can receive specialty care.

“If you live in the West Region, it’s important that you take the time now to evaluate your current referrals,” said Jacob Sanchez, referral management subject expert for Tricare, in the Tricare announcement about the deadline. “Work with your primary care manager and plan ahead for specialty care you may need starting Oct. 1.”

That’s why the TRICARE Dental Program covers two routine dental cleanings and examinations each year.

“Regular dental care isn’t just about having a nice smile, it’s about protecting your overall health, so you can avoid bigger issues down the road,” said Douglas Elsesser, a program analyst with the Dental Program Branch of the TRICARE Health Plan at the Defense Health Agency.

Prevention is the best medicine

Preventive dental care is important, even if you’re brushing and flossing every day just like you’re supposed to. Your mouth is constantly dealing with bacteria, sugars, and acids from eating and drinking throughout the day. Despite your best efforts, plaque and tartar can build up in hard-to-reach spaces on your teeth and gums.

Plaque is a sticky film that constantly forms on teeth. If not removed, it hardens into tartar, which can cause:

Cavities. The acids in plaque erode your tooth enamel (the outer covering of your tooth).

Gum disease (gingivitis & periodontitis).

Plaque irritates your gums, leading to inflammation. Untreated gingivitis can lead to periodontitis, which is an infection of the gums that may damage the soft tissue and the bones supporting your teeth.

When you go to the dentist, a professional cleaning will remove plaque and tartar and they’ll also be able to identify early signs of trouble ranging from gingivitis to oral cancer.

Gum disease and overall health

According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, gum disease doesn’t just affect the state of your oral health, but also the overall health of your body. For example, gingivitis or periodontitis can make blood sugar harder to control for people who have diabetes. Some studies show there may also be a link between poor oral health and having a number of chronic health conditions.

Get even more from your TDP dental plan! If you’re pregnant or have a qualifying chronic condition, you could get extra benefits. Visit the TDP website to find out about the TDP Wellness Program and how it can give you more dental care at no added cost.

Getting the most out of the TDP

Between brushing twice a day for two minutes and flossing once a day, your oral health care routine may take only five minutes out of your whole day. When you put that into perspective, it’s amazing how only five minutes out of your day, can not only keep your body healthy, but it can also save you thousands of dollars.

By taking advantage of your TDP benefit, you can:

Prevent health problems. Regular cleanings prevent cavities and gum disease, keeping your mouth and body healthy, and it also allows your dentist the opportunity to notice other health concerns.

Save time and money. Addressing dental issues early on is always less expensive and time-consuming than dealing with advanced problems requiring extensive treatment. Preventive care can stop things before they start.

Maintain a bright smile. Professional cleanings not only remove plaque and tartar but also polish your teeth, leaving you with a brighter, healthier-looking smile.",https://www.militaryspot.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/tricare-dental.png,N,1.0,2025-09-17 17:59:47.234667

Customer-driven investigations The ergonomics team determines focus areas through both systematic processes and direct customer requests.
In some cases, an ergonomics team member will virtually attend regularly scheduled SOH meetings, said Lauren Costanzi, DHA-PH ergonomist.","Musculoskeletal injuries represent a significant challenge for military readiness, accounting for roughly 95% of all military injuries and serving as the leading cause of medical visits, limited duty, and medical discharges across the armed forces.

To combat this pervasive threat to force readiness, the Defense Health Agency-Public Health ergonomics program within the Occupational Health Sciences directorate at Aberdeen Proving Ground, Maryland, takes a comprehensive approach that recognizes optimal human performance as critical to mission success.

""The program recognizes that ergonomic design is both a force protection and force-multiplication strategy,"" said Steven Chervak, a DHA-PH ergonomist. ""We aim to enhance warfighter performance, health, and safety by integrating ergonomic and human factors principles into military systems, equipment, and operations to reduce injury risk and optimize human-system performance.""

The primary goals of the ergonomics and human factors field are to reduce human error, increase productivity and efficiency, enhance safety, and reduce exposure to work-related musculoskeletal disorder risk factors, said John Pentikis, DHA-PH Ergonomics Branch manager.

Three-pronged approach to injury prevention

The DHA-PH ergonomics team accomplishes its mission through three primary focus areas: design reviews, worksite assessments, and training and education initiatives.

Design reviews, frequently conducted through the health hazard assessment process, aim to incorporate ergonomic principles into the acquisition process to ensure purchased or developed equipment is designed for optimal human performance prior to fielding.

“This proactive approach allows the team to identify and address potential injury risks before equipment reaches service members,” said Chervak.

Worksite assessments use job hazard analysis and biomechanical assessment techniques to optimize performance by improving human-machine interaction. These assessments focus on reducing ergonomic risk factors such as excessive force generation, repetitive motions, and exposure to vibration while optimizing posture for various military tasks, said Chervak.

“We assess a wide variety of work environments, including military hospitals and clinics, clinical care and laboratory settings, laundry and dining services, and industrial environments from cable assembly to paint booths and vehicle maintenance,” said Pentikis. “We also assess musculoskeletal-specific tasks such as weapons loading, litter carrying, parachute rigging, and load carriage.”

The training and education component involves multiple audiences, from teaching occupational health and safety personnel to perform worksite assessments to instructing service members on proper lifting and material handling techniques, said Chervak. The program also provides equipment-specific and site-specific training while educating leadership on ergonomic principles.

“For example, the ergonomics program recently developed specific ergonomic trainings in the areas of dining services, vehicle mechanics, emergency medical technicians, laboratories, and health care environments at the request of customers,” said Chervak.

The ergonomics team continually assesses ergonomics concerns as new equipment is developed.

“There are always new patient care environments, equipment, and circumstances to be assessed for safe patient handling and mobility, and the majority of work environments across the military place workers and military members at some level of musculoskeletal disorder risk,” said Kelsey McCoskey, a DHA-PH ergonomist. “Each time a depot mission changes, and a new system or equipment is being built or refurbished, the ergonomic risk factors change. Helping the local safety and occupational health personnel to continuously identify, prioritize, and remediate these work-related musculoskeletal risks is part of our mission.”

Real-world impact on military operations

Recent ergonomics evaluations have highlighted the direct impact our program can have on service members’ lethality, readiness, and equipment development, said Chervak.

""Studies have established a link between exposure to high levels of whole-body vibration and slowed reaction times,” said Chervak. “In combat scenarios, this delay can be the difference between life and death, especially when rapidly exiting a vehicle and returning fire. However, until now, the levels of whole-body vibration experienced by service members operating in military vehicles during realistic training and operational environments remained largely unknown.”

To address this critical knowledge gap, Chervak and McCoskey collaborated with the National Guard Bureau’s Office of the Joint Surgeon to pilot whole-body vibration exposure data collection on opposing force military vehicles during a recent Operation Northern Strike training exercise. This effort provides crucial data towards characterizing the whole-body vibration exposure soldiers face on missions, said Chervak.

“Additionally, it offers invaluable insights for optimizing future data gathering, allowing us to focus on targeted vehicle types, smaller exercises, and leveraging schoolhouse opportunities to develop a robust soldier vibration exposure algorithm,” said Chervak. “Ultimately, these evaluations aim to inform the development of vehicle designs and operational strategies that minimize vibration exposure, thereby enhancing service member lethality, protecting readiness, and optimizing mission success.

The team has also done whole-body vibration exposure studies with rotary wing aircrews.

""A recent evaluation of whole-body vibration exposure among a select group of rotary wing aircrew by the ergonomics group has led to further investigations by the program managers, structural engineers, and manufacturers of the aircraft to determine methodologies for reducing vibration exposures within the aircraft,"" said Chervak.

The ergonomics team is also at the forefront of emerging technology assessment, particularly in evaluating exoskeletons for military applications, said Kevin Purcell, DHA-PH ergonomist. Currently, the ergonomics program is collaborating with endoscopy surgeons at Walter Reed National Military Medical Center in Bethesda, Maryland, to determine whether exoskeleton technology can reduce lower back and shoulder muscle fatigue during medical procedures.

""Exoskeletons hold promise for improving ergonomics and reducing the risk of injuries in workplaces with physically demanding tasks,"" said Purcell. ""However, they need to be implemented in the proper settings that carefully consider both the potential benefits and drawbacks, focusing on user-centered design, proper fitting, and thorough assessment in real-world work environments to maximize their effectiveness and minimize potential risks.""

The Walter Reed project uses Surface-Electromyography, or sEMG, to measure muscle activity during simulated endoscopy tasks performed with and without exoskeletons, said Purcell. This process captures muscle activation signals noninvasively through electrodes placed on the skin over target muscles and provides objective data on the technology's effectiveness in reducing muscle activity.

Customer-driven investigations

The ergonomics team determines focus areas through both systematic processes and direct customer requests. Design reviews are coordinated through the HHA process, where the team receives assignments to review specific equipment for ergonomic risk factors including material handling requirements, force requirements, and vibration exposure.

""Work environment, job hazard analysis evaluations, training, and education initiatives are usually customer driven,"" said Chervak. ""We are either contacted by a unit directly or through a safety and occupational health professional who is responsible for the unit.""

Service members and units can request assistance through the ergonomics website by completing DHA Form 435 [right click to download], or by contacting the team directly. The team works to route requests through appropriate channels to begin direct collaboration with requesting units.

Targeting work-related musculoskeletal disorders

The ergonomics program specifically targets work-related musculoskeletal disorders which include various types of overuse injuries resulting from repetitive stress or excessive use without adequate recovery time, said Chervak. In military settings, these injuries often blur traditional workplace injury definitions.

""Overuse injuries are a part of work-related musculoskeletal disorders because they result from repetitive stress or excessive use without adequate recovery time,"" said Chervak.

Examples of some disorders commonly linked to ergonomic risk factors are musculoskeletal injury to tendons, ligaments, muscles, and joints; degenerative disc disease; herniated discs; pinched nerves; and carpal tunnel syndrome, said Chervak. Specific examples of military-related overuse injuries include rotator cuff injuries prevalent among parachute riggers, and back injuries from lifting mortar shells.

Data-driven approach to prevention

To identify emerging trends and prioritize interventions, the ergonomics team collaborates closely with the DHA-PH’s Injury Prevention Branch, which is part of the Clinical Public Health and Epidemiology directorate, also located at Aberdeen Proving Ground, said Chervak. The Injury Prevention Branch tracks injury trends and uses the Force Risk Reduction management and analysis tool which is managed by the U.S. Army Combat Readiness Center at Fort Rucker, Alabama, to recognize patterns and emerging issues across military installations.

FR2 is available to individuals in the SOH community and human resources community with a government-issued CAC and a .mil email address.

Accessing ergonomic support

Multiple pathways of assistance are available for service members experiencing ergonomic concerns. The primary recommendation is to contact local safety officers, industrial hygienists, or occupational health specialists, who serve as the first line of defense for addressing ergonomic issues, said Chervak.

""If your local team cannot resolve the issue internally or needs additional expertise, they will escalate the matter to our specialized team for advanced assessment and solutions,"" said Chervak. “You can also contact us directly if you prefer or if the situation requires immediate attention. We'll work collaboratively with you and your local SOH team.”

The ergonomics program also develops strategic partnerships with installation SOH personnel. In some cases, an ergonomics team member will virtually attend regularly scheduled SOH meetings, said Lauren Costanzi, DHA-PH ergonomist.

One example of the benefits of this type of collaboration is an effort related to the assembly of a fabric military battery pouch. The SOH office had identified the task as being physically difficult to perform and causing hand and wrist injuries, said Costanzi. The pouch is sewn inside out, which requires it to be flipped right side out prior to shipment. This task requires high-hand forces due to the inflexibility of the stiff fabric. DHA-PH ergonomists measured the forces required to manipulate the battery pouch by using a force gauge to push the corners of the pouch into position. The gauge recorded the peak push force as 42 pounds.

“Ergonomists investigated the use of a home-grade steamer to soften the battery pouch fabric,” said Costanzi. “Softening the fabric reduced the push/pull forces required to manipulate the fabric from inside out to right-side out. Subsequent manipulation of the pouch to turn it right side out resulted in maximum pulling force of 10 pounds, which represents a 67% decrease in the amount of force needed to manipulate the battery pouch.”

Strategic partnerships and standards development

Beyond direct service delivery, the DHA-PH ergonomics program maintains strategic partnerships with professional organizations and standards committees to influence policies affecting military operations, said Chervak. The team actively collaborates with the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs Veterans Health Agency Safe Patient Handling and Mobility and ergonomics programs, the Maryland National Guard, and participates in safe patient handling organizations, human vibration exposure technical advisory groups, and exoskeleton standards committees.

“These partnerships ensure the military can shape standards rather than simply comply with them, preventing increased procurement costs while protecting service member health through proactive engagement in policy development,” said Chervak.

The program also provides digital support to U.S. Army and Department of Defense end users through educational materials, fact sheets, policy guidance, professional publications, and regular updates to military ergonomics guidance documents.

Here are some ways that resilience supports personal readiness and promotes warfighter lethality.
Resilience: An X-factor in warfighter lethality and personal readiness Enhancing situational awareness: Combat environments are often intense; stress and anxiety can cloud judgment and narrow focus.
Physical resilience supports mental resilience.
To maintain personal readiness, resilience involves not only the capacity to rebound from setbacks but also sustainable and flexible abilities, referred to as adaptive resilience.","Richard Barton, who retired from the U.S Army in 2012, holds a doctorate in clinical social work, has served as a U.S. Army brigade behavioral health officer, and as chief of social work services while assigned to Fort Sill, Oklahoma. His primary focus at Defense Health Agency-Public Health is on behavioral health and suicide prevention.

While lethality is often connected with firepower and tactical know-how, there is a human component that supports warfighter lethality and readiness: resilience. For service members, resilience is not only about bouncing back; it’s about developing mental flexibility, having the ability to regulate emotions, and maintaining focus under stressful situations that enhance individual readiness. Here are some ways that resilience supports personal readiness and promotes warfighter lethality.

The Department of Defense defines personal readiness as the ability to perform effectively and efficiently in all aspects of life, particularly in military contexts. This includes five dimensions of personal readiness:

Physical: Maintaining a healthy lifestyle, including proper nutrition and exercise

Emotional: Recognizing and managing emotions, including resilience to handle stress and adversity

Social: Building and maintaining strong relationships, both personally and professionally

Spiritual: Cultivating a sense of purpose and personal values that guide one's actions and decisions

Family: Supporting and maintaining healthy relationships within the family unit

These dimensions are essential for sustaining personal readiness and overall well-being.

Resilience: An X-factor in warfighter lethality and personal readiness

Enhancing situational awareness:

Combat environments are often intense; stress and anxiety can cloud judgment and narrow focus. However, resiliency can help leaders and their warfighters better manage natural stress responses, improve awareness levels, and develop an ability to make quicker and more accurate decisions under duress. Enhancing individual resiliency improves situational awareness and supports personal readiness.

Optimizing performance under pressure:

When in a combat situation, stress hormones surge, triggering many biological changes. Realistic operational training helps to optimize personal readiness and resilience by providing leaders and warfighters opportunities to successfully manage their responses and channel them effectively, supporting their ability to maintain composure, stay focused, and utilize fine motor skills during intense situations.

Learning rapid recovery and adaptation:

The combat environment is dynamic. Challenging training scenarios help leaders and warfighters learn from their failures and adapt in rapidly evolving situations. Resiliency is enhanced by exposure to uncomfortable training environments, which helps promote learning how to recover from setbacks and overcome complex challenges. Learning to think critically and quickly adapt to new situations are keys to mission success.

Sustaining the will to fight on:

Learning to be comfortable with discomfort helps to provide a firm sense of purpose and determination when facing physical and mental hardships. Physical resilience supports mental resilience. The ability to think clearly and adjust to the effects of an intense operational tempo is influenced by individual levels of physical fitness; a fit body supports personal readiness.

Cohesion supports resiliency:

Resilience can be contagious. A team composed of resilient individuals is more likely to sustain its cohesion, develop trust, and maintain morale in extreme circumstances. Team cohesion can translate into seamless teamwork, effective communication, and a shared commitment to accomplishing the mission, ultimately increasing the team’s readiness.

To maintain personal readiness, resilience involves not only the capacity to rebound from setbacks but also sustainable and flexible abilities, referred to as adaptive resilience. Likewise, resilience is not based on a single strength. Here are some examples of how units develop and maintain resilience:

U.S. Navy SEALs and submarine crews demonstrate adaptive resilience through extended underwater deployments, where they must manage isolation, confined spaces, and make mission-critical decisions under extreme pressure.

Pilots and aircrew develop resilience through high-altitude training and split-second, decision-making scenarios where maintaining focus and fine motor skills can mean the difference between mission success and failure.

U.S. Marine Corps units exemplify resilience through amphibious assault training, where they must rapidly adapt from sea-based operations to ground combat while maintaining unit cohesion across diverse operational environments.

U.S. Space Force operators build resilience through training in cyber-warfare simulations and satellite operations, where mental agility and emotional regulation are crucial for protecting national security infrastructure.

U.S. Army medics develop adaptive resilience through high-stress medical simulation training that replicates the chaos of battlefield casualty care, where they learn to optimize performance under pressure.

The foundations of resilience are established during initial training, optimized further by the challenges faced during the duty day, in reality-based training, and during deployments. Those who develop adaptive resilience are better equipped with the behavioral and physical traits needed to overcome challenging conditions and events.

A resilient force is a lethal force. By cultivating resilience as a core competency, we not only enhance our well-being but also improve the readiness and lethality of our military.

Future of drone warfare Navy Capt.","SEPTEMBER 17, 2025 – The 2025 Military Health System Research Symposium featured an in-depth plenary panel on “Drone Warfare and the New Resilience Paradigm” Aug. 4, featuring speakers from Ukraine’s military health system, the Walter Reed Army Institute of Research, the United States Indo-Pacific Command, the Defense Health Agency’s Joint Trauma System, and civilian health care organizations.

Dr. Terry Rauch, director of research and development for the Office of the Assistant Secretary of War for Health Affairs, moderated the panel with Army Col. (Dr.) John Holcomb, professor of surgery at the Uniformed Services University, Bethesda, Maryland.

“As professional scientists and innovators, we’re tasked with preparing for the evolving character of war,” said Holcomb. He noted that millions of drones are in production, with thousands already flying.

Evolving physical threats

Ukrainian armed forces Col. (Dr.) Kostiantyn Gumeniuk, chief surgeon for medical forces, said expensive armored equipment can be disabled by drones. He noted today’s Ukrainian medics now treat amputations, severe tissue damage, and burns from missiles, chemical weapons, and drones — urging researchers to address more severe injuries.

“Today’s war is a war of drones, so we need to develop a new surgical tactic for these kinds of injuries,” he said.

Ukrainian Maj. (Dr.) Dmytro Samofalov, acting head of the health department, Ministry of Defense of Ukraine, added that drones are changing the geography of war — putting civilians, ambulances, and hospitals at risk. He shared examples where civilian ambulances, drivers, and paramedics have been targeted and struck by enemy drones.

He said, “Even being [away from the] frontlines, you are still not safe. A lot of our military guys who [have been] in [secure] positions who thought they were safe [have been] wounded by drones.”

Psychological toll

Dr. Oleh Berezyuk, director, psychological direction and psychosocial rehabilitation, Unbroken, First Medical Union Hospital Lviv, Ukraine, described the “sharp, drastic increase in military and civilian personnel suffering from psychological effects of drone warfare”. He said that 70% of patients are reporting signs of burnout, 38% have posttraumatic stress disorder, and 11% have suicidal ideation.

Dr. Amy Adler, clinical research psychologist and senior scientist with WRAIR’s Center for Military Psychiatry and Neuroscience in Silver Spring, Maryland, noted acute stress reactions, or “freezing” in action, are a “normal, understandable response to a traumatic stressor” likely to increase with the growing threat of drone attacks.

Adler identified a peer-support tool called “iCOVER” developed by WRAIR and the Israeli Defense Forces. The tool helps teammates guide someone through a reaction by naming “what [has] happened, what is happening, what will happen,” she said, before requesting a simple action to break paralysis. She emphasized that this is one of many tools in development designed to support the psychological health of warfighters and providers facing mounting drone threats.

Future of drone warfare

Navy Capt. (Dr.) Peter Roberts, command surgeon, USINDOPACOM, explained that drones could be vital for biothreat surveillance, battle damage assessment, and sea-to-shore kit delivery. However, he urged researchers to address limitations due to cost concerns, payload and range restrictions, autonomy, and weather resilience.

Panelists agreed on several priorities to prepare warfighters and mitigate the impact of drone warfare:

Improve training, including advanced trauma life support for medics managing complex battlefield injuries

Better prepare for attacks on non-combatant targets as drones slip past the frontlines of conflict

Prioritize mental health, by offering real-time counseling on the frontlines and better training in diagnosis, stress management, and self-regulation

Simulate realistic stressors during training

Army Col. (Dr.) Jennifer Gurney, chief, DHA’s Joint Trauma System, emphasized that “technology will indeed punish the unskilled on the next battlefield.” She also encouraged participants to study resilience, saying, “How can we come home stronger?

Getting your Trinity Audio player ready...

By Mike Causey

Whether you’re active duty, a reservist or a military family member, choosing the right health or life insurance plans can feel like you are navigating a minefield. Here are some things to consider before signing on the dotted line.

Health insurance

If you are on active duty for more than 30 days, good news: You and your dependents should be covered by military health care. But here’s the fine print:

Dependents can access medical and dental care at military facilities. Availability may vary.

TRICARE offers civilian health benefits funded by the federal government. Your military unit can help with the details.

If you’re leaving a civilian job for military service, federal laws like COBRA (the Consolidated Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act) and USERRA (the Uniformed Services Employment and Reemployment Rights Act of 1994) protect your right to continue employer-based health coverage for up to 24 months.

If your service is for 30 days or less, you’ll pay the same rate you previously paid. If it’s longer, you may need to cover the full premium plus a 2% administration fee.

If you’ve lost coverage through your employer, thanks to HIPPA (the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act), you might qualify to enroll in your spouse’s group health plan. But don’t wait. Time limits apply.

Life insurance

Before buying life insurance, especially on base, make sure the agent is legit:

They need permission from the Department of Defense to sell on military installations.

They must be licensed by the Department of Insurance. Ask to see the agent’s permits and licenses to be sure the agent is legitimate.

Many private insurance carriers do not offer coverage for acts of war. But SGLI – the Service Members’ Group Life Insurance program – has your back. It’s affordable and includes coverage for death due to acts of war.

If you have coverage elsewhere, double-check with your agent to avoid overlapping policies. You might be paying for insurance coverage you already have.

Need help?

Your flight, payroll or finance office can help provide details on premium payment and refund issues. For claims, reach out to the Office of Service Members’ Group Life Insurance (OSGLI).

And remember, my team at the Department of Insurance is here for you. Call us weekdays from 8 a.m. to 5 p.m. by calling 855-408-1212 or visit www.ncdoi.gov.

To our service members and families: Thank you for your sacrifice. We’re honored to serve you as you serve our country.

Mike Causey is the insurance commissioner for North Carolina.

Another key stop was the Joint Trauma System, the DoD’s center of excellence for trauma care delivery.
""The San Antonio Military Health System's commitment to readiness and its ability to deliver comprehensive, world-class care is truly impressive,” Smith said.
Putnam, a BAMC institution with 70 years of civil service, has dedicated 65 of those years to the medical center.
Johnson and showcase the diverse capabilities and unwavering dedication of the San Antonio Military Health System,” Harrell said.","JOINT BASE SAN ANTONIO, Texas, Sept. 17, 2025 – From the military’s only Level I Trauma Center to the specialized clinic serving all Air Force basic trainees, senior leaders from the Defense Health Agency gained firsthand insights into the critical contributions of the San Antonio military medical system during a recent site visit.

Acting DHA Director, Dr. David Smith, and DHA’s senior enlisted leader, Air Force Chief Master Sgt. Tanya Johnson, visited multiple clinics and sites across Joint Base San Antonio, underscoring the local healthcare system’s pivotal role in supporting the warfighter and caring for those who serve.

The health system is renowned for its extensive capabilities, boasting the only DoD Burn Center, Level I Trauma Center and rooftop helipad, as well as the largest medical facility in the Military Health System. It’s also the largest force-generating platform, hosting training for more than 700 military officers in 36 graduate medical education and 22 graduate allied health education specialty programs through the San Antonio Uniformed Services Health Education Consortium.

""SAMHS stands as a cornerstone of military medicine, providing unparalleled capabilities in trauma care, burn treatment, and medical education,"" said Air Force Maj. Gen. Thomas Harrell, director of Defense Health Network Central, and commander, Medical Readiness Command Alpha. ""Its unique combination of resources and expertise makes it an indispensable asset to our nation's defense and the well-being of our service members.""

During their visit to Brooke Army Medical Center, the leaders toured the emergency department, rooftop helipad, and the Institute of Surgical Research Burn Center, which is the only American Burn Association-verified burn center in South Texas. The BAMC ED serves as the entry point to its Level I Trauma Center, which administers care to civilian and military trauma patients from an area spanning 22 counties and approximately 2.2 million people.

This community trauma partnership is a “win-win” collaboration, Smith noted, as it provides world-class care to the community while enhancing the readiness of military medical personnel.

The next day, Smith and Johnson toured Wilford Hall Ambulatory Surgical Center and Reid Clinic, where Air Force basic military trainees were in-processing during week one of their training. Reid Clinic provides medical care to over 86,000 Air Force and Space Force basic military trainees and technical training students each year, highlighting the system's commitment to force generation and maintaining a healthy fighting force.

The DHA leaders also expressed interest in the DoD’s only extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) program. ECMO is a heart-lung bypass system that replaces the natural functions of the heart and lungs while treatments and healing of the affected organs take place. The joint-service ECMO team, based at BAMC, possesses the capability for global transports of warfighters, as well as the ability to transport civilian emergency patients through the Secretarial Designee program.

Another key stop was the Joint Trauma System, the DoD’s center of excellence for trauma care delivery. JTS supports combatant commands with trauma system planning, treatment and management. JTS also oversees DoD’s sole trauma patient registry, which collects comprehensive data on combat casualty care -- from the point of injury to recovery – to improve outcomes and inform best practices.

Throughout the visit, Smith emphasized his commitment to understanding the challenges faced by the local system, including staffing, resource and budgetary challenges, and pledged to explore solutions from a senior leadership perspective to ensure the system can continue to meet its critical mission requirements.

""The San Antonio Military Health System's commitment to readiness and its ability to deliver comprehensive, world-class care is truly impressive,” Smith said. “We're here to listen, learn, and ensure our medical professionals have the resources and support they need to continue excelling in their vital mission. Their dedication to both the warfighter and the community is unwavering, and we are committed to supporting them in every way we can.""

Smith also recognized several exceptional personnel with coins, expressing his appreciation for their hard work and dedication to the mission of providing world-class healthcare and supporting military readiness.

Of note, the director presented a coin to Army Lt. Col. Adrianna Long, core faculty for the Emergency Medicine Residency at BAMC, for her efforts to augment the Emergency Operations Center after the catastrophic flooding along the Guadalupe River over the Fourth of July weekend. The flash floods claimed at least 135 lives in the Texas Hill Country.

A highlight of the visit was the director's congratulatory remarks to Carolyn Putnam, executive secretary to the BAMC commander, on her 90th birthday. Putnam, a BAMC institution with 70 years of civil service, has dedicated 65 of those years to the medical center.

Conclusion: A Defensive Play in a High-Growth Sector Senzime's strategic alignment with U.S. defense healthcare innovation offers a unique blend of revenue security and growth potential.
As the DoD and civilian healthcare systems continue to prioritize patient safety, Senzime's TetraGraph system stands as a testament to the power of defensive innovation in an increasingly complex healthcare landscape.","In the evolving landscape of healthcare technology, Senzime AB has emerged as a pivotal player in neuromuscular monitoring, leveraging its proprietary TetraGraph system to redefine patient safety standards. The company's recent foray into U.S. defense healthcare, marked by a contract with the Department of Defense (DoD) and Walter Reed National Military Medical Center, underscores its strategic pivot toward contract-driven revenue security and alignment with national defense priorities. This move not only solidifies Senzime's market position but also positions it as a beneficiary of the U.S. military's push for advanced medical technologies.

Defensive Healthcare Innovation: A Gold Standard in Neuromuscular Monitoring

Senzime's TetraGraph system, which employs electromyography (EMG) technology, has been adopted as the clinical gold standard for neuromuscular monitoring in countries such as the U.S., Japan, and South KoreaSenzime provides market update and outlines high growth ambitions[ 1 ]. This technology enables anesthesiologists to quantitatively assess neuromuscular function during surgeries involving paralytic drugs, reducing complications such as residual paralysis. The Japanese Society of Anesthesiology's 2025 updated guidelines further reinforced the global relevance of EMG-based monitoring, aligning with Senzime's clinical evidence and accelerating its adoptionSenzime welcomes new Japanese guidelines on neuromuscular monitoring[ 4 ].

The U.S. military's selection of TetraGraph for deployment at Walter Reed National Military Medical Center—a key node in the DoD's Military Health System—highlights the system's strategic value. Walter Reed serves active-duty personnel, veterans, and their families, making patient safety a critical prioritySenzime Awarded Contract to Supply the U.S. Department of Defense and Walter Reed National Military Medical Center[ 3 ]. By standardizing neuromuscular monitoring across its operating rooms, the DoD is addressing a long-standing gap in perioperative care, particularly for service members who may face unique surgical risks due to combat-related injuries or chronic conditions.

Contract-Driven Revenue Security: A Shield Against Market Volatility

Senzime's U.S. defense contracts offer a compelling case for revenue stability. While the exact financial terms of the DoD agreement remain undisclosed, the contract includes an expected annual purchase volume of over 5,000 TetraSens sensorsSenzime Awarded Contract to Supply the U.S. Department of Defense and Walter Reed National Military Medical Center[ 3 ]. These sensors, essential for the TetraGraph system's functionality, represent a recurring revenue stream that insulates Senzime from the volatility of one-time equipment sales.

This model mirrors the company's success in civilian healthcare markets, where it has secured contracts with leading Integrated Delivery Networks (IDNs) and university hospital systems. For instance, a major Texas-based hospital system has committed to deploying 63 TetraGraph monitors and collaborating on quality improvement (QI) initiatives to standardize neuromuscular monitoring for 27,000 patients annuallySenzime provides market update and outlines high growth ambitions[ 1 ]. Similarly, a Northeastern IDN has ordered 60 systems, with potential to serve 20,000 patients yearlySenzime Secures Additional US Hospital System Contracts[ 2 ]. These contracts, awarded after rigorous clinical evaluations, reflect the TetraGraph's proven efficacy and its alignment with recent U.S. clinical guidelinesSenzime provides market update and outlines high growth ambitions[ 1 ].

The DoD contract adds a layer of strategic value beyond revenue. Walter Reed's adoption of TetraGraph signals broader acceptance within the U.S. military healthcare system, potentially paving the way for future contracts with other military medical centers. This “defense anchor” effect could accelerate Senzime's market penetration, as the credibility of military healthcare adoption often spills over into civilian institutions.

Strategic Implications for Investors

Senzime's expansion into defense healthcare aligns with its long-term ambition to become the global leader in EMG-based neuromuscular monitoring. With over 4,150 TetraGraph systems shipped globally as of 2025Senzime | Precision-based patient monitoring[ 5 ], the company is well-positioned to capitalize on the phase-out of legacy electromechanical (AMG) systems. The U.S. military's investment in this technology further validates Senzime's clinical and commercial proposition, particularly as healthcare systems worldwide prioritize data-driven patient safety.

For investors, the combination of high-margin sensor sales, recurring QI collaborations, and defense contracts creates a resilient revenue model. While the absence of disclosed contract values for the DoD agreement introduces some uncertainty, the expected sensor volume and Walter Reed's prominence in the Military Health System suggest significant upside. Additionally, Senzime's recent contracts with civilian IDNs—covering over 100,000 patients annually—demonstrate its ability to scale in competitive marketsSenzime Secures Additional US Hospital System Contracts[ 2 ].

Conclusion: A Defensive Play in a High-Growth Sector

Senzime's strategic alignment with U.S. defense healthcare innovation offers a unique blend of revenue security and growth potential. By addressing a critical gap in perioperative care through its EMG-based technology, the company has secured contracts that not only stabilize its financial outlook but also position it at the forefront of a global shift toward evidence-based medical practices.

“Military families likely encounter more administrative barriers to accessing ABA services than civilian families,” the researchers stated in their report.
“The concern is, military families have spent at least 10 years in a demonstration.
The committee included experts in behavior analysis, child development, public health, psychology, health services, biostatistics and autism research.
Along with many other experts, military families receiving ABA and military family advocacy organizations would be included on the advisory council.","Defense Health Agency officials should formally authorize Applied Behavior Analysis, a widely recognized intervention to help children with autism, as a basic Tricare benefit, according to a report on the findings of a congressionally mandated independent study.

The report, conducted by the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering and Medicine, debunks DHA officials’ repeated assertion that ABA services don’t meet their standards for reliable medical evidence.

The researchers lay out their analysis of why ABA meets Tricare’s own standards, defined in law.

Researchers recommend this major shift in Tricare’s policies for military family members diagnosed with autism spectrum disorder, citing problems with an 11-year-old demonstration project that in effect limits the care available for these children.

“It’s time for ABA to be a basic benefit in the Defense Health Agency,” said Dr. Eric Flake, a retired Air Force colonel who is a member of the committee that conducted the study, during a webinar Tuesday.

Each month, about 1,000 military children receive diagnoses of autism, said Flake, who is adjunct faculty at the DOD Developmental-Behavioral Pediatrics Fellowship at Joint Base Lewis McChord, Washington, and an associate professor at the Uniformed Services University of the Health Sciences and the University of Washington.

The researchers, in their 310-page report released Sept. 9, recommend that DHA end its Autism Care Demonstration program, citing some policies that differ from clinical best practices and impose excessive administrative burdens on military families and ABA providers.

The policies limit providers’ ability to target some skills essential to health and well-being, such as self-care tasks known as “activities of daily living.” The policies also restrict providers from providing ABA services in schools and community settings.

While Tricare covers multiple services for beneficiaries diagnosed with autism spectrum disorder, ABA is specifically offered to military-connected families only through the demonstration program, which began in 2014.

Tricare doesn’t authorize ABA services as a “basic benefit,” meaning a covered service that is determined medically necessary as defined by law.

“Military families likely encounter more administrative barriers to accessing ABA services than civilian families,” the researchers stated in their report. “Families expressed appreciation for ABA, but also reported stress and confusion about accessing care due to delays and complex requirements.”

DOD considers National Academies report

The committee also recommended DHA reduce administrative barriers that limit families’ access to ABA services. Families often express concern that the current policies related to ABA are discriminatory.

Autism is the only diagnosis for which family members are required to enroll in the Exceptional Family Member Program and Extended Care Health Option (ECHO) in order to get access to medically recommended care, committee member Jennifer Penhale, an active-duty Air Force spouse and mother to three teenagers with autism, said during the webinar. Penhale chairs the Colorado Developmental Disabilities Council.

The research committee noted that ABA is now standard practice for many autistic individuals across public and private health systems. Since 2019, all states have adopted laws or issued regulatory guidance requiring certain commercial health plans to cover ABA services for people with autism, they reported.

The two-year study found that in spite of defense health officials’ repeated assertions that Applied Behavior Analysis services don’t meet DOD’s standards for reliable medical evidence, ABA does in fact meet DOD’s own standards.

DOD's conclusions flawed about military children's progress with autism therapy, expert says,

Yet in their most recent report to Congress, dated Aug. 19, Defense Health Agency officials stated, “As of now, ABA services do not meet the Tricare hierarchy of reliable evidence standard for proven medical care.”

The Defense Health Agency is reviewing the entire National Academies report, including the recommendations, “to determine our way forward with the Autism Care Demonstration,” officials said in response to questions from Military Times. “Until this review is completed, the Department will continue to provide the services available under the ACD.”

Recommendations remove ‘a lot of barriers’

Dr. Kristi Cabiao, CEO and president of Mission Alpha Advocacy, an organization that advocates for military families within the Exceptional Family Member Program, praised the National Academies committee for its extensive work.

“Here you have this expert committee that says by DOD’s own standards of reliable medical evidence, it’s been met,” Cabiao, the wife of an Air Force retiree and mother of a child with autism, told Military Times.

“The concern is, military families have spent at least 10 years in a demonstration. That’s time that these families will never get back. They had to receive a lower quality ABA services because of really poor policies.”

The National Academies study included a comprehensive review of empirical literature, an analysis of Tricare claims data from 2018 to 2023, an evaluation of policies and procedures and input from military families, researchers and ABA providers.

The committee included experts in behavior analysis, child development, public health, psychology, health services, biostatistics and autism research.

The researchers’ recommendation that DHA formally authorize ABA as a Tricare basic benefit “is the most important recommendation for military families,” said Cabiao. ”It removes a lot of barriers.”

Duty to protect: It's time to remove barriers to autism services for military children

For example, active-duty families would no longer be mandated to enroll in EFMP and ECHO, she said. “We have families who weren’t able to start ABA services right away, having delays of months because of this administrative burden.”

Cementing ABA as a Tricare benefit would also eliminate the worry of a looming 2028 deadline, when the ABA demonstration program is scheduled to end.

“When you’re depending on this really life-saving service, as it was for my child ... to know that in 2028 it might continue or it might not, or may be even more restricted, you don’t have security in what the future holds,” Cabiao said.

Aspects of the military lifestyle, such as frequent moves and caregiver deployments, can disrupt the stability children with autism need in their care.

One military parent told researchers there’s a two-year waitlist just to be evaluated in El Paso, Texas, “which is absurd for those families that have to change duty stations frequently. This means they will never get the chance to be seen,” the parent is quoted as saying in the report.

Autism rates among military children

In DHA’s annual report to Congress dated Aug. 19, officials said that in fiscal 2023, there were 16,747 beneficiaries with diagnoses of autism participating in the demonstration program, at a cost of $435 million. The average paid cost per participant was $25,948.

While it’s difficult to compare the prevalence of autism between the military community and the general population, the National Academies researchers cited one recent review that identified 1 in every 28 military children, or 3.5%, as being diagnosed with autism in the period from 2019 to 2023.

That rate is slightly higher than the rate in the general population of 1 in 31 children with autism diagnoses, or 3.2%, in 2022, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

Cabiao cautions against reading too much into the 0.3% gap between military and civilian populations, stating the difference is minimal and could be partly explained by the consistent system of medical records that keep track of military children’s health care.

Still, she said, “One in 28 is a big number. It clearly demonstrates a readiness and retention issue if we don’t provide quality ABA services.”

During the six-year period from calendar years 2018 to 2023, there were 109,073 children ages 1 to 18 with an autism diagnosis who were eligible for Tricare benefits, according to the committee’s report.

During that time, about one-third of those children had a claim for ABA services. More than half were under age 6, and 89% were under age 12. About four out of five beneficiaries participating in the demonstration are male.

‘New territory’ for the DOD

Other recommendations included in the committee’s report are: aligning Tricare coverage of ABA with clinical best practices; eliminating mandatory assessments that don’t support treatment planning; and establishing an independent advisory council to help guide the transition. Along with many other experts, military families receiving ABA and military family advocacy organizations would be included on the advisory council.

Flake, the retired colonel who sits on the committee, highlighted DHA’s “continued desire to see best practices come forward” in the field of autism treatment over the years.

He noted that many of the recommendations the committee made for DHA to transition from its demonstration program are already put into practice as standard care in other locations.

“We recognize that we may be going into some new territory for DHA, but that also isn’t new for us as a military community,” Flake said. “I have full confidence that with the support of the ABA community, with the support of families and parents, as well as policymakers and guidance from the recommendations of this report, that it can be a relatively smooth transition.”",https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/OuyA02TN2EcTnZuZFPdFOA--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyMDA7aD04ODU7Y2Y9d2VicA--/https://media.zenfs.com/en/military_times_968/f7dd32c49a2edd988a2effcd2dac6452,N,0.0,2025-09-17 15:56:29.764091

Hegseth reposted the screenshot with the caption: “Pronouns UPDATED: She/Her/Fired.” A U.S. defense official confirmed Marra’s removal, citing a loss of confidence in her leadership and possible misuse of social media.

KPBS reports a Navy official says Hegseth ordered the firing; the Military Times does not say who ordered it.

Did the position cited on her profile exist?

Defense officials said the position referenced on Marra’s LinkedIn never formally existed. The Biden administration considered tying the role to a proposed Transgender Health Center within the Defense Health Agency but later abandoned the plan, according to The Military Times.

A Defense Health Agency spokesperson told Military Times, “The Department does not have a Transgender Health Center.”

The official said planners asked services to nominate personnel, and Marra was among those nominees. Why she listed the role on her profile remains unclear.

How have others responded?

Marra has not commented publicly since her removal. Col. Bree Fram, one of the highest-ranking openly transgender officers in the U.S. military and an advocate for transgender service members, called the decision “really disappointing” in remarks to Military Times.

Fram said Marra was targeted over a Navy-assigned role from the past. The Military Times reported the position was never filled.

In an interview with KPBS, Fram described Marra as “an exceptionally qualified doctor who was responsible for taking care of a huge number of sailors and Marines.” Fram also said she has faced threats after being targeted by Libs of TikTok.

What is the broader policy context?

The firing comes as the Trump administration enforces an executive order banning all transgender service members and ending gender-affirming care.

The amendments, which target LGBTQ visibility and transgender health care in particular, were passed on largely party-line votes in the House of Representatives, causing Democrats to cry foul.

U.S. Rep. Mark Takano, chair of the Congressional Equality Caucus, accused Republicans of sacrificing bipartisan support for the NDAA by politicizing the process to curry favor with President Donald Trump and socially conservative voters. He warned that, if enacted, the amendments would harm transgender service members, cadets, and dependents of military personnel.

“Congress should be fighting for those who fight for us — but it’s clear the GOP has other priorities,” he said.

The first amendment, introduced by U.S. Rep. Ralph Norman (R-S.C.) and approved by roll call vote, prohibits children of service members enrolled in the Exceptional Family Member Program from accessing or being referred for gender-affirming treatments. It also bars reassigning service members to a different duty station to ensure their dependents can obtain treatments such as puberty blockers, hormones, or surgeries.

Four vulnerable Democrats from Republican-leaning or swing districts — Reps. Henry Cuellar (Texas), Vicente Gonzalez (Texas), Don Davis (N.C.), and Adam Gray (Calif.) — voted for the rider. Only one Republican, Del. Kimberlyn King-Hinds of the Northern Mariana Islands, voted against it.

Four amendments came from Rep. Nancy Mace (R-S.C.), who has positioned herself as a leading critic of transgender rights in Congress, arguing that she is defending women’s rights and children from policies she claims put them at risk.

One of Mace’s amendments bans all transition-related health care for transgender service members — even if considered “medically necessary” — as well as for dependents. It would bar TRICARE, the military’s main insurance program, from covering puberty blockers, hormone therapy, or surgeries for adults. It would also expand the existing prohibition on TRICARE coverage for dependents under 18 to include mental health services for youth with gender dysphoria.

Six Democrats — Cuellar, Gonzalez, Davis, Gray, Shomari Figures (Ala.), and Cleo Fields (La.) — voted for the ban on transition-related and mental health care. Two Republicans, King-Hinds and Rep. David Joyce (Ohio), opposed it.

Mace’s other amendments include banning transgender athletes at U.S. service academies from competing in female athletic programs; prohibiting the Pentagon from collecting data on service members’ gender identity in any form or survey; and blocking transgender individuals from using single-sex facilities on military bases not designated for their sex, defined by “reproductive system.”

All Republicans backed the transgender sports ban, while King-Hinds opposed both the data collection and facilities bans.

Ten Democrats — including Laura Gillen, John Mannion, and Tom Suozzi of New York; Jared Golden of Maine; Susie Lee of Nevada; and Kim Schrier and Marie Gluesenkamp Perez, both of Washington — supported the sports ban. Four Democrats — Cuellar, Davis, Gonzalez, and Gray — backed the data collection ban, while three voted for the facilities ban.

The final amendment, from Rep. Cory Mills (R-Fla.), bans Pride flags from being flown at Department of Defense facilities. It removes a 2024 NDAA provision that let military leaders approve certain flags — a policy critics said still allowed Pride flags to be displayed.

Five Democrats — Cuellar, Davis, Gillen, Golden, and Perez — supported the flag ban. Two Republicans, Del. Jim Moylan of American Samoa and Rep. Mike Lawler of New York, opposed it.

Luke Schleusener, CEO of Out in National Security, a nonpartisan group advocating for queer national security professionals, condemned the NDAA in its current form.

He called it “rife with cruel, bigoted amendments that undermine that common defense” and “an insult to the responsibilities of Congress and the traditions of the House Armed Services Committee.”

According to Schleusener, the current version of the NDAA “does not make America safer, or the Armed Forces stronger or more capable in a complex and dangerous world. If passed into law, this will harm recruitment, retention, and readiness across the uniformed services and the DOD civilian workforce. It dishonors the past and present service and sacrifice of thousands of Americans — and their children.”",https://www.metroweekly.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Trans-military-Adobe-Firefly.jpg,N,0.0,2025-09-17 12:56:13.858233

Three-pronged approach to injury prevention

The DHA-PH ergonomics team accomplishes its mission through three primary focus areas: design reviews, worksite assessments, and training and education initiatives.

Design reviews, frequently conducted through the health hazard assessment process, aim to incorporate ergonomic principles into the acquisition process to ensure purchased or developed equipment is designed for optimal human performance prior to fielding.

“This proactive approach allows the team to identify and address potential injury risks before equipment reaches service members,” said Chervak.

Worksite assessments use job hazard analysis and biomechanical assessment techniques to optimize performance by improving human-machine interaction. These assessments focus on reducing ergonomic risk factors such as excessive force generation, repetitive motions, and exposure to vibration while optimizing posture for various military tasks, said Chervak.

“We assess a wide variety of work environments, including military hospitals and clinics, clinical care and laboratory settings, laundry and dining services, and industrial environments from cable assembly to paint booths and vehicle maintenance,” said Pentikis. “We also assess musculoskeletal -specific tasks such as weapons loading, litter carrying, parachute rigging, and load carriage.”

The training and education component involves multiple audiences, from teaching occupational health and safety personnel to perform worksite assessments to instructing service members on proper lifting and material handling techniques, said Chervak. The program also provides equipment-specific and site-specific training while educating leadership on ergonomic principles.

“For example, the ergonomics program recently developed specific ergonomic trainings in the areas of dining services, vehicle mechanics, emergency medical technicians, laboratories, and health care environments at the request of customers,” said Chervak.

The ergonomics team continually assesses ergonomics concerns as new equipment is developed.

“There are always new patient care environments, equipment, and circumstances to be assessed for safe patient handling and mobility, and the majority of work environments across the military place workers and military members at some level of musculoskeletal disorder risk,” said Kelsey McCoskey, a DHA-PH ergonomist. “Each time a depot mission changes, and a new system or equipment is being built or refurbished, the ergonomic risk factors change. Helping the local safety and occupational health personnel to continuously identify, prioritize, and remediate these work-related musculoskeletal risks is part of our mission.”

Real-world impact on military operations

Recent ergonomics evaluations have highlighted the direct impact our program can have on service members’ lethality, readiness, and equipment development, said Chervak.

""Studies have established a link between exposure to high levels of whole-body vibration and slowed reaction times,” said Chervak. “In combat scenarios, this delay can be the difference between life and death, especially when rapidly exiting a vehicle and returning fire. However, until now, the levels of whole-body vibration experienced by service members operating in military vehicles during realistic training and operational environments remained largely unknown.”

To address this critical knowledge gap, Chervak and McCoskey collaborated with the National Guard Bureau’s Office of the Joint Surgeon to pilot whole-body vibration exposure data collection on opposing force military vehicles during a recent Operation Northern Strike training exercise. This effort provides crucial data towards characterizing the whole-body vibration exposure soldiers face on missions, said Chervak.

“Additionally, it offers invaluable insights for optimizing future data gathering, allowing us to focus on targeted vehicle types, smaller exercises, and leveraging schoolhouse opportunities to develop a robust soldier vibration exposure algorithm,” said Chervak. “Ultimately, these evaluations aim to inform the development of vehicle designs and operational strategies that minimize vibration exposure, thereby enhancing service member lethality, protecting readiness, and optimizing mission success.

The team has also done whole-body vibration exposure studies with rotary wing aircrews.

""A recent evaluation of whole-body vibration exposure among a select group of rotary wing aircrew by the ergonomics group has led to further investigations by the program managers, structural engineers, and manufacturers of the aircraft to determine methodologies for reducing vibration exposures within the aircraft,"" said Chervak.

The ergonomics team is also at the forefront of emerging technology assessment, particularly in evaluating exoskeletons for military applications, said Kevin Purcell, DHA-PH ergonomist. Currently, the ergonomics program is collaborating with endoscopy surgeons at Walter Reed National Military Medical Center [https://walterreed.tricare.mil/] in Bethesda, Maryland, to determine whether exoskeleton technology can reduce lower back and shoulder muscle fatigue during medical procedures.

""Exoskeletons hold promise for improving ergonomics and reducing the risk of injuries in workplaces with physically demanding tasks,"" said Purcell. ""However, they need to be implemented in the proper settings that carefully consider both the potential benefits and drawbacks, focusing on user-centered design, proper fitting, and thorough assessment in real-world work environments to maximize their effectiveness and minimize potential risks.""

The Walter Reed project uses Surface-Electromyography, or sEMG, to measure muscle activity during simulated endoscopy tasks performed with and without exoskeletons, said Purcell. This process captures muscle activation signals noninvasively through electrodes placed on the skin over target muscles and provides objective data on the technology's effectiveness in reducing muscle activity.

Customer-driven investigations

The ergonomics team determines focus areas through both systematic processes and direct customer requests. Design reviews are coordinated through the HHA process, where the team receives assignments to review specific equipment for ergonomic risk factors including material handling requirements, force requirements, and vibration exposure.

""Work environment, job hazard analysis evaluations, training, and education initiatives are usually customer driven,"" said Chervak. ""We are either contacted by a unit directly or through a safety and occupational health professional who is responsible for the unit.""

Service members and units can request assistance through the ergonomics website by completing DHA Form 435 [right click to download], or by contacting [https://ph.health.mil/Pages/Contact.aspx] the team directly. The team works to route requests through appropriate channels to begin direct collaboration with requesting units.

Targeting work-related musculoskeletal disorders

The ergonomics program specifically targets work-related musculoskeletal disorders which include various types of overuse injuries resulting from repetitive stress or excessive use without adequate recovery time, said Chervak. In military settings, these injuries often blur traditional workplace injury definitions.

""Overuse injuries are a part of work-related musculoskeletal disorders because they result from repetitive stress or excessive use without adequate recovery time,"" said Chervak.

Examples of some disorders commonly linked to ergonomic risk factors are musculoskeletal injury to tendons, ligaments, muscles, and joints; degenerative disc disease; herniated discs; pinched nerves; and carpal tunnel syndrome, said Chervak. Specific examples of military-related overuse injuries [https://dha.mil/News/2025/04/11/14/06/Reducing-impact-of-upper-extremity-injuries-with-early-diagnosis-occupational-therapy] include rotator cuff injuries prevalent among parachute riggers, and back injuries from lifting mortar shells.

Data-driven approach to prevention

To identify emerging trends and prioritize interventions, the ergonomics team collaborates closely with the DHA-PH’s Injury Prevention Branch, which is part of the Clinical Public Health and Epidemiology directorate, also located at Aberdeen Proving Ground, said Chervak. The Injury Prevention Branch tracks injury trends and uses the Force Risk Reduction management and analysis tool [https://joint.safety.army.mil/] which is managed by the U.S. Army Combat Readiness Center [https://safety.army.mil/] at Fort Rucker, Alabama, to recognize patterns and emerging issues across military installations.

FR2 is available to individuals in the SOH community and human resources community with a government-issued CAC and a .mil email address.

Accessing ergonomic support

Multiple pathways of assistance are available for service members experiencing ergonomic concerns. The primary recommendation is to contact local safety officers, industrial hygienists, or occupational health specialists, who serve as the first line of defense for addressing ergonomic issues, said Chervak.

""If your local team cannot resolve the issue internally or needs additional expertise, they will escalate the matter to our specialized team for advanced assessment and solutions,"" said Chervak. “You can also contact us directly if you prefer or if the situation requires immediate attention. We'll work collaboratively with you and your local SOH team.”

The ergonomics program also develops strategic partnerships with installation SOH personnel. In some cases, an ergonomics team member will virtually attend regularly scheduled SOH meetings, said Lauren Costanzi, DHA-PH ergonomist.

One example of the benefits of this type of collaboration is an effort related to the assembly of a fabric military battery pouch. The SOH office had identified the task as being physically difficult to perform and causing hand and wrist injuries, said Costanzi. The pouch is sewn inside out, which requires it to be flipped right side out prior to shipment. This task requires high-hand forces due to the inflexibility of the stiff fabric. DHA-PH ergonomists measured the forces required to manipulate the battery pouch by using a force gauge to push the corners of the pouch into position. The gauge recorded the peak push force as 42 pounds.

“Ergonomists investigated the use of a home-grade steamer to soften the battery pouch fabric,” said Costanzi. “Softening the fabric reduced the push/pull forces required to manipulate the fabric from inside out to right-side out. Subsequent manipulation of the pouch to turn it right side out resulted in maximum pulling force of 10 pounds, which represents a 67% decrease in the amount of force needed to manipulate the battery pouch.”

Strategic partnerships and standards development

Beyond direct service delivery, the DHA-PH ergonomics program maintains strategic partnerships with professional organizations and standards committees to influence policies affecting military operations, said Chervak. The team actively collaborates with the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs Veterans Health Agency Safe Patient Handling and Mobility and ergonomics programs [https://www.publichealth.va.gov/employeehealth/patient-handling/], the Maryland National Guard, and participates in safe patient handling organizations, human vibration exposure technical advisory groups, and exoskeleton standards committees.

“These partnerships ensure the military can shape standards rather than simply comply with them, preventing increased procurement costs while protecting service member health through proactive engagement in policy development,” said Chervak.

The program also provides digital support to U.S. Army and Department of Defense end users through educational materials, fact sheets, policy guidance, professional publications, and regular updates to military ergonomics guidance documents.

Now, doctors and medical leaders across the Military Health System have a newly released, comprehensive, standardized, evidence-based playbook to help them recognize and manage ER in service members.
Although the guideline was created with warfighters in mind, it also has broad applications in the civilian world.
The new Clinical Practice Guideline gives medical teams: Clear diagnostic standards to help doctors recognize ER earlier and more accurately.
“At the Army Heat Center, we frequently see cases of exertional rhabdomyolysis, either secondary to heat illness or on its own.","SEPTEMBER 17, 2025 – When muscles work too hard, they can actually begin to break down — a dangerous condition known as exertional rhabdomyolysis, or ER. Left untreated, ER can quickly lead to kidney damage, chemical imbalances in the body or even life-threatening complications.

Now, doctors and medical leaders across the Military Health System have a newly released, comprehensive, standardized, evidence-based playbook to help them recognize and manage ER in service members. The Clinical Practice Guideline for the Management of Exertional Rhabdomyolysis was developed by the Uniformed Services University, in collaboration with the Army Heat Center and other Department of War partners through the Warrior Heat- and Exertion-Related Events Collaborative based at USU’s Consortium for Health and Military Performance.

“We are very pleased to release this 2025 Rhabdomyolysis CPG update, which presents multiple significant changes and additions from our 2020 product,” said Dr. Francis O’Connor, professor of military and emergency medicine and CHAMP medical director. “Our joint service team of DOW providers, representing hundreds of years of military relevant experience, has worked very hard to share the most current evidence-based information to our military colleagues to optimize the diagnosis and initial management of warfighters impacted by exertional rhabdomyolysis, and importantly, facilitate return to duty decisions.”

ER occurs when strenuous activity, such as intense training, heavy labor or combat conditions, causes muscle fibers to break down and release their contents into the bloodstream. Early warning signs may include extreme muscle pain, weakness or very dark urine. In severe cases, ER can lead to acute kidney injury, requiring hospitalization or even dialysis.

Although the guideline was created with warfighters in mind, it also has broad applications in the civilian world. Athletes, firefighters, first responders and anyone engaged in high-intensity physical activity may face similar risks, making the resource valuable beyond the military.

The new Clinical Practice Guideline gives medical teams:

Clear diagnostic standards to help doctors recognize ER earlier and more accurately.

Risk categories that sort patients into low or high risk based on lab results and clinical signs.

Tools like the McMahon Score, which combines test results and patient information to predict the chance of kidney injury.

Step-by-step flow charts and decision aids that simplify what can be a complex clinical situation.

Patients at high risk — those with extremely elevated muscle enzymes, signs of compartment syndrome, kidney damage or complicating factors like sickle cell trait — require close monitoring in the hospital. Others, especially those at lower risk, may be safely managed outside the hospital through rest, hydration and follow-up care within 24 to 72 hours.

One of the most important parts of the guideline is its framework for return-to-duty decisions. Low-risk patients progress gradually from rest to reconditioning, while higher-risk patients follow a tailored plan developed with input from specialists.

“At the Army Heat Center, we frequently see cases of exertional rhabdomyolysis, either secondary to heat illness or on its own. Unlike exertional heatstroke, prior to the development of this CPG, return-to-duty guidance was lacking,” said Army Lt. Col. [Dr.] David DeGroot, Army Heat Center director. “Now, providers have a resource to help as they work to return the injured warfighter to duty as quickly as possible, but without jeopardizing their health or increasing risk of reoccurrence.”

The guideline is designed for use by primary care, emergency medicine, sports medicine and operational clinicians across the military. Command medical leaders can also use it to help shape policies around training, selection and deployment cycles. Civilian physicians, athletic trainers and occupational health providers may also find it a valuable reference.

By Munson Army Health Center

TRICARE Prime beneficiaries on Fort Leavenworth and surrounding communities who used the referral approval waiver between Jan.1 and June 30 and are still receiving specialty care off post using the waiver need a new referral before Oct. 1.

The referral approval waiver was issued by the Defense Health Agency in January to minimize disruption to care while a new regional contractor, TriWest Healthcare Alliance, transitioned to provide services.

This meant beneficiaries in TRICARE Region West did not need to wait for TriWest to approve referrals issued by their primary care manager before receiving outpatient specialty care off post.

“If you are currently seeing a specialist using that waiver, this is a critical deadline coming up. Referrals issued during the referral approval waiver period end Sept. 30, and you may be subject to out-of-pocket expenses after that time if you haven’t taken action to update your referral,” said Toni McCall, Munson’s chief of Business Operations Division.

Munson transitioned back to TriWest referral processing in early June, so, many referrals were already processed by TriWest and may already be valid past the September 30 deadline associated with the referral approval waiver.

“Because we resumed referral processing early in June, patients should first verify the validity of their current referral before requesting a new one,” said McCall, emphasizing that this expiration only applies to ongoing care received using the referral approval waiver.

CHECK YOUR REFERRAL STATUS FIRST:

The fastest and most efficient way to check your referral's valid dates is by logging into the TriWest Patient Portal at https://tricare.triwest.com/en/beneficiary, where the regional contractor reviews referrals submitted by your PCM for approval and authorization.

If you don't use the portal, you can call TriWest directly at 888-TRIWEST (874-9378) to inquire about the status of your existing referral.

ONLY REQUEST A NEW REFERRAL IF NECESSARY:

If your TriWest portal shows NO authorization for your continued care after September 30, 2025, THEN follow these steps:

The preferred method for requesting a new referral is to send a secure message to your primary care team through the MHS GENESIS Patient Portal secure message function at https://my.mhsgenesis.health.mil/. This allows for efficient communication and record-keeping.

If you do not have access to the MHS GENESIS Patient Portal, you can call the Munson Army Health Center Appointment Line at 913-684-6250 and request that a message be sent to your primary care team.

“We want to make this transition as smooth as possible for our beneficiaries at Fort Leavenworth,” said McCall. “By checking your referral status first, you can avoid unnecessary steps and ensure you receive the care you need without interruption.”",https://media.defense.gov/2025/Sep/16/2003800412/1920/1080/0/250916-O-OT285-6301.JPG,N,0.0,2025-09-17 09:56:07.948024

Subscribe now and take control of your AI investment future!","We came across a bullish thesis on GRAIL, Inc. on Valueinvestorsclub.com by skimmer610. In this article, we will summarize the bulls’ thesis on GRAL. GRAIL, Inc.’s share was trading at $32.42 as of September 3rd.

GRAIL (NASDAQ: GRAL) represents a compelling risk-reward opportunity in early cancer detection through its Galleri blood test, the first commercially viable multi-cancer early detection (MCED) platform. The company, spun out of Illumina in 2016 and recently spun off again in 2024, has $678 million in cash and a $320 million annual burn rate, with a market cap of $1.6 billion and enterprise value of $900 million.

Galleri addresses a massive market, with over 100 million Americans eligible for screening and a global TAM exceeding $150 billion. Priced at $949 per test, the platform demonstrates strong gross margin potential even if prices fall to $500, and near-term revenues are growing rapidly, up 39% YoY in Q4 2024, supported by partnerships with Quest, Tricare, and life insurers.

Galleri leverages cfDNA methylation sequencing and machine learning to detect 50+ cancers, supported by Illumina’s bioinformatics IP and a proprietary 300K-sample biospecimen dataset, creating a defensible data moat. Clinical traction is strong, with 137K tests sold in 2024 and ongoing PATHFINDER-2 and NHS-Galleri trials.

Statistical analysis of combined trial data predicts ~350 early cancers detected from 175K patients, significantly shifting late-stage incidence and supporting FDA approval. Published studies show high specificity (99.5%) and strong sensitivity across multiple cancers, far exceeding competitors.

Key catalysts over the next 12–18 months include final PATHFINDER-2 results, FDA PMA filing, CMS reimbursement clarity, and NHS coverage decisions. Valuation scenarios range from $28/share in a bear case to $310/share in a bull case, with a base case of $145/share reflecting steady payer adoption. While regulatory and reimbursement risks exist, GRAL’s validated technology, first-mover advantage, massive market, and strong trial data suggest asymmetric upside, positioning the stock for significant gains as it approaches its pivotal 2025–2026 inflection window.

Previously we covered a bullish thesis on GRAIL, Inc. (GRAL) by mike-some in April 2025, which highlighted the company’s leadership in multi-cancer early detection, the spin-off from Illumina, promising PATHFINDER trial results, and potential Medicare/NHS reimbursement driving significant sales. The stock has appreciated ~25% since coverage. Skimmer610 shares a similar bullish view but emphasizes detailed financials, trial statistics, and near-term FDA and CMS catalysts.

GRAIL, Inc. is not on our list of the 30 Most Popular Stocks Among Hedge Funds. As per our database, 25 hedge fund portfolios held GRAL at the end of the first quarter which was 28 in the previous quarter. While we acknowledge the risk and potential of GRAL as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter time frame. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than GRAL and that has 10,000% upside potential, check out our report about this cheapest AI stock.

Disclosure: None.

Artificial intelligence is the greatest investment opportunity of our lifetime. The time to invest in groundbreaking AI is now, and this stock is a steal!

AI is eating the world—and the machines behind it are ravenous.

Each ChatGPT query, each model update, each robotic breakthrough consumes massive amounts of energy. In fact, AI is already pushing global power grids to the brink.

Wall Street is pouring hundreds of billions into artificial intelligence—training smarter chatbots, automating industries, and building the digital future. But there’s one urgent question few are asking:

Where will all of that energy come from?

AI is the most electricity-hungry technology ever invented. Each data center powering large language models like ChatGPT consumes as much energy as a small city. And it’s about to get worse.

Even Sam Altman, the founder of OpenAI, issued a stark warning:

“The future of AI depends on an energy breakthrough.”

Elon Musk was even more blunt:

“AI will run out of electricity by next year.”

As the world chases faster, smarter machines, a hidden crisis is emerging behind the scenes. Power grids are strained. Electricity prices are rising. Utilities are scrambling to expand capacity.

And that’s where the real opportunity lies…

One little-known company—almost entirely overlooked by most AI investors—could be the ultimate backdoor play. It’s not a chipmaker. It’s not a cloud platform. But it might be the most important AI stock in the US owns critical energy infrastructure assets positioned to feed the coming AI energy spike.

As demand from AI data centers explodes, this company is gearing up to profit from the most valuable commodity in the digital age: electricity.

The “Toll Booth” Operator of the AI Energy Boom

It owns critical nuclear energy infrastructure assets, positioning it at the heart of America’s next-generation power strategy.

It’s one of the only global companies capable of executing large-scale, complex EPC (engineering, procurement, and construction) projects across oil, gas, renewable fuels, and industrial infrastructure.

It plays a pivotal role in U.S. LNG exportation—a sector about to explode under President Trump’s renewed “America First” energy doctrine.

Trump has made it clear: Europe and U.S. allies must buy American LNG.

And our company sits in the toll booth—collecting fees on every drop exported.

But that’s not all…

As Trump’s proposed tariffs push American manufacturers to bring their operations back home, this company will be first in line to rebuild, retrofit, and reengineer those facilities.

AI. Energy. Tariffs. Onshoring. This One Company Ties It All Together.

While the world is distracted by flashy AI tickers, a few smart investors are quietly scooping up shares of the one company powering it all from behind the scenes.

AI needs energy. Energy needs infrastructure.

And infrastructure needs a builder with experience, scale, and execution.

This company has its finger in every pie—and Wall Street is just starting to notice.

Wall Street is noticing this company also because it is quietly riding all of these tailwinds—without the sky-high valuation.

While most energy and utility firms are buried under mountains of debt and coughing up hefty interest payments just to appease bondholders…

This company is completely debt-free.

In fact, it’s sitting on a war chest of cash—equal to nearly one-third of its entire market cap.

It also owns a huge equity stake in another red-hot AI play, giving investors indirect exposure to multiple AI growth engines without paying a premium.

And here’s what the smart money has started whispering…

The Hedge Fund Secret That’s Starting to Leak Out

This stock is so off-the-radar, so absurdly undervalued, that some of the most secretive hedge fund managers in the world have begun pitching it at closed-door investment summits.

They’re sharing it quietly, away from the cameras, to rooms full of ultra-wealthy clients.

Why? Because excluding cash and investments, this company is trading at less than 7 times earnings.

And that’s for a business tied to:

The AI infrastructure supercycle

The onshoring boom driven by Trump-era tariffs

A surge in U.S. LNG exports

And a unique footprint in nuclear energy—the future of clean, reliable power

You simply won’t find another AI and energy stock this cheap… with this much upside.

This isn’t a hype stock. It’s not riding on hope.

It’s delivering real cash flows, owns critical infrastructure, and holds stakes in other major growth stories.

This is your chance to get in before the rockets take off!

Disruption is the New Name of the Game: Let’s face it, complacency breeds stagnation.

AI is the ultimate disruptor, and it’s shaking the foundations of traditional industries.

The companies that embrace AI will thrive, while the dinosaurs clinging to outdated methods will be left in the dust.

As an investor, you want to be on the side of the winners, and AI is the winning ticket.

The Talent Pool is Overflowing: The world’s brightest minds are flocking to AI.

From computer scientists to mathematicians, the next generation of innovators is pouring its energy into this field.

After the opening plenary session, Pat Flanders, program executive officer - medical systems/chief information officer, and Thomas Hines, chief information security officer, presented the DHA IT awards to CIOs for their assistance in supporting DHA’s strategic objectives.

Flanders established the awards to honor offices or personnel who excel in three categories in support of DHA’s Program Management Office-Medical Systems. “This year’s Military Medical Treatment Facility and Clinic Chief Information Officer Award winners showcase the remarkable talent of our Defense Health Agency IT professionals, and I really appreciate their efforts in helping bolster my strategic priorities,” said Flanders.

Three DHA teams received awards for their work in auditability compliance, cybersecurity, and rationalization/alignment of resources in military hospital and clinics.

Cybersecurity

Air Force Master Sgt. Jonathan Rodriguez-Feliciano, deputy chief information officer at the 374th Medical Group at Yokota Air Base in Japan, accepted the award for cybersecurity. This award is presented to the site that excels in all aspects of cybersecurity, which includes doing the best job managing their authorizations to operate and their overall cyber hygiene.

Our team took a proactive, “all-hands” approach to strengthening our cyber posture, explained Rodriguez-Feliciano. “We partnered with higher headquarters and subject matter experts to execute thousands of security checklist items across every system and clinic. That meant reviewing policies, hardening networks, training staff, and validating compliance line by line. With leadership involvement and full support from our staff, we turned our inspection into an opportunity to elevate how we operate every day.”

Auditability compliance

The audibility compliance award was presented to the site that complies best with monthly reporting requirements as laid out in a DHA procedural instruction on information security compliance. Air Force Tech. Sgt. Ezekiel Gandy accepted the award on behalf of the 8th Medical Group, Kunsan Air Base in South Korea.

The award recognized the medical group’s support of financial auditability as it ensures transparency, accountability, and proper stewardship of taxpayer money, and is in alignment with a key DHA procedural instruction This instruction requires CIOs to certify compliance with the various system reporting, and the Kunsan Air Base team met monthly requirements without fail.

Rationalization / alignment of resources

The Rationalization / Alignment of Resources Award recognizes the chief information office that excelled in submitting monthly reports in Ektropy, a DHA system that helps leader visualize the management of IT resources, personnel, and costs. The award was presented to the Lyster Army Health Clinic at Fort Rucker in Alabama. The award was accepted by Kelly McCreery, deputy chief information officer.

The referral approval waiver was issued by the Defense Health Agency in January to minimize disruption to care while a new regional contractor, TriWest Healthcare Alliance, transitioned to provide services.

This meant beneficiaries in TRICARE Region West did not need to wait for TriWest to approve referrals issued by their primary care manager before receiving outpatient specialty care off post.

“If you are currently seeing a specialist using that waiver, this is a critical deadline coming up. Referrals issued during the referral approval waiver period end Sept. 30, and you may be subject to out-of-pocket expenses after that time if you haven’t taken action to update your referral,” said Toni McCall, Munson’s chief of Business Operations Division.

CHECK YOUR REFERRAL STATUS FIRST:

The fastest and most efficient way to check your referral's valid dates is by logging into the TriWest Patient Portal at https://tricare.triwest.com/en/beneficiary, where the regional contractor reviews referrals submitted by your PCM for approval and authorization.

If you don't use the portal, you can call TriWest directly at 888-TRIWEST (874-9378) to inquire about the status of your existing referral.

ONLY REQUEST A NEW REFERRAL IF NECESSARY:

If your TriWest portal shows NO authorization for your continued care after September 30, 2025, THEN follow these steps:

The preferred method for requesting a new referral is to send a secure message to your primary care team through the MHS GENESIS Patient Portal secure message function at https://my.mhsgenesis.health.mil/. This allows for efficient communication and record-keeping.

If you do not have access to the MHS GENESIS Patient Portal, you can call the Munson Army Health Center Appointment Line at 913-684-6250 and request that a message be sent to your primary care team.

Critical collaboration Ferrara and Orsega underscored that collaboration is imperative to effective governance.","As military medicine embraces artificial intelligence and digital technology, top Department of War health leaders stressed that strong governance is critical to safely drive innovation to adopt these tools that improve patient outcomes and drive increased military readiness.

During the Defense Health Information Technology Symposium in Nashville, Tennessee, in August 2025, Dr. Stephen Ferrara, acting assistant secretary of war for health affairs and Ms. Susan Orsega, deputy assistant secretary of war for health services policy and oversight, provided insight into how governance ensures the Military Health System is digitally enabled, safe, interoperable, and aligned with warfighter mission readiness.

Ferrara underscored governance is what translates technology into real outcomes, saying, “We need to deliver a truly integrated, digitally enabled and globally partnered system of readiness and health care … where a medic in CENTCOM can consult a trauma specialist at Walter Reed in seconds.”

Digital Health AI policies, particularly the use and governance of AI, is an area Dr. Ferrara has asked that Orsega prioritize.

“We've got to be prepared for the ever-changing warfare ecosystem,” Orsega said. “It is imperative to be integrating and to be interoperable in those digital health spaces, so that we have those tools from either the battlefield to the bedside.”

Governance is foundationally essential to keep up with rapidly evolving AI, she said, for “the scale, the challenges, the demand, the clear priorities, and policies to focus ourselves strategically, enhancing the operational efficiencies … and looking at the readiness of the force.”

The MHS has established guardrails to ensure the use of AI and other advanced tools are implemented responsibly through the MHS Digital Policy Council, launched in March 2025. In her recent appointment as the chair, Orsega cited the policy as assurance that technology, data, and AI efforts are aligned and governed across the MHS “by streamlining digital priorities, reducing redundancies, and focusing on health data as a readiness tool.”

“The digital policy council is intended to ensure that we take a look at, not pull down, the redundancies,” she said. “At the same time, we want to ensure that we have horizontal synergy across all the services.”

Orsega provided an example of a large organization’s diagnostic oncology AI tool as an essential lesson learned in the need for oversight. The AI system once promised to revolutionize cancer care, but it often produced unsafe or irrelevant recommendations. “The clinicians could not rely on that piece of the AI tool to make clear decisions,” she said.

The failure, she said, was not the technology itself but the absence of efficient oversight, as the tool needed stronger governance, infrastructure, and the ability to be audited to ensure better outcomes and reliability.

By contrast, she pointed to the Cleveland Clinic’s Digital Health Playbook as a guide that provides clearly defined roles, responsibilities, and processes for using digital tools. The playbook provided guidance, “that carves out and identifies everyone's role … in everything from telehealth procedures to how to access digital platforms,” she said, adding that it “provides a good example for us as we look at harnessing AI.”

Safe adoption bolsters readiness

For Ferrara, digital health and governance is inseparable from readiness.

“We’re focused on a mission that cuts across so many sectors — delivering smarter, integrated, data-driven health care for service members and their families,” said Ferrara. “It’s more than a technical conversation; it’s an operational imperative.”

He highlighted the full deployment of MHS GENESIS, the electronic health record that provides a single health record for service members, veterans, and family members, as a digital foundation to readiness.

“This is the backbone of a connected system that allows service members’ medical records to follow them from basic training to the battlefield, and ultimately home, and soon to the VA in one smooth, uninterrupted flow,” Ferrara explained.

With MHS GENESIS in place, Ferrara said the MHS is investing in AI-powered support for PTSD, suicide risk, and traumatic brain injury. He also emphasized that oversight is critical: “It’s not merely about adopting new technologies, but how we strategically integrate them into our workflows to improve patient outcomes and ultimately bolster the readiness of our fighting force,” he said.

Building the guardrails

The MHS Digital Policy Council brings together senior leaders across the services to evaluate emerging technologies, prevent duplication, and direct investments where they are most effective. Since its inception, the council has identified and started reviewing more than 100 AI projects across the MHS.

Orsega outlined four areas where the council provided this much-needed governance stability:

Policy and process: Tie AI tools to accountability

Inclusive expertise: Support of clinicians, scientists, and technologists in the room together

Audit platforms, data integrity, and infrastructure: Foundation for safe use

Training: Certify health care professionals can use AI tools responsibly.

Critical collaboration

Ferrara and Orsega underscored that collaboration is imperative to effective governance.

“None of this work can succeed in silos,” Ferrara said. “Our public-private partnerships are essential, not just for developing new tools, but for testing, scaling, and governing them responsibly.”

Orsega added that governance extends beyond the Department of War. NATO’s Committee of Chiefs of Military Medical Services, she noted, is already examining digital transformation, biotech, and decision-support systems in multi-domain operations. Collaboration with the Department of Veterans Affairs and other federal agencies is equally critical.

She stressed the importance of preparing “for that ever-changing ecosystem, either homeland or abroad, and it's our battle cry to ensure that we have those right tools, so that we have the right policies and processes and standards in place,” noting that if there is an urgent need to use digital tools, “we feel really comfortable and confident that our tools are reliable and that they're laser precise for that decision in that moment.”

Orsega concluded by encouraging attendees of DHITS — comprised of government, military, and industry health care information technology professionals — “to be a part of the solution.”

“We have a unique opportunity to confront the challenges that lie ahead and to take that bold initiative.”

How to check whether your TRICARE plan covers Ozempic You can visit the Novo Nordisk NovoCare site to see if your TRICARE plan covers Ozempic.","Ozempic is a brand-name prescription drug that the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has approved for Type 2 diabetes, cardiovascular risk reduction, and kidney disease in adults. Healthcare providers may also prescribe Ozempic off-label (a non-FDA-approved use) for weight loss and long-term weight management. Ozempic is part of a group of drugs called glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists (GLP-1s) and contains the active ingredient semaglutide. If you are prescribed this once-weekly injectable medicine, you may want to know whether your TRICARE plan provides coverage, since Ozempic can be expensive without insurance or prescription discounts.

Does TRICARE cover Ozempic?

Many TRICARE plans provide coverage of Ozempic for Type 2 diabetes, although coverage varies by plan.

In order for TRICARE to cover Ozempic, you’ll need to meet the clinical criteria for Type 2 diabetes and have your healthcare provider submit a prior authorization form. As of Aug. 31, 2025, your healthcare provider will also have to submit proof of medical necessity, but only if you choose to have your Ozempic prescription filled at a military pharmacy and pay the lower formulary copay. If you fill your prescription at a retail or mail-order pharmacy, a prior authorization should suffice. This coverage also applies to similar drugs like Mounjaro, Victoza, and Trulicity.

Currently, TRICARE covers Ozempic for Type 2 diabetes, but not for weight loss. If you have TRICARE and want coverage for weight loss medication, you may want to consider Wegovy (semaglutide), Zepbound (tirzepatide), Saxenda (liraglutide), Qsymia (phentermine-topiramate ER), phentermine, or Contrave. TRICARE may cover those medications for weight loss, but only for certain beneficiary groups. Coverage also depends on your condition and certain criteria. Prior authorization and step therapy, which involves trying more affordable options first, are required.

How much is Ozempic without insurance?

If you are paying without insurance, a typical prescription of Ozempic (one 3 mL pen containing 2 mg/3 mL) costs about $1,387. By using a SingleCare card or coupon, you can pay as low as $825 for your Ozempic pen—a savings of $562 each time you fill your prescription.

How much does Ozempic cost with TRICARE?

There are several options in terms of pharmacies where you can fill your Ozempic prescription with TRICARE, and your cost may vary by pharmacy:

Military Treatment Facility (MTF) pharmacy: This is the primary pharmacy option for active duty service members. Prescriptions are typically filled at no cost ($0) at an MTF, but coverage rules still apply—Ozempic is considered non-formulary and requires both prior authorization and a medical necessity form. Non-active duty beneficiaries may also use MTF pharmacies and may pay a reduced copay.

TRICARE Home Delivery (mail order): Up to a 90-day supply is available for $76 for non-active duty beneficiaries, with prior authorization required.

Retail pharmacies in the TRICARE network: A 30-day supply is typically $76 for non-active duty beneficiaries, with prior authorization required.

Because coverage and out-of-pocket costs can vary depending on your status, the pharmacy you use to fill your prescription, and any policy updates, it’s always best to check your exact cost and coverage through the TRICARE Formulary Search Tool or by calling member services.

How to check whether your TRICARE plan covers Ozempic

You can visit the Novo Nordisk NovoCare site to see if your TRICARE plan covers Ozempic. Select government insurance, which includes TRICARE, and enter the required information to find out more about your benefits on your specific TRICARE health plan.

You can also check the TRICARE Formulary Search feature. On this website, you will enter the drug Ozempic, select the prescribed dose, and enter your biological gender and age. The results will show different options based on your pharmacy (military pharmacy, mail order pharmacy, or retail pharmacy) and whether you are active duty or not active duty. Ozempic typically requires a prior authorization under TRICARE, which means your healthcare provider will have to submit information to your plan as to why this medicine is medically necessary, and then the plan will make a coverage decision.

You can also call your TRICARE representative directly to find out more about Ozempic cost and coverage. Another way to find out about Ozempic coverage on your TRICARE plan is to have your healthcare provider send the prescription to your preferred pharmacy. The pharmacy staff will process the prescription and may be able to initiate the prior authorization process.

How to save on Ozempic

One of the best ways to save money on Ozempic is by using a SingleCare coupon. It’s free to use, and you can use the discount every month to save hundreds of dollars on your prescription. SingleCare is accepted at over 35,000 pharmacies in the U.S. and Puerto Rico.

There are also other ways to save on Ozempic. The manufacturer’s website lists various savings options. However, these options have eligibility criteria and are typically only for people with commercial health insurance (or who are uninsured)—people with government insurance plans such as TRICARE do not qualify for these offers. You can also check prices at various pharmacies to see who has the best prices—what’s more, some pharmacies may offer a discount if you purchase a larger quantity up front (such as a three-month supply). It’s also a good idea to ask your pharmacist or healthcare provider if they know of any local resources in your community that can help pay for the cost of your medicines.",https://www.singlecare.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/does-tricare-cover-ozempic.png,N,0.0,2025-09-16 18:56:07.395658

Cybersecurity

Air Force Master Sgt. Jonathan Rodriguez-Feliciano, deputy chief information officer at the 374th Medical Group at Yokota Air Base in Japan, accepted the award for cybersecurity. This award is presented to the site that excels in all aspects of cybersecurity, which includes doing the best job managing their authorizations to operate and their overall cyber hygiene.

Our team took a proactive, “all-hands” approach to strengthening our cyber posture, explained Rodriguez-Feliciano. “We partnered with higher headquarters and subject matter experts to execute thousands of security checklist items across every system and clinic. That meant reviewing policies, hardening networks, training staff, and validating compliance line by line. With leadership involvement and full support from our staff, we turned our inspection into an opportunity to elevate how we operate every day.”

Auditability compliance

The audibility compliance award was presented to the site that complies best with monthly reporting requirements as laid out in a DHA procedural instruction on information security compliance. Air Force Tech. Sgt. Ezekiel Gandy accepted the award on behalf of the 8th Medical Group, Kunsan Air Base in South Korea.

The award recognized the medical group’s support of financial auditability as it ensures transparency, accountability, and proper stewardship of taxpayer money, and is in alignment with a key DHA procedural instruction This instruction requires CIOs to certify compliance with the various system reporting, and the Kunsan Air Base team met monthly requirements without fail.

Despite their vocal objections, Democrats failed to stop six last-minute amendments aimed at restricting the rights of transgender individuals in the U.S. military, all of which passed via voice vote. Seventeen Democrats ultimately sided with Republicans in voting for the amended bill.

Sweeping Anti-Trans Provisions Approved

The controversial amendments included:

Two bans on medically necessary gender-affirming healthcare — including mental health services — for transgender service members and their families.

A ban on transgender women participating in sports at military academies.

A prohibition on the Department of Defence collecting gender identity data, requiring surveys to refer only to sex assigned at birth.

Restrictions preventing trans individuals from using gender-aligned facilities on military installations.

A ban on Pride flag displays at any U.S. military facility.

Four of the six amendments were introduced by Representative Nancy Mace (R-SC), a staunch anti-trans advocate and current gubernatorial candidate.

House Floor Clashes Over Pride Flag and Healthcare

Representative Maxine Dexter (D-OR) attempted to defend the right to display the Pride flag, challenging the reversal of a previous NDAA compromise that gave base commanders discretion on such displays. She called the amendment “cruel and callous” and placed a small Pride flag on the podium as she spoke.

Her gesture sparked immediate backlash from Republican members. A Florida representative objected, backed by Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene (R-GA), who demanded the flag be removed.

“That flag violates our House rules,” said the presiding officer.

“I am not waving it, Mr. Speaker,” Dexter replied, continuing her statement. “This obsession with attacking, dehumanising, and villainising our LGBTQIA community is as sick as it is a waste of time. Trump is using the same tired playbook authoritarian regimes have used throughout history.”

Heated Exchanges Over Gender-Affirming Care

Rep. Sara Jacobs (D-CA) also took the floor to oppose Mace’s amendment banning TRICARE coverage for gender-affirming procedures. When Jacobs highlighted procedures such as breast augmentation and filler treatments as medically recognised forms of gender-affirming care, Mace shouted across the chamber, “You are absolutely ridiculous! What the hell is your problem?”

Mace later escalated the exchange on social media, implying Jacobs, who is Jewish, needed a “nose job,” a comment widely condemned as antisemitic.

LGBTQ+ Advocates Condemn the Legislation

Congressional Equality Caucus Chair Rep. Mark Takano released a statement after the bill’s passage, condemning Republicans for what he described as injecting “poison-pill riders” into a bill meant to improve the lives of military personnel.

“Republicans’ sacrifice of a strong bipartisan vote for a politicised NDAA to appease the Trump Administration and a small slice of their base cannot undo the sacrifice of the transgender servicemembers, cadets, or military dependents that will be hurt by this bill,” Takano stated. “Congress should be fighting for those who fight for us—but it’s clear the GOP has other priorities.”

Kathleen Cooperman, the new deputy director for Defense Health Network Pacific Rim (DHN-PR), visited the Virtual Medical Operations Center (VMOC) at Naval Medical Center San Diego (NMCSD) Sept. 3 to learn firsthand how the hub is transforming patient care and operational medical support across the Military Health System.

About Defense Health Network Pacific Rim: Defense Health Network Pacific Rim (DHN-PR) is one of the Defense Health Agency’s nine networks of hospitals and clinics that deliver high-quality health care to more than 140,000 enrolled beneficiaries, supporting major operational units through the Indo-Pacific.
The DHN-PR headquarters is located in San Diego, overseeing military hospitals and clinics along the U.S. West Coast and overseas in Guam and Japan.","SAN DIEGO – Capt. Kathleen Cooperman, the new deputy director for Defense Health Network Pacific Rim (DHN-PR), visited the Virtual Medical Operations Center (VMOC) at Naval Medical Center San Diego (NMCSD) Sept. 3 to learn firsthand how the hub is transforming patient care and operational medical support across the Military Health System.

Cooperman, a native of Arlington, Virginia, comes to the network after serving as commanding officer of U.S. Navy Medicine Readiness and Training Command Okinawa and director of U.S. Naval Hospital Okinawa, Japan, from July 2023 to August 2025. A graduate of Virginia Commonwealth University with a master’s degree in health administration, and the Naval Postgraduate School, Monterey, California she has served in Navy Medicine’s Medical Service Corps for more than two decades.

NMCSD is one of nine military treatment facilities in the DHN-PR and during her visit, Cooperman received an overview of the VMOC’s current role, which includes providing real-time inpatient virtual care and tele-critical care support to military hospitals and clinics worldwide. By centralizing monitoring and leveraging specialized providers virtually, the VMOC extends critical care expertise to military treatment facilities and operational forces around the globe, improving readiness while delivering safe, high-quality patient care.

“As I learn about DHN Pacific Rim’s operations and capabilities, visits like this are so important,” Cooperman said. “My role is to listen, learn, and help connect the dots so we can integrate and scale capabilities like the VMOC into robust resources with global reach to provide health care expertise and strengthen collaboration across the Military Health System.”

Brian Howard, assistant director for support operations at DHN Pacific Rim, organized the visit to familiarize Cooperman with the VMOC’s role in supporting both military medical treatment facilities and operational missions.

“This center has grown from an idea several years ago into a capability that today supports more than two dozen MTFs,” said Howard. “It’s not about replacing in-person care, it’s about extending the expertise of medical specialists across the Military Health System to save lives.”

Howard explained that the VMOC model allows intensivists and other specialists to provide real-time guidance from San Diego to teams on the ground, from walking providers in an ICU at an overseas hospital through a difficult case to advising corpsmen and medics in the field.

“This is an extender of our medical force,” he said. “We can’t put a critical care specialist everywhere, but through the VMOC we can connect them to patients and providers who need their knowledge and skills—whether it’s at U.S. Naval Hospital Guam, Madigan Army Medical Center, or a corpsman managing a traumatic injury downrange.”

Looking ahead, the VMOC is exploring opportunities to expand services such as EEG monitoring, ad-hoc dialysis, and advanced consultative support, while piloting new approaches to integrate digital health and readiness tools.

“The VMOC is impressive,” said Cooperman. “And to really maximize its potential, to take it to the next level, we need to define and codify the program requirements and organizationally align capabilities as a portfolio of assets to ensure we optimize the MHS as a system. Looking to the future and how we care for the warfighter during the next global conflict to save lives and keep them in the fight, this is the time to invest in resources like the VMOC and drive the readiness portion of the Defense Health Agency’s responsibility to the Indo-Pacific.”

Cooperman’s visit underscored DHA’s commitment to modernizing health care delivery, advancing digital health transformation, and ensuring medically ready forces. The VMOC, aligned with the DHA’s strategic priorities and the Military Health System’s Ready Reliable Care framework, represents one way the MHS is leveraging technology and innovation to deliver on its mission of caring for the joint force and their families—anytime, anywhere, always.

The playbook provided guidance, “that carves out and identifies everyone's role … in everything from telehealth procedures to how to access digital platforms,” she said, adding that it “provides a good example for us as we look at harnessing AI.” Safe adoption bolsters readiness For Ferrara, digital health and governance is inseparable from readiness.
Building the guardrails The MHS Digital Policy Council brings together senior leaders across the services to evaluate emerging technologies, prevent duplication, and direct investments where they are most effective.
Since its inception, the council has identified and started reviewing more than 100 AI projects across the MHS.
Critical collaboration Ferrara and Orsega underscored that collaboration is imperative to effective governance.","As military medicine embraces artificial intelligence and digital technology, top Department of War health leaders stressed that strong governance is critical to safely drive innovation to adopt these tools that improve patient outcomes and drive increased military readiness.

During the Defense Health Information Technology Symposium in Nashville, Tennessee, in August 2025, Dr. Stephen Ferrara, acting assistant secretary of war for health affairs and Ms. Susan Orsega, deputy assistant secretary of war for health services policy and oversight, provided insight into how governance ensures the Military Health System is digitally enabled, safe, interoperable, and aligned with warfighter mission readiness.

Ferrara underscored governance is what translates technology into real outcomes, saying, “We need to deliver a truly integrated, digitally enabled and globally partnered system of readiness and health care … where a medic in CENTCOM can consult a trauma specialist at Walter Reed in seconds.”

Digital Health AI policies, particularly the use and governance of AI, is an area Dr. Ferrara has asked that Orsega prioritize.

“We've got to be prepared for the ever-changing warfare ecosystem,” Orsega said. “It is imperative to be integrating and to be interoperable in those digital health spaces, so that we have those tools from either the battlefield to the bedside.”

Governance is foundationally essential to keep up with rapidly evolving AI, she said, for “the scale, the challenges, the demand, the clear priorities, and policies to focus ourselves strategically, enhancing the operational efficiencies … and looking at the readiness of the force.”

The MHS has established guardrails to ensure the use of AI and other advanced tools are implemented responsibly through the MHS Digital Policy Council, launched in March 2025. In her recent appointment as the chair, Orsega cited the policy as assurance that technology, data, and AI efforts are aligned and governed across the MHS “by streamlining digital priorities, reducing redundancies, and focusing on health data as a readiness tool.”

“The digital policy council is intended to ensure that we take a look at, not pull down, the redundancies,” she said. “At the same time, we want to ensure that we have horizontal synergy across all the services.”

Orsega provided an example of a large organization’s diagnostic oncology AI tool as an essential lesson learned in the need for oversight. The AI system once promised to revolutionize cancer care, but it often produced unsafe or irrelevant recommendations. “The clinicians could not rely on that piece of the AI tool to make clear decisions,” she said.

The failure, she said, was not the technology itself but the absence of efficient oversight, as the tool needed stronger governance, infrastructure, and the ability to be audited to ensure better outcomes and reliability.

By contrast, she pointed to the Cleveland Clinic’s Digital Health Playbook as a guide that provides clearly defined roles, responsibilities, and processes for using digital tools. The playbook provided guidance, “that carves out and identifies everyone's role … in everything from telehealth procedures to how to access digital platforms,” she said, adding that it “provides a good example for us as we look at harnessing AI.”

Safe adoption bolsters readiness

For Ferrara, digital health and governance is inseparable from readiness.

“We’re focused on a mission that cuts across so many sectors — delivering smarter, integrated, data-driven health care for service members and their families,” said Ferrara. “It’s more than a technical conversation; it’s an operational imperative.”

He highlighted the full deployment of MHS GENESIS, the electronic health record that provides a single health record for service members, veterans, and family members, as a digital foundation to readiness.

“This is the backbone of a connected system that allows service members’ medical records to follow them from basic training to the battlefield, and ultimately home, and soon to the VA in one smooth, uninterrupted flow,” Ferrara explained.

With MHS GENESIS in place, Ferrara said the MHS is investing in AI-powered support for PTSD, suicide risk, and traumatic brain injury. He also emphasized that oversight is critical: “It’s not merely about adopting new technologies, but how we strategically integrate them into our workflows to improve patient outcomes and ultimately bolster the readiness of our fighting force,” he said.

Building the guardrails

The MHS Digital Policy Council brings together senior leaders across the services to evaluate emerging technologies, prevent duplication, and direct investments where they are most effective. Since its inception, the council has identified and started reviewing more than 100 AI projects across the MHS.

Orsega outlined four areas where the council provided this much-needed governance stability:

• Policy and process: Tie AI tools to accountability

• Inclusive expertise: Support of clinicians, scientists, and technologists in the room together

• Audit platforms, data integrity, and infrastructure: Foundation for safe use

• Training: Certify health care professionals can use AI tools responsibly.

Critical collaboration

Ferrara and Orsega underscored that collaboration is imperative to effective governance.

“None of this work can succeed in silos,” Ferrara said. “Our public-private partnerships are essential, not just for developing new tools, but for testing, scaling, and governing them responsibly.”

Orsega added that governance extends beyond the Department of War. NATO’s Committee of Chiefs of Military Medical Services, she noted, is already examining digital transformation, biotech, and decision-support systems in multi-domain operations. Collaboration with the Department of Veterans Affairs and other federal agencies is equally critical.

She stressed the importance of preparing “for that ever-changing ecosystem, either homeland or abroad, and it's our battle cry to ensure that we have those right tools, so that we have the right policies and processes and standards in place,” noting that if there is an urgent need to use digital tools, “we feel really comfortable and confident that our tools are reliable and that they're laser precise for that decision in that moment.”

Orsega concluded by encouraging attendees of DHITS — comprised of government, military, and industry health care information technology professionals — “to be a part of the solution.”

“We have a unique opportunity to confront the challenges that lie ahead and to take that bold initiative.”",https://d1ldvf68ux039x.cloudfront.net/thumbs/photos/2509/9290504/1000w_q95.jpg,N,0.0,2025-09-15 17:56:08.019100
