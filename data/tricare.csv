Prevent Bigger Problems with Early, Conservative Care | New York Dental Clinic | Daegu Dental Clinic

Cavities may seem small, but if left untreated, they can rapidly progress—damaging deeper tooth layers, causing pain, and eventually requiring root canal therapy or even extraction. At New York Dental Clinic, a leading Daegu dental clinic, we specialize in early-stage cavity detection and minimally invasive treatment that preserves your natural tooth and protects your long-term oral health.

Whether it’s your first cavity or a recurring issue under an old filling, we use advanced diagnostic tools and aesthetic materials to restore your smile quickly, safely, and painlessly.

🦠 What Is a Cavity?

A cavity (or dental caries) is the result of tooth enamel breakdown caused by acid-producing bacteria. This acid forms when sugars and carbohydrates combine with plaque on the tooth surface. If not addressed, it can eat through the enamel, spread into the dentin, and eventually reach the nerve, causing infection, pain, and tooth loss.

✅ Signs You May Have a Cavity:

Sensitivity to hot, cold, or sweets

A visible hole or dark spot on the tooth

Pain when chewing or biting down

Bad breath or an unpleasant taste

Roughness or food getting stuck in certain areas

Even if you don’t feel pain, cavities can silently progress. That’s why regular checkups at New York Dental are critical for early detection.

🛠️ Our Cavity Treatment Options

At our Daegu dental clinic, we offer a range of filling materials to suit every need—whether it's cosmetic, functional, or budget-conscious:

1. Resin (Tooth-Colored Fillings)

Aesthetic and natural-looking

Requires minimal enamel removal

Ideal for front teeth and visible areas

2. Gold Fillings

Extremely durable—can last 20+ years

Excellent for molars and heavy chewers

Biocompatible and wear-resistant

3. Amalgam (Silver Fillings)

Long-lasting and cost-effective

Fast to apply and ideal for posterior teeth

Not suitable for patients with metal allergies or cosmetic concerns

4. Ceramic / CEREC Fillings

Made of high-strength porcelain

Custom-designed with CAD/CAM technology

Best for patients who want a seamless, stain-resistant restoration

We also provide inlays and onlays for larger cavities where standard fillings may not offer enough structural support.

💡 Why Treat Cavities Early?

✔️ Prevent Root Canal or Extraction

Catching decay early avoids nerve damage and saves your natural tooth.

✔️ Stop Spread to Adjacent Teeth

Cavities can affect neighboring teeth if bacteria aren't removed.

✔️ Restore Function and Appearance

A healthy, smooth tooth surface helps with chewing, speech, and aesthetics.

✔️ Quick and Comfortable

Small cavities can often be treated in less than 30 minutes, with little or no discomfort.

🧾 Cost of Cavity Treatment in Daegu

Cavity treatment pricing depends on location, size, and material used:

Resin Fillings: ₩100,000–₩300,000

Gold Fillings: ₩500,000–₩1,000,000 (subject to gold pricing)

Amalgam Fillings: ₩80,000–₩150,000

Dr. Stephen Ferrara, the acting assistant secretary of defense for health affairs, engaged with installation leaders and Defense Health Agency officials to discuss modernization initiatives and the base’s evolving role within the MHS. Leaders highlighted Travis AFB's strategic role as a readiness hub and a vital link in the Department of Defense’s integrated medical and logistics network.

While visiting David Grant USAF Medical Center, military health leaders showcased the team’s contributions to military medicine. DGMC prepares warfighters, sustains medical proficiency, and enhances medical force readiness through innovation and partnerships. Its mission includes trauma training, global aeromedical evacuation, contingency response, and integrated Veterans Affairs/DHA healthcare delivery models.

“David Grant is not just a hospital -- it’s a critical piece of the readiness and logistics infrastructure that connects the medical mission to global mobility operations,” said Col Patrick Parsons, 60th Medical Group commander and DGMC’s director. “What happens here directly supports the warfighter anywhere in the world.”

DGMC leaders emphasized the importance of joint training initiatives, which include training medics, nurses and trauma teams alongside civilian partners, recognizing this integrated approach will be essential in future conflicts, while also enhancing vital medical skills for high-quality patient care at home.

They also showcased ongoing efforts to bolster workforce resilience through clinical training, expanded readiness rotations, and robust academic affiliations. These initiatives aim to ensure the medical force remains adaptable and prepared for emerging challenges.

During a town hall at DGMC and throughout his visit, Ferrara expressed his deep appreciation for the staff's commitment, professionalism, and ongoing impact on military medicine. He also emphasized the vital role Travis AFB plays in developing a resilient and ready medical force, capable of responding globally with speed and efficiency.

“I deeply value these visits because they provide an opportunity to see firsthand the incredible work being done and the unique capabilities that drive our mission forward,” Ferrara said. “Most importantly, I want to thank our medical professionals at Travis for their unwavering dedication to caring for patients, pursuing excellence, and training the next generation of medical professionals who will carry this mission into the future.”

The visit reaffirmed the DOD’s focus on ensuring the MHS remains a cornerstone of military readiness, with Travis AFB and DGMC at the forefront for the delivery of world-class medical care and operational support.",https://d1ldvf68ux039x.cloudfront.net/thumbs/photos/2506/9110749/1000w_q95.jpg,N,1.0,2025-07-18 17:56:18.717191

When someone thinks about what people use their insurance for, they often think about things like broken bones, long-term illnesses, and cardiac events. However, there are other complex conditions a person can use their Tricare insurance to get help for that they may not know about.

Substance use disorders cause physical and psychological damage to people who suffer from them. The disorders can be overcome when a person attends a licensed professional treatment program that treats people who have an addiction to alcohol or drugs. For this reason, Tricare drug and alcohol rehab coverage in California is available to those who need help finding a way to heal from their dependence on substances.

About Tricare Insurance

Tricare is an insurance company that provides comprehensive coverage for military personnel, retirees, and their families. Approximately 9 million

customers use Tricare insurance when visiting physicians, nurses, physician’s assistants, clinics, hospitals, and behavioral healthcare clinicians. Tricare offers health plans, special programs, prescriptions, and dental plans, and most of their plans meet the requirements for coverage provided under the Affordable Care Act.

What Types of Rehab Programs in California Does Tricare Cover?

Tricare is in-network with Bright Future, which means several types of rehab programs can be accessed to help people in all stages of recovery enroll in the right treatment plan for their specific needs. Upon acceptance to a program, each person will receive an assessment to determine which level of care is right for them.

Tricare drug and alcohol rehab coverage in California can be used when attending the following types of programs:

Detox:This is the beginning step in treatment for people who have substance use disorders. A detox program usually takes seven to ten days.

Residential:After attending detox, a residential program provides the multi-disciplinary treatment a person needs to continue the work begun during detoxification. Residential programs typically run from 30 to 90 days.

Partial Hospitalization Program (PHP): PHP requires the person to travel to a facility for their treatment sessions and then return home. Appointments take place for several hours per day on weekdays.

Intensive Outpatient Program (IOP):IOP requires attendance for several hours each week, which gives people time to commit to personal and professional obligations.

Does Tricare Cover Detox?

Tricare covers detoxification programs because they provide people with the structured and nurturing care they need as they navigate the first several days of their recovery.

Does Tricare Cover Residential Rehab?

Once a person completes detox, they can use their coverage to enroll in a residential rehab. They will live in a comfortable facility so they can have round-the-clock care that helps them manage their withdrawal symptoms.

Does Tricare Cover Outpatient Treatment?

Outpatient treatment includes two levels of care. They both match the individual with life-saving therapy modalities, with the only difference being how many hours per week they attend appointments.

Does Tricare Cover Therapy?

Attending therapy provides people who struggle with substance use disorders with the ability to learn how to identify and disarm their triggers to drink or use drugs.

TRICARE beneficiaries in Hamilton, Hill, Lampasas, Maverick, Sutton, and Uvalde counties are now eligible to receive emergency prescription refills through July 27.

For beneficiaries in Bandera, Bexar, Burnet, Caldwell, Coke, Comal, Concho, Gillespie, Guadalupe, Kendall, Kerr, Kimble, Llano, Mason, McCulloch, Menard, Reeves, San Saba, Tom Green, Travis, and Williamson counties, the date has been extended from July 17 to July 27.

To receive an emergency refill of prescription medications, TRICARE beneficiaries should take their prescription bottle to any TRICARE retail network pharmacy. If the bottle is unavailable or the label is damaged or missing, beneficiaries should contact Express Scripts, Inc., or their retail network pharmacy for assistance.

To find a network pharmacy, beneficiaries may call Express Scripts at 1-877-363-1303, or search the network pharmacy locator.

If possible, visit the pharmacy where the prescription was filled. Prescriptions filled by a retail chain may be filled at another store in that chain. If the clinician who prescribed the medication is available, beneficiaries can ask them to call in a new prescription to any network pharmacy. As a reminder, TRICARE beneficiaries, other than active duty service members, may receive urgent care from any TRICARE-authorized urgent care center or provider and do not need a referral. This allows beneficiaries to seek nonemergency care for illnesses or injuries if their primary care provider is unavailable because of emergencies. Any TRICARE beneficiary who reasonably believes they have an emergency should always call 911 or, go to the nearest emergency room.

Beneficiaries are advised to visit Express Scripts’ Weather Notices page for updates.

The Defense Health Agency provides health services to 9.5 million beneficiaries, including uniformed service members, military retirees, and their families. The DHA operates one of the nation’s largest health plans, the TRICARE Health Plan, and manages a global network of more than 700 military hospitals, clinics, and dental facilities.

I’m adhering to my military branch’s instructions on keeping physically fit and eating nutritiously, but I’m having trouble getting rid of some excess pounds from my last duty station, where I mostly sat at a desk. How can I lose those pounds in a healthy way?

Sincerely,

U.S. Air Force Major G. Luke Gagon

To achieve optimum body weight composition (your fit-to-fat ratio) you’ll need to commit to regular exercise and a nutritious diet. Should these lifestyle changes not result in reaching your fitness goals, you may consider discussing weight-loss treatment options with your healthcare provider, including medications that may be appropriate for your specific medical needs and TRICARE coverage.

That’s the message from Dr. Marc Alaric Franzos, a cardiologist at the Uniformed Services University in Bethesda, Maryland. He emphasizes regular physical activity and a heart-healthy Mediterranean-style diet for maximum physical fitness and overall health.

--

“Lifestyle modification is relatively straightforward. It's exactly what you would expect—move more, eat less, and sleep well,” Franzos said.

Ideally, service members should aim for cardiovascular health that includes “at least 150 minutes, maybe up to 300 minutes of moderate exertion, aerobic activity per week,” said Franzos. “If you're doing vigorous exercise where you're getting up into heart rate zones above 85% [of maximum], you can actually cut it down to 75 to 150 minutes per week, but ultimately that means you're still moving quite a bit, and that's a minimum.”

“Regular, vigorous exercise where you can’t carry on a conversation can be hard to maintain session-to-session, so most of your effort should be in the moderate zones.” Franzos. “It can even include walking if you walk briskly.” This weight-bearing exercise helps “maintain the muscle on the bones, but also the bones themselves,” because you want to “avoid osteoporosis, or thinning out of the bones.”

“Diet can be used for comfort, it can be used for celebration, it can be used for friendship, but it's also important to recognize that it's fuel,” for the warfighter, said Franzos.

The Trouble with Losing Weight is Keeping it Off

Losing excess weight is hard to begin with, but so is keeping it off, Franzos said.

When lifestyle modifications don't achieve desired results, MHS beneficiaries who struggle with weight loss should discuss treatment options with their healthcare providers. Treatment approaches may include medications that are appropriate for their specific medical conditions and covered under their TRICARE benefit. Coverage for weight management medications varies based on medical indication and TRICARE enrollment status.

""Healthcare providers are best positioned to evaluate individual patient needs and determine appropriate treatment options, including newer medications that may be available,"" Franzos noted. ""Traditional weight-loss medicines have typically achieved modest results, with some newer treatments showing improved effectiveness when combined with lifestyle changes.""

‘Trust in Your Military Health System’ and Don’t Go It Alone

Franzos cautioned strongly against service members or other beneficiaries ordering medications via mail or from outside the U.S., especially as alternatives to proper medical supervision or because of concerns about treatment access.

“It's just too easy to order something mail order and end up getting a product that may not even contain any GLP-1ra,” Franzos said, but instead, “it may contain other substances which could be very hazardous to your health.”

“I would tell our service members to have trust in your Military Health System, and make an appointment with your primary care doctor, to discuss options and determine if it’s a good option for you.” Military sports medicine and obesity medicine specialists are also available, he noted.

“We've taken a lot of effort to learn about it and ensure that we can give proper counseling, proper guidance, and monitor for the adverse effects that may come up from these medications,” Franzos said.

“But I guarantee you that the first thing out of your doctor’s mouth is going to be, ‘Let me talk to you about lifestyle modification,’ and they're going to reinforce that, and they're going to want you to prove to them that you've taken genuine efforts on that front for about three to six months.”

--

Thanks to Dr. Franzos for his guidance on how to lose weight safely, be physically fit, and stay heart healthy at the same time.

Major, now is the time to get your weight checked and look for other possible causes of weight gain besides inactivity and unhealthy foods.

For more information, check out these resources, and remember, stay safe out there. We want you and your teammates to stay fit and in fighting shape.

Or, have you just married a uniformed service member? If you’re new to TRICARE, you may have some questions about how to enroll in a plan, get care, and learn more about your coverage. So, what exactly is TRICARE?

“TRICARE is the uniformed health care program for service members, retirees, their family members, and other eligible beneficiaries,” explained Malcolm Jones, a TRICARE subject matter expert at the Defense Health Agency. “It brings together the resources of military hospitals and clinics with a network of civilian health care providers and pharmacies.”

TRICARE covers:

Active duty service members and their family members

National Guard and Reserve members and their family members

Retirees and their family members

Survivors

Certain former spouses

Medal of Honor recipients and their family members

Dependent parents and parents-in-law (In some locations, they may be eligible for TRICARE Plus, a program offered at some military hospitals and clinics.)

Foreign force members and their family members

Are you in one of these groups? Keep reading to learn more about the basics of using your TRICARE benefit.

Eligibility

Your uniformed service personnel office determines your TRICARE eligibility.

To check your eligibility, first make sure your information is fully updated in the Defense Enrollment Eligibility Reporting System. Sponsors are automatically registered in DEERS, but they must register their eligible family members by going to a local ID card office. (Note: You should call first, or set up an appointment online, to check appointment availability.)

Then, log in to milConnect to check if you’re eligible for TRICARE. Once you’ve registered on the milConnect website, you can update your contact information in DEERS and view your TRICARE enrollment information.

Health plans

Choosing a plan

You have different TRICARE health plan options depending on your sponsor’s status, your relationship to your sponsor, your age, and where you live.

To see which plans you may be eligible for, check out the Plan Finder Tool and answer a few simple questions. Then, you can use the Compare Plans Tool to figure out which plan is right for you. (Note: Families can have split enrollment, meaning some family members can enroll in one plan, while others enroll in a different one.)

Enrolling in a plan

Once you know your plan, visit TRICARE Enrollment for steps on how to enroll or purchase a plan. These steps may differ depending on the plan you choose and where you live.

Are you a new active duty family member? Once you’re registered in DEERS, you’ll be automatically enrolled in a TRICARE plan based on where you live and the plan selection of your other family members who aren’t active duty service members. You have 90 days from the automatic enrollment date to change to a different plan (TRICARE Prime, TRICARE Select, TRICARE Prime Remote, or the US Family Health Plan, if available).

Changing plans

Interested in switching your TRICARE plan? You may have the opportunity to do so during the annual TRICARE Open Season in the fall each year. Changes you make during open season will take effect Jan. 1 of the following year.

You may also be able to change your plan when you experience a TRICARE Qualifying Life Event. QLEs are certain life changes that open a 90-day window for you and your family members to make eligible enrollment changes, as described in the TRICARE Qualifying Life Events Fact Sheet.

Common QLEs include, but aren’t limited to:

Marriage, divorce, or annulment

Birth or adoption of a child (or placement of a child by a court in a member’s home)

Moving

Activation or deactivation

Retirement or separation

Losing or gaining other health insurance

If you experience a QLE, make sure to update DEERS right away.

Getting care

Regions

TRICARE is available worldwide, and your benefits are the same no matter where you live. But different regional contractors help deliver the benefit around the world. If you get civilian health care, this means you’ll reach out to different customer service contacts depending on where you live.

There are two TRICARE regions in the U.S.:

East Region

West Region

And there is one Overseas Region.

To learn which region you’re in, visit Regions.

Military hospitals and clinics

The DHA operates military hospitals and clinics. You may be able to seek care there, depending on where you are, what plan you have, and your beneficiary group.

Civilian network

You can also seek care from a civilian network of TRICARE-authorized providers. This network depends on your region.

To search for a network provider, use the Find a Doctor Tool to get you to the right provider directory.

Note: You may be able to see a non-network TRICARE-authorized provider, depending on your TRICARE plan. But you may have higher out-of-pocket costs, and you may have to file your own claims.

ID cards

For most beneficiaries, you’ll need to show your Uniformed Services ID card to your provider as proof of TRICARE coverage. If you’re an active duty service member, you’ll need to show your Common Access Card.

Coverage

TRICARE covers treatments, procedures, prescription drugs, or devices that are medically necessary and considered proven. Learn more about how a service becomes a TRICARE-covered benefit.

You can use the Covered Services Tool to see if a service is covered by TRICARE or not. You can search by keyword or browse common categories.

Pharmacy, dental, and vision coverage

TRICARE offers prescription drug coverage and several options for filling your prescriptions. You have the same prescription coverage with almost any TRICARE health plan. (Note: If you’re enrolled in USFHP, you have separate pharmacy coverage.)

To check if your prescription drugs are covered, use the TRICARE Formulary Search Tool.

Dental coverage is separate from TRICARE’s medical coverage. Depending on your beneficiary group, you may get dental care through:

Military dental clinics

Active Duty Dental Program

TRICARE Dental Program

Federal Employees Dental and Vision Insurance Program

Vision coverage, including eye exams, depends on:

Who you are

Your TRICARE plan

Your age

Costs

Each TRICARE plan has different costs for care and coverage. See TRICARE Costs to view and compare costs for covered services, enrollment fees, and plan premiums.

Who Is the Health Insurance Provider, TRICARE?

TRICARE is the health insurance program operated by the U.S. Department of Defense as part of its Military Health System. The official brand dates to the mid-1990s. However, its origins can be traced to the 1966 establishment of CHAMPUS (Civilian Health and Medical Program of the Uniformed Services), as the government expanded care to military retirees and dependents.

Launched in its current form between 1995 and 1997, TRICARE offers a comprehensive suite of health plans to diverse groups, including active-duty service members, military families, retirees, National Guard/Reserve members, young adults, and Medal of Honor recipients. Key plans include TRICARE Prime (HMO‑style), TRICARE Select (PPO style), TRICARE for Life (Medicare wrap‑around), Reserve Select/Retired plans, and Young Adult coverage. Specialty services can include pharmacy, mental health, dental, ECHO for dependents with special needs, and overseas care, demonstrating a role as the civilian-care arm of military healthcare.

What Is TRICARE Health’s Online Treatment Coverage?

TRICARE online mental health coverage in Texas is provided through its telemedicine benefit, offering real-time Video conferencing therapy and audio-only care. Your online treatment sessions for counseling, medication management, or urgent behavioral support are eligible for reimbursement when delivered by TRICARE-authorized providers in your region. Services use secure, HIPAA-compliant platforms that connect you with licensed professionals throughout Texas.

Routine outpatient therapy and more structured programs are typically covered but may require prior authorization before beginning treatment. TRICARE Select and Prime similarly support teletherapy visits and virtual counseling, ensuring continuity of care even when in-person options are limited. This growing modality broadens access, reduces wait times, and maintains quality of care, especially when you live in remote areas of the state or have travel restrictions.

Does TRICARE Insurance Cover Virtual Mental Health Therapy in Texas?

TRICARE does cover virtual mental health in Texas, including counseling, psychiatry, medication management, and crisis support over secure telehealth counseling platforms. Therapy and psychiatric appointments may be delivered through video or audio-only calls, with TRICARE-authorized providers eligible for reimbursement without a separate benefit. You may not need a referral or prior authorization for standard outpatient digital mental health services.

However, it is important to verify your coverage before beginning treatment, so you do not receive a surprise medical bill. Remote psychotherapy sessions use HIPAA-compliant platforms, ensuring confidentiality and quality care. Prior authorization is required if your provider determines virtual intensive programs are medically necessary. You can confidently use your TRICARE benefits for virtual mental health services in Texas, whether for weekly talk therapy or medication support.

Does TRICARE Health Insurance Cover Virtual Dual Diagnosis Therapy for Texas Young Adults?

TRICARE does cover virtual mental health therapy for dual diagnosis in young adults, addressing mental health and substance use disorders in an integrated and coordinated manner. TRICARE’s telehealth benefit includes online individual and group psychotherapy, family counseling, medication management, and crisis support for co‑occurring conditions when delivered by authorized providers over secure video or audio platforms.

Young adults enrolled in TRICARE Prime, Select, or the TRICARE Young Adult program can remotely access this support, provided services are medically necessary. Routine virtual visits may not require prior authorization, though more intensive outpatient care does. This means you can receive online psychiatric help for mental health conditions and substance use disorders without leaving home, ensuring seamless care tailored to your needs, and expanding your path to recovery.

Which Online Treatment Programs Are Covered by TRICARE Insurance in Texas

TRICARE’s telehealth coverage in Texas supports a range of online treatment programs to improve mental well-being through structured therapy, group support, medication management, and crisis intervention. These digital therapy sessions foster consistency, accessibility, and continuity of care to promote recovery. The following examples illustrate the types of programs covered, but it is not a comprehensive list.

Online IOP Covered by TRICARE

Online PHP Covered by TRICARE

Online Outpatient Programs Covered by TRICARE

Online IOP Covered by TRICARE

An online Intensive Outpatient Program (IOP) is a structured, clinically supervised treatment plan when you need more support than weekly therapy but don’t require inpatient care. Virtual IOPs offer multiple sessions per week, using sessions conducted through secure video platforms. This flexible approach allows you to receive comprehensive mental health care while maintaining your daily responsibilities.

TRICARE provides coverage for web-based mental health support that includes IOP services when they are medically necessary and delivered by TRICARE network providers. Depending on your plan, you may be eligible for this level of care that doesn’t require hospitalization. Prior authorization is typically required. When you call BreakThrough by BasePoint, we can confirm your eligibility with your regional contractor and help meet prior authorization requirements before beginning care.

Online PHP Covered by TRICARE

A virtual Partial Hospitalization Program (PHP) is an intensive treatment option when you need daily therapeutic support but do not require hospitalization. PHPs typically involve several hours of care per day, five to six days per week, and include services like psychiatric evaluation, medication management, individual and group therapy, and crisis stabilization delivered remotely through secure internet therapy sessions.

TRICARE covers virtual mental health therapy, including online PHP services, when medically necessary and provided by TRICARE-authorized providers.

How to Get TRICARE Health Insurance to Pay for Online Mental Health Treatment

To get TRICARE to cover your virtual mental health services, confirm your eligibility, understand your plan benefits, and ensure you’re working with a TRICARE-authorized provider. Depending on your plan, you may need a referral or prior authorization, especially for intensive services like IOP or PHP. At BasePoint, we take care of this process for you.

It’s helpful to understand the key insurance terms in your benefits. For example, the underwriting process assesses the company’s risk and liability associated with insuring you. An actuary uses this information to calculate the probability of loss, which determines your premium. A policy may include exclusions to limit your coverage or an umbrella policy to offer wrap-around services, such as in TRICARE for Life, which supplements Medicare. Once a claim is submitted, the information is evaluated by an insurance adjuster to determine the appropriate settlement. Call us today at 972-325-2633, and we’ll handle the paperwork and coordination so you can focus on getting better.

How Many Times Will TRICARE Insurance Pay for Virtual Mental Health Therapy in Texas?

Unlike most private insurance companies, TRICARE does not impose a strict cap on the number of digital therapy sessions you can receive in Texas, as long as the services are medically necessary and delivered by a TRICARE network provider. However, there are some important guidelines. You can receive unlimited sessions when your provider can document medical necessity.

Depending on the level of care, you may need prior authorization before receiving treatment to demonstrate medical necessity and confirm care from an in-network provider. Prior authorization is typically granted in 30- to 90-day blocks of time. This ensures flexibility for your online treatment, which maintains an appropriate level of oversight for ongoing care. We understand that taking the first step towards receiving treatment can feel overwhelming, which is why we handle most of the administrative burden for you, allowing you to focus solely on your treatment.

Data show that online mental wellness can help reduce the stigma attached to mental health, may help those with limited mobility, and is compatible with public health guidelines during highly infectious seasons.

Respondents were more likely to say that mental health telehealth offers the same quality, and younger adults were more likely to use it than older adults.

Online therapy allows you to receive mental health care in the privacy of your home and access providers on a flexible schedule. However, therapy sessions can be impacted by unstable internet connections and may not be comfortable for people who need help with in-person communication skills.

A 2023 review of 24 studies revealed virtual interventions had higher odds of remission and lower posttreatment symptom severity in people who received treatment as usual or were on a waiting list for treatment.

A 2022 study demonstrated that virtual group therapy was equally effective and safe as in-person therapy and had the same attendance level with improved accessibility and acceptability.

Santa Cruz is facing a lawsuit from the American Beverage Association and allied industry groups over its newly enacted soda tax, escalating a legal fight that could have far-reaching implications for local public health policy in California.

Approved by voters in the November 2024 election, Measure Z imposes a 2-cent-per-ounce tax on distributors of sugar-sweetened beverages. Public health advocates have championed this and other similar taxes as a way to reduce consumption of sugary drinks—a leading contributor to diabetes, obesity, heart disease and dental decay.

The lawsuit, filed May 28, 2025, argues that the tax violates the Keep Groceries Affordable Act of 2018, which prohibits California cities and counties from creating new taxes on groceries, including beverages, through January 1, 2031. Included in the act was a penalty that would have stripped a local authority of its sales and use tax revenue should it impose a new grocery–related tax or fee.

However, in 2023, the California Third District Court of Appeals invalidated the financial penalties that once enforced the moratorium, allowing Santa Cruz to move forward with the tax without fear of financial repercussions.

CMA’s long-standing advocacy on sugary beverages

The California Medical Association (CMA) has long supported evidence-based public policies aimed at reducing the health harms associated with sugar-sweetened beverages. Through legislative advocacy and public health partnerships, CMA has backed proposals to impose excise taxes, restrict marketing to children and mandate clear labeling of sugary drinks.

While CMA is not directly involved in the Santa Cruz lawsuit, the association is closely monitoring the case for its potential implications on broader public health policy. CMA policy recognizes the urgent need to reduce consumption of sugary drinks as part of a larger strategy to combat preventable chronic diseases.

“My surgeon recommended me to go to Penrose Cancer Center, which I’ve been working with very closely, now,” Hong said.
He initially received 12 rounds of chemotherapy at the center, but the cancer spread to his liver and stomach.
That took him all the way to the Army Trials, where he earned a spot on Team Army and a trip to the 2025 Warrior Games.
Aside from his U.S. Army teammates, he credits the team at Evans and at Penrose with helping him recover.","As he trains for the 2025 Department of Defense Warrior Games in July, U.S. Army Sgt. 1st Class David Hong attributes his success to “a real team”—though, he’s not talking about his fellow athletes on Team Army.

“I’ve had a team of people that went through my journey, from the platoon sergeants, the squad leaders, my nurse case manager … they’ve participated in my ‘scrimmages,’ my meetings and appointments,” he said.

The team captain: His primary care physician at the time, Paul Haufe, a physician assistant at Evans Army Community Hospital at Fort Carson, Colorado, who encouraged Hong to get a routine colonoscopy at age 50.

“He initiated all of this,” said Hong. “He was always there for me from the get-go, even behind the scenes.”

When Hong received a lifechanging diagnosis, stage 4 colon cancer, his doctor urgently formed a comprehensive care team to start treatment: Specialists, nurses, and other dedicated personnel within the Military Health System.

“They were my coaches, they pushed me,” Hong said.

A cancer diagnosis, a path to recovery

When Hong was due for his first routine colonoscopy in July 2022, his primary care physician “didn’t give me a choice,” he said.

“It was the second time my PCP recommended that I get the screening done. I actually refused to do it because I was busy,” Hong said. “He was going to talk to my command to make sure that I went through with that referral to do the colonoscopy … so I went.”

Besides, he said, he felt fine.

The screening caught a cancerous blockage in his colon, which Hong credits the preventive screening with saving his life.

“These types of cancers, people are getting younger and getting them—they are preventable,” he said. At Hong’s encouragement, twelve chaplains he worked with scheduled their colonoscopies.

He was immediately connected to the gastrointestinal specialist, surgical team, and nurses within Evans.

“It was right at the hospital, and with their capabilities—they were able to have all the resources there to do the cancer removal there the following week,” Hong said.

He had part of his colon removed, but the cancer spread to his lymph nodes. The following month, he started chemotherapy at CommonSpirit Penrose Cancer Center in Colorado Springs through the TRICARE health plan network, which gives access to a wide range of healthcare services by TRICARE-authorized providers—offering streamlined access and reduced costs to nonmilitary hospitals and clinics.

“It was a combination of treatments” through both hospitals, he said, that started his recovery journey.

“My surgeon recommended me to go to Penrose Cancer Center, which I’ve been working with very closely, now,” Hong said. He initially received 12 rounds of chemotherapy at the center, but the cancer spread to his liver and stomach.

Hong went through a total of 23 treatments of chemotherapy and had several surgeries to remove the cancer, as well as part of his liver and stomach lining. He kept up with treatment and appointments through Maria Schuch, the nurse case manager assigned to the Fort Carson Soldier Recovery Unit—a support system that he credits with a proactive approach to his care.

“Right from the beginning, she was really engaged, and she knew what she needed to provide. She was on top of all my referrals. It really was teamwork,” he said. “Get connected with a nurse case manager. They aren’t there to babysit you, and they make sure all your records are updated.”

While he recovered, he found adaptive sports therapy through the Soldier Recovery Unit, a program within the Army Recovery Care Program at Fort Carson, Colorado, and participated in archery, cycling, and field events. That took him all the way to the Army Trials, where he earned a spot on Team Army and a trip to the 2025 Warrior Games. While at the trials, he was awarded “Heart of the Team” from his fellow athletes.

Aside from his U.S. Army teammates, he credits the team at Evans and at Penrose with helping him recover. “They’re all excellent in their own way. They’ve been providing the same care, very professional and on top of things,” he said. “It’s a blessing.”

Service rooted in faith, recovery in adaptive care

Hong, a religious affairs specialist who joined the U.S. Army as a chaplain’s assistant, knows from both perspectives that seeking help is a sign of strength. Chaplains, he learned, are often the first line of defense when service members may be struggling.

“We screen soldiers that may have issues, and we try to link them up with the right resources,” he said. “We try to work very closely with behavioral health, because I think our culture in the military, any branch, if you show any type of weakness—especially mentally—people may get scared or afraid, you know, because they don’t know that resources are out there.”

As one who sought mental health support himself, he encourages anyone to talk to a chaplain for support.

“I think as religious affairs and chaplains, we bring a different perspective. We can introduce you to a resource that might work for you,” he said. “It’s always the safety of the individual that is important. We try to give them all the resources necessary, especially with mental health.”

Backed by team on the way to the games

On the sidelines are Hong’s cheerleaders: his wife, Monica, and family who has been his support throughout all of his health challenges.

“Going to cancer treatment with my wife, having her there next to me, having my sister, going through my treatment— there are days that I didn’t want to do it,” he said. “My children are everything.”

He also credits his military leadership and fellow chaplains for being there for him.

“They were there to sacrifice their time and then all the phone calls that (I made) whenever I needed to talk to somebody like the chaplains, friends, even the leadership, they were there checking up on me. I think that’s so important.”

Hong is also finding strength through his fellow wounded warriors, as they shared stories of recovery and resilience leading up to the Warrior Games.

“When I went to the Army trials, I heard everybody’s different story. And I was like, ‘wow, I want to be part of this,’” he said. “I was seeking a community. It’s so therapeutical and so good for you to be part of a mission.”

Hong is still receiving care, and he feels like he’s in good hands through continued monitoring and checkups: “It’s all hands on deck and they’re doing all of the things they should be doing.” It’s because of his healthcare team, he said, that he can still serve in the U.S. Army.

“It’s harder because I’m not able to do the job that I want to do because of my health, and it took time for me to process, but I’m still here,” he said. “Maybe (serving) can be a different, in the way of helping soldiers and their families and the veterans—a different kind of position, maybe part of a plan to give strength to others who might be going through something similar.”

While at the games in Colorado Springs, he plans to pay homage to a particular healthcare team member while competing: Schuch, his nurse case manager at the SRU.

“My manager’s mom passed away, and she’s from Ireland. So, I’m going to put the Irish flag on my bike and dedicate it for her mom.”

For Hong, his participation at Warrior Games is much bigger than winning. It’s all part of being a team.

“Obviously we want to win because we’re competitive, but we also want to win in every way, shape in life,” he said. “I didn’t get here on my own. I did put in the work, but if you can’t find that fire in yourself, you’ll find people around you that will help you get there.”
