NHB Tobacco Cessation [360-475-4818] and NHB Health Promotion [360-475-5588] offer tailored support to keep anyone's wellbeing from going up in smoke.","Heard the joke about the servicemember who smoked, dipped, and vaped, who asked his provider one day during a routine physical examination, “What’s the end result of having a nicotine habit?”

“Coffin. Not coughing,” replied the physician.

The servicemember didn’t get it.

Defense Health Agency military treatment facilities like Naval Hospital Bremerton do their best to ensure no servicemember ends up the butt of a bad pun due to nicotine usage.

Towards that goal, NHB’s Health Promotion and Wellness Center, in conjunction with Mental Health Directorate’s Tobacco Cessation counselors, uses the American Cancer Society Great American Smoke Out – held on the third Thursday of November - as a designated date to focus on the perils of puffing, the danger of dipping, and hazards to health from toxic vape vapors.

""The GASO provides a national focal point for our annual public health campaigns and allows us to partner with other healthcare professionals to increase awareness, amplify the risks associated with tobacco and nicotine use and encourage tobacco users to quit, at least for one day, and support breaking the nicotine addiction,"" said Patricia Skiner, Health Promotion and Wellness Center department head.

""Our collaborative approach with Mental Health offers a myriad of cessation support to include education, counseling, resources, and medication,"" Skinner added.

From the initial event in the 1970s when smoking and secondhand smoke were commonplace, the goal remains to reach smokers across the nation to use the date and make a plan to quit, or plan in advance and then quit smoking - and dipping and vaping - for just that one day.

Yet old habits die hard. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the Department of Health, Disability and Ageing and numerous additional highly accredited agencies, nicotine is highly addictive.

Dispelling the prevailing smokescreens is a challenge. Health Promotion's campaign has included several static displays offering visual reminders on nicotine peril.

As an example, there are a host of myths associated with e-cigarettes and vaping. One such falsehood is that most e-cigs do not contain nicotine when in fact most e-cigs do contain nicotine, with some as much nicotine as 20 cigarettes. The American Heart Association notes that another fallacy is that vaping is a safe alternative to smoking. Not so. Most e-cigarettes deliver nicotine, which is highly addictive.

Skinner adamantly pointed out vaping awareness is crucial for understanding misconceptions about the product.

""Many people, especially youth, believe vapes contain only water vapor or harmless flavorings, when in fact, e-cigarette aerosol contains cancer-causing agents, heavy metals and flavorings linked to serious lung diseases,"" explained Skinner, adding that using a vape - also referred to as e-cigarette - product comes with huge health hazard.

""[There's] addiction risks. Vaping can lead to nicotine addiction, which is difficult to break and can make individuals more vulnerable to other substance addictions in the future.""

It's been documented that any type of nicotine usage can compromise not just a user's personal well-being but also affect their own operational readiness status. Quitting improves a person’s night vision, enhances mental activity, increases lung capacity, amongst other gains.

""Brain development and physical health! Nicotine is highly addictive and harmful to the brain and body. Awareness helps prevent issues with attention, learning, mood, and impulse control,"" said Skinner.

Those who smoke, dip or vape can also affect those around them.

""The impact of vaping extends beyond the user! Secondhand aerosol can expose bystanders, like family members, friends, and coworkers to nicotine, volatile organic compounds, like benzene, and heavy metals,"" shared Skinner.

Over the years, NHB’s Substance Abuse Rehabilitation Program team has confronted a variety of reasons why a person started using tobacco. There’s also a host of rationalizations that a user will fall back on to convince others, as well as themselves that it’s okay to still go ahead and smoke or dip. Nicotine does not like to be told what not to do.

Butt, it can be done by anyone who is persistent, patient and passionate to quit.

The Department of Defense YouCanQuite2 program recommends the following six steps to quit vaping [ [https://www.ycq2.org/wp-content/uploads/YouCanQuit2_Quit-Vaping-Factsheet.pdf](https://www.ycq2.org/wp-content/uploads/YouCanQuit2_Quit-Vaping-Factsheet.pdf) ]

Remember why you want to quit.

Maybe you want to quit to break the tie to nicotine or protect your health. Keep that reason in your back pocket at all times. Literally. Make your reason the background on your phone or keep a note in your pocket – personal motivation is powerful when quitting.

Identify triggers.

When you try to quit, certain places (like the bar) or your buddies vaping around you, may make you want to join in. Make a plan to avoid triggers as much as possible and find replacement activities for the times you used to vape.

Fight cravings like a pro.

Some vape products have more nicotine than traditional cigarettes. Know exactly how to fight

nicotine cravings so that when you feel one coming on, you hit the gym, grab some lemon water or call a friend to redirect your attention. Talk to your health care provider about other options such as nicotine replacement therapy.

Talk to your support system.

The people who care about you want to see you succeed. Share how you are feeling - the good, the bad, the ugly and everything in between.

Quit together.

Quitting may not seem like the “cool thing” to do, but as the dangers of vaping become clearer, it’s possible your buddy wants to quit too. Show your strength by asking them to quit with you and let them know it’s easier to quit together.

Celebrate your accomplishments.

Every milestone is important during your quit journey – starting with conquering those first 24

hours vape free. Celebrate these moments because it will help you fight cravings and stress.

Add into the mix that there are even associated smoldering safety fears to consider with using e-cigs. There have been explosions and small fires attributed to them, either due to some type of battery malfunction, overheating, or detonation. Users have been scorched and torched.

NHB’s Tobacco Cessation program - the longest running and most successful in the Navy - has been managed clinically by Substance Abuse Rehabilitation Program counselors since 1998 when it was recognized that nicotine dependence was like alcohol or any other substance and it needed to be treated as such.

We’ll include another somber one-liner to wrap up: Nicotine products are also a leading cause of statistics with over 1,000 people stop smoking, dipping and vaping every day.

Punchline: That's because they've all taken their last breath.

Higher Rates of Autism Found in Kids Whose Parents Served in the Military appeared first on Children’s Health Defense.","By Brenda Baletti, Ph.D.

Children in U.S. military families are diagnosed with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) at higher rates than children in civilian families, according to a new preprint study by scientists at Children’s Health Defense (CHD).

CHD scientists Karl Jablonowski, Ph.D., and Brian Hooker, Ph.D., examined nearly eight years of data from the U.S. Census Bureau’s National Survey of Children’s Health (NSCH).

“The signal for autism in children of U.S. military service personnel has lain undetected in census bureau data for many years. The men and women who serve in our military deserve better,” Jablonowski told The Defender.

“Everyone who wears the uniform knows there is an individual risk to service,” he added. “These findings show there is also a previously unknown risk to the neurological health of their children. ‘The ultimate sacrifice’ has more than one meaning.”

The researchers analyzed more than 330,000 child health records collected between 2016 and 2023, focusing on two questions. Were the children covered by military insurance (Tricare or other military health plans)? And did their parents ever serve in the U.S. Armed Forces, Reserves or National Guard?

They also wanted to know if the parents were male or female, if they were active duty or in the reserves, and if either of those factors affected whether or not the children developed autism.

Among the 333,152 children included in the analysis, 3.19% of children covered by civilian insurance and 4.12% of children covered by Tricare or other military insurance had an ASD diagnosis.

After statistical adjustments, the data showed that children with military insurance were 30.73% more likely to have an ASD diagnosis compared with children covered by civilian insurance. In every year examined, the autism rate for Tricare-insured children was higher than that of their civilian counterparts.

They also found that children of mothers with any military service were 46.19% more likely to be diagnosed with ASD than children whose mothers did not serve in the military.

Children of fathers with any service history were 42.74% more likely to have an ASD diagnosis than children of fathers with no military history.

Among those children, the severity pattern was even more pronounced. Those children were 37.37% more likely to be diagnosed with mild ASD, 45.64% more likely to be diagnosed with moderate ASD and 82.73% more likely to be diagnosed with severe ASD than children whose fathers didn’t serve in the military.

For fathers, the authors documented a clear gradient: the likelihood of ASD was lowest among children of non-military fathers and highest among children whose fathers were deployed while on active duty.

Possible causes ‘must be investigated with all due haste’

The authors argued that because “toxic exposures play a large part in metabolic and neurologic dysfunction,” environmental or occupational exposures associated with military service may contribute to the higher rates of diagnosis.

Although the study does not directly measure such exposures, the authors highlighted several examples of known or suspected hazards within military settings.

Some bases, such as Camp Lejeune, have had drinking water contamination issues in the past.

Other possible toxic exposures include exposure to PFAS (per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances) through firefighting foams; medical exposures unique to deployed environments; or other industrial and environmental toxins generally associated with military operations, and increased vaccination rates among military families.

They suggested that the stronger associations seen with moderate and severe ASD may indicate a “severity-response” pattern consistent with harmful exposures, though they emphasize that more precise data are required to evaluate this possibility.

The authors explained that there could be some bias in the data that affects the results, including: survey bias, where military parents whose children have an ASD diagnosis may be more inclined to complete the National Survey of Children’s Health; selection patterns, where service members may be more or less likely to adopt or care for children with disabilities; or diagnostic differences, where variations in healthcare access or evaluation practices between military and civilian systems may influence how often ASD is identified.

“Though there are several explanations for the results of this analysis, child exposure to toxins, either directly or through their parents, cannot be ignored and must be investigated with all due haste,” the authors wrote.

BACKGROUND

Dyspnea has been described in up to 10–30% of patients post-SARS-CoV-2 infection. The underlying pathology for these persistent symptoms remains poorly understood. This study aimed to characterize changes in cardiopulmonary anatomical structure and physiology that may explain ongoing dyspnea after COVID-19.

METHODS

Participants had a history of symptomatic COVID-19, were between 18 and 65 years of age, and without significant pre-existing cardiopulmonary disease. Each participant underwent prospective chest high resolution computed tomography (HRCT), transthoracic echocardiography (TTE), electrocardiogram (ECG), pulmonary function testing (PFT) with lung volumes and diffusing capacity for carbon monoxide (DLCO), impulse oscillometry (IOS), and a six-minute walk test (6MWT) with Borg dyspnea scoring.

RESULTS

Among 115 enrolled participants, 39 had persistent dyspnea. The mean forced expiratory volume at 1 s/forced vital capacity (FEV1/FVC) ratio was higher in those with persistent dyspnea, but within normal ranges for both groups. There were no other statistically significant differences in FEV1, FVC, and DLCO between the groups. Those with ongoing dyspnea had a decreased walk distance (difference of 50.4 m, P = .01). Resting and post-6MWT Borg scores were 0.9 and 1.3 higher in those with persistent dyspnea, respectively (P-values <.001). There were no significant differences in IOS, HRCT, TTE, or ECG findings between groups.

CONCLUSIONS

This study demonstrated a difference in 6MWT distance and Borg scores between those with and without persistent dyspnea. There were no clear PFT, cardiac test, or HRCT findings that explained these persistent symptoms. Overall, this study demonstrates both subjective and objective differences between those with ongoing dyspnea following COVID-19 that are not explained by standard investigations typically ordered in clinical care for chronic dyspnea. These findings underscore the importance of further research into the etiology of post-COVID-19 dyspnea, including other investigations which may detect more subtle alterations in pulmonary physiology.

And if you’re being seen on base, I believe you can still switch your plan back to select?

I have the John’s Hopkins in Norfolk. I like it overall, but it can be a pain having to get referrals for everything. I can usually do telehealth with my PCM or with any of their available doctors to get a referral, so I have never had to wait more than a few days for any appt. I’ve had it for two years and don’t plan to change it. I don’t have kids, so can’t speak to that, but I have had to see a few specialists and didn’t have any issues with getting timely appts. The only downside is no one has heard of this insurance, and they’re always confused when I first explain what it is.

Select is available to family members everywhere regardless of how close you are to a military installation. If you are still in your Qualifying Life Event window from moving you can switch immediately. If you’re not, it’s currently open enrollment. You can switch and it takes affect January 1.

When we were stationed in NY, I was on US Family Health Plan under Martins Point. It was the best insurance experience I’ve ever had. I would kill to be back on US Family Health Plan. I could pick any doctor who took it. Never paid for anything out of pocket except for pharmacy which was CHEAP. And due to having a very rare cancer in the past, when it was time for yearly checks, they worked with my doctor outside of coverage range (like over 700 miles away) to cover everything (including CT scans) without needing prior authorization. I cannot suggest US Family Health Plan more!",,N,1.0,2025-11-20 20:56:25.801343

“This bipartisan legislation will provide critical transparency to military families, and keep the rug from getting ripped out from under them.
Especially amid rising health care costs in the Hudson Valley and nationwide, we have to be all-hands-on-deck to deliver much-needed relief to military families across the country.
Our military families have stepped up and sacrificed for us, now we need to do right by them.” The introduction of the legislation follows Ryan’s recent reintroduction of the bipartisan “Health Care Fairness for Military Families Act” in July.
Military families and retirees currently face complex healthcare transitions that can cause confusion and unexpected costs, a news release said.","KINGSTON, N.Y. — U.S. Rep Pat Rayan, an Iraq War veteran, has continued his push to help military families by co-sponsoring a bill that, if enacted, would give “adequate, advanced information before any changes to their (healthcare) coverage go into effect,” the congressman’s office said.

Ryan, D-Gardiner, who represents the 18th Congressional District, has co-sponsored the “TRICARE Transition Transparency Act.” It is designed to to ensure “that the rug cannot be ripped out from under military families with regard to their health care, and that they have the time and information they need to plan, budget, and make informed decisions,” his office said in a news release Tuesday.

“Military families have sacrificed so much for this country — it’s absolutely unacceptable that their coverage can be ripped away without notice. It’s entirely un-American,” Ryan said in a statement. “This bipartisan legislation will provide critical transparency to military families, and keep the rug from getting ripped out from under them. Especially amid rising health care costs in the Hudson Valley and nationwide, we have to be all-hands-on-deck to deliver much-needed relief to military families across the country. Our military families have stepped up and sacrificed for us, now we need to do right by them.”

The introduction of the legislation follows Ryan’s recent reintroduction of the bipartisan “Health Care Fairness for Military Families Act” in July. That legislation has not received a vote on the House floor.

The legislation also aims to fix inequities in healthcare by extending TRICARE eligibility to 26-year-olds and saving an estimated 367,000 American military families as much as $8,724 per year in healthcare costs, according to Ryan’s office.

Military families and retirees currently face complex healthcare transitions that can cause confusion and unexpected costs, a news release said.

Under current rules, dependent children lose regular TRICARE eligibility at age 21 (or 23 if enrolled in school). Families may purchase TRICARE Young Adult coverage until age 26, but premiums exceed $570 per month for TYA Prime and $300 per month for TYA Select. At age 65, beneficiaries must enroll in Medicare Part B to maintain TRICARE for Life coverage — a requirement many retirees learn about too late.

“These transitions often come with little advance notice, leading to missed enrollment windows, coverage gaps, and higher out-of-pocket expenses,” the release said. “This bill ensures beneficiaries receive timely, repeated notifications and clear guidance, allowing them to plan ahead, avoid coverage gaps, and manage costs.”

The “TRICARE Transition Transparency Act” will:

• Require the Department of Defense to notify TRICARE beneficiaries one year, 180 days, and 30 days before a coverage change takes effect.

• Apply to any TRICARE coverage transition requirement, including age-based changes like switching from regular TRICARE to TRICARE Young Adult (TYA) at age 21 (or 23 if a full-time student) and transitioning to TRICARE for Life at age 65.

• Mandate that notices be delivered electronically and supported by an outreach campaign through TRICARE’s website, social media, and family readiness groups.

• Require an annual report to Congress with metrics on outreach effectiveness and recommendations for improvement.",https://www.dailyfreeman.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/DFN-L-pat-ryan-hed-01.jpg?w=1024&h=575,N,0.0,2025-11-20 18:56:27.667897

""There was a large list, the carrier was very easy to work with,"" said DeMarco, a mother of three and a behavioral health professional.
Arizona is not new to the managed care model, which means the state does not directly provide or administer most care.
In the Medicare Advantage plans, 55% of listed behavioral health providers were inactive; in Medicaid managed care plans, 28% were inactive.
HHS-OIG surveyed providers to understand why they stop participating in Medicaid managed care and Medicare Advantage networks.","PHOENIX -- Joseph DeMarco was about to turn 19 when he first showed the signs of a severe mental health condition.

By then, his family had already switched insurance plans from TRICARE, a health plan for military personnel, retirees and their families, to Mercy Care, a large nonprofit insurer that contracts with AHCCCS, Arizona's Medicaid program.

Joseph's mother, Seetha DeMarco, said they never struggled to find mental health providers under TRICARE.

""There was a large list, the carrier was very easy to work with,"" said DeMarco, a mother of three and a behavioral health professional. ""I didn't contact a provider that was no longer enrolled with TRICARE.""

Things changed after the switch, she said.

""Each and every time I've contacted Mercy Care to identify a provider in the network, they direct you to a website with a list,"" she said. ""It would take days to go through that list and find a provider that is active and enrolled with Mercy.""

She said they didn't find a competent provider until 2025, nearly 10 years later.

The impact extends beyond inconvenience: without timely care, people with serious mental illness often experience worsening symptoms, instability or repeated crises.

DeMarco's experience reflects what federal investigators have identified as ""ghost networks.""

A ""ghost network is really a directory of providers that's just largely unreachable, out of network or doesn't accept new patients,"" said Meridith Seife, deputy regional inspector general and a co-author of the recent report from the Office of Inspector General (OIG) at the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services.

Companies that operate private Medicare Advantage and Medicaid managed care plans have inflated and inaccurate lists of psychologists, psychiatrists, social workers and other mental health providers they say are available to subscribers, the report found.

That runs counter to federal rules requiring plans to keep their directories current. The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services mandates updates every quarter or within 30 days when a provider's status changes.

Arizona is not new to the managed care model, which means the state does not directly provide or administer most care. The state pioneered Medicaid managed care by creating AHCCCS, the first mandatory statewide program, funded mainly by the federal government, with the remaining quarter covered by the state.

The program's proposed budget for fiscal 2025 is approximately $22.3 billion. Private insurers that contract with AHCCCS to deliver most of the physical and behavioral health services to eligible Arizonans are paid monthly per-member capitation payments from those public funds.

""There was a significant percentage of providers that were inactive, meaning they had not provided a single service throughout an entire year,"" Seife said. ""Almost three-quarters of them should not have been listed in those network directories.""

HHS-OIG reviewed plans across 10 counties in five states, sampling one urban and one rural county in each, targeting ""geographically representative samples around the country."" Urban Maricopa and rural Santa Cruz counties in Arizona were included in the report. In the Medicare Advantage plans, 55% of listed behavioral health providers were inactive; in Medicaid managed care plans, 28% were inactive.

HHS-OIG surveyed providers to understand why they stop participating in Medicaid managed care and Medicare Advantage networks. Many described the administrative workload as overwhelming.

""Keeping up with them (administrative requirements) is nearly impossible and clinical staff feel like they are just cogs in a wheel versus clinicians,"" Seife said.

Other providers cited reimbursement rates that do not cover the cost of care, making continued participation financially unsustainable.

To address these issues, HHS-OIG recommends steps to reduce the administrative requirements and create a centralized, nationwide directory that would be a ""single place that providers could list all the insurance plans they participate in, their correct addresses,"" Seife said.

In a written statement to Cronkite News, AHCCCS acknowledged the challenges and outlined ongoing efforts, stating the agency recognizes ""that timely access to behavioral health services is critical to the well-being of our members, and we share the OIG's commitment to improving transparency and accountability in provider networks.""

The AHCCCS statement highlighted ongoing efforts to improve care access, including increased monitoring of network adequacy, reducing administrative hurdles for providers, investing in behavioral health workforce development and exploring improvements to public-facing provider search tools.

The state agency noted that rural and tribal communities remain the most impacted by provider shortages.

Cronkite News reached out to a number of private insurance companies operating in Arizona; however, none had responded by the time of publication.

The Army Substance Abuse Program (ASAP) is the U.S. Army’s comprehensive substance abuse program designed to strengthen the overall fitness and effectiveness of military and civilian personnel while maintaining combat readiness.

This command-directed initiative addresses alcohol and other drug abuse through prevention strategies, drug abuse deterrence, and treatment services for active duty soldiers, civilian corps members, and family members.

The Army ASAP program operates under AR 600-85 to enhance the combat readiness of the Army’s workforce while providing critical intervention services for substance-impaired soldiers and civilian personnel assigned to Army installations.

Our guide from TriCareRehabs.com will break down the details on what you need to know, so that you (or your loved one) can get answers and the proper forms of support.

What This Guide Covers

This comprehensive guide covers ASAP program structure, eligibility requirements, enrollment procedures, and available treatment resources. It does NOT include detailed medical treatment protocols or clinical procedures, and should not be construed as medical advice, but focuses on practical information for accessing services and understanding program benefits.

Who This Is For

This guide is designed for active duty soldiers, commanders, military families, DA civilian employees, and Army National Guard members. Whether you’re seeking prevention education, need treatment referral information, or want to understand command responsibilities, you’ll find actionable guidance for navigating ASAP services.

Why This Matters

Substance abuse issues can jeopardize readiness, reduce individual fitness, and impact overall unit readiness. ASAP provides essential services to maintain maximum productivity, reduce absenteeism, and preserve military careers while ensuring personnel assigned to Army units remain mission-ready. For those requiring additional support beyond ASAP services, consulting with TriCareRehabs.com provides access to confidential TRICARE-approved treatment options.

Understanding the Army Substance Abuse Program (ASAP)

The Army Substance Abuse Program is a command program that implements alcohol and other drug abuse deterrence, prevention education, while providing rehabilitation services to restore personnel to continued military service.

ASAP operates as both a prevention initiative and clinical treatment resource, designed to achieve maximum productivity among military personnel while reducing substance abuse-related attrition. It is akin to similar programs in other branches of the Armed Forces, such as:

The Navy SARP Program

The Air Force ADAPT and DDRP Programs

The Coast Guard Substance Abuse Program

The Marine Corps Substance Abuse Program

National Guard Substance Abuse Programs

The program’s mission focuses on strengthening workforce effectiveness through comprehensive drug abuse prevention and treatment services. ASAP aims to improve readiness by extending services to soldiers, civilian corps members, and eligible family members while maintaining the overall fitness of Army units.

Program Administration and Governance

ASAP operates under the Army Center for Substance Abuse Programs (ACSAP) authority, following regulations including AR 600-85, MEDCOM Reg 40-51, and DA Pam 600-85. This oversight structure ensures appropriately trained ASAP staff deliver consistent services across installations while maintaining command support for substance abuse prevention and education efforts.

Local installation ASAP offices implement prevention strategies that respond to unit-specific needs while coordinating with commanders to encourage alcohol and drug-free environments. This connects to overall program effectiveness because standardized policies ensure all personnel assigned receive military medical services access regardless of duty location.

Core Program Components

ASAP delivers prevention education through campaigns like “Too Much to Lose,” emphasizing alcohol and other drug awareness among foreign national employees, citizen DOD civilian employees, and military personnel. These drug abuse deterrence prevention initiatives target high-risk behaviors such as on-duty intoxication and DUI activity before they impact unit readiness.

Building on prevention efforts, treatment programs provide comprehensive intervention for substance misuse cases. Treatment services include assessment, counseling, and rehabilitation designed to return to duty those substance-impaired soldiers who can successfully continue military service.

ASAP Eligibility and Enrollment

ASAP services extend to multiple Army populations with varying levels of access based on duty status and location. The program objectives increase individual fitness while providing services to maximize treatment accessibility across Army components.

Who Qualifies for ASAP Services?

Active duty soldiers automatically receive military medical services access, including ASAP prevention and treatment programs. These personnel can access both prevention education and clinical treatment services at their assigned installations.

DA civilian employees with occupational health services access qualify for ASAP services, including alcohol and other drugs prevention education and employee assistance programs. Retired military personnel may receive services on a space-available basis, depending on installation capacity.

Army National Guard and Reserve members receive services when on active duty, with space-available access during non-active periods. This ensures readiness by extending services to all Army components while managing resource allocation effectively.

Referral Pathways for ASAP Participation

Command referral represents the primary pathway for accessing ASAP services, where commanders identify soldiers requiring intervention and direct participation in prevention or treatment programs. This process encourages commanders to address substance abuse issues before they impact overall unit readiness.

Self-reporting and self-referral protections under AR 600-85 allow personnel to voluntarily seek ASAP services without immediate career consequences. These protections emphasize alcohol and other drug abuse prevention while encouraging early intervention for substance abuse issues.

Medical referral occurs when healthcare providers identify potential substance misuse during routine care or emergency treatment. This pathway ensures comprehensive screening and appropriate treatment referrals for prescription drug misuse and other substance abuse concerns.

Geographic Coverage and Installation Programs

Installation-specific ASAP offices operate at major Army posts, including Fort Hood, Fort Irwin, and other locations worldwide. Each office provides services tailored to local unit needs while maintaining standardized prevention strategies that respond to installation-specific risk factors.

Service coordination ensures soldiers under other service branches can access appropriate substance abuse prevention and education when stationed at joint installations. This maintains consistency in drug abuse deterrence and prevention education across military services.

What is the ASAP Process and Program Structure?

ASAP operates through structured procedures that balance military requirements with clinical best practices. The program combines immediate intervention capabilities with long-term prevention strategies to maintain the effectiveness of the army’s substance abuse response.

Step-by-Step: ASAP Enrollment Process

When to use this: Guidance for commanders, soldiers, and family members initiating ASAP services.

Initial Contact: Contact the installation ASAP office to schedule an assessment appointment within 72 hours of referral identification.

Comprehensive Assessment: Complete clinical evaluation, including substance use history, risk factors, and treatment recommendations by appropriately trained staff.

Treatment Planning: Develop an individualized plan addressing specific needs, whether prevention education, counseling, or intensive treatment services.

Program Participation: Attend scheduled sessions, including individual counseling, group education, or specialized treatment based on assessment results.

Progress Monitoring: Regular evaluation with ASAP staff and command to ensure treatment compliance and readiness maintenance.

Comparison: Prevention vs Treatment Tracks in the Army ASAP

Feature Prevention Track Treatment Track Duration 4-8 hours of education 3-6 months intensive Intensity Group workshops Individual + group therapy Career Impact Minimal documentation Formal treatment record Outcomes Education completion Rehabilitation goals

Prevention tracks focus on drug abuse deterrence and prevention education for low-risk personnel, while treatment tracks provide comprehensive intervention for diagnosed substance abuse cases.

Community programs hosted by ASAP raise awareness about alcohol and drug misuse and include initiatives for suicide prevention.

This structure allows commanders to match intervention intensity with individual needs while maintaining overall fitness and effectiveness.

Common Challenges and Solutions for Recovery Support in the Army

ASAP implementation faces recurring obstacles that can impact program effectiveness and soldier participation. These challenges require proactive solutions to maintain the program’s role in reducing absenteeism and attrition among civilian corps members and military personnel.

Challenge 1: Fear of Career Impact

Solution: Self-reporting and referral protections under AR 600-85 prevent immediate punitive action for voluntary participation in ASAP services. Commanders must provide reasonable accommodation for treatment participation while maintaining mission requirements.

AR 600-85 specifically protects soldiers who self-identify substance abuse issues before misconduct occurs, enabling early intervention without career termination. This encourages participation in prevention strategies that respond to individual risk factors.

Self-reporting before a failed drug test in the Army is a proactive way of getting support, and our caring, expert staff at TriCareRehabs.com can assist with a confidential consultation.

Challenge 2: Accessing Services at Remote Locations

Solution: Space-available services ensure personnel assigned to remote locations can access ASAP resources through regional offices or temporary duty assignments. Virtual counseling and community partnerships expand service availability beyond installation boundaries.

Installation coordination allows soldiers at smaller posts to receive services through larger regional ASAP offices, ensuring consistent access to abuse prevention and education regardless of assignment location.

Challenge 3: Balancing Mission Requirements with Treatment

Solution: Commanders must accommodate treatment schedules while maintaining operational readiness through flexible scheduling and duty modifications. ASAP staff coordinate with units to minimize mission impact during intensive treatment phases.

Treatment planning includes mission consideration to ensure continued military service remains viable while addressing substance abuse effectively. This balance maintains unit readiness while providing necessary clinical intervention.

Transition: Addressing these challenges supports successful ASAP participation and opens discussion of additional treatment resources.

Neuronetics remains the only TMS manufacturer with a dedicated health policy team, positioning the company to accelerate payer adoption as demand for non-pharmacological depression treatments grows.

(NASDAQ: STIM) announced a significant coverage expansion for its NeuroStar transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) therapy, as TriWest — the regional administrator for TRICARE — updated its medical policy to include adolescents aged 15 and older. The change is effective immediately and applies across 26 states, marking one of the broadest adolescent mental health coverage decisions yet for TMS.

TRICARE serves active-duty military members, retirees, and eligible dependents. With the inclusion of adolescents, military families in states spanning from California and Texas to Illinois and Washington now have access to a non-drug treatment option for major depressive disorder (MDD) at a time when adolescent depression rates continue to rise.

“TRICARE’s decision to expand coverage for TMS to adolescents is a significant step forward,” said Keith J. Sullivan, President and CEO of Neuronetics. He emphasized that the update reinforces the need for evidence-based treatments and expands access to patients who have historically faced limited therapeutic options.

Geoffrey Grammer, MD, the company’s Chief Medical Officer and a retired U.S. Army Colonel, noted the unique emotional burdens faced by children of service members. He said the decision ensures that military families “receive the care and support that honors their families’ service to our nation.”

Roughly 4.3 million U.S. adolescents aged 15–21 are affected by major depression. Treatment options approved for adolescent patients remain limited, giving TMS an increasingly important role as a first-line or add-on therapy. NeuroStar received FDA clearance for adolescents in 2024, and coverage has since expanded across multiple major insurers, including Aetna, Humana, Cigna’s Evernorth, and BlueCross BlueShield HCSC.

Category 1—Active-duty service members.

Category 2—Command-sponsored family members of active-duty and survivors of service members who died on active-duty and are enrolled at NMRTC Sigonella or its Branch Health Clinics.

Category 3—Active-duty family members that are not command sponsored and/or the sponsor is not assigned to a command supported by NMRTC Sigonella. This category also includes retirees and their family members.

Category 4—Other eligible beneficiaries. This includes employees of the Department of Defense Education Activity (DoDEA), contractors, retirees, family members of these beneficiaries, and survivors of service members who died on active duty who are not enrolled in TRICARE.

Civilian employees, contractors, retirees, veterans, non-activated reservists, and their respective dependents are eligible only for limited emergency care and will receive a bill for their visit. However, retirees who completed 20 years of service will not be billed for emergencies.

As highlighted by TRICARE’s official enrollment guide, active duty members must enroll in TRICARE Prime or Prime Remote, while others have more options.","Who Qualifies for TRICARE? Understanding Your Eligibility

Before diving into the registration process, let’s clarify who actually qualifies for TRICARE. This health care program is designed primarily for military service members, their families, retirees, and survivors. But it’s not as straightforward as just having a military connection. Your eligibility depends on your relationship to the military and your status.

For example, active duty service members must be enrolled in specific plans like TRICARE Prime or TRICARE Prime Remote. Also, National Guard and Reserve members who aren’t on active duty might have different options or eligibility windows.

Eligible family members include spouses, children under 21 (or 23 if dependent and enrolled in school), and even some former spouses depending on circumstances. Retired military personnel and their families also qualify, as well as survivors of deceased service members.

It’s worth noting that certain categories such as Medal of Honor recipients and their families may qualify for specialized TRICARE plans.

To double-check if you qualify, the TRICARE website maintains a handy eligibility quiz and detailed guides for each category. It’s a quick first step that saves headaches down the line.

Step 1: Gathering Essential Documents for a Smooth Registration

Nothing slows things down faster than realizing you don’t have the paperwork you need when signing up. Before you touch the enrollment portal, gather these key documents:

Military ID or DD-214 — Proof of your service status or retirement

Social Security Number (SSN) — Required for all applicants

Dependent Information — Birth certificates, marriage certificates, or adoption papers for beneficiaries

Proof of Residence — Utility bill or similar document showing your current address

Primary Care Manager (PCM) details (if you have a preference or are transferring plans)

Having these ready can make the enrollment process much faster and keep frustration at bay. Also, keep a valid email address handy since TRICARE will send updates and confirmations digitally.

A little heads-up: if you plan to enroll online, it’s smart to create a MyTRICARE account first, which simplifies the whole login and tracking experience.

Step 2: Navigating the TRICARE Enrollment Portal Like a Pro

The main tool for registration nowadays is the Beneficiary Web Enrollment (BWE) system. This online portal is user-friendly and designed to make your life easier — no need to juggle paperwork or wait on hold.

Here’s the basic flow:

Visit the official enrollment page, which you can find here.

Create or log in to your MyTRICARE account.

Fill in your personal information and upload your documents as required.

Select your preferred TRICARE plan and choose your Primary Care Manager if applicable.

Review your application carefully, then submit.

Watch your inbox for confirmation and further instructions.

A useful tip: you can pay your initial enrollment fees directly on the portal if your plan requires it.

And yes, the portal also lets you update your information or change plans down the road, which is handy.

For those who prefer video guidance, check out this walkthrough on how to register for TRICARE Online Secure Messaging. Seeing the steps in action can make the process feel a lot less intimidating.

Learning to use secure messaging through MyTRICARE not only speeds up communication with providers but also tracks your health info easily. Worth your time!

How to Choose the Right TRICARE Plan Based on Your Lifestyle

Picking the right TRICARE plan is all about what fits your day-to-day life—and your budget. The main options break down like this:

Main TRICARE Plans Overview Plan Who It’s For Costs Key Features TRICARE Prime Active Duty & families, retirees Low copays, enrollment fees for retirees Primary care manager required, referrals needed TRICARE Select Retirees & families No enrollment fee, higher copays than Prime No PCM, self-referral allowed, more flexibility TRICARE Reserve Select Guard and Reserve members (inactive) Affordable monthly premiums Coverage similar to Select, for Reservists

Now, which one fits best depends on your unique needs. Are you someone who values low out-of-pocket costs and doesn’t mind a primary care manager? TRICARE Prime could be your go-to. Prefer more freedom to pick providers and manage your care? TRICARE Select might suit you better.

As highlighted by TRICARE’s official enrollment guide, active duty members must enroll in TRICARE Prime or Prime Remote, while others have more options. Knowing these requirements ahead of time lets you pick a plan that actually works without surprises.

Avoid These Common Registration Pitfalls and Save Time

Let’s be honest: if you’re not familiar with the TRICARE registration flow, it’s easy to slip up. Here are some headaches you can dodge by watching for these common slip-ups:

Submitting incomplete or outdated documents. Triple-check the expiration dates and signatures to keep your application from being kicked back.

Missing enrollment deadlines. Especially during Open Season, late sign-ups can mean paying more or losing coverage temporarily.

Not updating your information after life changes. Moving, adding family members, or retiring should be reported promptly.

Confusing different plan options and requirements. Enrolling in the wrong plan happens more often than you’d think.

“Our research focuses on streamlining medical logistics in combat through drone technology,” said Teague.
“By leveraging our backgrounds in electrical engineering, computer science, and drone warfare, we aim to provide KACH with a practical solution for integrating drone technology into their medical training programs,” said Crossman.
“The collaboration fosters an environment of interdisciplinary learning and innovation, benefiting both KACH staff and USMA cadets,” said Hipp.","WEST POINT, N.Y. – Keller Army Community Hospital (KACH) is actively working to integrate drone technology into military medical operations to enhance soldier health and safety.

The landscape of warfare is rapidly evolving, and the ongoing conflict in Ukraine has underscored the critical role of drone technology in military operations. As autonomous systems (drones) are increasingly utilized for various purposes, including prolonged field care, medical logistics, and patient evacuation, it has become essential for military personnel to become proficient in their use.

Recognizing the increasing importance of sUAS in modern warfare, particularly for medical logistics and prolonged field care, KACH has partnered with the United States Military Academy’s (USMA) Robotics Research Center, within the Electrical Engineering and Computer Sciences (EECS) Department, to address the training gap in drone technology for Army Medical Department (AMEDD) personnel. This collaboration aims to build a foundational understanding of sUAS capabilities among active-duty soldiers and improve patient experience. The partnership exemplifies a forward-thinking approach necessary to enhance healthcare delivery in combat settings.

On September 16-17, 2025, KACH’s Col. Sean J. Hipp, Commander, Lt. Col. Samuel Teague, Chief, Primary Care Dept., Maj. Wesley Snow, Chief, Pharmacy Dept., and Sgt. 1st Class Jamez White, Non-Commissioned Officer-in-Charge, Primary Care Dept., participated in the Medical Autonomous Care-State of the Science (MAC-SOS) Conference at the University of Pittsburgh. MAC-SOS was sponsored by the Defense Health Agency, and brought together experts from government, industry, academia, and regulatory agencies to discuss the development of autonomous care, focusing on both military and civilian applications.

During this event, KACH showcased their poster presentation titled “Overcoming Barriers: Implementing Small Unmanned Aircraft Systems (sUAS) Technology for Medication Delivery at West Point.” The presentation featured the collaborative effort between KACH and the USMA EECS Dept. to deliver medications via sUAS to Cadet Candidates at the United States Military Academy Preparatory School which lacks onsite medical assets.

“Our research focuses on streamlining medical logistics in combat through drone technology,” said Teague. “We believe that by optimizing the delivery of medications and supplies, we can significantly improve response times and ultimately save lives on the battlefield.”

Collaboration began in November 2024, and the successful test flight took place in April 2025 with daily flights expected by the end of December 2025. This project will ensure KACH soldiers can work with sUAS every day and highlights the importance of leveraging drone technology to enhance operational efficiency in military healthcare while ensuring that soldiers gain hands-on experience with these critical tools.

“We are trying to create a system that ensures AMEDD personnel can proficiently operate the sUAS equipment and soldiers will have the ability to have immediate access to medications they require, regardless of where they are located,” said Hipp.

Furthermore, USMA cadets are contributing to the effort through research and development. Cadets Jacob Crossman, Daniel Orfao, and Anant Sabata presented their work on ""Medical Delivery Drones for Combat Operations"" at the MAC-SOS Conference, which was selected as the top abstract. This work emphasizes the potential of sUAS to streamline logistics in combat scenarios.

“By leveraging our backgrounds in electrical engineering, computer science, and drone warfare, we aim to provide KACH with a practical solution for integrating drone technology into their medical training programs,” said Crossman. “We're focused on creating systems that are not only effective but also user-friendly for soldiers in the field.”

The initiative underscores the need to familiarize soldiers with drone technology, providing them with the skills to leverage these tools in combat scenarios. As drones become increasingly embedded in military tactics, training soldiers to understand and operate these technologies is essential for ensuring their safety and effectiveness in the field.

“The collaboration fosters an environment of interdisciplinary learning and innovation, benefiting both KACH staff and USMA cadets,” said Hipp. “The initiative aims to pave the way for effective integration of drone technology into garrison medical operations to build foundational understanding of sUAS capability among active duty while enhancing the patient experience.”",https://d1ldvf68ux039x.cloudfront.net/thumbs/photos/2511/9399759/1000w_q95.jpg,N,0.0,2025-11-20 15:56:32.630369

This is more than a billing issue — it’s a readiness crisis, and orthopaedic surgeons are on the front lines.
Surgeons can use it to restore access, preserve readiness, and ensure that their nation’s service members receive the care they deserve.

Dr. Provencher is the second vice president of the American Orthopaedic Society for Sports Medicine and a past president of the Society of Military Orthopaedic Surgeons.","In October 2023, TRICARE, the civilian health insurance provider for U.S. Armed Forces military personnel, retirees, and dependents, implemented a sweeping change in its reimbursement policy by adopting Medicare’s ambulatory surgical center (ASC) rates. Although the intent may have been administrative alignment, the unintended consequences for military readiness and orthopaedic access have been severe.

Orthopaedic conditions remain the leading cause of non-deployability among active-duty service members. Injuries such as shoulder instability, anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) tears, and ankle sprains often require timely surgical intervention with implantable devices — such as suture anchors, screws, and graft fixation systems — to restore function and expedite return to duty. Although TRICARE does reimburse for certain implants, it imposes caps that frequently fall short of covering the number and type of implants required to perform these common procedures to modern standards. This shortfall puts surgeons in a difficult position: Either absorb the cost, modify the procedure, or defer care altogether.

Many orthopaedic surgeons may not realize that a significant number of service members are referred to civilian providers because their care either exceeds the capabilities of the local military treatment facility (MTF) or the MTF lacks the capacity — limited OR time, surgeon availability, or access to required resources. Civilian support is not an exception; it is a critical extension of the military medical system.

Reimbursement rates for procedures involving implants — particularly those performed in ASCs — have changed significantly under the new model. Procedures such as shoulder arthroscopy, which are staples of orthopaedic sports and military medicine, have seen dramatic reductions in facility payments. For many civilian practices near military installations, these reimbursement shifts have made it financially unviable to continue offering critical care to TRICARE patients, increasingly leading to access limitations for service members and their families.

To quantify the impact of this update, the Society of Military Orthopaedic Surgeons recently surveyed large orthopaedic private practices near major military installations. Responses from practices in both the Eastern and Western TRICARE regions revealed troubling trends:

More than 60% of respondents reported a significant decrease in the number of TRICARE patients they have seen since October 2023.

More than half have discussed or implemented caps on TRICARE patients or specific procedures — particularly arthroscopic surgeries involving implants.

Nearly 80% of respondents reported challenges including delays in care, inability to cover implant costs, and a reduced willingness to accept TRICARE patients.

The responses included powerful statements:

“We’ve had to cancel several scheduled ACL reconstructions because reimbursement wouldn’t cover even the implant costs.”

“We used to perform these procedures weekly for military dependents; now we refer them elsewhere — sometimes out of network or out of state.”

“Our surgeons want to support the mission, but the current rates are financially unsustainable for our ASC partners.”

Compounding the issue is the limited capacity of MTFs. Already stretched by deployments, training, and staffing shortfalls, many MTFs rely on partnerships with civilian ASCs to meet the surgical demands of TRICARE beneficiaries. These partnerships are now collapsing.

This is more than a billing issue — it’s a readiness crisis, and orthopaedic surgeons are on the front lines. When service members wait weeks or months for care that should be provided within days, their ability to return to duty is jeopardized. The nation cannot afford that delay in an era of global uncertainty.

Orthopaedic surgeons understand the financial pressures that may force practices to limit care for TRICARE patients. They recognize that the current reimbursement model makes it difficult — if not impossible — to provide essential procedures in civilian ASC settings.

But this is also the orthopaedic community’s moment to advocate. Orthopaedic surgeons across the country — particularly those in practices near military installations — can make their voices heard by reaching out to their elected federal and state senators and representatives. Surgeons can also share their experiences with national and state surgical societies, participate in data-collection efforts that demonstrate the impact of these policy changes, and educate local military leadership on the challenges and barriers to timely care for their personnel.

The collective voice of the orthopaedic community is powerful. Surgeons can use it to restore access, preserve readiness, and ensure that their nation’s service members receive the care they deserve.

Krameelah Banks, 48, of Little Rock, faces twenty-three counts of wire fraud, seven counts of making false statements in connection with health care, one count of lying to the FBI, and one count of aggravated identity theft. Jonathan Ross, U.S. Attorney for the Eastern District of Arkansas, Alicia Corder, Special Agent in Charge of the FBI Little Rock Field Office, and Jason Meadows, Acting Special Agent in Charge of the Dallas Regional Office of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, Office of the Inspector General, announced the charges.

According to the indictment, Banks owned and operated Arkansas Behavioral Center (ABC). Although Banks treated some regular patients who received ongoing psychotherapy, most of her patients were referrals who were seen just once for the sole purpose of receiving pre-surgical psychological evaluations. It is alleged that from 2021 through 2023, Banks billed for thousands of hours of psychology services that never took place by routinely charging Medicare and Blue Cross for ongoing psychotherapy in the names of persons who were referral patients seen only once, causing insurers to lose over $500,000.

The indictment alleges that Banks billed for services rendered at ABC while vacationing in Florida and Mexico, Banks billed for more than 24 hours’ worth of services rendered in a single day. The indictment also alleges that Banks billed for over 130 sessions rendered to several patients who had long since died.

According to the indictment, Banks responded to inquiries about disputed claims by creating fictitious records and even recycled such entries by providing nearly identical records to Medicare and Blue Cross. The indictment goes on to allege Banks later misled the FBI by blaming any overbilling on her online calendaring software.

An indictment contains only allegations. The defendant is presumed innocent until proven guilty.

“There was a large list, the carrier was very easy to work with,” said DeMarco, a mother of three and a behavioral health professional.
Arizona is not new to the managed care model, which means the state does not directly provide or administer most care.
In the Medicare Advantage plans, 55% of listed behavioral health providers were inactive; in Medicaid managed care plans, 28% were inactive.
HHS-OIG surveyed providers to understand why they stop participating in Medicaid managed care and Medicare Advantage networks.","PHOENIX – Joseph DeMarco was about to turn 19 when he first showed the signs of a severe mental health condition.

By then, his family had already switched insurance plans from TRICARE, a health plan for military personnel, retirees and their families, to Mercy Care, a large nonprofit insurer that contracts with AHCCCS, Arizona’s Medicaid program.

Joseph’s mother, Seetha DeMarco, said they never struggled to find mental health providers under TRICARE.

“There was a large list, the carrier was very easy to work with,” said DeMarco, a mother of three and a behavioral health professional. “I didn’t contact a provider that was no longer enrolled with TRICARE.”

Things changed after the switch, she said.

“Each and every time I’ve contacted Mercy Care to identify a provider in the network, they direct you to a website with a list,” she said. “It would take days to go through that list and find a provider that is active and enrolled with Mercy.”

She said they didn’t find a competent provider until 2025, nearly 10 years later.

The impact extends beyond inconvenience: without timely care, people with serious mental illness often experience worsening symptoms, instability or repeated crises.

DeMarco’s experience reflects what federal investigators have identified as “ghost networks.”

A “ghost network is really a directory of providers that’s just largely unreachable, out of network or doesn’t accept new patients,” said Meridith Seife, deputy regional inspector general and a co-author of the recent report from the Office of Inspector General (OIG) at the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services.

Companies that operate private Medicare Advantage and Medicaid managed care plans have inflated and inaccurate lists of psychologists, psychiatrists, social workers and other mental health providers they say are available to subscribers, the report found.

That runs counter to federal rules requiring plans to keep their directories current. The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services mandates updates every quarter or within 30 days when a provider’s status changes.

Arizona is not new to the managed care model, which means the state does not directly provide or administer most care. The state pioneered Medicaid managed care by creating AHCCCS, the first mandatory statewide program, funded mainly by the federal government, with the remaining quarter covered by the state.

The program’s proposed budget for fiscal 2025 is approximately $22.3 billion. Private insurers that contract with AHCCCS to deliver most of the physical and behavioral health services to eligible Arizonans are paid monthly per-member capitation payments from those public funds.

“There was a significant percentage of providers that were inactive, meaning they had not provided a single service throughout an entire year,” Seife said. “Almost three-quarters of them should not have been listed in those network directories.”

HHS-OIG reviewed plans across 10 counties in five states, sampling one urban and one rural county in each, targeting “geographically representative samples around the country.” Urban Maricopa and rural Santa Cruz counties in Arizona were included in the report. In the Medicare Advantage plans, 55% of listed behavioral health providers were inactive; in Medicaid managed care plans, 28% were inactive.

HHS-OIG surveyed providers to understand why they stop participating in Medicaid managed care and Medicare Advantage networks. Many described the administrative workload as overwhelming.

“Keeping up with them (administrative requirements) is nearly impossible and clinical staff feel like they are just cogs in a wheel versus clinicians,” Seife said.

Other providers cited reimbursement rates that do not cover the cost of care, making continued participation financially unsustainable.

To address these issues, HHS-OIG recommends steps to reduce the administrative requirements and create a centralized, nationwide directory that would be a “single place that providers could list all the insurance plans they participate in, their correct addresses,” Seife said.

In a written statement to Cronkite News, AHCCCS acknowledged the challenges and outlined ongoing efforts, stating the agency recognizes “that timely access to behavioral health services is critical to the well-being of our members, and we share the OIG’s commitment to improving transparency and accountability in provider networks.”

The AHCCCS statement highlighted ongoing efforts to improve care access, including increased monitoring of network adequacy, reducing administrative hurdles for providers, investing in behavioral health workforce development and exploring improvements to public-facing provider search tools.

The state agency noted that rural and tribal communities remain the most impacted by provider shortages.

Cronkite News reached out to a number of private insurance companies operating in Arizona; however, none had responded by the time of publication.

Seetha DeMarco said improvement must move beyond policy announcements.

“There’s going to be a time where I’m not going to be there to advocate for (my children) and for the level of care and support that they need. … This is a human crisis,” she said. “We’ve got great laws (in Arizona), we’ve got great policy, it just hasn’t been implemented.”",https://cronkitenews.azpbs.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Workers-tend-to-patients-in-the-emergency-room-at-Banner-University-Medical-Center-Phoenix.-File-photo-by-Johanna-HuckebaCronkite-News-scaled.jpg,N,1.0,2025-11-19 15:56:19.423753

Military families have carried this burden long enough, and Congress has the power to fix it now.
Take Action Join us in asking Congress to support the Health Care Fairness for Military Families Act.","As TRICARE Open Season begins, many families are weighing their coverage options. But for thousands of military-connected young adults and their parents, Open Season is little more than a reminder of a painful reality: their children don’t get the same protection that their civilian counterparts do.

While civilian families can keep their dependents on their health insurance until age 26, military families face a hard cutoff at 21 or 23 if their child is a full-time student. After that, the only TRICARE option is TRICARE Young Adult (TYA); a plan whose premiums have skyrocketed more than 280 percent since 2015.

To add insult to injury, TYA will now cost $794 per month for TYA Prime and $363 per month for TYA Select beginning January 1, 2026.

These are not small annual increases. They are life-altering financial blows and families from every branch of service are telling us exactly what that looks like.

Military Families Speak Out

“These young adults don’t deserve this.” – Air Force family

One Air Force family watched their 23-year-old lose TRICARE coverage in September, just months before graduating college.

Their middle daughter, a tattoo artist, never qualified for the student exception, and was dropped at 21. She now pays over $700 a month for TYA coverage, which is more than her rent. Her mom told us:

“When I know if she wasn’t paying $700 a month for insurance she wouldn’t have had to work two jobs and have had a mental breakdown from the stress. These young adults don’t deserve this.”

Military kids grow up serving, too. They move repeatedly, start over again and again, and still fight to build a future. Yet many are punished with unaffordable health insurance premiums at the very moment they’re trying to launch their adult lives.

“How is this right?” – Army spouse

Another Army spouse shared that her daughter was cut off TRICARE at 21 because she wasn’t enrolled full-time. “We can’t afford TRICARE Young Adult, and the Affordable Care Act is about to be gutted. Here we are, 25 years of service, and we can’t afford our 22-year-old’s health insurance. The law for the ACA is 26 but not for the government. How is this right?”

It’s not right. It’s not fair. And it’s certainly not what military-connected families deserve.

Families Are Being Forced Into Impossible Situations

For many, the financial strain is so intense that they are delaying education, skipping necessary medical care, or going without coverage entirely.

A retired Marine shared that he had to purchase a separate insurance plan, over $500 a month, just to ensure his 21-year-old son remained covered.

Another parent, a retired Air Force veteran, said her daughter wants to gain work experience before applying to graduate school, but will be unable to afford healthcare. “She has been a military child all her life. She will soon have her degree but would like to take a gap year to gain experience. She will be unable to afford her healthcare if she is no longer eligible. Please consider pushing through eligibility until age 26.”

These stories all point to the same truth: military families are being inadvertently punished with higher healthcare costs simply because they’ve served.

“My children should not be punished.” – Greg P., retired Navy

Greg served 24 years in the Navy. Now, as a retiree, he’s watching his own children face impossible costs that civilian families never encounter.

“My children should not be punished in TRICARE Young Adult health care premium costs because of my military service.” Upon learning about a potential legislative fix, Greg said, “This change would provide stability during a critical life stage for dependent military children aged 22-25.”

Greg is right. At a time when young adults are finishing school, building careers, or transitioning into independence, healthcare shouldn’t be the barrier that derails their future.

A Simple Fix Exists and Congress Must Act

The Health Care Fairness for Military Families Act (H.R. 4768 / S. 2448) would finally align TRICARE with civilian healthcare standards by allowing military-connected young adults to stay on their parents’ plan until age 26.

This is not a new or radical idea. It is already the standard across America through the Affordable Care Act (ACA).

From the Air Force spouse whose daughter suffered a breakdown from unmanageable premiums to the Marine veteran paying for two insurance plans at once, every story we’ve heard shows why this change is urgently needed.

Military families have carried this burden long enough, and Congress has the power to fix it now.

“The Illinois Army National Guard is there for our neighbors when they need help, but they’re working out of aging facilities that make their jobs harder and put at risk the mission readiness we rely on when the next disaster strikes,” Sorensen said. “A new readiness center in Peoria will replace 50-year-old buildings that have roofs giving way, sides crumbling, and outdated heating systems. It will ensure the Guard is ready to quickly deploy anywhere in the state to an emergency.”

The funding for the readiness center comes from the FY26 Military Construction and Veterans Affairs Appropriations bill that was passed as part of the broader funding package last week that reopened the government.

While Sorensen voted against the underlying funding package because it failed to address rising healthcare costs for his constituents, he strongly supports this investment in Peoria, having worked closely with the Illinois Congressional delegation to ensure it was included.

“Operational medicine requires speed, accuracy, and resilience,” said Muravyov. “Our platform was designed with those realities in mind. By integrating clinical documentation, health data analytics, logistics support, and data synchronization into one secure system, OpMed CDP will be a foundational aspect for the Defense Health Agency’s advancement into a new era of precision and efficiency in military healthcare.”

“With medical knowledge doubling every 73 days, the pace of change is extraordinary,” said USU President Dr. Jonathan Woodson. “USU’s role is to ensure the Military Health System is not just keeping up, but leading—so our warfighters receive the most advanced care anywhere in the world.”

Driving Innovation: AI, Advanced Wound Care, and Graduate Education

USU is leveraging technology and foundational science to solve the most pressing challenges facing the battlefield.

AI Revolutionizes Wound Care

The School of Medicine (SOM) is applying AI to revolutionize clinical practice. Specifically, the Surgical Critical Care Initiative (SC2i) leverages Google Cloud technology, including Google AI, to develop Clinical Decision Support Tools (CDSTs), which accelerate the timeline for biomarker discovery from months to weeks.

This advanced work is already demonstrating real-world value. The successful use of the WounDx tool has led to a 57% reduction in wound closure complication rates for almost half a million patients, highlighting the immediate benefits of AI-powered precision medicine.

SOM research is also addressing fundamental injury challenges. Work funded by the Transforming Technology for the Warfighter program found that the TSN6 peptide mixed in a hydrogel could significantly improve the quality of wound healing, marking a critical advance in battlefield medicine.

High-Stakes Research in Graduate Education

USU’s Graduate Education programs focus on high-stakes research with direct clinical applications.

Students in the Molecular and Cell Biology (MCB) program are investigating deadly diseases, including developing novel therapeutic strategies for human cancers such as pancreatic and lung cancer. Other MCB students are focused on weakening biofilm defenses to enhance antibiotic effectiveness, a vital project for treating warfighters.

Anthony Erb, Megan Rasmussen, and Ambar Rodriguez-Martinez, students working under Dr. Sara Young-Baird, are working to understand how defects in the machinery that controls protein translation in cells causes devastating neurodevelopmental disorders.

Graduate student Joseph LaMorte is working with Dr. Matt Wilkerson to assess correlations between proteomic and transcriptomic tumor profiling in a pan-cancer setting, with broad implications for biomarker identification and advancing cancer precision medicine.

Protecting the Warfighter: Traumatic Injury and Radiation Countermeasures

USU’s specialized centers continue to lead in addressing modern combat injuries, including blast trauma and radiological threats.

Brain Health and Blast Exposure

The Military Traumatic Brain Injury Initiative (MTBI2) program contributed to the newly published second edition of the Brain Trauma Foundation Guidelines for the Management of Penetrating Traumatic Brain Injury. This comprehensive update reflects two decades of medical advances and the realities of modern warfare.

MTBI2 is also focused on preemptive protection. Dr. Michael Roy’s BLAST EMFASIS study, which recently completed enrollment, is among the first to examine the acute effects of blast overpressure exposure in female active-duty Explosive Ordnance Disposal (EOD) personnel. This study uses wearable blast sensors and immediate follow-up assessments to capture critical neurological data.

Radiation Readiness

The Armed Forces Radiobiology Research Institute (AFRRI) is ensuring military personnel can operate in hazardous environments.

The Medical Effects of Ionizing Radiation course, run by AFRRI’s Military Medical Operations department in partnership with Special Operations Command (SOCOM) and the FBI Hostage Rescue Team, aims to develop and validate radiological/nuclear decontamination tactics, techniques, and procedures for open wounds in hot environments. Additionally, AFRRI researchers are working to identify and validate biomarkers for radiation injury, a requirement for Food and Drug Administration approval of medical countermeasures that protect warfighters in radiological/nuclear events.

Educating and Certifying the Military Health Force

USU’s colleges are ensuring the future military medical force is highly trained, professionally credentialed, and ready to deploy.

Advanced Trauma Training

The Graduate School of Nursing (GSN) is elevating the standard for its students. Starting in March 2026, the required “Trauma and Combat Casualty Care” course will be overhauled to culminate in the Tier 4 Tactical Combat Casualty Care (TCCC) certificate for all GSN students. This crucial update ensures Advanced Practice Registered Nurse (APRN) students are prepared for combat operations.

“USU’s role is to ensure the MHS is not

just keeping up, but leading— so our

warfighters receive the most advanced

care anywhere in the world,"" said USU

President Dr. Jonathan Woodson.

In the SOM, the Combat Craniomaxillofacial Trauma Surgery course completed its fifth iteration, including participants from a partner nation for the first time. The course, which provides training critical for treating head and neck trauma in austere environments, will expand in 2026 to pilot a Role 2 course for General Surgeons and Physician Assistants.

Professional Credentials and Graduate Support

The SOM's Preventive Medicine and Biostatistics Department successfully launched the first-of-its-kind Health Informatics and Information Sciences (HIIS) Graduate Certificate Program. This fully asynchronous program is designed to meet the growing military demand for skilled professionals in health informatics and digital transformation.

The College of Allied Health Sciences (CAHS) is focused on aligning academic offerings with professional standards. This includes prioritizing efforts to establish mandatory Hospital Corpsman (HM) certification to provide Navy HMs with nationally-recognized credentials, ensuring validated skills across medical personnel.

The Postgraduate Dental College (PDC) provides essential academic support and resources to more than 400 graduate dental education residents and development opportunities for over 450 military faculty across 55 programs nationwide. The PDC is resuming critical faculty development and outcome assessment survey work that was recently paused, both of which are essential for program accreditation.

Mental Health, Sleep, and Resilience

The Center for Deployment Psychology (CDP) and SOM faculty are collaborating to enhance mental health interventions for service members and their families.

Sleep-Based Suicide Prevention

Dr. Maegan Paxton Willing of CDP is leading foundational research that examines the daily effects of sleep on suicidal ideation in Veterans. This work will inform future large-scale interventions for active-duty service members.

This effort is part of a broader collaboration, including a randomized controlled trial to examine the effectiveness of mHealth apps and group Cognitive Behavioral Therapy for Insomnia (CBT-I) to increase access to evidence-based sleep care within the MHS.

Creative Arts and PTSD

CDP is also facilitating the integration of Creative Arts Therapies (CAT). This includes developing and piloting a novel treatment that integrates Cognitive Behavioral Therapy for Nightmares with art therapy (CBT-N+AT).

Furthermore, Dr. Jeffrey Cook of CDP is examining the clinical effectiveness and acceptability of Behavioral Health Technician-delivered written exposure therapy for Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) in active-duty personnel. This model is specifically designed to improve access to care within the MHS.

The return to full capacity at the Uniformed Services University has immediately translated into accelerated momentum across its core mission areas. From the School of Medicine's deployment of AI to drastically improve wound healing outcomes, to AFRRI’s development of life-saving radiation countermeasures, and the GSN and SOM's commitment to delivering Tier 4 TCCC and specialized trauma training, USU is actively closing critical gaps in military medicine. These efforts are tangible investments in the health, resilience, and readiness of every warfighter, ensuring the MHS remains prepared to support the nation's defense.",https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhKiz1f2Pfib69SxrVyAMkAxq31isUMPm5O_rsoDfRVBeHB0UjRYwuckpYrpklNBDnNxM8YyBtaBcNZ4by2dgnq_J_skLqz0eCvKq2FINOTY3SPYJbtgdDKGtqzp52cLBj52YRgy_kdUzqVNTDIGwIlb9KNUjrCdB3AAtUVVr5zs0j9f60D9FaehjHZ1UQ/w1200-h630-p-k-no-nu/240422-D-ZZ999-010_CampusExteriors.jpg,N,0.0,2025-11-19 13:57:16.192188

Puerto Rico Federal Affairs Administration Executive Director Gabriella Boffelli on Tuesday emphasized the strong collaboration between Gov. Jenniffer González Colón and Resident Commissioner Pablo José Hernández Rivera in successfully advancing House Resolution (HR) 6031, the Medicare Advantage Integrity Act, in the U.S. Congress.

The achievement, she said, was made possible through bipartisan support and aims to further a congressional agenda that benefits the people of Puerto Rico.

“The [resident] Commissioner has acknowledged the positive initiatives spearheaded by the governor during her congressional tenure and has continued to advocate for the benefit of the people,” said Boffelli, who served as González Colón’s chief of staff during her time as resident commissioner. “We are committed to working together to ensure that these important measures progress through the federal legislative process.”

One of the key measures introduced by Hernández Rivera is HR 2632, the TRICARE Equality Act. The initiative, originally proposed by former Gov. Pedro Pierluisi Urrutia during his time as resident commissioner, seeks to expand TRICARE Prime health benefits to military personnel, veterans and their families in Puerto Rico. While serving as resident commissioner, González Colón successfully advocated for an amendment in the Fiscal Year 2019 National Defense Authorization Act that requested that the Department of Defense gather crucial data needed to extend TRICARE Prime health care benefits to the island, ensuring that retired military personnel and their families receive equal support to those in the states. The effort has established a solid foundation for advancing the bill in subsequent years.

Additionally, the resident commissioner has introduced three other measures that were originally championed by González Colón during her congressional term:

1. HR 1696, the Puerto Rico Low-Income Housing Support Act, aims to revise the U.S. Housing Act of 1937 to redefine the extremely low-income category, thereby increasing eligibility for federal housing programs. Doing so will ensure that Puerto Rico adheres to the same low-income standards as the rest of the United States. The reintroduction of the measure reinforces the governor’s ongoing advocacy in Congress for broader access to federal housing programs in Puerto Rico, addressing the housing shortage and the need for more affordable and accessible options for low-income families. As governor, González Colón remains dedicated to initiatives focused on affordable housing and homeownership, Boffelli noted.

2. HR 5168, the Puerto Rico Nutrition Assistance Fairness Act, aims to transition the Nutritional Assistance Program, known locally as PAN by its acronym in Spanish, to the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, widely known as SNAP. This transition is designed to provide greater benefits for food assistance recipients and enhance economic activity, aligning Puerto Rico with the states, Washington, D.C., the U.S. Virgin Islands and Guam. With more than 200 organizations endorsing the measure, which has garnered bipartisan support, Boffelli pointed out, the governor continues to advocate for this transition in Congress, ensuring Puerto Rico is prepared for it.

3. HR 6031, the Medicare Advantage Integrity Act of 2025, seeks to increase Medicare Advantage payments and eliminate disparities in provider payments, ultimately improving healthcare for more than 670,000 beneficiaries of the program on the island. On Nov. 10, the governor reached out to U.S. Health and Human Services Secretary Robert Kennedy Jr. and Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) Administrator Mehmet Oz, urging them to provide stronger support for the Medicare Advantage program for Puerto Rico’s seniors. She has also engaged with CMS to advocate for necessary administrative adjustments that reflect the medical cost realities in the U.S. territory and address the urgent need to retain specialists and healthcare providers.","https://static.wixstatic.com/media/a793f9_1f9d086892794d04b9df6d7a587c290c~mv2.jpg/v1/fill/w_1000,h_792,al_c,q_85,usm_0.66_1.00_0.01/a793f9_1f9d086892794d04b9df6d7a587c290c~mv2.jpg",N,0.0,2025-11-19 01:56:19.317696

Our military families have stepped up and sacrificed for us, now we need to do right by them.” Military families and retirees can face complex healthcare transitions that can cause confusion and unexpected costs.
Families may purchase TRICARE Young Adult (TYA) coverage until age 26, but premiums exceed $570/month for TYA Prime and $300/month for TYA Select.
The TRICARE Transition Transparency Act will: * Require the DoD to notify TRICARE beneficiaries one year, 180 days, and 30 days before a coverage change takes effect.","The bipartisan TRICARE Transition Transparency Act - which would ensure military families are given advanced notice before changes to their coverage go into effect - was recently introduced in the U.S. House of Representatives by Pat Ryan (D-NY) and Jen Kiggans (R-VA). If passed, the bill would require the Department of Defense (DoD) to give TRICARE beneficiaries clear, repeated notices when their coverage is about to change, giving them time to plan, budget, and make informed choices.

An Iraq War veteran, Ryan is member of the House Armed Services Committee, and is also the first West Point graduate to represent the Academy in Congress.

“Military families have sacrificed so much for this country – it’s absolutely unacceptable that their coverage can be ripped away without notice. It’s entirely un- American,” Ryan said. “Especially amid rising health care costs in the Hudson Valley and nationwide, we have to be all-hands-on-deck to deliver much-needed relief to military families across the country. Our military families have stepped up and sacrificed for us, now we need to do right by them.”

Military families and retirees can face complex healthcare transitions that can cause confusion and unexpected costs. Under current rules, dependent children lose regular TRICARE eligibility at age 21 (or 23 if enrolled in school). Families may purchase TRICARE Young Adult (TYA) coverage until age 26, but premiums exceed $570/month for TYA Prime and $300/month for TYA Select. At age 65, beneficiaries must enroll in Medicare Part B to maintain TRICARE for Life coverage, a requirement many retirees learn about too late, which can lead to missed enrollment windows, coverage gaps, and higher out-of-pocket expenses. This bill is designed to ensure beneficiaries receive timely, repeated notifications and clear guidance, allowing them to plan ahead, avoid coverage gaps, and manage costs Ryan stated.

The TRICARE Transition Transparency Act will:

* Require the DoD to notify TRICARE beneficiaries one year, 180 days, and 30 days before a coverage change takes effect.

The study, published in JAMA Network Open, provides hopeful data following a grim period where veteran suicide rates—particularly among those with a traumatic brain injury (TBI)—far outpaced the general population.

“When we started looking at this earlier, there was actually a protective effect for being a veteran. It was called the ‘Healthy Warrior Effect,'” said principal investigator Mary Jo Pugh, a professor of epidemiology at the University of Utah’s Spencer Fox Eccles School of Medicine.

This protective effect, however, reversed as the War on Terror continued.

“Our earlier work showed that around 2006 is when veteran rates of suicide… started to increase,” Pugh noted. “That’s after a period of people being deployed to wars repeatedly since 2001 or 2002. But it’s not just deployment because those who deployed had lower rates of suicide—it is a complex issue.”

The disparity quantified by Pugh’s study is stark: While U.S. adult suicide rates reached about 20 deaths per 100,000 people by 2020, the rate for post-9/11 veterans with TBI peaked at 100 deaths per 100,000, and 61 per 100,000 for those without TBI. According to the Veterans Administration, more than 140,000 veterans have died by suicide since 2001.

A welcome reversal in suicide rates

The study’s most important finding is that veteran suicide rates have dropped sharply since 2020. Pugh suggests this may be due to a “critical mass” of suicide prevention measures, such as the Prevention 2.0 Initiative, the Suicide Prevention Now initiative and the President’s Roadmap to Empower Veterans.

“There’s been a huge emphasis on safe gun use, like providing veterans locks for their guns, which may have an impact,” Pugh said, noting that most veteran suicides involve firearms.

However, she believes it’s a combination of factors. “They’ve got a variety of different approaches to help people… reduce impulsive behavior,” she added. “One size never fits all for any kind of mental health condition or treatment.”

Pugh, a former Air Force nurse, brings a personal perspective to the research. She was medically retired after suffering polytrauma injuries (including TBI) in a bicycle collision with a car piloted by a drunk driver. She went on to earn a doctorate in developmental psychology, which she has used to examine long-term outcomes of military experiences such as TBI.

Eight years ago, she brought her research group, TORCH (Trajectories of Resilience, Community and Health), to the University of Utah. Pugh’s team developed a cohort of all service members and veterans who served on active duty after 9/11 for three or more years (>2.5 million) to conduct population-based analyses of outcomes associated with TBI and other exposures.

Other long-term health outcomes

The group’s recent work on TBI has earned Pugh the Outstanding Research Accomplishment award at the 2025 Military Health System Research Symposium for its groundbreaking research on the long-term outcomes of TBI. That research demonstrates that the consequences of TBI—which affects about one in five post-9/11 veterans—go far beyond suicide risk. Her team found TBI is also linked to other long-term health consequences, including dementia, substance use disorder and even cardiovascular disease.

“Documenting these patterns of risk is a crucial step toward implementing preemptive interventions to help veterans stay healthy,” Pugh said.

TORCH and its affiliated scientists have published numerous studies linking various health outcomes and TBI in veterans, with more studies in the pipeline. Another recent study documents elevated risk for cancers of the central nervous system (CNS), such as glioblastoma, for female veterans with TBI.

This paper examined data covering 422,715 female veterans with 1,229 cancer deaths from 2002 to 2020. “The mortality rate ratio was much higher, almost six times higher than the general population,” she said. The finding is in line with other studies that found elevated CNS cancer risk for those with brain injuries, even among civilians. What might increase the risk for service members and veterans is the inflammation associated with TBI and environmental exposures, including burn pits, occurring alongside the head injury.

“If you have a more severe injury where there’s a blood-brain barrier breach—and even now we find that even with mild TBI, sometimes there’s a blood-brain barrier breach— and if your injury occurs in a situation where there might be fire or flames, even a car accident, that might get into the brain and increase the likelihood of having an exposure that’s synergistic with the TBI,” Pugh explained.

Both these studies appear in JAMA Network Open. The one titled, “Suicide Rate Trends for Post–September 11, 2001, US Military Veterans,” was published Sept. 3, listing Jeffrey Howard of the University of Texas, San Antonio, as first author. The second study, titled “Cancer Mortality Rates in Female Veterans With and Without TBI,” was published March 13, listing Christin DeStefano of the Walter Reed National Military Medical Center as first author. Funding was provided by the Department of Defense and the Department of Veterans Affairs.

A recent agreement between the White House and two drug manufacturers to reduce the cost of some GLP-1 medications does not seem to include those filling prescriptions via the TRICARE pharmacy program, but it could bring more attention to MOAA’s work on behalf of TRICARE For Life patients who lost GLP-1 coverage earlier this year.

MOAA is engaging with Defense Health Agency officials and lawmakers on this issue, stressing that:

Creating separate pharmacy coverage tiers for TRICARE and TRICARE For Life beneficiaries sets a dangerous precedent, one that could weaken the medical benefit moving forward.

TRICARE coverage of GLP-1 medications tied to weight loss has never been for cosmetic purposes. All beneficiaries who received authorization had documented comorbid medical conditions.

Beneficiaries who lose coverage, many of whom are on fixed incomes, are facing a difficult choice – they can continue with medication that may have greatly improved their health and overall quality of life, but only if they are willing to risk financial security.

That’s one reason we started #DHAProud Days, so we’d have an opportunity every month to celebrate the DHA workforce.
Our health care workers are under so much stress and that stress impacts the entire team.","As Defense Health Agency Senior Enlisted Leader Air Force Chief Master Sgt. Tanya Y. Johnson departs the role on Nov. 20, 2025, she will leave behind a legacy of dedication to military health care delivery and commitment to the readiness and morale of thousands of health care professionals caring for our nation’s warfighters.

A self-described “military sprout, because you grow where you're planted when you're in the military,” Johnson was born into military medicine — quite literally — at Wilford Hall Ambulatory Surgical Center, Texas, to a U.S. Air Force medic. Following in her father’s footsteps, she joined the U.S. Air Force as an Airman Basic in October 1993. “It was just a matter of when I was going to join,” she said.

While Johnson trained as a laboratorian, she had her sights set on leadership from the start. “I wanted to be a chief so I could take care of my people,” she said. From her ambitious beginnings in the lab to various deployments to championing DHA’s military medical mission — she brought a wealth of experience with her empathetic leadership style and tireless dedication to beneficiaries and the workforce who cares for them.

Johnson sat down with the DHA news team to reflect on her career-long commitment to the Military Health System, helping provide a medically ready force and ready medical force, and advocating for the people who make military medicine possible. “I’ve always wanted to give back,” she said. “The bottom line is nothing matters if the people doing the work aren't taken care of.”

Question: How did you find yourself in the running for the Defense Health Agency Senior Enlisted Leader role?

Johnson: I’ve been lucky. There have been a lot of great senior leaders throughout my career who helped me get where I am today. In 2013, when I was at Joint Base Langley-Eustis, I started hearing about DHA. Keesler Air Force Base was one of the first facilities to go under the authority, direction, and control of DHA and I was pulled up to be the squadron superintendent, helping the facility transition. I saw DHA as an exciting opportunity to keep military medicine moving forward. I went on deployment right after Keesler transitioned, and when I returned and saw that things weren’t moving as fast as I thought they would, I asked questions. I ended up working as senior enlisted leader in DHA administration and management under Dr. Barclay Butler and the rest is history.

Question: How did your deployments with Operation United Assistance, Operation Inherent Resolve, and Operation Deliberate Resolve shape your experience?

Johnson: On deployment you’re often going into an unknown situation. To succeed, everyone must work together to support the mission. From a medical perspective, deployments showcase medics at their best. Building a health care facility that’s ready to go within 12 hours of boots on the ground, and then having the privilege of supporting health care workers — is there any more fulfilling mission? Add to that the joint relationships, not just between the services but with our allied partners and seeing how those relationships are reinforced, was incredibly valuable.

Question: Where do you see the biggest opportunities for growth and innovation at DHA over the next several years?

Johnson: Technology is our greatest opportunity. We all know there’s a shortage of health care professionals in this country. We need to find new ways to deliver care to meet our military medical mission. There's so much out there, the things we see at conferences like DHITS (Defense Health Information Technology Symposium) and HIMSS (Healthcare Information and Management Systems Symposium) … I hope DHA can find a way to get that technology into the hands of patients and providers.

Question: What do you see as the biggest challenges facing DHA in coming years and how is DHA preparing to meet those challenges?

Johnson: DHA needs to modernize its infrastructure — everything from computers to the facilities — to continue delivering the best possible care. That means showing the value of investing those dollars. That’s a challenge because money spent on infrastructure is money not spent on something else. There are always going to be competing priorities, and I don't envy the people having those conversations, but we owe it to our patients and staff to find a way to make it happen.

Question: What are you most proud of from your time at DHA?

Johnson: The people. What we do isn’t easy, and I’m proud of the compassion and discipline of our workforce. It’s humbling to work alongside such a dedicated team. I’m also proud of what DHA has accomplished. We’ve made great strides in things like our electronic health record (MHS GENESIS) and network structure. The last few years I’ve noticed a real cohesiveness around our shared vision. It’s been amazing to witness.

Question: What advice would you give your younger self about being a successful leader?

Johnson: To succeed in a joint environment, you need to learn and understand the cultural nuances and terminology of the other services. Those differences matter, especially as a leader. Taking time to learn and use words like shipmate and deck plate when visiting a Navy hospital, for example, show the sailors on board you respect them. Once your people see and feel your respect, it’s easier to pull them together and keep everyone moving in the same direction.

Question: Your catchphrase is “lead with grace.” What does it mean to lead with grace?

Johnson: Leading with grace means practicing compassion and empathy for others, assuming positive intent and acknowledging that everyone is trying their best. Leaders set the tone. If a leader is respectful and understanding, their people will be, too.

Question: You once said DHA’s core values of dependability, humility, and agility are an important part of who we are today and who we want to be in the future. What do DHA’s values mean to you?

Johnson: Patients depend on us to provide the care they deserve, and our staff depend on us for a safe, modern facility to provide that care. We need to be humble enough to hear and understand what our patients and staff tell us they need and then do our best to provide it. Agility means asking ourselves, “Are we changing with the times? Are we delivering at the speed of relevance?” and then finding ways to make change happen.

Question: Celebrating the workforce has been an important part of your role as SEL. How can DHA continue to recognize workforce contributions?

Johnson: We can't do what we do without our people. The DHA workforce is a huge force-enabler. Without our people, the warfighter doesn't go to war, retirees don't get their benefits, TRICARE doesn't provide for its 9.5 million beneficiaries. Our success depends on our workforce, and they should be tremendously proud of what they accomplish each and every day. That’s one reason we started #DHAProud Days, so we’d have an opportunity every month to celebrate the DHA workforce. We also have DHA Spotlights and the quarterly employee recognition awards, but we can always do more to acknowledge the incredible work being done across the agency.

Question: Is there anything you didn’t accomplish as SEL that you wish you’d been able to do?

Johnson: An organizational well-being platform was at the top of my list. Our health care workers are under so much stress and that stress impacts the entire team. We wanted to find a way to support them, to bring the temperature down and give them a chance to take a knee, take a breath, and fill their cup a bit. It was a way of giving back, and I’m hopeful it will launch in the future.

I also hoped to consolidate and optimize enlisted education at the Medical Education and Training Campus to focus on joint courses and shared resources. We have an enlisted working group of SELs looking at how we can consolidate the METC campus and the continuum of enlisted training, from METC to the MTFs (military treatment facilities) and advanced training. My hope is that sometime in the next three to five years you’ll walk into a classroom and see everyone training together.

Question: What surprised you the most about being DHA SEL?

Johson: Just how much was out of our control. So much of what we do is determined by legislation. Before coming to DHA, I’d often wonder why something wasn’t getting done or wasn’t getting done quickly. DHA is a small piece of a larger bureaucratic system and it's easy to see why that’s frustrating. The system is complex, and while we do everything we can to set the agency up for success — that often means making tough decisions.

Question: What advice do you have for the next SEL to help them succeed in the role?

Johnson: This job isn’t about what you want, it’s about being responsible and accountable to the agency, our beneficiaries, our workforce — everyone we’re privileged to serve. Stay the course. Trust your team. Get comfortable saying no. Remember that nothing happens without our people. They're the legacy we leave behind.

Question: What’s next after you retire from DHA?

Johnson: Finding a way to give back to the communities and people who supported me all these years. I believe in DHA and the MHS and I want to continue supporting the health care professionals doing the hard work, day in and day out.

Question: What message would you like to leave for the DHA workforce?

Johnson: Thank you for trusting me and thank you for continuing to take care of our beneficiaries and each other. It has been an honor to be part of your team and a true privilege to support you, advocate for you, and cheer your many, many successes. I hope you know how much I care about each of you.",https://d1ldvf68ux039x.cloudfront.net/thumbs/photos/2511/9392001/1000w_q95.jpg,N,0.0,2025-11-18 18:56:40.161524
