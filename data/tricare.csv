TRICARE beneficiaries in Alexander, Alleghany, Ashe, Avery, Buncombe, Burke, Cabarrus, Caldwell, Catawba, Cherokee, Clay, Cleveland, Gaston, Graham, Haywood, Henderson, Iredell, Jackson, Lincoln, Macon, Madison, McDowell, Mecklenburg, Mitchell, Rowan, Rutherford, Stanly, Swain, Transylvania, Union, Watauga, Wilkes, and Yancey counties are now eligible to receive emergency prescription refills through April 6, 2025.

For beneficiaries in Polk County, the date has been extended from April 2, 2025, to April 6, 2025.

To receive an emergency refill of prescription medications, TRICARE beneficiaries should take their prescription bottle to any TRICARE retail network pharmacy. If the bottle is unavailable or the label is damaged or missing, beneficiaries should contact Express Scripts, Inc., or their retail network pharmacy for assistance.

To find a network pharmacy, beneficiaries may call Express Scripts at 1-877-363-1303, or search the network pharmacy locator.

If possible, visit the pharmacy where the prescription was filled. Prescriptions filled by a retail chain may be filled at another store in that chain. If the clinician who prescribed the medication is available, beneficiaries can ask them to call in a new prescription to any network pharmacy.

As a reminder, TRICARE beneficiaries, other than active duty service members, may receive urgent care from any TRICARE-authorized urgent care center or provider and do not need a referral. This allows beneficiaries to seek nonemergency care for illnesses or injuries if their primary care provider is unavailable because of emergencies. Any TRICARE beneficiary who reasonably believes they have an emergency should always call 911 or, go to the nearest emergency room.

Beneficiaries are advised to visit Express Scripts’ Weather Notices page for updates.

• The referral approval waiver has been extended from March 31 to April 30.

• The point of service waiver has been extended from March 31 to April 30.

• The deadline to provide payment information to TriWest Healthcare Alliance, the new West Region contractor, has been extended to April 30.

The referral approval waiver allows TRICARE Prime beneficiaries to see TRICARE-authorized specialty providers for outpatient care without getting primary care manager (PCM) referrals approved by TriWest. However, beneficiaries still need their PCMs to provide referrals before getting specialty care.

This process is retroactive to Jan. 1.

TRICARE Prime beneficiaries may seek outpatient care from any TRICARE-authorized specialty provider with the following documentation:

• A copy of the referral dated Jan. 1-April 30.

• A copy of the TRICARE West Region Referral/Authorization Waiver Approval Letter, available on tricare.mil/west.

TRICARE Prime beneficiaries may see both network and non-network TRICARE-authorized providers during this waiver period. TRICARE Prime beneficiaries should ask the provider if they’re TRICARE-authorized.

The referral approval waiver does not apply to:

• Inpatient care

• Applied behavior analysis or Autism Care Demonstration services

• Laboratory developed tests

• Extended Care Health Option services

If beneficiaries need any of these services, TriWest will still need to approve their referral before they see a specialist.

The point of service waiver allows beneficiaries to continue seeing providers who may no longer be in network. However, providers MUST be TRICARE-authorized. This means they’re:

• Licensed by a state, accredited by national organization, or meet other standards of the medical community

• Certified to provide benefits under TRICARE

Beneficiaries using the point of service waiver will pay TRICARE Prime copayments.

Finally, beneficiaries enrolled in a TRICARE premium-based plan (TRICARE Young Adult, TRICARE Reserve Select, and TRICARE Retired Reserve) now have until April 30 to provide payment information to TriWest.

If beneficiaries have TRICARE Prime or TRICARE Select, they also have until April 30 to pay their fees.

If they don’t act before these dates, they’ll be disenrolled, retroactive to Jan. 1.

MEADE, Md.– Fort Meade Emergency Medical Services hosted the National Association of Emergency Medical Technicians Tactical Emergency Casualty Care training March 20-21. The training presented EMS providers with concepts, principles, and skills to deliver emergency medical care for patients in a civilian tactical environment.

The two-day specialized course drew EMS personnel from Fort Meade and the surrounding jurisdictions of Anne Arundel, Howard, and Baltimore Counties.

“The course not only reinforces crucial trauma care techniques but also ensures that local providers are equipped with the most up-to-date methods to improve patient outcomes in critical situations,” said Carrie A. Krest, Chief of Fort Meade Emergency Medical Services.

Major course topics instructed by the Maryland Fire & Rescue Institute focused on rapid trauma assessment, stabilization, and decision-making in the field that included hemorrhage control; surgical airway procedures and needle decompression; strategies for treating wounded responders in threatening environments, and techniques for dragging and carrying victims to safety. Topics ensured that attendees are prepared to deliver the best medical care possible before patients reach the hospital. Methods of instruction included lecture, discussion, hands-on skills stations and team-focused practical exercises.

“By hosting the training, Fort Meade EMS reaffirms its commitment to maintaining high standards of emergency care for both the base and the surrounding community,” Krest said.

The TECC training provides evidence-based and best practice trauma care that integrates nomenclature familiar to civilian EMS, fire, and law enforcement. The training plays a critical role in enhancing the skills necessary to providing care outside normal operating conditions of most EMS agencies, such as responding to a mass casualty or active shooter event.

“The course is a reminder of the importance of ongoing professional development in the ever-evolving field of emergency medicine,” Krest said.",https://d1ldvf68ux039x.cloudfront.net/thumbs/photos/2503/8939221/1000w_q95.jpg,N,0.0,2025-03-27 14:56:15.703595

We implemented dependent care flexible spending accounts last year, and this year is the first year for health care flexible spending accounts.
It’s not just traditional health care costs that are covered under HCFSA, but there are also vision care and dental care costs that are considered eligible expenses under HCFSAs.
An HCFSA is a benefit, it’s an optional benefit, that allows service members to set aside pretax earnings to pay for eligible health care, dental care, and vision care expenses.
Ronald Garner: What I’m encouraging any service member, whether they are a single service member or a service member with a family, a service member with an exceptional family member, any service member, what I’m encouraging them to do is to take a look at the benefits available through a health care flexible spending account.","Ronald Garner: I really appreciate the opportunity to talk to you and your listeners about health care flexible spending accounts. I am a retired service member myself and I think about how beneficial this program would have been to my family while we were on active duty.

Tom Temin: I should have known this. This is the first year they’ve had this available.

Ronald Garner: For uniformed service members, this is the first year that health care flexible spending accounts are available. We implemented dependent care flexible spending accounts last year, and this year is the first year for health care flexible spending accounts. So it’s an unusual year in that the enrollment period for this year is from March 3rd to March 31st, which means, of course, we’re right in the middle of the enrollment period right now. But the standard enrollment period for service members will be the normal federal benefits open season from mid-November to mid-December each year. And that will start in mid-November of 2025, so mid-November of this year for the next plan.

Tom Temin: So if they missed this one that’s about to close on us, they can do it later in this year. And if something comes up in their life that they could use this money, there’s an option for some other type of sign-up mechanism?

Ronald Garner: Yeah, there absolutely is Tom. Like many programs of this nature, there are options to sign up based upon qualifying life events. In qualifying life events, with respect to HCFSAs, you might think of things that constitute significant changes to your employment. So for a service member that might be a PCS, right? Or something of that nature or deployment. Say you’re a single service member and you deploy, and it becomes obvious to you that you’re not going to be able to utilize a lot of the funds that you would be putting into an HCFSA. That would be a qualifying life event that would allow you to stop sending funds to your HCFSA.

Tom Temin: And I guess I was under the impression that if you are in uniform as a service member, pretty much all of your health care requirements are taken care of by virtue of you being in uniform. But that’s apparently not the case.

Ronald Garner: That’s a good point there, Tom. There are a lot of things that no health insurance system or no health care system is going to cover, particularly if you’re talking about not just service members, but their families, right? So if you are a service member in uniform, certainly the coverage for you is very comprehensive under TRICARE. And for families, it is much more comprehensive under TRICARE than the vast majority of health insurance programs. But there are always going to be expenses that aren’t covered by health insurance or that are just unexpected expenses that you incur in the spur of the moment, right? So for instance, if you have a kid and your kid gets sick in one day, in the middle of the day, in the middle of the night, you’re probably not going to wait until you can get into a health care facility to take your child in if they’ve got a cold or something like that. You’re going to go buy some cold medicine at the local pharmacy and those kinds of over-the-counter medications would be covered under an HCFSA.

Tom Temin: If that child say something near and dear to my heart would need, say, glasses.

Ronald Garner: And that’s an important point, right? It’s not just traditional health care costs that are covered under HCFSA, but there are also vision care and dental care costs that are considered eligible expenses under HCFSAs. One that was near and dear to my heart when I was an active-duty member was the cost of braces for my daughter. TRICARE Dental doesn’t cover the entire cost of that. And as any parent who has had a teenager knows, those costs can be pretty significant.

Tom Temin: Yeah, I’ve put a few on in my own life for kids over the years. We’re speaking with Ron Garner. He’s the assistant director for military compensation policy at the Defense Department. And just give us some of the details here. How large can the accounts be and what does it take to withdraw? What are some of the mechanics here?

Ronald Garner: Sure, I would like to just first start off by saying what an HCFSA is. An HCFSA is a benefit, it’s an optional benefit, that allows service members to set aside pretax earnings to pay for eligible health care, dental care, and vision care expenses. Obviously, one of the primary benefits of this program is that you can pay for those expenses while reducing your taxable income, right? So I think that this is going to be of great service to military families, particularly military families that potentially fall within that exceptional family member program community. Now, as to how much you can set aside each year, each member is eligible to set aside between $100 and $3,300 in a year. If you have two eligible family members, so if you and your spouse are both eligible, you can, through your employer, and it’s not just military service members who have access to HCFSAs, federal civilians have access to them, many private sector employees have access too them as well. So if you or your spouse is both eligible and you maintain separate accounts, you can set aside up to $6,600 in a year.

Tom Temin: All right, and then this is just in an account and do you have a card that goes with it? Some kind of a debit card or how does it work?

Ronald Garner: No, you don’t. There’s no debit card. So the way that it works is that the service member signs up for the HCFSA through FSAFEDS.gov. They indicate how much they want to set aside in the plan. You’re up to the $3,300 limit and then they go out and they incur expenses the way that they normally would, right? So to use our example from earlier, you’re going to get braces for your child. You would go out and incur that expense you would pay for it. And then you would take your receipt or your statement of services or whatever you get from the provider. You would upload that to FSAFEDS. And FSAFEDS would reimburse you for all of those eligible expenses from the money that you have contributed. Now, there’s an important point here, I think, to make, which is that when you contribute, you’re going to contribute a certain amount each month. Let’s say that you elect to contribute the full $3,300 in a year and you’re going to do that in $330 increments across 10 months. So even though you haven’t contributed that entire amount at any point in the year until the end of the year, the entire amount of that $3,300 is available to you immediately after you enroll, right? So if you incur $3,300 worth of expenses a week after you enroll, and you haven’t contributed more than let’s say $330, you’re still going to be able to get reimbursed for that full $3,300 and it will just continue to be withdrawn from your pay each month.

Tom Temin: And I have a bigger question on this. We’ve talked about benefits for, say, children of service members. That seems to be the model that this is patterned for. That is to say, there’s very little that the service member, him or herself, would need this account for, given the comprehensive coverage of TRICARE. This seems to be a family-oriented or partner/spouse-oriented program to begin with. Am I correct in that?

Ronald Garner: I think it is appropriate to say that the members who are most likely to benefit from this are members with families, that military families are more likely to benefit from it than service members who don’t have families. Now, that isn’t to say that there aren’t benefits to this program to service members. There are certain things that you just can’t cover with a health insurance program, even when it’s comprehensive. As TRICARE, the best example of that is unexpected expenses. Anything that a service member can plan for themselves individually, many things that they can plan for, they’re going to be able to get taken care of through a military treatment facility. But there are a lot of unexpected costs that they’re not going to be able to get taken care of through a military treatment facility. And so there are some benefits to certainly to single service members. I think the greatest benefits are going be to those service members with families.

Tom Temin: Are you encouraging single service members to take an account anyhow?

Ronald Garner: What I’m encouraging any service member, whether they are a single service member or a service member with a family, a service member with an exceptional family member, any service member, what I’m encouraging them to do is to take a look at the benefits available through a health care flexible spending account. And there’s plenty of information out there about it. They can do it. They can find information via FSAFEDS.gov. We’ve put out a ton of information on the DoD Financial Readiness website. There’s an FSA page on the DoD Financial Readiness website and there’s just a wealth of information out there. I’m encouraging them to get all of the information they can and make a determination about whether an HCFSA is the right answer for themselves and or their family.

Tom Temin: Somewhere there’s a list of things that TRICARE doesn’t cover and then there’s also a list of things the health spending account does cover and that’s what you’re looking for.",https://federalnewsnetwork.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/ThinkstockPhotos-509111008-e1743092040838.jpg,N,0.0,2025-03-27 12:56:19.166347

Col. Keithbarry Garcia, the officer-in-charge of the Brussels Health Clinic; Lt. Col. Everett Zachary, the garrison chaplain; Dr. Oliver Freeman, director of Human Resources and Lt. Col. Reginald Moise, the director of Emergency Services, hosted a town hall March 20, 2025 at the Brussels Unit School at Sterrebeek Annex.

The hybrid town hall permitted garrison leaders and community members to come together both in person and online to share information and answer questions about support and services provided to the Brussels military community.

Community Update- Jeffrey Gliedman, interim Brussels deputy garrison manager

Gliedman welcomed town hall attendees and thanked them on behalf of Col. Patrick Hofmann, the garrison commander, for attending in person and online. He then gave a brief update regarding garrison operations in Brussels.

Gliedman started by saying that despite recent changes in the U.S. government and personnel actions at some agencies of the federal workforce, there have been no significant changes in the services provided in Brussels and no garrison jobs have been lost to personnel reductions.

Gliedman explained that there is currently a hiring freeze which impacts the garrison and a number of positions have not been filled and the garrison is seeking exceptions to policy to try and onboard personnel. One position that was filled is a member of the 266th Financial Management Center, who has arrived to assist Army military members with pay issues.

For Brussels consolidation efforts on Brussels main, Gliedman provided the following updates:

The plan for moving the Brussels gym from Building 3 into the site of the old 3 Star Recreation Center is expected in May, but it may slip to June.

The gym will not close until it’s ready to move, so it is still open at the current location with 24-hour access. When it’s time for the gym to move it will probably be closed for two or three days.

Personnel who work in Building 3, will move to Building 2 or Building 4 as planned in May. The exact date has not been determined.

Gliedman said that when it comes to future plans for the Brussels consolidation and move from Brussels Main to Sterrebeek Annex, the plan is still dependent on funding. If the funding is not approved, then garrison staff will stay at Brussels Main and leadership will continue to request funds and revise plans accordingly.

Gliedman also outlined future construction at the Brussels Unit School on Sterrebeek Annex that will take place from 2026 to 2029 and said garrison leaders are coordinating with Army Corps of Engineers to ensure construction is done smartly, safely and with minimal impact to students.

Some upcoming Brussels events are:

April 25: Brussels Annual Volunteer Recognition Ceremony, 1 p.m. at the Community Conference Room, Brussels Main.

April 26: Brussels Consignment Shop Flea Market- 9 a.m. to 1 p.m., open to all U.S. and NATO ID cardholders.

May 3: Daddy-Daughter dance hosted by the American Legion in Building 2 Community Conference Room, Brussels Main.

Col. Everett Zachary- Religious Services

Zachary gave an overview of past and present religious support provided to the Brussels community and acknowledged that COVID-19 had a significant impact on religious services across the Benelux. Since the pandemic, the number of people seeking religious services in Brussels dropped dramatically and around a year ago it was decided to sunset Protestant services in Brussels and continue with Catholic services only. Zachary said they will continue to monitor requests for support to see if there is a need for additional services.

Zachary highlighted the following religious services that are provided by volunteers in the Community Conference Room in Bldg. 2 of Brussels Main:

Monday - Coffee Moms at 10:30 a.m. and Middle School Bible Study at 5 p.m.

Wednesday - New Moms Group at 10 a.m. and Youth Bible Study at 5 p.m.

Thursday - Adult Bible Study at 7 p.m.

Friday - Women's Bible Study at 10 a.m. and Food for Life Bible Study 11:30 a.m. (1st and 3rd Sundays)

Zachary said the Chaplain Corps is short of chaplains, but there is the option of utilizing a volunteer Designated Faith Group leader to provide additional religious support for Brussels. A qualified Brussels community member is in the process of becoming a designated Faith group leader and in the next weeks additional religious services are planned for the Brussels Community Conference Room. Zachary explained that the volunteer leader would be the lead pastor for Brussels with oversight by the chaplains at Chièvres Air Base.

Zachary ended his remarks by telling the Brussels community that support from the Catholic priest at SHAPE is available by request and that information about Chapel services and special services during the holidays is available at https://home.army.mil/benelux/about/Garrison/religious-support and on the garrison’s social media pages.

Stacy Perez, FMWR

Before highlighting some upcoming events, Perez encouraged the community follow the garrison’s Facebook, Instagram, Linked-In social media pages and use the U.S. Army Garrison Benelux website to find information about all the activities provided by FMWR.

Perez stressed the need for additional volunteer coaches and explained FMWR can offer more activities for the Brussels community if more volunteer coaches become available. She also highlighted that Army Community Services can register people to become a volunteers and can also assist with training for those who are new to coaching.

Perez also discussed the Interactive Customer Evaluation system (ICE) and encouraged community members to provide feedback about FMWR services. She also suggested that people provide their contact details when using ICE so garrison leaders can reach out for additional information.

Perez highlighted the following upcoming FMWR events:

April 11 - CYS Purple Up Run

April 19 - Eggstravaganza egg hunt and games from 1 p.m. to 3 p.m.

April 26 - Mommy and Daddy 101, 12 p.m. at Army Community Services

Lt. Col. Keith Garcia, Brussels Health Clinic

Garcia spoke about staffing challenges and the proactive steps the Brussels Health Clinic is taking to navigate those challenges. With the hiring freeze, there will be more shortages due to staff turnover and hiring delays. However, a new radiologist and medic are expected in May and the clinic is coordinating with the SHAPE Healthcare Facility and Landstuhl Regional Medical Center to receive nursing support on a rotational basis. Clinic staff are also working to optimize medical appointment time slots and ensure all slots are utilized effectively with no lost appointments.

To ensure timely care, Garcia advised patients schedule appointments in advance for essential services such as routine blood pressure checks and pregnancy tests. He also recommended for parents to schedule annual child physicals early in the months of April and May.

Regarding the Brussels Dental Clinic, Garcia said there will be reduction of operations due to permanent change of station of the only dentist assigned to the clinic. Beginning April 1st, dental clinic operations will be reduced to two days a week for dental readiness and space available care will no longer be scheduled. Dental cleanings and routine dental care such as fillings, crowns and extractions need to be scheduled at the Shape Dental Clinic due to space limitations.

Garcia also provided the following updates regarding clinic operations and network care:

Physical Health Assessment rodeos for active-duty members will be held April 7th and 18th. For more information and updates about clinic hours and services visit the Brussels Happenings web page at https://home.army.mil/benelux/my-fort/happenings/brussels.

The clinic continues to coordinate with network providers to receive healthcare records in a timely manner, but requests must go through International SOS can take up to a month.

Patients can proactively assist with their healthcare by retrieving their own medical records through the Mynexushealth portal. This portal will give patients access to their medical records from Belgian providers and give the option to share records access with the medical team at the Brussels health Clinic. For more information about the portal and mobile app visit https://www.nexuzhealth.com/en/patients.

For more assistance with the Mynexushealth portal or questions about network healthcare contact the Brussels clinic patient liaison at michael.g.vandriessche.ln@health.mil or audrey.m.geldhof.ln@health.mil.

The medical center in Wezembeek-Oppem no longer accepts Tricare Prime patients for routine care. However, Tricare Prime members can still go to the medical center’s emergency room to receive urgent care treatment.

The Brussels Health Clinic cannot provide urgent care. Community members worried about loss of limb, eyesight or life should call 112 or visit the nearest emergency room. For Tricare Prime beneficiaries, it is recommended to notify the health clinic of any emergency room visits as soon as possible before bills are received for care.

Personnel arriving and departing the Brussels community are reminded to in-process and out-process with the Tricare Service Center. Failure to properly in-process or out-process can lead to gaps in healthcare coverage.

The clinic is working with Tricare and International SOS to provide patients with information updates about appointments made with host nation network providers. Please ensure the clinic has your correct e-mail address.

The clinic seeks patient cooperation to prevent missed appointments, which impacts availability of care for other patients and can incur additional costs. Some network providers charge up to 600 Euros for missed appointments with charges going to a collection agency. If patients cannot make an appointment with a network provider, they should contact the Brussels Health Clinic to reschedule.

Garcia emphasized that clinic staff stand ready to serve the needs of the Brussels community and encouraged members to contact the clinic for healthcare questions or to provide feedback.

Dr. Oliver Freeman, Human Resources

Freeman explained that the hiring freeze has impacted the garrison’s ability to fill the Brussels position for passport services, so personnel from Brunssum and SHAPE are helping to provide support for Brussels services. Freeman also encouraged community members to use ICE comments to give garrison leaders feedback, positive or negative.

Collette Tate, Brussels Unit School

Tate said that the school is not impacted by the hiring freeze and they will have a full staff for the start of the new school year in August.

Shawn Ticho, Child and Youth Services

Ticho reminded community members that April is Month of the Military Child and encouraged everyone to wear purple on Fridays throughout April to recognize military children.

Ticho also highlighted the following CYS events for April:

April 9 - Purple Up at the Brussels Unit School. Community members will meet at the school at 7:45 a.m. to welcome students.

April 25 to 26 - Operation Megaphone- Brussels youths will stay on Brussels Main overnight and meet online with other youths from CYS programs worldwide to discuss key issues affecting military children.

Kristin Savage, Public Affairs

Savage provided an update that Make-A-Wish is happening on SHAPE from 4 p.m. June 6 to 4 p.m. June 7 for 24 hours of fun activities for kids and food from the different nations at SHAPE. For more information visit https://www.facebook.com/USECOonSHAPE/

Town Hall Questions and Answers

Q1. What is the update regarding the creation of a community room that we can use in place of the 3 Star Recreation Facility?

A1. The garrison, together with the Department of Defense Activity (DODEA) Europe West District office, has recently opened a conference room here on Sterrebeek Annex. We will confirm the procedures for requesting use of the room with DODEA and inform the community through the public affairs office.

Q2. Are ACS resources available for civilian employees?

A2. Yes, absolutely!

Q3. How long are CYS medical physicals valid?

A3. Medical physicals for CYS sports are valid one year. CYS care physicals are valid for three years.

Q4. Are medical records from UZ Leuven automatically transferred to MHS Genesis?

Q5. Will the garrison support the 4th of July this year?

A5. Yes, the Benelux will partner with the SHAPE Base Support Group for the July 4th celebration at SHAPE starting at 3 p.m. and ending with fireworks. The garrison will also celebrate Independence Day in Brunssum as well.

On June 4, 2024, medical journal STAT published a report on Zynex entitled “How a device maker inundated pain patients with unwanted batteries and surprise bills.” The report claimed Zynex engaged in an “oversupplying scheme” by sending inordinate amounts of monthly supplies like electrode pads and batteries in order to “bill insurers for thousands of dollars more than it otherwise could.” The report further revealed that, as a result of this practice, insurers were “kicking the company out of network.”

On this news, Zynex’s stock price fell $0.50 per share, or 5%, to close at $9.35 per share on June 4, 2024.

Then, on March 11, 2025, Zynex reported its fourth quarter and full year 2024 financial results, revealing a revenue “shortfall” in the quarter “due to slower than normal payments from certain payers.” Zynex also revealed that Tricare, the healthcare program for uniformed service members that “currently represents approximately 20-25% of [the Company's] annual revenue”, “has temporarily suspended payments as they review prior claims.”

On this news, Zynex’s stock price fell $3.59 per share, or 51.3%, to close at $3.41 per share on March 12, 2025.

James Kinnaird, a flight nurse with the 911th Aeromedical Evacuation Squadron, steadied himself on the open door. Just days ago, he had practiced rappelling in the quiet of a classroom, but now, the deafening roar of rotor blades and the violent vibrations of the aircraft made every movement a challenge.

With one deep breath, he clipped in and stepped off, descending rapidly to the open field below—one step closer to earning his Air Assault wings.

Kinnaird was the sole Citizen Airman who attended the Air Assault course in the U.S. Army’s Sabalauski Air Assault School at Fort Campbell, Kentucky, from Aug. 13-28, 2024. The rigorous nine-day program trains service members in helicopter-based operations, including air assault tactics, sling-load operations, and rappelling. Upon graduation, each Soldier—or Airman—can execute critical skills to maximize the use of helicopter assets in both training and combat environments to support unit operations.

The course covers a wide scope of rotary-wing aircraft operations, including aircraft safety, aeromedical evacuation procedures, pathfinder operations, combat assault techniques, and the execution of sling-load and rappelling techniques. Instruction is conducted in both classroom and field environments, ensuring students are prepared for real-world missions.

A Grueling Start

Earning the Air Assault badge requires extensive preparation, both physically and mentally.

“A typical day involved early morning physical training, followed by classroom sessions, hands-on exercises, and team-building activities,” Staff Sgt. Zachary Adams, a fire team member with the 911th Security Forces Squadron said. “Evenings were often spent reviewing the day’s lessons and preparing for the next.”

Adams, who attended the course a few months after Kinniard, prepared by following a strict 4 a.m. workout routine that included rucking. Kinnaird also focused heavily on rucking, logging about 20 miles each week.

For those considering Air Assault School, Adams emphasized preparation and perseverance. “My advice would be to prepare thoroughly, both mentally and physically,” he said. “Seek mentorship, stay committed, and never underestimate the importance of teamwork and resilience.”

The course officially began with “Day Zero,” a physically demanding introduction designed to weed out unprepared candidates. The day included a gear inspection, known as the ""bag drag,"" to ensure each student had all required equipment, followed by an obstacle course.

“You have a packing list, and you have to have everything. If you don't have it, you’re kicked out,” Kinnaird said. “We lost 10 members on the first day.”

Packing requirements included roughly 50 items, ranging from simple necessities such as extra pairs of socks, earplugs, and gallon-sized Ziploc bags to more specific military gear like “one Modular Lightweight Load-carrying Equipment rucksack (large or medium, complete with a frame, waist belt, and sustainment pouches), and an Improved Outer Tactical Vest or plate carrier with Enhanced Small Arms Protective Inserts plates, Kevlar inserts, with name tape, and rank affixed” according to information from the U.S. Army Air Assault webpage.

The obstacle course consisted of nine challenges designed to test strength, endurance, and confidence at heights. One of the toughest, Kinnaird recalled, was the ""confidence climb""—a 35-foot ladder with widening gaps between rungs as students ascended.

“When I got toward the top, I had to jump to reach the final rung,” he said. Because students were not allowed to use the ladder’s side rails, the challenge forced them to problem-solve while battling any fear of heights.

Sling-Load Stress

After completing the physically demanding opening phase, students moved on to phase two– sling load operations– a critical component of the course that trains students to rig, inspect, and secure external loads for helicopter transport.

“The A-22 sling load deficiency test was especially challenging,” said Adams.

Air Assault hopefuls had to memorize more than 65 possible deficiencies and identify three out of a maximum of four errors to pass, and there are no second chances. Even minor mistakes—such as a misrouted strap, an unsecured snap link, or failing to notice an unbalanced load—could result in failure. The high-stakes nature of the test and the rapid pace of inspections caused significant stress among students.

“The test for the sling load deficiencies really stressed a lot of people out,” said Kinnaird. “You had to inspect four different loads in under two minutes and find the exact discrepancies the instructors set up. “That’s where we lost ... maybe a third, if not a half, of our class.

Mastering sling load operations is crucial, as improperly secured loads can be catastrophic in real-world missions, endangering both personnel and equipment. The training ensured that graduates could confidently conduct aerial resupply, troop transport, and combat sustainment operations under pressure.

Descending to Graduation

The final phase of training focused on rappelling—first from a tower and, ultimately, from a hovering UH-60 Black Hawk.

For both Kinnaird and Adams, the moment they stepped off the helicopter was the highlight of the course.

“You could see the light at the end of the tunnel,” Kinnaird said, recalling the moment he landed in an open field below. But one final challenge remained—the grueling 12-mile ruck march.

Beginning at 4 a.m., students carried 35-pound rucksacks while maintaining a demanding pace. Those who completed the march crossed the finish line just in time for graduation that afternoon.

“Finishing [the ruck] made me realize that all the hard work and sacrifices leading up to the course were completely worth it,” Adams said.

Of the 30 students in Kinnaird’s ruck unit, only about 17 made it to graduation. The others, unable to finish the march, were sent home without earning their wings.

Graduates of the course receive the coveted Air Assault Badge, which is traditionally pinned onto their uniforms by an instructor. But completing Air Assault School is more than just earning a badge—it’s a testament to resilience, teamwork, and the ability to operate in high-stress environments.

For Kinnaird and Adams, the grueling days of physical and mental challenges reinforced their skills and determination. Now, armed with their newly earned expertise, they stand ready to apply their training to real-world missions, ensuring they can support their units with precision and confidence.",https://media.defense.gov/2025/Mar/26/2003676527/2000/2000/0/250302-F-DM010-1013.JPG,N,0.0,2025-03-27 00:56:23.893699

Veteran groups seek volunteers

The Nevada Veterans Coalition, the Patriot Guard Riders and the Northern Nevada All Veteran Honor Guard are seeking new members.

The coalition assists with military funerals at the Northern Nevada Veterans Memorial Cemetery in addition to presenting the colors at other events such as Memorial Day in late May, the Vietnam Veterans Remembrance ceremony in March and the Camos to Classroom scholarship dinner in mid-November.

Coalition members aren’t required to be veterans, but they should be a member who supports the military.

For information, call 775-575-6842 or email info@supportnnvc.org.

Patriot Guard Riders complement the honor guards and their tributes to a fallen comrade or remembrance. Founded in 2005, the PGR not only honors military veterans but also first responders.

The PGR encourages anyone who has a love and respect for veterans and first responders to join the riders. He said many members ride motorcycles as escorts for funerals and different events, but that is not a prerequisite for joining.

Since the PGR is a national organization, volunteers may sign up on the universal website for the organization, patriotguard.org. There’s a button to click for membership information, which is free.

The Northern Nevada All Veteran Honor Guard is sponsored by Carson City’s American Legion High Desert Post 56. The non-profit honor guard presides at services at no cost to the family. The qualifications for belonging to the guard include members who have served in the military and are available on weekdays. The group does not provide services on Sundays.

If potential members are interested in joining the honor/color guard or would like to observe them, contact guard commander Jim Jackson at 775-443-8507.

The honor guard provides funeral, memorial and commemorative services throughout the communities of northern Nevada, Lake Tahoe, Truckee and other areas as requested. Family members may ask the funeral home to contact the honor guard directly for their participation.

NEW YORK, March 26, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) — Faruqi & Faruqi, LLP, a leading national securities law firm, is investigating potential claims against Zynex, Inc. (“Zynex” or the “Company”) ZYXI and reminds investors of the May 19, 2025 deadline to seek the role of lead plaintiff in a federal securities class action that has been filed against the Company.

Faruqi & Faruqi is a leading national securities law firm with offices in New York, Pennsylvania, California and Georgia. The firm has recovered hundreds of millions of dollars for investors since its founding in 1995. See www.faruqilaw.com.

As detailed below, the complaint alleges that the Company and its executives violated federal securities laws by making false and/or misleading statements and/or failing to disclose: (1) that Zynex shipped products, including electrodes, in excess of need; (2) that, as a result of this practice, the Company inflated its revenue; (3) that the Company’s practice of filing false claims drew scrutiny from insurers, including Tricare; (4) that, as a result, it was reasonably likely that Zynex would face adverse consequences, including removal from insurer networks and penalties from the federal government; and (5) that, as a result of the foregoing, Defendants’ positive statements about the Company’s business, operations, and prospects were materially misleading and/or lacked a reasonable basis.

On June 4, 2024, medical journal STAT published a report on Zynex entitled “How a device maker inundated pain patients with unwanted batteries and surprise bills.” The report claimed Zynex engaged in an “oversupplying scheme” by sending inordinate amounts of monthly supplies like electrode pads and batteries in order to “bill insurers for thousands of dollars more than it otherwise could.” The report further revealed that, as a result of this practice, insurers were “kicking the company out of network.”

On this news, Zynex’s stock price fell $0.50 per share, or 5%, to close at $9.35 per share on June 4, 2024, on unusually heavy trading volume.

On March 11, 2025, after the market closed, Zynex reported its fourth quarter and full year 2024 financial results, revealing a significant revenue “shortfall” in the quarter “due to slower than normal payments from certain payers.” Zynex further revealed “Tricare has temporarily suspended payments as they review prior claims.” Tricare is the health insurance program for the U.S. military.

On this news, Zynex’s stock price fell $3.59 per share, or 51.3%, to close at $3.41 per share on March 12, 2025, on unusually heavy trading volume.

The court-appointed lead plaintiff is the investor with the largest financial interest in the relief sought by the class who is adequate and typical of class members who directs and oversees the litigation on behalf of the putative class. Any member of the putative class may move the Court to serve as lead plaintiff through counsel of their choice, or may choose to do nothing and remain an absent class member. Your ability to share in any recovery is not affected by the decision to serve as a lead plaintiff or not.

Faruqi & Faruqi, LLP also encourages anyone with information regarding Zynex’s conduct to contact the firm, including whistleblowers, former employees, shareholders and others.

To learn more about the Zynex, Inc. class action, go to www.faruqilaw.com/ZYXI or call Faruqi & Faruqi partner Josh Wilson directly at 877-247-4292 or 212-983-9330 (Ext. 1310).

The letter went on to warn TRICARE patients that they would be placed on a waiting list and additional appointments would only be made after payment had resolved.

“So it’s either find another office that will take TRICARE, pay out of pocket, or go on base and wait forever,” Brassard said.

“I find this whole thing repulsive,” she continued, after learning that other military families around the country were experiencing similar issues. Two weeks after receiving that letter of warning, Brassard learned she was dropped from another provider as well.

Jennifer Bittner, the executive director for Exceptional Families of the Military, has been monitoring the situation both for her family and for other military families who are unable to receive services due to the lack of payment. She identified two significant changes in coverage that are the underlying cause.

With new contracts that began Jan. 1, TRICARE made changes to the regional care for military beneficiaries, moving six TRICARE East states to their West region. Bittner explained that there was difficulty in transferring everything at once, resulting in some providers not being contacted about the change and some information simply getting lost in the shuffle. With so many families calling to sort things out, wait times to speak to customer service representatives are longer than usual.

In addition to the regional care change, a new claims processor also went into effect on Jan. 1, which has resulted in delayed payments processing. Those delays, in turn, have led to many medical providers either pausing care or considering dropping TRICARE patients.

“I’m honestly so frustrated and disappointed the system has failed us so badly and all we are told is to ‘wait until February, it’ll be fixed. Wait until March. It’ll be fixed.’ Well, we are halfway through March and things still aren’t fixed,” Bittner said. “I’m in Texas, so I am in a state that switched regions and switched to TriWest. Both my sons have a rare mitochondrial disease, and when we were under [TRICARE] East, their medical team was an approved out-of-network provider.

Artificial intelligence (AI) continues to upend how businesses operate, and the life sciences field is no exception. Generative AI provides life sciences companies the ability to identify and learn from patterns in large data sets. This use of AI has clear applications for the development of life-changing therapies. AI can assist companies with enhancing marketing strategies, driving developments in research and development, and making the manufacturing process more efficient—just to name a few examples.

The increased adoption of AI technologies also invites unique regulatory compliance risks stemming from the growing automation of certain business functions. At the same time, AI also offers companies the ability to innovate and improve their compliance functions.

AI compliance risks

The government is aware of the potential compliance risks accompanying the use of AI. The U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) has a longstanding policy to consider the effectiveness of a company’s compliance program when exercising prosecutorial discretion—e.g., making charging decisions and determining what penalties to seek.

DOJ’s September 2024 update to its guidance on the Evaluation of Corporate Compliance Programs (ECCP) invites consideration of whether or not a corporate compliance program adequately accounts for the impact of emerging technologies like AI on compliance with any applicable rules and regulations. Life sciences companies should carefully consider updates to their compliance programs to address such risks.

For example, in November 2024, the University of Colorado Health (UCHealth) agreed to pay a $23 million civil settlement, without admitting liability, to resolve whistleblower allegations that it violated the False Claims Act (FCA), a federal law prohibiting companies from defrauding the government that can be enforced by both the government and through civil actions for treble damages brought by private whistleblowers. The whistleblower alleged that UCHealth used automatic coding programs and improperly up-coded certain claims submitted to Medicare and TRICARE for all Evaluation & Management services with the highest paying code associated with emergency room visits. The whistleblower further alleged that UCHealth knew that their automatic coding rule did not satisfy Medicare and TRICARE billing requirements because the rule did the reflect the actual resources UCHealth used in association with the claims submitted to the government.

Companies participating in federal healthcare programs may find AI appealing for that exact same task, automating the claims submission process; the UCHealth settlement illustrates how an overreliance on such automated processes, without proper oversight and verification of data inputs, can lead to allegations of defrauding the government.

AI compliance solutions

FCA whistleblowers and the government may use AI to identify potential noncompliance, but companies can implement AI in compliance protocols to identify and address problematic trends and compliance risks before the outside identification of noncompliance. The use of AI over traditional compliance monitoring techniques can result in higher efficiencies that enable companies to identify potential issues in close-to-real-time, even when dealing with vast amounts of data.

Examples include:

• Detection of potential compliance risk areas: For potential kickback, bribery, or other unethical behavior, AI-based detection logic can be used on communications and financial transactions between employees and external parties to detect red-flag behavior (meals, entertainment, and disguised gifts) that are in violation of relevant laws (Stark, anti-kickback statute, anti-bribery laws), as well as company internal policies. Likewise, machine learning algorithms can use historical data and create employee and relationship profiles to assess compliance risks associated with contemplated relationships and transactions before any transactions are entered into.

• Enhance outlier analyses: Particularly for healthcare companies and financial institutions, AI can be used to enhance existing data analysis for outlier-type analyses (e.g., Medicare G code tiering or Medicare Advantage risk adjustment adjustments), both in terms of automation of approach and in the ease of access to readily available analyses for more immediate decision-making and mitigation. AI algorithms can link to publicly available Medicare and Medicaid data, OIG reports, and industry data to analyze outlier potential across multiple data sets.

• Compliance investigations: AI can be used to enhance compliance investigation reports through AI-driven document review and report compilation (e.g., suspicious activity reports). AI can also be used to categorize internal compliance reports (e.g., HR, fraud, misuse of corporate resources), which is an area that has been prone to human error. Similar AI investigation techniques can be used for document production for government-initiated investigations. Increasingly, authorities expect that companies will use AI techniques in document production.

• Evolving regulatory requirements: For heavily regulated industries such as healthcare and banks, AI can be used to stay up to date on evolving regulatory requirements. AI tools can monitor changes in the regulatory landscape and implement necessary changes through automated internal controls and updated compliance policies and procedures.

As with any AI or computer-based learning, the results are dependent on the quality of the input data. Data collection, segregation, and integrity are crucial to the success of any AI-driven compliance solution.

Takeaways

There are many compelling reasons why life sciences companies may explore the uses of AI for the development of therapies and technologies. But when doing so, companies should adopt the following mantra: trust but rigorously verify. Without adequate controls in place, the use of AI could quickly turn a seeming business improvement into a business nightmare.

Companies should also carefully consider how AI-driven innovations can enhance their own compliance monitoring and mitigate—or avoid altogether—the adverse consequences of regulatory noncompliance.

The travel benefit is available to all family members and retirees who are enrolled in TRICARE Prime or TRICARE Prime Remote and live within the 48 contiguous states. It is not available when using TRICARE Select, and there’s a different program for overseas.

The medical care must meet specific criteria. Care must be deemed medically necessary. A suitable specialist must not be available within 100 miles of the patient’s primary care manager. A referral from the primary care manager and prior authorization from TRICARE are required.

If eligible, TRICARE will cover plane or train tickets or mileage reimbursement for car travel and necessary tolls and parking fees.

The program might also cover expenses related to meals and lodging. Reimbursement might not fully cover all out-of-pocket costs. For example, lodging reimbursements might be limited per diem allowances, and meal reimbursements might have daily limits.

To use this benefit, beneficiaries must coordinate with their TRICARE regional contractor for pre-authorization. The contractor verifies the care qualifies

for travel reimbursement and provides instructions on filing a travel reimbursement claim. After traveling, beneficiaries must submit receipts for all claimed expenses, including lodging and meal receipts if applicable.

Your costs depend on your TRICARE plan. Active duty service members and their family members with TRICARE Prime have no costs for maternity services.

How to get maternity care

Your path to maternity care depends on which TRICARE plan you have.

If you have TRICARE Prime:

• Start by calling your primary care manager. Your PCM will help coordinate all your maternity care.

• Does your military hospital or clinic have maternity services? If so, you’ll continue to receive care there.

• If maternity care isn't available at your military hospital or clinic, your PCM will refer you to a civilian provider.

• You don’t have copayments or cost-shares for covered services.

If you have TRICARE Prime Remote:

• Your assigned PCM will direct your care.

• You can see any TRICARE-authorized civilian provider with pre-approval from your regional contractor. Your PCM will help you with the pre-approval process.

If you have TRICARE Select:

• You can see any TRICARE-approved provider without a referral.

• If you see a network provider, you’ll pay less out-of-pocket, and they'll file claims for you.

• Non-network providers might charge more, and you may need to file your own claims.

If you have TRICARE Young Adult:

• You follow the same rules as the plan you chose—either TYA Prime or TYA Select.

• With TYA Prime, you'll work with your assigned PCM for referrals.

• With TYA Select, you can see any TRICARE-approved provider without a referral.

Remember: If you have a baby while on TYA, your child isn’t automatically covered by TRICARE unless the child's other parent is a military sponsor.

For overseas maternity care:

• If you have TRICARE Prime Overseas, you’ll get care at military hospitals and clinics when available. Otherwise, your PCM will refer you to a civilian provider.

• If you have TRICARE Prime Remote Overseas, you should contact the TRICARE Overseas contractor, International SOS, for assistance.

If you have TRICARE Select Overseas, you can see almost any TRICARE-authorized provider. You may need to pay upfront and file for reimbursement.

Dental care during your pregnancy

The TRICARE Dental Program provides a third cleaning in a 12-month period during pregnancy. To use this benefit, let your dental provider know that you're pregnant when scheduling your appointment.

Childbirth and Breastfeeding Support Demonstration updates

The Childbirth and Breastfeeding Support Demonstration gives you access to additional pregnancy and postnatal support. This program helps military families by covering services from specialized providers whose services aren’t otherwise covered by TRICARE.

Here are some answers to frequently asked questions about the CBSD.

Q: Can I use the CBSD?

A:

• You must have TRICARE Prime, TRICARE Prime Remote, or TRICARE Select. (Note: You aren’t eligible if you have TRICARE For Life, the US Family Health Plan, or the Continued Health Care Benefit Program.)

You need to be at least 20 weeks pregnant for childbirth support or 27 weeks for breastfeeding support.

• You must plan to give birth outside a military hospital or clinic.

Q: How has CBSD coverage changed in the U.S.?

A:

• Doulas must now sign a participation agreement.

• You now get a total of six hours of doula support (before or after birth) that can be divided by 15-minute increments, plus unlimited support during birth.

• Doulas can’t charge you for covered services after you meet your deductible. They also can’t ask you to file your own claims.

Q: The CBSD expanded overseas Jan. 1. How do I access CBSD services overseas?

A: You can register for CBSD services with International SOS at any point in pregnancy, before getting any services. They'll try to find a provider within 14 days. You can start receiving care at 20 weeks of pregnancy.

The CBSD covers certified labor doulas who support you during pregnancy, birth, and postpartum, as well as lactation consultants and counselors who help with breastfeeding.

It’s important to know that TRICARE can’t guarantee CBSD services overseas. International SOS will try to find a provider for every eligible and interested beneficiary, but it may not always be possible.

Do you think you may move during your pregnancy? Contact your regional contractor to keep your care on track.

This demonstration runs through Dec. 31, 2026.

Coverage for your baby

Your baby gets their own TRICARE coverage after birth. But you need to take action to ensure continuous coverage:

• Register your baby in the Defense Enrollment Eligibility Reporting System within 90 days in the U.S. or 120 days overseas.

• To register in DEERS, the sponsor must go to a Uniformed Services ID card office. Bring your baby's official birth certificate or FS-240 Consular Report of Birth Abroad.

• If you miss the registration deadline, your baby will only be able to use military pharmacy services and get care at military hospitals and clinics if space is available.

• After registering in DEERS, coverage works differently based on sponsor status:

• Children of ADSMs are automatically enrolled in TRICARE Prime (if they live in a Prime Service Area in the U.S.) or TRICARE Select. Overseas, children are enrolled to TRICARE Select Overseas. You have 90 days from the date of DEERS registration to change your child’s enrollment to TRICARE Prime Overseas or TRICARE Prime Remote Overseas (if available and command-sponsored). You can change your child's plan within 90 days of DEERS registration.

• Children of retirees aren’t automatically enrolled. You must submit enrollment forms to your regional contractor.

• Children of TRICARE Reserve Select or TRICARE Retired Reserve enrollees aren’t automatically enrolled. You must submit enrollment forms to your regional contractor.

To check your child's enrollment, visit milConnect within 90 days of birth.

Childbirth is also a Qualifying Life Event. This means you have 90 days to switch your family’s TRICARE health plan, if you want to make a change. All family members are eligible to change their health plan after a QLE.

“Co-occurring post-traumatic stress disorder and alcohol use disorder, AUD, may be related to unique factors associated with military service, such as aspects of military culture, deployment, and trauma exposure,” he said.
Command notification by health care providers is prohibited for protected health information when a service member voluntarily requests mental health care or substance misuse education, unless the service member authorizes the notification or the disclosure.
Schollnberger said one of the goals of this policy reissuance is improving the health, well-being, and readiness of service members and their families through substance use and gambling disorder education and prevention.
“The DOD fosters a culture of support and strives to create an environment that promotes help-seeking behaviors and reduces the stigma for help-seeking in the provision of mental health care and voluntarily sought substance misuse education.”","According to research published by the National Institutes of Health, service members with prior substance misuse or mental health conditions were 3.9 times and 6.3 times, respectively, more likely to receive a disordered gambling diagnosis than those without substance misuse or mental illness history.

The reissuance of Department of Defense Instruction 1010.04, “Problematic Substance Use and Gambling Disorder,” in January 2025 demonstrates the DOD’s and the Military Health System’s commitment to service members by establishing policies, assigning responsibilities, and prescribing procedures for problematic substance use and gambling disorder prevention, identification, assessment, diagnosis, and treatment for eligible MHS beneficiaries.

Significant updates include:

• Incorporating the prevention, identification, assessment, diagnosis, and treatment of gambling disorder

• Expanding upon the roles and responsibilities of the Addictive Substance Misuse Advisory Committee

• Establishing the addiction medicine personnel serving as champions of substance use disorder care and training

• Expanding the education and training requirements for all mental health providers, treatment staff, commanders and leadership, and DOD personnel in both active and reserve components

• Implementing adherence, documentation, and confidentiality standards, including consent for treatment and resource-sharing best practices

U.S. Navy Cmdr. (Dr.) Elle Marie Schollnberger, director of mental health for the Office of the Assistant Secretary of Defense for Health Services Policy and Oversight, said the DOD emphasizes prevention and early detection practices to reduce the harm and progression of health risks from substance use, including alcohol.

“Substance use and gambling disorders can impact mission readiness and productivity, as well as a service member’s physical and mental health,” said Schollnberger, a board-certified psychiatrist for almost a decade providing care to service members and families at military hospitals and clinics and during deployments.

Expansion of education and training within the document provides a holistic approach to problematic substance use and gambling disorders enabling these concerns to be targeted for prevention, identification and assessment for treatment.

The 2018 Health Related Behaviors Survey data showed that 34% of active duty service members engaged in binge drinking (consuming five or more drinks for men and four or more for women on the same occasion), 9.8% engaged in heaving drinking (binge drinking on at least one or two days a week in the past 30 days) and 6.2% experienced one or more serious consequences from drinking.

Dr. Jonathan Wolf, a senior psychiatrist at the Defense Health Agency, said providing expertise and oversight to improve quality of care concerning substance and addiction treatments for service members across the DOD is a priority due to its impact on service members’ health and individual readiness.

“Co-occurring post-traumatic stress disorder and alcohol use disorder, AUD, may be related to unique factors associated with military service, such as aspects of military culture, deployment, and trauma exposure,” he said. “As part of its public health approach, DOD is committed to the health, well-being, and readiness of service members and their families through promotion of and engagement in prevention, screening, early detection, education, training, and outreach initiatives.”

Some military members may fear their careers will be negatively impacted if they report having substance or gambling addictions or possible dismissal from service. According to Wolf, they do not need to have those concerns. There are treatments and counseling available to get them healthy and return to their units.

“DOD military personnel will be returned to full duty once they have been clinically deemed by appropriately credentialed providers to be on a path towards recovery from the episode and following problematic substance use and gambling disorder treatment whenever consistent with mission requirements,” he said.

Command notification by health care providers is prohibited for protected health information when a service member voluntarily requests mental health care or substance misuse education, unless the service member authorizes the notification or the disclosure. However, providers can inform leadership if they believe there is a serious risk of self-harm, harm to others, or harm to mission, and more specific reasons to notify leadership are available at DODI 6490.08.

Schollnberger said one of the goals of this policy reissuance is improving the health, well-being, and readiness of service members and their families through substance use and gambling disorder education and prevention.

“This approach empirically addresses the whole continuum of care with involvement of those who are connected to DOD personnel in both active and reserve components,” she said. “The DOD fosters a culture of support and strives to create an environment that promotes help-seeking behaviors and reduces the stigma for help-seeking in the provision of mental health care and voluntarily sought substance misuse education.”",https://d1ldvf68ux039x.cloudfront.net/thumbs/photos/2408/8563584/1000w_q95.jpg,N,1.0,2025-03-26 13:56:24.176336

Last September, while in the East, I was diagnosed with skin cancer and began treatment; I finished in November and was due to be rechecked in late December, however my husband had to PCS in early December and the dermatologist wasn't able to recheck that soon. I had some complications that still haven't resolved and based on a lot of (non-expert, nowhere close to a medical professional) internet research I'm not convinced the cancer was completely eliminated.

After PCSing I enrolled in TriWest, which is apparently a bit of a shitshow right now. I had to switch providers six times because nearly all of the listed providers don't actually accept Tricare, aren't in this area anymore, or are no longer practicing at all. I finally found a single provider who accepts Tricare - not the whole facility, apparently it's just this one provider who works out of a few different locations. I was able to get an appointment with her, two months out - the appointment was supposed to be today. This morning I got an email that the appointment has been cancelled; immediately called to reschedule and the earliest they can get me in for a new patient visit at any location is mid-June.

I really need to see a dermatologist, but apparently I can't do that without a referral, which I can't get without seeing a doctor, which I can't do for another three months. Having been a front desk rep, I know it's not their fault and there's very little they can do, but I still tried getting them to work with me to get me in for just five minutes with the doctor. Unsurprisingly, nothing doing.

I've been very lucky in my life, haven't had to see a doctor for much other than the occasional checkup, and only twice since enrolling in Tricare. For those of you who understand it better than I - is there ANYTHING I can do to get a referral without first having a new patient visit with a doctor? I called around to find out the cost of seeing a dermatologist without a referral/not going through insurance, and I definitely can't afford it at this time.

Vitamins and minerals found in fruits, vegetables, and whole grains supports immune function, ensuring service members stay fit to fight.
Service members experience this firsthand.
When service members are deployed, dining can become a moment of connection that boosts morale and sustains resilience.","MARCH 26, 2025 – Whether we’re deployed, training stateside, or sitting down with family at home, the food we consume not only fuels our bodies but also strengthens our bonds with one another. Reflecting on the importance of proper nutrition for health and the acknowledgement of how food unites us as a community. These concepts ring true with service members, where shared meals support mission readiness and build camaraderie.

The Importance of Nutrition in the Military

In the military, nutrition is more than a personal choice – it’s a mission-critical component. Every Soldier, Sailor, Airman, Marine, and Guardian depends on proper nutrition to perform at their peak. Balanced diets rich in essential nutrients enhance physical endurance, mental clarity and recovery from intense activity. For example, incorporating complex carbohydrates, lean proteins and healthy fats into meals provides sustained energy for rucksack marches or demanding physical training sessions. Vitamins and minerals found in fruits, vegetables, and whole grains supports immune function, ensuring service members stay fit to fight. Hydration is another cornerstone of nutrition, as staying hydrated supports cognitive function and minimizes fatigue.

For service members who are training or deployed, operational rations, such as Meals, Ready-to-Eat, or MREs, or Unitized Groups Rations, known as UGRs, are designed to meet nutritional needs in challenging environments. While these rations may not replace the comfort of a home-cooked meal, they demonstrate how food is tailored to meet specific missions and sustain service members around the world.

Food as a Cultural Bridge

We all know that food is not just fuel—it’s a bridge that connects people across cultures, ranks and generations. Service members experience this firsthand. Shared meals in the dining facility, potlucks during holidays, and barbecues after field exercises all create opportunities to foster relationships and build unit cohesion. When service members are deployed, dining can become a moment of connection that boosts morale and sustains resilience.

“As the military sends service members all around the world, one of the many benefits of experiencing new cultures is also trying new foods,” said Joanna Reagan, a public health nutritionist with Defense Health Agency – Public Health in Aberdeen, Maryland. “Opportunities to eat or cook in new locations expands knowledge of spices, cooking styles, new ingredients and shopping experiences. Certainly, the location affects how adventurous one might be in trying new foods while keeping the principles of food safety in mind.”

Food also connects us to our heritage and reminds us of home. A meal from childhood or a favorite family recipe shared during downtime can provide comfort and strengthen resilience for service members stationed far away from friends and family. Sharing traditional dishes from another culture promotes understanding, camaraderie and appreciation of diversity.

“Sharing your favorite recipes and traditions with others can create lifetime memories, not to mention expanding your list of favorite recipes,” added Reagan.

Leading by Example

Military leaders play a vital role in modeling healthy eating habits. Leaders have an opportunity to model healthy habits that may influence service members’ behaviors. Demonstrating a commitment to nutrition by choosing balanced meals, encouraging hydration, and avoiding excessive junk food sets a positive example.

“Military leaders shape the culture of eating habits within the units they lead,” said U.S. Navy Capt. Melissa Troncoso, a family nurse practitioner and researcher at the Uniformed Services University’s Daniel K. Inouye Graduate School of Nursing in Bethesda, Maryland. “Through their food choices, recommendations for unit events, and advocacy for healthier options within the food environment, they can promote a lifestyle of good nutrition.”

Leaders can also advocate for nutrition education. Military installations offer resources such as dietitians and health promotion programs designed to educate service members and their families on healthy eating. At Armed Forces Wellness Centers, service members and their families; retirees; and Department of Defense civilians can utilize health coaches to revie w health habits, analyze risk factors or explore personal health and wellness goals. AFWCs can be found on many installations. Leaders encouraging their teams to take advantage of these resources promotes mission readiness as well as long-term health and well-being.

Strengthening Family Bonds Through Food

For families, food is often the centerpiece of connection. Whether they gather to share a holiday meal or a quick dinner before a parent heads out for a late-night duty shift, families can enjoy spending time eating together.

Military spouses and children also play an important role in maintaining the nutritional health of the household. Preparing meals together can teach children about healthy eating habits and provide a sense of normalcy amid the unique challenges of military life. Cooking as a family is a chance to strengthen relationships and create lasting memories.

“Loneliness and isolation increase the risk for individuals to develop mental health challenges,” said U.S. Army Lt. Col. Melissa Boyd, a clinical psychologist with DHA-Public Health in Aberdeen. “Sitting down together to build connection over food can improve the physical and mental health of all family members involved and has been linked to preventing eating disorders, alcohol and substance abuse, violence, depression and suicidality.”

Family meals also encourage open communication and motivate parents to listen to children talk about their day, which communicates they are valued, said Boyd.

Research has shown that family meals support the health and well-being of children and parents, demonstrating the benefits of spending time together during meals for the whole family.

Conclusion

Take a moment to appreciate the many ways food impacts our lives. In the military, food is not only fuel — it enhances unity, resilience, and readiness. Prioritizing nutrition and sharing meals together strengthens the bonds that make our military community unique.

This month, take the opportunity to evaluate your nutritional habits and find ways to connect with those around you through food. Whether you’re sitting down for a meal with your team, trying a new recipe with your family, or learning about the cuisine of another culture, let food be the common ground that connects you to the people in your life.

While many healthcare companies come to WSU's campus, CareSource stands apart in many ways.

What is CareSource?

In addition to the company's purpose to help its members, another big part of CareSource is its volunteer opportunities. If a need is presented, like helping a food bank or cleaning parks, employees of CareSource can take work time to do these projects, while still being paid.

There are even more volunteer opportunities for interns, as CareSource has community impact projects as part of its internships.

Getting involved with CareSource

CareSource has partnered with WSU many times in the past, coming to campus to talk to students about employment. They have always tried to give students information about applying to get more recruits for their internships and open job opportunities.

Associate Director of External Relations and Events Julie Wielonski shared why they continue to come to campus and talk to students.

“Many CareSource employees have built strong relationships with the students here. They send representatives to explain what exactly CareSource is and to get their mission out there. Also, they walk students through the whole application process so they have the greatest chance of being hired, should they apply,” Wielonski said.

CareSource has open positions, both internships and paid roles, for students of all majors. With all the different areas within the company, anyone can apply.

One of the biggest draws for students is their internship program. They have 12-week internships over the summer where students can work with actual CareSource employees and get a feel for how their day to day would work.

Jacob Haseley started at CareSource as an intern. He has now been in a paid position in HR for three years and shared a little bit about the goal of the internship programs.

“We want you to enhance yourselves professionally. These internships look great on a resume, but also we want you to bond with your community,” Haseley said.

If you are graduating and looking for a job, or a current student looking to build your resume with internships and volunteer opportunities, be sure to watch for more campus events with CareSource to get more information about the recruitment process.",https://snworksceo.imgix.net/wsg/3cf08ac7-cb4d-440a-8079-4d90d24f4129.sized-1000x1000.jpg?w=800&h=600,N,0.0,2025-03-26 13:56:28.960972

You have about a week (as of this writing) to sign up for the Tricare FSA.
If you miss that deadline, you'll need to wait until open season in the fall to sign up for a Tricare FSA for 2026.
Specifically, the Tricare FSA does allow you to carry over $660 in funds, but only if you re-enroll in the FSA.

Co-pays and expenses not covered by Tricare can eat into your budget. But what if you could get some of those expenses on sale 15%, 22% or maybe more? With a Health Care Flexible Spending Account (HCFSA) you can.

What is a HCFSA?

A HCFSA allows you to contribute money pre-tax to an account that you can use to pay for qualified health care expenses. Specifically, you can contribute up to $3,300 (2025) to a HCFSA per year.

The amount you contribute to a HCFSA is not subject to Social Security Tax (6.2%); Medicare Tax (2.9%); Federal Income Tax (10% - 28% or more) or State Income Tax (if you're subject to it).

What I can I Spend HCFSA Funds On?

You can use the funds for several things. Here is a partial list:

Deductibles and copayments

Wellness care like chiropractors, acupuncture and massage therapy

Dental Care

Eyeglasses

Even Sunscreen

For a full list of what the funds can be used for visit FSAFEDS.gov

Who is Eligible for a Tricare FSA?

The list of who is eligible is about what you would think.

Active Duty

Reserve Forces on Active Duty Orders

National Guard Members Performing Active Guard Reserve Duty

How Do I Sign up for a Tricare FSA?

You have about a week (as of this writing) to sign up for the Tricare FSA. You need to do it by 31 Mar 25. If you miss that deadline, you'll need to wait until open season in the fall to sign up for a Tricare FSA for 2026.

Are There Downsides to Using a HCFSA?

Probably the biggest downside to a HCFSA is use it or lose it. In most cases if you contribute funds to a HCFSA and don't spend them in that calendar year, you lose the funds. Specifically, the Tricare FSA does allow you to carry over $660 in funds, but only if you re-enroll in the FSA.

Also, if you lose your job after you contribute to a HCFSA and haven't spent the money, you lose it as well. Granted that scenario is pretty unlikely for a military member.

Military Finances are Different

Civilians have had access to HCFSA's for years (maybe even decades). This isn't the only way civilian and military finances are different. In fact military members and veterans have significant opportunities and benefits not available to civilians. That is why we think you should work with a financial advisor or planner that works with Active and Retired Senior Military Officers and NCO's each and every day.

Those who inquire by e-mail are encouraged to include their mailing address, telephone number, and the number of shares purchased.

The class action concerns whether Zynex and certain of its officers and/or directors have engaged in securities fraud or other unlawful business practices.

You have until May 19, 2025 to ask the Court to appoint you as Lead Plaintiff for the class if you purchased or otherwise acquired Zynex securities during the Class Period. A copy of the Complaint can be obtained at www.pomerantzlaw.com.

[Click here for information about joining the class action]

On June 4, 2024, medical journal STAT published a report on Zynex entitled “How a device maker inundated pain patients with unwanted batteries and surprise bills.” The report claimed Zynex engaged in an “oversupplying scheme” by sending inordinate amounts of monthly supplies like electrode pads and batteries in order to “bill insurers for thousands of dollars more than it otherwise could.” The report further revealed that, as a result of this practice, insurers were “kicking the company out of network.”

On this news, Zynex’s stock price fell $0.50 per share, or 5%, to close at $9.35 per share on June 4, 2024.

Then, on March 11, 2025, Zynex reported its fourth quarter and full year 2024 financial results, revealing a revenue “shortfall” in the quarter “due to slower than normal payments from certain payers.” Zynex also revealed that Tricare, the healthcare program for uniformed service members that “currently represents approximately 20-25% of [the Company's] annual revenue”, “has temporarily suspended payments as they review prior claims.”

On this news, Zynex’s stock price fell $3.59 per share, or 51.3%, to close at $3.41 per share on March 12, 2025.

Pomerantz LLP, with offices in New York, Chicago, Los Angeles, London, Paris, and Tel Aviv, is acknowledged as one of the premier firms in the areas of corporate, securities, and antitrust class litigation. Founded by the late Abraham L. Pomerantz, known as the dean of the class action bar, Pomerantz pioneered the field of securities class actions. Today, more than 85 years later, Pomerantz continues in the tradition he established, fighting for the rights of the victims of securities fraud, breaches of fiduciary duty, and corporate misconduct. The Firm has recovered numerous multimillion-dollar damages awards on behalf of class members. See www.pomlaw.com.

Zynex, Inc. (ZYXI) Securities Class Action:

The litigation is focused on the propriety of Zynex's statements about its sales and billing practices, its revenue recognition practices, and its relationship with the military health program for active-duty soldiers and their family members (""Tricare""), which represents 20 - 25% of company's revenue.

The complaint alleges that Zynex made false and misleading statements while failing to disclose crucial information to investors. More specifically, the suit alleges that:

Zynex shipped product, including electrodes, in excess of customers' needs;

As a result of this practice, Zynex inflated its revenues;

Zynex's practice of filing false claims drew scrutiny from insurers, including Tricare; and

As a. result, it was reasonably likely that Zynex would face adverse consequences such as removal from insurer networks and penalties by the federal government.

Investors began to learn the truth on June 4, 2024, when medical journal STAAT published ""How a device maker inundated pain patients with unwanted batteries and surprise bills."" This report claimed that Zynex engaged in an ""oversupplying scheme"" by sending inordinate amounts of monthly supplies like electrode pads and batteries in order to ""bill insurers for thousands of dollars more than it otherwise could."" STAAT further revealed that, as a result of this practice, insurers were ""kicking the company out of network.""

Then, on March 11, 2025, Zynex reported dismal Q4 and FY 2024 financial results. The company's Q4 revenue implied a 2% drop from the year-earlier period and YE net income per share plummeted from $0.27 in 2023 to $0.09 in 2024. According to Zynex CEO Thomas Sandgaard ""[o]ur fourth quarter revenue was less than expected[]"" and ""[t]he shortfall was due to slower than normal payments from certain payers and we were recently notified that Tricare has temporarily suspended payments as they review prior claims.""

""We are concerned about potential issues with Zynex's revenue recognition and sales practices,"" said Reed Kathrein, the Hagens Berman Partner leading the firm's probe.

MARLTON, N.J., March 25, 2025 /PRNewswire/ -- Console & Associates, P.C. announced it is investigating a securities class action lawsuit filed in federal court on behalf of purchasers of Zynex, Inc. (NASDAQ: ZYXI) securities between March 13, 2023 and March 11, 2025, inclusive (the ""Class Period"").

Interested investors must file their motion with the Court no later than May 19, 2025.

Zynex, Inc. develops, manufactures, and markets medical devices for pain management and rehabilitation. The Company specializes in electrotherapy technology for non-invasive pain relief and muscle stimulation.

According to the complaint, during March 13, 2023 and March 11, 2025, defendants made materially false and misleading statements and/or failed to disclose adverse information regarding Zynex's business and operations. Specifically, defendants allegedly failed to disclose that:

Zynex shipped products, including electrodes, in excess of patient need;

The Company inflated its revenue through these excessive shipment practices;

Zynex's practice of filing questionable claims drew scrutiny from insurers, including Tricare;

As a result, Zynex faced significant risk of adverse consequences, including potential removal from insurer networks and federal government penalties;

These practices made defendants' statements about Zynex's business, operations, and prospects materially misleading and/or lacking reasonable basis.

On March 11, 2025, Zynex announced its fourth quarter and full year 2024 financial results, revealing a significant revenue ""shortfall"" in the quarter ""due to slower than normal payments from certain payers."" The Company also disclosed that ""Tricare has temporarily suspended payments as they review prior claims."" Tricare reportedly represents approximately 20-25% of Zynex's annual revenue.

Following this news, Zynex's stock price fell $3.59 per share, or 51.3%, to close at $3.41 per share on March 12, 2025.

There are two FSAs offered:

The Dependent Care FSA (DCFSA)

The Health Care FSA (HCFSA)

These FSAs can help cover eligible dependent care and healthcare expenses like TRICARE deductibles, copayments, and other non-covered services, making it a useful tool for managing medical costs.

It is clear that military health agencies need a path forward to efficiently deliver preventive care.
To achieve this end, mission-driven healthcare agencies can prioritize seamless, secure electronic access to enrollment, care, health records, educational health information and materials, and more.","This article appeared on GovernmentTechnologyInsider. View the original article here.

While the federal healthcare ecosystem undergoes transformation, the ability for service personnel to access care through the Defense Health Agency (DHA) remains essential to supporting a mission-ready force. It is also important for Veterans to receive high quality care from the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA). As we think of personalized care and modernization, these two organizations will need to partner for the best possible care as they serve a combined 18.5M+ beneficiaries.

Today, many beneficiaries expect digital, personalized experiences when accessing care and benefit services. Providing this tailored, omni-channel service is a monumental task. However, a digital approach to health services powered by advanced technologies and human-centered design can create a simple, seamless, and secure customer experience (CX). This includes access to care and information with centralized user portals, as well as portability of healthcare data between agencies. These health services can then keep pace with the military community’s healthcare needs and ensures our nation can respond rapidly to evolving mission readiness priorities.

Reimagining CX to deliver preventive healthcare – anytime, anywhere

Today, it’s well understood that healthcare doesn’t just need to happen when a beneficiary is unwell and requires care. Healthcare must be preventive to improve health outcomes, lower costs to health systems, and decrease risks to mission readiness. Consider that Military Health System (MHS) medical encounters increased by 18 percent between 2022 and 2023 alone, increasing costs to MHS and underscoring the need for prevention to keep beneficiaries healthy and ready to serve. It is clear that military health agencies need a path forward to efficiently deliver preventive care.

To achieve this end, mission-driven healthcare agencies can prioritize seamless, secure electronic access to enrollment, care, health records, educational health information and materials, and more. Doing so will mark a significant improvement over traditional government services and paper forms that are difficult to track and manage and often lead to inefficient, fragmented care.

For example, the Defense Health Agency (DHA) has launched several initiatives to provide a secure digital entry for beneficiaries by consolidating and standardizing solutions to enhance and simplify healthcare information technology (IT) for users across the MHS. The goal is to deliver seamless health IT solutions to support healthcare delivery to 9.6 million military beneficiaries worldwide, improving patient care and experience and providing real-time information distribution while allowing for flexible healthcare options.

Prioritizing personalized care to deliver better health outcomes

Access to services, as well as the type of information available to patients, has a critical impact on patient behavior and individual health outcomes. Every beneficiary has a unique healthcare journey, and research from the National Institutes of Health shows that personalized experiences are more effective than rigid approaches for creating sustained health behavior change. In turn, this can positively impact health outcomes and support mission readiness.

Prioritizing personalized care requires consideration of various health conditions and life stages. For example, younger generations may want to access services and information in digital formats while other generations are less accustomed to online services. An example of this generation gap comes from my own family. My stepdaughter, who is active in the military, was interested in setting up an appointment with a business that I’ve used for years – only to learn it did not accept online bookings. So, she chose another option that fit her “anytime, anywhere” expectations for digital CX. Indeed, technology has radically changed our daily lives.

Healthcare agencies must serve both digital enthusiasts and those more comfortable with traditional technologies. Through decades of work with health agencies, including the VA, Maximus has learned valuable lessons by analyzing data about how people seek and receive services. Technologies that make this data actionable are now mature, accessible, and readily available.

One of the many advanced technologies successfully implemented in contact centers in recent years is an Intelligent Virtual Assistant, designed to deliver conversational self-service to the public. This technology allows them to use a multi-channel approach to provide access to critical information using the customer’s preferred method, enhancing the user experience by providing timely information.

Improving our nation’s military readiness

While the benefits of delivering personalized healthcare to service personnel and retirees, their families, and Veterans are easy to identify, the broader impact ultimately extends to national security. This comes at a time when military retirements are at an all-time high, and global threats are increasing. Amidst these vulnerabilities, maintaining a mission-ready military is vital.

To this end, unified Electronic Health Records (EHR) accessible from every base hospital to every field hospital ensure seamless continuation of care for service personnel regardless of where they are stationed, whether on temporary duty assignment (TDY) or deployed. Additionally, when service personnel have assurance that their families are being cared for, they can focus on the mission without distraction.

Delivering modernized healthcare today

By providing services through all available channels of a secure digital platform, agencies can succeed in delivering unified, tailored healthcare experiences. As agency leaders embrace personalized experiences to deliver a better standard of care, expert integration partners can deliver robust change management to understand beneficiary needs and ensure the right mix of advanced technologies is in place to address those needs and fulfill the mission. The future of healthcare lies in personalized care for all, enabled by technologies that offer choice and access—anytime, anywhere.",,N,0.0,2025-03-25 20:56:16.724052

CLICK HERE TO RECEIVE ADDITIONAL INFORMATION ABOUT THIS POTENTIAL CLASS ACTION

Zynex is a medical device manufacturer that produces and markets electrotherapy devices for use in pain management and physical rehabilitation. The Company's products are small, battery powered electronic devices which deliver electric pulses via wires and electrode pads.

The Class Action alleges that, during the Class Period, Defendants shipped excess products to its customers and filed false claims with insurers, including Tricare (the health insurance program for the U.S. military), which inflated Zynex's revenue and resulted in the removal of Zynex from insurer networks and penalties from the federal government.

On June 4, 2024, medical journal STAT published a report on Zynex entitled ""How a device maker inundated pain patients with unwanted batteries and surprise bills."" The report claimed, among other things, Zynex engaged in an ""oversupplying scheme."" On this news, Zynex's stock price fell $0.50 per share, or 5%, to close at $9.35 per share on June 4, 2024. Finally, on March 11, 2025, after market hours, Zynex reported its 4Q24 and FY24 financial results, revealing a significant revenue ""shortfall"" in the quarter ""due to slower than normal payments from certain payers."" Zynex further revealed ""Tricare has temporarily suspended payments as they review prior claims."" On this news, Zynex's stock price fell $3.59 per share, or 51.3%, to close at $3.41 per share on March 12, 2025, on unusually heavy trading volume.

For up to the next five years, TRICARE will cover Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved monoclonal antibodies (MABs) lecanemab (brand name Leqembi) and donanemab (brand name Kisunla), for the treatment of Alzheimer’s disease in patients with mild cognitive impairment or in the mild dementia stage of the disease. The assistant secretary of defense for health affairs approved the change last October.

MOAA has worked to fix this coverage gap since the 118th Congress alongside stakeholders like The Military Coalition (TMC) – a group of military and veterans service organizations representing nearly 5.5 million members combined.

[MEMBER-EXCLUSIVE MOAA PUBLICATION: Transitioning Into Medicare and TRICARE For Life]

Reimbursement Options

MOAA has confirmed reimbursements for Leqembi and Kisunla are in effect. Beneficiaries whose claims were paid by Medicare but denied by TRICARE should contact the WPS customer service team for assistance in ensuring those claims are now processed under TRICARE For Life.

There is no need to submit a corrected claim – simply reach out with details on the affected claims for reconsideration.

You can contact the WPS customer service team through the TRICARE4u.com portal or by calling (866) 773-0404. Coverage is retroactive to Oct. 23, 2024, the provisional decision approval date.

Filling the Gap

Several impacted MOAA members initially alerted MOAA to this coverage gap; we appreciate their outreach, along with the support of members who reached out to their lawmakers on this issue via our Legislative Action Center.

Before the provisional coverage decision, TRICARE’s outdated policy excluded coverage of MABs, including Leqembi, even though the drug has had full FDA approval since July 6, 2023.

TRICARE and Medicare enrollment As a veteran, your coverage under TRICARE ends once you become eligible for Medicare.
How Medicare and TRICARE work together When you have Medicare and TRICARE For Life, you can visit any authorized provider.","Service members who leave active duty may qualify for health care coverage through either the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) or TRICARE, depending on how they separated from the military.

But what happens to your VA or TRICARE benefits when you turn 65, which is the age most people become eligible for Medicare? Do veterans and military retirees have to take Medicare Part A and Medicare Part B, or do the VA and TRICARE provide enough coverage?

It’s all about what works for you. Medicare can add another layer of coverage, protection, cost savings, and convenience if you already have VA benefits or TRICARE. Here’s how.

VA benefits and Medicare enrollment

You can be enrolled in benefits through Veterans Affairs (VA) and Medicare at the same time. Having both gives you more options for care, as well as the flexibility and freedom to choose providers within the VA or with a non-VA provider in your Medicare network. Plus, Medicare Advantage plans can come with extra benefits that most veterans don’t receive through the VA, such as dental, vision, gym memberships, over-the-counter allowances and transportation benefits.

How Medicare and VA benefits work together

Although you can have benefits through Veterans Affairs (VA) and Medicare, you’ll need to choose which benefits you want to use when receiving care:

To use your VA benefits, you must visit a VA doctor or VA medical facility. The VA may also cover care at a non-VA facility if it’s preauthorized.

To use your Medicare benefits, you must receive care at a Medicare-authorized facility. In some cases, Medicare may also be able to pay for services the VA has not authorized.

What Medicare does and doesn’t cover will depend on your plan, where you’re receiving care, and which benefits you plan to use — if you can use both.

TRICARE and Medicare enrollment

As a veteran, your coverage under TRICARE ends once you become eligible for Medicare. That means you’ll need to enroll in Medicare Parts A and B during your Initial Enrollment Period to avoid any lapse in TRICARE coverage. When you enroll in Medicare Parts A and B, TRICARE will automatically switch to TRICARE For Life (TFL). TFL acts as supplemental coverage for your Medicare plan. That means Medicare is your primary payer, while TFL reduces or eliminates out-of-pocket costs for deductibles, coinsurance, and copayments.

How Medicare and TRICARE work together

When you have Medicare and TRICARE For Life, you can visit any authorized provider. Here’s how the two work together to pay your health care costs:

The provider will file the claim(s) with Medicare.

Medicare will then pay the portion it’s responsible for and send the claim to the TRICARE For Life.

TRICARE For Life will pay its portion directly to the provider for the services TRICARE covers.

There are so many factors to consider when choosing the Medicare coverage that is right for you, and it can be an overwhelming process. We would love for you to schedule a free consultation to go over your unique needs. We want to empower you to choose the coverage that is the best for you.",https://lirp.cdn-website.com/038f6fe5/dms3rep/multi/opt/VA-1920w.jpg,N,1.0,2025-03-26 05:56:17.979104

The Fort Carson Intrepid Spirit Center, or ISC, is a state-of-the-art treatment facility dedicated to the assessment and care of concussions and other forms of brain Injuries.

“As part of the Defense Intrepid Network, the Intrepid Spirit Center provides comprehensive care and support for service members, veterans, and their families who have experienced traumatic brain injuries,” said U.S. Public Health Service Cmdr. Steve Spoonemore, a board-certified orthopedic clinical specialist and physical therapist with the Fort Carson ISC. “Our primary mission is getting service members back to duty in order to maintain an effective fighting force.”

Spoonemore says that many of the symptoms with traumatic brain injury are difficult to see externally yet impact the ability for service members to function in their military and family roles.

“The team-based care model helps us identify the associated symptoms of TBI, address them in comprehensive way, and empower the service member and family with tools to maintain optimum capability,” Spoonemore said.

Dr Brian Kelly, the deputy director of the ISC, says that these “invisible injuries” often go unrecognized, making events like this crucial.

“The military is deeply committed to addressing brain injuries to enhance warfighter readiness and improve quality of life during and after military service,” Kelly said. “The brain plays a vital role in numerous functions, from mood to memory to marksmanship. Just as soldiers once sharpened their swords for battle, we strive to ensure today’s service members have sharp minds, free from symptoms.”

Kelly says that treatment at the ISC is highly individualized based on patient needs and goals. Services provided often include medication management, physical therapy, occupational therapy, neuropsychology, speech and cognitive rehabilitation, art therapy, and music therapy.

The ISC also sees other TRICARE beneficiary categories, to include family members and retirees.

(NASDAQ: ZYXI) securities between March 13, 2023 and March 11, 2025, inclusive (the ""Class Period"").

Investors who purchased Zynex securities during the Class Period may be entitled to seek appointment as lead plaintiff in this case.

Interested investors must file their motion with the Court no later than May 19, 2025.

Zynex, Inc. develops, manufactures, and markets medical devices for pain management and rehabilitation. The Company specializes in electrotherapy technology for non-invasive pain relief and muscle stimulation.

According to the complaint, during March 13, 2023 and March 11, 2025, defendants made materially false and misleading statements and/or failed to disclose adverse information regarding Zynex's business and operations. Specifically, defendants allegedly failed to disclose that:

Zynex shipped products, including electrodes, in excess of patient need;

The Company inflated its revenue through these excessive shipment practices;

Zynex's practice of filing questionable claims drew scrutiny from insurers, including Tricare;

As a result, Zynex faced significant risk of adverse consequences, including potential removal from insurer networks and federal government penalties;

These practices made defendants' statements about Zynex's business, operations, and prospects materially misleading and/or lacking reasonable basis.

On March 11, 2025, Zynex announced its fourth quarter and full year 2024 financial results, revealing a significant revenue ""shortfall"" in the quarter ""due to slower than normal payments from certain payers."" The Company also disclosed that ""Tricare has temporarily suspended payments as they review prior claims."" Tricare reportedly represents approximately 20-25% of Zynex's annual revenue.

Following this news, Zynex's stock price fell $3.59 per share, or 51.3%, to close at $3.41 per share on March 12, 2025.

If you purchased Zynex securities during the Class Period and wish to serve as lead plaintiff in this case, you must file a motion with the Court no later than May 19, 2025. For more information about your legal rights and potential remedies, please complete our contact form.

Initiated exploration and analysis of real-world evidence in people with Cystic Fibrosis (CF) on the relationship between Pseudomonas aeruginosa reduction and clinical outcomes, ahead of expected regulatory discussions in second half of 2025

NESS ZIONA, Israel, March 25, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- BiomX Inc. (NYSE American: PHGE, the “Company” or “BiomX”), a clinical-stage company advancing novel natural and engineered phage therapies that target specific pathogenic bacteria, today announced financial results for the fourth quarter and full year ended December 31, 2024, and provided program and business updates.

“BiomX is in the process of finalizing the analysis of topline results from the Phase 2 trial of BX211 in DFO, with readout expected by the end of the quarter,” said Jonathan Solomon, Chief Executive Officer of BiomX. “In the first quarter of 2025, we also completed a financing round that generated $12 million in gross proceeds. We believe that these resources will enable readout of BX004 Phase 2b topline results, which are anticipated in the first quarter of 2026. In addition, the funds will support the analysis of real-world evidence to assess the relationship between Pseudomonas aeruginosa reduction and clinical outcomes in individuals with cystic fibrosis ahead of regulatory discussions expected in the second half of this year.”

Clinical Program Updates

BX211 – phage for the treatment of DFO associated with Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus)

BiomX expects to report initial topline results from the Phase 2 trial evaluating BX211 for the treatment of DFO by the end of March 2025. The safety, tolerability, and efficacy of BX211 are being evaluated in a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multi-center Phase 2 study for individuals with DFO associated with S. aureus. The topline results will evaluate healing of the wound associated with osteomyelitis at Week 13. The Phase 2 study design was guided in part by experience with numerous compassionate cases using phage therapy for the treatment of DFO and osteomyelitis.

In October 2024, BiomX received a milestone payment from the U.S. Defense Health Agency (DHA), approved to support the BX211 Phase 2 trial in DFO. To date, total non-dilutive funding received for this study has reached $36.8 million.

BX004 – fixed phage cocktail for the treatment of cystic fibrosis (CF) in patients with chronic pulmonary infections caused by Pseudomonas aeruginosa (P. aeruginosa)

Trial remains on track to report topline results in the first quarter of 2026. During the fourth quarter of 2024, BiomX encountered manufacturing delays relating to scaling up of materials for the larger phase 2 trial. These challenges have since been resolved, supporting continued progress in the program.

Discussions with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and other regulatory authorities are expected during the second half of 2025, during which the Company intends to present its analyses of real-world evidence and will seek to obtain endorsement that supports potential future regulatory filings.

Business Update

BiomX entered into a securities purchase agreement with investors in February 2025 in connection with a registered direct offering, concurrent private placement of the Company’s securities, and simultaneous exercise of certain existing common stock purchase warrants. Aggregate gross proceeds were approximately $12 million, before deducting placement agent fees and other offering expenses. Following these offerings, the Company expects to have sufficient funding to reach substantial inflection points, including topline results of its Phase 2b study of BX004 in the first quarter of 2026.

Full Year 2024 Financial Results

Cash balance and restricted cash as of December 31, 2024 were $18.0 million, compared to $15.9 million as of December 31, 2023. The increase was primarily due to funds raised in the Company’s March 2024 financing, partly offset by net cash used in operating activities. The December 31, 2024 cash balance does not reflect the additional $12 million in gross proceeds raised in the Company’s February 2025 financing round. BiomX estimates its cash, cash equivalents and short-term deposits are sufficient to fund its operations into the first quarter of 2026.

Research and development expenses, net were $24.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2024, compared to $16.7 million for the prior year. The increase was primarily due to the following factors: preparations for the Phase 2b clinical trial of the Company’s CF product candidate, BX004; an increase in expenses relating to the Phase 2 clinical trial of the Company’s DFO product candidate, BX211; and an increase in rent and related expenses following the March acquisition of Adaptive Phage Therapeutics (APT). This increase was partly offset by higher governmental grants BiomX received.

General and administrative expenses were $11.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2024, compared to $8.7 million for the prior year. The increase is primarily attributed to a consolidation of expenses following APT’s acquisition, incorporating the combined workforce, increased professional services, and additional subcontractor expenses.

Goodwill impairment was $0.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2024, following an impairment of the Company’s goodwill resulting from the APT acquisition. The Company had no goodwill impairment in the year ended December 31, 2023.

IPR&D impairment was $3.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2024, following the Company’s quantitative assessment for in process research and development (IPR&D) impairment. The Company had no IPR&D impairment in the year ended December 31, 2023.

Long-lived assets impairment was $4.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2024, after evaluating the right-of-use asset and related leasehold improvements following the Company’s decision to cease the use of the property in Gaithersburg, Maryland and make it available for sublease. The Company had no long-lived assets impairment in the year ended December 31, 2023.

Net loss for 2024 was $17.7 million, compared to $26.2 million for the prior year. The decrease is mainly due to the change in the fair value of the warrants issued as part of the Company’s March 2024 financing.

Net cash used in operating activities for the year ended December 31, 2024 was $37 million, compared to $21.3 million for the same period in 2023.

Conference Call and Webcast

BiomX intends to host a conference call and a live audio webcast at a later date to discuss its fourth quarter and full year 2024 financial results, in conjunction with its expected announcement of initial topline results from its Phase 2 trial for subjects with DFO.

About BX004

BiomX is developing BX004, a fixed multi-phage cocktail, for the treatment of CF patients with chronic pulmonary infections caused by P. aeruginosa, a main contributor to morbidity and mortality in patients with CF. In November 2023, BiomX announced positive topline results from Part 2 of the Phase 1b/2a trial where BX004 demonstrated improvement in pulmonary function associated with a reduction in P. aeruginosa burden compared to placebo in a predefined subgroup of patients with reduced lung function (baseline FEV1P. aeruginosa pulmonary infections. The trial is designed to enroll approximately 60 patients randomized at a 2:1 ratio to BX004 or placebo. Treatment is expected to be administered via inhalation twice daily for a duration of 8 weeks. The trial is designed to monitor the safety and tolerability of BX004 and is designed to demonstrate improvement in microbiological reduction of P. aeruginosa burden and evaluation of effects on clinical parameters such as lung function measured by FEV1 and patient reported outcomes. Pending progress of the trial, topline results are expected in the first quarter of 2026. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (“FDA”) has granted BX004 Fast Track designation and Orphan Drug Designation.

About BX211

BX211 is a phage treatment for the treatment of DFO associated with S. aureus. DFO is a bacterial infection of the bone that usually develops from an infected foot ulcer and is a leading cause of amputation in patients with diabetes. The ongoing randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multi-center Phase 2 trial investigating the safety, tolerability, and efficacy of BX211 for subjects with DFO associated with S. aureus has finished enrollment of patients, randomized at a 2:1 ratio of BX211 to placebo. BX211 or placebo is designed to be administered weekly, by topical and IV route at Week 1 and by the topical route only at each of Weeks 2-12. Over the 12-week treatment period, all subjects are expected to continue to be treated in accordance with standard of care which will include antibiotic treatment as appropriate. A first readout of study topline results is expected at Week 13 evaluating healing of the wound associated with osteomyelitis. This readout is expected in the first quarter of 2025.

About BiomX

SAN ANTONIO, TX, March 25, 2025 /24-7PressRelease/ -- Robert S. Jones, EdD, has been selected for inclusion in Marquis Who's Who. As in all Marquis Who's Who biographical volumes, individuals profiled are selected on the basis of current reference value. Factors such as position, noteworthy accomplishments, visibility, and prominence in a field are all taken into account during the selection process.

Dr. Jones, an esteemed education and training consultant with the Defense Health Agency, has dedicated his career to advancing healthcare education systems and implementing Lean Six Sigma methodologies. His expertise in these areas has been instrumental in reducing costs and improving patient outcomes across military healthcare facilities. Dr. Jones's role involves training staff, aligning educational materials with current healthcare practices and collaborating with experts to ensure that training programs meet industry standards. His efforts have significantly enhanced the quality of care within the military healthcare system.

Dr. Jones's professional journey began with a 22-year career in the United States Army, where he retired as a senior enlisted advisor in 2006. Following his retirement, he served as a medical simulation consultant at Brooke Army Medical Center from 2006 to 2009, managing simulation training for medical residents and hospital staff. This role allowed him to ensure that all training sessions were supported by high-tech simulation equipment, facilitating the practice of essential medical skills and procedures.

In 2009, Dr. Jones transitioned to educational and development director for the U.S. Army, serving until 2023. During this time, he was most proud of his work as a licensed practical nurse program training administrator. He collaborated with nursing staff to enhance the curriculum, resulting in improved student pass rates and a significant increase in national licensure exam success rates. His leadership and dedication to improving healthcare systems within the military were further demonstrated through his publications on effective training methodologies.

Dr. Jones's academic achievements have played a crucial role in his career success. He holds an EdD specializing in adult education from Capella University, earned in 2021, and a postgraduate degree in educational leadership and administration from the same institution. His academic background also includes a Master of Education in instructional leadership from Wayland Baptist University, which he earned in 2011, and a Bachelor of Science in occupational education with honors, which he received in 2009. These academic accomplishments have equipped him with the knowledge and skills necessary to excel in his field.

Beyond his professional endeavors, Dr. Jones is actively involved in civic organizations as a volunteer medical practitioner for local school districts and a mentor to aspiring professionals. His contributions to military medicine are highlighted by awards such as the Meritorious Service Medal and Combat Ribbons from the Gulf War. Additionally, he has co-authored publications on nursing education and contributed to simulation and healthcare education literature.

In his personal life, Dr. Jones enjoys golfing, spending time with friends and meeting new people. Born in Jacksonville, he attributes much of his success to the support of his wife, Kriss, a nurse practitioner, and their daughter, Taliah. Looking ahead, he aims to advance military healthcare by collaborating with colleagues to enhance care reliability within the system. He is committed to reducing costs, minimizing errors and improving patient outcomes while fostering better communication and patient care processes. Dr. Jones also aspires to publish research or articles to share his insights and contributions to the field, further supporting military healthcare practices through executive leadership certification initiatives.

The Fort Carson Intrepid Spirit Center, or ISC, is a state-of-the-art treatment facility dedicated to the assessment and care of concussions and other forms of brain Injuries.

“As part of the Defense Intrepid Network, the Intrepid Spirit Center provides comprehensive care and support for service members, veterans, and their families who have experienced traumatic brain injuries,” said U.S. Public Health Service Cmdr. Steve Spoonemore, a board-certified orthopedic clinical specialist and physical therapist with the Fort Carson ISC. “Our primary mission is getting service members back to duty in order to maintain an effective fighting force.”

Spoonemore says that many of the symptoms with traumatic brain injury are difficult to see externally yet impact the ability for service members to function in their military and family roles.

“The team-based care model helps us identify the associated symptoms of TBI, address them in comprehensive way, and empower the service member and family with tools to maintain optimum capability,” Spoonemore said.

Dr Brian Kelly, the deputy director of the ISC, says that these ""invisible injuries"" often go unrecognized, making events like this crucial.

“The military is deeply committed to addressing brain injuries to enhance warfighter readiness and improve quality of life during and after military service,” Kelly said. “The brain plays a vital role in numerous functions, from mood to memory to marksmanship. Just as soldiers once sharpened their swords for battle, we strive to ensure today's service members have sharp minds, free from symptoms.”

Kelly says that treatment at the ISC is highly individualized based on patient needs and goals. Services provided often include medication management, physical therapy, occupational therapy, neuropsychology, speech and cognitive rehabilitation, art therapy, and music therapy.

The ISC also sees other TRICARE beneficiary categories, to include family members and retirees.

Various TriCare Aged Care Residence locations offer Respite Care services.","Discover how Respite Care can support caregivers and provide quality care for your loved one while you take a well-deserved break.

Taking a break from caregiving is not just important – it’s essential. Respite Care provides temporary support for your loved one while giving you the time to rest and recharge. In this guide, we walk you through how Respite Care works, what to expect, and how to arrange it with TriCare.

Understanding Respite Care

Respite Care is short-term, temporary care designed to give primary caregivers a break from their caregiving duties. It ensures that your loved one continues to receive high-quality support while you take time to rest, attend to personal matters, or simply recharge. This temporary care can be arranged for various durations, from a few hours to several weeks, depending on your needs and those of your loved one.

Overcoming guilt: taking a break is more than okay

We understand that making the decision to arrange Respite Care can be emotional. Many caregivers feel guilty about taking a break, especially if their loved one is reluctant to stay in an Aged Care Residence. However, it’s important to recognise that self-care is a crucial part of being an effective caregiver. By ensuring you are well-rested and supported, you can provide better care in the long run.

Respite Care also provides a beneficial experience for your loved one. A change of environment, opportunities for social interaction, and engaging activities can contribute to improved wellbeing. In many cases, residents enjoy their stay so much that they choose to return for future respite periods – or even transition to Permanent aged Care when the time is right.

The benefits of Respite Care in summary

Respite Care isn’t just beneficial for caregivers – it also provides real advantages for seniors.

For seniors:

Offers lots of new social engagement and companionship

Provides a fresh change of routine and new activities

Can help with recovery after illness or surgery

For caregivers:

Reduces stress and prevents burnout

Provides time to focus on personal needs

Allows for uninterrupted rest and relaxation

How the Respite Care process works

Step 1: Recognise the need for a break

As previously mentioned caregiver burnout is real, and it’s okay to acknowledge that you need support. If you’re feeling physically exhausted, emotionally drained, or struggling to balance your responsibilities, it may be time to consider Respite Care.

Step 2: Understand the types of Respite Care

At TriCare we offer residential Respite Care at various locations, where your loved one can stay for a short period. During their stay, they will receive 24-hour nursing care, access to engaging social activities, and support with daily living tasks in a safe and comfortable environment.

Other service providers may provide in-home Respite Care, if that’s more ideal for you. You can find those by searching for in-home Respite Care in your local area.

Step 3: Arrange an ACAT assessment if you haven’t already

To access government-subsidised Respite Care in Australia, your loved one will need an assessment from the Aged Care Assessment Team (ACAT). This free assessment determines their eligibility and level of care required.

How to apply: Contact My Aged Care [link: https://www.myagedcare.gov.au/assessment] at 1800 200 422 or apply online.

What to expect: An ACAT assessor will visit your home to evaluate your loved one’s physical, psychological, medical, and social needs. The process typically takes 1-3 hours.

Step 4: Choose a TriCare Aged Care Residence

Once your ACAT assessment is complete, we invite you to explore our Respite Care options. You can:

Visit our TriCare Aged Care Residential Respite Care page [link: https://www.tricare.com.au/aged-care/care-options/respite-care] for more details.

Then book a tour of one of our Aged Care Residences that provides Respite Care to meet our team and see the environment first-hand.

Step 5: Prepare for your loved one’s stay

Once you’ve chosen a residence, it’s time to prepare for your loved one’s respite stay. Here’s what you need to do:

Submit required documentation: We’ll guide you through the paperwork, including you providing your ACAT approval and medical records.

Pack personal belongings: Ensure your loved one has their essentials, such as clothing, toiletries, medications, and any comfort items that will help them feel more at home.

Communicate preferences: Share any specific care instructions with our team so we can personalise their experience.

Step 6: The Respite Care stay

During your loved one’s stay, they will be warmly welcomed by our experienced team and supported with:

Comfortable accommodation
