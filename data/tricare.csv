MMR/V Surveillance in the Military Health System

A surveillance report evaluated measles, mumps, rubella, and varicella (MMR/V) among service members and other beneficiaries of the U.S. Military Health System (MHS) from 2019 through 2024. Investigators queried the Defense Medical Surveillance System to identify both confirmed and possible MMR/V cases during the six-year period.

Across all MHS beneficiaries, the total counts included 8 confirmed and 71 possible measles cases, 18 confirmed and 193 possible mumps cases, 13 confirmed and 265 possible rubella cases, and 251 confirmed and 4,554 possible varicella cases. Over the surveillance window, the report described decreasing numbers of confirmed and possible cases for all four infections.

Measles, Mumps, Rubella, and Varicella Case Patterns

Varicella accounted for the largest number of reported infections in this dataset, including both confirmed and possible cases. Measles case counts were low overall, and the authors reported that no measles cases were observed among U.S. service members during the surveillance period.

The report also described vaccination status among service members with MMR/V. Most service member cases were reported as either partially vaccinated, or having vaccination records that were not available in the queried data. The authors noted that MMR/V cases decreased over time and highlighted continued vaccination against MMR/V as a factor in limiting morbidity among U.S. service members, pointing to lower case counts in service members, who are required to be vaccinated, compared with non-service members.

Long story short, I recently found out I am pregnant & when I made my OB/GYN appointments I learned that I was actually never enrolled in Tricare. Open season ended over a month ago & I have been incredibly stressed out since I learned that I have zero health insurance.

We submitted a ""request to enroll outside of the enrollment period"" but I have been told it can take up to 45 days to receive an answer. In the meantime, I cannot avoid getting ultrasounds and going to the doctor. If we pay up front & Tricare agrees to enroll late, then they will cover these bills retroactively (and likely reimburse us), which would be amazing. However, in the event they deny our request, we will be back at square one, sans insurance, and left with bills we cannot afford.

Lawmakers in Congress have introduced new legislation aimed at fixing a complex system that has many times prevented Airmen serving on Air National Guard and Reserve duty status from getting the same benefits as their Active-duty counterparts.

The bipartisan Duty-Status Reform Act—sponsored by Reps Gil Cisneros (D-Calif.) and Jack Bergman (R-Mich)—would streamline the number of Guard and Reserve duty statuses from 30 to just four main categories, a move that former Air National Guard Director Lt. Gen. Michael A. Loh said could be the “game-changer” needed to fix an overly complicated management system that often shortchanges Guard and Reserve members of benefits such as Tricare.

“To finally have the congressional sponsorship of duty-status reform is absolutely awesome,” Loh, now retired, told Air & Space Forces Magazine. “It’s absolutely necessary for our Guard and Reserve.”

Loh has been long-time advocate for streamlining the dozens of duty-statuses that Guard and Reserve members are placed on for taskings ranging from drill weekends to disaster-relief missions. On top of that are mobilizations to support real-world missions like Operation Midnight Hammer, the bombing raid on Iran’s nuclear sites, and Operation Absolute Resolve, the recent mission to capture Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro.

“This gets hugely complicated,” Loh said, adding that there have been past attempts to push duty-status reform legislation through Congress, but efforts have never gotten this far.

The 30 separate duty statuses in place currently are the “result of patch fixes done by Congress spanning from World War II to the Global War on Terror,” according to a fact sheet on the legislation.

“The current framework is confusing, difficult to administer, and results in unnecessary administrative burdens,” the document states. “Most importantly, it fails to provide equitable benefits and does not align with the needs of our Guard and Reserve units.”

The four proposed duty status categories in the act are:

Category I: Contingency Duty that involves missions such as military operations and national emergencies such as natural disasters. This also covers post-deployment activities.

Category II: Training and Support activities that include required training, administrative assignments and other support missions.

Category III: Reserve Component Duty Blocks of time that involve partial-day duty and are dedicated to readiness training and support to prepare individuals and units to be ready for future use and mobilization. This category would include training periods, flight training, administrative activities, and support activities such as funeral honors support.

Category IV: Remote Assignments that involve online learning and individually assigned duties that are completed virtually.

“Efforts to simplify the complex duty status system began over two decades ago. We owe it to our service members to deliver this much-needed change and ensure they are receiving equitable pay and benefits,” Cisneros, a Navy veteran and former Under Secretary of Defense for Personnel and Readiness, said in a news release on the effort. “This was my number one priority returning to Congress. Having worked on this issue during my time at the Pentagon, I learned about the complexity of the current duty status system and how it hurts our readiness and quality of life for service members.”

To Loh, the Guard and Reserve members suffer the “biggest pain point” when they have to change from one status to another on back-to-back assignments such as ordering a Reservist to transition from training to support a real-world operation.

“They changed from one status to another, so it would kick them off in Tricare,” Loh said. “They could be deployed, doing this over in Europe, the Middle East, or somewhere in the Pacific, and the next thing you they’re getting calls from their family saying ‘Hey, I just got a medical bill, and they said we didn’t have Tricare.”

Bergman said the proposed legislation is a “common sense win” for Guard and Reserve members.

“It cuts through decades of red tape to make sure those who serve get consistent benefits, clear orders, and the support they’ve earned—whether they’re responding to disasters at home or missions abroad,” Bergman, a retired Marine Corps lieutenant general and former commander of Marine Forces Reserve, said in the release.

The bill is endorsed by a number of service associations that support the Guard and Reserve.

Retired Army Maj. Gen. Francis McGinn, president of the National Guard Association, praised the proposed legislation as a “long overdue step forward for our force and the nation.”

Miliary Officers Association of America Director Jimmy Santos, who has served in the Air Force, the Air National Guard, and now the Air Force Reserve, pointed out that the reform act also “simplifies the Pentagon’s access to the Reserve Forces, helping maintain mission readiness and enhancing force posture.”

Loh made a similar point by saying he has spent “painstaking hours” trying to explain the different duty statuses of the Guard and Reserve to Active-duty commanders to ensure they have the right mix personnel for a particular mission.

“It would be so confusing, they didn’t understand,” Loh said.

To Loh, making it easier to access the Guard and Reserve is critical to maintaining force readiness. “The way you increase readiness is you make a much more simplistic system on how you access approximately 40 percent of the force because we need a Guard member that’s ready to go and that doesn’t have to think about what type of status they’re on or what benefits their family members going to get,” Loh said. “We need them to focus on the mission.

Shield is covered by Medicare and the Veterans Affairs Community Care Network, and is commercially available across the U.S. About Shield Shield is a non-invasive, blood-based screening test that detects alterations associated with colorectal cancer in the blood.
The Shield test can be considered in a manner similar to guideline-recommended non-invasive CRC screening options and can be completed during any healthcare visit.
A positive Shield result raises concern for the presence of colorectal cancer or advanced adenoma and the patient should be referred for colonoscopy evaluation.
About Guardant Health Guardant Health is a leading precision oncology company focused on guarding wellness and giving every person more time free from cancer.","Active-duty service members and eligible family members in Florida now have access to blood test for colorectal cancer screening with no copay

January 8, 2026— Guardant Health, Inc. (Nasdaq: GH), a leading precision oncology company, today announced its Shield blood test for colorectal cancer screening (CRC) is now covered for active-duty service members and their families, including in Florida, through TRICARE, the U.S. military’s health insurance coverage, with no copay for average-risk individuals ages 45 and older.

Shield is the first and only blood test approved by the FDA as a primary screening option for CRC, offering U.S. military troops in Florida a more pleasant and convenient option for screening by overcoming barriers associated with other screening methods. According to the Department of Defense, there are approximately 1.3 million active-duty service members in the U.S. Those above the age of 45 – along with their families of screening-eligible age – will now have access to Shield, the latest innovation in CRC screening.

“Continuing to expand coverage for Shield across the U.S. from our nation’s veterans to our active-duty service members will help provide greater access to Shield’s life-saving screening benefit from just a blood draw,” said AmirAli Talasaz, Guardant Health co-CEO. “TRICARE has a long history of bringing the most impactful technologies at the forefront of science to support our troops in being proactive about their healthcare. We’re proud to see Shield selected as a primary screening option for colorectal cancer to empower those who serve to catch cancer early when it’s more treatable.”

TRICARE coverage for Shield is a game-changer for the 60,442 active-duty service members living in Florida and their families who now have access to a more convenient way to get screened.

Colorectal cancer (CRC) is the second leading cause of cancer-related death in Florida. The American Cancer Society estimated that 12,330 Floridians would be diagnosed with CRC in 2025 alone, and 3,970 would die from the disease. The five-year survival rate for CRC is 91% if caught early. Shield is covered by Medicare and the Veterans Affairs Community Care Network, and is commercially available across the U.S.

About Shield

Shield is a non-invasive, blood-based screening test that detects alterations associated with colorectal cancer in the blood. It is intended as a screening test for individuals at average risk for the disease, age 45 or older, and is not intended for individuals at high risk for colorectal cancer. The Shield test can be considered in a manner similar to guideline-recommended non-invasive CRC screening options and can be completed during any healthcare visit. A positive Shield result raises concern for the presence of colorectal cancer or advanced adenoma and the patient should be referred for colonoscopy evaluation.

Senator Marshall has worked for more than a year with local, state, and federal leaders to protect Irwin Army Community Hospital’s mission and ensure it remains fully equipped to serve both soldiers and Kansas veterans.

“Fort Riley’s hospital is not just a critical piece of readiness for our soldiers — it’s also a lifeline for families and veterans across the Flint Hills,” said Senator Marshall. “For months, I’ve pushed back on any effort to downgrade services here and fought to bring more resources to this hospital. This upcoming agreement will help ensure veterans can access the care they’ve earned, close to home, while strengthening Fort Riley’s medical mission.”

Senator Marshall’s visit comes after months of advocacy and coordination with the Defense Health Agency (DHA) and Department of Veterans Affairs (VA), following reports that the hospital could be downgraded to an acute care clinic — threatening emergency, surgical, and maternity care options in the North Central Flint Hills Region.

During a Fort Riley visit last summer, DHA leadership emphasized their commitment to strengthening IACH’s future and keeping the hospital at full capacity.

“My goal is to figure out how I can make IACH even more successful,” said Acting DHA Director Dr. Stephen Ferrara during the visit. “To me, the definition of success for a hospital is a busy hospital doing high volume, high complexity care.”

Background:

Irwin Army Community Hospital provides emergency services, surgical care, and delivery services critical to the Fort Riley community and the broader region. One proposed solution to strengthen staffing and sustain hospital services is an agreement between Fort Riley and the VA to allow more than 17,000 veterans in the North Central Flint Hills Region to access care at Fort Riley.

Senator Marshall’s Advocacy for Fort Riley and Kansas Veterans:

January 10, 2025: Senator Marshall sent a letter to the Defense Health Agency demanding answers after reports that Irwin Army Community Hospital could be downgraded to an acute care clinic.

April 7, 2025: Senator Marshall raised concerns directly with Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth and received assurances regarding Fort Riley’s hospital mission.

May 9, 2025: Senator Marshall met with Fort Riley’s Commanding General, who emphasized the hospital was the installation’s top concern.

May 14, 2025: Senator Marshall spoke with Acting DHA Director Dr. Stephen Ferrara, resulting in DHA agreeing to conduct an on-site assessment.

June 4, 2025: DHA staff conducted a pre-visit assessment and concluded that the North Central Flint Hills region has fewer care options than expected.

June 30, 2025: DHA and the Assistant Secretary of Defense for Health Affairs visited Fort Riley and provided preliminary guidance supporting full emergency, surgical, and maternity services. DHA also acknowledged staffing shortages and discussed potential partnerships with VA to expand access and strengthen services.

July 7, 2025: Senator Marshall spoke with VA Secretary Doug Collins to advance an agreement connecting Fort Riley with VA services in Kansas.

July 9, 2025: Senator Marshall joined Senator Moran and Representative Schmidt in a meeting with the Assistant Secretary of Defense for Health Affairs to reinforce Kansas’s need for a fully operational hospital at Fort Riley.

Keyonica Lassiter, a Defense Health Agency employee with the U.S. Public Health Service, received the DAISY Award for Extraordinary Nurse Leaders Dec. 11 at Defense Health Headquarters in Falls Church, Virginia. The award recognizes those who pair clinical excellence with compassion and strong leadership.

In her role as chief of the DHA’s health delivery capabilities branch within the capability requirements management division, Lassiter leads interagency teams managing 75 projects across the Military Health System to improve access, equity, and readiness for service members, veterans, and their families.

Lassiter’s work “exemplifies nursing leadership through her transformative impact on professional practice, advocacy, and mentorship,” wrote Cheryl Ann Kraft, DHA capability portfolio manager, in her nomination of Lassiter. “Her ability to amplify nursing voices in high-level decision-making ensures frontline perspectives shape solutions across the Department of War.”

The DAISY Award — which stands for Diseases Attacking the Immune System — was established in 1999 by the family of J. Patrick Barnes after he died from complications of an autoimmune disease. Moved by the care he received from nurses, his family established the program to honor the skill and kindness nurses bring to patients every day. In 2025, more than 5,800 health care facilities and schools of nursing in all 50 states and 38 countries and territories take part.

“The DAISY Award is a special, internationally recognized honor,” said Cmdr. Carissa Haney, special assistant to the chief nurse officer, USPHS. “It is given to extraordinary nurses for the compassionate contributions they make every day, going above and beyond expectations in science and sensitivity.”

She noted that within the USPHS, the award is highly competitive, with only three nurses selected for recognition from the 30 to 50 nominees received each quarter. “She did not win this lightly,” said Haney. “It really is a testament to her work.”

Lassiter’s nomination highlighted her focus on workforce well-being and growth, aligning her leadership with the U.S. surgeon general’s Framework for Workplace Mental Health and Well-Being. The award also honored her mentorship of junior officers and more than 300 interagency staff members, fostering connections and professional development across teams.

“She champions opportunities for nurses through national training programs, guiding DHA development of nursing training requirements and capability-building initiatives,” said Kraft. “Her work in behavioral health, HIV/AIDS care, and trauma-informed practices ensures dignity and meaning in clinical practice.”

Lassiter revived development opportunities for her staff by securing funding, travel, and continuing education credits for events such as the 2025 Defense Health Information Technology Symposium, the 2025 Military Health System Research Symposium, and the 4th Annual AI for Defense Summit.

DHA leaders said the award reflects both Lassiter’s accomplishments and the example she sets. “Keyonica is a fantastic asset to DHA,” said Michael Swayze, DHA chief of the capability requirements management division.

Capt. Danilo Garcia-Duenas, deputy assistant director of operations in DHA's Office of Operations, Plans, Education and Training said, “This is a very prestigious award at this level for the USPHS, and we are so grateful for having her on our staff and being able to recognize her in this way.”

As part of the recognition, Lassiter received a certificate, a DAISY pin, and a stone sculpture called “The Healer’s Touch.”

She expressed gratitude for the renowned recognition: “Thank you to the DAISY Foundation. Thank you for encouraging me.”

Recognizing Swayze’s guidance, Lassiter said, “You have been so supportive from the day that I walked in.” She highlighted the opportunity to urge other USPHS officers to consider assignments with the DHA.

“To anybody listening in the USPHS: Please come here,” she said. “DHA looks out for their people. I’m so thankful for the work I’ve been able to be a part of. It’s been tough, but I’m excited.”",https://dha.mil/-/media/Project/Images/News-Images/9472825.jpg,N,0.0,2026-01-10 03:56:43.332603

Mark Loftis, 38, of Cushing, Oklahoma, was the owner of a medical supply company called Back Pain Home Supplies LLC, which did business as EZ Medical Supply. As alleged, Loftis paid illegal kickbacks to marketers in exchange for the referral of Medicare patients, and to marketers and telemedicine companies in exchange for signed doctors’ orders that could be used to support claims to health care benefit programs. The telemedicine providers did not engage in meaningful evaluation of the patients before signing the orders. Loftis allegedly caused Back Pain to bill Medicare, TRICARE and CHAMPVA for DME that was medically unnecessary, obtained through the payment of illegal kickbacks, and not provided as billed. In total, Back Pain submitted about $30 million in false and fraudulent claims, for which the three health care programs paid about $8 million.

Loftis converted the money he received from the Provider Relief Fund (PRF) for his own use and the use of others, pursuant to the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act. PRF funds were appropriated to help healthcare providers financially impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic, as well as to provide care to patients suffering from COVID-19 and compensate providers for the cost of that care. As alleged, Loftis received more than $133,000 in PRF funds and then falsely attested to a series of conditions to retain the funds, including that he would use the funds for health care expenses and to replace revenue lost due to the pandemic. In reality, Loftis used a portion of the funds to further the DME fraud scheme and for a variety of personal expenses.

Loftis is charged with one count of conspiracy to commit health care fraud and wire fraud, one count of conspiracy to defraud the United States and to offer, pay, solicit, and receive kickbacks, and two counts of theft of government property. If convicted, he faces a maximum penalty of 20 years in prison on the health care and wire fraud conspiracy count, five years in prison on the conspiracy and kickback count, and 10 years in prison on each of the theft of government property counts. A federal judge will determine any sentence after considering the U.S. Sentencing Guidelines and other statutory factors.

I’m pregnant, FTM and recently had routine prenatal genetic carrier screening done through my OB’s office (blood was already drawn and sent to the lab). I’m on TRICARE Select.

After the draw, I received a prior authorization denial from TRICARE saying the testing was denied for “failure to establish medical necessity.” However, when I log into my TRICARE portal, the claim is still listed as “in progress” and I have no EOB yet. But I saw an amount for almost $6000!

What’s confusing is that I personally know other patients at the same OB practice, with TRICARE Select, no high-risk pregnancy or family history, who had the same genetic testing done and it was approved and covered, they didn’t have to pay out of pocket.

The lab used for mine was NxGen MDx (through my OB). I’ve been told the OB has to handle prior auth / appeals, not the front desk billing team.

I’m trying to understand:

• Has anyone had TRICARE deny the prior authorization but show the claim as in progress and still end up paying? • Did anyone have this reversed after the OB resubmitted or appealed? • Did you end up with a self-pay cap, write-off, or full insurance payment?

I’m not trying to get out of something I shouldn’t have. I just want to understand why identical patients at the same OB with the same insurance get different outcomes, and what actually happens next in real life.

Any experiences (good or bad) with TRICARE + prenatal genetic testing would really help. Thanks!",,N,0.0,2026-01-09 17:56:37.874632

“We’ve seen a significant nationwide drop in blood donations during December and January,” said Col. Christopher Evans, Army Blood Program director. “Because blood products have a natural expiration date, we can’t stockpile indefinitely to cover this gap. To solve this, the Army Blood Program has designated Fort Leonard Wood as the West winter blood collection hub. We are conducting this targeted drive to aggressively counter the winter slump and ensure our supply chain remains unbroken heading into the new year.""

Blood will flow from 7 a.m. to 6 p.m. daily and all military units on Fort Leonard Wood, government civilian employees and Tricare beneficiaries in the local community are asked to give.

Donated blood helps service members and their families throughout the Department of War have a better chance of winning their battle against illness and injury.

Blood donors must weigh at least 116 pounds, be at least 17 years old and have been feeling well for at least three days before the drive. They must also be well hydrated and have eaten something before donating. Those wanting to donate should know what foreign countries they’ve traveled to in the past 12 months and bring a photo ID with them to verify eligibility.

Fort Leonard Wood Regulation 690-12, Civilian Personnel Leave Administration, encourages government employees to donate blood and grants excused absence for the time necessary to do so as well as recuperate afterwards and travel to and from the donation site. The maximum excused absence can’t exceed four hours, and supervisor coordination is required.

“Having an ample blood supply available for combatant commanders and special operations forces is a must to keep our forces fit to fight,” Evans said. “We’re thankful we can surge resources at Fort Leonard Wood to meet mission requirements effectively, leveraging our trainee and permanent party populations to save lives.""

Maj. Gen. Christopher Beck, Maneuver Support Center of Excellence and Fort Leonard Wood commanding general, said he’s excited to accept this challenge and show everyone the post’s compassion.

“Currently, the Department of War’s blood inventories are below optimal levels and we need to do all we can to replenish those critical supplies,” he said. “At Fort Leonard Wood, we’re committed to supporting the medical needs of our military community and uphold the values of service and sacrifice. The Armed Services Blood Program enables high-quality care for Department of War beneficiaries, ultimately enhancing the readiness and resilience of our forces.”

Evans said failing to collect the required units at the winter drive is not an option.

""If we do not meet these goals, we place an immediate strain on our military treatment facilities and contingency blood supplies globally,” Evans said. “Failure here creates a gap in coverage that could impact wounded warriors downrange.”

While many early cancer detection tests are highly sensitive, their performance in early stage breast cancer lags behind other types of cancer.
""We're measuring and teasing out this unique fingerprint that breast cancer leaves in the presence of the immune system,"" he said.
In a clinical study testing 1,500 patients — 144 of whom had cancer — Onco-ID Breast was able to detect breast cancer in 97 percent of stage I and stage II patients.
It also intends to work with corporate healthcare plans that have shown interest in utilizing innovative screening modalities for early cancer detection, Lozuk said.","NEW YORK – Liquid biopsy firm Syantra has taken another step forward toward commercialization with the launch of a new study it intends to use for clinical implementation of its early breast cancer detection test.

The Onco-ID Breast assay is a multi-target whole-blood mRNA test that is intended for use as a screening tool for women with elevated risk of breast cancer. The University of Calgary spinout announced last month that it is partnering with Vincere Cancer Center on a clinical trial to support clinical implementation and market access for the test.

The multicenter study, led by Weill Cornell Medicine in collaboration with the University of Calgary, will include 2,000 women ages 30 to 75 with an elevated risk of developing breast cancer and will focus particularly on women with dense breasts, which makes detection through mammography difficult. Breast cancer screening for such women is particularly difficult because mammography is ""horribly inefficient"" in dense breast tissue, Syantra CEO Rob Lozuk noted in an interview.

Syantra's Onco-ID platform does not rely on cell-free or circulating tumor DNA like many other liquid biopsy tests, Lozuk said, because cfDNA and ctDNA alone are not sensitive enough for early detection of breast cancer. While many early cancer detection tests are highly sensitive, their performance in early stage breast cancer lags behind other types of cancer.

Syantra, in contrast, is looking at the immune system's response to the presence of cancer, specifically epigenetic shifts that happen early in cancer, in whole blood. The firm's platform measures the regulation of selected biomarkers that are generally associated with the immune system, which allows it ""to look very early into the process"" and detect cancer, Lozuk said.

""We're measuring and teasing out this unique fingerprint that breast cancer leaves in the presence of the immune system,"" he said.

Vershalee Shukla, a radiation oncologist and cofounder of Vincere Cancer Center who is helping with Syantra's multicenter study, noted that breast cancer is hard to detect through liquid biopsy because the tumor doesn't shed much in the blood. While imaging does a ""good job"" of picking up ductal carcinoma in situ, it also has a high rate of false positives, resulting in patients undergoing unnecessary biopsies.

Shukla said she's optimistic Syantra's technology can help reduce those false positives and ensure women who have dense breast tissue are adequately screened.

The firm's technology was first developed in the laboratory of Tina Rinker, a biomedical engineering professor at the University of Calgary and Syantra's cofounder, when the team used its previous cell-based discovery work to inform breast cancer biomarker discovery more than a decade ago. Funding for that project enabled her team to develop the concept that the Onco-ID technology is based on.

Syantra researchers used clinical samples to develop a prototype test, and began international prospective clinical studies in 2018, Rinker said. The team then identified a panel of transcripts specific to the early detection of breast cancer and the development of predictive models informed by machine learning algorithms. These components form the basis of Onco-ID, which uses qPCR to return a result that says whether the patient is recommended for either follow-up imaging or continued routine screening.

The company's test uses off-the-shelf components for everything except the plate, the chemistry, and its software, Lozuk added. The assay can be run by standard laboratory personnel, and Syantra is currently validating its analytic software, Rinker said.

In a clinical study testing 1,500 patients — 144 of whom had cancer — Onco-ID Breast was able to detect breast cancer in 97 percent of stage I and stage II patients.

The company is currently completing that study, which is expected to finish at the end of the first quarter of 2026 and plans to begin early access commercial pilot programs at multiple sites at the start of Q2 targeting women with dense breast tissue, Lozuk said. Syantra plans to publish the results of its clinical study in a peer-reviewed paper early in Q2, he added.

The firm has also submitted a health economic study to a peer-reviewed publication to make the economic argument for its test and the benefits, he said, adding the company is working to roll out a clinical utility study early this year.

Rinker noted that the company plans to continue running studies on other indicated at-risk populations to strengthen its validation and secure additional reimbursement. It also intends to work with corporate healthcare plans that have shown interest in utilizing innovative screening modalities for early cancer detection, Lozuk said.

The firm's goal is not to commercialize the test itself, but to work with commercial partners to ""take it to the masses,"" he added. While it will make ""nominal"" commercialization efforts in Canada, throughout the rest of the world Syantra intends to use existing companies' infrastructure to ensure access to the test.

Three primary models will be used for commercialization, Lozuk said. One will be test send-out agreements with certain laboratories where Syantra will perform the assay as a laboratory-developed test in its CLIA-certified lab, another approach will involve licensing the technology to other large players in the diagnostic industry, and the final model will be limited direct commercialization in Canada.

""We want to be an innovation center of excellence that enables the most rapid introduction of our methodology to the market, Lozuk said.

Vincere's Shukla said the test's ultimate goal is to help with screening but said she also could see the test having a role in diagnostics to determine whether something found on a mammogram needs to be biopsied or for minimal residual disease detection.

Thus far, Syantra has done preliminary work in lung and pancreatic cancer to show that the ""fingerprint"" it is detecting exists and is unique in each cancer type, he added.

Lozuk also noted that if the firm's technology garners interest from another company looking to acquire one of its tests, it would be interested in selling the technology while continuing development of its other assays.

Syantra recently finished a funding round last fall that raised $7.3 million to ensure its operations will continue through this year and plans to raise an additional $10 million to $20 million in a Series B round to commercialize the breast cancer test, finish development of the lung cancer assay, and make ""meaningful progress"" on the pancreatic cancer assay, Lozuk said.",https://crain-platform-360dx-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/app-icons/favicon.ico,N,0.0,2026-01-09 11:56:43.123240

Keyonica Lassiter, a Defense Health Agency employee with the U.S. Public Health Service, received the DAISY Award for Extraordinary Nurse Leaders Dec. 11 at Defense Health Headquarters in Falls Church, Virginia. The award recognizes those who pair clinical excellence with compassion and strong leadership.

In her role as chief of the DHA’s health delivery capabilities branch within the capability requirements management division, Lassiter leads interagency teams managing 75 projects across the Military Health System to improve access, equity, and readiness for service members, veterans, and their families.

Lassiter’s work “exemplifies nursing leadership through her transformative impact on professional practice, advocacy, and mentorship,” wrote Cheryl Ann Kraft, DHA capability portfolio manager, in her nomination of Lassiter. “Her ability to amplify nursing voices in high-level decision-making ensures frontline perspectives shape solutions across the Department of War.”

The DAISY Award — which stands for Diseases Attacking the Immune System — was established in 1999 by the family of J. Patrick Barnes after he died from complications of an autoimmune disease. Moved by the care he received from nurses, his family established the program to honor the skill and kindness nurses bring to patients every day. In 2025, more than 5,800 health care facilities and schools of nursing in all 50 states and 38 countries and territories take part.

“The DAISY Award is a special, internationally recognized honor,” said Cmdr. Carissa Haney, special assistant to the chief nurse officer, USPHS. “It is given to extraordinary nurses for the compassionate contributions they make every day, going above and beyond expectations in science and sensitivity.”

She noted that within the USPHS, the award is highly competitive, with only three nurses selected for recognition from the 30 to 50 nominees received each quarter.

“She did not win this lightly,” said Haney. “It really is a testament to her work.”

Lassiter’s nomination highlighted her focus on workforce well-being and growth, aligning her leadership with the U.S. surgeon general’s Framework for Workplace Mental Health and Well-Being. The award also honored her mentorship of junior officers and more than 300 interagency staff members, fostering connections and professional development across teams.

“She champions opportunities for nurses through national training programs, guiding DHA development of nursing training requirements and capability-building initiatives,” said Kraft. “Her work in behavioral health, HIV/AIDS care, and trauma-informed practices ensures dignity and meaning in clinical practice.”

Lassiter revived development opportunities for her staff by securing funding, travel, and continuing education credits for events such as the 2025 Defense Health Information Technology Symposium, the 2025 Military Health System Research Symposium, and the 4th Annual AI for Defense Summit.

DHA leaders said the award reflects both Lassiter’s accomplishments and the example she sets.

“Keyonica is a fantastic asset to DHA,” said Michael Swayze, DHA chief of the capability requirements management division.

Capt. Danilo Garcia-Duenas, deputy assistant director of operations in DHA's Office of Operations, Plans, Education and Training said, “This is a very prestigious award at this level for the USPHS, and we are so grateful for having her on our staff and being able to recognize her in this way.”

As part of the recognition, Lassiter received a certificate, a DAISY pin, and a stone sculpture called “The Healer’s Touch.”

She expressed gratitude for the renowned recognition: “Thank you to the DAISY Foundation. Thank you for encouraging me.”

Recognizing Swayze’s guidance, Lassiter said, “You have been so supportive from the day that I walked in.” She highlighted the opportunity to urge other USPHS officers to consider assignments with the DHA.

“To anybody listening in the USPHS: Please come here,” she said. “DHA looks out for their people. I’m so thankful for the work I’ve been able to be a part of. It’s been tough, but I’m excited.”",https://d1ldvf68ux039x.cloudfront.net/thumbs/photos/2601/9472825/1000w_q95.jpg,N,0.0,2026-01-09 10:57:13.575603

Another one-year delay is also a possibility if Congress does not pass the RESULTS Act.
This scoring change could also make the RESULTS Act more attractive to Congress in comparison.
Because CBO has previously scored permanent PAMA reform bills as costing money but temporary bills as saving money, it has made permanent reform a more difficult lift.","NEW YORK – Congress took up discussion of permanent reform of the Protecting Access to Medicare Act (PAMA) Thursday in a move that clinical lab industry stakeholders suggested was a promising sign for the prospects of the Reforming and Enhancing Sustainable Updates to Laboratory Testing Services (RESULTS) Act.

The bill, which aims to reform PAMA by using a third-party database of private payor claims to establish Medicare payment rates for laboratory tests, was one of several pieces of healthcare legislation considered during a hearing by the Health Subcommittee of the House of Representatives' Energy & Commerce (E&C) Committee.

Susan Van Meter, president of the American Clinical Lab Association (ACLA), which has been one of the bill's most prominent advocates, told 360Dx that the subcommittee's consideration of the bill was ""a huge milestone,"" noting that such hearings are typically ""a necessary part of the legislative process to move [a] bill forward.""

Van Meter, who spoke as a witness at the subcommittee hearing, suggested that the inclusion of the RESULTS Act among the bills discussed indicated it is a priority for the E&C Committee.

""We do think that being part of a legislative hearing is clearly signaling the committee's prioritization of getting PAMA reform done,"" she said.

Introduced in September, the RESULTS Act would significantly revamp the process for establishing Medicare reimbursement rates for lab testing to address the challenge of obtaining representative private payor lab reimbursement data, an issue that has hampered implementation of PAMA from the beginning.

The bill has substantial bipartisan support, with 58 cosponsors in the House and four cosponsors in the Senate, but it is uncertain whether it is a high enough priority for lawmakers to be included in any larger legislative vehicle, as would likely be necessary for it to pass. The bill's inclusion in the Thursday subcommittee hearing is an encouraging sign in that regard.

PAMA was originally scheduled to go into effect at the beginning of 2026. The continuing resolution recently passed by Congress to fund the federal government through the end of January included a one-month delay pushing PAMA implementation off through the end of January. If no action is taken in coming weeks, however, reimbursement cuts and price reporting requirements under the law will go into effect at the beginning of February.

Among the legislators to discuss the RESULTS Act during the hearing were Reps Gus Bilirakis, R-Fla., John Joyce, R-Pa., Troy Balderson, R-Ohio, and Thomas Kean, R-N.J., all cosponsors of the bill. All spoke supportively of the bill, raising concerns that in its current form, PAMA could limit patient access to lab testing and hamper innovation within the diagnostics industry.

House members including Balderson and Rep. Erin Houchin, R-Ind. specifically highlighted concerns that PAMA has negatively impacted laboratories serving rural areas and patient access in those communities.

Rep. Jay Obernolte, D-Calif., the former chair of the House task force on AI, raised the issue of AI-related innovations and their applications to the lab space, saying that ""of all the applications of AI, really the low-hanging fruit, the way it can most immediately contribute to the well-being of people is through the healthcare space and certainly the lab space, as well.""

Kean, in his comments and questions to Van Meter, also noted that if PAMA were to go into effect at the beginning of February as currently scheduled, the US Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) would be setting test prices based on private payor rates reported seven years ago, the last time lab price data was collected under the law.

This is because for the last six years Congress has passed a series of one-year delays putting off PAMA implementation. The statute has not been otherwise updated, however, meaning pricing will still be set based on 2019 data.

Another one-year delay is also a possibility if Congress does not pass the RESULTS Act. However, changes in how the Congressional Budge Office (CBO) scores the financial impact of such a temporary delay could make such legislation more difficult to pass than in previous years.

CBO has previously scored temporary PAMA delays as cost savings, which has made them an attractive option for Congress as those savings could then be used to offset other spending. The office scored the recent one-month delay, however, as costing $49 million over 10 years.

This scoring change could also make the RESULTS Act more attractive to Congress in comparison. Because CBO has previously scored permanent PAMA reform bills as costing money but temporary bills as saving money, it has made permanent reform a more difficult lift.",https://crain-platform-360dx-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/styles/1200x630/s3/AdobeStock_926841666.jpeg,N,0.0,2026-01-09 11:56:49.034557

Unlike other arms of the military, the Marines pride themselves on consistently hitting their enlistment goals. But that mission is becoming increasingly difficult despite an overall upswing in military recruitment.

From old-school methods feeling outdated to a dwindling birth rate, recruiters who are already stretched to the limit are facing more challenges, writes BI's Kelsey Baker.

It's the final installment in Kelsey's fascinating four-part investigation into the Marine Corps recruiting practices that are ""burning Marines,"" according to one Great Plains sergeant. She spoke to nearly four dozen recruiters and officials and obtained documents from a Marine Corps investigation and two Marine Corps Inspector General reports.

Kelsey's reporting found Marine Corps recruiters face an unusual degree of depression, emotional stress, and elevated risks of divorce, with 15 apparent suicides between 2015 and 2024.

Some of the challenges Marine recruiters face will sound familiar to anyone in sales.

They have a quota (enlisting two people a month) and deal with frustrating tracking tools that can slow down the process (Military Health System Genesis).

It's one thing to try to get an executive to buy some software, but it's another convincing a high schooler to sign an enlistment contract.

The situation can even become hostile, with three recruiters telling Kelsey they had guns pulled on them when visiting homes of potential enlistees.

In some cases, the pressure to meet targets led recruiters to falsify records and forge signatures. It's an issue that didn't just impact the rank-and-file recruiters, but higher-ups in the Marine Corps, as well.

The Marine Corps told Kelsey in a statement that the overwhelming majority of recruiters complete their tours successfully. ""We are not yet where we ultimately want to be,"" the service said. ""But trends are undeniably moving in the right direction.""

With today’s overly complex, burdensome duty status system, servicemembers doing similar jobs often receive different benefits due to the sheer number of duty statuses.
“The Duty Status Reform Act is a commonsense win for our Reserve and National Guard servicemembers,” said Bergman.
I’m proud to support this modernization effort to strengthen readiness and reduce bureaucracy.” “Efforts to simplify the complex duty status system began over two decades ago.
I am proud to introduce this bipartisan legislation with Rep. Bergman, who knows firsthand the issues with the current structure, and I look forward to working with the Administration and my colleagues in Congress on this critical reform.” “Duty Status Reform is a long overdue step forward for our force and the nation.","WASHINGTON DC – On Thursday, Congressmen Jack Bergman (MI-01) and Gil Cisneros (CA-31) introduced the bipartisan Duty Status Reform Act which would reduce the Reserve Component’s (RC’s) duty statuses from roughly 30 to four.

This change would create a coherent structure, ensuring our servicemembers receive equitable benefits and pay when called to service.

The legislation is cosponsored by Reps, Ted Lieu (CA-36) and Sam Graves (MO-6).

The bill is endorsed by the National Guard Association of the United States (NGAUS), Reserve Organization of America (ROA), Enlisted Association of the National Guard of the United States (EANGUS), and Military Officers Association of America (MOAA).

With today’s overly complex, burdensome duty status system, servicemembers doing similar jobs often receive different benefits due to the sheer number of duty statuses. This construct has created major disparities for troop pay and benefits like TRICARE and the Post-9/11 GI Bill.

Under the new duty statuses established in this bill, servicemembers carrying out assignments within the same category will receive the same pay and benefits package.

“The Duty Status Reform Act is a commonsense win for our Reserve and National Guard servicemembers,” said Bergman. “It cuts through decades of red tape to make sure those who serve get consistent benefits, clear orders, and the support they’ve earned – whether they’re responding to disasters at home or missions abroad. I’m proud to support this modernization effort to strengthen readiness and reduce bureaucracy.”

“Efforts to simplify the complex duty status system began over two decades ago. We owe it to our servicemembers to deliver this much-needed change and ensure they are receiving equitable pay and benefits,” said Cisneros. “This was my number one priority returning to Congress. Having worked on this issue during my time at the Pentagon, I learned about the complexity of the current duty status system and how it hurts our readiness and quality of life for servicemembers. I am proud to introduce this bipartisan legislation with Rep. Bergman, who knows firsthand the issues with the current structure, and I look forward to working with the Administration and my colleagues in Congress on this critical reform.”

“Duty Status Reform is a long overdue step forward for our force and the nation. The National Guard has protected the homeland for nearly four centuries. As our tempo of operations has increased, it requires increased accessibility and flexibility,” said Major General (retired) Francis McGinn, president of NGAUS. “This legislation streamlines an overly complex system of over 30 duty statuses into four categories, cleans up nearly 300 laws, saves taxpayer dollars, and requires no additional scoring. We are grateful to Congressmen Cisneros and Bergman for leading this charge and we look forward to working with Congress to accomplish this much needed reform.”

“This is a great step forward for the eight hundred thousand plus men and women of the Reserve Components,” Command Sergeant Major (retired) John D. Gipe, Executive Director of EANGUS “Duty Status Reform has been a topic of discussion and studies for over fifteen years. Finally, with the help of Representatives Cisneros and Bergman, this important modernization of the laws that support our Servicemembers and their Families is moving forward. Our Warriors will finally get the benefits they deserve for performing their service in uniform. The Soldiers and Airmen of the National Guard, along with their Reserve counterparts, are grateful to all who have had a hand in bringing this issue to the forefront.”

“Duty Status Reform replaces a burdensome maze of statutory authorities governing reserve service with a clear, predictable framework, allowing the military to operate faster and directly tying service to defined pay and benefit entitlements,” said Major General (retired) John Hashem, CEO of ROA. “It ensures uniform benefit accrual, reduces record disputes, and delivers equal DoD/W and VA benefits for identical service.”

“This legislation addressing Duty Status Reform simplifies the Pentagon’s access to the Reserve Forces helping maintain mission readiness and enhancing force posture,” said Jimmy Santos, Director of MOAA. “For servicemembers in the Reserve, it guarantees equal delivery of benefits to include healthcare and the housing allowance.”",https://ogden_images.s3.amazonaws.com/www.thealpenanews.com/images/2022/10/09200626/bergman-WEB-667x500.jpg,N,0.0,2026-01-09 08:56:53.738339

To better support this readiness posture, the clinic is now equipped to handle complex procedures that were previously outsourced.

“They've been referring out a lot of procedures: root canals, implants, wisdom teeth,” said U.S. Air Force Capt. Thomas Hardison, Maxwell Medical Group comprehensive dentist. “And so being here and having the training to do those procedures brought a lot of care back in-house.”

The dental flight’s role is critical in clearing Airmen for deployment, often requiring the team to react with urgency to meet short-notice mission requirements.

“When patients are deploying, we ensure that they are ready to go. If they do have things that are limiting them from going, we will stop what we're doing to get them out the door,” said U.S. Air Force Tech. Sgt. Ernessie Ladouceur, Maxwell Medical Group dental flight chief.

While bringing back sedation capabilities has been the most recent focus at the clinic, there are several types of procedures the flight also aims to bring back.

“We'll do implants, sinus lifts, ridge augmentation, and other periodontal surgeries,” said Hardison.

Modernization has been a key component of the clinic's enhanced capabilities, with a renewed focus on digital dentistry. This shift reduces chair time for patients and improves the precision of care through advanced technology.

“We have two 3D printers up and running now,” said Hardison. “We do most everything digitally now. So, we scan everything, 3D print models, and mill restorations.”

Keeping these advanced procedures within the military health system provides a direct benefit to the patient by ensuring all their medical information is centralized and accessible.

“I think the impact is the continuity of care. More patients are being able to have their care here with us and not seeing a provider off base,” said Ladouceur. “It’s one less thing they have to worry about.”

The flight’s core function is ensuring every Airman is medically prepared for global operations.

“The unit's overall mission is to make sure that our active-duty members are able to be fit and ready,” said Ladouceur. “So that way when they're out there, they're not having to worry about something like a toothache.”","https://www.montgomeryadvertiser.com/gcdn/authoring/authoring-images/2026/01/01/PMOY/87981865007-251009-fuq-9301378.jpg?crop=6047,3402,x0,y0&width=3200&height=1801&format=pjpg&auto=webp",N,0.0,2026-01-09 08:56:59.662217

The defense health agency data platform is changing how the U.S. military delivers healthcare to 9.6 million beneficiaries worldwide. Here’s what you need to know:

Key Components:

MHS Information Platform (MIP) – The largest secondary repository of health data in the DoD, consolidating over 1 petabyte of data from 35+ sources

MHS GENESIS – The modernized electronic health record system replacing fragmented legacy systems

Common Data Model – Standardizes health data vocabulary across all systems for seamless interoperability

Operation Helios – The largest data migration in DHA history, moving 30 years of health records into a unified platform

Primary Goals:

Enable real-time, data-driven clinical decisions

Support military readiness through predictive analytics

Eliminate data silos across 164,000 daily patient encounters

Prepare infrastructure for AI/ML adoption

Ensure secure, compliant data governance (HIPAA, FISMA)

For decades, military healthcare relied on disconnected systems—53 inpatient platforms, 140 outpatient systems, and hundreds of business intelligence tools scattered across the globe. This fragmentation meant providers couldn’t access complete patient histories. Service members carried paper records. Critical health data sat trapped in silos while decisions waited.

That era is ending. Through strategic modernization initiatives like the Military Health System Information Platform (MIP) and the deployment of MHS GENESIS, the Defense Health Agency is building a unified, secure, and intelligent data ecosystem. The goal isn’t just better technology—it’s better outcomes. Faster care. Lives saved.

I’m Maria Chatzou Dunford, CEO and Co-founder of Lifebit, where we’ve spent over a decade building federated data platforms that enable secure, real-time analytics across complex healthcare ecosystems. Our work with public sector institutions mirrors many of the challenges the defense health agency data platform addresses—breaking down data silos, enabling AI-ready infrastructure, and ensuring compliance without sacrificing speed or collaboration.

The primary goal driving the Defense Health Agency’s (DHA) data platform change is nothing less than enhancing military readiness, boosting operational effectiveness, and ensuring patient safety. Imagine a world where every service member, veteran, and their family receives seamless, personalized care, no matter where they are or when they need it. This vision is being realized by changing raw data into a strategic, trusted asset.

From Chaos to Clarity: Breaking Down Data Barriers

For too long, the military health system wrestled with data silos – a hidden threat to both care and readiness. Before the current change, the DHA grappled with “a hodgepodge of older, distributed systems” from the 1990s, including 53 instances of inpatient systems and 140 outpatient systems. This fragmentation meant that health authorities and contractors would often stay up late trying to gather and coordinate information from 451 military treatment facilities. This disconnected approach led to inefficiencies, duplicate efforts, and a lack of a comprehensive patient view.

Our experience building federated data platforms for governments and public health agencies in the UK, Canada, Singapore, and across Europe has shown us that this fragmentation isn’t unique to any single system. It’s a common pain point that demands a strategic response.

The modernization mandate for DHA is clear and urgent. The COVID-19 pandemic, for instance, significantly accelerated the need for modernized data platforms in military medicine, highlighting the critical importance of rapid data access for decision-makers. The DHA’s 2023 Strategic Plan outlines a clear path towards an “agile, data-driven, virtual-first, human-centered model of care.” This ambitious plan aims to support wartime skills, clinical currency, medical readiness requirements at a global scale, and deliver value- and outcome-based care.

This strategic plan is also building a crucial foundation for AI and advanced analytics. The DHA is actively preparing its data infrastructure to effectively support and leverage cutting-edge technologies like Artificial Intelligence (AI), Machine Learning (ML), Natural Language Processing (NLP), and Optical Character Recognition (OCR). A modernized data platform, as described by experts, allows decision-makers to work faster and enables AI to augment their work, turning complex data into actionable insights.

The Key Players and Their Roles

A change of this magnitude requires dedicated leadership and specialized teams. At the helm of the DHA is Lt. Gen. Telita Crosland, who serves as the director, overseeing nine medical centers, 36 hospitals, 525 clinics, and 138 dental facilities worldwide, serving 9.6 million beneficiaries. Under her guidance, the DHA’s data strategy is firmly aligned with the broader Department of Defense (DoD) Data Strategy and AI readiness roadmap.

The Enterprise Intelligence and Data Solutions (EIDS) Program Management Office (PMO) plays a pivotal role in this change. EIDS manages the Military Health System Information Platform (MIP), which is the largest secondary repository of health-related data in the DoD. EIDS offers five core capabilities: Legacy Data Consolidation, Workflow Application, Information Portal, Analytics Workbench, and a Data Science Laboratory.

Other key Program Management Offices (PEOs) driving this integration include the Program Executive Office (PEO) for Medical Systems, which is an acquisition organization attached to the DHA. This office is responsible for acquiring and delivering healthcare technology. The DHMSM PMO oversees the deployment and sustainment of MHS GENESIS, while the Joint Operational Medicine Information Systems (JOMIS) PMO develops and sustains IT systems for deployed forces. These PEOs are instrumental in delivering digitally centered health care to warfighters around the world, ensuring that the necessary technologies are in place and functioning effectively.

Inside the Defense Health Agency Data Platform

At the heart of the DHA’s data strategy is the Military Health System Information Platform (MIP). This platform represents a monumental leap forward in consolidating and managing vast amounts of healthcare data. The MIP is not just a storage facility; it’s a dynamic system designed to make data accessible and actionable.

The MHS Information Platform (MIP): DHA’s Data Powerhouse

The scale of the MIP is truly staggering. Through a strategic modernization initiative known as Operation Helios, the DHA has completed what’s been called the largest data standardization and migration operation in its history. This involved moving over 1 petabyte of data, which is a mind-boggling one quadrillion bytes, or one million gigabytes. This massive undertaking, executed in carefully planned phases, consolidated data from over 35 disparate sources, including the Armed Forces Health Longitudinal Technology Application (AHLTA), the Composite Health Care System (CHCS), and Essentris®, as well as various ancillary pharmacy, lab, and radiology systems. The process involved complex Extract, Transform, and Load (ETL) pipelines built to handle the unique formats and structures of each legacy system. Hosted on a secure government cloud environment, these pipelines performed intensive data validation and cleansing before loading the information into the MIP, processing an astounding 60 billion records annually.

This isn’t just about moving data; it’s about changing it into a powerful tool for analytics. Previously, analysts would spend up to 80% of their time simply trying to find, access, and merge data from separate repositories like the MHS Data Repository (MDR) and MHS Mart (M2), often with conflicting or incomplete results. Now, the MIP lays the essential groundwork for advanced data analytics capabilities, including big data analysis, Natural Language Processing (NLP), visualizations, and semantic analysis. This means we can move from simply storing information to actively leveraging it for real-world impact, providing seamless data services and decision support for clinicians, patients, beneficiaries, analysts, researchers, and DoD leadership.

By creating a single source of truth, the MIP is designed to eliminate redundant data, reduce operational costs, and significantly improve the provider experience. This consolidation is a critical step towards a more efficient and effective military health system.

Standardizing the Language of Health: The Common Data Model

Imagine trying to understand medical records from different hospitals, each using their own unique terms for the same condition. It would be a nightmare! This is why data standardization is the backbone of interoperability, and why the DHA’s adoption of a Common Data Model (CDM) is so crucial.

The DHA’s Strategic Plan for fiscal years 2023-2028 emphasizes the adoption of a CDM to standardize data definitions. For example, a diagnosis of “obstructive sleep apnea” might have been recorded in one legacy system using an ICD-9 code (327.23), in another as free text in a clinical note, and in MHS GENESIS with an ICD-10 code (G47.33). The OMOP CDM, through standardized vocabularies like SNOMED CT, maps all these variations to a single, unambiguous concept ID. This allows researchers to query for “all patients with obstructive sleep apnea” and receive a complete, accurate cohort without needing to understand the idiosyncrasies of dozens of legacy systems. This vocabulary standardization is vital for enabling seamless care and research. Our experience shows that a standardized vocabulary is foundational for any effective federated data platform, allowing disparate datasets to speak the same language.

The DHA is leveraging the Observational Medical Outcomes Partnership (OMOP) common data model, a widely adopted standard developed through a public-private collaboration. The choice of OMOP was strategic, driven by its robust open-source toolset, strong international community support via the Observational Health Data Sciences and Informatics (OHDSI) community, and its design for enabling large-scale observational research—a key goal for the DHA. This community, boasting over 2,000 collaborators across 74 countries and health records for about 810 million unique patients, provides invaluable guidance and tools.

This standardization effort directly benefits patient care and military readiness by leading to more reliable diagnoses and treatment. It also streamlines research by enabling faster integration of data, even across international partners. Interoperability with other federal agencies, such as the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), becomes a reality. The VA, in fact, is undergoing a similar initiative, and the close collaboration on CDM mapping is not just about technical alignment; it aims to enable joint research on health issues affecting both populations, such as traumatic brain injury (TBI) and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), and to create a foundation for a truly seamless lifetime health record for service members as they transition to veteran status.

Governance and Security: Building Trust in Every Byte

In the complex world of military healthcare, data isn’t just information; it’s a matter of national security and individual well-being. Therefore, robust governance and uncompromising security are paramount. Our work with governments and public health agencies across the UK, Europe, Canada, and Singapore underscores the critical importance of these pillars in any successful data platform.

Federated Governance: Secure Collaboration Without Centralization

The DHA aims to create a unified, secure, intelligent, and compliant data ecosystem without centralizing data into a single platform. This is a nuanced but powerful approach, embracing a decentralized data model. This strategy is about empowering domain experts and maintaining data sovereignty, allowing data to reside where it is generated while still being accessible for analysis.

The DHA is utilizing a prototype data mesh architecture to modernize its enterprise data infrastructure, supporting domain-driven data ownership and federated governance. This approach aligns perfectly with our philosophy at Lifebit, where our federated AI platform enables secure collaboration across hybrid data ecosystems without ever moving sensitive data. It means data can be exchanged and analyzed securely, preserving privacy and ensuring that control remains with the data owners. This is particularly vital for national defense, where data sovereignty is a non-negotiable requirement.

Protecting Patient Data: Compliance and Security in Action

Protecting patient data is not just a best practice; it’s a legal and ethical imperative. The DHA’s data framework is built to meet the highest standards of regulatory compliance, including the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA), and protecting Personally Identifiable Information (PII) and Protected Health Information (PHI). Given the military context, compliance also extends to the Federal Information Security Modernization Act (FISMA) and other stringent DoD cybersecurity requirements.

These protections are implemented through multiple layers:

Access Controls: Rigorous role-based access control (RBAC) ensures that only authorized personnel can access specific data elements. As seen in the VA’s Health Data and Analytics Platform (HDAP), access is carefully managed and monitored.

Encryption: Data is encrypted both at rest and in transit, safeguarding it from unauthorized access during storage and transmission.

Auditing: Comprehensive auditing and logging mechanisms track all data access and activity, providing an immutable record for accountability and compliance checks.

Continuous Monitoring and Risk Management: The DHA implements robust risk management measures and continuous monitoring to identify and mitigate potential vulnerabilities proactively. The VA’s HDAP, for instance, undergoes regular risk reviews and maintains a FIPS 199 classification of MODERATE, indicating a strong security posture.

Formalizing data stewardship and lifecycle management is also a critical component, with clear roles, responsibilities, and accountability for data ownership established across the enterprise. This holistic approach ensures that every byte of data is handled with the utmost care and integrity.

The Future Is Now: AI, Analytics, and Real-World Impact

The change of the defense health agency data platform isn’t just about organizing existing data; it’s about releaseing its full potential through advanced technologies. The future of military healthcare is being shaped by AI, ML, and sophisticated analytics, turning data into actionable insights that save lives and improve care.

AI in Action: Changing Military Readiness and Patient Care

The DHA is actively preparing its data infrastructure to support and leverage advanced technologies like AI, ML, and NLP. This preparation lays the foundation for future data analytics capabilities, including big data analysis, advanced visualizations, and semantic analysis. Our experience building AI-driven platforms for large-scale biomedical research demonstrates that clean, harmonized data is the fuel for these powerful engines.

Augmented Decision-Making for Clinicians and Commanders: A modernized data platform allows decision-makers to work faster and enables AI to augment their work. This means clinicians can make more informed diagnoses and treatment plans, while commanders have a clearer common operating picture to make critical operational decisions. This “augmented leadership decision-making” is a direct benefit of the data change.

Predictive Health: Stopping Problems Before They Start: The ability to leverage predictive analytics means anticipating needs and preventing crises. By analyzing vast datasets, the system can identify patterns and risks, helping clinicians “head off costly medical situations” before they escalate. This proactive approach shifts healthcare from reactive to preventive.

Operational Triage: Prioritizing Care When Seconds Count: In high-stress environments, seconds count. Integrated medical systems can deliver critical information needed for health and injury concerns, providing predictive analytics and machine teaming to “save lives and improve operational triage.” This ensures that the right care is delivered to the right person at the right time.

Personalized Medicine: Tailoring Care to Every Service Member: The DHA is shifting from a “one-size-fits-all approach to a personalized healthcare experience” for service members and veterans. Integrating clinical and genomic data, as we do in our platforms, is crucial for personalized medicine and accelerated research translation. This allows for tailoring care to every individual, optimizing outcomes based on their unique health profile.

Real Benefits for Service Members and Veterans

This data change translates into tangible benefits for service members, veterans, and their families:

Longitudinal Patient Records: Seamless Care Across Deployments: With a unified system, service members no longer have to carry paper medical records. Instead, a “longitudinal patient record” ensures that all relevant data is available to providers, regardless of where the care is delivered—whether in the US, Germany, or Korea. This drastically improves continuity of care across deployments and transitions.

Proactive Healthcare: From Reactive to Preventive: The ability to use predictive analysis means healthcare can be more proactive, identifying potential issues before they become major problems. This leads to better long-term health outcomes.

Reduced Paperwork, Improved Safety, Family Health Support: Digitization promises to boost efficiency by reducing the burden of paperwork. With comprehensive data, patient safety is improved through more informed decisions. Furthermore, the goal is to provide a “digital front door” for patients, allowing self-service tasks like prescription refills, appointment scheduling, and secure communication, extending support to families as well.

Challenges and the Road Ahead

Changing an organization as vast and complex as the DHA is no small feat. We’ve seen similar challenges in our work with large-scale government and public health initiatives globally. The road ahead for the defense health agency data platform involves navigating several significant problems.

Overcoming Problems: How DHA Is Building a Resilient Data Platform

Data Quality: Cleaning Up Decades of Legacy Data: One of the most significant challenges is ensuring data quality. Migrating over 1 petabyte of data, including 30 years of MHS data from legacy systems like the MHS Data Repository (MDR) and MHS Mart (M2), inevitably involves tackling inconsistencies and ensuring accuracy. This process involves more than just mapping fields; it requires sophisticated algorithms for patient de-duplication to create a single “golden record” for each beneficiary who may have been registered multiple times across different facilities over 30 years. Automated data quality rules are run continuously to flag anomalies, such as illogical dates or out-of-range lab values, while teams of data stewards manually curate and correct critical data elements. The accuracy of this historical data is paramount for longitudinal studies and predictive modeling.

Cultural Shift: Training and Change Management: Technology adoption is as much about people as it is about platforms. There’s a need for a “cultural shift at the speed of relevance for patients,” acknowledging that users vary widely in their readiness for digital tools. To manage this, the DHA has implemented a multi-faceted change management strategy. This includes role-based training modules for clinicians, nurses, administrators, and researchers, ensuring each user group understands how the new tools impact their specific workflows. Furthermore, a network of “clinical champions” and super-users has been established at military treatment facilities worldwide. These individuals receive advanced training and act as on-the-ground peer leaders, advocating for the new system, providing immediate support, and channeling user feedback directly to the program offices to drive iterative improvements.

Legacy System Integration: Bridging Old and New: The DHA has had to replace a “hodgepodge” of older systems, consolidating disparate networks into a unified system and implementing MHS GENESIS. The challenge lies in seamlessly integrating these new platforms with remaining legacy systems during the transition, ensuring that historical data is accessible and future data flows smoothly without interruption to clinical care. This requires building and maintaining a complex web of interfaces and application programming interfaces (APIs) that can bridge the gap between modern, cloud-native applications and decades-old mainframe systems until the latter can be fully and safely decommissioned.

User Adoption: Making the Platform Work for Everyone: With over 20,000 users impacted by these changes, minimizing disruption and ensuring that the new platform is intuitive and beneficial is crucial for successful user adoption. The feedback loops created through the clinical champion network are vital for this, allowing for rapid adjustments to user interfaces and workflows based on real-world use.

Scalability: Preparing for Tomorrow’s Demands: The data infrastructure must be resilient and scalable to handle ever-increasing volumes of data and new technological demands, especially as AI and ML capabilities expand. Our federated cloud-native architectures are designed specifically for this kind of future-proofing, ensuring platforms can grow with demand.

Tackling technical debt and legacy complexity has required a monumental effort. The DHA’s “Desktop to Datacenter” program, for example, consolidated separate Army, Navy, and DHA Medical networks into one unified network with a single help desk. Aligning stakeholders and securing funding has also been critical, involving extensive collaboration across multiple program offices, military hospitals, clinics, and global leaders.

Finally, inter-agency collaboration is breaking down bureaucratic barriers. The close partnership with the VA on data standardization, for instance, ensures interoperability and common approaches. This collaboration is formalized through joint working groups and leverages the Federal Health Information Exchange (HIE) to enable bidirectional data sharing. The ultimate goal is a more integrated federal health ecosystem where a service member’s complete health record is securely and seamlessly available to VA providers the day they transition to veteran status, eliminating dangerous gaps in care and the administrative burden on the individual.

Conclusion The 2026 TRICARE updates reinforce a familiar reality for therapy practices.","2026 has officially begun, bringing new updates across the healthcare industry, particularly within TRICARE. These annual updates are designed to align coverage, costs, and care delivery with federal guidelines and evolving healthcare needs.

For 2026, TRICARE has introduced meaningful changes related to cost structures, coverage expansion, and care supervision. They directly influence reimbursement, patient access, compliance requirements, and billing workflows.

Staying informed is essential for therapy providers. Understanding these changes early helps practices adapt smoothly, reduce administrative disruptions, and continue delivering consistent care to TRICARE beneficiaries.

This blog outlines the key TRICARE updates for 2026, including industry-wide and regional changes, while focusing on how they impact therapy specialties.

What’s New in TRICARE for 2026?

In 2026, TRICARE introduced several updates affecting plan costs, pharmacy benefits, regional plan administration, and expanded medical coverage. While not all changes directly alter therapy services, they influence overall patient costs, access patterns, and admin conversations within therapy practices.

Industry-Wide Updates and Benefit Changes

Increased Plan Costs: Most TRICARE plan costs, including enrollment fees, deductibles, copayments, and premiums, increased modestly for 2026, generally aligning with annual retiree COLA adjustments.

Pharmacy Copayment Changes: For most beneficiaries using retail network pharmacies and home delivery services, pharmacy copayments have increased with variations across formulary tiers.

Expanded Medical Coverage: TRICARE implemented routine coverage updates for 2026, including formulary adjustments and alignment with updated clinical guidelines. These changes are administrative and clinical refinements, not major benefit expansions, and have minimal direct impact on therapy services.

Please note that these medical coverage updates do not change eligibility or reimbursement rules for ABA, PT, OT, or speech therapy services.

Regional Updates

New TRICARE Prime Competitive Plans Demonstration: Beginning January 1, 2026, eligible beneficiaries in select ZIP codes within metro Atlanta, GA, and Tampa, FL, can enroll in a new TRICARE Prime option managed by CareSource Military & Veterans (CSMV).

Enrollment Flexibility Update: TRICARE previously used temporary waivers allowing some beneficiaries to remain enrolled after certain relocations. These flexibilities have now ended, and standard Prime access rules apply.

For detailed TRICARE health plan cost information, beneficiaries should refer directly to the official TRICARE website.

How 2026 TRICARE Updates Impact Therapy Specialties?

TRICARE updates affect multiple areas of the healthcare system, including therapy services such as ABA, physical therapy, speech therapy, and occupational therapy. While coverage structures remain largely intact, several operational and access-related changes influence how therapy services are delivered and reimbursed.

Expanded Virtual Care: Telehealth and virtual care remain a permanent part of TRICARE coverage, whenever clinically appropriate and allowed by benefit rules.

Provider Network Stability Concerns: Some therapy practices reported unpaid claims and credentialing challenges following the 2025 transition to new regional contractors. This can affect continuity of care as providers exit networks, especially in the West Region under TriWest Healthcare Alliance. Therapists must regularly update their information with regional contractions (Humana Military for East, TriWest for West), to avoid payment delays.

Autism Care Demonstration (ACD): ABA remains covered under the Demonstration and has not yet been transitioned into a basic TRICARE benefit. Providers must continue meeting all compliance and documentation requirements to maintain coverage and reimbursement.

What do These Changes Mean for Therapy Practices?

While the 2026 TRICARE updates do not significantly alter therapy benefit structures, they introduce operational challenges. Changes in costs, regional administration, and referral workflows require therapy practices to focus on accuracy, oversight, and clear communication across clinical and administrative teams.

Some of the key operational impacts include:

Increased Billing Complexity: Annual cost adjustments, regional contractor workflows, and ongoing specialty-specific requirements make TRICARE billing complex.

Higher Claim Denial Risks: Even minor issues in eligibility verification, referrals, or authorizations can result in delayed or denied claims under TRICARE.

Eligibility and Authorization Errors: Inaccurate DEERS information, outdated referrals, or missed authorization renewals for programs like ACD can disrupt care and reimbursement.

Greater Patient Inquiries About Costs and Coverage: Rising copayments and plan cost changes often lead to increased questions from beneficiaries, placing additional demands on front-desk and billing teams.

For therapy practices, it’s essential to stay ahead of these operational impacts by implementing proactive systems and consistent verification processes. Additionally, they can improve performance by gaining clear visibility into patient eligibility, authorizations, and claims status.
