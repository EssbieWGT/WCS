The federal government should do the same. Now that I’m in the Senate, my team and I are here to help Nebraskans navigate the bureaucracy.

We have offices in Scottsbluff, Kearney, Lincoln, Omaha, and Washington, D.C. We also host Mobile Office Hours across the state. We have already visited all 93 counties this year and we visited them all twice last year. Our team is specially trained in assisting constituents with concerns and complaints. We can also answer questions about services, eligibility, or benefits from federal agencies like the Veterans Affairs, Medicare, or the Internal Revenue Service. I’m proud of our work to cut red tape and deliver wins for Nebraskans.

In 2024, we helped nearly 800 Nebraskans access federal services. We also helped constituents save or recover nearly $5 million from the federal government. We continue that work this year and have already returned $1.3 million in constituent savings for Nebraskans.

Richard out in the Panhandle is one example. He’s a disabled veteran. His disability requires him to get significant help for everyday tasks, like going through his mail. Late last year, the VA notified Richard that he owed nearly $20,000. This was because his dependent status had not been updated since 2015. Richard was shocked by this, as he had never been informed an update was needed. That’s because his VA notices had been inadvertently thrown away without his awareness.

Richard contacted my office in Lincoln after trying for months to submit the needed paperwork. This disabled veteran had no way of repaying this debt that he accidentally incurred. My team got involved and helped establish a claim. The VA updated his dependent status which wiped away Richard’s debt, saving him nearly $20,000.

A couple from Dodge County contacted my office asking for help. They always file their taxes on paper. In 2023, the IRS made a big mistake and said they owed over $34,000. Not only did these Nebraskans not owe money, but they were due a refund of over $25,000. The IRS then refused to pay their 2022 refund because of the mix-up.

This couple tried to fix it themselves. They sent letters asking for help and got no response. They even met with the IRS in Omaha. When they came to my office for help, our casework team got to work immediately. We found the IRS’s mistakes and showed them they were wrong.

Soon after that, the Nebraskans finally got a refund check for over $22,000. That included almost $1,500 in interest—which still wasn’t the right amount. After more hard work, we helped them get another check. In the end, the Dodge County couple received the money they were owed. It took more than a year, but we never gave up.

Other times, oversight means ensuring Nebraska companies are not overlooked on federal directories. A healthcare provider in Eastern Nebraska reached out to my office. They are an in-network provider for TRICARE. TRICARE is the health care program that serves our military members, veterans, and their families. However, TRICARE’s website failed to list this provider as an acceptable option.

That simple omission caused serious confusion. Patients didn’t know they could get care from this provider. As a result, this provider faced an estimated $150,000 in lost revenue.

My team reached out to TriWest, a contractor who manages TRICARE’s network in our region. We pushed them to fix the website and ensure this provider was listed correctly. Thanks to our efforts, the problem was resolved. The VA website was updated.

Now, military families and veterans who are TRICARE beneficiaries can see this proud Nebraska company listed as a trusted, in-network provider. That’s not just a win for this provider. It’s a win for every Nebraskan who depends on clear information and quality care.

These are just three of many examples of how my team and I work every day to help Nebraskans navigate the federal bureaucracy. We’re continuing the fight to protect taxpayer dollars and ensure federal agencies serve the people. From streamlining government to cutting taxes on Social Security, tips, and military retirement benefits, I’ll keep working to make government work better. We’re going to continue delivering excellent customer service for our constituents.

This form is part of the reporting requirements established by the Affordable Care Act (ACA). For TRICARE beneficiaries, this document confirms their enrollment in a plan that satisfies national health coverage standards.

Understanding Your TRICARE 1095-B

The purpose of Form 1095-B is to serve as proof that you maintained Minimum Essential Coverage (MEC), a standard set by the Affordable Care Act. While the ACA originally included a federal tax penalty for not having health insurance, this penalty was reduced to $0 starting with the 2019 tax year. You no longer face a federal penalty for lacking coverage, but the Department of Defense continues to send these forms to fulfill its legal obligation to report health coverage information to the IRS and to plan enrollees.

Your TRICARE 1095-B contains specific details about your coverage. Part I identifies the “Responsible Individual,” which is the plan subscriber or sponsor. Part III names the issuer of the coverage, which for TRICARE is the Department of Defense Manpower Data Center (DMDC). Part IV lists each covered individual by name and Social Security number and includes checkboxes to indicate for which months of the year they had MEC.

This form is for retirees, annuitants, former spouses, and others covered by TRICARE Select, TRICARE Retired Reserve, TRICARE Reserve Select, and TRICARE Young Adult. Active-duty members and their families, as well as those enrolled in TRICARE Prime, receive a Form 1095-C. If a service member retires or separates during the year, they may receive both a 1095-C for their active-duty period and a 1095-B for their months as a retiree.

Tax Filing with Form 1095-B

When filing your federal income taxes, you do not need to attach Form 1095-B to your return. The IRS receives this information directly from the DMDC. You should, however, keep the form with your personal tax records as proof of coverage.

The relevance of Form 1095-B is more pronounced at the state level. While the federal penalty no longer exists, a handful of states have enacted their own individual health coverage mandates. These states require residents to have qualifying health coverage or pay a penalty on their state tax return.

Residents of the following jurisdictions may need the information from their 1095-B to complete their state tax forms and demonstrate they met the coverage requirement:

California

District of Columbia

Massachusetts

New Jersey

Rhode Island

Vermont

The information on your TRICARE 1095-B, particularly the months of coverage detailed in Part IV, is what you would use to satisfy these obligations and avoid a potential state-level penalty.

How to Access Your Form 1095-B

The most direct way to get your Form 1095-B is through the milConnect online portal. After logging in with a DS Logon, Common Access Card (CAC), or DFAS myPay account, you can navigate to the “Correspondence/Documentation” section to view, print, or save a PDF copy of your form. Forms are available by January 31 for the preceding tax year.

If you are unable to access the form online, you can request a copy by phone. You may call the Defense Manpower Data Center (DMDC) Support Center to ask for a copy to be mailed to your address on record. Having your sponsor’s Social Security number available when you call can help expedite the request.

A third option is to request the form via postal mail. You can send a written request to the DMDC Support Office. The request should include the sponsor’s full name, Social Security number, date of birth, and the tax year for which you need the form. This method is the slowest, so it is best to submit the request well in advance of any tax filing deadlines.",https://accountinginsights.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/cropped-ai6icon.png,N,0.0,2025-06-28 18:56:24.436056

You don't say but I'm assuming you are medically retired for your cap to be $3000? If not then your Group A cap $4261. If you ARE medically retired, all other fees go by Select Group A costs. So you would have a $150 individual deductible and a $300 family deductible you would need to meet before costsharing begins. Costsharing is another word for copayments.

Lets look at what Select Retired Group A says under Maternity Inpatient: Network: $250 per day or up to 25% hospital charge (whichever is less); plus 20% separately billed services

Out-of-Network: $1,306 per day§ or up to 25% hospital charge (whichever is less); plus 25% separately billed services

So you would then figure if you went to an in- network or out-of-network hospital.

Unlock your health—and peace of mind—by understanding how TFL and Medicare work together, as described in the Medicare publication How Medicare Works With Other Insurance.","JUNE 28, 2025 – Are you approaching the age of 65? Unlock your health by signing up for Medicare as soon as you’re eligible. Medicare Part A and Part B are required to remain eligible for TRICARE, with limited exceptions. Knowing how and when to sign up for Medicare will help you avoid gaps in coverage and late enrollment penalties.

“Signing up for Medicare three or four months before your 65th birthday is important to ensure a seamless transition to TRICARE For Life,” said Anne Breslin, TFL program manager, TRICARE Health Plan, at the Defense Health Agency. “Medicare and TRICARE will then work together to help minimize your out-of-pocket expenses.”

Understanding eligibility

Most people become eligible for Medicare the first day of the month they turn 65. Those with a birthday on the first of a month become eligible the first of the month before they turn 65.

Some become eligible for Medicare before age 65 after receiving Social Security Disability Insurance for 24 months or when diagnosed with certain medical conditions.

TFL is available to military retirees and their family members who qualify for TRICARE, are entitled to Medicare Part A, and have Medicare Part B, regardless of age or place of residence. You can sign up on the Social Security Administration website or by calling SSA to schedule an appointment.

Learn more by reading the TRICARE and Medicare Under Age 65 Brochure.

If you (or your spouse) are still working and have employer-sponsored health coverage when you turn 65, Medicare allows you to delay enrollment in Medicare Part B. But if you do delay enrollment, you won’t have TRICARE coverage. Answer a few questions on the Medicare webpage to find out what’s right for you.

If one family member becomes eligible for Medicare and is now covered by TFL, other family members not yet eligible for Medicare can still use TRICARE Prime or TRICARE Select.

Avoid penalties

It’s important to sign up for Medicare Part A and Part B during your Initial Enrollment Period, which is seven months long. This is when you’re first eligible to sign up for Medicare Part A and Part B. It starts three or four months before you turn 65. Learn more about late enrollment penalties and how to avoid them.

To avoid coverage gaps, keep your information current in the Defense Enrollment Eligibility System. This ensures you receive timely updates and benefits information.

Sign up for Medicare no later than two months before the month you turn 65 to avoid a break in your TRICARE coverage. There are no enrollment forms or fees required for TFL —it begins automatically the first date Medicare Part A and Part B are effective.

To learn more, check out the TRICARE and Medicare Turning Age 65 Brochure.

What parts of Medicare do you need?

To be eligible for TFL, you must have both Medicare Part A and Part B.

Part A typically covers:

Inpatient hospital care

Skilled nursing facilities

Hospice

Some home health care

Most people get Part A premium-free if they, or their spouse, worked and paid Social Security taxes for at least 10 years.

Medicare Part B covers:

Outpatient care

Certain preventive services

Durable medical equipment

Part B has a monthly premium based on your income.

You don’t need to enroll in Medicare Advantage (Part C) or prescription drug coverage (Part D) to have TFL coverage. Read the TRICARE Newsroom article “Q&A: How Does TRICARE For Life Work With Medicare?” to learn more.

For dental and vision coverage, check to see if you qualify through the Federal Employees Dental and Vision Insurance Program.

Coverage overseas

Medicare only provides coverage in the U.S. and U.S. territories. If you live or travel overseas, TRICARE becomes your primary payer. That means you’ll pay TRICARE’s annual deductible and cost for care abroad. You must still have Medicare Part B to remain eligible for TFL, even though it doesn’t pay for care.

Here’s what else to keep in mind if you have TFL and live or travel overseas:

You may visit any TRICARE-authorized provider for care.

If you’re in the Philippines, you must see a Philippine Preferred Provider Network or certified providers.

Be prepared to pay for services up front. You’ll need to file a claim later.

You have up to three years to file claims for overseas care.

Which pays first: Medicare or TRICARE?

When both Medicare and TRICARE cover a health care service, Medicare pays first and TRICARE pays second. TRICARE may also cover services that Medicare doesn’t. That’s why it’s important to confirm you’re covered by Medicare, TRICARE, or both—to help avoid costs.

You’ll also need to use Medicare providers. Check out TRICARE’s covered services to learn more.

Coordination with other health insurance

Other health insurance, or OHI, is coverage in addition to Medicare and TFL. This might be offered by an employer, based on current employment or retirement for you or your spouse.

How Medicare coordinates with OHI depends on whether the OHI is based on current employment. In either case, TRICARE pays last.

Unlock your health—and peace of mind—by understanding how TFL and Medicare work together, as described in the Medicare publication How Medicare Works With Other Insurance. You can view or print the booklet or call 800-MEDICARE (800-633-4227) to find out if a copy can be mailed to you.

FORT CAVAZOS, Texas – *Note: This article was originally published Jan. 24. It was updated Feb. 24 to reflect the payment deadline extension to March 31.*

Beneficiaries who live in the West Region, now have until March 31 to set-up payment with the new West Region contractor, TriWest Healthcare Alliance.

Beneficiaries who pay for TRICARE coverage using a bank electronic funds transfer, credit card, or debit card, must securely give recurring payment information to TriWest prior to the new deadline, and those who don’t act by these dates will be disenrolled, retroactive to Jan. 1.

According to TRICARE, The Defense Health Agency has extended the payment deadline for those enrolled in a TRICARE premium-based plan (TRICARE Young Adult, TRICARE Reserve Select, and TRICARE Retired Reserve). You now have until Tuesday, Mar. 31 to provide your payment information to TriWest.

If you have TRICARE Prime or TRICARE Select, you also have until Tuesday, Mar. 31 to pay your fees.

The latest deadline extension comes as a number of beneficiaries and health care providers have reported difficulty with the TriWest online portal, including long wait times to reach TriWest’s call center.

According to the Defense Health Agency, it’s aware that TRICARE beneficiaries transitioning in the West are experiencing significant call wait times and that TriWest is bringing on additional staff to reduce wait time and ensure TRICARE beneficiaries have the support they need to get their questions answered, transfer payment information to maintain health care coverage.

DHA also says that it knows many beneficiaries have active referrals in the West Region that have not been authorized by TriWest and that all active referrals and pre-authorizations from the previous contractors (Health Net Federal Services or Humana) that were issued before Jan. 1, 2025, will be honored by TriWest and will be valid through their expiration or June 30, 2025, whichever comes first. The TRICARE Health Plan team is working directly with TriWest to actively process all existing referrals. You can check your referral status or get assistance by visiting the TriWest online or calling 888-874-9378.

On a recent trip, there was a suspiciously long line in the bakery section with shoppers eager for something sweet. As I inched closer, I saw slices of a brand new cake getting snatched up as soon as they were plated. The sample was the Costco peaches and cream bar cake, and I was lucky enough to snag a bite.

What is Costco’s peaches and cream bar cake?

Kristina Vanni for Taste of Home

The peaches and cream bar cake is 37 ounces of dessert bliss, with fluffy whipped cream and tart peach filling sandwiched between layers of vanilla sponge cake. I loved the delicate white chocolate curls on top as an extra flourish. For $18.99, this large dessert is a bargain for serving a crowd. The size and shape is consistent with Costco’s other bar cakes, like the springtime carrot bar cake or everyone’s favorite tuxedo mousse cake, which is a staple in the bakery case.

How did the Costco peaches and cream bar cake taste?

After the first bite of the sample, I knew this cake was coming home with me. I certainly hope it becomes an annual flavor offering, because I would line up to buy it again. The texture was delightfully light and airy, as a perfect sponge cake should be. Since it’s made with whipped cream rather than heavier buttercream frosting, this also contributed to it being more delicate. Several Reddit users had the same thought as me: Rather than being too sweet, this cake leaned more tart because of the peaches.

The cake would be perfect to serve at a summer baby or bridal shower. I think it would also be a big hit at a graduation party. The flavor profile makes it a great choice to serve after a heavier meal like a summertime backyard barbecue.

How long will the peaches and cream bar cake be at Costco?

Costco loves to be secretive about the comings and goings of its products, so there’s no real way of knowing how long this cake will remain on store shelves. However, at the rate they were being snatched up, I’d say this cake is selling fast. If you’re interested in getting one for yourself, time is of the essence!

We have offices in Scottsbluff, Kearney, Lincoln, Omaha, and Washington, D.C. We also host Mobile Office Hours across the state. We have already visited all 93 counties this year and we visited them all twice last year. Our team is specially trained in assisting constituents with concerns and complaints. We can also answer questions about services, eligibility, or benefits from federal agencies like the Veterans Affairs, Medicare, or the Internal Revenue Service. I’m proud of our work to cut red tape and deliver wins for Nebraskans.

In 2024, we helped nearly 800 Nebraskans access federal services. We also helped constituents save or recover nearly $5 million from the federal government. We continue that work this year and have already returned $1.3 million in constituent savings for Nebraskans.

Richard out in the Panhandle is one example. He’s a disabled veteran. His disability requires him to get significant help for everyday tasks, like going through his mail. Late last year, the VA notified Richard that he owed nearly $20,000. This was because his dependent status had not been updated since 2015. Richard was shocked by this, as he had never been informed an update was needed. That’s because his VA notices had been inadvertently thrown away without his awareness.

Richard contacted my office in Lincoln after trying for months to submit the needed paperwork. This disabled veteran had no way of repaying this debt that he accidentally incurred. My team got involved and helped establish a claim. The VA updated his dependent status which wiped away Richard’s debt, saving him nearly $20,000.

A couple from Dodge County contacted my office asking for help. They always file their taxes on paper. In 2023, the IRS made a big mistake and said they owed over $34,000. Not only did these Nebraskans not owe money, but they were due a refund of over $25,000. The IRS then refused to pay their 2022 refund because of the mix-up.

This couple tried to fix it themselves. They sent letters asking for help and got no response. They even met with the IRS in Omaha. When they came to my office for help, our casework team got to work immediately. We found the IRS’s mistakes and showed them they were wrong.

Soon after that, the Nebraskans finally got a refund check for over $22,000. That included almost $1,500 in interest—which still wasn’t the right amount. After more hard work, we helped them get another check. In the end, the Dodge County couple received the money they were owed. It took more than a year, but we never gave up.

Other times, oversight means ensuring Nebraska companies are not overlooked on federal directories. A healthcare provider in Eastern Nebraska reached out to my office. They are an in-network provider for TRICARE. TRICARE is the health care program that serves our military members, veterans, and their families. However, TRICARE’s website failed to list this provider as an acceptable option.

That simple omission caused serious confusion. Patients didn’t know they could get care from this provider. As a result, this provider faced an estimated $150,000 in lost revenue.

My team reached out to TriWest, a contractor who manages TRICARE’s network in our region. We pushed them to fix the website and ensure this provider was listed correctly. Thanks to our efforts, the problem was resolved. The VA website was updated.

Now, military families and veterans who are TRICARE beneficiaries can see this proud Nebraska company listed as a trusted, in-network provider. That’s not just a win for this provider. It’s a win for every Nebraskan who depends on clear information and quality care.

These are just three of many examples of how my team and I work every day to help Nebraskans navigate the federal bureaucracy. We’re continuing the fight to protect taxpayer dollars and ensure federal agencies serve the people. From streamlining government to cutting taxes on Social Security, tips, and military retirement benefits, I’ll keep working to make government work better. We’re going to continue delivering excellent customer service for our constituents. Nebraskans deserve nothing less.

Poor mental health can cause teens to withdraw socially, perform worse at school, or engage in risky or destructive behavior.5 In extreme cases, mental ill-health in teens may lead to self-harm or even suicide.6 So, it’s important that teen mental health isn’t taken lightly.

TRICARE’s mental health benefits for adolescents mean that they will cover most mental health services that are deemed medically necessary. However, it is important to connect your teen with the right type of mental health care.

Sometimes, a combination of medication (such as antidepressants) and therapy is needed; combining cognitive behavioral therapy with selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) antidepressants has been shown to boost recovery rates in depressed teens, for example.7

If you feel that you are better suited to online therapy, your regional contractor will have a list of approved providers that offer telemedicine services, such as Mission Prep. Telehealth allows you to access professional mental health support in the comfort of your own home.

When you sign up to TRICARE it’s worth taking time to familiarize yourself with your plan, how much it costs, and the benefits it gives you. For example, if you are required to pay some of the costs yourself – these are called “out-of-pocket” costs.

Out-of-Pocket Costs

Always check that your plan covers any mental health treatment or therapy that your teen needs to avoid any unexpected costs or bills to pay. For example, if you visit a non-network provider you may have to pay higher costs and you may have to handle your own claims.

In some instances, you may have to pay upfront costs and make a claim for reimbursement. It is important to ensure that you can afford to do so and that you are not placing yourself in unmanageable debt as this can cause additional stress and strain on your family. If possible, make some preparations for the interim time whilst you wait to receive your money back.

Maximizing Benefits

To keep your out-of-pocket costs as low as possible, make sure you know the rules about referrals and authorizations before making an appointment. It’s good to also familiarize yourself with their exclusions to understand what types of services are NOT covered to avoid any unexpected charges.

Furthermore, we recommend seeking out advice as to whether you are entitled to any other help or government benefits to use in conjunction with TRICARE that may help you or your family.

Advocating for CU Anschutz in Washington, D.C., 6-27-25

Dear CU Anschutz community,

Over the past several weeks, we have traveled to Washington, D.C., along with leadership from across the University of Colorado system, to meet with members of Colorado's congressional delegation on key issues critical to our campus and our mission. These visits are vital opportunities to advocate for our campus, our people and the work that defines CU Anschutz.

This week, we raised urgent concerns about delayed and disrupted federal research funding, including mission-critical NIH grants. We reinforced the concern over graduate and professional student borrowing limits that would create new barriers for aspiring health professionals, particularly those from rural communities and economically disadvantaged backgrounds. And, as the state’s largest physician provider, we emphasized the importance of federal programs such as Medicaid, Medicare and Tricare in providing coverage for all Coloradans.

We also shared the success stories that position CU Anschutz as a national leader in academic medicine ‒ from groundbreaking cancer care to pioneering research in traumatic brain injury and substance use disorders to our growing presence in Colorado Springs, Fort Collins and rural regions across the state. These stories help our lawmakers understand the real-world impact of policy decisions, and they highlight the extraordinary work being led by all of you.

As we continue these conversations with both state and federal leaders, our message remains clear: CU Anschutz is an essential and trusted partner in delivering the finest healthcare today and in building a healthier future for all. We will keep advocating for the resources, policies and support that empower your work and deepen our impact across Colorado and beyond.

We understand the concerns of our faculty, students and staff during these uncertain times, and we remain committed to advocating fiercely on your behalf and for the mission we all share. It's simply too important to do anything less.

Saraceni, a member of U.S. Navy Medicine Readiness and Training Command Guantanamo Bay, transformed geographic isolation into innovation, crafting a resilient, mission-ready nursing culture at U.S.
Naval Hospital Guantanamo Bay.
Rebeca Rodriguez, the hospital’s chief nursing officer, nominated Saraceni for the award.
Bond Henry, chief nursing officer for Defense Health Network (DHN) Atlantic, coordinated award nominations across the region.","In the second year of the Defense Health Agency’s Annual Nursing Awards, Cmdr. Crystal Saraceni was honored with the 2025 award for Healthy Work Environment, a recognition reserved for those who define excellence in military nursing.

The award included civilians and nurses from the Army, Navy, and Air Force, distinguishing Saraceni from more than 29,000 nurses within the Military Health System.

Saraceni, a member of U.S. Navy Medicine Readiness and Training Command Guantanamo Bay, transformed geographic isolation into innovation, crafting a resilient, mission-ready nursing culture at U.S. Naval Hospital Guantanamo Bay. Cmdr. Rebeca Rodriguez, the hospital’s chief nursing officer, nominated Saraceni for the award.

“We often focus so hard on ensuring deckplate Sailors are recognized for their accomplishments that we forget that leadership is at the deckplate as well,” Rodriguez said. “Seeing the hard work and determination that she puts into everything she does makes me so proud. I wanted everyone to be aware of her passion and incredible work ethic.”

The Healthy Work Environment Award recognizes Saraceni for her impact creating a better workplace environment and inspiring nurses and corpsmen to continuously improve and excel.

“Leadership is about establishing trust and building a solid team,” Saraceni said. “I will forever be grateful for the opportunity to participate in this journey.”

As Clinical Nurse Specialist, Director of Clinical Support Services, and Chief Nursing Informatics Officer, Saraceni tackled challenges related to the hospital’s low-patient volume. Recognizing the risk of skill atrophy, she introduced hands-on training to maintain clinical readiness, covering procedures like anticoagulant injections and nasogastric tube care. Her efforts enhanced clinical competencies and fostered a culture of continuous learning and patient safety.

“I was shocked to get news of being selected for this award; it is humbling to receive this recognition,” Saraceni said. “To me, it’s a matter of doing my job. I come to work, do my best and hope that the lessons we learn together establish a groundwork for success in my teammates’ future careers. In my position, a huge part of my responsibility is to train and support our nursing and corps staff.”

Chief Hospital Corpsman LeMichael Wright, senior enlisted leader for Clinical Support Services, was one of several sailors who provided feedback to support Saraceni’s nomination. Wright praised her leadership and commitment to professional development.

“Commander Saraceni is a dedicated and exceptional leader who balances mission success with the well-being of her team,” Wright said. “She consistently recognizes her staff's achievements and goes above and beyond to ensure the morale and functionality of her departments, even during critical manpower shortages. Her leadership was crucial during Operation Southern Guard, where she selflessly shifted roles to support the mission, prioritizing the needs of others over her own. Her commitment to her personnel and the mission exemplifies a leadership style that is truly unparalleled.”

Under her leadership, departments earned three of the last four Department of the Quarter awards. She also supported staff morale through activities like the Captain’s Cup, promoting camaraderie and self-care.

“She’s a strong advocate for all personnel on the island,” said Capt. Tammy Servies, hospital director and commanding officer of USNMRTC Guantanamo Bay. “Our unique location and patient population require constant advocacy, and I can always count on her to fight for our patients.

“This recognition is a long time coming,” Servies continued. “She is truly an expert in many fields and her push to cross-train our nurses in this remote location demonstrates her forward-leaning strategic thinking.”

Capt. Bond Henry, chief nursing officer for Defense Health Network (DHN) Atlantic, coordinated award nominations across the region.

“We selected one nomination from each category to move forward from our Network, fine-tuned the nominations, and submitted to be considered across the entire DHA,” said Henry. “Commander Saraceni was highlighted as a leader who has thrived in a small and isolated environment, which requires top performers to fill multiple roles at once. Her leadership style and proactive approach to problem solving created a healthy work environment for all the staff in Guantanamo Bay.”

The Defense Health Agency (DHA) manages military treatment facilities across the Department of Defense, integrating healthcare services to enhance readiness, improve patient outcomes, and streamline medical operations. As part of this system, USNH Guantanamo Bay plays a vital role as the only hospital delivering healthcare to service members and their families, federal employees, U.S. and foreign national contractors, stationed at Naval Station Guantanamo Bay. The hospital also operates the Department of Defense’s only overseas military home healthcare program, providing ongoing care to elderly special category residents who sought asylum on the installation during the Cuban Revolution.",https://d1ldvf68ux039x.cloudfront.net/thumbs/photos/2506/9136559/1000w_q95.jpg,N,1.0,2025-06-27 16:56:33.830162

If a non-career veteran is eligible for VA healthcare, couldn’t that be used in place of Medicare?
FYI, I have previously explained numerous times that veterans who rely on the VA for 100% of their healthcare can, indeed, disenroll from Medicare Part B (thus saving the monthly Part B premium).
That said, I fully understand that some veterans rely exclusively on the VA for their healthcare needs, and I have explained to many who have written to me that they have that option.
So, please rest assured that we regularly advise our veterans about their healthcare options under Medicare, including the ability to decline Medicare Part B coverage if they have full VA healthcare coverage.","DEAR RUSTY: In your answer to a retired U.S. Navy veteran about why he is forced to enroll in Medicare, you focused on military TriCare’s requirement for the member to enroll in Medicare. But you said nothing about regular VA healthcare. If a non-career veteran is eligible for VA healthcare, couldn’t that be used in place of Medicare? — Veteran Advocate

DEAR VETERAN ADVOCATE: Thank you for your feedback. FYI, I have previously explained numerous times that veterans who rely on the VA for 100% of their healthcare can, indeed, disenroll from Medicare Part B (thus saving the monthly Part B premium). I don’t personally recommend it because of my personal experience, but it certainly is possible to do so.

Personally, I use the VA for some of my healthcare needs — usually an annual checkup and optometry services — at my local VA clinic, which is only a mile away from where I live. But for any extensive treatment needs (medical tests, etc.) I must travel about 40 miles to the nearest VA hospital facility.

For contrast, I have numerous private healthcare services, specialists and hospitals very near where I live, but to use them under the VA I must get VA pre-approval and use only certain VA-approved providers, which is inconvenient for me.

Personally, I prefer the freedom to go to any healthcare service provider I choose, without restriction, at any time I need to. So, I use my VA coverage when it is convenient for me but rely also on non-VA, Medicare-approved specialists who I can choose to use (or not) at will. For me, it’s a matter of convenience and the freedom to use whichever healthcare provider I want.

That said, I fully understand that some veterans rely exclusively on the VA for their healthcare needs, and I have explained to many who have written to me that they have that option. I have also published several public articles about this as well.

So, please rest assured that we regularly advise our veterans about their healthcare options under Medicare, including the ability to decline Medicare Part B coverage if they have full VA healthcare coverage. FYI, free Medicare Part A (inpatient hospitalization coverage) is mandatory to collect Social Security after age 65, but Medicare Part B coverage is always optional because there is a premium associated with Part B. A veteran can decline Medicare Part B coverage and save that monthly premium, but they would need to contact Social Security to do so.

Social Security will want to interview the veteran to ensure they are aware of the potential financial consequences of not having Medicare Part B. And they may need to file form CMS-1763 (Request for Termination). But a non-career veteran can opt out of Medicare Part B if they get all of their healthcare services through the VA.

I know Tricare doesn’t play nicely with everyone.
I’d call around to both their billing department and Tricare (tricare first).

You may have seen an out of network urgent care and are subject to point of service fees.","If it's the first time you're using the coverage and you're on Select, you have a deductible to meet along with the cost-share.

Your explanation of benefits will explain how the claim was processed and how much you owe.

Select is probably the best coverage we get from Tricare. Once you understand to track your deductible and you learn who is in network(even using out of network, it wasn’t even expensive), it actually is the best coverage. I actually prefer it even when I used universal health insurance in Germany and Australia. Tricare select (when you learn how to use it) is hard to beat.

People just get scared about the idea of paying out of pocket that they rather just go with prime for mediocre care.

Some places like to balance bill, even though they’re not supposed to, and hope that the insured doesn’t know to question it. Could be another billing issue altogether. Maybe it’s Sentara. I know Tricare doesn’t play nicely with everyone. I went to get my kid a physical at a MultiCare urgent care (I’m in a healthcare desert; urgent care is basically our primary doc), and they said that Tricare wouldn’t contract with them to pay for sports physicals (but Tricare will pay for everything else), so it was $350 up front. They were also kind enough to recommend other urgent cares that did play nice with Tricare.

So if that’s the case here, for some reason, they should have told you up front. I’d call around to both their billing department and Tricare (tricare first). They should cover a lot more than $44.67 even if you haven’t reached your deductible.

Always call the nurse advice line before seeking urgent care. They will direct you to the correct echelon of care and to ask network provider.

""Provider organizations can no longer afford to let complex claims stall in their aging buckets,"" said Doug Brown, Founder of Black Book Research. ""Specialized AR segments demand precise recovery models, policy fluency, and advanced denial intelligence - whether the issue is payer resistance, clinical ambiguity, or legal complexity.""

Ten High-Impact Complex AR Categories in 2025

Workers' Compensation & Third-Party Liability These claims demand extensive legal coordination, state-specific rules adherence, and long-cycle tracking due to employer and insurer documentation requirements. Top Rated Vendor: EnableComp

Veterans Affairs (VA) & TRICARE Providers continue to report operational frustration with federal healthcare programs, including delayed authorizations, inconsistent reimbursement standards, and time-intensive appeals. Top Rated Vendor: EnableComp

Motor Vehicle Accident (MVA) and Personal Injury These claims frequently intersect with ongoing litigation, unclear payer responsibility, and documentation demands that require payer and legal team coordination. Top Rated Vendor: EnableComp

Clinical Denials & Medical Necessity Appeals Claims denied for inpatient status, medical necessity, or DRG assignment have the highest financial exposure. These require clinically credentialed teams and deep payer-specific appeal tactics. Top Rated Vendor: Knowtion Health

Legacy AR and Runoff Accounts Aging AR tied to facility acquisitions, EHR transitions, or defunct cost centers often stagnate unless recovered by firms with reconciliation and platform-agnostic retrieval skills. Top Rated Vendor: XTend Healthcare

High-Balance Self-Pay and Underinsured The rise of high-deductible health plans has pushed significant payment responsibility onto patients. Recovery depends on empathetic, data-driven financial engagement tools. Top Rated Vendor: Cedar

Medicaid and Indigent Care Retroactive eligibility, manual processing, and fragmented state regulations continue to challenge providers attempting to collect from public and indigent payer programs. Top Rated Vendor: XTend Healthcare

International and Cross-Border Claims Payers outside the U.S., including embassies and foreign insurers, add complexity through documentation differences, language barriers, and verification delays. Top Rated Vendor: Nymbl Systems

Out-of-Network and No Authorization Claims These denied claims often require extensive appeal documentation and are prone to long legal or negotiation cycles before partial payments are issued. Top Rated Vendor: Intersect Healthcare

Social Determinants and Care Setting Ambiguity New denial types are emerging around SDoH factors such as housing instability and unclear categorization of care environments (e.g., emergency vs. urgent care). Top Rated Vendor: Socially Determined

Black Book's 18 Universal KPIs for Complex AR Evaluation

Black Book's qualitative KPIs for evaluating complex AR vendors include specialized claim expertise, regulatory knowledge, recovery effectiveness, client responsiveness, and transparent reporting. Key factors also involve accurate payer identification, workflow flexibility, staff credentials, and quality appeal documentation. Additionally, proactive denial management, consistent recoveries, empathetic patient engagement, timely recovery actions, client-specific adaptability, ethical standards, negotiation effectiveness, and strong client retention rates are critical components.

""These indicators provide the foundation for selecting and retaining the right vendors to manage the revenue that too often gets written off,"" Brown added.

47 years old / 52 years old - from Portland

We have been a couple for 3 years and live in Portland.

Our sex life came to a standstill a little more than a year ago and we were aware that our relationship wouldn`'t last long if it continued like this. So we looked for solutions.

My penis was 10cm″ long and I ejaculated within a 3 minutes. I consulted a sexologist, went to the gym, took off the counter pills... even tried a pump I saw somewhere.. Nothinig helped.

Finally, a friend recommended I tried these pills he have been taken for a while. I researched the web and found amaing testimonials showing with impressive before and after photos. Men said they saved their relationship using TribalForce X. I always had a hard time believing in this kind of publicity, but this time we decided to try it, I didn't have much to lose.

It arrived 2 days later in a discreet package that my girlfriend didn't notice.

I followed the simple instructions, 2 pill in the morning every day and after 2 weeks I was surprised of my colossal new size and energy...

My Girlfriend also took noticed when I fucked her.. it turns out she wasn’t tired of sex... she just wanted a huge hard rock cock to worship and get off with.

Now, she can’t get enough of it.

She wakes me up with a blowjob almost every day, and begs me to fuck her!

So my results since I started taking TribalForce X, my penis is 6.6cm″ longer and also much thicker. Now I can last 1 hour straight without coming and I can finally satisfy my girlfriend. It's been only a month and a half since I started the cure but I still have the same size and stamina...

Be careful of fake copies of TribalForce X. Those can be dangerous.

That 50% you're thinking of isn't with Select, that's Prime POS benefits.

If you’re not on a base, get select. I was on prime and ran into some vision-threatening issues and getting referrals and authorizations from a a civilian PCM when you need urgent speciality care is added stress you don’t need. I needed a referral from my PCM to go to the optometrist and get my initial referral to ophthalmology. I’d rather jsut pay the $32 to go see ophthalmology on my own vs going through hoops to get a $0 visit

I don’t pay anywhere near 50%. I don’t pay anywhere near 20%. I’ve been on Select for 20 years. It’s the absolute best. There’s so much freedom with it. I think the most I pay as a copay is for my medication, which is brand name and costs thousands of dollars retail, and I pay around $119. But pre-2021, I paid like $15. So thanks for that, capitalism.

Imo, it’s so worth it. You don’t need referrals for insurance, and any referrals you do get because of office preference don’t expire. You can go to any doctor. Even if they’re not in network and bill Tricare, they’ll still get paid. I honestly think it’s the best in the country.

The only downside is that you can’t use it on a military installation outside of the pharmacy and emergency room. So if you want to see, say, a cardiologist, you can’t use one on the installation. You have to use civilian. That part sucks if you’re in a pinch or in a healthcare desert like I am, but in the long run it’s still better. And in your area, I’m sure most docs will take it.

With rising awareness of mental health care and its importance, insurance coverage is a critical concern for many families and individuals.

In this blog, North Penn Now will review how insurance works in the Idaho rehab context, explore coverage specifics—including Tricare—and clarify your options so you feel empowered to make an informed decision.

Understanding Insurance and Rehab Coverage in Idaho

Insurance policies vary widely, from private commercial plans to government-sponsored programs and military benefits like Tricare. Understanding how these systems intersect with rehab services is key.

Rehab centers in Idaho may offer inpatient residential programs, outpatient services, medication-assisted treatment, dual-diagnosis care, and more. Some even offer treatment plans customized to address specific challenges. Each type of treatment may or may not be covered differently under insurance plans.

In-Network vs. Out-of-Network Providers

First, it's essential to check whether a treatment center is considered in‑network or out‑of‑network. In‑network means the rehab center has a contract with your insurance company, offering negotiated rates that usually minimize your out‑of‑pocket costs.

Out‑of‑network providers don’t have such agreements, meaning coverage may still be available but typically involves higher deductibles, co‑pays, or coinsurance. Many Idaho rehabs—especially the most reputable ones—work with major insurance carriers to be in-network, though availability can differ by region and by facility.

Private Insurance Plans

If you or someone in your family has a private health plan—through an employer or purchased individually—be sure to contact the insurer directly. Ask whether substance use treatment is a covered benefit, and if so, what specific levels of care are included (such as detox, residential, outpatient, or aftercare).

While federal parity laws require most health plans to provide equal financial coverage for mental health and substance use treatment as physical health, certain limits (like length of stay) may still apply.

Some rehab centers in Idaho have dedicated staff to help verify benefits and coordinate pre-authorizations for you.

Medicaid Coverage in Idaho

Idaho’s Medicaid program does cover substance use treatment, though the scope can vary depending on eligibility category. Some individuals qualify through traditional Medicaid, while others may access coverage through expansion categories such as those first-time enrollees under the Affordable Care Act.

Many Idaho rehabs are part of the Medicaid network and able to provide services like outpatient counseling, partial hospitalization programs (PHP), and residential treatment. It’s important to confirm if a facility meets Medicaid requirements, including licensure and acceptance of managed care plans.

Medicare and Older Adults

For people over 65 or those with qualifying disabilities, Medicare may help cover rehab services. However, Medicare’s coverage of inpatient rehab is more limited. While it covers hospital-level psychiatric care, skilled nursing stays, and Medicare-certified outpatient programs, standalone substance use disorder treatment programs may not always qualify.

Therefore, facilities that participate in Medicare may offer some covered services but not others. Idaho residents with Medicare are encouraged to work with rehab intake staff or a case manager to understand what’s included.

Spotlight on Tricare Coverage

Tricare serves active-duty military, National Guard, Reservists, and their families, as well as some veterans under the age of 65. When asking whether top rehabs in Idaho accept insurance, it’s vital to consider military benefits as well.

Tricare covers mental health and substance use treatment, including inpatient rehab, outpatient therapy, and residential care in community-based facilities that meet specific criteria.

How Tricare Works with Rehab Centers

Rehab centers seeking Tricare reimbursement must obtain proper credentials and become authorized providers. Many accredited treatment centers in Idaho—especially those known for excellence—do seek Tricare approval to accommodate military families.

Coverage levels might vary between Tricare Prime, Select, or overseas plans. In general, Tricare Prime requires referral and pre-approval, while Tricare Select allows more flexibility with out-of-network providers, albeit with higher cost-sharing.

Always check with both the rehab center and your regional Tricare contractor to confirm prior authorization requirements and cost estimates.

Copay, Deductible, and Cost-sharing

For Tricare Prime users, inpatient rehab often has minimal or no copays if referred through a military treatment facility (MTF). Support services and therapy sessions under outpatient care are subject to fixed copays depending on the plan type.

Under Tricare Select, coverage levels are similar to civilian PPO plans: plans may cover 70‑80% of cost for authorized treatment, with beneficiaries responsible for deductibles and cost-shares. That means finding a Tricare‑authorized facility within Idaho is crucial to minimizing out‑of‑pocket expenses.

Idaho’s Top Rehabs and Insurance Compatibility

Rehab facilities in Idaho range from large, accredited centers offering comprehensive programming to smaller, boutique-style treatment homes. Let’s look at how most of the leading facilities navigate insurance and Tricare coverage.

Academic and Hospital-Affiliated Programs

Facilities associated with universities or hospitals often have robust insurance infrastructure. These programs usually accept a broad mix of commercial plans, Medicaid, Tricare, and sometimes Medicare.

Their billing departments can pre‑verify insurance benefits and guide families through claims. They also tend to be early adopters of behavioral-health parity compliance and stay current on Tricare credentialing processes.

Private Residential and Holistic Centers

Many privately owned residential centers in Idaho work actively to become in‑network providers for major insurance carriers, including Tricare. These Tricare centers offer detox along with group and individual therapy, family counseling, and dual‑diagnosis care.

Some have dedicated liaisons who verify whether clients are covered under commercial insurance, Medicaid expansion, or Tricare and help arrange preauthorization. That said, coverage depends on facility accreditation, staff credentials, and the specific treatment services offered.

Outpatient and Intensive Outpatient Programs

For those not needing residential care, Idaho offers a wide array of outpatient treatment programs. These may include outpatient counseling and intensive outpatient treatment (IOP).

Outpatient care tends to be more consistently covered by insurance plans, including commercial, Medicaid, Medicare, and Tricare, because the costs are lower and the care is time-limited. These programs are often ideal for working adults or those with family obligations.

Telehealth and Virtual Care

Telehealth has grown tremendously, and insurance plans—including Tricare—cover these services, especially since the COVID-19 pandemic. Many Idaho providers now include virtual counseling sessions and group therapy components.

Coverage for virtual rehab services can be as extensive as for in-person formats, though it varies by insurer and plan type. Telehealth can offer significant convenience, particularly for rural areas without easy access to in-person centers.

Steps to Confirm Insurance Coverage for Rehab

Whether you're exploring options for yourself or someone you care about, there are action steps you can take to clarify coverage:

Check Your Insurance Plan Documents

Begin with your member handbook, policy summary, or online portal. Look under categories like 'Substance Use Disorder (SUD)', ‘Behavioral Health’, or ‘Mental Health and Addictions Treatment’. Confirm what services are covered, what the cost-sharing structure looks like, and whether reference to specific facility networks is provided.

Contact Insurance Provider Customer Service

Directly call the phone number on your insurance card. Use this to:

Confirm whether rehab benefits apply

Learn about inpatient versus outpatient coverage

Ask about length-of-stay limits or service caps

Request a list of in‑network treatment centers, including Tricare-authorized

Make note of the representative’s name and any reference numbers if they issue you a confirmation or eligibility number.

Reach Out to Rehab Centers Early

Quality treatment centers in Idaho often help by reviewing your insurance benefits with you. They’ll ask for your subscriber information, plan number, and group policy ID, then talk to your insurer to confirm authorization.

They can estimate your financial responsibility and outline any documentation needed for claims. If they don’t handle this for you, ask if they can refer you to a third‑party verification company.

Plan for Out-of-Network or Self-Pay Options

If your preferred rehab center isn’t in-network, you may still access services. Some have sliding-scale rates or payment plans. Rehabilitation stays can also be reimbursed post-treatment, depending on your policy.

Always ask for an itemized bill and take advantage of any out-of-network reimbursement benefits.

Get Started on a Stable Path to Recovery in Idaho

So, do the top rehabs in Idaho accept insurance to cover treatment costs? The answer is yes—most reputable and accredited treatment programs in the state do work directly with major insurances, Medicaid, Medicare, and military plans like Tricare.

But coverage levels, authorizations, and your out-of-pocket responsibility depend on your plan type, the facility’s provider status, and the level of treatment you need.

If you or your loved one is exploring rehab options in Idaho, take these steps: verify your plan benefits early, confirm the rehab’s in-network status (especially with Tricare if applicable), ask about pre-authorizations and length-of-stay limitations, and map out your full continuum of care, including aftercare and therapy. With clarity and advocacy, you can reduce financial stress and focus on what matters most—recovery and healing.

Idaho offers excellent treatment resources, and many centers go above and beyond to simplify the insurance process. Taking proactive steps early ensures the only thing you worry about is getting healthy.",,N,0.0,2025-06-26 18:56:34.181254

WHAT YOU NEED TO KNOW: The TRICARE referral and authorization waiver for the West Region will expire on June 30. After that date, providers must follow standard TRICARE requirements for all new outpatient services.

The U.S. Defense Health Agency has confirmed that the temporary waiver of referral and authorization requirements for TRICARE Prime beneficiaries in the West Region will end on June 30, 2025. Beginning July 1, 2025, all outpatient services for TRICARE Prime patients will once again require appropriate referrals and authorizations in accordance with standard TRICARE guidelines.

The waiver was initially enacted to ease administrative burdens during the transition of managed care responsibilities to TriWest Healthcare Alliance (TriWest), which assumed management of TRICARE West Region services on January 1, 2025. Under the waiver, providers did not need to submit referral or authorization requests for TRICARE Prime patients seeking TRICARE-covered outpatient services, with some exceptions.

Referrals for care that extends beyond June 30, 2025, will need to follow the prior established TRICARE referral and authorization requirements and obtain approval to continue care after June 30. Referrals issued after June 30, 2025, will be subject to normal TRICARE referral and authorization requirements.

Providers are strongly encouraged to review the TriWest TRICARE Provider Handbook and referral protocols to avoid disruptions in care or reimbursement issues starting July 1.

Veterans Affairs (VA) & TRICARE Providers continue to report operational frustration with federal healthcare programs, including delayed authorizations, inconsistent reimbursement standards, and time-intensive appeals. Top Rated Vendor: EnableComp

Motor Vehicle Accident (MVA) and Personal Injury These claims frequently intersect with ongoing litigation, unclear payer responsibility, and documentation demands that require payer and legal team coordination. Top Rated Vendor: EnableComp

Clinical Denials & Medical Necessity Appeals Claims denied for inpatient status, medical necessity, or DRG assignment have the highest financial exposure. These require clinically credentialed teams and deep payer-specific appeal tactics. Top Rated Vendor: Knowtion Health

Legacy AR and Runoff Accounts Aging AR tied to facility acquisitions, EHR transitions, or defunct cost centers often stagnate unless recovered by firms with reconciliation and platform-agnostic retrieval skills. Top Rated Vendor: XTend Healthcare

High-Balance Self-Pay and Underinsured The rise of high-deductible health plans has pushed significant payment responsibility onto patients. Recovery depends on empathetic, data-driven financial engagement tools. Top Rated Vendor: Cedar

Medicaid and Indigent Care Retroactive eligibility, manual processing, and fragmented state regulations continue to challenge providers attempting to collect from public and indigent payer programs. Top Rated Vendor: XTend Healthcare

International and Cross-Border Claims Payers outside the U.S., including embassies and foreign insurers, add complexity through documentation differences, language barriers, and verification delays. Top Rated Vendor: Nymbl Systems

Out-of-Network and No Authorization Claims These denied claims often require extensive appeal documentation and are prone to long legal or negotiation cycles before partial payments are issued. Top Rated Vendor: Intersect Healthcare

Social Determinants and Care Setting Ambiguity New denial types are emerging around SDoH factors such as housing instability and unclear categorization of care environments (e.g., emergency vs. urgent care). Top Rated Vendor: Socially Determined

Black Book's 18 Universal KPIs for Complex AR Evaluation

Black Book's qualitative KPIs for evaluating complex AR vendors include specialized claim expertise, regulatory knowledge, recovery effectiveness, client responsiveness, and transparent reporting. Key factors also involve accurate payer identification, workflow flexibility, staff credentials, and quality appeal documentation. Additionally, proactive denial management, consistent recoveries, empathetic patient engagement, timely recovery actions, client-specific adaptability, ethical standards, negotiation effectiveness, and strong client retention rates are critical components.

""These indicators provide the foundation for selecting and retaining the right vendors to manage the revenue that too often gets written off,"" Brown added.

“Together, the DOD and VA aim for adaptable, transparent, consistent, high-quality health care that encourages shared decision-making with patients and clinicians.","Department of Defense and Department of Veterans Affairs clinical practice guidelines aim to provide the most recent and accurate evidence-based information to DOD and VA providers.

• For providers, CPGs give them the information needed to diagnose and treat particular medical conditions that may show up in the patient populations they serve.

• For patients, CPGs give them current, understandable information needed to make decisions about their health care.

Researchers have published 28 Clinical Practice Guidelines to date. VA and DOD experts create, maintain, and periodically update these CPGs as new evidence-based research emerges and further advancements in medicine evolve, covering diverse topics.

“The hardest part is keeping up with the advancement in medicine and educating the field and maintaining a standardized approach in the continuum of care for military and veteran communities across both health systems,” said Jenifer Meno, who holds a doctorate of nursing practices, and is the Defense Health Agency deputy chief, Clinical Quality Improvement Program, Medical Affairs/Clinical Support Division.

The multifaceted guidelines “are used globally and liked for their rigor in the systematic review of the literature,” said Meno. She emphasized how the care workflow of each CPG is easy to follow for clinicians and provides clinical support tools that assist with applying the recommendations that support both clinician and patients in shared decision-making.

The CPGs also offer clinical support tools that care teams can use for patient education and provider support. These tools include pocket guides, links to videos, and publications, said Meno.

In the 1990’s, the VA solely published documents similar to today’s CPGs. The Military Health System began planning and implementing broad-scale healthcare reform initiatives in response to the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2017 and additional guidance that followed in the NDAAs for fiscal years 2018–2020.

The current VA-DOD CPG partnership issued its first jointly developed guideline, Management of Posttraumatic Stress Disorder, in 2004. The partnership published three updates on this topic, with the latest in 2023.

So far in 2025, the partnership has published CPGs including:

• Rehabilitation of Lower Limb Amputation on Jan. 13, 2025

• Management of Chronic insomnia Disorder and Obstructive Sleep Apnea on Feb. 26, 2025

• Primary Care Management of Asthma on March 26, 2025

• Primary Care Management of Chronic Kidney Disease on May 16, 2025.

What’s Next

Several new or updated CPGs are currently being developed, including:

• Diagnosis and Management of Hypertension, projected release August 2026

• Management of Adult Obesity and Overweight, projected release August 2025

• Management of Dyslipidemia, projected release September 2025

• Tobacco Cessation, projected release March 2026

• Nonsurgical Management of Hip and Knee Osteoarthritis, projected release May 2026

• Pressure Injury Prevention (bed sores), projected release June 2026

• Menopause Management, projected release August 2026

The CPGs dealing with obesity and overweight will align with Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth’s March 12, 2025, directive requiring service members to remain physically fit to keep U.S. forces in peak condition and readiness.

Key Aspects of VA-DOD CPGs

Each CPG promotes evidence-based practice, optimizes patient outcomes, and reduces inappropriate variations in care. Each CPG includes:

• Systematic reviews of clinical and disease prevention and protection evidence

• Multidisciplinary and expert medical and scientific input

• Critical decision points and the rationale behind them

• Regular updates based on new evidence and best practices

Writing a Value-based CPG

Together, the DOD and VA create and monitor the CPGs for value and effectiveness. A new or updated CPG can take 18 to 24 months to develop and get published, Meno said.

The VA-DOD Health Executive Committee chartered the VA-DOD Evidence-Based Practice Working Group in 2003. The group is comprised of volunteer DOD and VA multi-disciplinary clinicians providing a holistic view of care. Four to five new CPGs are considered by the group each year and the schedule for fiscal year development and updates is set by the group, Meno said.

According to a Jan. 24, 2024, information paper on CPG development by the DHA’s Clinical Quality Improvement Program, existing CPGs are looked at first by the group, especially those where meaningful advancements have been made in science, and then older CPGs are looked at for a possible refresh.

Next, the VA and DOD put together a VA-DOD CPG working group. The VA and the DOD each recruit two champions and eight clinicians from many healthcare disciplines, who they strictly vet for their expertise and lack of any conflicts of interest.

Key Questions and Recommendations Development

The CPG working group schedules a kickoff meeting, followed later in the process by a recommendation development meeting. The DOD and VA also sponsor patient focus groups to understand what matters most to patients and their caregivers.

At kickoff, the subject matter experts define the target patient population and medical audiences for the guideline. They create a large set of key questions to guide literature searches and evidence reviews.

According to Meno, the recommendation development team conducts a multi-day event that seeks to answer whether the recommendations based on the key questions are actionable—Do they work? And, how strong is the scientific evidence?

For a new CPG, the group develops key questions from the ground up. For updates to existing guidelines, the group determines if the CPG aligns with current best practices. The group may also create a new set of key questions.

The team writes three drafts. The reviewers send the third draft for outside peer review, after which the VA-DOD Evidence-Based Working Group receives the final guideline for decision. Once the members approve a CPG, the team creates provider and patient clinical support tools, such as pocket and patient guides. The team publishes approved CPGs and clinical support tools on DHA and VA websites.

“Together, the DOD and VA aim for adaptable, transparent, consistent, high-quality health care that encourages shared decision-making with patients and clinicians. This improves clinical outcomes and patient satisfaction while reducing the potential for harm and optimizing the use of resources,” Meno said.",https://d1ldvf68ux039x.cloudfront.net/thumbs/photos/2406/8480045/1000w_q95.jpg,N,0.0,2025-06-26 15:56:27.227798

Master Sgt. Aaron Bell, 97th Logistics Readiness Squadron vehicle fleet manager, and Staff Sgt. Jack Brown, 97th Healthcare Operations Squadron TRICARE operations and patient administration non-commissioned officer in charge, were chosen among thousands of Airmen across the Air Force to represent their base and career fields at this elite level.

“Having two people from the same base compete at this level, I’ve never heard of it before,” said Brown. “I’ve spoken to several leaders across the base, and they’ve never seen this since they’ve been in.”

The Air Force OAY Program recognizes nine enlisted members based on their prior year’s performance, based on exceptional job performance in their primary duty, superior leadership, followership, and the epitome of the whole airman concept.

Both Airmen were nominated after winning at the wing and numbered air force level, attributing their success to being a part of effective teams that lifted both of them up to this opportunity. This sentiment was captured by Bell, crediting the source of his victory.

“I feel like I’m representing everyone,” said Bell. “I have a lot of supervisors in the past and present, teammates, mentors, troops, that poured into me and contributed to this.”

Bell also highlighted the responsibility to represent his unit as an, ""obligation to put the best foot forward.” Stressing the importance of investing in personal development, advising younger Airmen to lay strong foundations early in their careers.

“Having your degree gives you more opportunities to serve in special roles,” said Bell. “Getting my Community College of the Air Force degree early allowed me to get selected for a professional military education to become an Airman Leadership School instructor.”

The competition for the award will begin on June 29, 2025, with a professional development course, followed by an assessment board, and concluding with the final selection process.

Unlock your health by signing up for Medicare as soon as you’re eligible. Medicare Part A and Part B are required to remain eligible for TRICARE, with limited exceptions. Knowing how and when to sign up for Medicare will help you avoid gaps in coverage and late enrollment penalties.

“Signing up for Medicare three or four months before your 65th birthday is important to ensure a seamless transition to TRICARE For Life,” said Anne Breslin, TFL program manager, TRICARE Health Plan, at the Defense Health Agency. “Medicare and TRICARE will then work together to help minimize your out-of-pocket expenses.”

Understanding eligibility

Most people become eligible for Medicare the first day of the month they turn 65. Those with a birthday on the first of a month become eligible the first of the month before they turn 65.

Some become eligible for Medicare before age 65 after receiving Social Security Disability Insurance for 24 months or when diagnosed with certain medical conditions.

TFL is available to military retirees and their family members who qualify for TRICARE, are entitled to Medicare Part A, and have Medicare Part B, regardless of age or place of residence. You can sign up on the Social Security Administration website or by calling SSA to schedule an appointment.

Learn more by reading the TRICARE and Medicare Under Age 65 Brochure.

If you (or your spouse) are still working and have employer-sponsored health coverage when you turn 65, Medicare allows you to delay enrollment in Medicare Part B. But if you do delay enrollment, you won’t have TRICARE coverage. Answer a few questions on the Medicare webpage to find out what’s right for you.

If one family member becomes eligible for Medicare and is now covered by TFL, other family members not yet eligible for Medicare can still use TRICARE Prime or TRICARE Select.

Avoid penalties

It’s important to sign up for Medicare Part A and Part B during your Initial Enrollment Period, which is seven months long. This is when you’re first eligible to sign up for Medicare Part A and Part B. It starts three or four months before you turn 65. Learn more about late enrollment penalties and how to avoid them.

To avoid coverage gaps, keep your information current in the Defense Enrollment Eligibility System. This ensures you receive timely updates and benefits information.

Sign up for Medicare no later than two months before the month you turn 65 to avoid a break in your TRICARE coverage. There are no enrollment forms or fees required for TFL —it begins automatically the first date Medicare Part A and Part B are effective.

To learn more, check out the TRICARE and Medicare Turning Age 65 Brochure.

What parts of Medicare do you need?

To be eligible for TFL, you must have both Medicare Part A and Part B.

Part A typically covers:

Inpatient hospital care

Skilled nursing facilities

Hospice

Some home health care

Most people get Part A premium-free if they, or their spouse, worked and paid Social Security taxes for at least 10 years.

Medicare Part B covers:

Outpatient care

Certain preventive services

Durable medical equipment

Part B has a monthly premium based on your income.

You don’t need to enroll in Medicare Advantage (Part C) or prescription drug coverage (Part D) to have TFL coverage. Read the TRICARE Newsroom article “Q&A: How Does TRICARE For Life Work With Medicare?” to learn more.

For dental and vision coverage, check to see if you qualify through the Federal Employees Dental and Vision Insurance Program.

Coverage overseas

Medicare only provides coverage in the U.S. and U.S. territories. If you live or travel overseas, TRICARE becomes your primary payer. That means you’ll pay TRICARE’s annual deductible and cost for care abroad. You must still have Medicare Part B to remain eligible for TFL, even though it doesn’t pay for care.

Here’s what else to keep in mind if you have TFL and live or travel overseas:

You may visit any TRICARE-authorized provider for care.

If you’re in the Philippines, you must see a Philippine Preferred Provider Network or certified providers.

Be prepared to pay for services up front. You’ll need to file a claim later.

You have up to three years to file claims for overseas care.

Which pays first: Medicare or TRICARE?

When both Medicare and TRICARE cover a health care service, Medicare pays first, and TRICARE pays second. TRICARE may also cover services that Medicare doesn’t. That’s why it’s important to confirm you’re covered by Medicare, TRICARE, or both — to help avoid costs.

You’ll also need to use Medicare providers. Check out TRICARE’s covered services to learn more.

Coordination with other health insurance

Other health insurance, or OHI, is coverage in addition to Medicare and TFL. This might be offered by an employer, based on current employment or retirement for you or your spouse.

How Medicare coordinates with OHI depends on whether the OHI is based on current employment. In either case, TRICARE pays last.

Gray replaces Army Col. Lee Freeman, who says William Beaumont Army Medical Center has facility problems.

Col. Gray is 35-year Army veteran with extensive leadership experience.

Army Col. Wendy Gray has become the third woman and 45th Army officer to command the William Beaumont Army Medical Center at Fort Bliss.

Gray, 54, a nurse, has held numerous leadership jobs in her 35-year Army career, including commander of two Army health centers, or medical clinics.

She took control of Beaumont, a more than 100-year-old institution, during a change-of-command ceremony Wednesday, June 25, inside the mammoth medical complex in East El Paso.

""Two words describe how I feel joining the William Beaumont team: Humbled and honored,” Gray said to Army and community dignitaries assembled in the medical complex's cafeteria. The ceremony was livestreamed on Facebook.

New Beaumont commander moves from San Antonio

Gray is moving from San Antonio, where for a year, she was chief of staff for the Army Medical Readiness Command West. It oversees eight Army hospitals, including Beaumont, and three Army health centers in several states.

She takes over for Army Col. Lee Freeman. He’s moving to the Defense Health Agency headquarters in the Washington, D.C., area, where he will be deputy chief of the Army Medical Services Corps.

The Army usually changes the Beaumont commander every two years.

Outgoing commander notes Beaumont facility problems

At the command-change ceremony, Freeman rattled off a list of Beaumont accomplishments during his two-year tenure, including trauma center reaccreditation, increasing hospital capacity for mental health patients, continued progress in operating rooms' utilization, opening of the stand-alone Intrepid Spirit Center to treat traumatic brain injuries, and the continued transition into the almost four-year-old Beaumont campus, with facility problems.

“This is a state-of-the-art, world-class, military medical center,” Freeman said. But, it’s also a “work in progress, when it comes to the facility, and some of the (facility) challenges that it’s facing,” he said.

During Feeman’s tenure, the hospital had two major water pipe breaks that caused flooding and damage in October 2024 and March 2025.

Prior to his command, Beaumont’s water system was shut down for about a month in 2022 because of a water-valve failure, causing the system to be contaminated with sediment.

The six-building medical complex, anchored by the 135-bed Beaumont hospital, also includes clinics and other facilities.

Construction of the $1.5 billion complex was plagued by years of delays and cost overruns. The new hospital opened July 11, 2021.

Beaumont complex has 4,000-person staff

The Beaumont commander oversees the complex, with about 4,000 employees, including about 1,500 military personnel, and an annual budget of about $370 million.

Besides facility challenges, the Beaumont commander also has to deal with frequent hiring freezes and budget constraints, Freeman said.

“So, the current and future environment is one of continued challenges,” Freeman said. “It’s not going to be easy.”

Col. Gray will 'run to the sound of the gun'

Army Brig. Gen. Yolonda “YR” Summons, commander of Medical Readiness Command West, where Gray was chief of staff, said Gray is up to the challenges.

“You’re getting someone who listens deeply, who’s present, who acts decisively, and will always run to the sound of the gun, and (be) an umbrella for when times get tough,” Summons said.

Gray is not only a leader, but also a clinician, Summons said.

Gray started her Army career as a combat medic and later became a nurse and officer in the Army Nurse Corps. She has a master’s degree in nursing as a family nurse practitioner and also is qualified as an aviation flight nurse practitioner.

“She understands the business, of not only Army medicine as it relates to (combat) readiness, but also the Defense Health Agency as it relates to the business of health care,” Summons said.

Gray called Beaumont “a remarkable organization led by dedicated professionals providing top-tier medical care to over 65,000 (military) beneficiaries.”

“I look forward to building on this proud legacy. A cornerstone of military medicine and soldier readiness,” she said.

Gray is married to retired Army First Sgt. Lomack Gray Jr. Their daughter, Taylor Gray, is an Army lieutenant.

Chad Monroe stands accused of conspiracy to commit healthcare fraud and mail fraud, soliciting and receiving healthcare kickbacks, mail fraud, wire fraud, and conspiracy to defraud the United States.

The charges stem from an alleged scheme whereby Monroe and several co-conspirators submitted fake claims to Medicare and TRICARE for medical devices and genetic testing.

A grand jury indictment alleges that Monroe and others created multiple companies while deliberately hiding Monroe's involvement, managerial control, and ownership interest from federal agencies.

Through these companies, Monroe and his co-conspirators allegedly offered kickbacks and bribes to telemedicine companies to have them issue doctor's orders for durable medical equipment – items including orthotics, walkers, canes, etc. The kickbacks, prosecutors say, were concealed via “sham contracts” and “fraudulent invoices” meant to give the veneer of legitimacy to the transfers of funds.

In addition to the fraudulent orders for equipment which were then submitted to Medicare and TRICARE for reimbursement, Monroe also ordered swab kits for genetic testing through similar means, the indictment alleges.

In total, Monroe and others are said to have submitted over $26.5 million in false claims to Medicare, Medicare Advantage plans, and TRICARE, and received over $11 million in reimbursement. Prosecutors say that they also received at least $15 million in bribes and kickbacks from other conspirators for referrals, swab kits, and orders for genetic testing.

The warrant for Monroe's arrest was issued on Monday and was received by territorial authorities on Wednesday, the same day of his arrest. He appeared before U.S. Magistrate Alan Teague that day, and the judge ordered him released on a personal surety bond of $4 million, with 10% payable in cash.

Monroe has since been released and will be required to report to the United States District Court in the Middle District of Florida, Tampa Division, when summoned.",https://viconsortium.nyc3.cdn.digitaloceanspaces.com/uploads/medicare-fraud.jpg,N,0.0,2025-06-26 13:57:18.665393

The world of ketogenic dieting has opened new avenues for people seeking ways to enhance their health, manage weight, and improve overall wellness. As the keto lifestyle has gained popularity, so has the importance of monitoring one’s ketone levels. Ketones are substances produced by the liver when the body breaks down fat for energy instead of carbohydrates. They are an essential indicator of whether the body is in a state of ketosis, which is the goal of many following a ketogenic diet. To ensure accurate readings of these important metabolites, devices like the Keto Mojo have become essential tools for practitioners and dieters alike. However, to ensure these devices provide precise measurements, regular calibration is necessary. Calibration is the process of adjusting the device to guarantee that the readings it provides are accurate, reliable, and trustworthy.

Keto Mojo is a popular and user-friendly blood ketone and glucose testing system that allows individuals to monitor their ketogenic journey effectively. The device offers an easy way to check blood ketone levels using a simple finger-prick method, giving insights into whether you are in ketosis. This continuous monitoring is crucial not only for achieving weight loss goals but also for maintaining energy levels and optimizing overall health while in ketosis. However, if the device is not calibrated correctly, the readings could be misleading, leading to improper dietary choices. Therefore, understanding how to calibrate the Keto Mojo is vital for anyone seriously undertaking a ketogenic lifestyle.

Calibration of this device is not a complicated process, and it can be completed in just three straightforward steps. By adhering to these steps, you can ensure your Keto Mojo provides accurate readings every single time. The importance of calibration goes beyond just getting a correct reading; it influences your day-to-day dietary decisions and helps you understand how your body responds to the ketogenic diet accurately. Without a properly calibrated device, you risk turning your

weight loss effort into an exercise of frustration, resulting in potential ketosis miscalculations and misguided choices. This article delves into the detailed process of calibrating your Keto Mojo, emphasizing the importance of accuracy in ketone testing and providing you with the knowledge to ensure you remain on track with your ketogenic health goals.

Keto Low Carb Crackers Step One: Gather Necessary Supplies

The first step in properly calibrating your Keto Mojo is to gather all the necessary supplies. Calibration requires a few essential components that are integral to ensuring the accuracy of your readings. You will need a working Keto Mojo device, calibration solution, clean strips, and a stable environment for undertaking the calibration. The calibration solution is particularly crucial, as it contains a known concentration of ketones that allows the device to adjust its readings accurately. Ensure that your calibration solution is within its expiration date to avoid any discrepancies in measurements.

Clean strips are another essential component that ensures you get an accurate blood reading. Make sure you are also using high-quality test strips specifically designed for use with the Keto Mojo device. Using outdated or unsupported strips may lead to variances in your test results. A clean and stable environment is required to avoid any external factors that could affect your calibration process. You want to ensure that you are not in a place with extreme temperatures or humidity, which can impact readings. A quiet and distraction-free atmosphere will help you concentrate on the calibration process, increasing your likelihood of success.

Once you’ve gathered your supplies, familiarize yourself with your Keto Mojo device. Review the user manual for any specific calibration instructions that may be unique to your model. Understanding your device’s features, functionality, and maintenance requirements can help you have a smoother calibration experience. It is equally important to ensure that the device’s software is updated and functioning properly, as this could affect its calibr

ation capacity. With your supplies at hand and an understanding of your device in mind, you are well-prepared to move to the next step of the calibration process.

Gifts For Someone On A Keto Diet Step Two: Preparing for Calibration

<pPreparation is key to successful calibration. Before you begin the actual calibration process, make sure that your hands are clean and dry. Any residual substances can potentially interfere with test readings, so thoroughly wash and dry your hands before handling the Keto Mojo device or test strips. It’s also recommended to use the calibration solution at room temperature to ensure it provides the most accurate readings possible. Handling the calibration solution without contaminating it is crucial; avoid touching the nozzle or the tip of the container.

<pNext, set the calibration solution alongside your Keto Mojo and the test strips on a flat, stable surface. Ensure that there is ample lighting, so you can clearly read the screen of your device during the calibration process. Clear your mind of distractions, as focusing on the calibration steps will enhance accuracy and predictability. As you begin the calibration procedure, take it one step at a time, paying close attention to the prompts on the device's scr

een. Read through the instructions thoroughly before starting, ensuring you understand what to expect before proceeding.

<pAnother important aspect of the preparation phase is timing. Choosing a specific time during the day when you can calibrate without interruptions will help create a routine for accuracy. Consider scheduling calibration at intervals that don’t interfere with your regular testing routine, perhaps when you would typically measure ketone levels. This way, calibration becomes part of your regular monitoring process, leading to consistent accuracy. With preparation complete, you are ready to embark on the third step of the calibration process to ensure your Keto Mojo provides accurate readings.

Step Three: Performing the Calibration Clean Eating Recipes For Weight Loss

<pNow you are ready to perform the actual calibration of your Keto Mojo device. Insert a clean test strip into the device, making sure it is seated properly. Once the strip is firmly in place, the device should power on automatically. Follow the prompts on the screen, which may instruct you to apply the calibration solution directly to the test strip. Make sure to use the appropriate amount of calibration solution as indicated on the screen. Typically, a small drop is sufficient, but refer to your device guide for specifics.

<pOnce the calibration solution is applied, the device will start processing the information. This step could take a few seconds, during which you should refrain from touching the device or the calibration solution. After the calibration process is complete, the Keto Mojo should display a reading based on the calibration solution used. Verify that this reading falls within the expected range outlined in your user manual. If the reading is outside of this range or is otherwise inconsistent with what you anticipated, repeat the calibration steps, using a new test strip and a fresh sample of the calibration solution.

<pNever rush the calibration process to save time. Ensuring the accuracy and reliability of your readings is soberly vital to your health and dietary goals. Once calibration is complete and the readings are as expected, dispose of the calibration solution properly, and ensure that your Keto Mojo and work area are clean before storing your device back in a safe, cool, and dry location. Performing the calibration correctly will guarantee you a reliable partner in your ketogenic journey as you continue to monitor your success.

Best Keto Acv Gummies On The Market Common Challenges and Troubleshooting Tips

<pEven with the best preparation and intentions, issues can arise during the calibration process, leading to inaccurate readings or frustration. One of the most common challenges users experience is variability in readings after calibration. If you notice fluctuations in readings, it might indicate that the test strips or calibration solution is faulty or expired. Always check the expiration dates on these components before initiating a calibration to avoid unnecessary confusion.

<pAnother challenge is incorrect application of the calibration solution. Be sure to carefully apply it directly to the test strip; any residuals on your fingers or on the device could affect the outcome. If you suspect this was the case, repeat the calibration procedure with clean hands and fresh components. Additionally, unexpected readings could also be a sign of a malfunctioning device. In this case, consult the user manual for troubleshooting guidance or contact customer support for assistance.

<pLastly, it might happen that your device requires numerous calibration attempts before you achieve consistency. If this is the case, take a moment to pause and troubleshoot. Inspect for any signs of damage to the device or the test strip. Clean the contact points of the device, and recheck for software updates that may provide better calibration results. Consistent monitoring and maintenance of the device will not only enhance its longevity but also improve reading accuracy long-term.

Keto Mcdonalds Chicken Nuggets Frequently Asked Questions About Keto Mojo Calibration

<pAs with any technological device, users often have questions regarding the calibration process, its significance, and general ketone testing. One common question is, “How often should I calibrate my Keto Mojo?” It is generally recommended to calibrate the device whenever you open a new package of test strips, as different lots may have slight variances. Additionally, calibrate the device periodically, such as once a month, even if you continue using the same batch of strips.

<pAnother frequently asked question is, “What should I do if my readings seem inaccurate?” If you suspect inaccurate readings post-calibration, it may be worth repeating the calibration process with fresh strips and solutions. If you notice a continuing trend of discrepancies, consider reaching out to the Keto Mojo customer service team for tailored troubleshooting advice and potential device inspection.

<pLastly, many users wonder, “What does it mean if my device shows ‘Low Battery’ during calibration?” If a low battery message appears, it's crucial to replace the batteries and recalibrate the device to ensure you receive accurate results. Working with a device that has insufficient power can lead to erratic readings and, thus, misinform your dietary strategies. Maintaining a healthy supply of batteries always ensures you can promptly recalibrate and test without interruptions.",https://bigquickly.com/newarticle/img/img1/thumbnail-2025-04-15T141304.072.jpeg,N,0.0,2025-06-26 13:57:22.792431

Mitchell, Nicole Trotta",,,,,https://www.mondaq.com/unitedstates/government-contracts-procurement-ppp/1642820/ofccp-extends-enforcement-moratorium-for-vahbp-providers-until-2027,"The extended moratorium continues to suspend the enforcement of VAHBP providers' requirement to take affirmative steps to ensure equal opportunity without regard to disability or protected veteran status, obligations typically required of federal contractors and subcontractors.
Additionally, VAHBP providers will not be subject to neutral scheduling for compliance evaluations during this period – though all evaluations are currently being held in abeyance.
The moratorium was later expanded to include VAHBP providers.
The current moratorium extension provides additional time for the OFCCP to develop sub-regulatory guidance specifically addressing VAHBP providers.
While the extension offers some regulatory relief, VAHBP providers must remain aware that the moratorium does not exempt them from nondiscrimination obligations.","In a move the Agency reported is designed to maintain healthcare access for active and retired service members and their families, the Office of Federal Contract Compliance Programs (OFCCP) has announced a two-year extension to the enforcement moratorium for Veterans Affairs Health Benefits Program (VAHBP) providers. This extension, effective June 11, 2025, will now run through May 7, 2027.

The extended moratorium continues to suspend the enforcement of VAHBP providers' requirement to take affirmative steps to ensure equal opportunity without regard to disability or protected veteran status, obligations typically required of federal contractors and subcontractors. Additionally, VAHBP providers will not be subject to neutral scheduling for compliance evaluations during this period – though all evaluations are currently being held in abeyance.

Presently, the OFCCP retains authority to investigate discrimination complaints filed under Section 503 of the Rehabilitation Act (Section 503) and the Vietnam Era Veterans' Readjustment Assistance Act (VEVRAA). However, given the current administration's focus on deregulation and the recent proposed budget that would effectively eliminate the OFCCP, this moratorium extension likely reflects the need to address the previous May 2025 expiration date, rather than an indication that the agency is ramping up its activities.

This extension represents the latest in a series of actions dating back to 2014, when the OFCCP first limited its enforcement activities for TRICARE subcontractors in an effort to balance regulatory requirements and veterans' access to healthcare, allowing for more time to consider stakeholder feedback. The moratorium was later expanded to include VAHBP providers. Effective August 31 2020, OFCCP's final rule established that it does not have authority over TRICARE providers. The current moratorium extension provides additional time for the OFCCP to develop sub-regulatory guidance specifically addressing VAHBP providers.

While the extension offers some regulatory relief, VAHBP providers must remain aware that the moratorium does not exempt them from nondiscrimination obligations.

Maybe you’re planning to spend time at the pool, go to a barbecue, or take a vacation. But don’t take a vacation from your health this summer.

“Now can be a great time for you and your family to catch up on preventive health care and take care of other health needs,” said Jeannine Pickrell, M.S., RN, director for Population Health and Disease Management, TRICARE Health Plan, at the Defense Health Agency.

Here are four suggested ways you can use your TRICARE benefits this summer.

1 – Get preventive care

Getting regular preventive care plays a key role in maintaining good health. That’s because preventive services catch problems before you show symptoms. Examples of preventive services include cancer screenings, immunizations, and Health Promotion and Disease Prevention exams.

Which preventive services do you need? Talk to your primary care manager or provider or check out TRICARE’s list of covered preventive services to learn more. Your age, sex, family history, and other risk factors play a role in which services are recommended for you.

You’ll have no out-of-pocket costs for TRICARE covered preventive services if you see a TRICARE network provider, as described in the TRICARE Costs and Fees Sheet. (Active duty service members need pre-authorization to see civilian providers.) TRICARE Prime and TRICARE Select cover one HP&DP exam annually. Learn more about getting preventive care with your TRICARE plan.

2 – Get ready for back to school

Summer is a great time to take care of health checkups for your kids. Your child’s school likely requires students to get an annual health exam and be up to date on vaccines.

TRICARE covers physicals required for school enrollment. Check with your child’s school for their health policy. Depending on these requirements, you may need to schedule more than one office visit for your child, so don’t wait until the last minute to make an appointment.

TRICARE doesn’t cover annual sports physicals, which are separate from school physicals.

Even if your child’s school doesn’t require a physical, kids can still get preventive checkups. Annual HP&DP exams are available to TRICARE enrollees ages 6 and older. TRICARE also covers well-child exams from birth through age 5.

3 – Take care of your eyes

Routine eye exams are designed to monitor your eyesight and catch any eye diseases early.

Your TRICARE health plan may cover routine eye exams. Your vision coverage depends on who you are, your plan, and your age.

Check out these pages for more information about eye exams and vision coverage:

Eye Exams for Active Duty Service Members

Eye Exams for Active Duty Family Members

Eye Exams for National Guard and Reserve Members and Their Families

Eye Exams for Retirees, Their Families, and All Others

Do you need additional vision coverage, like coverage for glasses or contacts? You may be eligible for vision coverage through the Federal Employees Dental and Vision Insurance Program. If you aren’t enrolled in a FEDVIP vision plan, you can enroll following a FEDVIP qualifying life event or during Federal Benefits Open Season each fall. (Keep in mind that FEDVIP QLEs are different from TRICARE QLEs.) Go to BENEFEDS.gov to learn more about FEDVIP eligibility and coverage.

4 – Focus on your mental health

Your mental health is an important part of your overall health and well-being. You don’t need to be in crisis to seek help. Early intervention is key to addressing mental health concerns. Early signs of possible problems may include:

Eating or sleeping too much or too little

Pulling away from people and usual activities

Having low or no energy

Having trouble concentrating

Feeling numb or like nothing matters

Experiencing unexplained aches and pains

Feeling hopeless or helpless

Smoking or drinking more than usual

TRICARE covers a range of mental health services. Services are available whether you’re seeking support for the short or long term. You can start by:

Talking to your PCM—depending on your health plan and the type of care you get, you may need a referral or pre-authorization for mental health care.

Reaching out directly to a TRICARE-authorized provider

Exploring virtual health options to speak with a provider from home
