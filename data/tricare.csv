Why It Matters: According to Jody Duffy, RN, a former Army officer and military spouse of 35 years, the number of abortions among military women is not fully known.","Records from the Defense Health Agency that were shared with The Dallas Express appear to show a massive drop in abortions carried out on military members and their dependents.

Key Takeaways:

Data from the Defense Health Agency show a decline in military abortions between 2021 and the first half of 2025.

In 2022, the Biden administration enacted rules to increase abortion access in the military, including allowing the VA to commit abortions and mandating that the Department of Defense fund abortion travel.

After Trump took office in January, he and his administration began dismantling Biden's pro-abortion policies.

The Details:

In response to a Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) request, on November 20, the Defense Health Agency released data that reflect abortions ""performed or funded consistent with Title 10, United States Code, Section 1093."" Title 10 allows the federal funding of abortions when the child has been conceived in rape or incest or the life of the mother ""would be endangered.""

The records show that both surgical abortions and abortions by pill dropped between 2021 and the first half of 2025. According to TRICARE, there were 35 abortions in private-sector care in 2021, while there were just two from January through June 11, 2025. Direct-care abortions dropped from 14 in 2021 to three in the first half of 2025.

""We know that the Biden administration used every lever at its disposal to push unlimited abortion and this included policy changes in the military,"" The National Right to Life (NRTL) told The Dallas Express. ""Under the Trump administration, policies pushing abortion have been nullified or reversed.""

NRTL explained, “The law is very clear: taxpayer dollars and military facilities cannot be used for elective abortions. When that standard is followed and enforced, it naturally limits the number of abortions performed.”

The Backstory:

After Roe v. Wade was overturned in June 2022, the Biden administration allowed abortions to be commited at VA hospitals for the first time. Among other pro-abortion efforts, Biden also enacted an executive order mandating that the Department of Defense (DOD) fund abortion travel for military members.

The Biden administration claimed that pro-life laws enacted after the fall of Roe amounted to a ""medical emergency."" Dr. Shereef Elnahal, then the VA’s Under Secretary for Health, said the VA must commit abortions and the DOD must fund abortions in order to save women’s lives. Induced abortion — the intentional, targeted killing of a preborn child — is not medically necessary, does not improve maternal mortality or morbidity rates, and is not health care.

At the time, a spokesperson for the VA said the Biden-era policy was “politically motivated. It was estimated that 1,000 abortions would be committed each year under the allowances put into place in 2022; however, there were fewer than 150, according to a VA filing.

After President Trump took office in January and issued an executive order to enforce the Hyde Amendment (which prevents federal funding of certain abortions), the DOD announced it had officially ended Biden's abortion-related travel allowances.

Why It Matters:

According to Jody Duffy, RN, a former Army officer and military spouse of 35 years, the number of abortions among military women is not fully known. Many pregnant service members or spouses will visit the military medical facility to verify they are pregnant, she explained, but they don't return. Instead, they may go to a local abortion facility or wait until they are on leave to have an abortion near home, making it impossible to know how many abortions actually occur among military women.

It is known that there is a great deal of pressure for women in the military to have abortions and get back to being ""good soldiers."" In fact, when asked by the press in 2023 why ""abortion [is] critical to military readiness,"" then-White House National Security Council spokesperson John Kirby said, “Our policies… whether it’s about female service members — one in five — or female family members being able to count on the kinds of health care and reproductive care specifically that they need to serve, that is a foundational sacred obligation of military leaders.”

In other words, it is erroneously believed that women need to have abortions to fulfill their commitment to the U.S. military.

The rate of unplanned pregnancy in the military is actually higher than the rate of unplanned pregnancy among civilians. According to the pro-abortion group Ibis Reproductive Health, there are about 72 unplanned pregnancies per 1,000 women of reproductive age in the military vs. 45 unplanned pregnancies per 1,000 civilian women.

And like the 64% of women who have had abortions say they felt pressured into it, women in the military are under immense pressure to abort. Bethany Soros became pregnant while stationed in Iraq, and her boyfriend broke up with her when she told him. She didn't want to have an abortion, but also knew she'd have no support.

“One of the stigmas attached to a female getting pregnant on a deployment is the assumption that she did it on purpose,” Saros wrote in an essay for Salon. “It’s whispered about any time the word ‘pregnancy’ comes up right before or during a combat tour. The unspoken code is that a good soldier will have an abortion, continue the mission, and get some sympathy because she chose duty over motherhood. But for the woman who chooses motherhood over duty, well, she must have been trying to get out of deployment.”

Duffy explained that an abortion doesn't fix anything for men or women in the military:

The pain and grief of abortion only adds more stress and conflict to their lives. Whether it is the female soldier not wanting to sacrifice her military career or feeling pressured to fulfill her duty, or the male soldier feeling fatherhood may stand in the way of his mission, sacrificing our unborn children to abortion is an unfortunate and frequent reality of military life. Abortion decisions often involve varying degrees of pressure and conflict. This predisposes them to have more intense post abortion reactions and even trauma.

The Bottom Line:

No federal funding should be used to pay for any abortions or abortion expenses. Allowing it to fund the abortions of specific children is discriminatory.

When women are already facing pressure to abort, the government's offer to pay for the abortion is not a source of relief, but further pressure that helps push a woman into an abortion she doesn't want.",https://www.datocms-assets.com/131250/1764434330-gettyimages-165675850.jpg?auto=format&fit=max&w=1200,N,0.0,2025-12-01 18:57:10.191843

After a difficult childhood, she enlisted in the U.S. Air Force in 2005 — helping planes take off but never leaving her lifelong dream behind. A unique program from the Uniformed Services University would take her there.

A turbulent upbringing, a new start

In her youth, she lived with extended family, friends, “moving around from home to home, going to school, working, getting straight A’s, but on my own. It was just wherever I could get support,” she said.

As her mother struggled with mental health challenges, Slimski went to “the hospital with her and watched how supportive the medical people were … every step of the way. Seeing the length that people were going to, to help somebody in need really stuck with me.”

Through that experience, she started developing her passion to help people. “I just wanted to bring it forward and help in other ways. Going to medical school was always my dream.”

She tried college, but “I had no one to look to for any guidance on how to do anything … nobody in my family had ever gone to college. I dropped out after a year and thought, ‘OK, I'll join the Air Force because that kind of seems like a good option for me to jump start.’”

Enlisting in the U.S. Air Force “opened up a lot of doors to me that I don't think I would have known about or even how to pursue,” she said.

She trained as an air traffic controller, a demanding role. “It was a great career. I really enjoyed it because it was fast paced,” she said. “You have to be able to think quickly, process information, and change plans. I always had one thought: ‘Maybe one day I could use this to figure out how to become a doctor.’”

While serving at Nellis Air Force Base, Nevada, and Joint Base Pearl Harbor-Hickam, Hawaii, Slimski took college classes and got a degree in aeronautics. She also took prerequisite medical school coursework but working night shifts and rotating schedules made completing it impossible. Then she read an article about a new program at the Uniformed Services University of the Health Sciences called the Enlisted to Medical Degree Preparatory Program, known as EMDP2.

The highly competitive program is a two-year academic journey towards medical school, designed to help promising, motivated enlisted personnel from across the military services become future military doctors. EMDP2 offers an intensive pre-medical program, mentoring, and Medical College Admission Test preparation. The program also allows service members to maintain their current rank, pay and benefits while going to school full-time at George Mason University’s Prince William County Campus in Virginia.

“As soon as I saw it, I thought it sounded like the perfect program for me because it would solve these issues. I could finish this,” she said.

She applied and was accepted. While eight months pregnant Slimski began school as the first and only woman in the program’s inaugural 2014 class of 10 students.

“It was all men that first year, except for me,” she said. “It just felt like a normal military experience, because a lot of times you end up being the only female.”

Two weeks into the program, she gave birth to her daughter, Kailani. “I ended up taking a week off with the newborn and then played catch-up basically for that week because it is such a rigorous schedule,” Slimski said. Her mother-in-law stepped in to help while her husband, Donald, an air traffic controller himself, was stationed several hours away and then on a remote assignment, so she was able to complete pre-medicine classes with her cohort.

The EMDP2 provided “a much stronger bond” than other preparatory programs, she felt, and “everybody feels like they're connected, and they want other people to succeed and are just very supportive and making sure they can succeed. Honestly, it was pretty incredible.”

She also went to Maxwell Air Force Base, Alabama for commissioned officer training. “I learned about the leadership role, but I'm not really big at leading drills because I really don't have that loud, projecting voice. But I got more leadership focus, so that was more interesting and fun.”

Slimski was accepted into medical school at USU while pregnant with her second daughter, Ellayah, and caring for Kailani and her two stepchildren. While juggling family life and relocating, she credited the program with setting her up for success. “The program was a really good, solid foundation for medical school. They walked us through all of the application steps, so you can check the boxes. It was foolproof.”

Family medicine with purpose

When it came time to select her specialty, Slimski chose family medicine. “Family medicine is really great in that it’s kind of a little bit of everything,” she said.

Slimski, a mother of two and a stepmom, is now a Military Health System family medicine physician with the 1st Special Operations Medical Group - Hurlburt Field, Florida. She cares for active duty service members while supporting high operational demands.

“It’s really rewarding because there is a really high-ops tempo here and … they really do push the mission and readiness,” she said. “I really do enjoy it a lot. It’s challenging.”

Slimski said her enlisted background and an “ingrained” sense to complete the mission has shaped her success in the medical field.

“We have an extra military bearing and realization that what we do has an effect on people and we know how to carry forward. Basically, we know what we’re supposed to do when we’re supposed to do it,” she said. “I think (service members) have more of a deeper understanding of the fact that what they do has an impact in the long run.”

Yet it’s more than just fulfilling mission requirements for Slimski — it’s about resilience in the face of adversity.

“There are a lot of things that can happen throughout our lives, and you can’t really let things hold you back,” she said. “You just have to keep that mindset, no matter what happens and think, ‘I’m going to push myself to move forward. The opportunities are there. You have to go for it.”",https://d1ldvf68ux039x.cloudfront.net/thumbs/photos/2512/9416134/1000w_q95.jpg,N,0.0,2025-12-01 18:57:23.230589

The Breastfeeding Shop and Ms. Gatter will collectively pay the United States $1 million to resolve the allegations.

TRICARE, managed by the Defense Health Agency, is the health care program for U.S. military service members, retirees and their families worldwide. In 2015, the TRICARE program rolled out a new benefit of breast pumps and related equipment for nursing mothers.

The United States alleged that during the early years of the new benefit, The Breastfeeding Shop billed the TRICARE program hundreds of dollars more per breast pump than it charged to the Pennsylvania Medicaid Program, thereby utilizing a prohibited dual fee schedule. The United States also alleged that The Breastfeeding Shop engaged in prohibited “unbundling,” meaning The Breastfeeding Shop would take breast pump accessories that are pre-packaged and included in the standard breast pump kit and then bill TRICARE separately for each item as a replacement part.

“Durable medical equipment suppliers play a vital role in providing safe and effective medical products to patients in need, and especially to our brave service members and their families,” said U.S. Attorney Metcalf. “As alleged, The Breastfeeding Shop and Gatter prioritized their own financial interests through a billing scheme that was to the detriment of the government. This conduct will not be tolerated by my office.”

“Today’s settlement is a direct result of the relationship we have with our partners at the Department of Defense Office of Inspector General’s Audit component and the Department of Justice,” stated Christopher M. Silvestro, Acting Special Agent in Charge of the Defense Criminal Investigative Service Northeast Field Office, the law enforcement arm of the Department of Defense’s (DoD) Office of Inspector General. He further stated, “Fraud involving TRICARE, the healthcare system for military members and their families, is something we take seriously and will investigate fully.”

“Protecting the integrity of the TRICARE program and ensuring responsible stewardship of taxpayer dollars are top priorities for the Defense Health Agency. This settlement sends a clear message that we will not tolerate practices that exploit the program and inflate costs at the expense of our service members, veterans, and their families. Access to essential medical equipment, like breast pumps, is vital for the health and well-being of new mothers and infants within our TRICARE community. We thank the U.S. Attorney’s Office and the Defense Criminal Investigative Service for their continuing dedication to the pursuit of justice,” stated Dr. Glen Diehl, Acting Deputy Director of the Defense Health Agency.

Walter Reed National Military Medical Center is making it easier for patients to schedule specialty care appointments with a new system called proactive booking. This new method is a more efficient and simplified process designed to get patients seen faster.

Launched in September 2025 with Walter Reed’s Orthopedics Department and expanded to include Oncology as of Nov. 1, proactive booking is part of the Walter’s Way initiative to improve access to care and medical readiness.

With this new approach, patients no longer need to call the Integrated Referral Management and Appointment Center (IRMAC) to schedule specialty appointments. Instead, trained bookers review accepted referrals and reach out directly to patients to schedule appointments, including virtual visits when available.

“The goal is to make sure every appointment slot is filled, and that patients get the care they need as quickly as possible,” said Cindy Cruzan, a Walter Reed nurse.

This new process helps Walter Reed ensure that active-duty service members receive timely specialty care while continuing to support retirees and family members.

“This process lets us manage appointments more efficiently,” Cruzan added. “And improves access for everyone.”

More departments are expected to adopt proactive booking in the months ahead as Walter Reed continues to expand efforts that simplify access and enhance patient experience.

The Defense Health Agency supports our Nation by improving health and building readiness—making extraordinary experiences ordinary and exceptional outcomes routine.","Defense Health Agency-Public Health has launched its first-ever Medical Radiation Safety Officer course to ensure a consistent standard of safety for patients and staff across its global network.

The course, which brings together service members and civilians for 40 hours of specialized training, was developed to address a critical gap in standardized training for radiation safety officers, or RSOs, who are responsible for overseeing the safe use of radioactive materials and X-ray-producing devices in military hospitals and clinics.

""A lot of times, a radiation safety officer is appointed by the commander or director as a collateral duty,” said Army Lt. Col. Jodi Santiago, chief of the health physics division at the Defense Centers for Public Health-Aberdeen. “This course provides the training so they can optimally execute their responsibilities.”

While civilian radiation safety courses exist, course developers emphasized that this program is uniquely tailored to the specific needs of DHA.

""We’ve really geared it towards what our military treatment facilities need,"" said Santiago. “The training addresses DHA policies and the military chain of command, aspects not covered in civilian programs.”

Brian Livingston, the DCPH-A Radiation Safety Officer and health physicist who spearheaded the curriculum's development, says the goal is to create a common set of skills and a professional network for RSOs spread across the world.

""Radiation-related incidents may occur at DHA facilities and we need trained (individuals/staff) to respond to these situations,” said Livingston. “We are working to learn from historic incidences to develop best practices to address issues and avoid future occurrences.""

For students, the course offered crucial insights, especially for those transitioning from other radiation safety fields. Navy Lt. Jeffrey Divis, a radiation health officer with an extensive background in industrial and naval nuclear programs, attended to bridge knowledge gaps for his new role in a medical center.

""I've been an RSO before, not on the medical side,"" said Divis. ""This course addresses my medical radiation safety program needs.” Other attendees found the course helped them refine their current practices.

""It's given me some things to go back and look at now that I've been doing the job for a year,"" said Jason Fewkes from Madigan Army Medical Center, located at Joint Base Lewis-McChord in Washington. “It really helps me refocus where I should be and take a look at how I can make things better.”

The comprehensive curriculum, which includes hands-on training with various radiation detection instruments, was highly praised by participants.

Army 1st Lt. Adrien Giuliano, a nuclear medical science officer at the Eisenhower Army Medical Center located at U.S. Army Fort Gordon, Georgia, was so impressed that he thinks the course should be mandatory for all new military health physicists.

""Everything we've gone over so far is really in-depth,"" said Giuliano. “I shared in one of my class evaluations that this course would benefit any new military health physicist.”

The course's instructors are a mix of experienced civilian certified health physicists and military nuclear medical science officers, who bring real-world experience from inspecting and managing military hospitals and clinics. They all have a simple, but vital, goal.

“My ultimate goal is that the course helps ensure the health and safety of patients and workers,"" said Jerry Falo, a DCPH-A health physicist. “I want to give the students some knowledge and information they can take back to their facilities and use in running their programs. I also hope to learn something from them so I can do an even better job supporting them here.”

The course organizers are gathering feedback to refine the program, with plans to offer it in the future and potentially take it on the road to other facilities, Santiago said.

Female breast cancer accounted for the highest cancer incidence rate for the ten leading cancers among active-duty members of the military between 2018 and 2022. Innovative research funded by the BCRP contributes to high-impact advances in clinical practice and treatment used within the Military Health System. Continued breast cancer research gives hope to current and future members of the military, and helps Warfighters stay mission-ready while knowing their Families receive the best care available.

According to data provided by the Defense Medical Surveillance System of the Defense Health Agency, on average, the Military Health System provided care for 67,739 women and 507 men for invasive breast cancer annually between 2015 and 2024, including an average of 420 active-duty military members each year. For females 40-59 years of age, the incidence rate of breast cancer is https://doi.org/10.1002/cncr.34978 in Service Members compared to the general population.

Environmental Exposures and Breast Cancer Risk Among Military Women

Throughout their service, members of the military may experience environmental exposures to substances that can increase the risk of developing cancer. The Department of Veterans Affairs recognizes female breast cancer as a presumptive cancer related to burn pit exposure.

In fiscal year 2019, the BCRP funded a Breakthrough Award – Funding Level 2 – Population Science and Prevention Studies – Partnering Principal Investigator Option, led by Celia Byrne, Ph.D., at the Uniformed Services University of the Health Sciences, and Mary Beth Terry, Ph.D., at Columbia University, to investigate the association between environmental exposures and breast cancer risk for women serving in the military.

“For our project, CDMRP funding has been critical in supporting research into the reasons why young, active-duty military women are experiencing an increase in early onset breast cancer,” Byrne and Terry said. “CDMRP’s emphasis on the need for innovative and novel approaches to studying breast cancer risk allowed us to design a study to evaluate the impact of environmental determinants of breast cancer and the potential for impact of exposures that, while common in the civilian population, may be more prevalent with military service.”

Byrne and Terry’s study builds on existing resources within the Department of Defense. The team identifies cases of breast cancer diagnoses in active-duty women using the DOD’s Cancer Registry, a registry documenting tumors and cancers across the Military Health System. Then, the researchers obtain pre-diagnostic serum samples from the same individuals through the DOD’s Serum Repository, which stores blood samples collected from active-duty military members. To date, the researchers identified over 850 breast cancer cases from the cancer repository.

By combining biospecimens and other data, including genetic information and blood-based biomarkers of environmental exposures, the researchers aim to answer longstanding questions regarding potential associations between environmental exposures and risk of breast cancer in specific populations.

“Rather than only looking at genetic factors alone, we must consider how women at higher genetic risk of developing breast cancer might be more susceptible to the influences of these environmental exposures,” Byrne and Terry said.

Triple-Negative Breast Cancer Vaccine Advances to Clinical Trials

Triple-negative breast cancer, an aggressive subtype associated with fast-growing tumors that often spread to other parts of the body, accounts for approximately https://acsjournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.3322/caac.21863 of all breast cancers. This subtype represents a larger proportion of breast cancers among younger women, including the age range for active-duty military service, compared to other age groups. Triple-negative breast cancer lacks estrogen receptors, progesterone receptors and large amounts of HER2/neu protein commonly used as targets for the treatment of other breast cancer subtypes, limiting treatment options.

In fiscal year 2016, the BCRP funded a Breakthrough Award – Funding Level 3 – Clinical Trial – Partnering Principal Investigator Option, led by the late Vincent Tuohy, Ph.D., George Budd, M.D., and Thaddeus Stappenbeck, M.D., Ph.D., at the Cleveland Clinic, to conduct a phase 1 clinical trial testing a vaccine for triple-negative breast cancer. The vaccine generates an immune response to alpha-lactalbumin, a milk protein expressed in the breast during late pregnancy and lactation. Most triple-negative breast cancers express high levels of alpha-lactalbumin, making this protein a potential target for treatment or prevention.

The investigators aim to determine the best dose and safety of the vaccine in females recently diagnosed with triple-negative breast cancer who recovered from current standard of care therapy. The researchers also test the vaccine in healthy subjects who elected prophylactic mastectomy because of their familial risk for breast cancer.

“CDMRP's BCRP has been a vital source of funding for studies of novel approaches to breast cancer treatment and prevention,” Budd said. “Thanks to the CDMRP, we have been able to perform a first-in-human trial of a vaccine designed to prevent or treat breast cancer.”

With an early phase clinical trial underway, the research team’s work will inform the next set of clinical trials, demonstrating potential to move new treatments and preventative approaches to patients.

Improving Care in the Military Health System

Since the program’s inception in 1992, BCRP-funded research contributed to the development of digital mammography and digital breast tomosynthesis, also known as 3D mammogram, now adopted as the standard of care for breast imaging and breast cancer detection across all health care sectors, including those where Service Members and their Families seek care.

According to data provided by the DHA Pharmacy Operations Division, Military Health Service providers filled more than 132,900 prescriptions between 2007 and 2024 for FDA-approved drugs developed in part by BCRP-funded research: abemaciclib, palbociclib, ribociclib and trastuzumab.

In 2023, the DHA expanded a genetic testing pilot program for Service Members and their Families to include the Breast Cancer Index®. Research funded by the BCRP contributed to the development of this prognostic test that evaluates the likelihood of recurrence and benefit from extended anti-estrogen therapy.

Kara Kenan, a disabled U.S. Air Force Veteran due to breast cancer diagnosis, received the Breast Cancer Index test after experiencing side effects from anti-estrogen therapy during the first five years after breast cancer treatment.

“I finally had the Breast Cancer Index test, which indicated I wasn't really getting any additional benefit from continuing on hormonal treatments. I was able to come off of [the treatment], and my body was really grateful because that treatment was really difficult.” Kenan said.

Kenan served as a fiscal year 2024 BCRP peer reviewer, sharing her experiences to help ensure funded research addresses the concerns and need of patients, including Service Members and Veterans.

“I think we are in a renaissance of what is happening with cancer treatments and diagnostics,” Kenan said. “There's so much going on right now, and it is all so very exciting.”",https://cdn.dvidshub.net/images/dvids_logo.svg,N,0.0,2025-12-01 07:56:40.212528

Thousands of providers were not paid on time throughout the country, said Eileen Huck with the National Military Families Association.
""But I think what we may see is that providers are limiting the number of Tricare patients that they'll accept, or just deciding that they won't accept new Tricare patients.""
For 2026, most Tricare health plan costs for military families and retirees will go up between 2% and 3% next year.
The charges are in line with what Tricare patients have seen over the last several years, Huck said.","For the first half of 2025, mental health providers in Hampton Roads complained that the military health insurance Tricare was not paying providers on time.

Ramsey Goshert with Mission Harbor Counseling in Virginia Beach was one of several mental health counseling services in the area who did not get paid on time for several months by the contractors hired by the Defense Health Agency to run Tricare. Payments are now arriving on time, but the billing issues put a strain on providers and patients, he said.

The larger issue is because of Tricare's ""completely insulting reimbursement rates, many providers are no longer participating,"" Goshert said. ""This is making it increasingly difficult for Tricare beneficiaries to find a provider, especially therapy.""

Changes in Tricare administration at the start of the year contributed to the issues. A new contractor, TriWest Healthcare Alliance, was put in place to run the western part of the country.

Humana Military, which administers Tricare in the eastern part of the country, changed the subcontractor which handles their claims. Thousands of providers were not paid on time throughout the country, said Eileen Huck with the National Military Families Association.

Mental health providers, some of which didn't see payments for several months, were hit particularly hard, she said.

""A small mental health provider or speech therapist or physical therapist, somebody who's seeing a patient multiple times over the course of a few weeks or months,"" she said. ""If they're not getting reimbursed, that's really something that they just can't sustain.""

NMFA is one of the groups that pushed Congress to place language in the new defense bill that will require DHA to report on what caused the 2025 Tricare delays.

""I don't know where the breakdown occurred, but I think that it's on DHA to make sure that they are exercising very close oversight during what is a very complicated process,"" she said.

Many of the payment delays were resolved by the second half of the year, but not before causing massive disruption for the 9.4 million troops, military families and retirees around the country which use Tricare, she said.

""When I ask if they are seeing providers leave the network, they have consistently said that they are not seeing that,"" Huck said. ""But I think what we may see is that providers are limiting the number of Tricare patients that they'll accept, or just deciding that they won't accept new Tricare patients.""

And cost increases are coming for families as well. For 2026, most Tricare health plan costs for military families and retirees will go up between 2% and 3% next year. The price of prescription drugs will increase more than 15%. The charges are in line with what Tricare patients have seen over the last several years, Huck said.

""Certainly anytime there's a cost increase, especially when the cost of living is already so high, and we know a lot of families are struggling financially, the last thing we want to see is, you know, struggling to afford health care.""

The Role 4 Modeling Tool will serve as an enterprise predictive planning system for the Defense Health Agency and medical planners across the combatant commands. The tool will support large-scale casualty flow planning by identifying available specialized care across military treatment facilities and other designated National Disaster Medical System sites.

“This award marks a significant step forward in supporting the Department of War and the Joint Force in their combat support missions, particularly in planning scenarios related to large-scale combat operations,” said Core4ce’s Vice President of Advanced IT Solutions Stevyn Buie. “The development of the Role 4 Medical Modeling and Simulation Tool will better enable DHA to model casualty flow across MTFs, the U.S. Department of Veteran Affairs, the private sector, and activated National Disaster Medical System facilities.”

Core4ce’s modeling and simulation teams have a strong record of applying advanced analytics and machine learning to deliver actionable insights. In work for NIWC Atlantic and the Program Executive Office for Defense Healthcare Management Systems, the company developed a Biosurveillance Hub & Portal proof of concept to detect, analyze and track potential biothreats through predictive modeling. The effort focused on building predictive threat models and tailored biosurveillance tools to improve decision-making and strengthen operational effectiveness.

To get Tricare doula coverage, work with OBGYNs and CNMs who accept Tricare and have a participation agreement.
Childbirth and Breastfeeding Support Tricare benefits cover breastfeeding support services and demonstrations.
When hiring a Tricare doula, talk to them about your partner's current work situation.
Doulas may take other specific trainings, such as LGBTQ+ doulas, abortion doulas, and more.","The easy answer? Yes, Tricare-authorized doulas are an option when giving birth as a military spouse or as someone with Tricare. If you are giving birth at a military hospital or clinic, this information does not apply to you. Unfortunately, if you are at a military hospital or clinic, you cannot get coverage for certified labor doulas.

A Tricare doula doesn’t necessarily mean that you have coverage. To get Tricare doula coverage, work with OBGYNs and CNMs who accept Tricare and have a participation agreement. To find a Tricare authorized doula, please reach out to me via email.

I keep a list of Tricare-authorized doulas organized by location. If you plan to give birth in Southeast CT or in Charleston, SC, I have you covered. Whether you plan to give birth at home or in a hospital, many of these doulas have experience with both options.

Childbirth and Breastfeeding Support

Tricare benefits cover breastfeeding support services and demonstrations. They also include doula support during childbirth. You can get up to 8 hours of visits before or after birth. Whether you’re 20 weeks pregnant, 27 weeks pregnant, or 36 weeks pregnant, you can always benefit from a certified labor doula.

During your prenatal or postnatal care, you can schedule up to 8 hours of visits, split into 15-minute increments. This support could include working on birth plans, labor and delivery education, breastfeeding support, and more. Tricare childbirth and breastfeeding coverage plans are to expand even more after December 31, 2026.

Through Tricare, you can also receive coverage for breastfeeding counseling through lactation consultants or lactation counselors. Coverage may not include IBCLCs, but working with a lactation counselor or consultant is important for postpartum support.

Benefits of Working with a Tricare Doula for Military Spouses

My daughter is the child of someone who is Active Duty, and this specific topic is important to me. Giving birth alone can be an isolating experience, and one that I had my own journey with. For military spouses, working with a Tricare authorized doula is critical in my eyes. It protects you from being alone during the birthing process. And having a doula present means someone is always there, focused on you.

Whether your partner is deployed, working state-side, out to sea, or what have you, it can be tricky to ensure your partner will be there for the birth of your child. Working with a doula ensures you have someone there, focused on you, who can also help navigate notifying your spouse or trying to reach their command. Either way, when a doula is free through Tricare, to me, this is a no-brainer.

When hiring a Tricare doula, talk to them about your partner's current work situation. With your doula, have a conversation about what their day-to-day might look like in the two weeks before or after your due date—ensure to always remember OPSEC.

You may notify their ombudsman or similar that the doula may be calling with an update, and what the doula’s name and phone number are. You can also create a group chat with your partner and doula once you hit 36 weeks to notify them both of your progress.

Specialized Labor and Post Partum Doulas

The birthing event itself can be supported by a doula, but did you know that there are specialized doulas? The National Black Doulas Association offers doula support for BIPOC folks. Doulas may take other specific trainings, such as LGBTQ+ doulas, abortion doulas, and more. If it matters to you that a doula has special experience or training, ask them about it.

Great questions to ask in the interview process include the following:

How do most of your clients benefit from working with you?

What are the common struggles for your clients?

Do you have personal experience giving birth? How does that come up in your work as a doula?

How long have you been a Tricare authorized doula?

Do you offer breastfeeding support demonstrations?

What is your favorite part about being a doula?

What got you interested in becoming a doula?

How did you choose your doula training program?",https://assets.squarespace.com/universal/default-favicon.ico,N,1.0,2025-11-29 18:56:21.426183

TRICARE Costs and Key Charges

Understanding the TRICARE cost is highly effective because every plan is associated with specific charges, which directly influence how the better and their family members pay for care:

How to Enroll in TRICARE

Verify the eligibility before moving ahead with TRICARE enrollment or benefits:

Ensure that your DEERS information is accurate, and then head towards the milConnect portal.

Explore the selected plan’s tools, such as the Plan Finder, to compare the plans to understand which plan fits into your status as well as your needs.

Once you pick a relevant plan, go to the tab of Beneficiaries Web Enrollment, which is BWE, to submit the enrollment or by the purchase prompt.

If you require any help, then you can contact the offline helpline support number, which is 800-538-9552 to confirm eligibility.

Choosing TRICARE Insurance Guide for Veterans & Families

Begin by understanding which beneficiary categories completely align with your situation so that you can understand what the available plans are for you:

If they are active duty members, they can utilize the official TRICARE tool, which is a Plan Finder, to understand their eligibility by providing a zip code as well as sponsorship information.

An applicant belonging to active duty families or those who have newly added can ensure that their DEERS information is updated.

As for Active duty applicants the initial enrollment is often automatic, but still the plan changes within the span of 90 days.

Once you finalize your plan selection, enrollment will be done through the milConnect WEB portal or even via through mail or phone as per the region’s guidance.

Once enrolled it is always advisable to check the network directory of your region, whether East or West, to confirm which military or civilian hospitals or clinics are covered under this plan.

Getting TRICARE Healthcare Services for Members

TRICARE members can get significant access to care at medical facilities or even approved clinical providers as managed by the Department of Defense. The availability is exceptionally dependent on the location and beneficiary category as well as the plan type.

It also makes sure that TRICARE’s dental, medical, and vision as well as pharmacy offerings remain available globally, which gets the regional partner support.
