The telehealth firm has deployed scheduled virtual visits across the Military Health System, executives said in an earnings call Thursday.
Dive Insight: Amwell has been working to right its financial ship after years of losses and a threat to its listing status last year.
Last summer, Amwell implemented a reverse stock split to consolidate the number of existing shares and boost its stock price.
Analysts peppered Amwell with questions about the defense contract’s renewal, given the deal is scheduled to last only through July.","Dive Brief:

Amwell narrowed its losses on growing revenue in the first quarter as the telehealth vendor continued to roll out products as part of a contract with the Department of Defense.

The company posted a net loss of $18.4 million, down from $73.4 million in the prior-year period. Amwell reported revenue of $66.8 million, compared with $59.5 million in the first quarter last year.

The telehealth firm has deployed scheduled virtual visits across the Military Health System, executives said in an earnings call Thursday. However, rollouts for its automated and digital behavioral health programs will take place in the third quarter instead of the second due to leadership changes at the Defense Health Agency, leaders said.

Dive Insight:

Amwell has been working to right its financial ship after years of losses and a threat to its listing status last year.

The vendor was warned by the New York Stock Exchange last April that it could be delisted because its stock price was trading below the minimum standard. Last summer, Amwell implemented a reverse stock split to consolidate the number of existing shares and boost its stock price.

The company is now looking to reach positive cash flow by 2026, a goal the company made “significant progress” toward in the first quarter, CEO Ido Schoenberg said on the earnings call.

One major project for Amwell is its defense contract. The company, along with technology firm Leidos, first received a deal worth up to $180 million in late 2023 to replace the military’s telehealth product with Amwell’s.

Software revenue grew over 30% year over year due to strategic deployments, including the go-live across the Military Health System, “the most significant growth initiative in our company's history,” CFO and COO Mark Hirschhorn said on the call.

Analysts peppered Amwell with questions about the defense contract’s renewal, given the deal is scheduled to last only through July. But executives said they were confident the deal would be extended in the coming months. Service members can already access scheduled virtual visits through Amwell, and the company believes the government and Leidos are happy with results, Schoenberg said.

“The audience for our project is huge. It’s 9.6 million people in the military, including the men and women in uniform and their families,” he said.

Amwell’s earnings call comes as economic uncertainty and tariffs have weighed on the bottom lines of other companies in the healthcare sector, including medical technology firms.

Amwell likely won’t face significant challenges from tariffs though, as hardware is now a small part of their business, Schoenberg said. The economic uncertainty could be a boon, as customers could view Amwell products as a way to grow efficiency and revenue, he added.

“People are uncertain, and people are worried when they think about their financial viability going forward. That includes many of our customers,” he said. “The encouraging part is that they see us as part of the solution to this issue.”",https://imgproxy.divecdn.com/mXGjYhCQYEE8HZ91czunxEQp0ZfHOcuk_tMp83nqkkw/g:ce/rs:fit:770:435/Z3M6Ly9kaXZlc2l0ZS1zdG9yYWdlL2RpdmVpbWFnZS9BbXdlbGxfRGV2aWNlcy1Db25zdW1lci1pUGhvbmUtRGVzay1WaXNpdC1Xb21hbi5qcGc=.webp,N,0.0,2025-05-02 17:56:16.969418

The new grade for spring 2025 is a national recognition for commitment to patient safety.

The Leapfrog Hospital Safety Grade stands as the only hospital ratings program focused solely on preventable medical errors, infections and injuries that kill more than 500 patients a day in the United States. This program is peer-reviewed, fully transparent and free to the public.

Grades are updated twice annually, in the fall and spring.

“We at CRDAMC are proud to have earned an “A” Leapfrog Hospital Safety Grade. This is in recognition of our achievements in and focus on protecting our patients from preventable harm and error in the hospital,” said Col. Garrick Cramer, commander, CRDAMC. “This honor belongs to the entire CRDAMC team who are dedicated to protecting patients from harm and meeting the highest safety standards in the United States.”

CRDAMC, a level III trauma center that serves Soldiers, retirees, and their family members for the Fort Cavazos Central Texas surrounding community, was among 16 military hospitals that received an “A” rating in the Leapfrog Group “A” Hospital Safety Grade assessment.

The Defense Health Agency included the Leapfrog group surveys in the Military Health System’s Quality Assurance Program to help validate quality of care and identify opportunities for improvement.

“These most recent Leapfrog Safety Grades continue to validate DHA’s commitment to meeting

high standards for the patients we are privileged to serve, said Dr. Paul Cordts, DHA Deputy Assistant Director for Medical Affairs and Chief Medical Officer. “We are proud that the care provided at CRDAMC ranks among the very best in the nation.”

“Achieving an ‘A’ Hospital Safety Grade reflects enormous dedication to patient safety,” said Leah Binder, president and CEO of The Leapfrog Group. “I extend my congratulations to CRDAMC, its leadership, clinicians, staff and volunteers for creating a culture where patients come first.”

TRICARE does have some limitations and exclusions in its mental health coverage that active duty service members should be aware of.
While active duty members typically face fewer restrictions than family members, some specialized treatments may require periodic reviews to continue coverage.
While these limitations exist, active duty service members have robust coverage compared to many civilian plans, and medical necessity is the primary consideration.
Yes, there are several specialized mental health programs for active duty military members.","For those serving our country, having reliable healthcare is not just a benefit—it’s a fundamental necessity that acknowledges their sacrifice and commitment to national security. TRICARE for active duty military service members and their families, provides essential healthcare coverage to serve as a critical support system during and after deployment.

The comprehensive health benefits program ensures military personnel can access necessary medical care without a financial burden, allowing them to focus on their mission rather than healthcare costs. Access to mental health insurance in Los Angeles through TRICARE is particularly vital for military personnel who face unique psychological challenges from combat exposure, frequent relocations, and family separations.

When service members have ready access to quality mental health services—including therapy, medication management, and crisis intervention—they’re better equipped to maintain operational readiness and overall well-being. Removing barriers to mental healthcare helps reduce stigma, encourages early intervention, and ultimately strengthens both individual resilience and military effectiveness.

For urgent situations, service members can go to any emergency room without prior authorization. TRICARE also offers telehealth mental health appointments, which have become increasingly available.

Active duty members should be aware that their command does not need to be notified about routine mental health appointments, though certain duty-limiting conditions may require disclosure. The Military Crisis Line (988, Press 1) provides confidential support for those in crisis and is available 24/7 via phone, text, or chat.

TRICARE does have some limitations and exclusions in its mental health coverage that active duty service members should be aware of.

TRICARE generally doesn’t cover certain types of therapy approaches considered experimental, investigational, or unproven. This may include some alternative or complementary treatments like equine therapy, art therapy, or certain holistic approaches, unless they’re part of an approved comprehensive treatment plan.

There are sometimes limits on the number of sessions for certain types of care without additional authorization. While active duty members typically face fewer restrictions than family members, some specialized treatments may require periodic reviews to continue coverage.

Coverage may be limited for care received from non-network providers, especially without proper referrals. Active duty members are generally required to use military treatment facilities first when available, and seeking outside care without authorization could result in denied claims.

TRICARE doesn’t typically cover educational or vocational counseling, marital counseling that isn’t medically necessary for treating a diagnosed condition or testing for academic placement. Services primarily focused on lifestyle coaching rather than treating mental health conditions may also be excluded.

For certain conditions like substance use disorders, there may be specific pathways of care that must be followed, beginning with appropriate assessment and following established treatment guidelines. Deviating from these pathways could affect coverage.

While these limitations exist, active duty service members have robust coverage compared to many civilian plans, and medical necessity is the primary consideration. The military has also established various supplemental programs to fill potential gaps in coverage.

Yes, there are several specialized mental health programs for active duty military members.

The Military’s Embedded Behavioral Health (EBH) program places mental health professionals directly within military units, providing easier access to care and reducing stigma. These providers understand unit-specific stressors and can offer tailored support while building rapport with service members.

For combat-related trauma, specialized PTSD treatment programs exist at many military treatment facilities and VA centers. These include evidence-based therapies like Prolonged Exposure Therapy, Cognitive Processing Therapy, and EMDR specifically adapted for military experiences.

The inTransition program provides specialized coaching and support for service members transitioning between duty stations and healthcare systems or preparing for separation from service, critical periods when mental health support is particularly important.

Military OneSource offers confidential nonmedical counseling services separate from the medical record system, allowing members to address issues before they require clinical intervention without concerns about career impact.

For substance use concerns, the military operates specialized Substance Use Disorder Clinical Care programs that understand the unique aspects of addiction in the military context.

Suicide prevention programs like the DoD’s Suicide Prevention Office coordinate training, risk assessment tools, and intervention strategies specifically designed for military populations.

Also, deployment-specific mental health programs exist to address the unique stressors of pre-deployment preparation, deployment operations, and post-deployment reintegration, including combat operational stress control teams.",https://momentofclarity.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/MOC-Default-Social-Share-1.1.jpg,N,0.0,2025-05-02 15:56:41.767943

These high grades reflect the DHA's ongoing dedication to transparency and providing high-quality care to service members and their families.

The Leapfrog Group is a national, independent organization focused on health care quality. The organization evaluates hospitals on a wide range of safety measures, including errors, injuries, and infections. Leapfrog's grading system uses up to 22 evidence-based measures of patient safety.

A hospital must meet specific criteria to be eligible for participation in the Leapfrog safety assessment. In the Spring 2025 ratings, 32% of participating hospitals nationwide received the highest grade. Of the eligible military hospitals participating in the grading assessment, 73% received an ""A"" grade.

""These most recent Leapfrog Safety Grades continue to validate DHA’s commitment to meeting high standards for the patients we are privileged to serve,"" said Dr. Paul Cordts, DHA's Deputy Assistant Director for Medical Affairs and Chief Medical Officer. ""We are proud that the care provided at these facilities ranks among the very best in the nation.""

DHA's engagement with Leapfrog began about seven years ago when it sought to incorporate Leapfrog's evaluations into the Military Health System's Quality Assurance Program. Walter Reed National Military Medical Center was the first military test site for Leapfrog surveys. After seeing positive results, DHA expanded the program across other eligible military hospitals.

""Our participation in this program showcases the consistent rigor our teams apply to safe, effective health care delivery."" said Cordts. "" We are proud of our medical teams’ effort to meet the quality and safety metrics that Leapfrog has set.""

The Leapfrog Hospital Safety Grade program, updated twice a year, evaluates public and private hospitals. Its grades are based on national standards for hospital safety and highlight risks that patients may face in a health care setting, including preventable medical errors and infections. The ratings are available to the public, making it easier for patients to understand the safety standards of their local health care facilities.

The 16 military hospitals that received an “A” grade in Spring 2025 are:

81st Medical Group, Keesler Air Force Base, Mississippi

673rd Medical Group, Joint Base Elmendorf-Richardson, Alaska

Alexander T. Augusta Military Medical Center, Fort Belvoir, Virginia

Blanchfield Army Community Hospital, Fort Campbell, Kentucky

Brooke Army Medical Center, Fort Sam Houston, Texas

Carl R. Darnall Army Medical Center, Fort Cavazos, Texas

Eisenhower Army Medical Center, Fort Eisenhower, Georgia

Evans Army Community Hospital, Fort Carson, Colorado

Madigan Army Medical Center, Joint Base Lewis-McChord, Washington

Naval Medical Center Camp Lejeune, Camp Lejeune, North Carolina

Naval Medical Center Portsmouth, Portsmouth, Virginia

Naval Medical Center San Diego, San Diego, California

Walter Reed National Military Medical Center, Bethesda, Maryland

William Beaumont Army Medical Center, Fort Bliss, Texas

U.S. Naval Hospital Guam, Guam

Some military hospitals were not included in the safety grades this spring because they did not meet the minimum requirements for reporting criteria used by Leapfrog. The DHA has instituted similar criteria internally to ensure patient safety for all facilities that did not qualify for official Leapfrog grades.

""We remain steadfast in our commitment to regular and transparent reporting about the quality of DHA’s health care,"" said Cordts.

Her efforts contributed significantly to the mission accomplishment and effectiveness of Naval Hospital Bremerton.” Overseeing the Uniform Business Office is more than just tabulating statistics on a ledger or totaling column figures.
“Medical services account activities involve billing and collecting funds for medical and dental services, including elective cosmetic procedures provided in DHA facilities.
All recovered collections are directed back the command which provided the services,” Tellez said.","The Defense Health Agency Revenue Cycle Performance Dashboard Digest devoted the April monthly newsletter on timely trends and updated data points across the entire enterprise of military treatment facilities.

Yet beyond the balance sheets, billing, and coding overviews was a brief personality feature of a civil service employee emblematic of ensuring all such resource management and collection needs are correctly – and timely - administered.

Meet Ms. Elizabeth Tellez, Naval Hospital Bremerton Uniform Business Office supervisory financial management analyst.

When asked about the DHA feature, Tellez replied, “During my time as UBO manager, NHB has been, and continues to be, the leader amongst all service-wide UBO offices for accurate and timely compliance audit sampling. This is a direct reflection of the quality of work and revenue collected by our department.”

Tellez began her career at the then Naval Hospital Oak Harbor in 2006 as a contract medical coder auditor and documentation trainer. She became part of federal civil service in 2008, assigned to the now Naval Health Clinic Oak Harbor Uniform Business Office.

“I wanted the opportunity to serve the American public and make an impact on the military service communities,” said Tellez, a El Paso, Texas native, El Paso High School 1986 grad, and Shoreline Community College 2016 alumni with an Associate of Applied Arts and Sciences – Health Information Technology degree.

In June 2016, she was promoted and reassigned to her current position at NHB. Tellez has also been acknowledged for her outstanding service, cited for her “commitment to excellence, professionalism, and dedication to her duties. Her efforts contributed significantly to the mission accomplishment and effectiveness of Naval Hospital Bremerton.”

Overseeing the Uniform Business Office is more than just tabulating statistics on a ledger or totaling column figures.

“The Uniform Business Office ensures that billable medical and pharmacy services are identified, insurance payer information is available, accurate and complete billing claims are generated, and appropriate collections are received, directly back to the military treatment facility,” explained Tellez on the importance of her office to NHB. “Together, three cost recovery programs - third party billing, medical service accounts and medical affirmative claim programs - provide the business processes for cost recovery including collections control, accounts receivable, and deposits.”

According to Tellez, Title 10, United States Code (U.S.C.) Section 1095 authorizes military treatment facilities to recover the cost of providing health care services to covered DoD beneficiaries from third party payers.

“Medical services account activities involve billing and collecting funds for medical and dental services, including elective cosmetic procedures provided in DHA facilities. Medical affirmative claims activities involve billing all areas of liability insurance. All recovered collections are directed back the command which provided the services,” Tellez said.

Tellez leads managing all NHB’s billing, collections, and data accuracy to ensure effective healthcare cost recovery and financial accountability. She works to improve and maximize third-party reimbursements from various insurance providers and identify and implement process improvements to enhance efficiency and accuracy within the UBO.

“My team and I daily research, analyze, and report issues based upon reporting tool results,” remarked Tellez. “[as an example] We recently discovered a systematic issue that was holding up possible reimbursement of $81,000.”

“Systematic issues can be very challenging to work through, however finding a resolution is a bonus not only for the command, but for the entire enterprise,” added Tellez, also noting it has been gratifying to share problem solving techniques, work processes and corrective measures with her DHA UBO counterparts.

Tellez attests the best part about her career is not the financial facts and fiscal figures. “It’s being able to make work-related friendships along the way that extend miles across land and sea,” she said.

When asked to sum up her experience at NHB’s in one sentence, Tellez stated, “Teamwork. Go Navy!”",https://d1ldvf68ux039x.cloudfront.net/thumbs/photos/2505/9010255/1000w_q95.jpg,N,0.0,2025-05-02 14:56:28.657129

Reviewer 1 Report

Comments and Suggestions for Authors

This is a well written article that makes use of a unique dataset to provide information on rotavirus hospitalizations and vaccination before and during the COVID-19 pandemic. It is a worthwhile analysis that will be of interest to readers. That said, there are significant limitations to the methods description and implementation that must be addressed before it should be considered for publication.

This analysis is undertaken as a cohort study, however the cohort is not adequately described in the methods. What happens to children who were not followed for the full time period? How was the population calculated in situations where children moved between regions mid-year?

The description and interpretation of rates of vaccination is wholly inadequate. What the denominator for monthly vaccination rates? It would be useful to also present the birth cohort rotavirus vaccination coverage at 12-23 months of age to allow for comparison with other data sources such as NIS. Finally, it would be interesting to look at timeliness of vaccination in this population as the upper age restrictions for rotavirus vaccine have been hypothesized to impact coverage, especially when compared with other routine infant vaccines.

You used ICD 10 codes to determine rotavirus in the absence of testing, the sensitivity and specificity of which are not great (Pindyck T, Hall AJ, Tate JE, Cardemil CV, Kambhampati AK, Wikswo ME, Payne DC, Grytdal S, Boom JA, Englund JA, Klein EJ. Validation of acute gastroenteritis-related international classification of diseases, clinical modification codes in pediatric and adult US populations. Clinical Infectious Diseases. 2020 May 23;70(11):2423-7.) While you do address this in the limitations, the analysis would be stronger if rates of acute gastroenteritis of any cause were also included. There are several models in the literature of how this can be done (Baker JM, Dahl RM, Cubilo J, Parashar UD, Lopman BA. Effects of the rotavirus vaccine program across age groups in the United States: analysis of national claims data, 2001–2016. BMC infectious diseases. 2019 Dec;19:1-1.)

That said, there are significant limitations to the methods description and implementation that must be addressed before it should be considered for publication.""

Response 1: Thank you for this very positive feedback! Our team worked together to create this study, write the initial manuscript, and now improve our manuscript so that it meets the desired level of academic rigor worthy of publication. We appreciate your help in making this happen.

Comment 2: ""This analysis is undertaken as a cohort study, however the cohort is not adequately described in the methods. What happens to children who were not followed for the full time period? How was the population calculated in situations where children moved between regions mid-year?""

Response 2: Thank you for this prudent point. Our methods section could be improved with further granularity about our population and the data we analyzed.

This is a repeated monthly cross-sectional study meant to simulate a cohort study, but at a population level (as opposed to individual level). The children were included on a month-by-month basis. If any demographics changed (age, region), they would then be counted under that new category for the given month. The demographics were attached to the outcomes at the month level too. There were no minimum enrollment requirements and as a database study, the children were free to move, leave, and enter throughout the study period.

We have updated the manuscript to better describe our cohort in the first paragraph of the methods section.

Comment 3: ""The description and interpretation of rates of vaccination is wholly inadequate. What the denominator for monthly vaccination rates? It would be useful to also present the birth cohort rotavirus vaccination coverage at 12-23 months of age to allow for comparison with other data sources such as NIS. Finally, it would be interesting to look at timeliness of vaccination in this population as the upper age restrictions for rotavirus vaccine have been hypothesized to impact coverage, especially when compared with other routine infant vaccines.""

Response 3: We appreciate this constructive criticism and have worked to improve our discussion of the vaccination data.

The denominator is the number of individuals enrolled in a given month, which fluctuates each month throughout the study. The numerator each month was purely the number of rotavirus vaccinations that were administered to children <60 months of age and did not account for previous vaccinations, or rotavirus vaccination eligibility based on age.

We don't technically have a birth cohort as part of our study. While we agree that looking at a birth cohort would be interesting. Unfortunately, it would require a different study outside of what our team has accomplished as part of this manuscript.

Finally, as our study was a population level study that aggregated monthly vaccination and hospitalization rates, we did not track individual vaccinations nor their individual histories or the timing of their vaccines.

We clarified the population level of the study, clarified the vaccination counts, and specifically detailed that the denominator changed from month to month.

Comment 4: ""You used ICD 10 codes to determine rotavirus in the absence of testing, the sensitivity and specificity of which are not great (Pindyck T, Hall AJ, Tate JE, Cardemil CV, Kambhampati AK, Wikswo ME, Payne DC, Grytdal S, Boom JA, Englund JA, Klein EJ.

Response 4: This is a great point and similar data from the MHS has been previously reported. We updated the our discussion section to include a comparison of the data in an abstract and poster that was presented in 2023 at the Academy Health Annual Research Meeting in Seattle, Washington, USA. This is listed as citation #18 in the updated manuscript. Ultimately, the acute gastroenteritis data followed a similar trend with peaks and valleys reflective of the rotavirus data.

Comment 5: ""'Unique cases' is not defined in the methods.""

Response 5: Thank you for pointing this out and marks an important definition that we need to include. The manuscript has been updated and “Unique cases” is now defined in the second paragraph of the methods section.

Reviewer 2 Report

Comments and Suggestions for Authors

This manuscript presents an interesting analysis rates of rotavirus hospitalizations in military dependents <5 years of age before and during the COVID-19 pandemic and found that rotavirus hospitalization rates did not return to pre-pandemic levels until the third year after the start of the pandemic. The authors also looked at rates of rotavirus vaccination during the same periods but these data were harder to follow and interpret. Some specific comments are provided below.

Major Comments:

Please provide more information how vaccination status was determined. For children enrolled since birth, the CPT codes for rotavirus vaccination would have been captured by the MHS. However, for the 52.3% of children who entered the MHS at age of 6 months or older, how was the vaccination status determined? Is it possible to restrict the analysis to children who have been enrolled continuously since birth to ensure that all doses of rotavirus vaccine are captured?

What are the numerator and denominator for the monthly rotavirus vaccination rates per 10,000? Is this all children <5 years of age, children age-eligible to have received at least one of rotavirus vaccine, children >8 months of age (e.g. age-eligible to be fully vaccinated)? To fully see the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on rotavirus vaccination rates, it would be helpful to examine vaccination rates by birth cohort. Children who were born in January and February 2020 (and therefore reached 14 weeks 6 days during the early COVID-19 pandemic) would be expected to be most impacted by the pandemic.

Are the monthly rates of rotavirus vaccination calculated for children who received at least one dose or children who are fully vaccinated (defined based on which rotavirus vaccine received)?

The pre- and post-pandemic periods are defined using March 2020 as an anchor. This time point certainly makes sense especially when looking at vaccine coverage as there is no seasonality. However, when describing rotavirus hospitalization rates, it potentially splits rotavirus seasons into two different years (COVID-19 years 2 and 3 split the peak of the 2022 rotavirus season into separate years). In addition to the COVID-19-defined periods, consider also a secondary analysis comparing rotavirus seasons defined for July-June so that findings can be compared to previously published literature based on rotavirus seasons.

Minor Comments:

Abstract, Conclusions, page 1, line 28: The conclusions state that there was a decrease in rotavirus immunization rates. However, no data on immunization rates in the abstract. If this is a key finding, include immunization rates in the results section of the abstract.

Discussion, page 5, lines 142-144: Also, note that in addition to all doses being administered by 8 months of age, the rotavirus series must be initiated by 14 weeks 6 days.

Response 1: Thank you for taking the time to review and improve our manuscript. We appreciate your efforts in helping us ensure our manuscript clearly presents our findings to its future readers.

Response 2: Thank you for asking us to clarify this point as understanding how our vaccination data was derived is incredibly important to the study.

Vaccination status was never determined on an individual level, but rather was a population look at the number of times the CPT codes for rotavirus vaccination were used in children under 5 years of age who were enrolled in the MHS during each month of the study. Since the study was done with aggregated and population level data, using our current methods, we are unable to follow a birth cohort of patients, but we agree that this would be a useful way to look at the data.

The specifics of how the vaccination data was obtained has been clarified in the Methods section.

Comment 3: ""What are the numerator and denominator for the monthly rotavirus vaccination rates per 10,000?

Children who were born in January and February 2020 (and therefore reached 14 weeks 6 days during the early COVID-19 pandemic) would be expected to be most impacted by the pandemic.""

Response 3: We absolutely appreciate what the reviewer is asking as the counts and rates of the vaccination data is important to the context and interpretation of our study.

The numerator was every time a rotavirus vaccine CPT code was captured in a given month. The denominator was the number of children <60 months of age currently enrolled in the MHS. It did not take into account eligibility for the vaccine based on age or prior receipt of the rotavirus vaccination.

While we very much appreciate the reviewer’s point that looking at a birth cohort would be interesting and useful; unfortunately, it would require a study design that is different from what our team has accomplished as part of this manuscript.

Comment 4: ""Are the monthly rates of rotavirus vaccination calculated for children who received at least one dose or children who are fully vaccinated (defined based on which rotavirus vaccine received)?""

Response 4: Thank you for asking this important question, which was not clearly outlined in our methods section. The monthly rates were calculated based on the number of rotavirus vaccination CPT codes captured (numerator) over the total number of children <60 months of age enrolled in the MHS during that month (denominator).

We have updated the methods section to ensure our future readers understand how these numbers were calculated.

Comment 5: ""The pre- and post-pandemic periods are defined using March 2020 as an anchor. This time point certainly makes sense especially when looking at vaccine coverage as there is no seasonality. However, when describing rotavirus hospitalization rates, it potentially splits rotavirus seasons into two different years (COVID-19 years 2 and 3 split the peak of the 2022 rotavirus season into separate years). In addition to the COVID-19-defined periods, consider also a secondary analysis comparing rotavirus seasons defined for July-June so that findings can be compared to previously published literature based on rotavirus seasons.""

Response 5: Thanks for this important feedback! We want to make sure that our readers have a clear understanding of the pandemic timeline, and agree that the rotavirus seasonality is different than the COVID-19 time periods we utilized. In order to address this, we completed a sub-analysis using the July-June rotavirus season that would have overlapped with our COVID-19 time periods. We have included these updates in our Methods, Results, and Discussion. Ultimately, the rotavirus seasons also saw a significant decline in hospitalization rates, similar to our COVID-19 time periods, although the final rotavirus season did not return to the pre-pandemic rotavirus baseline (adjusted RR 0.71; 95% CI: 0.50, 0.99). Since the data was similar to the results using the pandemic years, we opted to discuss it in the text of the manuscript without adding it to our tables or figures.

Comment 6: ""Abstract, Conclusions, page 1, line 28: The conclusions state that there was a decrease in rotavirus immunization rates. However, no data on immunization rates in the abstract. If this is a key finding, include immunization rates in the results section of the abstract.""

Response 6: Thanks for catching this oversight as the immunization rates are an important aspect of our study. This has been updated in the results section of the abstract.

Comment 7: ""Discussion, page 5, lines 142-144: Also, note that in addition to all doses being administered by 8 months of age, the rotavirus series must be initiated by 14 weeks 6 days.""

Response 7: The reviewer points out a very important point that the rotavirus vaccine series is time bound both by the age at which it is initiated and that it is completed. This has been updated in the discussion section.",,N,0.0,2025-05-02 05:56:21.690163

Abstract

:

Background/Objectives: Rotavirus gastroenteritis is a vaccine-preventable disease that leads to hospitalization in children less than 5 years of age. Immunizations to prevent rotavirus have greatly altered the epidemiology of significant diarrheal illness. It has been reported that routine immunization rates in children were impacted during the COVID-19 pandemic. Contrary to this fact, rates of many childhood illnesses also decreased. Methods: The Military Health System Data Repository (MDR) contains the health records of all military beneficiaries. We queried the MDR before and during the COVID-19 pandemic to assess for alterations in immunization rates and hospitalization rates and to assess for risk factors for significant (hospitalizations) rotavirus disease. Results: Our study included a cohort of 1.27 million children under the age of 5 years old. There were 186 unique cases of rotavirus-related hospitalizations over the 5-year study period. During COVID-19 Years 1 and 2, there was a decrease in rotavirus-related hospitalizations compared to the pre-pandemic period. During Year 3, there was a return to the pre-pandemic level of rotavirus hospitalization rates. Patients in the northern United States were less likely to be hospitalized from rotavirus when compared to those in the south. The patients at greatest risk were the youngest beneficiaries. Rotavirus vaccination rates declined in this age group during all three years of the pandemic. Conclusions: As the pandemic resulted in less frequent rotavirus immunizations in the Military Health System (MHS), there was not an increase in rotavirus-related hospitalizations above the pre-pandemic baseline.

1. Introduction

Rotavirus gastroenteritis, a vaccine-preventable disease, causes significant morbidity and mortality in children less than 5 years of age. Prior to the advent of the rotavirus vaccine in 2006, it was responsible for more than 500,000 worldwide pediatric deaths annually [1]. In 2016, ten years after the first licensed rotavirus vaccine, pediatric rotavirus infections were estimated to cause 128,500 deaths and 1.5 million hospitalizations on an annual basis, with the majority occurring in resource-limited settings such as sub-Saharan Africa [2]. In the United States (US), rotavirus was responsible for 55,000–70,000 hospitalizations annually before the introduction of the vaccine, at a rate of 16 per 10,000 children less than 5 years of age. However, after the vaccine, hospitalization rates were drastically reduced by 80%, with reported rates ranging between 0.96 and 4.0 per 10,000 person-years among US children less than 5 years of age from 2012 and 2015 [3,4].

COVID-19 resulted in many behavioral changes. As public health officials began looking to stop the spread of SARS-CoV-2, social distancing, restrictions to movement, masking, and improved personal hygiene were implemented. These are commonly referred to as non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPI). During this time period, acute gastrointestinal illness (AGI) infections and hospitalizations, including those caused by rotavirus, declined [5]. Studies have suggested that the institution of NPIs for SARS-CoV-2 also reduced fecal-oral transmission of viruses that cause AGIs [6,7,8].

From a public health perspective, a negative consequence of the COVID-19 pandemic was the reduction in rates of pediatric vaccinations globally, in the US civilian population, and within the Military Health System (MHS) [9,10,11]. This gap in routine immunizations, such as rotavirus, left many children vulnerable to serious vaccine-preventable illnesses. Children enrolled in the MHS are a cross-section of the US population that lives around the globe and offers a unique opportunity to study vaccine-preventable diseases. Our hypothesis was that changes in the rotavirus immunization rates would result in an increase in rotavirus hospitalizations as we emerged from 2012 to the COVID-19 pandemic.

2. Materials and Methods

A repeated monthly cross-sectional study was performed using population-level outpatient and inpatient data from the MHS Data Repository (MDR) to observe differences in rotavirus vaccination and hospitalization rates and risk factors for hospitalization before and during the COVID-19 pandemic. Data from March 2018 to February 2020 was considered pre-pandemic, while the following three years (through February 2023) were divided into COVID Year 1 (March 2020–February 2021), Year 2 (March 2021–February 2022), and Year 3 (March 2022–February 2023). Children included in the study were between 0 and 59 months of age. Patients’ data, their demographics, and the results were captured and aggregated on a month-by-month basis. If an individual patient’s demographics changed during the study period, they were counted under that new category for the given month. There were no minimum enrollment requirements, and as a database study, the children were free to move, leave, and enter throughout the study period.

We identified those who were hospitalized with rotavirus and those who had received rotavirus vaccines using International Classification of Diseases 10th revision (ICD-10) code A08.0. Rotaviral enteritis and Current Procedural Terminology (CPT) codes 90680 and 90681. Unique rotavirus cases were defined as individuals with a hospitalization associated with the rotavirus ICD-10 code. The demographics associated with each unique case are from the time of the earliest encounter for that outcome. We recorded the number of these participants who received rotavirus vaccines and those who were hospitalized for rotavirus during the study period. For the full study population, demographics were recorded at the age of the first encounter in the MHS, whereas demographics for the unique cases were recorded at the time of a rotavirus diagnosis (Table 1). This was necessary as the enrolled population changed on a monthly basis, and thus this approach allowed us to report the number of unique individuals in the study as opposed to using an average or a monthly percentage.

Monthly rates of vaccination and hospitalization were calculated by dividing each monthly total by the number of dependents meeting our study criteria each month. Specifically, vaccination rates were determined based on the total number of rotavirus vaccines administered each month to all children under 60 months of age enrolled in the MHS and did not exclude patients who had already received the rotavirus vaccination series or were outside of the vaccination age eligibility window. COVID-19 period rate ratios (RR) with 95% confidence intervals (CI) were calculated using unadjusted and adjusted Poisson regression controlling for several demographic variables, including sex, parent military rank, age, and region. Age was broken into 6 groups: 0–5 months old, 6–11 months old, 12–23 months old, 24–35 months old, 36–47 months old, and 48–59 months old. Both the hospitalization and vaccination data population enrollment fluctuate each month throughout the study as patients move in and out of the Military Health System. Parent military rank was also used to assess the socioeconomic status of our cohort. Multiple geographic regions—North, South, West, and Overseas—were assessed for significance based on the insurance regions used by TRICARE; the primary medical insurance company of the MHS. The TRICARE South region was used as the geographic control, as gastrointestinal illness rates tend to be less seasonal given the more temperate weather when compared to other regions.

In addition to the primary analysis performed using the COVID-19 time periods, we performed a sub-analysis utilizing the typical rotavirus seasons. These were performed from July 2018 through June 2022. Season 1 (July 2018–June 2019) was used as a pre-pandemic comparator, while the following three rotavirus seasons (Season 2: July 2019–June 2020; Season 3: July 2020–June 2021; and Season 4: July 2021–June 2022) were representative of the expected rotavirus seasons after the start of the pandemic.

We conducted this study with the approval of the Uniformed Services University of the Health Sciences Institutional Review Board (USUHS:2020-065—2 October 2021) in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki. Additionally, waivers of informed consent and HIPAA were approved as the study dealt with pre-existing de-identified medical records from the MDR.

3. Results

Rotavirus Hospitalizations

Our study included a cohort of 1.27 million MHS beneficiaries under the age of 5 years. Among this group, there were 186 unique cases of rotavirus infections in hospitalized children less than 5 years old when combining pre- and post-pandemic data (Table 1). A total of 100 infections requiring hospitalization occurred in males, and 86 occurred in females. During both Years 1 and 2 of the COVID-19 pandemic, there was a significant decrease in rotavirus-related hospitalizations compared to the pre-pandemic period, with an adjusted RR of 0.18 (95% CI: 0.10, 0.34) in Year 1 and an adjusted RR of 0.41 (95% CI: 0.26, 0.65) in Year 2. During Year 3 after the start of the COVID-19 pandemic, there was a return to the pre-pandemic level of rotavirus hospitalization rates with an adjusted RR of 0.84 (95% CI: 0.59, 1.19). In the sub-analysis using typical rotavirus seasons, there was a statistically significant decrease in rotavirus-related hospitalizations during the post-pandemic rotavirus seasons (Seasons 2, 3, and 4) when compared to the pre-pandemic rotavirus season (Season 1). The adjusted RRs were 0.22 (95% CI: 0.13, 0.36) for Season 2, 0.11 (0.06, 0.22) for Season 3, and 0.71 (0.5, 0.99) for Season 4.

Patients who were enrolled in the TRICARE North region of the United States were statistically less likely to be hospitalized for rotavirus when compared to those enrolled in TRICARE South, with an adjusted RR of 0.56 (95% CI: 0.37, 0.86) (Table 2). Younger age was associated with an increased risk of hospitalization, which was most evident in the youngest age bracket of 0–5 months old and persisted through 35 months of age (Figure 1). Patient sex and parent military rank were not statistically significant. A return to the previously demonstrated seasonality of rotavirus-related hospitalizations with peaks in the late winter was observed (Figure 2).

When compared to pre-pandemic vaccination rates, there was a 12–14% decline in rotavirus vaccine administration in the MHS for COVID-19 Years 1–3 with an RR of 0.86–0.88 (95% CI: 0.86, 0.89). Our study demonstrates that after the pandemic was declared in March 2020, there was a notable decrease in rotavirus vaccines in the cohort, especially during the first 1.5 years, with marginal recovery into the third year of the pandemic (Figure 3).

4. Discussion

Despite the decrease in delivery of rotavirus immunizations during Years 1–3 of the COVID-19 pandemic, there was not a rise in serious rotavirus infections leading to hospitalization during Years 1 and 2, but during Year 3, there was a return to pre-pandemic levels. The sub-analysis using typical rotavirus seasons showed a similar decrease in hospitalization rates during Seasons 2 and 3, with a rise in Season 4; however, rates did not return to the pre-pandemic seasonal rotavirus baseline. There were statistically significant decreases in rotavirus vaccination rates in Year 1, 2, and even Year 3 of the COVID-19 pandemic. There was also a decrease in rotavirus hospitalization rates during Years 1 and 2, with a return to the pre-pandemic baseline hospitalization rates in Year 3. The decrease in vaccination rates is consistent with a general decline in US vaccine administration since the start of the pandemic [12]. It is possible that early in the pandemic (Years 1–2), the decrease in vaccination rates was related to a decline in in-person routine well visits, leading to subsequently missed vaccines [13].

Over the course of the pandemic, vaccine hesitancy increased not just for SARS-CoV-2 vaccines, but for all vaccines [14]. This pronounced hesitancy may have also contributed to persistently lower vaccine administration later in the pandemic (Years 2–3), even when most Americans were no longer utilizing strict NPIs. Additionally, in terms of rotavirus vaccination, there is a narrow vaccine administration window, as it must be initiated by 14 weeks and 6 days of life and completed before the infant is older than 8 months, with no available catch-up options after that time. In regard to hospitalization rates, it is possible that the broad application of NPIs led to the significant decrease in hospitalizations in Years 1 and 2. In Year 3, the return to pre-pandemic rotavirus-related hospitalization rates in our cohort is unsurprising given the relaxation of NPIs across the globe, children returning to daycare and school, and declining rates of rotavirus vaccination without catch-up opportunities.

Prior to the pandemic in the US, rotavirus had a typical seasonality, with peaks of hospitalizations and infections occurring during the winter months, which disappeared during the first few years of COVID-19 [15]. A return to the previously demonstrated seasonality of rotavirus-related hospitalizations with peaks in the late winter was observed in this study. Another plausible explanation is the biennial (every 2 years) pattern of rotavirus infections that emerged in the United States after the introduction of the rotavirus vaccine [5]. This phenomenon by itself could explain the re-emergence of rotavirus back to pre-pandemic baseline levels, but further surveillance would be necessary to see if the biennial pattern will return in the post-COVID era.

Consistent with this study’s results, the rates of rotavirus gastroenteritis have staged a slower global return to baseline when compared to other respiratory infections and invasive bacterial infections. Prior to the COVID-19 pandemic, rotavirus was the leading gastrointestinal infection responsible for hospitalization and death in pediatric patients [2]. Since the start of the pandemic in March 2020, many countries, including China, Finland, Brazil, Germany, and the United States, have reported significantly fewer rotavirus infections even after they started to reduce pandemic-related NPIs in the latter stages [5,6,7,16,17]. An MHS-affiliated research team also presented MDR data during a similar pandemic time frame (January 2018 through April 2022) using acute gastroenteritis ICD-10 codes for 0–17-year-old individuals. The data demonstrated a similar rise and fall of gastroenteritis inpatient admissions, with a peak in March 2019 and again in March 2022, with a decline in hospitalization rates from January 2020 until January 2021, which was briefer when compared to the rotavirus data in this study [18]. The decrease in rotavirus infections has occurred in contrast to the return of common respiratory viral infections during the same general time period. Common respiratory viruses were far less common during the height of pandemic NPIs, and there was an associated reduction of many invasive bacterial infections in children that often occur after common respiratory infections [19,20]. Similar to rotavirus infections, invasive bacterial infections from bacteria such as Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, and Neisseria meningitidis have resurfaced in children during the same time as the global relaxation of NPIs [21,22,23,24].

Our study reflects the overall decrease in rotavirus immunization rates across the US. Alarmingly, each year of the pandemic was highlighted by a statistically significant decrease in immunizations relative to the years prior to the onset of COVID-19. Before the pandemic, rotavirus vaccines were estimated to prevent 525,000 hospitalizations around the globe annually. One analysis from 2019 demonstrated that rotavirus vaccines could prevent up to 750,000 hospitalizations annually if further efforts to increase worldwide vaccination rates were undertaken [25]. Specific to our population, children enrolled in the MHS have significantly benefited from rotavirus vaccines, as the hospitalization rate amongst this cohort dropped from 14.37 per 10,000 person-years in 2005–2006 to 5.47 per 10,000 person-years in 2008–2009 [26]. In the US, a study using a theoretical model predicted that incremental improvements in rotavirus vaccine coverage could continue to avert the number of severe cases of rotavirus infections by up to 57% [27]. The US, which recommends rotavirus vaccination as part of its childhood immunization schedule, has historically had lower rotavirus coverage rates compared to other childhood vaccines [28]. For example, in 2016 the rotavirus vaccination rate in the US was 74.1%; however, vaccine administration rates for childhood immunizations given at the same well visits, such as diphtheria, tetanus, and pertussis (DTaP), poliovirus, hepatitis B, Haemophilus influenzae type b, and Streptococcus pneumoniae vaccines, were higher at 83.4–93.7%, 91.9%, 90.5%, 81.8–92.8%, and 81.8–91.8%, respectively [28]. Despite the comparatively lower rotavirus vaccine administration rate, overall hospitalization rates still remained low, ranging between 0.96 and 4.0 per 10,000 person-years among US children less than 5 years of age from 2012 to 2015 [3]. Addressing and closing the gap in all routine childhood immunizations, including rotavirus, will be an important area of focus for medical providers moving forward in order to help keep hospitalization rates from rising above pre-pandemic levels.

We have speculated on reasons for the return to pre-pandemic hospitalization rates, including reduction in NPIs, return to daycare and school, and the loss of community-wide vaccine-derived immunity. All of these certainly increase the risk of a return to pre-rotavirus vaccine hospitalization rates. Based on our results, the risk of severe infection leading to hospitalization remains elevated through 35 months of age. This is consistent with global reports that demonstrate rotavirus as the leading cause of mortality from diarrhea in children under 5 years of age [29]. The risk of severe infection could potentially be exacerbated by missed rotavirus immunizations, which must be started by 15 weeks of age and completed before 8 months of age. Outside of this time frame, rotavirus is not recommended to be a part of a catch-up immunization schedule. This is a new and looming threat that will require continued research to determine if hospitalization rates increase above pre-pandemic levels or result in a shift in the age of patients with severe disease. However, if missed vaccinations create a cohort of older children susceptible to rotavirus disease, this may be ameliorated as older children are less susceptible than young infants to severe disease requiring hospitalization.

Despite the proposed reasons for an increase in rotavirus-related hospitalizations, our study did not see the increase until year 3, and it did not rise above the pre-pandemic levels. A potential explanation as to why the increase was not worse is herd immunity. One study in the US, which evaluated over 9,000 rotavirus gastroenteritis infections, found a substantial indirect vaccine efficacy in unimmunized persons ranging from 35% in 45–64-year-old individuals and up to 79% in children under 1 year of age [30]. Another global study looking at 112 countries found more modest indirect impacts of rotavirus immunization, with vaccine efficacy no higher than 26.7% in the unimmunized [31]. With these studies in mind, infants who were immunized potentially provided adequate protection to their close contacts who were not vaccinated and therefore did not increase hospitalization rates above the baseline in our cohort. It is also reasonable to consider that at the beginning of the pandemic, patients were more conscious of contagious diseases and regularly practiced appropriate NPIs, but those behaviors waned over time [32].

It must be highlighted that the beneficiaries included in the study are from a global population. Thus, NPIs that impacted this cohort were asynchronous and variable. Many factors impacted the modification of NPIs. These include mandates to return to work and school, the acquisition of community-wide immunity through either immunization or infection, and societal factors that limited the continued acceptance of these practices. For example, Year 1 of the pandemic led to significant lockdowns and closures within the US. The second year featured more in-person work and school as the population began to become immunized. In the third year to present, lifestyles returned to pre-pandemic forms. Thus, there was an expected resumption of transmission of pathogens by the fecal-oral route, leading to a return of rotavirus.

The primary strength of this study is the large cohort of over 1 million pediatric patients enrolled in the MHS, including their ICD-10 codes obtained from civilian institutions and military treatment facilities. The MHS pediatric population predominantly lives in the continental United States, but a small proportion of the population lives globally. Interestingly, there was a statistically significant reduction in hospitalization rates in patients enrolled in TRICARE North when compared to TRICARE South. While this study is observational and not designed to address the cause of regional differences, we postulate that the regional variations regarding social distancing and non-pharmacologic interventions such as masking, handwashing, and social distancing likely played a role. Certainly, climate can also impact regional variations in rotavirus rates, as warmer climates are known to have a more constant circulation of rotavirus. Limitations of this study include a reliance on ICD-10 codes, unknown changes in rotavirus testing practices before and after the pandemic, the inability to directly correlate rotavirus testing and ICD-10 codes for the entire cohort, and unknown immunization status of hospitalized patients. Additionally, despite our large cohort, there were relatively few cases to analyze, which may limit the study’s conclusions.

5. Conclusions

Despite the reduction in routine rotavirus immunization administration to children in the MHS after the COVID-19 pandemic started, there was no increase in rotavirus-related hospitalizations above the pre-pandemic baseline. In the first two years following the start of the pandemic, there was a statistically significant decrease in hospitalizations related to rotavirus in our cohort, followed by a return to baseline in the third year. These shifts were temporally associated with the initiation of public health strategies meant to reduce the spread of SARS-CoV-2. Social distancing, to include daycare closures, increased hygiene measures, and catch-up immunizations, may explain this finding. Lastly, missed vaccinations during the narrow rotavirus vaccination window may leave many children at risk for severe rotavirus infections during early childhood. Appropriate and timely childhood immunizations are paramount to protecting young children from rotavirus. Continued surveillance is warranted to determine if hospitalization rates return to pre-pandemic levels or result in a shift in the age of patients with severe disease.

It provides an opportunity to reflect on what we’ve accomplished—and where we must do more—to ensure our service members, families, and civilian workforce receive the mental health support they need and deserve.

At the Department of Defense, we are building a culture where seeking mental health care is not only accepted—it’s fully supported. From policy change and digital modernization to prevention programs and peer leadership, the Military Health System is transforming how we identify, support, and treat mental health needs across the force.

One of the most impactful legislative reforms in recent years is the Brandon Act, named in memory of U.S. Navy Petty Officer 3rd Class Brandon Caserta. His death by suicide underscored the need for a confidential, stigma-free process for service members to request mental health support.

The department implemented the Brandon Act in May 2023. In 2025, every service member–regardless of rank or component–can self-initiate a mental health referral confidentially, without command interference or delay. Education campaigns and policy updates across the services have reinforced this right. It is now embedded in unit-level practice and care pathways.

This act empowers our people. It saves lives. And it honors Brandon’s legacy.

Commitment to mental health requires robust access to care, but to truly achieve culture change requires empowering leaders and peers to engage people where they’re most comfortable in their healthcare experience. That’s why the department launched the BRAVE program (Behavioral Health Resources and Virtual Experience) in 2022. BRAVE began with 16 military hospitals and clinics and has since expanded to 43 facilities, with plans to add more. This growth reflects our commitment to integrating virtual mental health services across the MHS, enhancing support for service members and their families.

We also know that mental health and brain health are deeply intertwined. The Warfighter Brain Health Initiative is leading a holistic transformation across DOD, focusing on traumatic brain injury prevention, cognitive performance, sleep optimization, and neurocognitive surveillance.

In FY24, the department began performing baseline cognitive assessments at accessions and piloting new neurobehavioral tools for use in high-risk occupations. In 2024, more than 200,000 service members completed cognitive assessments. Additionally, at Fort Bragg, sleep interventions tied to cognitive performance tracking are helping reduce fatigue-related injuries and improve mission focus.

By investing in lifelong brain health, we are building a smarter, safer, and more adaptable force.

We continue to expand the Embedded Mental Health model, which brings licensed mental health professionals into operational units. Across the MHS, EMH teams have reduced wait times, improved trust in care, and increased early intervention referrals. EMH ensures that mental health is not something a service member has to go out and find–it’s already in the room!

The department has also modernized mental healthcare delivery through the Behavioral Health Data Portal, now integrated with MHS GENESIS. Clinicians across DOD can use standardized assessments to measure symptom improvement, track treatment progress, and tailor interventions in real time.

This data-driven approach ensures we are not only delivering care—we’re delivering the right care, at the right time, with measurable results.

Our most valuable resource is our people. Every life lost to suicide is a tragedy. DOD is taking an evidence-based, multi-level approach to prevention. For example, at Naval Base San Diego, commanders piloting unit-based suicide prevention check-ins reported improved trust and earlier detection of distress. Recognizing the need for a solution within the U.S. Air Force, the 59th Medical Wing collaborated with operational units to implement the Military Aviator Peer Support program. Modeled after commercial aviation peer support systems, MAPS provides aviators with a confidential, nonmedical support network, in an effort to shift military aviation culture toward one that embraces mental wellness as a component of mission readiness.

This is not just a health issue–it’s a readiness issue, and a leadership responsibility.

We are also reinforcing our message through campaigns like Real Warriors, sharing authentic stories of recovery and strength, and through organizations like the Psychological Health Center of Excellence, ensuring every program we initiate is grounded in evidence and driven by impact.

As the Acting Assistant Secretary of Defense for Health Affairs, I remain committed to making mental health care accessible, culturally competent, personalized, and proactively integrated into performance, safety, and retention planning.

This Mental Health Awareness Month, we celebrate the progress we’ve made–and recommit to the work ahead. Every service member should know help is available, hope is real, and your mental health matters!

Together, we are building a military where strength includes seeking support–and where no one fights alone!",https://dha.mil/-/media/Project/Images/News-Images/35728.png,N,1.0,2025-05-02 12:56:22.150529

We continue to expect revenue for the full year 2025 to be in the range of $250,000,000 to $260,000,000 As a reminder, this revenue guidance excludes the more than $25,000,000 that we would have expected from APC in 2025.
We expect our 2025 adjusted EBITDA to be in the range of negative 50 5 million to negative $45,000,000 which demonstrates a 60% improvement year over year.
So in q three, we anticipate a one time step up in DHA software revenue normalizing slightly below the Q3 level into Q4, with total software revenue ending the year at approximately 60% of total revenue.
We continue to anticipate that Amwell will end 2025 with approximately $190,000,000 in cash, and in excess of $150,000,000 in cash at year end 2026.","Amwell Corp (AMWL) reported a 12% year-over-year increase in total revenue to $66.8 million for Q1 2025, with subscription software revenue growing by 30% to $32.2 million.

The company also noted a significant improvement in adjusted EBITDA, narrowing losses to -$12.2 million from -$45.6 million in Q1 2024. According to InvestingPro analysis, the stock currently appears undervalued compared to its Fair Value, though investors should note the company’s rapid cash burn rate.

Full transcript - American Well Corp (AMWL) Q1 2025:

Conference Operator: Good day, and thank you for standing by. Welcome to the AmWell First Quarter twenty twenty five Earnings Conference Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen only mode. After the speakers’ presentation, there will be a question and answer session. Please be advised that today’s conference is being recorded.

I would now like to hand the conference over to your speaker today, Sue Dewey, Head of Investor Relations for Amwell. Please go ahead.

Sue Dewey, Head of Investor Relations, Amwell: Hello, everyone. Welcome to Amwell’s conference call to discuss our first fiscal quarter of twenty twenty five. This is Sue Dooley of Amwell Investor Relations. Joining me today are Amwell’s Chairman and CEO, Doctor. Ito Schoenberg and Mark Kirshorn, our CFO and Chief Operating Officer.

Earlier today, we distributed a press release detailing our announcement. Our earnings report is posted on our website at investors.amwell.com and is also available through normal news sources. This conference call is being webcast live on the IR page of our website where a replay will be archived. Before we begin our prepared remarks, I’d like to take this opportunity to remind you that during the call, we’ll make forward looking statements regarding projected operating results and anticipated market opportunities. This forward looking information is subject to the risks and uncertainties described in our filings with the SEC.

Actual results or events may differ materially. Except as required by law, we undertake no obligation to update or revise these forward looking statements. On the call, we’ll refer to both GAAP and non GAAP financial measures. A reconciliation of GAAP to non GAAP financial measures is provided in our posted earnings release. With that, I would like to turn the call over to Ito.

Ito Schoenberg, Chairman and CEO, Amwell: Thank you, Sue, and good evening, everyone. I’m pleased to report that Q1 was an impactful quarter for our company, one that provided a strong start to an important year for us. As a reminder, on our last call, we shared our guidance for a big mix shift in software revenue in 2025 that will help us achieve our positive cash flow from operations goal in 2026. We execute on with a strong sense of purpose. In a dynamic time for our industry, our goals remain steady and our mission to transform healthcare remains as relevant as ever.

Our solution is built to deliver on goals that are universal and timeless, enabling our clients to leverage technology enabled care for efficiency and to improve outcomes with better access to more affordable, convenient and effective care. To begin tonight’s call, I’d like to provide you with some more detail on our performance in Q1, before discussing what we are seeing in the markets. Then Marc will review our financial results and our outlook for the second quarter of the year. First, together with our latest partners, we advanced our progress in the stage launch of our full solution across the military health system. We are inspired by the alignment of our mission with that of the LPDH, as we collaborate to achieve important and enduring goals for members of the military and their families.

With efficiency defining the urgent agenda of the present day, we see a natural fit for our value proposition. We are hopeful this partnership positions us to be a major contributor in the federal market landscape for many years. Second, we made significant progress in our path to achieving positive cash flow from operations in 2026. These initiatives are showing up in a steady, better than expected quarterly improvements in our adjusted EBITDA, and this is the case again also in Q1. We are driving for efficiency, with ongoing focused cost reduction measures, while improving our quality of revenue and profit margins.

We have successfully increased our mix of subscription software revenues and aligned our costs. We are targeting meaningful margin expansion this year, and with another strong EBITDA performance this quarter, we take a step closer to our goal to improve our adjusted EBITDA by over 60% this year, as compared to 2024. In other news, Dan Zemanski joined Zamwell this quarter as our Chief Product and Technology Officer. Dan comes to us from Amazon Healthcare. His proven track record, leading global and cross functional teams responsible for platform services, artificial intelligence, and product management gives him the right mix of experience to drive synergies and support our path to profitable growth.

Dan is already an excellent addition to our leadership team, as we continue to sharpen our operational focus on key priorities, driving efficiencies, optimizing cash flow, and fueling growth. Continuing with the Q1 highlights, here are some more details on our performance. Our teams are working well with our Leidos partners. As of early April, the entire global military health system enterprise is now using our platform for virtual visits. This milestone puts us in a very strong strategic position as we continue to grow our programs.

Patient and provider satisfaction on our platform is reported as very high, at well over 90%. As we continue this important work of implementation, many of our programs are now fully deployed and extending their reach across the military health systems around the globe. Regarding this initiative, I would like to spend a moment updating you on deployment timing of our automated and digital behavioral health programs. With our solution now live across the entire military health system for scheduled visits, our dedicated teams are completing the work that precedes the go lives in the remaining territories for these programs. We are on time and on budget with deliverables for this initiative.

However, as a result of the top leadership transition at the DHA, we and our latest partners were asked to wait for the final confirmation from the new DHA director before completing these last mile deployments. Reflecting this, we now expect that these remaining lives will happen in Q3 rather than Q2. In our conversation with the DHA and Leidos leadership, both remain confident in the DHA’s unwavering commitment to providing the high quality care associated with the Digital First initiative. Importantly, our expectations are unchanged regarding the renewal of our contract with Leidos and the DHA, as indicated in the October 2024 intent to award that specifically names Amwell. Moving on to some highlights from our commercial growth organization.

We had a healthy quarter of building pipeline, and we drove important client renewals across payer and provider clients. These included Penn State Hershey, the University of Chicago, and Corel Health. Corel continues to document measurable success with our automated emergency room discharge program. On the heels of a big expansion in Q4, we also had a sizable renewal with the HSC in Ireland, which continues to improve access to care through its growing use of digital behavioral health programs. On the heels of good progress in Q1, we continue into the year with momentum and focus, with market dynamics working in our favor.

I would like to speak to these trends for a brief moment. Increasingly, we believe that the fractional care that people get in their day to day lives is going to shift dramatically from brick and mortar into technology enabled care. Consumers are showing greater appetite to seek care online, and the inventory of technology enabled care clinical programs is quickly expanding. While this change brings incredible opportunities, it also creates new complexities to solve for. First, payers and health systems struggle to make sure that consumer engagement is efficient, that care experience is streamlined, and the demand is matched with the right services.

Services need to be covered, appropriate, and have demonstrated improved clinical and financial outcomes. Second, clinical program vendors are challenged with high customer acquisition costs, and they need to integrate their offering with whole person and even whole population care. It is becoming harder and harder for them to independently show a viable business model offering a program around a single therapeutic area. That is exactly where Amul platform comes in. With our single, unified platform for technology enabled care, we believe we have cemented our role as the enabler of this movement.

Here’s how. First, we help payers and health systems offer a single unified member and patient experience that is attributed to their own trusted brand and features older sponsored care programs. With a unified platform, payers and providers can offer exceptional consumer experience, helping individuals receive the most appropriate care in the simplest and most reliable way. Leveraging our technology helps our clients optimize customer engagement costs and improve clinical and financial outcomes, making quality care more affordable and accessible to all. We also make it easier for clients to document, analyze, and report whole person outcomes across the full patient and member cohort and sub cohorts.

On our platform, payers and providers remain agile and flexible in offering the most effective programs at any given time. And our platform makes them future ready, so that as new, innovative, and AI driven solutions become available, we make it simple to switch programs while maintaining a consistent experience. Second, we offer our own comprehensive array of out of the box native and integrated AMOL clinical programs. These programs cover a big part of the care continuum, including urgent care, virtual primary care, behavioral health, and growing number of specialty care programs. With appropriate safeguards, we embed artificial intelligence, advanced automation, and other technologies to power exceptional user experience and better outcomes.

The ecosystem of high quality Amwell programs make us a simpler choice for our clients, especially in comparison to point solution players. And finally, we help third party clinical program innovators improve their market reach and stickiness by integrating their solution into our platform. Importantly, this provides a high quality revenue source for Amwell as we grow together. The value of our platform approach to technology enabled care is meaningful to all players, and we believe our large customer footprint, deep integrations, and vast deployments form a long term bond with health organizations that make up a big part of The US ecosystem. In terms of market penetration, our client reach is significant, and we believe we are just getting started.

For almost two decades, we have proudly served some of the largest and most sophisticated healthcare organizations in The U. S. Yet, according to McKinsey and others, only a handful of percent points of care is done online today. We think this is beginning to change in a very significant way, and our unified platform sits at the heart of a growing theme that embraces technology to drive outcomes and efficiency. We believe we are exceptionally well positioned to take advantage of these market forces.

We see this reflected in our conversations out in the market, in our growing pipeline for new business, and across our own clients, we were targeting an attractive opportunity for expansion growth. With that, I would like to turn the call over to Mark to review our financials and our guidance. Mark?

Mark Kirshorn, CFO and Chief Operating Officer, Amwell: Thank you, Ito, and good afternoon to everyone on the call. Tonight, I will walk you through a few operating metrics and financial results from the first quarter and then review our guidance. The financial highlights of our first quarter include progress toward our key strategic initiatives. Software revenue grew over 30% from Q1 of last year, as we drove strategic client deployments, including the enterprise go live of scheduled virtual visits across the global military health system, the most significant growth initiative in our company’s history. Also, we accelerated our adjusted EBITDA improvements for the fourth quarter in a row, as we continue to focus on increasing our software mix and aligning our cost structure with our revenue base.

Most importantly, as Ito highlighted, we have demonstrated continued progress with our most strategic objectives, specifically the staged launch of our full solution across the military health system and the cost initiatives that reinforce our confidence in our path to generating positive cash flows from operations during 2026. We have committed ourselves to executing these initiatives that will ultimately drive value to our company. So now let me share some of our Q1 financial results. Total revenue was $66,800,000 for the quarter, which is 12% higher than Q1 of twenty twenty four. Normalizing to the sale of Amwell Psychiatric Care, first quarter revenue was 25% higher than Q1 twenty twenty four.

Revenue mix here is more important metric as subscription software revenue was 48% of total revenue at $32,200,000 in Q1, up 30% from a year ago and compared to $37,000,000 in Q4. You will remember that in Q4, our software revenue benefited from a material uplift in subscription software revenue related to deploying our solution across the military health system. Turning to visit metrics, we completed approximately 1,300,000 visits in the first quarter, which is approximately 23% lower than a year ago. Normalizing for APC, this was 21% lower than last year. Visits in the first quarter were in line with our adjusted expectations for the quarter.

AMG’s first quarter visit revenue trended 14.3% lower than last year at $26,600,000 Normalizing for APC, however, visits were higher by 6.6% than a year ago. Average revenue per visit was $71 which is 8% lower this quarter compared to last year’s Q1, but revenue per visit was 8% higher than last year after normalizing for APC. This increase was driven by a mix shift within AMG visits towards virtual primary care and specialty programs. Our AMG business continues to be foundational to our overall business. It is highly visible to us and is strategically important to enabling client expansions and new client wins, and for the overall support of our efforts to grow recurring software revenues.

Our services and CarePoint revenue was $8,000,000 for the quarter versus $4,900,000 last quarter. The nature of our business drives variable revenues due to consumer buying patterns for marketing programs and for care points, as well as the timing of professional service milestones that precede deployments. Turning now to gross profit, which continues to improve. Our quarter one gross margin was 52.8%, higher by 4.3 percentage points compared to Q4, reflecting higher software mix and cost initiatives. Onto operating expenses, our consistent efforts in reducing and aligning our costs are showing results down the line.

We continue to make substantial progress towards normalizing R and D spending, While maintaining our focus on deploying our solution for the DHA, our r and d expenses in q1 were $22,100,000 This represents a decline of approximately 17% compared to the $26,700,000 we spent in q1 of twenty twenty four. Sales and marketing expenses were $12,600,000 This is approximately 18% lower than last quarter, and nearly 51% lower than last year’s comparable quarter. And g and a expenses were $23,200,000 approximately 33% lower than last quarter, and nearly 29% lower than last year’s comparable quarter. G and A remains a meaningful focus of our ongoing cost initiatives. So we’ve now completed another consecutive quarter that underscores our key strategic initiatives.

We are delivering on the promise of growing our subscription software revenue, while being well on our way to reshaping basis. As a result, adjusted EBITDA for the quarter was negative $12,200,000 versus negative $45,600,000 in Q1 twenty twenty four. Finally, with respect to cash and liquidity, we ended the first quarter with $222,000,000 in cash and marketable securities with zero debt. And now I would like to turn to our guidance for 2025. This year, the high margin revenue growth we are guiding for is underscored by our focus on expanding our mix of subscription software revenues, taking conservative view on visit volumes, while further reducing costs.

With this in mind, we are reiterating our annual revenue and adjusted EBITDA guidance for 2025. We continue to expect revenue for the full year 2025 to be in the range of $250,000,000 to $260,000,000 As a reminder, this revenue guidance excludes the more than $25,000,000 that we would have expected from APC in 2025. Importantly, with the most strategic elements of our revenue base intact, we anticipate subscription revenue to meaningfully grow to represent nearly 60% of total 2025 revenues. Our range for AMG visits is between one point three million and one point three five million visits. We expect our 2025 adjusted EBITDA to be in the range of negative 50 5 million to negative $45,000,000 which demonstrates a 60% improvement year over year.

Here’s some additional context around our assumptions. We are on track to further reduce our R and D expense by more than 10% this year versus 2024. As we streamline and complete the bulk of our software configuration work for our existing commitments. Overall, we expect sales and marketing costs to decline over 25% year over year. We expect to reduce our G and A expense beyond 20% for the year as we continue to organize the company around the new lower cost structure.

And I would like to repeat Ito’s comment that our expectations are unchanged regarding the renewal of our contract with Leidos for the DHA as indicated in the October 2024 intent to award that specifically names Amwell. Next, our guidance for Q2. We expect revenue for the second quarter of twenty twenty five to be in the range of $62,000,000 to $67,000,000 As to adjusted EBITDA, we expect our Q2 adjusted EBITDA to be in the range of negative 12 to negative 10,000,000 There are some additional revenue timing related dynamics we want to call to your attention. Ito previously mentioned that as a result of the top leadership transition at the DHA, we and our Leidos partners were asked to wait for final confirmation from the new DHA director before completing these last deployments. Reflecting this, we now expect that the remaining enterprise go lives of our automated and digital behavioral health programs will happen in q three rather than in q two.

So in q three, we anticipate a one time step up in DHA software revenue normalizing slightly below the Q3 level into Q4, with total software revenue ending the year at approximately 60% of total revenue. Wrapping up, we are encouraged by the strides we have made in our business. And in the first quarter, we made solid progress toward the goals which support our confidence in our path to generating positive cash flows from operations during 2026. We continue to anticipate that Amwell will end 2025 with approximately $190,000,000 in cash, and in excess of $150,000,000 in cash at year end 2026. There’s great energetic team here at Amwell that is fully aligned with delivering the novel health care products, services, and efficiencies that we successfully deliver to our clients every single day.

Thank you for participating this afternoon. And with that, I’d like to turn the call back to Ito for some closing remarks. Ito?

Ito Schoenberg, Chairman and CEO, Amwell: Thank you, Mark. Before we take your questions, I’d like to briefly wrap up. We ended Q2 with a strong sense of purpose and unprecedented focus on our key operational initiatives for the year, which center on unlocking value in our company and pursuing our mission. To summarize: we are delivering, with our latest partners, the promise of the Military Health System Digital First initiative, a model for modernizing healthcare and the value of technology enabled care. We have focused our strategy to fuel higher quality revenue mix and to achieve the promise of our vision.

As we bring our unique, differentiated solution into a very large yet underpenetrated market opportunity, we are set to achieve our goal of positive cash flow from operations during 2026, as well as for long term profitable growth for many years to come. With that, I would like to open the call to questions. Operator, please go ahead. Thank you.

Conference Operator: Thank you. Our first question comes from the line of Craig Hettenbach with Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open.

Craig Hettenbach, Analyst, Morgan Stanley: Great. Thank you. Just outside of the DHA, can you talk about just bookings trends for CONVERGE more broadly? And then also just with the hire of Dan from Amazon, perhaps some things he can leverage from his experience or key strategic priorities as he gets on board there.

Unnamed Speaker, Company Representative, Amwell: Absolutely. Great. It’s good to hear your voice and thank you for the question. In general, we see very good receptivity to the AMOLED platform in its new format in the market well beyond the DHA. Overall, there is growing understanding and agreement that more and more people are going to go online, and they would need a singular experience to match them with growing number of clinical programs and the data infrastructure to report to those programs.

Of course, we deployed it in very large scale in some of the largest organizations, including DHA, Elephants and others, but we also deployed it in smaller scale opportunities generating very similar value, all to mid size and even smaller customers. All that results with a product that is much more focused, proven and scalable is not lost on people as they think about creating a technology level care infrastructure for years to come. A lot of the activities happening as we speak and it will be more apparent to more people as we move forward. As to Dan joining, Dan was a very well known leader in Amazon. He founded HealthAI in AWS and then led the platforms for Amazon.

He brings a very broad network of expertise and capabilities, including a high proficiency in AI. With him and other talent in the company and some new relationship inside and outside the company, we are transforming the offering with some new technologies. The key focus areas for DAN in world of product includes streamlining the consumer experience, improving the way we match people with growing number of clinical programs and the data, the bidirectional data we exchange in order to further optimize their results. And finally, the data infrastructure to create a sophisticated analytics that help our sponsors understand the value that is generated by those programs. We then, Mark, and other new leaders in the company.

I know we have what we need in order to very efficiently realize the mission of the AMOLED platform and grow successfully going forward in the market.

Craig Hettenbach, Analyst, Morgan Stanley: Got it. Thanks for all that.

Conference Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Charles Rhyee with TD Cowen. Your line is now open.

Charles Rhyee, Analyst, TD Cowen: Yes, thanks for taking the questions. Hey, just a couple of quick questions around sort of the results here. And really as we think about the guidance, obviously great performance in the quarter, particularly in terms of margins and managing the EBITDA loss here. Is this sort of the right gross margin rate? Because I think you had guided sort of north of 50%, obviously, did more like 53% here in the quarter.

Mark, is this sort of the right run rate we should think about for the rest of the year? Could we expect that to get a little bit better here? And because it looks like a lot of the revenue was from CarePoints in the quarter, which I would imagine is lower margin. So if we kind of back that out, does it seem like our software gross margins are running closer to 90% or so? Is the right way to think of it?

Mark Kirshorn, CFO and Chief Operating Officer, Amwell: Yeah, you’re on the right track, Charles. It’s going to be an improving number as the software revenues represent a greater percentage of total revenues. And you’re exactly right, timing of care points would bring that overall number down. We should see that impact from the, let’s call it 75 to 90% software revenue margins that we would profile going out over the next several quarters. As long as the timing hits appropriately, we should continue to see quarter over quarter increases in margin.

Charles Rhyee, Analyst, TD Cowen: And if we would expect then loss to be improving then, any reason not to adjust maybe the EBITDA guide given where we’re starting off here and what you’ve guided for the second quarter? Thanks.

Mark Kirshorn, CFO and Chief Operating Officer, Amwell: Yeah, we’re not changing the EBITDA guide principally because we still have that considerable amount of revenue that we need to generate over the remaining quarters of this year coming in with regard to the expansion work. We’re very confident that the contract extension is now within a month or two of being finalized. We’re far along in that contract negotiation and again, high degree of confidence with respect to that. It’s the expansion that Ito noted and I also noted in the prepared remarks that from a conservative view of 2Q to 2Q, wouldn’t go ahead and change any of those EBITDA ranges today.

Charles Rhyee, Analyst, TD Cowen: Okay, that’s helpful. Thanks. Sure.

Conference Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Jilinder Singh with Truist. Your line is now open.

Jilinder Singh, Analyst, Truist: Yes, thank you and thanks for taking my questions. So all the macro noise, tariff and economic uncertainty, I was curious, have you seen any impact on your sales timeline as health systems continue to evaluate their IT budgets? Just curious how have been your conversations at least in the last couple of months? And related to that, can you guys talk about your direct tariff exposure?

Unnamed Speaker, Company Representative, Amwell: Absolutely. I’ll take it first and then I’ll turn to Marc for his point of view. Essentially, is a palpable pain in the market. People are uncertain and people are worried in way of when they think about their financial viability going forward, that includes many of our customers. The encouraging part is that they see us as part of the solution to this issue.

The analog platform is all about efficiency, it’s all about saving, it’s all about growing revenue, and there are a long list of examples also on our website to show you for it. So the ROI for implementing Amol platform is very significant in where the efficiency, savings, growth, things of that nature. And therefore, we actually see the trend becoming accelerating rather than decelerating despite the overall market sentiment and headwind.

Ito Schoenberg, Chairman and CEO, Amwell: Thank you.

Conference Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Stan Berenstain with Wells Fargo Securities LLC. Your line is now open.

Stan Berenstain, Analyst, Wells Fargo Securities LLC: Yes, hi. Thanks for taking my questions. Maybe just a couple on the government side. In terms of the DHA contract, assuming it’s signed, is there any chance of the economics change at all or is the expectation that they’re going to be somewhat similar to the current contract? And then tangentially, you previously had spoken about six possible government related opportunities that you’re pursuing.

Just curious, any updates there? Anything moving along in that direction? Thank you.

Mark Kirshorn, CFO and Chief Operating Officer, Amwell: Sure. Hi, Stan, it’s Mark. With respect to the contract extension, we don’t really anticipate any material changes in the economics that we provided to Leidos over the past year. Need to recall that contract is relatively recent. Essentially it’s in his first year of workings, especially at enterprise level, which is certainly in quarters one or ’2.

So no indication there that there’d be anything significant. And then I think for the opportunities, perhaps I’ll hand it over to Ito.

Unnamed Speaker, Company Representative, Amwell: Thank you, Mark. So Stan, I think that some people underestimate the enormity of what took place in the last couple of years implementing the DHA. It was a giant undertaking for us, and we went through it. We are now live, as I mentioned earlier, across the globe enterprise for the military health system. That required us to migrate our platform to the gov cloud and check infinite number of boxes and requirements, which we checked and complied with.

It works now well and it works at scale. The impact that we have on the military health system should not be different than other similar government entity, and our partner is very proficient in that environment. Leidos serves so many other organizations. So we believe that with this good execution in the sense that as far as we’re concerned, we were always on time and on budget and we generated the efficiency for our customers here. So that track record that we’re very proud of is going to be very helpful as we compete for other opportunities in the sector.

Stan Berenstain, Analyst, Wells Fargo Securities LLC: Got it. Thanks so much.

Conference Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Eric Percher with Nephron. Your line is now open.

Charles Rhyee, Analyst, TD Cowen: Thank you. Thought I heard this asked, but I’m not sure I heard an answer on the tariff question. Can you just speak to any exposure across the business and maybe specifically on the endpoints?

Unnamed Speaker, Company Representative, Amwell: Sure, Eric. So overall, our direct exposure to tariffs is minimal or to non existent. As you may know, we no longer manufacture most of our hardware comes from third parties and the hardware business, in general, is a very small part of our business today. Our business is software that’s manufactured mostly in The United States and very proudly, and therefore we don’t see a cost issue for us directly. Having said that, tariffs obviously impact the sentiment in the market overall and do create some problems for our customers as it relates to their relationship with other suppliers.

However, as I mentioned earlier, we are really conceived as part of the solution, adding efficiency, growing revenue for our customers, So in that environment, there is a good ROI for investing in Amwell. Maybe very briefly, just to give you some very quick examples, in way of reducing costs and driving revenues, in WellSTART, we just had a study show 35% increase in net revenue for virtual consult. The cohort that I mentioned in the prepared remarks had 1,000,000 cost reduction just with one ED program that created 30 fewer nurses call per day for the Northwell reduced colonoscopy no show by forty eight percent. You know, another area is that we show a path to very significant improvement in outcomes. Again, very quick example.

In the NHS, we help change wait times from sixteen weeks to psychiatric care to one week. That’s very dramatic. And the value is very well recognized there. Even in The US with Horizon, they reported forty percent reduction in patient waiting time for a psychiatric care, and we have very high sentiment with providers and burnout of clinical staff productivity over network is a giant topic for our customers. The fact that you’re fully embedded in the EHR, the fact that we help prepare and match patients with the right doctors and much better prepared in an automated fashion and providing additional access to different specialties, these are just examples of why we believe that our platform still continues to be very relevant and in demand and resonating even in those times of great uncertainty and rising tariffs is a good example of that.

Charles Rhyee, Analyst, TD Cowen: Thanks for the detail.

Conference Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Kevin Caliendo with UBS. Your line is now open.

Jack Sundft, Analyst, UBS: Hey guys, this is Jack Sundft on for Kevin Caliendo. Thanks for taking the questions. I know you’re talking more contract extension through like more of a conservative lens, but maybe if that renewal did not come to fruition, are you confident that you will still breakeven on a free cash flow basis next year without it? Or is that contract kind of needed for it? And then maybe just as a quick follow-up, it might be a little too early, but give any updates on how the selling season, kinda has progressed thus far.

Thanks.

Unnamed Speaker, Company Representative, Amwell: Jack, we we we are quite certain that the contract will be extended. We have no reason to believe based on where we stand and the many reasons I gave earlier in the call that it will not extend. So it’s a bit of a theoretical situation. There is always a theoretical chance, but we believe it’s very, very small. Overall, in our work in the market, we have a product that is extremely well defined.

We divested APC, as you know, we did some other measures, so our core offering today is high value, high margin, high quality, with very strong right to win in the different market segments that we serve. That’s not lost in the market. We see it in how people react to our fees, we see it in sales meeting, and we see it in some of the results that you saw today, and hopefully we’ll continue to see over the foreseeable future. So that’s how we feel about it. Mark, I don’t know if you have anything to add.

Mark Kirshorn, CFO and Chief Operating Officer, Amwell: Know, or Jack, both of you actually, I would add that we clearly are in a position today to rely on that contract extension. Again, we have every reason to believe that we are going to see that extended based on where we stand today with our partners. And of course, if that did not come to fruition, we would have to pivot in order to reach a cash flow from breakeven operations number in 2026. Again, that would be a worst case scenario and not something that we actively plan for, it could be viewed as an existential threat.

Conference Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of David Larson with BTIG. Your line is now open.

Sue Dewey, Head of Investor Relations, Amwell0: Hi, congratulations on the good quarter. Can you just remind us how much revenue in the quarter came from the Defense Health Agency contract? And then what will that figure be like on an annualized basis by say 4Q of twenty five? Thank you.

Mark Kirshorn, CFO and Chief Operating Officer, Amwell: Hi, thanks for those nice remarks. We don’t break out the exact contribution as that we’ve guided in the past that that contract is expected to represent our largest revenue component on an annualized basis when it’s full enterprise. So we’re not yet at full enterprise for all three products, as we noted, we’re there for scheduled visits and we’re waiting for the extension of the automated care and behavioral health, but we did have a quarter and a full quarter of the portion of revenue that comes about from our enterprise wide revenue for scheduled visits.

Sue Dewey, Head of Investor Relations, Amwell0: Great. And then can you maybe just talk a little bit more about like the usage from the Defense Health Agency? Like how many lives actually use the platform in 1Q across how many countries or regions? What was the nature of the services? Is it all behavior or health or is there other things in there as well?

Does it include military families as well, their dependence? And what I’m kind of getting at is like, it seems to me like if they can’t cancel the contract, right? I mean, if the military is dependent on this for large amounts of their care, if they were to cancel that, I mean, would be optically and medically a very difficult thing to do. Just any color around the usage of the platform would be great. Thank you.

Unnamed Speaker, Company Representative, Amwell: Hi, David. Obviously, we cannot speak on behalf of the military health system and not even on behalf of Leidos and what we can say is very restricted. But you are right to suggest, and I think it was public information, that the audience for our is huge. It’s 9,600,000 people in the military, including the men and women in uniform and their families. So the visits, the telehealth visit, the scheduled visits that are now live enterprise is serving all of them, and we are connecting all of them with the providers at large of the military, military providers.

The different use cases are very diversified and include different things. As it relates to chronic care programs and behavioral health, which is such a big area of focus of the military, we are live in the five regions, so we already followed what we did with scheduled visits before, that’s the initial launching pad, if you will, of the military, and then following that, we fully expect to go enterprise, especially as the new head of the DHA takes place. So, and I mentioned earlier that we see very high satisfaction scores, we see efficiency, we have reason to believe that the client and our partner are very pleased with what they see. We obviously don’t speak on their behalf. And that’s why I said earlier that we believe that the likelihood of renewal is very, very high.

It’s not 100% in theory, but we believe that there was a giant leap to get here. It’s performing as planned. It’s generating very important results. Just to give an example, the new administration talked about their goals for the military health system, and they mentioned four pillars. And we believe we check all those four boxes.

So the first pillar was readiness first, ensuring that service members have access to world class healthcare. Obviously, we check that box. The second initiative is medical modernization, advancing digital health, which of course we do. The third one is force optimization and strengthening the medical workflow force. Now we are embedded inside their EHR, the Oracle EHR, connecting them to all their patients, improving their lifestyle, improving their efficiency, it’s overall, we’re very relevant there.

And the last one is really encouraging the military to forge more meaningful strategic partnerships as enhancing collaboration across the DoDVA and of course, MHS with the private sector. And we’re also relevant in that box. So with this track record, with the fact that we are very well positioned to really focus on efficiency, which is such a key element in the new administration, we believe that we have a long future ahead of us together serving this client, which we cannot be more proud of.

Sue Dewey, Head of Investor Relations, Amwell0: Thanks very much. I’ll hop back in the queue.

Conference Operator: Thank you. And our last question comes from the line of Ryan MacDonald with Needham. Your line is now open.

Jack Sundft, Analyst, UBS: Hey, guys. This is Matt Shea on for Ryan. Thanks for taking the questions, and congrats on the strong quarter here. Curious if there’s anything on the churn side to call out in the quarter. And as we think about the remainder of the year, how are you thinking about intentional churn from here?

Do you feel good about the core client base at this point or still some less profitable contracts to clean up? And then just circling back to the selling season question, any color on the selling season would be great. And then any differences you’re seeing in terms of demand from, say, health systems versus payers? Thanks, guys.

Mark Kirshorn, CFO and Chief Operating Officer, Amwell: Sure, hi Matt, it’s Mark. With regard to your first question on churn, we had budgeted for a very conservative churn number, and clearly we were very pleased with the fact that churn came in much lower than we anticipated. That actually helped to contribute to the increase in the bottom line. We had some challenging years prior to this year, and fortunately, I think most of those heavy churn periods are behind us. We continue to budget conservatively, but there’s been nothing that we’ve seen and now that we’re five months in, nothing that we’ve seen to indicate that there’s gonna be any change in that assumption.

On the pipeline growth, on the attractiveness of what we’re bringing to the market, we have also seen significant activity far greater than last year on both the payer side and on the health system side. We’re currently involved in a number of RFPs, RFIs, the amount of interest in the product in these different sectors has fortunately been intensified over the last few months. So contrary to I think what a lot of people are talking about with respect to constraint as tariffs and other indicators have put some apprehension in people’s minds, we seem to be in a good place with prospects that are interested in pursuing our products.

Jack Sundft, Analyst, UBS: That’s great. Thanks, Mark.

Mark Kirshorn, CFO and Chief Operating Officer, Amwell: You’re welcome.

Conference Operator: Thank you. This concludes the question and answer session. I would now like to turn the call back over to Ito Schoenberg for closing remarks.

Unnamed Speaker, Company Representative, Amwell: I want to thank everyone for their time. Thank you very much for your continued interest in Amol and look forward to talking with you offline. Take care.

Conference Operator: This concludes today’s conference call. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.

How does the waiver work?

Through June 30, keep following the rules of your TRICARE Prime plan. These rules are described in the TRICARE Choices in the United States Handbook.

Continue seeing your PCM to get referrals for specialty care, even if your PCM isn’t currently in TriWest’s network. (Note: The point-of-service fee waiver is also extended through Sept. 30. These fees are waived for existing referrals with non-network providers in the West Region.)

During the waiver period, you don’t need to wait for TriWest to approve your referral (unless your PCM is at certain military hospitals or clinics). However, the specialist you see must be TRICARE-authorized.

Here are a few key things to remember:

Ask your PCM for a copy of your referral. Is your PCM at a military hospital or clinic? They may send it:

Through the MHS GENESIS Patient Portal within 3-5 days

In the mail within 3-5 days

To a referral customer service office. You can pick up your copy after your appointment.

When you see your specialist, bring the copy of your referral, dated Jan. 1 through June 30. You can also bring a copy of the TRICARE West Region Referral Approval Waiver Letter. This is available on www.tricare.mil/west.

Not sure how to find a specialist? You can:

Ask your PCM to recommend a local TRICARE-authorized specialist.

See a specialist you’ve seen before, if they’re TRICARE-authorized.

Search TriWest’s provider directory to find specialists in your area.

Are there exceptions to the waiver?

This waiver never applies to:

Inpatient care

Applied behavior analysis or Autism Care Demonstration services

Laboratory developed tests

Extended Care Health Option services

Certain military hospitals and clinics in the West Region have returned to normal referral processing. If your PCM is located at one of these facilities, they’ll let you know. They’ll send your referral to TriWest for processing.

If this applies to you:

Access your approved referral through TriWest’s secure portal. You can also wait to get it in the mail.

Your TriWest portal will have instructions on how to schedule an appointment with the assigned specialist. If there’s a problem or you have questions, call TriWest at 888-TRIWEST (874-9378).

Hey there, fellow mamas! Mia here, and today we're diving into something I wish I'd known more about during my pregnancy – getting a breast pump through TRICARE. Let me tell you, between midnight feedings and trying to figure out which end is up on all this baby gear, the last thing you need is insurance confusion!

My TRICARE Breast Pump Journey (And How to Make Yours Easier)

Picture this: I'm 32 weeks pregnant, waddling around my house, trying to get everything ready for our little one. Between organizing onesies and testing my new Silver Nursing Cups from Go Mommy (total lifesaver for those early nursing days, by the way!), I realized I had no clue how to get my breast pump through TRICARE. Cue the panic googling at 2 AM!

The Basics of TRICARE Breast Pump Coverage

Here's what I discovered: TRICARE actually makes getting a breast pump pretty straightforward – once you know the rules. They cover one breast pump per birth event (fancy way of saying ""per baby""), and you can start the process as early as 27 weeks into your pregnancy. Trust me, don't wait until the last minute like I almost did!

What's Actually Covered?

TRICARE covers both manual and electric breast pumps, plus all those little bits and pieces you need to get started. Think storage bags, flanges, and tubing – basically, everything you need to start your pumping journey. And here's a pro tip: while you're getting your pump sorted, consider grabbing a portable bottle warmer (I love my Go Mommy one for those middle-of-the-night feeds). It's not covered by TRICARE, but it's been worth every penny for those times when baby needs milk NOW.

Explore more on our Portable Bottle Warmer for Travel.

Getting That All-Important Prescription

First things first: you need a prescription from your provider. I know, I know – it seems weird needing a prescription for a breast pump, but them's the rules! When I went to my OB appointment, I just casually mentioned needing one, and she wrote it up right there. Easy peasy!

Choosing Your Breast Pump Path

You've got two main options here, and I've tried both (because apparently, I like to make things interesting). You can either order directly through a TRICARE-approved supplier or buy one yourself and get reimbursed. After trying both routes with my two kids, I definitely recommend going through an approved supplier – way less paperwork!

The Direct Order Route (AKA The Easy Way)

Working with TRICARE-approved suppliers is like having a fairy godmother who handles all the annoying paperwork. These companies know exactly what documentation TRICARE needs, and they'll often help you pick the right pump for your situation. While waiting for my pump to arrive, I spent quality time getting familiar with my Go Mommy baby carrier – because let's be real, you need your hands free sometimes!

Check out The Ultimate Guide to Choosing a Twin Baby Carrier for some tips on finding the perfect carrier for your needs!

My Personal Timeline Tips

Listen up, because this is important: start this process early! I recommend beginning around 30 weeks, which gives you plenty of time to:

- Get your prescription - Research different pumps - Submit your order - Deal with any potential hiccups - Have everything ready before baby arrives

Real talk: those first few weeks with a newborn are INTENSE. The last thing you want is to be dealing with insurance paperwork while trying to figure out breastfeeding. Speaking of which, those Silver Nursing Cups I mentioned earlier? Total game-changer for sore nipples in those early days. But that's a story for another post!

Common Hiccups (And How to Avoid Them)

Look, I've been there – trying to navigate insurance coverage while pregnant and hormonal isn't exactly fun. But I've learned a few tricks to make the process smoother. First, keep ALL your paperwork. Yes, even those random emails from your supplier. Second, don't be afraid to follow up. I called my supplier twice to check on my order status, and I'm glad I did because there was a small issue they needed to resolve.

And here's something I wish someone had told me: if you're planning to exclusively pump or return to work, consider asking about getting spare parts covered. Having backup pieces ready to go has saved my sanity more than once!

Stay tuned for Part 2, where I'll dive into the nitty-gritty details of different pump options and share my personal experiences with various models. In the meantime, remember that you've got this, mama! And if you need some extra support, I'm always here sharing real talk about motherhood – spit-up stains, midnight feeds, and all!

Navigating the World of Breast Pump Options Through TRICARE

Alright mamas, let's pick up where we left off! After figuring out the basics of TRICARE coverage, I found myself staring at what felt like a million different pump options. Talk about overwhelming! Let me break down what I've learned through two babies and countless pumping sessions.

Types of Breast Pumps Covered by TRICARE

Here's the scoop: TRICARE covers several types of pumps, and choosing the right one is crucial. I started with a standard electric pump for my first baby, but ended up needing a hospital-grade pump when my milk supply needed a boost. Thank goodness TRICARE covered both with the right documentation!

Standard Electric Pumps: The Popular Choice

Most moms I know start with a standard electric pump. These are perfect for daily use, especially if you're planning to return to work. They're efficient, portable, and get the job done. Pro tip: while you're setting up your pumping station, consider grabbing a Go Mommy portable bottle warmer. It's been a lifesaver during those middle-of-the-night pump sessions when I need to warm stored milk quickly!

Hospital-Grade Pumps: When You Need Extra Power

Sometimes you need the big guns. Hospital-grade pumps are covered by TRICARE with proper authorization, usually if you're dealing with premature birth, low milk supply, or other specific medical needs. I needed one briefly, and the process was surprisingly smooth once my doctor documented the necessity.

The Supply Situation: What TRICARE Actually Covers

Beyond the pump itself, TRICARE covers essential supplies. This includes flanges, valves, tubes, and storage bottles. Speaking of storage, while organizing my pumping supplies, I found my Silver Nursing Cups from Go Mommy to be perfect for catching letdown - not covered by TRICARE but worth every penny for preventing waste!

Check out our Silver Nursing Cups for more information.

Choosing a TRICARE-Approved Supplier

Working with a TRICARE-approved supplier makes life so much easier. These companies know exactly what documentation is needed and can guide you through the selection process. Plus, they handle all the billing directly with TRICARE - one less thing for your sleep-deprived brain to worry about!

Real Talk: What I Wish I'd Known About Breast Pumps

Can we get honest for a minute? While TRICARE's breast pump coverage is fantastic, there are some things I learned the hard way. Like how important it is to have backup parts (trust me, you don't want to discover a broken valve at 3 AM), or how a hands-free pumping bra is worth its weight in gold. I actually use my Go Mommy baby carrier to stay mobile while managing pump parts and bottles!

The Prescription Process Made Simple

Getting a breast pump prescription through TRICARE isn't as complicated as it sounds. Your healthcare provider can write one during a regular prenatal visit - just remember to ask! The prescription should specify whether you need a standard electric or hospital-grade pump.

Making the Most of Your TRICARE Benefits

Here's something not everyone knows: TRICARE also covers lactation consultants and breastfeeding support. When I was struggling with latch issues (hello, cracked nipples!), these services were invaluable. Combined with my Silver Nursing Cups for healing, I finally got into a comfortable rhythm with feeding.

Tips for Military Moms on the Move

If you're a military family like us, you might be dealing with PCS orders or overseas assignments. Good news: TRICARE's breast pump coverage travels with you! Just make sure to get your pump before any big moves, as the process can be trickier in some overseas locations.

Remember, mama, getting the right breast pump through TRICARE is your right - don't be afraid to advocate for what you need. Whether you're exclusively pumping, combining breast and bottle, or just need backup options, TRICARE has you covered. Stay tuned for Part 3, where I'll share my top tips for making the most of your pump once you get it!

Making the Most of Your TRICARE Breast Pump

Okay mamas, we've covered the basics of getting your breast pump covered by TRICARE, but now let's talk about actually using it! After countless pumping sessions (and I mean countless), I've learned some game-changing tricks that I wish someone had told me earlier.

Setting Up Your Pumping Station

First things first: create a comfy pumping space. I keep my Go Mommy portable bottle warmer right next to my pump because, trust me, you'll want warm milk ready to go when baby's hungry at 3 AM. Speaking of late nights, my Silver Nursing Cups have been lifesavers for catching letdown while nursing on the other side - no more crying over spilled milk!

Discover more about convenient pumping setups at Soap Boobs for some creative ideas!

Maximizing Your Breast Pumps Covered by TRICARE Benefits

Here's something I learned: TRICARE covers replacement parts every few months. Don't wait until your valves are completely worn out - this can affect your pump's efficiency. I mark my calendar to check and replace parts regularly, which has made a huge difference in my pumping output.

Troubleshooting Common Pumping Challenges

When my supply dipped during a stressful PCS move, I discovered that TRICARE covers lactation consultant visits. These experts can help adjust your flange size, check your pump's suction, and offer tips for increasing supply. They're especially helpful if you're using a hospital-grade breast pump and need guidance.

Travel Tips for Military Moms Who Pump

As a military spouse who's always on the move, I've become a pro at mobile pumping. My Go Mommy baby carrier has been incredible for staying hands-free while managing pump parts and bottles during travel. And that portable bottle warmer? Absolute genius for warming milk during layovers!

Discover more about our Baby Carrier.

Storage Solutions and Supply Management

TRICARE covers milk storage bags, but organizing them is an art form. I use a simple filing system: oldest milk in front, newest in back. When my natural way breast pump started showing signs of wear, I learned that TRICARE might cover a replacement if medically necessary - definitely worth asking about!

Making Your Breast Pump Work for You

Remember that prescription breast pump you worked so hard to get? Make it work harder for you! I found that pumping right after morning feeds yields the most milk, and using my Silver Nursing Cups between sessions catches extra ounces I would've missed. Every drop counts!

Building Your Support Network

Connect with other military moms through base support groups or online communities. They're goldmines for tips about breast pump medical supply sources and tricks for dealing with TRICARE. Plus, it's comforting to chat with others who understand the unique challenges of military life and pumping.

Final Thoughts on Your TRICARE Pumping Journey

Listen, mama - whether you're exclusively pumping or just need occasional backup, you've got this! TRICARE's breast pump coverage is there to support you, and with the right tools (hello, Go Mommy lifesavers!), you can make this journey work for you and your little one.

Remember: there's no one-size-fits-all approach to feeding your baby. Some days you'll feel like a pumping champion, others you'll wonder how much does it cost to get your stomach pumped because you drank too much coffee trying to stay awake during night feeds (been there!). It's all part of the adventure.

Your Pumping Success Toolkit

Before I sign off, here's your quick success checklist: keep spare parts handy, know your TRICARE benefits inside and out, and don't hesitate to ask for help when you need it. And if you're wondering about the best place to order TRICARE breast pump supplies, remember that working with approved suppliers makes the whole process smoother.

From one pumping mama to another, you're doing amazing! Keep those Silver Nursing Cups close, your portable bottle warmer ready, and your sense of humor intact. This phase won't last forever, but the memories of successfully navigating it (with help from TRICARE and some carefully chosen gear) definitely will!",https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0815/7164/3688/articles/1746068295621-how-much-does-it-cost-to-get-your-stomach-pumped.webp?v=1746072575,N,1.0,2025-05-02 00:56:34.965819

The American Medical Association (AMA) is urging the Trump administration to take immediate steps to protect and stabilize federal student loan programs essential to the medical profession. In an April 14 letter to the U.S. Department of Education and the Small Business Administration (SBA), AMA raised alarm over ongoing delays in processing income-driven repayment (IDR) applications and growing uncertainty around the future of the Public Service Loan Forgiveness (PSLF) program.

While a March Executive Order from President Trump aimed to “restore” PSLF, it offered few specifics and has not resulted in any immediate changes. In the meantime, physicians are caught in a holding pattern. Although IDR applications are being accepted again, they are still not being processed—a significant barrier for borrowers trying to qualify for PSLF, which requires participation in an IDR plan. AMA warned that this processing backlog is causing “significant stress” for medical students, residents, and early-career physicians who rely on IDR to manage high levels of debt.

Adding to the confusion is the administration’s proposal to dismantle the U.S. Department of Education and shift its functions—including federal student loan servicing—to the SBA. AMA cautioned that such a transfer could disrupt an already fragile system and deter students from pursuing careers in medicine, worsening the projected shortage of 86,000 physicians by 2036.

“Federal loan programs like IDR and PSLF are lifelines for young doctors and vital to ensuring access to care in underserved communities,” said Shannon Udovic-Constant, M.D., president of the California Medical Association (CMA). “We cannot afford to jeopardize the future of our physician workforce.”

AMA emphasized that any policy changes must support—not hinder—the next generation of physicians. “Medical education should never be a barrier to a career in medicine,” the letter concludes. “We must safeguard the financial pathways that make it possible.”

Physicians are encouraged to visit studentaid.gov and consult their loan servicers for up-to-date guidance. CMA will continue to monitor developments and share updates as they become available.

(""Zynex"" or the ""Company"") (NASDAQ: ZYXI) on behalf of purchasers of Zynex securities between March 13, 2023 through March 11, 2025, inclusive (the ""Class Period"").

Investor Deadline: Investors who purchased or acquired Zynex securities during the Class Period may, no later than MAY 19, 2025, seek to be appointed as a lead plaintiff representative of the class. To learn your rights, CLICK HERE.

Zynex, headquartered in Englewood, CO, is a medical device company that makes electrotherapy devices for pain management and rehabilitation.

According to the lawsuit, Defendants failed to disclose to investors that: (1) Zynex shipped products, including electrodes, in excess of demand; (2) as a result, Zynex was able to inflate its revenue; (3) the Company's practice of filing false claims drew scrutiny from insurers, including Tricare; and (4) thus, it was reasonably likely that Zynex would face adverse consequences, including removal from insurer networks and penalties from the federal government.

A lead plaintiff is a representative party who acts on behalf of all class members in directing the litigation. The lead plaintiff is usually the investor or small group of investors who have the largest financial interest and who are also adequate and typical of the proposed class of investors. The lead plaintiff selects counsel to represent the lead plaintiff and the class and these attorneys, if approved by the court, are lead or class counsel. Your ability to share in any recovery is not, however, affected by the decision whether or not to serve as a lead plaintiff. Communicating with any counsel is not necessary to participate or share in any recovery achieved in this case. Any member of the purported class may move the Court to serve as a lead plaintiff through counsel of his/her choice, or may choose to do nothing and remain an inactive class member.

Of the eligible military hospitals participating in the grading assessment, 73% received an ""A"" grade.
Walter Reed National Military Medical Center was the first military test site for Leapfrog surveys.
The Leapfrog Hospital Safety Grade program, updated twice a year, evaluates public and private hospitals.
""These latest grades should bolster our patients’ confidence that they are receiving exceptional care at our military hospitals.""","FALLS CHURCH, Va. - The Defense Health Agency has announced that 16 military hospitals received an ""A"" rating in the latest Leapfrog Hospital Safety Grade assessment for Spring 2025. These high grades reflect the DHA's ongoing dedication to transparency and providing high-quality care to service members and their families.

The Leapfrog Group is a national, independent organization focused on health care quality. The organization evaluates hospitals on a wide range of safety measures, including errors, injuries, and infections. Leapfrog's grading system uses up to 22 evidence-based measures of patient safety.

A hospital must meet specific criteria to be eligible for participation in the Leapfrog safety assessment. In the Spring 2025 ratings, 32% of participating hospitals nationwide received the highest grade. Of the eligible military hospitals participating in the grading assessment, 73% received an ""A"" grade.

""These most recent Leapfrog Safety Grades continue to validate DHA’s commitment to meeting high standards for the patients we are privileged to serve,"" said Dr. Paul Cordts, DHA's Deputy Assistant Director for Medical Affairs and Chief Medical Officer. ""We are proud that the care provided at these facilities ranks among the very best in the nation.""

DHA's engagement with Leapfrog began about seven years ago when it sought to incorporate Leapfrog's evaluations into the Military Health System's Quality Assurance Program. Walter Reed National Military Medical Center was the first military test site for Leapfrog surveys. After seeing positive results, DHA expanded the program across other eligible military hospitals.

""Our participation in this program showcases the consistent rigor our teams apply to safe, effective health care delivery."" said Cordts. "" We are proud of our medical teams’ effort to meet the quality and safety metrics that Leapfrog has set.""

The Leapfrog Hospital Safety Grade program, updated twice a year, evaluates public and private hospitals. Its grades are based on national standards for hospital safety and highlight risks that patients may face in a health care setting, including preventable medical errors and infections. The ratings are available to the public, making it easier for patients to understand the safety standards of their local health care facilities.

The 16 military hospitals that received an “A” grade in Spring 2025 are:

• 81st Medical Group, Keesler Air Force Base, Mississippi

• 673rd Medical Group, Joint Base Elmendorf-Richardson, Alaska

• Alexander T. Augusta Military Medical Center, Fort Belvoir, Virginia

• Blanchfield Army Community Hospital, Fort Campbell, Kentucky

• Brooke Army Medical Center, Fort Sam Houston, Texas

• Carl R. Darnall Army Medical Center, Fort Cavazos, Texas

• Eisenhower Army Medical Center, Fort Eisenhower, Georgia

• Evans Army Community Hospital, Fort Carson, Colorado

• Madigan Army Medical Center, Joint Base Lewis-McChord, Washington

• Martin Army Community Hospital, Fort Benning, Georgia

• Naval Medical Center Camp Lejeune, Camp Lejeune, North Carolina

• Naval Medical Center Portsmouth, Portsmouth, Virginia

• Naval Medical Center San Diego, San Diego, California

• Walter Reed National Military Medical Center, Bethesda, Maryland

• William Beaumont Army Medical Center, Fort Bliss, Texas

• U.S. Naval Hospital Guam, Guam

Some military hospitals were not included in the safety grades this spring because they did not meet the minimum requirements for reporting criteria used by Leapfrog. The DHA has instituted similar criteria internally to ensure patient safety for all facilities that did not qualify for official Leapfrog grades.

""We remain steadfast in our commitment to regular and transparent reporting about the quality of DHA’s health care,"" said Cordts. ""These latest grades should bolster our patients’ confidence that they are receiving exceptional care at our military hospitals.""",https://cdn.dvidshub.net/images/dvids_logo.svg,N,1.0,2025-05-01 11:56:37.272553

As so as your spouse is on Active Duty, you are eligible for Prime or Select.
And, the best part about Tricare prime is that you are not responsible for any kind of copay or coinsurance amount.
Plus with select you don’t need to give birth at the military hospital.
Even when I was seen on base I had ZERO problems, I’ve liked all of my doctors and my care.","Select always (as others have said)! I got pregnant a few months into all the covid shutdowns. This is anecdotal, but our base at the time spaced appointments further apart and every other appt was virtual. They also didn't screen urine each visit - I was appalled and SO thankful to go off post, even having to drive a bit (and pay but never much). I had a history of pre eclampsia, and that didn't seem to matter to the base hospital, which made me scared and sad, especially for other moms who haven't had babies or have any medical background. Definitely go off base always. You can still use the ER on post for emergencies. Congratulations and good luck!!

I've always been on Prime (15ish years) and have had no major issues. I had my first baby at Camp Pendleton, but that's been awhile ago, so I can't really say about how it is currently. I would get on a local Facebook page and ask for input, but keep in mind that people with poor experiences are probably more likely to respond. Camp Pendleton is a teaching hospital so there are often Family Medicine residents that you can be assigned to for OB or newborn care. If you're leaning toward Select, I would get the list of in network providers and call around to check availability before going that way.

As so as your spouse is on Active Duty, you are eligible for Prime or Select. Usually that's when they start training or working full time. Do you already have your military ID card? You are automatically enrolled once you're in DEERs. You'll be in Prime if you're in a Prime Service area or Select if not. You have 90 days to switch if you like. Once you move to Pendleton and update your address in DEERS, you have a 90 day window to switch again.

I always hear military spouses say that select is better because you can pick your doctors and go to specialists without a referral if they are in network with Tricare select plans but… I’ve had Tricare prime for the last 7 years and I’ve never had an issue. I just had a baby too. If I didn’t like the doctor I was assigned to on base I would just call Tricare and ask to be reassigned to someone else. Never had an issue getting referrals once I asked my primary care doctor for them. And, the best part about Tricare prime is that you are not responsible for any kind of copay or coinsurance amount. With select you would have to make some kind of payment until you meet your out of pocket max.

If you’re pregnant then get on select. I hated the military ob where I’m located. Plus with select you don’t need to give birth at the military hospital. I’m sure you will find an ob that will take you. Start calling now. You can make the appt now before you get Tricare. That way if it’s a long wait then you’ll already have it scheduled. With select you have copays though that’s the only downside but you can choose all of your own doctors and to me it was worth it.

Personally, I’ve had Prime the whole time my husband has been in and most of the time the base doctors are full so I’m seen off base anyway. I have some complex medical issues where I need MRI’s and EKG’s and I legit have never, ever paid a dime for medical care. Also all of my prenatal, postnatal and deliveries were 100% free for our two kids too.

Even when I was seen on base I had ZERO problems, I’ve liked all of my doctors and my care. My first pregnancy I was able to see the midwives on base and they were fantastic!

When it comes to getting referrals it’s super easy, I just mention to my PCM what’s going on and typically I’m referred like that.",,N,1.0,2025-05-01 12:56:37.215490

“After assessing the current state of referrals, DHA has decided to extend the referral approval waiver for many beneficiaries,” said Richard Hart, Division Chief, Health Plan Design, TRICARE Health Plan, at the Defense Health Agency.
These fees are waived for existing referrals with non-network providers in the West Region.)
You can also bring a copy of the TRICARE West Region Referral Approval Waiver Letter.
Visit TRICARE West Region Transition.","Do you live in the West Region? Do you have TRICARE Prime? You should know that the Defense Health Agency has extended the West Region referral approval waiver through June 30. TRICARE-authorized specialty care providers don’t need to wait for TriWest Healthcare Alliance to approve referrals issued by your primary care manager before providing outpatient care.

“After assessing the current state of referrals, DHA has decided to extend the referral approval waiver for many beneficiaries,” said Richard Hart, Division Chief, Health Plan Design, TRICARE Health Plan, at the Defense Health Agency. “This waiver extension will ensure that West Region beneficiaries can continue getting specialty care without interruption to their care.”

However, certain military hospitals and clinics have returned to normal referral processing. This phased approach is enabling TriWest to improve its referral processing system. If your PCM is located at one these facilities, TriWest will process your referral. Keep reading to learn more.

How does the waiver work?

Through June 30, keep following the rules of your TRICARE Prime plan. These rules are described in the TRICARE Choices in the United States Handbook.

Continue seeing your PCM to get referrals for specialty care, even if your PCM isn’t currently in TriWest’s network. (Note: The point-of-service fee waiver is also extended through Sept. 30. These fees are waived for existing referrals with non-network providers in the West Region.)

During the waiver period, you don’t need to wait for TriWest to approve your referral (unless your PCM is at certain military hospitals or clinics). However, the specialist you see must be TRICARE-authorized.

Here are a few key things to remember:

Ask your PCM for a copy of your referral. Is your PCM at a military hospital or clinic? They may send it:

Through the MHS GENESIS Patient Portal within 3-5 days

In the mail within 3-5 days

To a referral customer service office. You can pick up your copy after your appointment.

When you see your specialist, bring the copy of your referral, dated Jan. 1 through June 30. You can also bring a copy of the TRICARE West Region Referral Approval Waiver Letter. This is available on www.tricare.mil/west.

Not sure how to find a specialist? You can:

Ask your PCM to recommend a local TRICARE-authorized specialist.

See a specialist you’ve seen before, if they’re TRICARE-authorized.

Search TriWest’s provider directory to find specialists in your area.

Are there exceptions to the waiver?

This waiver never applies to:

Inpatient care

Applied behavior analysis or Autism Care Demonstration services

Laboratory developed tests

Extended Care Health Option services

Certain military hospitals and clinics in the West Region have returned to normal referral processing. If your PCM is located at one of these facilities, they’ll let you know. They’ll send your referral to TriWest for processing.

If this applies to you:

Access your approved referral through TriWest’s secure portal. You can also wait to get it in the mail.

Your TriWest portal will have instructions on how to schedule an appointment with the assigned specialist. If there’s a problem or you have questions, call TriWest at 888-TRIWEST (874-9378).

Zynex Inc’s recent earnings call presented a mixed sentiment, with promising developments such as the FDA submission for their NiCO pulse oximeter and strategic cost reduction initiatives. However, these positives were overshadowed by a significant revenue decline, increased net loss, and ongoing uncertainty regarding the TriCare payment suspension, painting a challenging financial outlook for the company.

NiCO Pulse Oximeter FDA Submission

Zynex has made significant progress with its NiCO pulse oximeter, having completed and passed all EMC and safety tests. The company plans to submit this innovative product to the FDA shortly. The NiCO pulse oximeter is expected to revolutionize the market by providing accurate readings regardless of skin pigmentation, with commercialization anticipated in 2026.

Cost Reduction Measures

In response to current challenges, Zynex has implemented a cost containment strategy, reducing its corporate staff by 15%. This move is expected to result in annual savings of approximately $35 million, helping the company navigate through its financial difficulties.

Diversification of Revenue Streams

Zynex is actively targeting new growth areas, such as personal injury, and has increased the proportion of its diversified product orders to 34% in Q1 2025, up from an average of 30% last year. This diversification is part of the company’s strategy to stabilize and grow its revenue base.

Strong Cash Position

Despite the financial challenges, Zynex maintains a strong balance sheet with $40 million in working capital and approximately $24 million of cash on hand, providing a cushion to support its operations and strategic initiatives.

Significant Revenue Decline

Zynex reported a net revenue decline to $26.6 million in Q1 2025 from $46.5 million in Q1 2024. This decrease was primarily due to a temporary payment suspension from TriCare and reduced sales force productivity, highlighting the company’s current financial struggles.

TriCare Payment Suspension

The temporary suspension of payments from TriCare during a compliance review has significantly impacted Zynex’s revenue. The situation remains unresolved, with a decision expected by June 9th, adding to the company’s financial uncertainty.

Increased Net Loss

Zynex reported a net loss of $10.4 million or $0.33 per share in Q1 2025, compared to a net income of $10,000 in the same quarter last year. This increase in net loss underscores the financial challenges the company is facing.

Decrease in Gross Profit Margin

The gross profit margin for Zynex decreased to 69% in Q1 2025 from 80% in Q1 2024, reflecting the impact of reduced revenue and increased costs on the company’s profitability.

Forward-Looking Guidance

During the earnings call, Zynex provided guidance amidst the challenges posed by TriCare’s temporary payment suspension. The company reported Q1 2025 revenue at $26.6 million, a significant decrease from the previous year. In response, Zynex announced a restructuring plan, including a 15% staff reduction, expected to save approximately $35 million annually. Despite these setbacks, the company remains optimistic about future growth, particularly with the upcoming FDA submission for their NiCO pulse oximeter, which is anticipated to drive revenue in 2026. For Q2 2025, Zynex has projected revenue of $27 million with an EPS loss of $0.20, as they continue to adjust their operations and capitalize on new revenue opportunities.

In summary, Zynex Inc’s earnings call highlighted a challenging financial landscape, marked by a significant revenue decline and increased net loss. Despite these hurdles, the company is taking strategic steps to stabilize its operations, including cost reduction measures and revenue diversification.

We first told you about the issues separating military families from the care they need. Now, some medical practices are at their wits' end.

""I've gotten no communication whatsoever about what's going on other than when I call, 'well, I don't know what's happening. Is it so strange?"" said mental health counselor Stephanie Ryder.

It's been one week since we told you about problems plaguing TRICARE families and the care professionals who serve them.

RELATED |

""There have constantly been reimbursement issues, recruitment interruptions,"" she explained. ""When we call TRICARE, their statement is, 'Well, I don't know what's going on. This is so unusual.""

She's licensed in TRICARE's east and west regions and said some of these issues have happened since before Texas and five other states were switched to TriWest on January 1, 2025.

""TriWest as a region serves over 4.5 million beneficiaries. More than 937,000 of those people live in Texas.

The military advocacy group 'Mission Alpha Advocacy' surveyed 399 West Region families. 75% of them said they've had their medical services disrupted since the switch, while 51% said they've had some sort of billing issue.

So we reached out to TriWest directly.

In a statement sent to us after our first story, their team said in part:

""Paying provider claims accurately and quickly is a top priority at TriWest. To date, TriWest has processed more than $6 million in TRICARE claims totaling $830 million, including 167,000 autism claims — a particular area of focus for TriWest.'

That statement brought up more questions.

Destany Fuller: 'Do you feel that commitment to solving issues?'

Ryder: "" I don't. I think that's an impressive statement to make.. Let's be upfront about it. Communicate with your service members.""

To keep her practice afloat, Ryder decided to withdraw from working with TRICARE, calling the decision difficult but necessary.

""This is a benefit that they have earned,"" Ryder said about military families. ""They have earned through blood, sweat, tears, quite literally. They deserve an explanation. If you're not going to explain it to providers, explain it to the people that you owe this to.""

We've reached out to 'TriWest' since our first story aired, asking what they're doing to fix these issues.

They sent us a statement Wednesday, reading in part: ""Our dedicated team is working diligently to resolve outstanding claims issues and help ensure payment to TRICARE providers.""

We also reached out to the Deputy Health Agency (DHA) with those same questions.

DHA representatives told us they'd have answers for us on Thursday.

We'll let you know what they say.

FULL STATEMENT:

“To date, TriWest Healthcare Alliance has processed more than 7.3 million TRICARE claims totaling more than $1 billion. Our dedicated team is working diligently to resolve outstanding claims issues and help ensure payment to TRICARE providers.

Additionally, ensuring continuity of care for TRICARE beneficiaries is a top priority for us, and we recognize that disruptions in behavioral health care are especially impactful. That’s why we’ve placed an emphasis on building a strong network of providers to care for beneficiaries with behavioral health issues, including Autism. Our network includes more than 1.4 million provider access points across specialties in the West region, including 150,000 behavioral health providers.

Finally, while VA is distinct from TRICARE, our long, successful partnership with VA demonstrates our ability to build a robust community health care system for our military community.

“It’s very meaningful to be here in front of you given your critical and vital mission,” Cnossen told conference attendees.","The annual Military Health System Conference launched on April 29, 2025, with the theme, “Future of Military Medicine: Integrated, Innovative, Ready.” Topics at the conference, held in Cleveland, Ohio, focused on ongoing efforts to stabilize, strengthen, and modernize the MHS.

Jules W. Hurst III, performing the duties of Under Secretary of Defense for Personnel and Readiness, opened the conference, stating, “Our number one responsibility is making sure that our medical professionals are ready to provide lifesaving care on the battlefield.”

“We also have a responsibility to be prepared to support the men and women who volunteer to go overseas and fight our nation’s wars,” he added.

Underscoring his role as an advocate for the MHS, Hurst said, “I am going to advocate for you to receive the resources you need…and ask for better policies and authorities to let you provide the kind of patient care that you want to provide, so we can be world-class leaders in medical care.”

Hurst discussed the need to further coordinate with the Department of Veterans Affairs, strengthen relationships with public and private institutions, and increase opportunities for military healthcare workers to enhance their skillsets.

‘Medical Readiness is Combat Readiness’

The MHS Conference is a four-day annual conference hosted by the Office of the Assistant Secretary of Defense for Health Affairs. Attendees include government civilian, military, and private-sector healthcare professionals. The conference offers opportunities for knowledge sharing, advancing innovation, and highlighting exciting new initiatives within the MHS.

Addressing just under 2,000 personnel from across the MHS, Dr. Stephen Ferrara, Acting Assistant Secretary of Defense for Health Affairs, said, “We have a unique mission in that we are the only U.S. healthcare program that goes to war. That separates us from all other healthcare systems, and that is what makes us unique.”

“The geopolitical environment is incredibly challenging,” he said. “The margin between calm and chaos is quite thin. The threats are incredibly real, and if, and when, (something) occurs, the country looks to the military and the Military Health System to keep (it) safe. And so we have to be ready to meet that call.”

Ferrara highlighted three priorities for the MHS:

• Support our warfighters to ensure they are fit to fight by ensuring they have access to care during peacetime.

• Sustain medical skills by increasing the volume and complexity of patient care in our hospitals.

• Strengthen our force generation platform by continuing to train thousands of early- and mid-career healthcare professionals in military hospitals and clinics.

“We’re also forging new partnerships, both government, civilian, and military partnerships to bring in more patients—to be able to make sure that we're getting as many patients as possible into the military medical hospitals and clinics, and to get our people trained,” said Ferrara.

Ferrara said it’s important to make sure the MHS is “better than we found it, and to leave the next generation of warfighters in skilled and secure hands. Those future generations are going to be the ones that take care of our children and our grandchildren when they go out in uniform.”

Acknowledging the Department of Defense budget as an important issue, he said, “We show our value by how we keep the guns in the fight. When the soldier goes into battle carrying the sword of freedom, we are their armor, and we are their shield.”

Retired Navy SEAL Shares Story of Recovery

Dan Cnossen, a retired U.S. Navy SEAL and a Paralympian, delivered the keynote address. Cnossen lost both of his legs above the knee from an improvised explosive device while serving in Afghanistan and received his care in the MHS.

To recover from his injuries, stay busy and in shape, he took up cross-country skiing, and has competed for Team USA in the 2018 and 2022 Winter Paralympics.

Cnossen talked about his injury and the immediate aftermath, the recovery process, and his path to becoming a world-class Paralympian.

“It’s very meaningful to be here in front of you given your critical and vital mission,” Cnossen told conference attendees. “The mission is vital… I am alive on this high platform because of the MHS. This is a success story.”

Following the morning plenary and keynote speakers, conference attendees chose from dozens of break-out sessions featuring distinguished military medical leaders, with topics including operationalizing workforce engagement, DOD and VA collaboration, the Defense Health Agency’s My Military Health program, infectious disease research, the DOD’s blood program, force generation and sustainment, and much more.",https://d1ldvf68ux039x.cloudfront.net/thumbs/photos/2504/9004768/1000w_q95.jpg,N,1.0,2025-05-01 01:56:45.117088

Unfortunately, this isn't Jefferson's first experience with burglary as a business owner.","WACO, Texas — The owner of Hardware Junky, a tech store near Baylor University's campus, is dealing with a significant financial setback following a weekend break-in where thieves stole thousands of dollars worth of electronics.

According to Aldo Jefferson, CEO and owner of Hardware Junky, the incident occurred shortly before 5 a.m. on Saturday. Two suspects entered through the back of the store and stole items from the front.

Jefferson was attending a class when he received a text from his weekend employee.

""I called him,"" said Jefferson. ""He's like, 'Yeah, did you see the picture?' I'm like, 'What happened?' He's like, 'I don't know.' So I drove straight over here. My partner, who owns Waco Custom Phones, was here, and we got robbed.""

According to Jefferson, the employee initially thought the mess was caused by the previous night's storm, not realizing the store had been burglarized.

Jefferson described how the suspects gained entry through an unconventional method: they removed the exterior siding, peeled up the back wall, and kicked through the drywall to enter the premises.

""You know the Kool-Aid man, he busted the wall and goes, 'Oh yeah!,"" said Jefferson. ""They busted in like the Kool-Aid man.""

The burglars attempted to open the cash register, stole phone cases from the front of the store, and took an empty, unused register. One of the suspects returned approximately 45 minutes later and filled bags with expensive technology.

""The cost to replace is almost $10,000, and that doesn't include the cost of the wall and stuff,"" Jefferson said.

Jefferson believes the suspect felt comfortable returning because the store's alarm system failed to activate, he thinks due to a broken sensor.

While Jefferson hopes insurance will cover most of the loss, he still faces immediate out-of-pocket expenses.

""But my deductible is $1,000,"" said Jefferson. ""I gotta pay that out of pocket, so it's already costing me money, but it's part of being in business.""

Unfortunately, this isn't Jefferson's first experience with burglary as a business owner.

""When I first got broken into on Waco Drive, they threw a weight through the window,"" Jefferson recalled.

He said the Waco Police Department has been helpful and is conducting an ongoing investigation.

""Hopefully these people get caught,"" said Jefferson. ""If not, her name is Karma, and she's mean.""

Despite the setback, Jefferson is determined to maintain his positive attitude and continue running his business.

""A lot of people are like, 'Well how can you be happy and positive about this?,"" said Jefferson. ""And I'm like, well, I'm not gonna let anything take my happiness, my joy. Why stress over this? This is life.""

The payment issues appear to stem from technical failures in TriWest's new system.
Despite efforts to place clients with other providers, Brown-Miller says most clinics have already reduced services or limited TRICARE patients due to payment concerns.
Many therapy centers are now refusing to accept new TRICARE patients, leading to longer waitlists and reduced access to care.","KILLEEN, Texas — Dozens of families in Central Texas are scrambling to find therapy services for their children after 3D ABA Therapy Center announced it will close its doors tomorrow, the latest casualty in a growing healthcare crisis affecting TRICARE beneficiaries.

The clinic, which has served the Killeen community since September 2021, is shutting down after months of payment issues with TriWest Healthcare Alliance, the new regional contractor for TRICARE, which took over from Humana Military on Jan. 1.

""We weren't having any concerns about our clinic being closed down. We were feeling that everything was picking up,"" said Elizabeth Brown-Miller, owner and clinical director of 3D ABA. ""But then my clinical director noticed that some of our payments were not adding up the way they were supposed to.""

Brown-Miller discovered that since the contractor transition, the clinic has been paid less than 50% of its contracted rates, when it has been paid at all.

""We found out that we were not being paid at the correct rate. We were being paid less than 50% of the contracted rate. It's pennies on the dollar — like $8 to $9 an hour for direct services,"" she explained.

For military spouse Tamia Cook, whose son has received therapy at 3D ABA for nearly three years, the closure is devastating.

""When my son first got here, no words, no communication, eloping, just a lot of things that come with that territory. He's grown so much,"" Cook said. ""I've been crying all week. I'm very emotional.""

Cook's son was diagnosed with level 3 autism and has made significant progress in his communication skills during his time at the clinic. Now, she's touring different facilities but fears nothing will match what they're losing.

Juan Griffin, another parent affected by the closure, said the clinic continued caring for his son even after payments stopped coming in.

""Even when they started not getting paid, they volunteered to keep seeing my son,"" Griffin said. ""My son is level 3. He barely started talking. When he arrived, he was only saying about 23 words. Now he's got like 60 words and he's starting to put them together.""

Griffin expressed frustration with TRICARE's response to the crisis: ""It's just unbelievable that TRICARE is supposed to be helping veterans, but then they turn their back on the people who support our community.""

The payment issues appear to stem from technical failures in TriWest's new system. Since Jan. 1, when TriWest took over as TRICARE's contractor for Texas, Arkansas, Illinois, Louisiana, Oklahoma, and Wisconsin, therapy providers across the region have reported similar problems.

Industry reports indicate the transition has been plagued by technology failures, with providers spending hours on hold with customer service, receiving inconsistent answers, and having no clear timeline for resolution.

The impact extends beyond military families. Crystal Jenkins, whose son isn't covered by TRICARE but by private insurance, is now considering taking him four hours away to continue receiving services.

""It's been very stressful. I've lost a lot of sleep,"" Jenkins said. ""I stay up late at night trying to figure out financially what we need to do to try to send our son somewhere, find a place that doesn't have a long wait list.""

Brown-Miller said the decision to close came after taking out high-interest loans to keep the clinic afloat while waiting for the payment issues to be resolved.

""Our debt has gone up and up because we took out high-interest loans to float the clinic,"" she explained. In January and February, we didn't get paid. We got a couple of checks in March and then nothing in April.""

The clinic now faces a debt of $180,000. Despite efforts to place clients with other providers, Brown-Miller says most clinics have already reduced services or limited TRICARE patients due to payment concerns.

""I feel devastated,"" Brown-Miller said. ""The analogy I use with the parents was imagine you're a parent and you're doing everything right, but because of some paperwork issues, CPS has come and taken your kids. That's how I feel about this clinic, about the kids. They're our kids.""

The Department of Defense has acknowledged issues with the transition and implemented temporary measures, including extending some authorizations through June and waiving certain referral requirements through March.

Lieutenant General Telita Crosland, who oversees the Defense Health Agency, sent a letter to beneficiaries on January 31 promising they would not lose healthcare coverage due to the transition.

However, providers say these measures are insufficient without a functioning payment system. Many therapy centers are now refusing to accept new TRICARE patients, leading to longer waitlists and reduced access to care.",https://media.kcentv.com/assets/KCEN/images/b8d37721-ed21-4bcf-802c-777ffc61004c/20250430T223458/b8d37721-ed21-4bcf-802c-777ffc61004c_1140x641.jpg,N,-1.0,2025-04-30 18:56:22.483713

Omnicare is the largest pharmacy serving the nursing home sector.

A jury found Omnicare billed Medicare, Medicaid and TRICARE for over 3 million false claims resulting in almost $135.6 million in damages, totaling “one of the largest damages verdicts rendered by a jury in a False Claims Act case,” according to the U.S. Dept. of Justice. That amount is expected to grow to more than $406 million given that the federal government is under the False Claims Act entitled to three times the amount of the damages.

During the four-week trial, the jury also found CVS Health liable for causing Omincare to submit false claims.

A spokesperson for CVS Health said the company plans to appeal the decision.

“This lawsuit centered on a highly technical prescription dispensing record keeping issue that was allowed by law in many states. The dispensing practices referenced were limited to Omnicare, ended in 2018, were used by many others in the industry at the time, and were accepted by CMS,” Amy Thibault, executive director of corporate communications, external affairs at Omnicare, told Senior Housing News. “There was no claim in this case that any patient paid for a medication they shouldn’t have or that any patient was harmed.”

According to the Dept. of Justice, Omnicare is alleged to have distributed drugs that were not supported by valid prescriptions under state law between 2010 and 2018, which it then billed to Medicare, Medicaid and TRICARE.

Omnicare pharmacist Uri Bassan originally filed the lawsuit on behalf of the federal government, 29 states and the District of Columbia in 2015, according to legal publication Law360. The federal government in 2019 filed a complaint against CVS and Omnicare alleging the pharmacy “‘rolled over’ prescriptions for elderly and disabled individuals living in more than 3,000 residential long-term care facilities, including assisted living facilities operated by the largest long-term care providers in the country, such as Brookdale Senior Living, Atria Senior Living, Sunrise Senior Living Services, and Five Star Senior Living.”

Specifically, the government alleged Omnicare’s computer system assigned a new prescription number, or even a fake number of authorized refills, so that pharmacists could keep dispensing those medications and Omnicare could keep getting paid. The suit alleged that Omnicare allowed prescriptions to roll over in at least 1,766 residential facilities between 2010 and 2018.

Omnicare and CVS sought a dismissal of the case with an argument that centered on the fact that regulation prohibiting companies from filling prescriptions came about only in 2013. The companies also said that state laws gave them the ability to refill expired prescriptions for certain kinds of health facilities, and that CVS was not subject to the case given it was not directly involved in Omnicare’s operations.

That argument ultimately did not convince U.S. District Court Judge Colleen McMahon and the case proceeded, according to Law360.",https://skillednursingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/4/2019/03/SNN-Facebook-Share-Size.jpg,N,-1.0,2025-04-30 18:56:26.688694

What You Need to Know: The U.S. Defense Health Agency has for a second time extended the temporary waiver of certain authorization and referral requirements for TRICARE patients.

On January 1, 2025, TriWest Healthcare Alliance (TriWest) began providing managed care services to TRICARE beneficiaries in the 26-state western region, including California. Due to challenges related to the transition of managed care responsibilities to the incoming contractor, the U.S. Defense Health Agency has extended the temporary waiver for authorization and referral requirements on all outpatient TRICARE-covered services for TRICARE Prime beneficiaries in the West Region. The waiver will now be in place through June 30, 2025.

During this time, providers will not need to submit referral or authorization requests for TRICARE Prime patients seeking TRICARE-covered outpatient services, with some exceptions. Authorizations and referral requests will still be required for inpatient care, applied behavior analysis, laboratory developed test and Extended Health Care Option services.

According to the TRICARE West Region Referral Waiver Approval Letter, TRICARE Prime enrollees can obtain covered outpatient services from any TRICARE-authorized provider (network or non-network) during the waiver period without obtaining separate referral approval from TriWest.

Referrals for care that extends beyond June 30, 2025, will need to follow the prior established TRICARE referral and authorization requirements and obtain approval to continue care after June 30. Referrals issued after June 30, 2025, will be subject to normal TRICARE referral and authorization requirements.

Physicians with questions regarding the TRICARE transition should visit the new TriWest TRICARE Provider webpage or contact TriWest at providerservices@triwest.com or (888) 874-9378.

“After assessing the current state of referrals, DHA has decided to extend the referral approval waiver for many beneficiaries,” said Richard Hart, Division Chief, Health Plan Design, TRICARE Health Plan, at the Defense Health Agency.
These fees are waived for existing referrals with non-network providers in the West Region.)
You can also bring a copy of the TRICARE West Region Referral Approval Waiver Letter.
Visit TRICARE West Region Transition.","Do you live in the West Region? Do you have TRICARE Prime? You should know that the Defense Health Agency has extended the West Region referral approval waiver through June 30. TRICARE-authorized specialty care providers don’t need to wait for TriWest Healthcare Alliance to approve referrals issued by your primary care manager before providing outpatient care.

“After assessing the current state of referrals, DHA has decided to extend the referral approval waiver for many beneficiaries,” said Richard Hart, Division Chief, Health Plan Design, TRICARE Health Plan, at the Defense Health Agency. “This waiver extension will ensure that West Region beneficiaries can continue getting specialty care without interruption to their care.”

However, certain military hospitals and clinics have returned to normal referral processing. This phased approach is enabling TriWest to improve its referral processing system. If your PCM is located at one these facilities, TriWest will process your referral. Keep reading to learn more.

How does the waiver work?

Through June 30, keep following the rules of your TRICARE Prime plan. These rules are described in the TRICARE Choices in the United States Handbook.

Continue seeing your PCM to get referrals for specialty care, even if your PCM isn’t currently in TriWest’s network. (Note: The point-of-service fee waiver is also extended through Sept. 30. These fees are waived for existing referrals with non-network providers in the West Region.)

During the waiver period, you don’t need to wait for TriWest to approve your referral (unless your PCM is at certain military hospitals or clinics). However, the specialist you see must be TRICARE-authorized.

Here are a few key things to remember:

• Ask your PCM for a copy of your referral. Is your PCM at a military hospital or clinic? They may send it:

• Through the MHS GENESIS Patient Portal within 3-5 days

• In the mail within 3-5 days

• To a referral customer service office. You can pick up your copy after your appointment.

• When you see your specialist, bring the copy of your referral, dated Jan. 1 through June 30. You can also bring a copy of the TRICARE West Region Referral Approval Waiver Letter. This is available on www.tricare.mil/west.

• Not sure how to find a specialist? You can:

• Ask your PCM to recommend a local TRICARE-authorized specialist.

• See a specialist you’ve seen before, if they’re TRICARE-authorized.

• Search TriWest’s provider directory to find specialists in your area.

Are there exceptions to the waiver?

This waiver never applies to:

• Inpatient care

• Applied behavior analysis or Autism Care Demonstration services

• Laboratory developed tests

• Extended Care Health Option services

Certain military hospitals and clinics in the West Region have returned to normal referral processing. If your PCM is located at one of these facilities, they’ll let you know. They’ll send your referral to TriWest for processing.

If this applies to you:

• Access your approved referral through TriWest’s secure portal. You can also wait to get it in the mail.

• Your TriWest portal will have instructions on how to schedule an appointment with the assigned specialist. If there’s a problem or you have questions, call TriWest at 888-TRIWEST (874-9378).

The counties affected are Cleveland, Comanche, and Cotton.

To receive an emergency refill of prescription medications, TRICARE beneficiaries should take their prescription bottle to any TRICARE retail network pharmacy. If the bottle is unavailable or the label is damaged or missing, beneficiaries should contact Express Scripts, Inc., or their retail network pharmacy for assistance.

To find a network pharmacy, beneficiaries may call Express Scripts at 1-877-363-1303, or search the network pharmacy locator.

If possible, visit the pharmacy where the prescription was filled. Prescriptions filled by a retail chain may be filled at another store in that chain. If the clinician who prescribed the medication is available, beneficiaries can ask them to call in a new prescription to any network pharmacy.

As a reminder, TRICARE beneficiaries, other than active duty service members, may receive urgent care from any TRICARE-authorized urgent care center or provider and do not need a referral. This allows beneficiaries to seek nonemergency care for illnesses or injuries if their primary care provider is unavailable because of emergencies. Any TRICARE beneficiary who reasonably believes they have an emergency should always call 911 or, go to the nearest emergency room.

Beneficiaries are advised to visit Express Scripts’ Weather Notices page for updates.

Do you pay for your TRICARE coverage using a bank electronic funds transfer, credit card, or debit card?

If you haven’t done so already, you must securely provide your payment information to the West Region contractor, TriWest Healthcare Alliance, by April 30. If you haven’t submitted payment to TriWest by April 30, you and your family members will be disenrolled from your TRICARE plan on May 1. This disenrollment is retroactive to your paid-through date. You’ll receive a letter from DMDC informing you of the disenrollment.

Note: You don’t need to take any action if you have TRICARE For Life, the US Family Health Plan, or a TRICARE health plan overseas.

If you haven’t made any payments for coverage this year, your disenrollment will date back to Jan. 1. This means you’ll be responsible for paying the full cost of any healthcare services you or your family members have received this calendar year.

“We want to ensure that everyone who wants to keep their TRICARE plan has a chance to reinstate their coverage,” explained Malcolm Jones, enrollment specialist, TRICARE Health Plan, at the Defense Health Agency. “But if you’re disenrolled, you must take action now to reinstate your coverage—it won’t be automatic.”

Keep reading to learn more about your reinstatement options.

How to request reinstatement

Do you want to reinstate your TRICARE coverage? You can do so any time before June 30. Call TriWest at 888-TRIWEST (874-9378) and say that you’ve been disenrolled and would like to reinstate your enrollment. (Note: You can’t request reinstatement via TriWest’s portal.)

If you don’t request reinstatement by June 30, you won’t have TRICARE medical coverage.

To be reinstated, you’ll need to provide your payment information to TriWest and pay all overdue enrollment fees or premiums back to Jan. 1.

Don’t want to reinstate your coverage?

If you don’t want to reinstate your TRICARE coverage, you don’t need to take any action. But remember: If you don’t request reinstatement before June 30, you can only get care at a military hospital or clinic if space is available.

If you’re eligible for TRICARE Prime or TRICARE Select, you’ll need to wait until the next TRICARE Open Season, which begins in November, to enroll in a plan for coverage beginning Jan. 1, 2026. Or you’ll need to wait until you have a qualifying life event, which opens a 90-day period for you to enroll in a TRICARE health plan. (QLEs include major life changes like marriage, birth, or moving, as described in the TRICARE Qualifying Life Events Fact Sheet.)

If you had a TRICARE premium-based plan, you won’t be able to purchase coverage for 12 months from your disenrollment date. These plans include:

TRICARE Young Adult

TRICARE Reserve Select

TRICARE Retired Reserve

Want to avoid the need to update your TRICARE payment method in the future? Consider switching to paying by allotment. To learn how to set up payment by allotment, check out the Defense Financing and Accounting Service’s Allotments page.

If you have questions about your payment options, visit West Region Payment Options. Remember: Reinstating your TRICARE coverage now will ensure that you don’t need to pay the full cost of your healthcare services this year.",https://www.militaryspot.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/tricare-reinstatement.png,N,0.0,2025-04-30 13:56:34.373463

A: The Q1 revenue miss was due to various factors, including changes with payers. We haven't provided full-year guidance yet as we're waiting for more clarity on TRICARE.

LOS ANGELES, April 29, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- The Portnoy Law Firm advises Zynex, Inc. (""Zynex"" or the ""Company"") (NASDAQ: ZYXI) investors of a class action representing investors that bought securities between March 13, 2023 and March 11, 2025, inclusive (the ""Class Period""). Zynex investors have until May 19, 2025 to file a lead plaintiff motion.

Investors are encouraged to contact attorney Lesley F. Portnoy, by phone 310-692-8883 or email: lesley@portnoylaw.com, to discuss their legal rights, or click here to join the case. The Portnoy Law Firm can provide a complimentary case evaluation and discuss investors’ options for pursuing claims to recover their losses.

The class action lawsuit against Zynex, Inc. alleges that the company and certain of its executives made materially false or misleading statements and/or failed to disclose key information during the Class Period. Specifically, the complaint asserts that:

(i) Zynex shipped medical products, including electrodes, in quantities that exceeded patient needs;

(ii) this practice led to inflated revenue figures;

(iii) the submission of potentially improper claims attracted scrutiny from insurers, including Tricare; and

(iv) as a result, Zynex faced a heightened risk of negative consequences, such as exclusion from insurer networks and possible penalties from federal agencies.

The lawsuit further cites a report published by STAT on June 4, 2024, titled “How a device maker inundated pain patients with unwanted batteries and surprise bills.” The report alleged that Zynex operated an ""oversupplying scheme"" by routinely sending excessive quantities of supplies such as electrode pads and batteries, thereby enabling the company to bill insurers for significantly more than what would be justified under standard usage. Following the release of this report, Zynex's stock declined by more than 5%, according to the complaint.

Additionally, on March 11, 2025, Zynex announced its financial results for the fourth quarter and full year 2024, disclosing a notable revenue shortfall attributed to “slower than normal payments from certain payers.” The company also revealed that Tricare had temporarily suspended payments pending a review of previous claims. Following this announcement, Zynex’s stock price fell by more than 51%, according to the lawsuit.

Then I found if you click on Triwest HealthCare Alliance in blue bold text, at the top of the page in a red area it says—

“Live in the West Region? There is now a referral approval waiver in place through June 30, 2025. Learn More About the Referral Approval Waiver

Also, you have until April 30 to set up your payment info if you pay by EFT, credit card, or debit card. This is for TRICARE Prime, TRICARE Select, TYA, TRS, and TRR plans. If you miss this deadline, you will be disenrolled back to Jan. 1. Visit www.tricare.mil/west today.” —-

I have select and was told I needed referrals for certain services (after 10 years of never needing them), and had to scramble and still lost a provider because Tricare didn’t pay them. They’re a mess currently. I’d add a payment method anyway, just so you don’t get disenrolled, then call them and figure it out.

The Portnoy Law Firm can provide a complimentary case evaluation and discuss investors’ options for pursuing claims to recover their losses.

The class action lawsuit against Zynex, Inc. alleges that the company and certain of its executives made materially false or misleading statements and/or failed to disclose key information during the Class Period. Specifically, the complaint asserts that:

(i) Zynex shipped medical products, including electrodes, in quantities that exceeded patient needs;

(ii) this practice led to inflated revenue figures;

(iii) the submission of potentially improper claims attracted scrutiny from insurers, including Tricare; and

(iv) as a result, Zynex faced a heightened risk of negative consequences, such as exclusion from insurer networks and possible penalties from federal agencies.

The lawsuit further cites a report published by STAT on June 4, 2024, titled “How a device maker inundated pain patients with unwanted batteries and surprise bills.” The report alleged that Zynex operated an ""oversupplying scheme"" by routinely sending excessive quantities of supplies such as electrode pads and batteries, thereby enabling the company to bill insurers for significantly more than what would be justified under standard usage. Following the release of this report, Zynex's stock declined by more than 5%, according to the complaint.

Additionally, on March 11, 2025, Zynex announced its financial results for the fourth quarter and full year 2024, disclosing a notable revenue shortfall attributed to “slower than normal payments from certain payers.” The company also revealed that Tricare had temporarily suspended payments pending a review of previous claims. Following this announcement, Zynex’s stock price fell by more than 51%, according to the lawsuit.
