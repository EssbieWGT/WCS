Dr. Stephen Ferrara, acting assistant secretary of defense for health affairs, presented the awards to the winning individuals and teams. Their research spanned diverse topics, including warfighter readiness, traumatic brain injury, PTSD, and mental health.

Individual Distinguished Service Award Winners

Two researchers in the military medical community were recognized for significant contributions to the success of Military Health System medical studies supporting the deployed warfighter.

In the research category, “Innovation and Current Directions in Military Suicide Prevention, Research, and Programs,” Retired U.S. Air Force Col. (Dr.) Robert Ursano, director of the Center for the Study of Traumatic Stress and professor of psychiatry and neuroscience at the Uniformed Services University, was honored for advancing mental health care, resilience, and trauma research in support of the health and well-being of warfighters.

Ursano’s key research included combat stress, posttraumatic stress disorder, and traumatic brain injury, with a focus in suicide prevention. The findings from his work provided essential data informing suicide prevention efforts and the understanding of risk and resilience in service members. The PTSD Brain Bank provides a lasting resource for future research aimed at developing better treatments. Through his leadership of CSTS, he oversaw the development and dissemination of training and intervention programs aimed at improving the psychological health of service members and families exposed to trauma and disaster.

In the research category, “Optimizing the Human Weapon System: Utilizing Wearable Sensor Data to Inform Readiness,” Dr. Karl Friedl, senior research scientist of performance physiology, U.S. Army Research Institute of Environmental Medicine, was recognized as a leader in service member health and performance. Friedl's research focused on extending limits of human physiological performance, with contributions including endocrine regulation in semi-starvation, physiological effects of anabolic steroids, body composition methods and standards, physiological monitoring, and metrics of research.

Outstanding Research Accomplishment

Individual awards were given to three researchers for outstanding research contributions supporting the warfighter with significant accomplishments of high impact achieved since February 2024.

Justin Baker, who has a doctorate in psychology, assistant professor of psychiatry and behavioral health, Ohio State University College of Medicine, was recognized for his work in the category, “Innovation and Current Directions in Military Suicide Prevention, Research, and Programs.”

Baker's work focused on increasing the reach and accessibility of suicide prevention treatments through research that advances group therapy, telehealth, virtual learning platforms, and other innovative resources for service members struggling with suicidal thoughts and behaviors. His accomplishments stem from leading successful military-academic partnerships to help warfighters return to operational readiness and build resilience skills.

Mary Jo Pugh, a retired U.S. Air Force nurse who has a doctorate in psychology, and professor, Division of Epidemiology at the University of Utah School of Medicine, was recognized for her work in the category, “Evolving Methods for the Analysis of Large Complex Data Sources to Inform Military Health Policy, Readiness, Performance and Medical Practices.” She is also an investigator at the Informatics, Decision-Enhancement and Analytic Sciences Center of Innovation and the Department of Veterans Affairs Salt Lake City.

Pugh made groundbreaking contributions to research on TBI on multiple morbidity in veterans. She pioneered the integration of Department of Defense and VA data, revolutionizing the study of military exposures and complex comorbidities. Her leadership in the LIMBIC Phenotype study, encompassing over 2.5 million post-9/11 veterans, unveiled critical insights into TBI phenotypes and their associated outcomes. Pugh's innovative application of complexity theory and her dedication to advancing research methodologies significantly enhanced understanding of deployed warfighter and veteran health.

U.S. Army Capt. (Dr.) Maya Alexandri, J.D., U.S. Army Medical Corp, was recognized in the category, “Portable Medical & Dental Imaging in the Far Forward Environment.”

Alexandri led groundbreaking research measuring the electromagnetic signature of handheld ultrasound systems, otherwise known as EMS and HUS, as a crucial step for ensuring safe use in austere, high-risk combat environments. Her pilot study, conducted with the DOD’s Joint Electromagnetic Warfare Center, found that the EMS of HUS probes is negligible—undetectable at distances beyond 10 feet—suggesting they likely can be safely used without risking adversary detection. This first-of-its-kind research lays the foundation for U.S. Army doctrine integrating HUS into far-forward military medical care.

Warfighter Medical Research Public Communication

Doug Jones, who has a doctorate in movement and sport sciences, research physiologist, and director for the Warfighter Performance Department’s Thermal Physiology Lab, Naval Health Research Center, and team member, Dr. Timothy Dunn, who has a doctorate in cognitive psychology, cognitive scientist, Warfighter Performance Department, were recognized for contributions to broadening the general public's awareness of DOD-sponsored warfighter-related medical research through public communications in the category, “Polar Performance at Altitude and Arctic Activities.”

Jones and Dunn significantly advanced understanding of warfighters’ physiological and cognitive responses to operating in extreme environments. Their dedication and scientific rigor in medical research were recognized by National Public Radio’s Marketplace podcast during joint exercise Arctic Edge 2024. When NPR travelled to NHRC to record a special episode on the challenges warfighters face operating in the extreme cold, Jones and Dunn were able to relay to a general audience their scientific efforts to improve service members’ readiness, resilience, and lethality.

Team Awards in Outstanding Research Accomplishment

Three teams were awarded for their outstanding research contributions supporting the warfighter with significant accomplishment of high impact achieved since February 2024.

The Linking Investigations in Trauma and Emergency Services Network team from the University of Pittsburgh, led by Dr. Jason Sperry, section chief of trauma surgery, University of Pittsburgh Medical Center Division of Surgery, was honored in the research category, “Blood and Blood Products: Novel Strategies for Treatment of Blood Failure.”

The LITES Network completed two high-impact trials—CriSP-HS and CriSP-TBI—demonstrating the feasibility, efficacy, and safety of early, cold-stored platelet transfusion in patients with hemorrhagic shock and TBI. These trials provided the first high-level evidence supporting early CSP use in injured patients. LITES demonstrated CSP transfusions were safe, could be provided earlier, and may improve outcomes. Incorporating CSPs into military transfusion protocols has the potential to augment the platelet supply, expand access to operationally complex environments, and improve outcomes in the critically injured warfighter.

The Naval Psychological Readiness and Human Performance team from the Naval Submarine Medical Research Laboratory, led by Justin Handy, who has a doctorate in cognitive psychology, research psychologist, Naval Submarine Medical Research Laboratory, and Dominica Hernandez, Ph.D. team co-lead, research psychologist, principal investigator, was honored in the research category, “Undersea Operational Research Panel.”

The NPRHP team transitioned multiple evidence-based fleet deliverables that improved submariner and nuclear-operator screening, career prediction, and individual coaching to foster readiness, professional development, leadership, team performance, and retention. The team validated a model for predicting optimal career outcomes and targeting optimal points for career intervention. Their submarine leadership and sailor development programs transitioned to the fleet, becoming mandated for submariners assigned to operational boats. Their efforts also formed the basis for a U.S. Navy-wide leadership assessment and development program.

The interdisciplinary team comprised of Dr. Francisco Vital-Lopez, with the Henry M. Jackson Foundation for the Advancement of Military Medicine in support of the DOD Biotechnology High Performance Computing Software Applications Institute, and Jaques Reifman, who has a doctorate in nuclear engineering, director and senior research scientist of the Biotechnology High-Performance Computing Software Applications Institute, U.S. Army Medical Research and Development Command, was honored in the research category, “Big Data, AI and Machine Learning in Military Research: Precision Medicine and Operational Readiness.”

Reifman led the team in developing and clearing with the Food and Drug Administration the APPRAISE-Hemorrhage Risk Index application, an artificial intelligence-enabled decision-support system designed to help combat medics triage trauma casualties for hemorrhage risk near the point of injury. The FDA clearance was a major milestone allowing for wide use and dissemination of this critical capability that will improve the chances of survival of combat casualties. APPRAISE-HRI is a one-of-a-kind application and the first and only AI-enabled software as a medical device approved by the FDA from the DOD.

Team Awards in Outstanding Program Management

Three teams were honored for outstanding medical product program management. The award focused on the accomplishments of a team charged with further maturing medical research and development or a commercial effort.

The Freeze-Dried Plasma Integrated Product Team from the Warfighter Protection and Acute Care, Operational Medical Systems, and industry partner Octapharma, led by Andrew Atkinson, product manager, OPMED, WPAC, and Kendra Lawrence, Ph.D., project manager OPMED, WPAC, was honored in the research category, “Advances in Far-Forward (Roles 1/2) Clinical Care Provision.”

Using a combination of traditional and innovative product development strategies together with an unprecedented level of collaboration, the FDP Integrated Product Team and industry partner Octapharma achieved an emergency use authorization for OctaPlasLG Powder in August 2024. This delivered the first ability for conventional forces to stock and field FDA-authorized FDP and demonstrates significant achievement in product development through the team’s depth of expertise, flexibility in acquisition and regulatory strategies, and unwavering commitment to find solutions to priority medical gaps.

The U.S. Army Office of Regulated Activities Medical Devices and Diagnostics branch, in partnership with military medical product developers across DOD, led by Dr. Chandar Thakur, chief of ORA, was recognized in the category, “State of the Technology: Demonstrations of Acute Diagnostic and Monitoring TBI Devices.”

MDD played a crucial role in achieving five FDA approvals of military-focused medical products since February 2024. Efforts included the Automated Processing of the Physiologic Registry for Assessment of Injury Severity, Analyzer-Traumatic Brain Injury, MEQU Fluid Warmer, Infrascanner 2500, and SymVess. MDD also addressed several program-impacting issues with FDA, leading to successful milestones.

The Joint Program Executive Office for Chemical, Biological, Radiological, and Nuclear Medical team, led by U.S. Army Col. Matthew Clark, joint project manager for Chemical, Biological, Radiological, and Nuclear Medical, was recognized in the category, “Enhancing Military Medical Readiness through Global Health Engagement and Research.”

The JPM CBRN Medical team is recognized for excellence in support of their efforts increasing warfighter readiness and reducing operational risk from chemical agents. They have received seven FDA-approved products; four this year alone. Much of the recent success of the JPM CBRN Medical can be attributed to the “Year of the Integrated Product Team (IPT)” initiative the team kicked off in 2023, and its strong focus on an integrated master schedule and schedule management. The Year of the IPT highlighted that quality is essential for success.

March 27, 2020

Untangling the relationship between traumatic brain injury (TBI and posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is a complex challenge. Service members can experience both a mild TBI (also known as concussion) and psychological distress from combat situations, assaults and motor vehicle crashes. But research from the Defense and Veterans Brain Injury Center (DVBIC), a division of the Defense Health Agency Research and Development Directorate, has found that psychological experiences prior to TBI may play a role in recovery.

In a 2018 study from DVBIC's San Antonio site, we identified 165 service members with concussion, some of whom also had a diagnosis of PTSD. Drawing on data from our Prospective Traumatic Brain Injury Clinical Tracking Repository, we were able to collect information on life experiences and mental health prior to joining the military. We considered variables such as resilience and past trauma. The data showed that resilience, or ""positive attitudes,"" were inversely associated with whether an individual reported symptoms from concussion and traumatic stress.

Interestingly, data from the same study revealed that how one copes with adversity, or the number of traumatic experiences, can impact symptoms reported from concussion. So that those who have experienced more adversity in life, such as really bad accidents, seeing someone hurt or die, or some other sudden event that was scary or horrific, reported greater concussion symptoms. This effect was independent from the effect of resilience.

Social support is also an important factor. In a survey of 326 service members with concussion, we found that the presence of regular social relationships – for example, consistent weekly interactions with friends and family – appeared to protect service members from concussion symptoms.

These findings contain important insights that may help military health care providers understand and treat service members with a history of concussion. Screening for prior trauma may help to identify those at greater risk of developing persistent post-concussion symptoms. Intervention that promotes resilience and social support may be an important part of a comprehensive intervention plan for those with a history of TBI.

Dr. Kennedy is the senior clinical research director, Dr. Lu is a research director and Dr. Reid is a research scientist for DVBIC. They work as contractors with General Dynamics Information Technology, for the DVBIC site at the San Antonio Military Medical Center, Ft. Sam Houston, Texas. Drs. Kennedy and Lu have doctorates in clinical psychology and conduct neuropsychological evaluations with service members at Brooke Army Medical Center, while Dr. Reid is a neuroscientist, heading research efforts focused on epigenetic and behavioral changes associated with TBI and PTSD.

Veterans Affairs, which provides health coverage for veterans and their dependents, did not include abortion in its coverage until 2022.
President Joe Biden's administration added it months after the U.S. Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade and state abortion bans began kicking in.
The VA says in its proposal that allowing abortion is legally questionable because Congress has not specifically allowed it.
The conservative law firm Alliance Defending Freedom called on the VA to drop abortion coverage in a letter last month, saying the cost or providing abortion takes other health resources away from veterans.","President Donald Trump's administration is calling to remove abortion coverage from the list of medical benefits for veterans and their families, saying it's not needed.

The Department of Veterans Affairs posted the proposed rule change on Monday and opened a public comment period on it that runs through Sept. 3. The department said in its proposal that it wants to ensure it “provides only needed medical services to our nation’s heroes and their families.”

The department says it would still provide abortion in life-threatening circumstances – something state laws allow, even in places where bans are in place. But critics of the change note that abortion would not be provided when pregnancies are the result of rape or incest.

Amy Friedrich-Karnik, director of federal policy at the Guttmacher Institute, said in a statement that the change would cut off millions of veterans and their families from services.

“Veterans have historically faced significant barriers to reproductive health care, and with the current patchwork of abortion bans and restrictions across the country, these barriers are even steeper today,"" she said.

Veterans Affairs, which provides health coverage for veterans and their dependents, did not include abortion in its coverage until 2022. President Joe Biden's administration added it months after the U.S. Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade and state abortion bans began kicking in.

The Biden changed allowed the VA to provide abortion even in states where it was banned. The VA says in its proposal that allowing abortion is legally questionable because Congress has not specifically allowed it. The policy change would also bring the VA's coverage into line with other federal health care plans – including Medicaid and the TriCare coverage for active military members and their families – which exclude abortion in most cases.

The VA said in its filings that about 100 veterans and 40 dependents obtain abortions using the benefits each year – far below the projection the department made in 2022 of a total of 1,000 a year.

This extension has tripled virtual visits and achieved high satisfaction among providers and patients, marking a significant milestone in the company’s government business.

Significant Software Revenue Growth

American Well Corporation reported a remarkable 47% year-over-year growth in software revenue. This growth was driven by strategic client deployments and milestones, highlighting the company’s successful efforts in expanding its software offerings and client base.

Improved Adjusted EBITDA

The company achieved a significant improvement in adjusted EBITDA, moving from a negative $35 million in Q2 of last year to a negative $4.7 million. This marks the fifth consecutive quarter of improvement, showcasing the company’s effective cost management and operational efficiency.

Cost Reduction Initiatives

American Well Corporation made substantial progress towards a leaner cost structure by reducing R&D expenses by approximately 12.2% and sales and marketing expenses by 32% compared to last year’s second quarter. These initiatives reflect the company’s focus on optimizing its operations and improving financial performance.

Reduction in Behavioral Health and Automated Care Programs

The 2026 contract extension for the Military Health System excluded behavioral health and automated care programs due to budget restrictions. This exclusion has impacted the company’s revised guidance, highlighting the challenges faced in aligning with budgetary constraints.

Decrease in Visit Metrics

The company completed approximately 1.2 million visits in Q2, which is about 22.3% lower than a year ago. Additionally, AMG visit revenue was 20.8% lower than last year, indicating a decline in visit metrics that the company needs to address moving forward.

Revised Revenue Guidance

American Well Corporation revised its 2025 revenue guidance to a range of $245 million to $250 million, down from the prior range of $250 million to $260 million. This revision reflects new expectations around contributions from the government business, particularly the extension of the Military Health System contract.

Forward-Looking Guidance

During the earnings call, American Well Corporation provided updated guidance with a focus on achieving positive cash flow from operations by 2026. The company reported a total revenue of $70.9 million for Q2, a 13% increase year-over-year. Subscription software revenue grew by 47%, reaching $40.4 million and comprising 57% of total revenue. The company anticipates full-year revenue for 2025 to be between $245 million and $250 million, with subscription software revenue expected to represent 53% of total revenues. They project adjusted EBITDA to range from negative $50 million to negative $45 million, demonstrating a 65% improvement year-over-year.

In summary, American Well Corporation’s earnings call reflected a balanced sentiment with both achievements and challenges. The company’s strategic wins, particularly with Florida Blue and the Military Health System, highlight its growth potential. However, challenges such as reduced visit metrics and revised revenue guidance underscore the need for continued focus on cost management and strategic partnerships. Overall, the company’s efforts in improving software revenue and EBITDA suggest a cautiously optimistic outlook for the future.",https://blog.tipranks.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/shutterstock_2127549605-750x406.jpg,N,0.0,2025-08-06 22:56:18.010480

Guido Valdes, director of Defense Health Network Pacific Rim, hosted Patrick Picardo, executive director of the Office of VA/DoD Health Affairs, Veterans Health Administration, July 10 to discuss implementation of a DOD and VA initiative to expand healthcare collaboration. Two of DHN-PR’s military hospitals and clinics, Naval Medical Center San Diego and Naval Hospital Camp Pendleton, have been designated jointly as one of five initial shared sites nationwide.

The two hospitals are participating as a single shared site due to their geographic proximity. They are also close to the San Diego VA Healthcare System’s medical center, which is approximately 15 miles from NMCSD and 41 miles from NHCP. The initiative will focus on enhancing readiness skills for DoD medical professionals, expanding access to care for TRICARE beneficiaries and veterans, and reducing network costs. It will achieve these goals by leveraging shared clinical workload capacity, aligning operational capabilities, and improving care coordination between these military hospitals and VA San Diego.

“Our mission is grounded in integration—between the Defense Health Agency and Navy Medicine, and now increasingly with the VA,” said Valdes, who is also the Naval Medical Forces Pacific commander. “By working together, we can expand access to care through resource sharing, promote readiness, and reduce reliance on external medical systems while maintaining the highest standards of care.”

The meeting reflected ongoing DOD-VA resource sharing to more efficiently use taxpayer resources and provide timely, coordinated care to eligible beneficiaries.

The discussion overviewed the network's capabilities, which span nine military hospitals and clinics across the Pacific Rim. Leaders at both NMCSD and NHCP met with Picardo and his team July 9 to develop familiarity with the facilities and their scope of operations.

""It was a privilege to host Mr. Patrick Picardo and his team at Naval Medical Center San Diego,"" said NMCSD Acting Director Capt. Laurie Chavez. ""Our discussions reinforced a shared commitment to expanding access to high-quality care for our nation's veterans. Whether it's improving base access, optimizing operating room capacity, or aligning with VA partners, NMCSD remains steadfast in our dedication to delivering world-class medical support to those who have served.""

Picardo talked about the value of partnerships to break down barriers and build bridges between the two organizations while also emphasizing how future collaborations will enhance existing relationships between military hospitals and clinics and VA hospitals.

The visit also emphasized the importance of leader-to-leader communication at all levels—local, regional, and national—to maintain alignment and drive progress.

“As we expand these initiatives, it’s critical we stay connected—from the facility level up to the department level,” Valdes said. “That’s how we ensure we are collaborating strategically and making these partnerships work.”

Defense Health Network Pacific Rim (DHN-PR) is one of the Defense Health Agency’s nine networks of hospitals and clinics that deliver high-quality health care to more than 140,000 enrolled beneficiaries, supporting major operational units through the Indo-Pacific.

Amwell's revenue has declined 3.4% over the past year, with an operating margin of -66.08% and net margin of -59.14%. The company's valuation metrics suggest potential undervaluation, with a price-to-sales and price-to-book ratio close to their one-year lows.

Amwell, a leading technology-enabled healthcare platform provider, has secured a one-year extension of its Digital First contract through a partnership led by Leidos. This agreement supports the ongoing digital transformation of the Military Health System (MHS), allowing Amwell to continue supplying its technology platform for virtual care [1].

The extended contract enables Amwell to maintain its virtual care platform for MHS providers, which has been successfully implemented across the Department of Defense’s global operations, including the US Military Entrance Processing Command and US Coast Guard. The platform integrates seamlessly with the MHS electronic health record, supporting adaptable healthcare solutions for military personnel, their families, and care teams [1].

Amwell's platform has been instrumental in streamlining care team workloads, enhancing beneficiary health, reducing costs, and improving the use of the Defense Health Agency’s clinical resources worldwide. Through the DHA’s Digital Front Door initiative, new features have been added to MHS GENESIS, a sophisticated electronic health record system for military and Veteran healthcare. Amwell’s platform supports effective, high-quality care delivery within existing clinical workflows, including those in MHS GENESIS, enabling the DHA to adopt hybrid care models [1].

The Digital First program supports approximately 9.6 million users, including active-duty service members, their families, retirees, and healthcare professionals across all levels of care. Amwell chairman and CEO Ido Schoenberg stated, ""Our platform is in use across the global DOD enterprise, enabling high-quality, efficient care for this important population. We are grateful for the service of our nation’s military, and we are proud to be supporting their wellbeing"" [1].

Financial Performance and Valuation

Despite the contract extension, Amwell has experienced a decline in revenue over the past year, with a 3.4% decrease. The company reported an operating margin of -66.08% and a net margin of -59.14%. However, the company's valuation metrics suggest potential undervaluation, with price-to-sales and price-to-book ratios close to their one-year lows [2].

Amwell's Q2 2025 earnings call highlighted several key points. The company reported a 47% year-over-year increase in Q2 subscription software revenue, with a gross margin of 56.1% and a significant narrowing of adjusted EBITDA loss. Cash burn declined to $3 million, with $219 million in cash on hand. The company also secured a strategic partnership with Florida Blue, expanding its payer market footprint [2].

However, the contract extension excludes AmWell’s behavioral health and automated care programs due to Department of Defense budget caps, prompting a downward revision in 2025 subscription revenue guidance. The company lowered its full-year 2025 revenue guidance to $245–$250 million from $250–$260 million and narrowed adjusted EBITDA to a negative $50 million to $45 million [2].

Conclusion

Amwell's contract extension with the Military Health System demonstrates the company's commitment to providing high-quality, efficient virtual care solutions. Despite financial challenges, the company's strategic partnerships and operational progress indicate potential growth opportunities. Investors should closely monitor Amwell's financial performance and strategic initiatives to assess its long-term prospects.

Carnegie, Samantha Hawkins",,,,,https://www.mintz.com/insights-center/viewpoints/2146/2025-08-06-federal-court-blocks-arkansas-pbm-ownership-law-citing,"In a significant legal development, a federal judge has temporarily blocked Arkansas from enforcing Act 624.
These existing laws, Judge Miller noted, are sufficient to address the state’s stated concerns without imposing the sweeping restrictions of Act 624.
“Subjecting TRICARE to the Arkansas Act 624 license requirements would give the State’s pharmacy board a virtual power of review over .
He also declined to find preemption under ERISA or Medicare, noting that Act 624 regulates pharmacy licensing rather than plan administration.
If upheld, Act 624 could serve as a model for other states seeking to rein in PBM influence.","In a significant legal development, a federal judge has temporarily blocked Arkansas from enforcing Act 624. Act 624 prohibits pharmacy benefit managers (PBMs) from owning or operating pharmacies in the state, effectively forcing vertically integrated companies to divest or shut down their Arkansas pharmacy operations. However, on July 28, 2025, U.S. District Judge Brian Miller granted a preliminary injunction to several major PBMs and affiliated entities, halting the law’s implementation pending final resolution of the case.

Court Finds Violation of Commerce Clause and TRICARE Preemption

In his order, Judge Miller concluded that Act 624 likely violates the U.S. Constitution’s Commerce Clause by overtly discriminating against out-of-state companies and imposes an excessive burden on interstate commerce. The statute’s preamble explicitly states its purpose is to eliminate “business tactics that have driven locally-operated pharmacies out of business,” which the court interpreted as protectionist rhetoric targeting non-Arkansas entities.

“Although the state argues that it is merely targeting a form of business structure, this appears to only be a half-truth,” Judge Miller wrote. “The statute discloses that the state is also attempting to protect ‘locally operated pharmacies’ as opposed to just consumers and non-PBM affiliated pharmacies, including out-of-state non-PBM affiliated pharmacies like Walgreens.”

The judge emphasized that Arkansas already has several laws regulating PBMs, including statutes that prohibit discriminatory reimbursement practices and exclusion of willing pharmacies from health networks. These existing laws, Judge Miller noted, are sufficient to address the state’s stated concerns without imposing the sweeping restrictions of Act 624.

In addition to the Commerce Clause violation, the court found that Act 624 is likely preempted by TRICARE, the federal health benefits program for military personnel and retirees. The law would interfere with the U.S. Department of Defense’s ability to contract with PBM-owned pharmacies, undermining the uniformity and stability of the TRICARE network.

“Subjecting TRICARE to the Arkansas Act 624 license requirements would give the State’s pharmacy board a virtual power of review over . . . who the Department of Defense can contract with,” and “. . . impede[] the TRICARE program’s ability to accomplish the purposes for which Congress enacted it,” Judge Miller wrote..

Broader Constitutional Claims Rejected

While the court granted the injunction based on the Commerce Clause and TRICARE preemption, it rejected the plaintiffs’ other constitutional claims. Judge Miller found that Act 624 does not violate the Privileges and Immunities Clause, the Takings Clause, or the Equal Protection Clause. He also declined to find preemption under ERISA or Medicare, noting that Act 624 regulates pharmacy licensing rather than plan administration.

Furthermore, the court dismissed the argument that Act 624 constitutes a bill of attainder, concluding that the law does not specifically target the plaintiffs and does not impose punishment in a constitutional sense. “While Act 624 is tainted by its protectionist rhetoric so much as to render it unconstitutional under the Commerce Clause, it was not enacted in a wholly arbitrary manner,” Judge Miller wrote.

Irreparable Harm and Public Interest Support Injunction

As outlined in our June 2025 blog post, the plaintiff PBMs and other organizations argued that Act 624 would disrupt access to medications for tens of thousands of Arkansans, including TRICARE beneficiaries, seniors, and patients with complex conditions. The court found that the plaintiffs would suffer irreparable harm if the law were allowed to take effect, citing the threat of unrecoverable economic losses and the inability to seek damages due to the government’s sovereign immunity. The balance of equities and public interest also favored the plaintiffs, as “no harm is caused when defendants are enjoined from enforcing an unconstitutional law.”

Next Steps and Broader Implications

The legal battle over Act 624 is far from over. On July 31, 2025, the Arkansas State Board of Pharmacy filed a notice of appeal. The litigation, now consolidated under Express Scripts Inc. et al. v. Richmond et al., Case No. 4:25-cv-00520, will continue in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Arkansas.

The case is being closely watched nationwide, as Arkansas is the first state to enact such a sweeping restriction on PBMs’ ownership of pharmacies. If upheld, Act 624 could serve as a model for other states seeking to rein in PBM influence. Conversely, a final ruling against the law could reinforce federal protections for PBMs and affiliated pharmacies.

For now, the preliminary injunction preserves the status quo, allowing PBM-affiliated pharmacies to continue operating in Arkansas while the legal battle unfolds.",https://www.mintz.com/sites/default/files/media/images/2020-02-14/Health-Care_Small_Viewpoints.png,N,0.0,2025-08-06 17:56:09.013043

Dr. Stephen Ferrara, acting assistant secretary of defense for health affairs, presented the awards to the winning individuals and teams. Their research spanned diverse topics, including warfighter readiness, traumatic brain injury, PTSD, and mental health.

Individual Distinguished Service Award Winners

Two researchers in the military medical community were recognized for significant contributions to the success of Military Health System medical studies supporting the deployed warfighter.

In the research category, “Innovation and Current Directions in Military Suicide Prevention, Research, and Programs,” Retired U.S. Air Force Col. (Dr.) Robert Ursano, director of the Center for the Study of Traumatic Stress and professor of psychiatry and neuroscience at the Uniformed Services University, was honored for advancing mental health care, resilience, and trauma research in support of the health and well-being of warfighters.

Ursano’s key research included combat stress, posttraumatic stress disorder, and traumatic brain injury, with a focus in suicide prevention. The findings from his work provided essential data informing suicide prevention efforts and the understanding of risk and resilience in service members. The PTSD Brain Bank provides a lasting resource for future research aimed at developing better treatments. Through his leadership of CSTS, he oversaw the development and dissemination of training and intervention programs aimed at improving the psychological health of service members and families exposed to trauma and disaster.

In the research category, “Optimizing the Human Weapon System: Utilizing Wearable Sensor Data to Inform Readiness,” Dr. Karl Friedl, senior research scientist of performance physiology, U.S. Army Research Institute of Environmental Medicine, was recognized as a leader in service member health and performance. Friedl's research focused on extending limits of human physiological performance, with contributions including endocrine regulation in semi-starvation, physiological effects of anabolic steroids, body composition methods and standards, physiological monitoring, and metrics of research.

Outstanding Research Accomplishment

Individual awards were given to three researchers for outstanding research contributions supporting the warfighter with significant accomplishments of high impact achieved since February 2024.

Justin Baker, who has a doctorate in psychology, assistant professor of psychiatry and behavioral health, Ohio State University College of Medicine, was recognized for his work in the category, “Innovation and Current Directions in Military Suicide Prevention, Research, and Programs.”

Baker's work focused on increasing the reach and accessibility of suicide prevention treatments through research that advances group therapy, telehealth, virtual learning platforms, and other innovative resources for service members struggling with suicidal thoughts and behaviors. His accomplishments stem from leading successful military-academic partnerships to help warfighters return to operational readiness and build resilience skills.

Mary Jo Pugh, a retired U.S. Air Force nurse who has a doctorate in psychology, and professor, Division of Epidemiology at the University of Utah School of Medicine, was recognized for her work in the category, “Evolving Methods for the Analysis of Large Complex Data Sources to Inform Military Health Policy, Readiness, Performance and Medical Practices.” She is also an investigator at the Informatics, Decision-Enhancement and Analytic Sciences Center of Innovation and the Department of Veterans Affairs Salt Lake City.

Pugh made groundbreaking contributions to research on TBI on multiple morbidity in veterans. She pioneered the integration of Department of Defense and VA data, revolutionizing the study of military exposures and complex comorbidities. Her leadership in the LIMBIC Phenotype study, encompassing over 2.5 million post-9/11 veterans, unveiled critical insights into TBI phenotypes and their associated outcomes. Pugh's innovative application of complexity theory and her dedication to advancing research methodologies significantly enhanced understanding of deployed warfighter and veteran health.

U.S. Army Capt. (Dr.) Maya Alexandri, J.D., U.S. Army Medical Corp, was recognized in the category, “Portable Medical & Dental Imaging in the Far Forward Environment.”

Alexandri led groundbreaking research measuring the electromagnetic signature of handheld ultrasound systems, otherwise known as EMS and HUS, as a crucial step for ensuring safe use in austere, high-risk combat environments. Her pilot study, conducted with the DOD’s Joint Electromagnetic Warfare Center, found that the EMS of HUS probes is negligible—undetectable at distances beyond 10 feet—suggesting they likely can be safely used without risking adversary detection. This first-of-its-kind research lays the foundation for U.S. Army doctrine integrating HUS into far-forward military medical care.

Warfighter Medical Research Public Communication

Doug Jones, who has a doctorate in movement and sport sciences, research physiologist, and director for the Warfighter Performance Department’s Thermal Physiology Lab, Naval Health Research Center, and team member, Dr. Timothy Dunn, who has a doctorate in cognitive psychology, cognitive scientist, Warfighter Performance Department, were recognized for contributions to broadening the general public's awareness of DOD-sponsored warfighter-related medical research through public communications in the category, “Polar Performance at Altitude and Arctic Activities.”

Jones and Dunn significantly advanced understanding of warfighters’ physiological and cognitive responses to operating in extreme environments. Their dedication and scientific rigor in medical research were recognized by National Public Radio’s Marketplace podcast during joint exercise Arctic Edge 2024. When NPR travelled to NHRC to record a special episode on the challenges warfighters face operating in the extreme cold, Jones and Dunn were able to relay to a general audience their scientific efforts to improve service members’ readiness, resilience, and lethality.

Team Awards in Outstanding Research Accomplishment

Three teams were awarded for their outstanding research contributions supporting the warfighter with significant accomplishment of high impact achieved since February 2024.

The Linking Investigations in Trauma and Emergency Services Network team from the University of Pittsburgh, led by Dr. Jason Sperry, section chief of trauma surgery, University of Pittsburgh Medical Center Division of Surgery, was honored in the research category, “Blood and Blood Products: Novel Strategies for Treatment of Blood Failure.”

The LITES Network completed two high-impact trials—CriSP-HS and CriSP-TBI—demonstrating the feasibility, efficacy, and safety of early, cold-stored platelet transfusion in patients with hemorrhagic shock and TBI. These trials provided the first high-level evidence supporting early CSP use in injured patients. LITES demonstrated CSP transfusions were safe, could be provided earlier, and may improve outcomes. Incorporating CSPs into military transfusion protocols has the potential to augment the platelet supply, expand access to operationally complex environments, and improve outcomes in the critically injured warfighter.

The Naval Psychological Readiness and Human Performance team from the Naval Submarine Medical Research Laboratory, led by Justin Handy, who has a doctorate in cognitive psychology, research psychologist, Naval Submarine Medical Research Laboratory, and Dominica Hernandez, Ph.D. team co-lead, research psychologist, principal investigator, was honored in the research category, “Undersea Operational Research Panel.”

The NPRHP team transitioned multiple evidence-based fleet deliverables that improved submariner and nuclear-operator screening, career prediction, and individual coaching to foster readiness, professional development, leadership, team performance, and retention. The team validated a model for predicting optimal career outcomes and targeting optimal points for career intervention. Their submarine leadership and sailor development programs transitioned to the fleet, becoming mandated for submariners assigned to operational boats. Their efforts also formed the basis for a U.S. Navy-wide leadership assessment and development program.

The interdisciplinary team comprised of Dr. Francisco Vital-Lopez, with the Henry M. Jackson Foundation for the Advancement of Military Medicine in support of the DOD Biotechnology High Performance Computing Software Applications Institute, and Jaques Reifman, who has a doctorate in nuclear engineering, director and senior research scientist of the Biotechnology High-Performance Computing Software Applications Institute, U.S. Army Medical Research and Development Command, was honored in the research category, “Big Data, AI and Machine Learning in Military Research: Precision Medicine and Operational Readiness.”

Reifman led the team in developing and clearing with the Food and Drug Administration the APPRAISE-Hemorrhage Risk Index application, an artificial intelligence-enabled decision-support system designed to help combat medics triage trauma casualties for hemorrhage risk near the point of injury. The FDA clearance was a major milestone allowing for wide use and dissemination of this critical capability that will improve the chances of survival of combat casualties. APPRAISE-HRI is a one-of-a-kind application and the first and only AI-enabled software as a medical device approved by the FDA from the DOD.

Team Awards in Outstanding Program Management

Three teams were honored for outstanding medical product program management. The award focused on the accomplishments of a team charged with further maturing medical research and development or a commercial effort.

The Freeze-Dried Plasma Integrated Product Team from the Warfighter Protection and Acute Care, Operational Medical Systems, and industry partner Octapharma, led by Andrew Atkinson, product manager, OPMED, WPAC, and Kendra Lawrence, Ph.D., project manager OPMED, WPAC, was honored in the research category, “Advances in Far-Forward (Roles 1/2) Clinical Care Provision.”

Using a combination of traditional and innovative product development strategies together with an unprecedented level of collaboration, the FDP Integrated Product Team and industry partner Octapharma achieved an emergency use authorization for OctaPlasLG Powder in August 2024. This delivered the first ability for conventional forces to stock and field FDA-authorized FDP and demonstrates significant achievement in product development through the team’s depth of expertise, flexibility in acquisition and regulatory strategies, and unwavering commitment to find solutions to priority medical gaps.

The U.S. Army Office of Regulated Activities Medical Devices and Diagnostics branch, in partnership with military medical product developers across DOD, led by Dr. Chandar Thakur, chief of ORA, was recognized in the category, “State of the Technology: Demonstrations of Acute Diagnostic and Monitoring TBI Devices.”

MDD played a crucial role in achieving five FDA approvals of military-focused medical products since February 2024. Efforts included the Automated Processing of the Physiologic Registry for Assessment of Injury Severity, Analyzer-Traumatic Brain Injury, MEQU Fluid Warmer, Infrascanner 2500, and SymVess. MDD also addressed several program-impacting issues with FDA, leading to successful milestones.

The Joint Program Executive Office for Chemical, Biological, Radiological, and Nuclear Medical team, led by U.S. Army Col. Matthew Clark, joint project manager for Chemical, Biological, Radiological, and Nuclear Medical, was recognized in the category, “Enhancing Military Medical Readiness through Global Health Engagement and Research.”

The JPM CBRN Medical team is recognized for excellence in support of their efforts increasing warfighter readiness and reducing operational risk from chemical agents. They have received seven FDA-approved products; four this year alone. Much of the recent success of the JPM CBRN Medical can be attributed to the “Year of the Integrated Product Team (IPT)” initiative the team kicked off in 2023, and its strong focus on an integrated master schedule and schedule management. The Year of the IPT highlighted that quality is essential for success.

Several other awards will be presented during the week-long symposium. The Young Investigator Competition will be held during the conference to honor three top investigators. More than 1,400 scientific posters will be presented during MHSRS, and top poster presenters will be recognized by their peers.

Ryan wrote a letter to Defense Health Agency Acting Director David Smith, demanding that the Keller inpatient unit remain open.
Ryan said he is demanding better for the Hudson Valley military community.
Keller Army Community Hospital provides a range of health care services for the cadets and military personnel stationed at West Point, including inpatient and surgical care.
Additionally, West Point has 30 NCAA sports teams whose athletes receive treatment at Keller.","Congressman Pat Ryan has raised the alarm on the Trump Administration’s plan to “downsize” 17 Military Treatment Facilities across the country, including Keller Army Community Hospital at the U.S. Military Academy at West Point. The plan would downgrade Keller from a community hospital where patients can receive high-quality inpatient treatment into what is effectively an urgent care – stripping critical medical care away from West Point cadets, servicemembers, retirees, and their families. Patients will no longer be able to receive treatment and observation overnight, instead being forced to seek care at already-overloaded private facilities.

Ryan wrote a letter to Defense Health Agency Acting Director David Smith, demanding that the Keller inpatient unit remain open. Especially as he continues his fight to reopen 20 inpatient beds at Castle Point VA, which closed amid Trump’s hiring freeze. Ryan said he is demanding better for the Hudson Valley military community.

Keller Army Community Hospital provides a range of health care services for the cadets and military personnel stationed at West Point, including inpatient and surgical care. “Downsizing” the facility, Ryan said, will force West Point patients to seek inpatient care off-post at private facilities, running the risk that they will experience significantly increased wait times and a lower quality of care. It also terminates Keller’s ability to provide hospital care – which has alarming implications for patients in emergency situations. Not only does this add an extra burden to patients in emergency situations, it would divert significant resources from cadets and instructors who would then be responsible for transporting patients.

Ryan added that the proposal comes at a time when the health care system in the Hudson Valley is already significantly strained and struggling to provide care to the civilian population. It also comes following years of reductions in services at Keller, including the loss of labor and delivery, pediatric, podiatric, and ear, nose and throat care. “Past decisions to cut services and systemic underfunding have led to a downward cycle that has significantly diminished care at Keller,” he said.

Further, the congressman said, closing Keller’s inpatient unit has potentially degrading effects on West Point’s capability to recruit talent. Everything done at USMA impacts the readiness of the Army, so having access to 24/7 specialized care is crucial. Additionally, West Point has 30 NCAA sports teams whose athletes receive treatment at Keller. Without the inpatient unit, in particular the orthopedic capabilities, cadets will have to travel at least 40 minutes to the next closest facility.",https://timescommunitypapers.tbenson.communityq.com/images/nameplates/hvt.png,N,0.0,2025-08-06 17:56:24.153809

Thirty-eight percent of young Black women have earned a college degree, but most borrow a significant amount in student loans.","By Shalise Manza Young

Raise your hand if the following sentence surprises you:

As the Trump regime’s seeming resegregation of the federal workforce continues and the reality of the thousands of jobs summarily eliminated by DOGE becomes clear, it is Black women who have been the most negatively impacted.

Scanning the room, I see no hands raised. Good on you for understanding this country’s centuries of mistreatment of Black women.

Since our national nightmare began anew on Jan. 20, there have been shameless dismissals of Black women in higher-level government roles: Carla Hayden, the first Black person to run the Library of Congress; Gwynne Wilcox, the first Black woman on the National Labor Relations Board; Lt. Gen. Telita Crosland, head of the military’s Defense Health Agency, who retired “abruptly”; and Charlotte A. Burrows, chair of the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission. All illustrate that to President Donald Trump and his miscreant minions, apparently only white is right when it comes to leadership roles.

Government data show that in just three months, February to April, 318,000 Black women left the U.S. labor force. The number might be higher now because more dismissals have occurred in the months since.

Though many bureaus have seen some reduction in staff, major slashes have come at the departments of Education, Health and Human Services, Housing and Urban Development, and Veterans Affairs; at each, the percentage of Black employees was 20% or higher.

Gender economist Katica Roy believes it’s not an accident.

With the reductions, “you’re not just trimming the fat, you’re actually cutting the economic backbone for Black women,” Roy said in a recent ABC News interview. “When we often think about women’s issues or Black women’s issues, we think of it as an ‘over there’ problem. It’s not—it’s an everybody problem.”

Underscoring her point, Roy noted that the drop in Black women’s workforce participation means a $37 billion loss in gross domestic product. Higher employment rates mean higher wages across the board.

Though they represent roughly 6% of the total workforce nationally, data published in 2023 shows Black women made up nearly 12% of the federal workforce before cuts began. We can’t know exactly how many of the cohort were forced out of their jobs since the Office of Personnel Management, a supposedly independent agency, scrubbed all racial demographic information from its public data website in March (probably to appease Dear Leader), but in late February Education Department union leader Sheria Smith said 60 of the 74 workers that had been let go from the department are Black.

The cuts are more than a loss of experience and efficiency. Federal employment has played a significant role in building the Black middle class.

Black veterans were essentially shut out of the post-World War II G.I. Bill that set millions of their white colleagues on a path to generational wealth, further increasing the economic divide between white and Black Americans. But the landmark 1964 Civil Rights Act prompted the government to diversify its workforce.

Crucially, civil service jobs provide stability, a chance to climb the ladder that’s not always afforded in the private sector, plus benefits and pensions. And because 25.1% of all federal employees are unionized, compared with just 6% in the private sector, there is often an extra layer of security built in. (The pay gap, however, persists: Black women in civil service are not paid at the same rate as their white woman counterparts, let alone white men.)

Long the most unprotected demographic in America, Black women were relegated to the lowest-paying jobs for generations and still make up a disproportionate share of workers in sectors like child care, retail, and hospitality, A 2019 study shows that many of those jobs will be automated by 2030. Black women have largely been locked out of tech roles and receive essentially pennies of venture capital money. With programs meant to help increase those numbers frequently facing big-money-backed lawsuits crying that it’s discriminatory to only help Black women, that might not change anytime soon.

Thirty-eight percent of young Black women have earned a college degree, but most borrow a significant amount in student loans. Add that to rising inflation because of tariffs and the price of women’s goods already costing more than men’s goods, and it’s easy to see that some might be headed for catastrophe.

Slightly more than half of Black households with children have mothers as the breadwinner, so the financial success—or failure—of Black women can have significant consequences.

“If we take a step back, this is an economic alarm bell,” Roy said.

There’s a truism that says when America gets a cold, Black people get the flu. In this case, Black women seeing alarming job losses is likely a signal that the rest of America’s workforce should start stocking up on Kleenex.

The company's adjusted EBITDA loss narrowed significantly to $(4.7 million) in Q2 2025, an 86.6% year-over-year improvement compared to Q2 2024. Gross margin expanded to 56.1% in Q2 2025, reflecting the company's focus on recurring software subscription revenue [1].

American Well's full-year revenue guidance for FY2025 was lowered to a range of $245 million to $250 million after the divestiture of Amwell Psychiatric Care, down from the previous guidance of $250 million to $260 million. The company expects adjusted EBITDA loss for FY2025 to be $(50) to $(45) million, a narrower range indicating progress on improving operating performance [1].

The company's stock price surged 20.45% in aftermarket trading following the earnings report, reaching $7.82, and has seen a year-to-date return of 16.97% [3]. Despite the strong financial performance, ongoing net losses highlight challenges in achieving profitability.

American Well continues to focus on scaling its technology, signing partnerships with large health systems and payers, and transitioning to recurring software subscription revenue. The company's success relies on maintaining regulatory compliance and interoperability with other healthcare systems.

Investors will likely remain focused on the pace of platform adoption, the outcome of government contract renewals, and continued improvement in profit metrics as American Well navigates the rapidly evolving telehealth sector.

The seminar focused on the holistic connection between mental health and limb loss or limb trauma. Speakers addressed how the mind-body connection is a tool for managing severe, chronic pain, with potential to heal and function in daily life.

“FAST always has had some element of mental health, but mental health emerged as the next clear priority topic based on an emphasis in the clinical practice guidelines and clinician input,” said Andrea Crunkhorn, the EACE chief of clinical affairs who holds a doctorate in physical therapy.

EACE, part of the DHA Research and Engineering Directorate, is advancing the science of trauma-related and patient-centered care. EACE is a joint operation of the Department of Defense and Department of Veterans Affairs.

DOD and VA have jointly published 28 clinical practice guidelines based on current best practices and the most up-to-date, evidence-based research. DOD-VA have published two limb loss clinical resources:

Rehabilitation of Lower Limb Amputation

Management of Upper Limb Amputation Rehabilitation

Functional recovery speaker captures meeting themes

Dr. Ajay Manhapra, who works at the Hampton VA Medical Center, encapsulated the mind-body connection in his presentation, “Enabling physical and psychosocial recovery among veterans with debilitating chronic pain: Can lessons learned help people with limb loss experiencing chronic pain?”

“A chronic pain syndrome diagnosis means that the pain has become a separate problem … and is not a symptom of some other physical disorder,” Manhapra said.

Manhapra is a pioneer of the care model where patients establish a “trauma narrative” to reframe their trauma and help make sense of their experience. Patients build a timeline linking their injuries with subsequent behavioral challenges, such as PTSD or opioid addiction.

With a trauma narrative, provider and patient build a goal-oriented recovery plan to develop a “new normal with good functioning, but not the prior normal without pain,” Manhapra said. Patients learn to gradually increase their physical function with their existing pain. He also advocated for limited-time use of pain management medication.

Keynotes highlight amputees’ recovery and lessons for attendees

Three military amputees were FAST keynote speakers. All were treated at Walter Reed National Military Medical Center, and discussed their experiences with their injuries. They emphasized physical rehabilitation paired with mental health care helped them feel whole and healthy again.

Retired U.S. Army Sgt. 1st Class Daniel Metzdorf lost his right leg to a roadside bomb in Iraq in January 2004. He told the audience: “If I could go back in time and talk to that 2004 me, I would ask the hospital to make my mental health care therapy the same tempo as my physical therapy.”

U.S. Marine Corps Lt. Col. Erik Melanson, a former intelligence officer in the special operations community, suffered a traumatic dislocation of his left knee and subsequent paralysis below the knee in a recreational accident. Melanson credits his physical and mental therapy as the main reason he’s been able to stay active duty. “It's not the injury itself. The greatest threat to you is going to be isolation,” he said. “If you're struggling, just find some meaning in your struggle.”

Retired U.S. Army 1st Sgt. Christopher Roseberry lost his right leg above the ankle and suffered serious back and arm fractures in a hit-and-run accident. He spent two years recovering and returned to active duty for another 12 years. He reinjured his leg in Afghanistan and had another amputation.

From training to practice

Crunkhorn said the meeting’s interactive sessions on evidence-based imagery, visualization, music, dance/movement, and creative arts therapy were beneficial because “many therapists know of these techniques but haven’t tried to implement them in clinical practice.”",https://dha.mil/-/media/Project/Images/News-Images/9197727.jpg,N,0.0,2025-08-06 13:56:25.761859

The platform is already embedded into existing clinical workflows that care teams rely on, including those within the MHS GENESIS EHR. Amwell is providing technology to enable the DHA to leverage the benefits of hybrid care, improve access to healthcare, and ultimately improve outcomes for the MHS community.

Some highlights of platform success to date include: Nearly tripling of virtual visits since replacing the DHA's MHS Video Connect capability

Recent expansion beyond DHA sites to include MHS beneficiaries in the USCG and U.S. MEPCOM

Successful virtual visits from deployed units in a combat zone connected to a military hospital in the United States

The DHA supports U.S. national security and ensures our nation's military teams are ready to deploy. Digital First supports the entire MHS community of users, which includes approximately 9.6 million active-duty service members, family members, retirees, and health professionals across the continuum of care.

The Amwell platform has deep integration assets and a simple yet powerful user experience that enables efficient and high-quality technology-enabled care delivery. The platform is already embedded into existing clinical workflows that care teams rely on, including those within the MHS GENESIS EHR. Amwell is providing technology to enable the DHA to leverage the benefits of hybrid care, improve access to healthcare, and ultimately improve outcomes for the MHS community.

Some highlights of platform success to date include:

Nearly tripling of virtual visits since replacing the DHA’s MHS Video Connect capability

Recent expansion beyond DHA sites to include MHS beneficiaries in the USCG and U.S. MEPCOM

Successful virtual visits from deployed units in a combat zone connected to a military hospital in the United States

Fuel your body Prioritize sleep: Military life can impact sleep quality.
Remember: Building resiliency is continuous, with no end state.
Resilience training courses: These resilience training courses are designed to help service members and providers.","Richard Barton, an Operation Iraqi Freedom veteran who retired from the U.S. Army in 2012, holds a doctorate in clinical social work and served as brigade behavioral health officer several times. His primary focus at Defense Health Agency-Public Health is on behavioral health and suicide prevention.

Military service demands special strength, not just physically but also mentally and emotionally. The unique demands of military life—deployments, challenging environments, frequent moves, and separation from loved ones—can impact even the toughest individuals. That's why building individual resiliency is not just valuable; it's fundamental. Resiliency isn't about being immune to stress; it's about adapting to challenges and emerging better for it. It's also about developing a strengths-based mindset practiced by applying skills and strategies to keep going when faced with adversity.

Here are some key strategies for building resiliency:

Strengthen your connections

Team Connection: Work to foster strong, supportive relationships within your unit. These bonds help create a sense of cohesion, esprit de corps, and shared experiences, which are important for successfully navigating hardship and adversity.

Connecting with others: Use active-listening skills to build healthy connections and increase self-awareness by learning new ways to manage emotions, think through problems, and face challenges or setbacks.

Seek help when needed: Help-seeking shows the ability to single out challenges you can manage and those that can best be solved by seeking help from others. It also connects us to resources and strategies we might not have known about, adding to our problem-solving duffle or sea bag. What you ignore today may cost more tomorrow. Speak up. Reach out.

Master your mind

Develop self-discipline: Self-discipline includes identifying and aiming for goals that can change the way you think, feel, and act. Goal setting involves targeting an outcome, such as increasing your level of physical fitness, working at being more positive in your thoughts or attitudes, or increasing your general sense of well-being. In the long run, self-discipline includes committing to goals that can have a positive change on your behavior, thoughts, and emotions.

Learn and practice mindfulness and stress reduction techniques. Mind-body techniques, such as tactical breathing (https://www.med.navy.mil/Portals/62/Documents/NMFA/NMCPHC/root/Documents/health-promotion-wellness/psychological-emotional-wellbeing/Combat-Tactical-Breathing.pdf), meditation, and relaxation, help manage stress, improve focus, and promote personal well-being.

Confront negative thoughts: Just as physical exercise enhances strength, confronting negative thinking develops mental strength. The more you engage in this practice, the easier it becomes to spot and counter harmful thought patterns. A helpful technique is reframing, where you learn to identify negative thoughts and think of other ways to have a more balanced outlook. For instance, instead of saying, ""I always mess up,"" you might say, ""I've made mistakes, but the lessons learned help me improve.""

Develop a growth mindset: Embrace challenges as opportunities for growth and learning. View setbacks as temporary and focus on solutions rather than just thinking about problems.

Fuel your body

Prioritize sleep: Military life can impact sleep quality. When deployed, maximize your sleep time by limiting nonessential activities and using downtime power naps to reboot. When in homeport, on base, or in garrison, set a sleep schedule that aims for 7 to 8 hours of quality sleep.

Maintain a balanced diet: When they’re available, fuel your body with colorful, nutrient-rich foods that provide sustained energy and support physical and mental health.

Engage in regular physical activity: Exercise is a powerful stress reliever and mood booster. Find routines and gear (for example, bands) that are adaptable to your environment, and work to be consistent.

Keep your focus

Reconnect with the ""why"": Remind yourself why you chose to serve and the positive impact of that choice. A sense of purpose provides resolve and resilience during challenging times.

Expand your interests: Find pastimes and/or activities—outside of your daily duties—that you enjoy and find rewarding. This will help you maintain a sense of self and avoid feelings of burnout.

Set goals: Set achievable goals for yourself, both professionally and personally. Achieving your goals, whether short- or long-term, provides feelings of accomplishment and increased self-confidence.

Remember: Building resiliency is continuous, with no end state. It takes time, effort, and commitment. By focusing on your mental, emotional, and physical well-being, you can develop the inner discipline and resilience to live a healthy military lifestyle and face the challenges it brings.

The Distinguished Service Award honors international partners, federal civilians, individuals in academia or senior U.S. active-duty military who have made career-long contributions towards the success of military medical research for the warfighter. The recognized individual has strengthened the visibility of DoD-sponsored research and has made contributions that involve improvements to overall health and well-being, injury treatment or recovery solutions for the warfighter.

Friedl has spent over 40 years on research for the soldier, with a focus on stress physiology and the limits of human performance. As the Army’s Chief Physiologist, Friedl conceives new research directions, mentors and leads new initiatives, and connects an extensive network of researchers and capabilities. In his 30 years of active-duty service in the Army, he conducted, led, and funded research, serving as the Director of Military Operational Medicine Research Program, Commander of USARIEM, and Director of Telemedicine and Advanced Technology Research Center at Fort Detrick, Maryland.

Over the course of his career, Friedl received many honors, including the IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Society with the Professional Career Achievement Award, the Parkinson's Action Network and Alzheimer's Association with the Udall and Ronald and Nancy Reagan Award and countless others including the Founder's Award from the Pennington Biomedical Research Center and the Diabetes Research Leadership Award from the Diabetes Technology Society.

While Friedl feels honored to be recognized, he notes that “research is a team effort involving many people that make it possible, from logisticians, regulatory support staff, and contract officers to the researchers, the research volunteers and many others.”

Friedl emphasized the critical importance of the whole team as well as the larger research community. “Our successes have come about from inspired exchanges and collaborations with a large network of international military medical research partners, strong academic centers with an interest in serving military research needs, our federal partners at National Institute of Health, U.S. Department of Agriculture, and NASA, and the Navy, Marine Corps, and Air Force,” he said.

For another year at MHSRS, Friedl is excited at the prospect of interacting with this intense concentration of military researchers, senior leaders, professors and industry partners. “We have so many important problems to solve and so many great brains working to create new options for the warfighter. The future is always bright!” Friedl said.

The four-day symposium is a premier opportunity for OPMED, part of the Defense Health Agency, to showcase its current capabilities for a wide array of defense, development industry, and academic stakeholders.

FHP plays a critical role in bridging medical gaps by providing investigational medical products, which are authorized for emergency use by the Food and Drug Administration, to the joint force when no FDA-approved solution is available or feasible to meet operational requirements. FHP works with combatant commands and regulatory experts across the globe to make lifesaving treatments available to warfighters when there is an urgent need.

MHSRS, which provides a venue for presenting new scientific knowledge resulting from military-unique research and development, gives FHP a chance to highlight the vital role it plays in support of operational medical units and combatant commands around the world, according to U.S. Army Col. Chuck Bane, director of FHP.

The team’s focus aligns with the broader DOD and DHA imperatives to provide real-time solutions for combatant commanders to address capability gaps in support of warfighters in remote, austere environments.

“The FHP mission is unique within the DOD, and we are the focal point of mission-enabling activity to rapidly fill urgent capability gaps in time-compressed operational environments,” said Bane, an Army veterinarian by trade. “We partner with stakeholders across the DOD and government to provide alternative solutions in extraordinary circumstances so combatant commanders can focus on their mission while having the confidence that medical countermeasures are safe, timely, and suited to the operating environment to enhance mission readiness and increase warfighter lethality.”

The seminar focused on the holistic connection between mental health and limb loss or limb trauma. Speakers addressed how the mind-body connection is a tool for managing severe, chronic pain, with potential to heal and function in daily life.

“FAST always has had some element of mental health, but mental health emerged as the next clear priority topic based on an emphasis in the clinical practice guidelines and clinician input,” said Andrea Crunkhorn, the EACE chief of clinical affairs who holds a doctorate in physical therapy.

EACE, part of the DHA Research and Engineering Directorate, is advancing the science of trauma-related and patient-centered care. EACE is a joint operation of the Department of Defense and Department of Veterans Affairs.

DOD and VA have jointly published 28 clinical practice guidelines based on current best practices and the most up-to-date, evidence-based research. DOD-VA have published two limb loss clinical resources:

• Rehabilitation of Lower Limb Amputation

• Management of Upper Limb Amputation Rehabilitation

Functional recovery speaker captures meeting themes

Dr. Ajay Manhapra, who works at the Hampton VA Medical Center, encapsulated the mind-body connection in his presentation, “Enabling physical and psychosocial recovery among veterans with debilitating chronic pain: Can lessons learned help people with limb loss experiencing chronic pain?”

“A chronic pain syndrome diagnosis means that the pain has become a separate problem … and is not a symptom of some other physical disorder,” Manhapra said.

Manhapra is a pioneer of the care model where patients establish a “trauma narrative” to reframe their trauma and help make sense of their experience. Patients build a timeline linking their injuries with subsequent behavioral challenges, such as PTSD or opioid addiction.

With a trauma narrative, provider and patient build a goal-oriented recovery plan to develop a “new normal with good functioning, but not the prior normal without pain,” Manhapra said. Patients learn to gradually increase their physical function with their existing pain. He also advocated for limited-time use of pain management medication.

Keynotes highlight amputees’ recovery and lessons for attendees

Three military amputees were FAST keynote speakers. All were treated at Walter Reed National Military Medical Center, and discussed their experiences with their injuries. They emphasized physical rehabilitation paired with mental health care helped them feel whole and healthy again.

Retired U.S. Army Sgt. 1st Class Daniel Metzdorf lost his right leg to a roadside bomb in Iraq in January 2004. He told the audience: “If I could go back in time and talk to that 2004 me, I would ask the hospital to make my mental health care therapy the same tempo as my physical therapy.”

U.S. Marine Corps Lt. Col. Erik Melanson, a former intelligence officer in the special operations community, suffered a traumatic dislocation of his left knee and subsequent paralysis below the knee in a recreational accident. Melanson credits his physical and mental therapy as the main reason he’s been able to stay active duty. “It's not the injury itself. The greatest threat to you is going to be isolation,” he said. “If you're struggling, just find some meaning in your struggle.”

Retired U.S. Army 1st Sgt. Christopher Roseberry lost his right leg above the ankle and suffered serious back and arm fractures in a hit-and-run accident. He spent two years recovering and returned to active duty for another 12 years. He reinjured his leg in Afghanistan and had another amputation.

From training to practice

Crunkhorn said the meeting’s interactive sessions on evidence-based imagery, visualization, music, dance/movement, and creative arts therapy were beneficial because “many therapists know of these techniques but haven’t tried to implement them in clinical practice.”",https://d1ldvf68ux039x.cloudfront.net/thumbs/photos/2507/9197727/1000w_q95.jpg,N,0.0,2025-08-05 15:56:17.333086

The VA, which provides health coverage for veterans and their dependents, did not include abortion in its coverage until 2022.
The Biden administration added it months after the U.S. Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade and state abortion bans began kicking in.
The policy change would also bring the VA's coverage into line with other federal healthcare plans -- including Medicaid and the TriCare coverage for active military members and their families -- which exclude abortion in most cases.
The conservative law firm Alliance Defending Freedom called on the VA to drop abortion coverage in a letter last month, saying the cost of providing abortion takes other health resources away from veterans.","The Trump administration is calling to remove abortion coverage from the list of medical benefits for veterans and their families, saying it's not needed.

The VA posted the proposed rule change on Monday and opened a public comment period on it that runs through Sept. 3. The department said in its proposal that it wants to ensure it ""provides only needed medical services to our nation's heroes and their families.""

The department says it would still provide abortion in life-threatening circumstances -- something state laws allow, even in places where bans are in place. But critics of the change note that abortion would not be provided when pregnancies are the result of rape or incest.

Amy Friedrich-Karnik, director of federal policy at the Guttmacher Institute, said in a statement that the change would cut off millions of veterans and their families from services.

""Veterans have historically faced significant barriers to reproductive healthcare, and with the current patchwork of abortion bans and restrictions across the country, these barriers are even steeper today,"" she said.

The VA, which provides health coverage for veterans and their dependents, did not include abortion in its coverage until 2022. The Biden administration added it months after the U.S. Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade and state abortion bans began kicking in.

The Biden change allowed the VA to provide abortion even in states where it was banned. The VA says in its proposal that allowing abortion is legally questionable because Congress has not specifically allowed it. The policy change would also bring the VA's coverage into line with other federal healthcare plans -- including Medicaid and the TriCare coverage for active military members and their families -- which exclude abortion in most cases.

The VA said in its filings that about 100 veterans and 40 dependents obtain abortions using the benefits each year -- far below the projection the department made in 2022 of a total of 1,000 a year.

Dr. Stephen Ferrara, acting assistant secretary of defense for health affairs, expressed his gratitude to researchers in his opening remarks, noting, “It’s a real honor to be here with so many dedicated military and civilian researchers.”

“There are few prouder legacies in military medicine than our research legacy. This audience sits atop broad shoulders, on the shoulders of giants, but you've never rested on that legacy,” said Ferrara. “On the contrary, you're challenged by it. You challenge yourselves to live up to the highest standards, the standards set by those who came before you, not only the famous names, but also the quiet heroes who toiled and innovated anonymously for mission, for country, but most of all for their patient.”

Touching on the conference’s theme, “Supporting the Deployed Warfighter through Military Medical Research,” Ferrara said, “When I talk about the 3 ‘S’s’ that comprise our mission—supporting our warfighter, sustaining our clinical skills, and strengthening our chain—your work exemplifies these priorities.”

Ferrara addressed the challenges facing military medicine brought about by the changing nature of the battlefield.

“The next fight won’t look like the last one,” he said. “The lines are blurred. The frontlines are everywhere. And in this new environment, everything and everyone is a target—including our medics, our supply lines, our communications, even our care platforms.”

“What does this all tell us?” continued Ferrara. “It tells us that military medicine—and military medical research—must evolve from the inside out. We can’t afford to develop in isolation and test in comfort. We must design for the fight we’re going to face, not the one we remember.”

Ferrara said the path forward is clear.

“That means training in chaos, not in calm. It means testing technologies under fire, not under fluorescent lights. And it means asking, ‘Will this help a medic save a life when they are the only one left standing?’ The answer must be yes.”

Supporting the Deployed Warfighter through Military Medical Research

MHSRS provides a unique opportunity for researchers, healthcare professionals, and DOD leaders to share the latest research findings and advances in combat casualty care, military operational medicine, clinical and rehabilitative medicine, and infectious diseases.

The 2025 call for submissions drew 2,744 research abstracts in 69 scientific topic areas covering the four MHSRS focus areas—warfighter medical readiness, expeditionary medicine, warfighter performance, and return to duty—a 15% increase over 2024. The 473 oral presentations chosen by peer review represent the best of this year's submitted abstracts.

The plenary featured remarks from Brig. Gen. (Dr.) Zivan Aviad Beer, surgeon general of the Israeli Defense Forces discussing the IDF Medical Corps' advancements in military medicine during nearly two years of conflict.

Veterans Affairs, which provides health coverage for veterans and their dependents, did not include abortion in its coverage until 2022.
President Joe Biden’s administration added it months after the U.S. Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade and state abortion bans began kicking in.
The VA says in its proposal that allowing abortion is legally questionable because Congress has not specifically allowed it.
The conservative law firm Alliance Defending Freedom called on the VA to drop abortion coverage in a letter last month, saying the cost or providing abortion takes other health resources away from veterans.","President Donald Trump’s administration is calling to remove abortion coverage from the list of medical benefits for veterans and their families, saying it’s not needed.

The Department of Veterans Affairs posted the proposed rule change on Monday and opened a public comment period on it that runs through Sept. 3. The department said in its proposal that it wants to ensure it “provides only needed medical services to our nation’s heroes and their families.”

The department says it would still provide abortion in life-threatening circumstances — something state laws allow, even in places where bans are in place. But critics of the change note that abortion would not be provided when pregnancies are the result of rape or incest.

Amy Friedrich-Karnik, director of federal policy at the Guttmacher Institute, said in a statement that the change would cut off millions of veterans and their families from services.

“Veterans have historically faced significant barriers to reproductive health care, and with the current patchwork of abortion bans and restrictions across the country, these barriers are even steeper today,” she said.

Veterans Affairs, which provides health coverage for veterans and their dependents, did not include abortion in its coverage until 2022. President Joe Biden’s administration added it months after the U.S. Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade and state abortion bans began kicking in.

The Biden changed allowed the VA to provide abortion even in states where it was banned. The VA says in its proposal that allowing abortion is legally questionable because Congress has not specifically allowed it. The policy change would also bring the VA’s coverage into line with other federal health care plans — including Medicaid and the TriCare coverage for active military members and their families — which exclude abortion in most cases.

The VA said in its filings that about 100 veterans and 40 dependents obtain abortions using the benefits each year — far below the projection the department made in 2022 of a total of 1,000 a year.

Under the contract extension, Amwell will continue to provide its comprehensive technology-enabled care platform to power virtual care delivered by MHS providers. The platform for scheduled virtual visits has been successfully deployed, on time and on budget, across the global DOD enterprise and to the U.S. Military Entrance Processing Command (MEPCOM) and the U.S. Coast Guard (USCG).

The platform replaced the MHS Video Connect solution, enabling providers with tech-enabled care. It is fully integrated within the MHS electronic health record and continues to enable the provision of dynamic health solutions for our military care teams, service members, and their families.

Through integrated platform solutions, Amwell is contributing to important efficiency initiatives, reducing burdens on care teams, improving the health and wellness of beneficiaries, reducing healthcare costs and optimizing the effective utilization of DHA's clinical resources across their global enterprise.

“Our platform is in use across the global DOD enterprise, enabling high quality, efficient care for this important population. We are grateful for the service of our nation’s military, and we are proud to be supporting their wellbeing,” said Ido Schoenberg, M.D., chairman and CEO of Amwell. “We are honored to extend this relationship and support the Department of Defense initiatives to realize the benefits of tech-enabled care across the MHS.”

The DHA’s Digital Front Door initiative has brought new capabilities and enablement to MHS GENESIS, an advanced electronic health record (EHR) and healthcare system solution that supports military and Veteran healthcare initiatives. The Amwell platform has deep integration assets and a simple yet powerful user experience that enables efficient and high-quality technology-enabled care delivery. The platform is already embedded into existing clinical workflows that care teams rely on, including those within the MHS GENESIS EHR. Amwell is providing technology to enable the DHA to leverage the benefits of hybrid care, improve access to healthcare, and ultimately improve outcomes for the MHS community.

Some highlights of platform success to date include:

Nearly tripling of virtual visits since replacing the DHA’s MHS Video Connect capability

Recent expansion beyond DHA sites to include MHS beneficiaries in the USCG and U.S. MEPCOM

Successful virtual visits from deployed units in a combat zone connected to a military hospital in the United States

The DHA supports U.S. national security and ensures our nation’s military teams are ready to deploy. Digital First supports the entire MHS community of users, which includes approximately 9.6 million active-duty service members, family members, retirees, and health professionals across the continuum of care.

The Commerce Clause Challenge The court’s reasoning rested on the dormant commerce clause doctrine, which states that because the Constitution grants Congress the power to regulate interstate commerce, states may not unjustifiably discriminate against interstate commerce.
The court opined that because Arkansas already has laws in place regulating PBM reimbursement and prohibiting certain PBM business tactics, the breadth of Act 624 is unjustifiable.

On July 28, 2025, the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Arkansas issued an order preliminarily enjoining enforcement of Arkansas' Act 624, a recently enacted, first-of-its-kind law that would prohibit pharmacy benefits managers (PBMs) from owning or operating pharmacies in Arkansas, effective January 1, 2026.

Act 624 was enacted based on growing concern that “vertical integration [by PBMs has] transformed PBMs from useful administrative service providers into market-dominating behemoths that control the industry.” For instance, through years of horizontal consolidation, the three largest PBMs—CVS Caremark, Express Scripts and OptumRx—now “process 80% of the nation’s prescriptions and bring in 70% of specialty drug revenue.” At the same time, the top six PBMs have vertically integrated downstream by acquiring and operating their own affiliated pharmacies. Id.

Majority of Claims Likely to Fail

The order holds that although the plaintiffs are likely to fail on six of their eight claims, their likelihood of success on the remaining two claims—based on the preliminary evidence and law before the court—is high enough to warrant pausing enforcement of Act 624 pending the outcome of the suit. Thus, this case will now move to litigation, where the court will be able to assess the PBM act based on evidence gathered during discovery and further arguments brought by the parties.

This order follows a series of lawsuits challenging Act 624, which was passed into law on April 16, 2025. The lead plaintiffs in the key lawsuits are some of the largest actors in the pharmacy and PBM industries: Express Scripts Inc. (a PBM owned by health insurer Cigna Healthcare), Optum Inc. (a PBM owed by health insurer UnitedHealth Group), CVS Pharmacy Inc. and the Pharmaceutical Care Management Association. Their cases were eventually consolidated into Express Scripts, Inc. v. Richmond, so the court’s order was a response to the combined legal efforts of these parties, including multiple complaints and motions for a preliminary injunction. Together, those pleadings raise eight challenges to the PBM act, arguing that it violates the U.S. Constitution’s privileges and immunities clause, bill of attainder clause, takings clause, equal protection clause, commerce clause and supremacy clause—the last of which plaintiffs argue Act 624 violates as it is preempted by TRICARE, Medicare and the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (ERISA).

Two Claims Have a Chance of Success

The order assesses each of these legal challenges and concludes that all but two of the challenges (the commerce clause and supremacy clause challenges) are likely to fail at trial.

The Commerce Clause Challenge

The court’s reasoning rested on the dormant commerce clause doctrine, which states that because the Constitution grants Congress the power to regulate interstate commerce, states may not unjustifiably discriminate against interstate commerce. The court opined that because Arkansas already has laws in place regulating PBM reimbursement and prohibiting certain PBM business tactics, the breadth of Act 624 is unjustifiable.

The Supremacy Clause Challenge

The court held that because the TRICARE program already has contracts with PBM-owned pharmacies in Arkansas, and because Act 624 would give Arkansas power over TRICARE’s future in-state contracts, Act 624 would conflict with the TRICARE statute. Since federal laws preempt state laws, the court said that TRICARE therefore preempts Act 624.

Conclusion

Although this order likely postpones Act 624’s effective date, a preliminary injunction is just that: preliminary. The court’s reasoning for the commerce clause and supremacy clause challenges rests entirely on a preliminary assessment of existing law. But since those challenges are now moving to litigation, both parties must now present evidence for their claims, along with additional legal arguments, which will inform the final decision on Act 624 at trial. Further, the court’s reasoning for one of the challenges is a constitutional doctrine (that of the dormant commerce clause) that has been expressly rejected by several recent U.S. Supreme Court justices. This could affect the success of any appeal of this case. Thus, although the order pauses Act 624’s enforcement, the order is temporary, and the full merits of the case—and of Act 624’s legality—have yet to be assessed.

Dr. Stephen Ferrara, acting assistant secretary of defense for health affairs, expressed his gratitude to researchers in his opening remarks, noting, “It’s a real honor to be here with so many dedicated military and civilian researchers.”

“There are few prouder legacies in military medicine than our research legacy. This audience sits atop broad shoulders, on the shoulders of giants, but you've never rested on that legacy,” said Ferrara. “On the contrary, you're challenged by it. You challenge yourselves to live up to the highest standards, the standards set by those who came before you, not only the famous names, but also the quiet heroes who toiled and innovated anonymously for mission, for country, but most of all for their patient.”

Touching on the conference’s theme, “Supporting the Deployed Warfighter through Military Medical Research,” Ferrara said, “When I talk about the 3 ‘S’s’ that comprise our mission—supporting our warfighter, sustaining our clinical skills, and strengthening our chain—your work exemplifies these priorities.”

Ferrara addressed the challenges facing military medicine brought about by the changing nature of the battlefield.

“The next fight won’t look like the last one,” he said. “The lines are blurred. The frontlines are everywhere. And in this new environment, everything and everyone is a target—including our medics, our supply lines, our communications, even our care platforms.”

“What does this all tell us?” continued Ferrara. “It tells us that military medicine—and military medical research—must evolve from the inside out. We can’t afford to develop in isolation and test in comfort. We must design for the fight we’re going to face, not the one we remember.”

Ferrara said the path forward is clear.

“That means training in chaos, not in calm. It means testing technologies under fire, not under fluorescent lights. And it means asking, ‘Will this help a medic save a life when they are the only one left standing?’ The answer must be yes.”

Supporting the Deployed Warfighter through Military Medical Research

MHSRS provides a unique opportunity for researchers, healthcare professionals, and DOD leaders to share the latest research findings and advances in combat casualty care, military operational medicine, clinical and rehabilitative medicine, and infectious diseases.

The 2025 call for submissions drew 2,744 research abstracts in 69 scientific topic areas covering the four MHSRS focus areas—warfighter medical readiness, expeditionary medicine, warfighter performance, and return to duty—a 15% increase over 2024. The 473 oral presentations chosen by peer review represent the best of this year's submitted abstracts.

The plenary featured remarks from Brig. Gen. (Dr.) Zivan Aviad Beer, surgeon general of the Israeli Defense Forces discussing the IDF Medical Corps' advancements in military medicine during nearly two years of conflict.

“The story of the IDF Medical Corps is one of innovation and transformation,” said Beer. “Our ability to rapidly adapt and transition from ideation to execution makes the medical corps unique, and allowed us to save more lives than ever before.”

A panel discussion on “Drone Warfare and the New Resilience Paradigm” closed the opening session.

“Today, we'll see, hear, and I hope you will feel, the physical and mental injury inflicted by a new type of war, the relentless drone warfare,” said co-moderator Dr. John Holcomb, professor of trauma and acute care surgery at the University of Alabama Birmingham Department of Surgery.

Preferred habitat You’ll find the seasoned milspouse in places that require stamina, strategy, or caffeine.
Distinguishing features The seasoned milspouse doesn’t wear a rank.","The seasoned milspouse is a rare creature, sort of like a CW5. She doesn’t wear a sash. She doesn’t have a title or a patch that says, “I’ve done this more times than I can count.” But she’s out there, holding it down at commissaries and change-of-command ceremonies, hauling bins across the country, waving on the curb while holding back her own unraveling.

You just have to know what you’re looking for.

She knows exactly how many boxes it takes to pack a three-bedroom duplex. She knows when the moving company is lying. She can decipher acronyms in her sleep, and she’s learned, sometimes the hard way, that the system will not reward her for being polite.

Spotting the species in the wild

Contrary to popular belief, the seasoned milspouse does not travel in large herds. She blends in. So you won’t find her leading those full-cringe icebreakers or working the room at FRG potlucks. Instead, she’s the one slipping out the side door with the folding tables and a half-deflated balloon arch.

Her purse contains exactly what someone will need later: blister Band-Aids, mini deodorant, a half-eaten protein bar, and the number for that one pediatric dentist who takes Tricare and has lollipops. If you ask, she’ll hand you any of them. Except the protein bar. That’s hers.

She scans the room and sees everything: who’s new, who’s spiraling, who’s trying too hard. She doesn’t judge. If you catch her watching someone too long, she’s probably building a support strategy that she will never get credit for.

You might think she’s just standing by the juice boxes. You’d be wrong. She’s running recon.

Preferred habitat

You’ll find the seasoned milspouse in places that require stamina, strategy, or caffeine. The commissary before 10 a.m. The base clinic after a Tricare portal outage. The school pickup line, parked early, already halfway through a snack she didn’t intend to share.

She does not linger near gate guards unless she’s filing a formal complaint, in which case: Godspeed.

You won’t find her on the unit spouse Facebook page unless something truly unhinged is going down. Even then, she’s just there for the comments. If you see her at the Commander’s Town Hall? She’s not confused about what’s going on there. She’s just waiting to see who speaks up first.

Call signs

In the wild, seasoned milspouses are rarely called by their full names. Instead, they earn unofficial identifiers. These nicknames are passed through group chats, school pickup lines, and post-wide lore.

If you hear one of these names whispered at the commissary, pay attention. You might be in the presence of greatness.

Never flustered. Carries a labeled, color-coded PCS binder with an actual cross-reference system. Runs point during every crisis. Could deploy a family of five across three time zones without breaking a nail.

Snackline 6

Always has the fruit snacks. Always knows who needs them. Functions as a mobile morale unit for tired kids, stressed spouses, and occasionally E-4s on the verge of a meltdown.

Mama Wolf

Not to be confused with Mama Bear. This seasoned milspouse knows which teacher needs a stern email, which provider to request at Medical, and how to make a grown man cry at housing without raising her voice.

The Chaplain’s Wife’s Best Friend

Knows everyone. Trusted with the real stories. Can get you on a casserole list or off one, depending on your behavior.

OCONUS Barbie

Wears layers. Has OCONUS-move trauma. Knows how to do taxes in yen. Still uses WhatsApp because she has actual international friends.

Ghost Protocol

Rarely seen. No social media. No drama. But if you ever get a late-night message that says “Heard what happened. Do you need a sitter and/or a bottle of wine?” it’s her.

Distinguishing features

The seasoned milspouse doesn’t wear a rank. But she does carry a tote bag with mysterious stains from five duty stations ago. It’s seen things. So has she.

Her email folder system could frighten a battalion S1. She has a spreadsheet for every PCS and a binder labeled “Just in Case.” If you see her pause during a conversation and mutter “I have a doc for that,” she’s not bluffing.

She dresses in layers: emotionally and literally. There’s a cardigan in her bag, a backup emotional boundary in her glove compartment, and enough trauma bonding stories to level a small book club.

She has strong opinions about base housing layouts, and she’s right. If you ask her about the four-bedroom near the park, she will either whisper “black mold” or nod once, solemnly, and say “that one’s solid.”

If you mention EFMP, she will close her eyes briefly. When she opens them again, she’ll hand you a snack. This is not just kindness. This is a sacred rite. Accept the snack.

You can approach her

Just don’t be weird about it. She doesn’t care how many deployments you’ve survived, or whether your spouse’s job sounds cool at parties. She cares whether you return borrowed Tupperware. Whether you show up when you say you will. Whether you ask for help without making it a whole thing.

She doesn’t need a protégé. She’s not trying to adopt a baby spouse. But if you’ve got a real question, and you’re not just looking for shortcuts, she might hand you the answer that actually helps.

Or she might hand you a laminated chart.

Either way, you’re in good hands.",https://www.wearethemighty.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/seasoned-milspouse-pavel-danilyuk-pexels.jpg?quality=85,N,0.0,2025-08-05 13:56:30.272308

The four-day symposium is a premier opportunity for OPMED, part of the Defense Health Agency, to showcase its current capabilities for a wide array of defense, development industry, and academic stakeholders.

FHP plays a critical role in bridging medical gaps by providing investigational medical products, which are authorized for emergency use by the Food and Drug Administration, to the joint force when no FDA-approved solution is available or feasible to meet operational requirements. FHP works with combatant commands and regulatory experts across the globe to make lifesaving treatments available to Warfighters when there is an urgent need.

MHSRS, which provides a venue for presenting new scientific knowledge resulting from military-unique research and development, gives FHP a chance to highlight the vital role it plays in support of operational medical units and combatant commands around the world, according to U.S. Army Col. Chuck Bane, director of FHP.

The team’s focus aligns with the broader DOD and DHA imperatives to provide real-time solutions for combatant commanders to address capability gaps in support of Warfighters in remote, austere environments.

“The FHP mission is unique within the DOD, and we are the focal point of mission-enabling activity to rapidly fill urgent capability gaps in time-compressed operational environments,” said Bane, an Army veterinarian by trade. “We partner with stakeholders across the DOD and government to provide alternative solutions in extraordinary circumstances so combatant commanders can focus on their mission while having the confidence that medical countermeasures are safe, timely, and suited to the operating environment to enhance mission readiness and increase Warfighter lethality.”

BRAVE is primarily for active duty service members—and overseas, it’s available to adult active duty family members.
According to Patrick Brady, the BRAVE program director, BRAVE offers a lifeline to service members when local services are stretched thin.
“We need to make sure that everyone understands the value of BRAVE and how it can support our service members,” Barnard said.
Service members are also using the tools they’ve learned through the BRAVE program to help others.","AUGUST 5, 2025 – The Defense Health Agency’s Behavioral Health Resources and Virtual Experience, or BRAVE, is helping our patients around the world get quicker access to mental health resources.

BRAVE augments local mental health services with video teleconferencing at facilities where mental health services may be in short supply.

BRAVE is primarily for active duty service members—and overseas, it’s available to adult active duty family members. The program is embedded at 84 locations in the U.S., Europe, and Indo-Pacific region, spanning 11 time zones.

BRAVE offers services like medication management, psychotherapy, and mental health evaluations to patients who need less intensive care and monitoring. This allows local mental health providers to focus on patients with more acute needs, shortening wait times and improving services.

The DHA Virtual Medical Center in San Antonio, Texas, administers BRAVE. According to Patrick Brady, the BRAVE program director, BRAVE offers a lifeline to service members when local services are stretched thin.

“BRAVE allows us to help patients build skills and tools to improve their mental health and well-being when those services otherwise wouldn’t be available,” said Brady. “We’re providing support where we might be the only behavioral provider at that time.”

BRAVE services focus on brief interventions, with all providers trained in evidence-based approaches. The team consists of medication management prescribers and therapists, including psychologists and licensed clinical social workers.

Therapy sessions usually occur once a week for 12 to 17 sessions, according to Melanee Barnard, a BRAVE health system specialist at the DHA Virtual Medical Center.

Patients don’t have to be at the clinic to use BRAVE. Barnard said “85% of BRAVE appointments” occur with patients outside the clinic, which makes access easier, and can put patients at ease. “Meeting from their home or other location helps them feel secure and private,” she said.

Real-life impact: Misawa Air Base, Japan

Misawa Air Base in northern Japan, with 5,200 active duty service members, launched BRAVE in August 2023. U.S. Air Force Maj. Kimberly Lane is the mental health flight commander for the 35th Operational Medical Readiness Squadron at Misawa.

“BRAVE is an invaluable resource for Misawa due to constant manning constraints because of our isolated location, PCS’s [permanent change of station], and deployments,” said Lane.

“BRAVE has let us provide care to a remote, isolated U.S. Army unit, slashing wait times from 32 to five days” for first appointments, Lane said.

Remote BRAVE services also make care more appealing for some at Misawa, Lane said. Some clinic staff find that their close working relationships with mental health providers make them reluctant to seek care locally. “Many clients like the anonymity BRAVE provides,” she said.

Looking ahead

According to Brady, BRAVE makes a significant impact on the patients who use it, the facilities where it’s offered, and the whole DHA. Benefits include quicker care, lower costs, reduced stigma, and better patient engagement.

The DHA plans for BRAVE to be available worldwide by the end of 2025. DHA is also looking to make BRAVE services available to more patients, including more active duty family members. DHA also plans to add adolescent mental health and medication management services.

Since the launch of BRAVE on Nov. 5, 2022, the program has facilitated about 60,000 virtual therapy sessions.

BRAVE practitioners are some of the program’s biggest promoters. “We need to make sure that everyone understands the value of BRAVE and how it can support our service members,” Barnard said.

Service members are also using the tools they’ve learned through the BRAVE program to help others. Barnard said she’s heard of BRAVE patients saying: “’Hey, battle buddy, I’m getting into the trench with you because I’ve been there.’”

She added, “I encourage leadership and providers to continue promoting BRAVE as a frontline option for those facing barriers to in-person care.”

In conclusion, while Amwell's recent contract extension with the Military Health System underscores its strategic importance in the telehealth sector, the company's financial metrics reveal significant challenges.
Investors should carefully consider the risks and opportunities presented by Amwell's current market positioning and financial health.","Amwell (AMWL, Financial) has secured an extension of its contract for the ongoing digital transformation of the Military Health System (MHS), as part of a collaboration led by Leidos. This move involves continuing to supply its advanced technology platform that facilitates virtual healthcare for roughly 9.6 million MHS beneficiaries.

The platform supports scheduled virtual visits and has been effectively implemented on a global scale within the Department of Defense (DOD) network, specifically reaching the U.S. Military Entrance Processing Command and the U.S. Coast Guard. The deployment was completed punctually and within budget, ensuring seamless virtual care provision by MHS providers.

American Well Corp, known as Amwell, is a prominent player in the telehealth sector, providing a digital care delivery solution that empowers health systems, health plans, government entities, and innovative clients. The platform supports a wide range of healthcare services, from primary and urgent care to high-acuity specialty consults like telestroke and telepsychiatry. Amwell's comprehensive offerings include both on-demand and scheduled consultations, catering to diverse healthcare needs.

Operating within the healthcare sector, specifically under the Healthcare Providers & Services industry, Amwell has a market capitalization of approximately $125.37 million. The company's strategic positioning in the telehealth market is underscored by its ability to facilitate care delivery across the full healthcare continuum, enhancing accessibility and efficiency in healthcare services.

Financial Health Analysis

Amwell's financial metrics present a mixed picture of its current health:

Revenue: The company reported trailing twelve-month sales of $261.68 million, though it has experienced a revenue decline of 3.4% over the past year.

Margins: Operating margin stands at -66.08%, with a net margin of -59.14%, indicating significant challenges in achieving profitability.

Balance Sheet: Amwell maintains a strong current ratio of 2.92, suggesting adequate liquidity to cover short-term liabilities. The debt-to-equity ratio is low at 0.03, reflecting minimal leverage.

Warning Signs: The Altman Z-Score of -6.03 places the company in the distress zone, implying a potential risk of bankruptcy within the next two years. Additionally, insider selling activity has been notable, with four transactions in the past three months.

Business Performance

Amwell's revenue trends highlight a challenging environment, with a decline in revenue growth over the past few years. Despite this, the company's platform continues to drive digital transformation in healthcare, as evidenced by its recent contract extension with the Military Health System.

Operational efficiency remains a concern, as reflected in the company's negative operating and net margins. However, Amwell's strategic focus on expanding its telehealth offerings positions it well within the rapidly evolving healthcare landscape.

Valuation & Market Sentiment

Amwell's valuation metrics provide insights into its current market positioning:

Price-to-Sales (P/S) Ratio: At 0.43, the P/S ratio is close to its one-year low, suggesting potential undervaluation.

Price-to-Book (P/B) Ratio: The P/B ratio stands at 0.43, also near its one-year low, indicating a possible value opportunity.

Analyst Recommendations: The average recommendation score is 2.9, reflecting a hold sentiment among analysts.

Technical Indicators: The Relative Strength Index (RSI) of 36.77 suggests the stock is approaching oversold territory, while moving averages indicate a mixed trend.

Risk Assessment

Amwell's financial health grades highlight several areas of concern:

Financial Strength: The Beneish M-Score of -3.53 suggests the company is unlikely to be a manipulator, providing some reassurance regarding financial reporting integrity.

Sector-Specific Risks: As a telehealth provider, Amwell faces regulatory and competitive pressures, which could impact its growth trajectory.

Volatility: With a beta of 2.2, the stock exhibits higher volatility compared to the broader market, indicating potential price fluctuations.

In conclusion, while Amwell's recent contract extension with the Military Health System underscores its strategic importance in the telehealth sector, the company's financial metrics reveal significant challenges.

BOSTON, Aug. 05, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Amwell® (NYSE: AMWL), a leading technology-enabled care platform provider, announced that as part of a Leidos-led partnership, it has been awarded an extension of its next-generation Digital First contract to power the digital transformation of the Military Health System (MHS), which serves approximately 9.6 million beneficiaries.

Under the contract extension, Amwell will continue to provide its comprehensive technology-enabled care platform to power virtual care delivered by MHS providers. The platform for scheduled virtual visits has been successfully deployed, on time and on budget, across the global DOD enterprise and to the U.S. Military Entrance Processing Command (MEPCOM) and the U.S. Coast Guard (USCG).

The platform replaced the MHS Video Connect solution, enabling providers with tech-enabled care. It is fully integrated within the MHS electronic health record and continues to enable the provision of dynamic health solutions for our military care teams, service members, and their families.

Through integrated platform solutions, Amwell is contributing to important efficiency initiatives, reducing burdens on care teams, improving the health and wellness of beneficiaries, reducing healthcare costs and optimizing the effective utilization of DHA's clinical resources across their global enterprise.

“Our platform is in use across the global DOD enterprise, enabling high quality, efficient care for this important population. We are grateful for the service of our nation’s military, and we are proud to be supporting their wellbeing,” said Ido Schoenberg, M.D., chairman and CEO of Amwell. “We are honored to extend this relationship and support the Department of Defense initiatives to realize the benefits of tech-enabled care across the MHS.”

The DHA’s Digital Front Door initiative has brought new capabilities and enablement to MHS GENESIS, an advanced electronic health record (EHR) and healthcare system solution that supports military and Veteran healthcare initiatives. The Amwell platform has deep integration assets and a simple yet powerful user experience that enables efficient and high-quality technology-enabled care delivery. The platform is already embedded into existing clinical workflows that care teams rely on, including those within the MHS GENESIS EHR. Amwell is providing technology to enable the DHA to leverage the benefits of hybrid care, improve access to healthcare, and ultimately improve outcomes for the MHS community.

Some highlights of platform success to date include:

Nearly tripling of virtual visits since replacing the DHA’s MHS Video Connect capability

Recent expansion beyond DHA sites to include MHS beneficiaries in the USCG and U.S. MEPCOM

Successful virtual visits from deployed units in a combat zone connected to a military hospital in the United States

The DHA supports U.S. national security and ensures our nation’s military teams are ready to deploy. Digital First supports the entire MHS community of users, which includes approximately 9.6 million active-duty service members, family members, retirees, and health professionals across the continuum of care.

Company expects to initiate Phase 1b study with CDI-988 in norovirus-infected healthy subjects later this year

Lack of approved norovirus treatments or vaccines creates critical unmet medical need

BOTHELL, Wash., Aug. 05, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Cocrystal Pharma, Inc. (Nasdaq: COCP) announces the presentation of favorable safety and tolerability data from a randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled Phase 1 study with its oral, direct-acting pan-viral inhibitor CDI-988 at the 2025 Military Health System Research Symposium (MHSRS), being held August 4-7 in Kissimmee, Florida. The results support Cocrystal’s continued clinical development of CDI-988 as a potential norovirus prophylaxis and treatment.

In An Oral Pan-viral Protease Inhibitor for the Prevention and Treatment of Norovirus and Coronavirus Infections: Mechanism of Action and Phase 1 Study Results, Sam Lee, Ph.D., Cocrystal President and co-CEO, discussed findings from the CDI-988 Phase 1 single-ascending (SAD) and multiple-ascending (MAD) cohorts. Data indicate that all doses, ranging from 100 mg to 1200 mg, were well tolerated. Overall treatment-emergent adverse events among CDI-988 subjects were 28% (10/36) compared with 40% (4/10) among placebo subjects for the SAD cohorts, and 53% (19/36) and 92% (11/12), respectively, for the MAD cohorts. Headache was the most common adverse event. All subjects in the SAD cohorts and all but one in the MAD cohorts completed the study. No severe treatment-emergent adverse events, no clinically relevant ECG changes and no clinically significant pathology results were reported from the CDI-988 Phase 1 single-ascending (SAD) and multiple-ascending (MAD) cohorts.

“Consistent with interim results from the Phase 1 study, CDI-988 was well-tolerated with a favorable safety profile across all dose levels tested in this study,” said Dr. Lee. “Our plan to continue CDI-988’s clinical development for norovirus is particularly relevant for the military, where this highly transmissible pathogen poses significant operational and economic risks. In confined settings such as naval vessels and military installations, norovirus can rapidly spread, causing debilitating gastrointestinal symptoms that could compromise mission readiness.

“The absence of approved norovirus treatments or vaccines creates a critical unmet medical need,” he added. “Norovirus presents significant vaccine development challenges due to its high genetic variability and mutation rate. CDI-988's mechanism of action targeting viral replication and its broad-spectrum coverage offers a promising solution as a potential prophylactic and therapeutic intervention across all norovirus genogroups including GII.4 and GII.17. This could be a new approach to outbreak prevention and management. We expect to initiate a Phase 1b challenge study with CDI-988 in norovirus-infected healthy subjects later this year.”

MHSRS is an annual educational symposium with approximately 4,000 attendees that provides a collaborative environment for military medical care providers with deployment experience, research and academic scientists, international partners and industry on research and related healthcare initiatives falling under the topic areas of combat casualty care, military operational medicine, clinical and rehabilitative medicine, information sciences, military infectious diseases and radiation health effects. More information is available here.

Pan-viral Protease Inhibitor CDI-988

CDI-988 was designed and developed with Cocrystal’s proprietary structure-based platform technology as a broad-spectrum inhibitor to a highly conserved region in the active site of 3CL viral proteases. Based on a novel mechanism of action and superior broad-spectrum antiviral activity, CDI-988 represents a compelling first potential oral treatment for noroviruses, and for coronaviruses.

Norovirus Infection

Norovirus is a common and highly contagious virus that afflicts people of all ages and causes symptoms of acute gastroenteritis including nausea, vomiting, stomach pain and diarrhea, as well as fatigue, fever and dehydration. Norovirus outbreaks occur most commonly in semi-closed communities such as hospitals, nursing homes, childcare facilities, cruise ships, schools and disaster relief sites. Norovirus infections are estimated to cost society approximately $60 billion annually worldwide.

As the global market expands at a projected 18.7% CAGR, companies like Talkspace are redefining accessibility and affordability in behavioral care. But sustainability in this competitive arena requires more than growth—it demands a resilient business model.

Financial Performance: A Tale of Two Models

Talkspace's Q1 2025 results highlight a strategic pivot from direct-to-consumer (DTC) to payer-centric growth. Total revenue hit $52.2 million, up 15% year-over-year, driven by a 33% surge in Payor revenue to $37.8 million. However, Consumer revenue plummeted 32%, underscoring the sector's shift toward institutional partnerships. This trend aligns with industry peers like BetterHelp, which also reported declining DTC performance as payers consolidate market share.

The company's gross profit grew 7% to $23.3 million, though gross margins dipped to 44.6% due to the lower-margin nature of Payor contracts. Operating expenses rose 4% to $24.4 million, yet net income reached $0.3 million—up from a $1.5 million loss in Q1 2024. Adjusted EBITDA hit $2.0 million, a 153% increase, signaling improved profitability.

Talkspace's balance sheet is equally compelling. With $60.1 million in cash and $48.3 million in short-term securities, the company remains debt-free, allowing it to fund expansion without dilution. Its 2025 guidance—$220–235 million revenue and $14–20 million adjusted EBITDA—suggests a path to sustained profitability, even as margins compress.

Strategic Shift: Payers as a Growth Engine

Talkspace's success hinges on its in-network partnerships with Medicare, TRICARE, and major insurers, covering 179.4 million lives. These contracts provide stable, recurring revenue and insulate the company from economic volatility. For instance, Medicare members achieved 84% clinical improvement—surpassing industry benchmarks—and TRICARE users reported high engagement due to strong community referral networks.

This pivot also addresses a critical pain point: continuity of care. Talkspace's “easy button” system allows employees to transition from employer-sponsored EAPs to insurance-covered therapy, reducing churn. Meanwhile, innovations like Talkcast—an AI-powered podcast tool for therapists—enhance engagement, with 90% of trial users finding it helpful.

Competitive Landscape: Navigating a Crowded Field

The mental health tech market is packed with players, from startups like Kintsugi to incumbents like Teladoc. Yet Talkspace's payer-centric model sets it apart. While competitors like Modern Health and Iris Telehealth focus on DTC or enterprise wellness, Talkspace leverages its in-network status to scale affordably.

Its 33% Payor growth in Q1 2025 outperformed industry averages, and its 200M+ covered lives represent a 37% YoY expansion. By contrast, DTE revenue dropped 3% as employers trimmed EAP budgets, and DTC fell 32% as users shifted to insurance-based care. Talkspace's ability to offset these declines with payer growth demonstrates its adaptability.

Sustainability and Risks

Talkspace's long-term viability depends on three pillars: payer expansion, technological innovation, and cost control. The company's Medicare and TRICARE partnerships are a goldmine, with 84% clinical improvement rates attracting more payers. International expansion into markets like Pakistan, where demand surged 40%, further diversifies its revenue base.

However, risks persist. The Payor model's lower margins could pressure profitability if costs rise. Additionally, regulatory shifts in insurance reimbursement or telehealth reimbursement rates could disrupt revenue. Yet Talkspace's debt-free balance sheet and $7 million share repurchase program in Q1 2025 signal confidence in its ability to navigate these challenges.

Investment Thesis: A Buy for Resilient Growth

Talkspace's strategic shift to payer-centric growth, combined with its strong financial position and market-leading partnerships, makes it a compelling long-term play. While DTC and DTE segments face headwinds, the company's focus on institutional clients—where demand is rising—positions it to capture a larger share of the $32.97 billion market by 2032.

Investors should also note the company's 2026 revenue target of $300 million (20–25% CAGR) and 15% EBITDA margin, which align with industry benchmarks. For those seeking exposure to the mental health boom, Talkspace offers a balanced mix of growth and stability—provided they're willing to weather near-term margin pressures.

Final Verdict: Buy for investors with a 3–5 year horizon. Prioritize Talkspace's payer expansion and AI-driven engagement tools as key catalysts. Monitor regulatory risks and ensure diversification in a volatile sector.

This analysis underscores Talkspace's ability to thrive in a competitive landscape by aligning with market trends. Its payer model, technological edge, and financial discipline position it as a leader in the digital mental health revolution—a rare combination in an industry still finding its footing.",https://www.ainvest.com/wencai-ssr/og-image-news-20240226.png,N,0.0,2025-08-05 11:56:57.870208

The presentation builds on Recce’s ongoing Cooperative Research and Development Agreement (CRADA) with the US Army’s top biodefence facility, USAMRIID.

Significant laboratory results against bioterrorism threats

The data presented stems from studies conducted by the Battelle Biomedical Research Center (BBRC), using minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) assays. R327 demonstrated antimicrobial activity against five CDC-listed high-priority threats: Bacillus anthracis, Francisella tularensis, Burkholderia mallei, Burkholderia pseudomallei and Yersinia pestis. Potent responses were noted particularly against the first three pathogens, with MIC values ranging from 75 to 600 micrograms per millilitre (µg/mL).

Despite higher concentrations being required for B. mallei and B. pseudomallei, results confirmed R327’s broad-spectrum efficacy across both Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria. The data also aligned with efficacy observed in Recce’s previous testing against ESKAPE pathogens.

Novel mechanism counters resistant strains

RECCE® 327 acts via a unique dual mechanism — targeting both adenosine triphosphate (ATP) synthesis and bacterial membrane integrity. This enables activity against multidrug-resistant (MDR) strains, including those resistant to levofloxacin. According to the CDC Antimicrobial Resistance Isolate Bank, tested strains carried resistance genotypes such as mexA, mcr1 and KPC, yet remained susceptible to R327.

These findings suggest that traditional resistance mechanisms are unlikely to compromise R327’s efficacy in clinical settings. The compound's resilience against established resistance pathways underscores its value as a potential countermeasure for both military and public health applications.

Future optimisation and formulation pathways

The pure form of R327 comprises roughly 52,000 µg/mL of oligomers, although significant antimicrobial activity likely derives from a small subset. Ongoing studies aim to identify and isolate the most active oligomer species to refine dosage and reduce calculated MIC values. This could enhance R327’s clinical utility and scalability.

Separately, Recce has received US$2 million in funding from the US Department of Defense’s Congressionally Directed Medical Research Program (CDMRP) to develop R327G — a gel-based formulation for treating burn wound infections. This project aligns with the broader goal of delivering versatile anti-infectives for field and clinical deployment.

Engagement at premier military research forum

The MHSRS is the US Department of Defense’s flagship research forum, attracting around 4,000 delegates annually. It serves as a venue for presenting scientific advances with direct relevance to Warfighter health and readiness. The 2025 symposium will be held in Kissimmee, Florida, from August 4–7.

MHSRS is a DOD-sponsored event that brings together leading experts from across the military and medical development industry to discuss the current and future states of military medicine, and to showcase the latest devices and technologies designed to preserve and protect the lives of America’s warfighters.

During the event, OPMED experts will showcase the medical solutions they are developing through partnerships and agreements with DoD and private sector organizations. The team’s current programs are designed to fill capability gaps across the spectrum of combat casualty care—from point of injury and evacuation to hospitalization—with an emphasis on Large-Scale Combat Operations in remote, austere environments.

“Future conflicts will present complex and evolving challenges unique to modern warfare,” said U.S. Army Col. Owen L. Roberts, program manager for OPMED. “We are driving rapid capability development to deliver critical solutions directly to frontline medics. Our mission is clear: field life-saving technologies that protect service members on the battlefield and return them to duty without delay.”

MHSRS is an opportunity to show OPMED’s current and potential partners the strength of its core programs and the team’s persistent focus on meeting the needs of the U.S. Joint Force, according to Roberts.

“The accelerating pace of warfighting technology leaves no room for complacency,” he said. “Getting lifesaving capabilities to the front lines is critical to preserving Joint Force lethality and staying ahead of modern threats. As the DOD’s Joint medical capability developer, OPMED stands ready to deliver exactly what the Joint Force needs to fight and win—anywhere, against any adversary.”

""We need to design, test, and field medical solutions with an emphasis on agility, adaptability, and speed.
Everything we do in military medicine comes back to one question: Can we save a life when it matters most?""","KISSIMMEE, Fla. — Three of the Defense Health Agency Research & Development-Medical Research and Development Command's most distinguished senior researchers were recognized for their noteworthy accomplishments in military medicine throughout the previous year during an awards ceremony at the opening plenary session of the 2025 Military Health System Research Symposium on Aug. 4. Their achievements supporting the physical and psychological health of the Warfighter demonstrate DHA R&D-MRDC's vital contributions to MHSRS.

""MHSRS is a unique and valuable opportunity for DHA to showcase the many ways our military medical innovations improve Warfighter survivability and lethality, enhance force protection and readiness, drive medical modernization throughout the DHA enterprise, and contribute to deterrence and posture at the theater and global levels as part of the DHA's role as a Combat Support Agency,"" says Maj. Gen. Paula Lodi, DHA R&D-MRDC's commanding general. ""It's also a chance for us to explore potential collaborations with some of the brightest minds across the DOD, academia, international partners, and industry, which will ensure we continue to develop and deliver solutions that will protect and sustain our Warfighters in every environment.""

Dr. Karl Friedl, the U.S. Army's chief physiologist assigned to the U.S. Army Research Institute of Environmental Medicine, and former commander of DHA R&D-MRDC's Telemedicine and Advanced Technology Research Center, received an award for distinguished service for his work on the DOD's Optimizing the Human Weapon System program, a force-wide evaluation of the use of data collected from wearable sensors to inform decisions about Warfighter readiness. In this role, Friedel is responsible for forming broad multidisciplinary collaborations and conducting research on Soldier health and performance, with an emphasis on translating biomedical research findings into implementation for Soldiers and veterans.

A research team from the Biotechnology High-Performance Computing Software Applications Institute led by Dr. Jaques Reifman, BHSAI's senior researcher and director, was recognized for outstanding research accomplishments by a team for the development of the Automated Processing of the Physiological Registry for Assessment of Injury Severity Hemorrhage Risk Index. APPRAISE-HRI is an AI-enabled decision-support system designed to help combat medics triage trauma casualties for hemorrhage risk near the point of injury. Not only is APPRAISE-HRI the first triage system ever cleared by the FDA for assessing hemorrhage risk of trauma patients, it is also the first – and so far, only – AI-enabled Software as a Medical Device from the DOD approved by the FDA.

A multidisciplinary team of regulatory affairs, compliance, and clinical support professionals from the Office of Regulated Activities led by Dr. Chandar Thakur, chief of ORA's Medical Devices and Diagnostics Branch, was recognized for outstanding program management by a team for their success in obtaining marketing clearances by the FDA for five medical products last year – which is believed to be a record number for the office. The products meet urgent military medical requirements for solutions that ensure Warfighter resilience, adaptability, and lethality. The team's success in fielding these products directly contributes to DHA R&D-MRDC's ability to improve combat casualty care and enhance human performance.

Col. Elisa O'Hern, commander of the U.S. Army Institute of Surgical Research, part of DHA R&D-MRDC, emceed the award ceremony.

Over 200 DHA R&D-MRDC experts in military infectious diseases, combat casualty care, military operational medicine, chemical biological defense, and clinical and rehabilitative medicine are attending the annual four-day event, the DOD's premier medical science research and development meeting. They will be leading panel discussions, presenting their latest research findings, and participating in poster sessions throughout the symposium.

In addition to participating as speakers and presenters, representatives from the Office of Medical Technology Transfer, Office of Regulated Activities, Office of Human and Animal Research Oversight, U.S. Army Medical Research Institute of Infectious Diseases, U.S. Army Aeromedical Research Laboratory, and Walter Reed Army Institute of Research will be on hand in the exhibit hall to showcase their work in deployable treatments, trauma care solutions, and lifesaving medical devices designed to ensure our forces remain resilient, adaptable, and lethal in any scenario.

More than 3,000 representatives of the military services, industry, and academia are attending MHSRS. The theme of this year's symposium is ""Supporting the Deployed Warfighter through Military Medical Research.""

In his keynote address, Acting Assistant Secretary of Defense for Health Affairs Dr. Stephen Ferrara emphasized the critical role that research plays in enabling the Military Health System to ensure peak Warfighter survivability and readiness.

""We have to consider the research we're doing, the testing we're conducting, and the solutions we're fielding – are they relevant and are we moving quickly enough?"" Ferrara asked. ""We need to design, test, and field medical solutions with an emphasis on agility, adaptability, and speed.

I do have a sleep study scheduled in a couple weeks and they may wind up diagnosing me with sleep apnea which may let me continue uninterrupted. Sigh. ​

The Defense Health Agency’s Behavioral Health Resources and Virtual Experience, or BRAVE, is helping our patients around the world get quicker access to mental health resources. BRAVE augments local mental health services with video teleconferencing at facilities where mental health services may be in short supply.

BRAVE is primarily for active duty service members—and overseas, it’s available to adult active duty family members. The program is embedded at 84 locations in the U.S., Europe, and Indo-Pacific region, spanning 11 time zones.

BRAVE offers services like medication management, psychotherapy, and mental health evaluations to patients who need less intensive care and monitoring. This allows local mental health providers to focus on patients with more acute needs, shortening wait times and improving services.

The DHA Virtual Medical Center in San Antonio, Texas, administers BRAVE. According to Patrick Brady, the BRAVE program director, BRAVE offers a lifeline to service members when local services are stretched thin. “BRAVE allows us to help patients build skills and tools to improve their mental health and well-being when those services otherwise wouldn’t be available,” said Brady. “We’re providing support where we might be the only behavioral provider at that time.”

BRAVE services focus on brief interventions, with all providers trained in evidence-based approaches. The team consists of medication management prescribers and therapists, including psychologists and licensed clinical social workers. Therapy sessions usually occur once a week for 12 to 17 sessions, according to Melanee Barnard, a BRAVE health system specialist at the DHA Virtual Medical Center.

Patients don’t have to be at the clinic to use BRAVE. Barnard said “85% of BRAVE appointments” occur with patients outside the clinic, which makes access easier, and can put patients at ease. “Meeting from their home or other location helps them feel secure and private,” she said.

Real-life impact: Misawa Air Base, Japan

Misawa Air Base in northern Japan, with 5,200 active duty service members, launched BRAVE in August 2023. U.S. Air Force Maj. Kimberly Lane is the mental health flight commander for the 35th Operational Medical Readiness Squadron at Misawa. “BRAVE is an invaluable resource for Misawa due to constant manning constraints because of our isolated location, PCS's [permanent change of station], and deployments,” said Lane. “BRAVE has let us provide care to a remote, isolated U.S. Army unit, slashing wait times from 32 to five days” for first appointments, she added.

Remote BRAVE services also make care more appealing for some at Misawa, Lane said. Some clinic staff find that their close working relationships with mental health providers make them reluctant to seek care locally. “Many clients like the anonymity BRAVE provides,” she said.

Looking ahead

According to Brady, BRAVE makes a significant impact on the patients who use it, the facilities where it’s offered, and the whole DHA. Benefits include quicker care, lower costs, reduced stigma, and better patient engagement.

The DHA plans for BRAVE to be available worldwide by the end of 2025. DHA is also looking to make BRAVE services available to more patients, including more active duty family members. DHA also plans to add adolescent mental health and medication management services.

Since the launch of BRAVE on Nov. 5, 2022, the program has facilitated about 60,000 virtual therapy sessions.

BRAVE practitioners are some of the program’s biggest promoters. “We need to make sure that everyone understands the value of BRAVE and how it can support our service members,” Barnard said.

Service members are also using the tools they’ve learned through the BRAVE program to help others. Barnard said she’s heard of BRAVE patients saying: “’Hey, battle buddy, I'm getting into the trench with you because I've been there.’”

She added, “I encourage leadership and providers to continue promoting BRAVE as a frontline option for those facing barriers to in-person care.”

What Happened

On July 16, 49 attorneys general (AGs) announced that they joined a $202 million settlement with Gilead Sciences, Inc. (Gilead). Previously announced by the Department of Justice in April, the settlement resolved allegations that the company incentivized doctors to prescribe its medication through HIV speaker programs.

The Details

The allegations against Gilead arose from a 2016 whistleblower suit accusing Gilead of violating the federal Anti-Kickback Statute and state false claims laws. The allegations centered on Gilead’s practice of paying health care providers honoraria, meals, and travel expenses to induce them to prescribe its HIV drugs. Between 2011 and 2017, Gilead hosted “HIV Speakers” programs, which were often held at luxury restaurants and involved repeat attendance by high-prescribing health care providers. The government claimed this conduct led to false claims being submitted to Medicare, Medicaid, TRICARE, and the AIDS Drug Assistance Program.

Gilead agreed to a settlement of $177 million, with $88.5 million constituting restitution to the U.S., as fully detailed in the stipulation and order of settlement between the U.S. government, led by the U.S. attorney for the Southern District of New York, and Gilead. The stipulation also included terms for Gilead’s cooperation in ongoing investigations and specific compliance conditions to avoid further penalties or exclusion from federal health programs.

Separate Settlement Agreement With States

As stated in the stipulation, Gilead also intended to enter a separate $25 million settlement with various states to resolve state law claims. A National Association of Medicaid Fraud Units team, led by the New York AG, was responsible for the states’ investigation and negotiations with Gilead. As announced, Gilead’s $202 million settlement successfully resolves the allegations with 49 state and territorial AGs, but four states — Indiana, Maryland, Mississippi, and Texas — did not join.

Why It Matters

Gilead’s decision to reach a settlement with both federal and state regulators allows the company to move forward after this enforcement action. Holistic settlements help companies avoid prolonged periods of negotiating multiple settlements, reducing stress on a company’s legal team and allowing decision-makers to move forward from enforcement issues.

I can say firsthand I was treated for mental conditions while active duty and it didn’t affect my career at all. Yes it will be in your records but they don’t discriminate for mental health. Plus when you eventually do get out you may want a good record of your conditions if you continue to need treatment or things get worse. Nothing good comes from trying to hide symptoms or avoid care you really need. Take care of yourself.

I understand the hesitation, but that's the part of you that needs treatment talking. Making up reasons to avoid treatment or why it would be difficult to even start. In my house we call that self-sabotaging part the demon. That's the demon talking.

Get yourself taken care of. You need for you to be healthy and so does your spouse. Tricare is amazing, so I can't imagine that the cost will be much, if anything. And as far as your service goes, avoiding treatment and spiraling out is a way bigger red flag than seeking necessary care.

Be good to yourself. Be kind to yourself. And tell the demon to fuck right off, because he's an asshole who hates you.

Ok. I've got to ask....what exactly is it that you think is going to affect your military career? And what even makes you think that it would end up in your military record anyways?

From personal experience, nothing I've done through private health care (physical or mental) has ever even shown up in my military records. On top of that, you can still serve in the Reserve with 100% P&T VA disability, including PTSD (speaking, again, from personal experience). Your private healthcare providers are not connected to any military system, regardless of whether or not Tricare is the one cutting the check. Hell, the VA healthcare treatments aren't even in the military system! What makes you think private providers are?

So...what makes you think that getting help for your mental health is going to somehow magically get into your military record and damage your career?

In addition to offering valuable career advice to budding young scientists, the engagement also supported DHA R&D-MRDC’s mission to cultivate the future workforce that will ensure DHA R&D-MRDC remains in the forefront of military medical research and innovation.

Dr. Carrie Quinn, Deputy to DHA R&D-MRDC’s Commanding General, and Col Jacob Johnson, a Fellow in the U.S. Army Medical Research Institute of Infectious Diseases Biosafety and Biosecurity Program, spoke about their career influences, educational background, military research, and leadership assignments to the GEMS near-peer mentors, who provide academic guidance to elementary school students participating in the annual extracurricular STEM education program. Quinn and Johnson were among a dozen subject matter experts from across the command who spoke to students and mentors throughout the five-week program.

In her discussion, Quinn emphasized that students could follow many paths to a career in science, citing her own eclectic journey as an example. After working as a physical therapist and emergency medical technician, she joined the U.S. Army so that she could pursue a position as a research scientist at the U.S. Army Research Institute of Environmental Medicine, part of DHA R&D-MRDC. There, she led a team conducting research into human performance in extreme environments. As director of USARIEM’s GEMS program, she was famous for greeting the students with high-fives every morning as they arrived at the front gate of the Natick Soldier Systems Center.

“There's no normal pathway. It's the pathway you want to follow,” said Quinn. “I followed almost none of the normal trajectory because I was willing to say yes to opportunities that sounded maybe a little bit weird. Every next job I've had has been better than what I expected it to be, and the number of doors that each opportunity has opened has been spectacular. So, don’t be afraid to say ‘yes.’”

In addition to conducting research in military medicine, Quinn has long been interested in its strategic policy aspects as well. Prior to joining DHA R&D-MRDC, she served in the Office of the Undersecretary of Defense for Research and Engineering as a senior advisor for critical and emerging technologies. She also worked for the Defense Intelligence Agency, where she served on special assignment to the White House Situation Room supporting the President, Vice President, and the National Security Advisor.

Quinn stressed that rapid advances in science and technology such as artificial intelligence in decision making, organoids for biological testing, and drones in combat will require tomorrow’s scientists to have a strong grounding in ethics.

“You are going to confront so many more ethical questions in your STEM careers than what I've ever had to deal with up to this point,” said Quinn. “Know your moral compass and do not stray from that. We have a saying in the Army: ‘the hard right and the easy wrong,’ If you choose to go with the easy wrong, you'll lose every time, and you’ll lose the faith and trust of your followers. And getting that back is almost a hundred percent not going to happen.”

Johnson emphasized that a STEM education can be parlayed into career opportunities beyond conducting research in an academic laboratory. STEM skills and knowledge are valuable assets for careers in fields as varied as publishing, technology transfer, program management, policy, and even financial services. Many of these non-laboratory activities play vital roles in DHA R&D-MRDC’s day-to-day operations.

“The career space today is completely different than it was decades ago, when I was in school, and it's constantly changing,” said Johnson. “The idea that you have to wear a white coat and work at a lab bench is only true if that’s the path you want to pursue. There are so many options out there, just waiting for you.”

To explore those opportunities, Johnson encouraged the near-peer mentors to actively seek out people in those fields who would be willing to share their experience and knowledge and introduce them to colleagues who can help them get a foot in the door.

“If I didn't have the folks who assisted me since the seventh grade, I don't know that I would be here right now,” said Johnson. “They inspired me when I was having tough moments, they believed in me when I doubted myself, and they encouraged me when I frustrated. That's why I keep coming back every year to speak at the GEMS program.”

Johnson has a doctorate in cell biology and immunology from the University of Cincinnati College of Medicine. After completing the Army Medical Department Officer’s Basic Course, the Army assigned him to DHA R&D-MRDC’s Walter Reed Army Institute of Research as a principal research investigator. Prior to his fellowship, he was director of the DOD Blast Injury Research Coordinating Office and the Joint Trauma Analysis & Prevention of Injury in Combat program office, located at DHA R&D-MRDC’s headquarters at Fort Detrick. As a biosafety and biosecurity program fellow, Johnson is gaining practical experience in how to conduct operations in high-security environments of the DOD’s most complex biosafety level 3 and 4 laboratories.

Johnson says workforce development is a vital prerequisite for DHA R&D-MRDC to be able to carry out its mission to improve warfighter survivability and lethality, enhance force protection and readiness, drive medical modernization throughout the DHA enterprise, and contribute to deterrence and posture at the theater and global levels.

“I look at programs like GEMS as the lifeblood of our scientific bench,” said Johnson. “We are planting a seed with future scientists who could go on to impact government science, whether they end up wearing the uniform or serving as a civilian or contractor, or working with one of our partners in the larger community of interest. The near-peer mentors who participate in GEMS are getting a full-spectrum learning opportunity that will prepare them for their professional education and hopefully inspire them to become lifelong learners. Who knows what game-changing medicines or devices they could create?”",https://dha.mil/-/media/Project/Images/News-Images/9232865.jpg,N,0.0,2025-08-04 12:56:13.119034
