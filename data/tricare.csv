A series of strong and damaging storms swept across the Midwest this week, leaving many residents looking to rebuild in their wake.

Many residents’ personal items and property sustained damage throughout the storms in places like Nevada, Missouri, where some residents lost their homes and businesses.

In a way to provide some relief to those affected, the Defense Health Agency announced Thursday that TRICARE beneficiaries in Missouri may be eligible to receive emergency refills from April 3 through April 13.

TRICARE says the refill waivers will take effect for all affected counties in Missouri.

DHA also suggests residents visit the pharmacy where their initial prescription was filled if possible.

“Prescriptions filled by a retail chain may be filled at another store in that chain. If the clinician who prescribed the medication is available, beneficiaries can ask them to call in a new prescription to any network pharmacy.”",https://fox4kc.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/16/2024/12/6765bf98ef9cc5.43785839.jpeg?w=1280,N,1.0,2025-04-03 22:56:19.957171

Owner Meichell Worthing tells News 3 she thought the issues with TRICARE were going to be resolved by the end of March, but she said as of April 3, they hadn’t been.

She had stopped accepting new TRICARE clients and told current clients she won’t continue service for more than two weeks without a referral from a physician. Some clients, though, she said, are finding that getting in to see a physician can take months.

“Our service members and their families deserve better than this,"" said Worthing.

She said not getting paid from TRICARE was costing her business around $25,000 a month.

“I need to pay my staff. They can’t continue to go unpaid. So I’m going to have to get a loan. It’s going to have interest and all these other things on it and I’m going to be paying out of that to take care of my staff because I love my staff,"" Worthing explained. ""Not every business owner can do that, or would, but I shouldn’t have to. I shouldn’t have to get a loan to pay my staff because TRICARE’s not paying their bills.""

She worried the recent extension of the Norfolk-based USS Harry S. Truman Carrier Strike Group may increase the number of people needing counseling services, something she may not be able to provide.

In the meantime, there was also concern for current clients.

Elizabeth Hunter works with Worthing and remembers an interaction with a TRICARE client when she found out she wouldn’t be able to continue her service.

""She left my office in tears saying, 'I don’t know what I’m going to do.' That’s heartbreaking,"" Hunter said.

News 3 reached out to TRICARE for comment. A statement from the Defense Health Agency said in the region that includes Hampton Roads, fixes have been made and contract claims requirements should be met by April 30.

The TRICARE Managed Care Support Contractors in the East and West Regions, Humana Military and TriWest Healthcare Alliance respectively, both experienced claims processing issues at the start of the TRICARE 5th Generation contracts on January 1, 2025. Early slow claims processing was the result of two factors. First, at the beginning of every calendar year, as Medicare changes its rates, TRICARE is obligated to change its rates as well. Claims payments are always slightly slower in the first month of the year in order to make sure that those rates have been properly applied. Additionally, the TRICARE Managed Care Support Contractors review the claims after submission to verify that the numbers and provider information are correct before claims are paid. This time frame has now passed, and claims are now flowing faster.

As of late -March 2025, Humana Military processed 3.9 million claims, which aligns with expected claims volumes. In the East Region, as of February 28th, Humana Military implemented technical fixes that improved claims processing and they are expected to meet contract claims requirements by April 30, 2025. Humana has stated that no providers have left the network due to claims issues.

Humana Military also sent News 3 a statement, which says, in part, the majority of issues have been fixed and they ""are working closely with impacted providers to ensure they continue to care for TRICARE East Region beneficiaries.”",https://ewscripps.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/979c423/2147483647/strip/true/crop/1876x985+0+43/resize/1200x630!/quality/90/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fewscripps-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fcf%2F3f%2Ff632bc2d4ec3ba1744d98b31620b%2Fscreenshot-2025-04-03-at-5-06-52-pm.png,N,-1.0,2025-04-03 18:56:29.659533

She was behaving impulsively; hitting, kicking, and biting friends for seemingly no reason. I was getting calls a couple times a week, having to sign countless incident reports, and at a loss for how to curb these behaviors.

We were referred to Project Enlightenment and signed papers to have someone come observe. We went through the process, did our best to follow the advice we’d been given but were still struggling. These behaviors persisted till the end of her time in preschool (with a small break for Covid) where we ultimately pulled her out a few months early because we were tired of paying so much only to have her sent home early for bad behavior. We were realizing that her behaviors were extreme for her age but that didn’t mean we knew what to do.

When she was four, we made an appointment for parent counseling, again through Project Enlightenment. After a few sessions, our counselor asked if we had ever considered ADHD. We had not. In fact, aside from knowing a handful of kids in my youth that had been prescribed Ritalin, I didn’t know much about it at all.

In figuring out our next steps, we began exploring the possibility of psychological assessments. But where do we go? Who could do this for us? What about the months-long waitlists? If you’re anything like I was, you’re probably already overwhelmed and the thought of doing this research is yet another hurdle to jump. So with that being said, I have collected recommendations for practices from across the triangle that can perform psychological assessments and hopefully get you one step closer to finding answers for your family.

Troy E. Black, Senior Enlisted Advisor to the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, told a room full of Defense Health Agency staff while pointing to the American flag.
Black emphasized the importance of standardizing medical treatment and casualty care across the services to ensure common standards of care, and the need to assess capabilities and resources to support high-casualty scenarios.
Underscoring the need to collaborate across the services, Black said, “All service branches do it differently.

Maj. Troy E. Black, Senior Enlisted Advisor to the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, told a room full of Defense Health Agency staff while pointing to the American flag.

In a town hall meeting, Black told staff at the Defense Health Headquarters in Falls Church, Virginia, the military operates at a “strategic level now, talking about what happens when nation states go to war, and how do we understand the scope and the scale of that?

“History is 100% accurate, no matter how we want to read it,” Black added. “There will be another conflict or war. They will go to scale.”

Black said the U.S. military needs to be ready for large-scale conflict like America hasn’t seen since World War II, including to ensure its medical system–military and civilian–is prepared for large and continuous waves of wounded.

He said DHA must proactively align its efforts with the changing character of warfare and the military's needs, rather than waiting for direction. He also noted the importance of close collaboration with the services and combatant commands to understand their evolving requirements and ensure DHA is prepared to provide necessary combat support.

Black emphasized the importance of standardizing medical treatment and casualty care across the services to ensure common standards of care, and the need to assess capabilities and resources to support high-casualty scenarios.

Underscoring the need to collaborate across the services, Black said, “All service branches do it differently. All have different equipment. All have different links of training to meet the same requirement or additional requirements. All do different platforms in a different uniform all the different ways,” adding, “We have to be focused on how we save a human being at the point of injury under fire by an adversary.”

First and foremost, Black stressed, is the need for service members to be ready to fight at a moment’s notice. He reiterated the need to come together to support the warfighter, as “you're dealing with the one thing: preservation of life.”

Black concluded by reminding everyone, “It’s not all bad news! Remember this: We win.”",https://d1ldvf68ux039x.cloudfront.net/thumbs/photos/2504/8952221/1000w_q95.jpg,N,0.0,2025-04-03 16:56:21.402766

Zynex’s Disappointing Fourth Quarter Results

ZYXI share price depression stems from its disastrous 4Q 2024 earnings release. The Englewood, Colorado-based firm reported fourth-quarter 2024 revenue of $46.0 million, a roughly 2% year-over-year decline, falling short of Wall Street's expectations. The company also swung to a net loss of $0.02 per share, a stark contrast to the $0.04 net income per share reported in the same period last year.

The disappointing results reportedly prompted RBC Capital Markets to downgrade Zynex to Sector Perform from Outperform. According to news outlets, in a report to its clients, RBC analyst Shagun Singh cited a ""lack of visibility"" into the company's operations and commercial outlook, particularly concerning its relationship with Tricare, the military health program that represents a significant portion of Zynex's revenue.

Singh reportedly noted that Tricare, Zynex's largest customer, has temporarily suspended payments amid an ongoing review of prior claims. Singh added that the company's decision to withhold 2025 guidance and implement a 15% workforce reduction further compounded investor concerns. Singh revised RBC’s price target for Zynex shares to $5.50, down from $11.00, warning of a potential ""domino effect"" stemming from Tricare's payment suspension.

Zynex Securities Class Action

Adding to Zynex’s woes, a securities class action lawsuit has been filed in the District Court of Colorado, alleging that the company made false and misleading statements regarding its revenue recognition practices and its relationship with Tricare. The suit, captioned Tuncel v. Zynex, Inc., et al., seeks to represent investors who purchased Zynex securities between March 13, 2023, and March 11, 2025.

The complaint alleges that Zynex engaged in “oversupplying” customers with products, including electrodes, leading to inflated revenue figures. It further claims that this practice drew scrutiny from insurers, including Tricare, and that Zynex failed to disclose the potential for adverse consequences, such as removal from insurer networks and government penalties.

According to the complaint, revelations of Zynex's alleged practices surfaced with a June 4, 2024 report by medical journal STAAT detailing an ""oversupplying scheme"" involving excessive shipments of supplies and subsequent inflated billing. The report also indicated that insurers were ""kicking the company out of network.""

The truth allegedly emerged on March 11, 2025, when Zynex reported its dismal Q4 and FY 2024 financial results. The complaint highlights Zynex CEO Thomas Sandgaard’s attributing the fourth-quarter revenue shortfall to ""slower than normal payments from certain payers"" and the Tricare payment suspension.

Hagens Berman’s Investigation

Hagens Berman is investigating the alleged claims. “We are examining Zynex's financial reporting and business practices. We believe investors deserve a complete and transparent understanding of these events,” said Reed Kathrein, the Hagens Berman Partner leading the firm's probe.

— Kari Harman, VP of Business and Clinical Development

PENSACOLA , FL, UNITED STATES, April 3, 2025 /EINPresswire.com/ -- Lovell® Government Services and HealWell HealthCare Solutions, a leading provider of antimicrobial gel, announced today that they have partnered to serve federal healthcare systems such as the Veterans Health Administration (VHA), the Military Health System (MHS), and the Indian Health Service (IHS). Lovell Government Services will serve as HealWell Solutions’ Service-Disabled Veteran-Owned Small Business (SDVOSB) vendor to serve these customers through federal contracting systems.

HealWell Gel is FDA OTC and specifically indicated to ""treat"" wound infections as opposed to silver based and other forms labeled to ""prevent"". This distinction is for most part based on the fact that silver is antimicrobial only in ionic form and this form is known to be cytotoxic. Cytotoxicity is hard to document in vivo because the length of time it takes any given wound to heal is unknown. The cytotoxicity of ionic silver has been repeatedly demonstrated in the laboratory. HealWell Gel and its' PHMB concentration of 0.5% enjoys a toxic therapeutic ration of 14:1, ie: it is essentially non-toxic. HealWell Gel is an ideal antimicrobial primary dressing: effective against essentially all pathogens, protective barrier, donates moisture and biocide for up to 7 days for weekly changes. One tube of 45 grams/1.5oz may yield up to 30-40 applications.

As HealWell HealthCare Solutions’ SDVOSB Vendor, Lovell is excited to bring this product to federal healthcare providers. HealWell Solutions is available on the Department of Veterans Affairs’ Federal Supply Schedule (FSS), GSA Advantage, the Defense Logistics Agency’s Electronic Catalog (ECAT), and the Department of Defense’s Distribution and Pricing Agreement (DAPA). Listing products on contract vehicles with Lovell streamlines the acquisition process while helping government agencies meet their SDVOSB procurement goals.

""We're excited to partner with HealWell Solutions to bring HealWell Gel to the federal healthcare space. This collaboration strengthens our commitment to providing innovative wound care solutions that support the healing of those who serve our nation.” said Chris Lovell, Major, USMC (Ret.), CEO of Lovell Government Services.

“We are thrilled to partner with Lovell Government Services to provide a high quality, aimed at enhancing community collaborations. Through this partnership, we are committed to delivering evidence-based wound are products to support our Veterans, Military personnel and Indian Health Services."" said Kari Harman, RN, CCM, CWCA, WCN-C, CSWD-C, FCC, ACCWS, DAPWCA

About HealWell Solutions

The Founders’ Journey: From Nurses to Community Champions

HealWell Wound Care Solutions was born from a desire to address a gap in the wound care system, particularly in rural areas. Randi Jones and Kari Harman, seasoned nurses with almost 40-years of combined wound care experience, co-founded HealWell Wound Care Solutions, LLC in 2021 after witnessing firsthand the challenges patients face. ""We saw patients and their families overwhelmed by the complexities of wound care once they were home,"" says Randi. ""We knew there had to be a better way."" Kari adds, ""We wanted to bring expert care to people where they feel safest and most comfortable — their homes. The aim was not just to treat wounds but to support the whole person and their mental well-being.""

Looking ahead, HealWell Health Care Solutions, LLC aims to expand its services, reaching more communities and continuing to innovate in home-based and community based wound care. Their mission is clear: to provide compassionate, comprehensive wound care that supports both physical and mental health, all in the comfort of home.

Your catastrophic cap limits how much you and your family will pay for TRICARE covered healthcare services each calendar year.

“When your family reaches your catastrophic cap, TRICARE pays for all remaining covered costs,” said Debra Fisher, health system specialist, Policy & Programs Branch, TRICARE Health Plan, at the Defense Health Agency. “This means you won’t be responsible for the cost of the TRICARE-allowed portion of any covered service for the rest of the year.”

Each TRICARE plan has a catastrophic cap. Knowing how your catastrophic cap works can help you make healthcare decisions for yourself and your family members.

Q: What is my TRICARE catastrophic cap amount?

A: Your catastrophic cap amount is determined by:

Your TRICARE health plan

Your sponsor or beneficiary type

Your beneficiary group

You’re in Group A if your or your sponsor’s initial enlistment or appointment began before Jan. 1, 2018.

You’re in Group B if your or your sponsor’s initial enlistment or appointment began on or after Jan. 1, 2018.

Catastrophic cap amounts may change each year. The 2025 catastrophic cap ranges from $1,000 to $4,509, as shown in the tables below.

TRICARE Prime and TRICARE Select catastrophic caps

Sponsor or Beneficiary Type Group A Group B Active duty family members $1,000 per family $1,288 per family Survivors of active duty deceased sponsor; medically retired uniformed service member and family members $3,000 per family $4,509 per family Retirees, family members of retirees, and qualified unremarried former spouses TRICARE Prime: $3,000 per family

TRICARE Select: $4,261 per family $4,509 per family

Catastrophic caps for other TRICARE plans

TRICARE Plan Group A Group B TRICARE Reserve Select Follow Group B $1,288 per family TRICARE Retired Reserve Follow Group B $4,509 per family TRICARE Young Adult Follow Group B Active duty family members: $1,288

Retiree family members: $4,509 Continued Health Care Benefit Program Follow Group B $4,509 per family

The catastrophic cap for TRICARE For Life is $3,000.

Q: What costs count toward my catastrophic cap?

A:

Copayments and cost-shares for TRICARE-covered healthcare services, inpatient and outpatient

Enrollment fees

Deductibles

Pharmacy copayments and cost-shares

Other cost-shares, based on TRICARE-allowable charges, provider type, and location

Q: What costs don’t count toward my catastrophic cap?

A: Costs that don’t count toward your catastrophic cap include:

Costs for services not covered by TRICARE

Point-of-service fees

Charges from non-participating providers. (You pay the difference between the TRICARE-allowable charge and the balance billing limit, which is up to 15% above the TRICARE-allowable charge.)

Monthly or quarterly premiums for TRICARE Reserve Select, TRICARE Retired Reserve, TRICARE Young Adult, and the Continued Health Care Benefit Program

Extended Care Health Option sponsor and beneficiary liabilities

Q: How will I know if I’ve met my catastrophic cap?

A: Check your TRICARE explanation of benefits. Your EOB will show how much of what you paid applied toward your family’s catastrophic cap for the claim. It’ll also show the total amount you’ve paid toward your catastrophic cap for that calendar year.

Q: What happens if I meet my catastrophic cap amount?

A: If your family reaches your catastrophic cap, TRICARE will pay your portion of the TRICARE-allowable amount for the rest of the calendar year.

Keep in mind that you’ll still have to pay fees that don’t fall under the catastrophic cap.

Your catastrophic cap will reset to $0 on Jan. 1 each year.

Q: What happens to my catastrophic cap if I change plans mid-year?

A: If you change plans during the calendar year under the same sponsor, any amount credited toward your previous catastrophic cap will be credited toward your new catastrophic cap.

Q: What other ways can I keep my out-of-pocket costs lower?

A: Because not all costs count toward your catastrophic cap, it’s important to understand what TRICARE covers and your plan’s rules for getting care.

Here are a few things to keep in mind before you get care.

If you have a TRICARE Prime plan (including TYA-Prime):

Active duty service members: You need a referral for any care your PCM doesn’t provide. You can’t use the point-of-service option.

All others: You need a referral for most care your PCM doesn’t provide. If you see a specialist without a referral, you’re using the point-of-service option.

If you have a TRICARE Select plan or a TRICARE premium-based plan (including TYA-Select):

You can see any TRICARE-authorized network or non-network provider. However, you’ll have lower out-of-pocket costs if you get care from a TRICARE network provider.",https://media.defense.gov/2025/Apr/03/2003681712/1920/1080/0/250403-O-D0202-1001.JPG,N,0.0,2025-04-03 11:56:23.534363

Jeremiah Moore (right), R-Clarendon, present House Bill 1150 to the House Committee on Insurance and Commerce on Wednesday, April 2, 2025. (Tess Vrbin/Arkansas Advocate)

A House panel Wednesday approved a bill aimed at preventing pharmacy benefit managers (PBMs) from holding a permit to operate a drug store in Arkansas.

Opponents outnumbered supporters in the public comment period of the House Insurance and Commerce Committee meeting, but a majority of the panel’s 21 members voted to send House Bill 1150 to the full House.

PBMs negotiate prescription benefits among drug manufacturers, distributors, pharmacies and health insurance providers, and they rank prescription drugs with the highest-tiered products costing consumers the lowest out-of-pocket costs. The Federal Trade Commission released an interim report in July 2024 saying these conglomerates are eliminating competition and increasing drug prices at the expense of patients.

“Pharmacy benefit managers are gaming the system to line their own pockets with taxpayers’ and patients’ money,” said HB 1150 sponsor Rep. Jeremiah Moore, R-Clarendon.

He decried the “patently false” statements circulating about the potential impact of HB 1150 from those who oppose it, such as the idea that 2.7 million Arkansans would lose access to health care. HB 1150 has faced a marketing campaign against it in the two and a half months since it was filed, and Moore said the opposition has primarily come from PBMs.

Some of Wednesday’s opponents of HB 1150 represented corporate health care organizations, including Russell Harper, a government relations executive with the Navitus Health Solutions PBM.

Harper said the bill “will result in lots of unintended consequences that will bring patient disruption, patient confusion and patient access issues to important drug treatments, not just in the commercial market, but in Medicare, Medicaid and Tricare.”

He claimed a wide swath of Arkansas pharmacies, including 23 within CVS and 26 within Kroger, would be at risk of closing if HB 1150 passes.

John Vinson, CEO of the Arkansas Pharmacists Association, denied the allegation that HB 1150 would force pharmacies to close by taking PBMs out of the competitive pharmacy market.

“It gives pharmacies a choice of whether they want to be a PBM or a pharmacy,” Vinson said. “[They would] pick one or the other.”

Debate

Several PBMs are affiliated with interstate mail-order pharmacy operations, and House Bill 1150 includes mail-order pharmacy permits among those that PBMs would be prohibited from holding. Vinson said Wednesday that some PBMs force consumers to receive their medications via mail, which costs more than receiving them over the counter.

Mike Castleberry claimed HB 1150 would reduce mail-order pharmacies’ presence in Arkansas to the point that patients would not be able to access necessary medication. Castleberry is chief revenue officer at Consociate Health, which represents “self-funded employers” in Arkansas, and he said many pharmacies can only afford to provide specialty drugs if they use mail-order operations.

is someone who’s on a specialty drug,” he said.

Randy Zook, president of the Arkansas Chamber of Commerce, said lawmakers should not make laws that attack vertical integration in business, but Vinson and Moore both said PBMs’ vertical integration is unique because they set their competitors’ prices.

OptumRX, Express Scripts and CVS Caremark  the three largest PBMs  are each owned by much larger corporations that each also own a top-10 health insurer. Together they control about 80% of the U.S. prescription market, according to last year’s Federal Trade Commission report.

CVS Caremark is a subsidiary of CVS Health, and District Leader of Pharmacy Operations Ashley Ellis expressed opposition to HB 1150 on Wednesday. Ellis said pharmacists that work for PBM-owned and corporate pharmacies are still members of their local communities, and they have access to the medications and equipment that serve people with complex health needs while independent pharmacies do not necessarily have these things.

Rep. Richard McGrew, R-Hot Springs, said he received several emails from constituents who ostensibly opposed HB 1150 but said they “knew nothing about this” when he contacted them. He alleged that the emails came from lobbyists against HB 1150 who received his constituents’ personal information from CVS, where they told him they receive prescription drugs.

McGrew questioned Ellis about this “breach of integrity,” and Ellis said she was not aware of this.

Past legislative action

Navitus Chief Pharmacy Officer Sharon Faust said Arkansas has been “a frontrunner” on regulating prescription drug access and prices, but HB 1150 would be “a step too far, a step further where you’re actually limiting patient choice [and] reducing competition.”

Vinson and Moore said PBMs routinely reimburse their affiliate pharmacies at a higher rate than their competitors, locally-owned independent pharmacies.

This practice is outlawed in Arkansas by Act 1 and Act 3 of 2018, which became law after a special legislative session. Arkansas lawmakers have been attempting to regulate PBMs for the past decade, starting with Act 900 of 2015, which required PBMs to pay pharmacies at least as much as the national average of what drugstores pay wholesalers for drugs.

Despite this, pharmacies sent the Arkansas Insurance Department (AID) roughly 3,000 complaints in 2024, claiming PBMs either illegally paid them below this national average or paid them at or just above this amount, AID’s general counsel told lawmakers last year. Independent pharmacists made similar claims in September, saying they were struggling to stay open in rural areas with limited healthcare resources.

The Arkansas Legislative Council approved a rule in December to require PBMs to include dispensing fees in their reimbursements for prescription drugs.

Removing PBM-affiliated pharmacies from the market would require the employee benefits division of the Arkansas government “to reevaluate and restructure their pharmacy networks and implement new compliance measures,” according to an actuarial statement measuring the fiscal impact of HB 1150.

to the plan from excluding certain retail pharmacies from their network, such as CVS Caremark,” according to the statement. “Such a change would require a significant number of EBD members to transfer their prescriptions to an in-network pharmacy and may reduce pharmacy network access.”

Patients are lost, frustrated and forced into passive participation in their own healthcare journey. It’s not a poorly designed system, it’s a system that was never designed.

So we took the best and brightest minds across the healthcare industry and designed a new way forward.

How did we get here?

It was compounded piece by piece: the creation of employer-sponsored healthcare during World War II, the creation of Medicare and Medicaid, new billing codes, HIPAA rules, Meaningful Use requirements, and the Affordable Care Act. All well-meaning, but designed without consideration for the entire ecosystem. As a result, we have Medicare, Medicaid, Tricare, and private insurance all running on different systems, with different rules for billing, approvals, and benefits—a chain of unnecessarily complex steps to accomplish straightforward tasks at exponentially rising costs.

But there’s hope. We’ve solved similarly complex, far-reaching problems before. Banks share common transaction standards through federal clearinghouses. Mortgage lenders simplified their agreements through Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. Even other countries with private healthcare, like Germany, have successfully standardized health plan designs and clinical policies across their entire system.

So we took the best and brightest minds across the healthcare industry and designed a new way forward. The PATIENTS Framework (Publicly Accountable Transparent Interoperable Efficient Nonproprietary Transaction Standard) is our blueprint for healthcare administrative reform and a thoughtfully-designed system that centers the patient in the healthcare transaction.

Patients deserve better

Incentive misalignment between business stakeholders in healthcare has resulted in an inadequate patient (and consumer) experience, lack of competition, outdated transaction processes, and dysfunctional payer-provider relationships. The numbers tell a stark story: 30% of all healthcare spending is wasted on administrative costs. This makes administrative complexity the single biggest component of excess US spending.

We believe the key to cutting administrative costs is replacing the patchwork of old, proprietary systems between health plans, providers, and middle men with a system that is simple, standardized, transparent, and most of all, patient-centered.

A truly patient-centered system is one that makes the complex simple; the fragmented, standardized; the opaque, transparent; the proprietary, open license; and most importantly, (we really can’t say it enough) the business-centered, patient centered.

When we get this right, healthcare works better for everyone:

Patients know exactly what their care will cost—and what quality to expect

Doctors and insurance companies work from the same, transparent playbook

Insurance plans use standardized benefit and network designs

Providers adopt standard processes for billing and patient payments

Everyone understands each step and can precisely predict their financial responsibility

How it works

We started by asking a fundamental question: In today’s world, what’s the simplest way to handle healthcare payments while ensuring excellent patient care?

From there, we developed the core tenets of an efficient transaction:

Consider the patient first

Strive for a perfectly efficient, payer-provider integrated transaction

Ensure backwards compatibility to existing transaction rails and payment systems

Set open license standards for interoperability

Create transparent documentation that anyone can understand

Then, we took a look at the status quo. Today, all healthcare transactions follow the Revenue Cycle: a 10+ step, months-long process that begins with scheduling an appointment and ends with patient collections and reporting. The PATIENTS framework condenses the healthcare transaction into fewer, more transparent steps—most of which are completed prior to the patient receiving care.

To see this in action, the framework includes these essential pieces:

Standard Modular Provider <> Group Purchaser Contract

Open Payment, Grouping and Pricing System

Universal Clinical Coverage Library

Standard Plan Design and Benefits Mapping

Open and Patient-Facing Transaction Rails

With new technology and a shared desire for change, we can move past the old ways of doing things that came before smartphones, AI, and the internet.

Farragut Department of Defense Education Activity (DoDEA) school and Naval Hospital Rota have collaborated to create a Student Support Roadmap, a comprehensive resource guide for youth in need of mental and behavioral health support. Modeled from the Navy’s Mental Health Roadmap, this tool outlines the pathway of services and resources available to military and civilian students who attend the DoDEA school, located on Naval Station Rota. For families stationed overseas, where access to mental health resources can be limited, reducing barriers to utilizing support services is essential.

The Student Support Roadmap outlines nine primary resources for students, including installation Chaplains, Fleet and Family Center counselors, Military Health System providers, imbedded school assets and emergency services. Incorporating a stop light color scale, it allows users to identify levels of care available, ranging from no issues for safety, which might be most appropriate for a Chaplain or Military and Family Life Counselor, to needing immediate care from the Emergency Room or Crisis Line.

“When first introduced to the Mental Health Roadmap I immediately saw its usefulness for adults and wondered, where is the corresponding roadmap for youth on base?” stated Scott Cypers, a Child Psychologist and Department Head of the Educational and Developmental Intervention Service. Working with partners from across the installation, Dr Cypers was able to bring his vision of a youth centric roadmap to life.

This proactive and preventative approach aims to identify and address potential issues before they escalate into more serious problems. The roadmap is tailored to meet the unique needs of military children, who often face challenges such as frequent moves, parental deployments, and adjusting to new environments.

“I do hope the Student Support Roadmap benefits parents and youth who may not be aware of all the options and how to access them for kids who have mental health concerns,” shared Dr. Cypers.

The collaboration between DoDEA and Naval Hospital Rota has been instrumental in the development and implementation of this tool. DoDEA brings its expertise in education and student support, while clinicians at Naval Hospital Rota provide knowledge and resources in mental and behavioral health care. This partnership has enabled the creation of a holistic and integrated approach to supporting children of Department of Defense personnel, one that addresses their academic, social, and emotional needs.

“Our goal with the Student Support Roadmap is to ensure that every student, regardless of their circumstances, has access to the right resources at the right time,” said Mr. Daniel Gostkowski, Assistant Principal of David G. Farragut DoDEA School. “We want to foster a school environment where students feel safe, supported, and understood, so they can focus on learning and personal growth”.

The Student Support Roadmap, implemented in January of 2025, has been widely shared through school and hospital outreach and messaging. DoDEA supports about 900 students in its installation base schools, though the opportunity for this tool to be used extends to the approximately 2400 DoD youth who rely on Naval Station Rota resources.

By providing a clear pathway for support, families can quickly and easily access the resources they need to help their children thrive. One of the key benefits of the student support roadmap is its focus on early intervention and prevention. By identifying and addressing potential issues early on, military children are more likely to receive the support they need to succeed academically and socially. This approach helps reduce the stigma associated with mental health issues, encouraging families to seek help when they need it.

As the military continues to face the challenges of overseas deployments and assignments and need for mental health support grows, the Student Support Roadmap will remain a vital resource, providing a foundation for the mental and behavioral health support that military children need to succeed.

Naval Hospital Rota, located strategically at the gateway of the Mediterranean, generates and sustains readiness to deliver critical medical support for Department of Defense missions throughout Europe, Africa, and the Middle East.

Months after the claims change, Meichell Worthing, Lighthouse Counseling owner, said the situation is continuing to impact her business.","VIRGINIA BEACH, Va. (WAVY) — Recent changes to the claims process for Tricare, the health insurance program for military members and their families, has impacted mental health clinics in Hampton Roads.

On Jan.1, a company named PGBA LLC began processing claims for the Tricare East Region.

However, a spokesperson for Humana Military, the regional contractor for the East Region, told NBC News that a “small percentage” of provider records in the claims administration system had outdated or incorrect data that prevented claims from being processed in January.

As a result of this, some local providers told 10 On Your Side they haven’t been paid by Tricare since the beginning of the year.

About 25% of clients that Lighthouse Counseling in Virginia Beach serve use Tricare. The practice said some of their counselors aren’t getting paid for the service they provide to those clients.

Elizabeth Hunter, a licensed professional counselor at Lighthouse Counseling, said she has not been paid by Tricare since January. She estimates she is owed around $6,000.

“When Tricare switched claims processing companies, that data migration didn’t happen well and data was lost, and my credentialing was lost in that process,” Hunter said.

Hunter explained that because she is a licensed professional counselor, her Tricare patients now have to get a referral through their primary care manager to continue to see her or it won’t be covered.

“My last client of the day told me [that] ‘to get a physician’s referral will take me three months. I cannot pay out of pocket, and I don’t know what to do,’” Hunter said.

Months after the claims change, Meichell Worthing, Lighthouse Counseling owner, said the situation is continuing to impact her business.

“Tricare represents roughly $25,000 a month for our practice,” Worthing said. “And so, we’re at three months in, that’s about $75,000 that we are out of on some level. They did give us a prepayment in January for some money to help the transition, but then haven’t really helped since then, and we’re still in the scenario where many of our counselors have not been paid for the services they’ve already provided.”

Meanwhile, Lighthouse Counseling clients that use Tricare such as Alex Arnold are trying to figure out what to do next.

“I don’t have a [primary care manager] to monitor my health, because nobody’s taking me in the time that the Navy has me here, which is only eight months,” Arnold said. “I don’t have many necessities healthcare-wise, [but] I would almost rather go with a broken arm for eight months than [going] without counseling for eight months.”

Going forward, Lighthouse Counseling offered its Tricare clients a new system where they will prepay for their services and the practice will reimburse them once Tricare pays them.

“Our servicemen and women and their families deserve better,” Hunter said. “They should not be having to go through this. They struggle enough, they have sacrificed enough and they should not have to sacrifice their mental health care because of some glitch in the system. Fix it sooner [rather] than later. Stop trying to deny it, stop trying to give misinformation. Figure out what the left hand is doing and what the right hand is doing and make it right.”

Opioid addiction is a national crisis—and military families aren’t immune. Whether you’re on active duty, a veteran, or a family member covered under TRICARE, you may be wondering how to get treatment for opioid use disorder (OUD).

The good news? TRICARE opioid rehab coverage is available and knowing your options can help you or your loved one take that first step towards recovery. TRICARE, while primarily known for serving military families, also covers civilian health care needs including mental health and addiction treatment services.

In this guide we’ll break down everything you need to know about TRICARE covered opioid rehab from the types of treatment available to how to get started so you can make informed decisions with confidence.

What is TRICARE?

TRICARE is the healthcare program for uniformed service members, retirees, and their families. It provides comprehensive medical coverage including mental health and substance use disorder (SUD) treatment. If you’re covered under any TRICARE plan—TRICARE Prime, TRICARE Select, TRICARE For Life, or TRICARE Reserve Select—you have access to opioid rehab services.

TRICARE covers many types of psychotherapy including various counseling formats and psychological testing. That’s important because opioid addiction isn’t just a personal issue—it affects the whole family and timely evidence-based care can make all the difference.

TRICARE Health Insurance Overview

TRICARE is a health insurance program specifically designed for military families and veterans so they have access to quality healthcare services. This program is part of the United States Department of Defense Military Health System and is designed to support the health and well-being of active-duty service members, retirees and their families.

TRICARE-Covered Detox Programs

Detox is often the first step in opioid rehab. It involves safely managing withdrawal symptoms under medical supervision. Opioid withdrawal can be intense—nausea, sweating, anxiety, muscle pain, and cravings are common.

Outpatient treatment includes various levels such as standard outpatient programs, intensive outpatient programs (IOPs), and partial hospitalization programs (PHPs). TRICARE covers both inpatient and outpatient detox if medically necessary. This is usually determined by a TRICARE-authorized provider. Inpatient detox may be required if withdrawal symptoms are severe or if there are co-occurring conditions that need closer monitoring.

Medication-Assisted Treatment (MAT) and TRICARE

MAT is a proven, science-backed approach to treating opioid addiction. It combines FDA-approved medications—like buprenorphine (Suboxone), methadone, or naltrexone (Vivitrol)—with counseling and behavioral therapies. MAT reduces cravings, prevents relapse, and supports long-term recovery.

Selecting an in-network provider is key to minimizing out-of-pocket costs and ensuring full coverage under TRICARE.

TRICARE covers MAT, including:

Office visits with a prescribing provider

Medication management

Behavioral health counseling

Urine drug testing as part of treatment monitoring

You’ll need to see a TRICARE-authorized provider and in some cases get pre-authorization. But if MAT is medically necessary TRICARE will likely cover it.

If outpatient care isn’t enough TRICARE also covers residential treatment programs for opioid addiction. Inpatient rehab provides a structured environment with 24/7 care, ideal for individuals with severe addiction, unstable home environments, or co-occurring mental health disorders.

In a residential program you can expect:

Medically supervised detox (if needed)

Individual and group therapy

Trauma-informed care

Life skills training

Relapse prevention planning

TRICARE covers residential treatment when medically necessary and when provided by a TRICARE-authorized facility. Prior authorization is usually required so working with a case manager or treatment coordinator can help streamline the process.

Setting up a payment plan with healthcare providers can help manage expenses not covered by TRICARE insurance.

Outpatient Rehab Options with TRICARE

Not everyone needs to go away for treatment. Physical health complications can hinder veterans’ ability to participate effectively in traditional treatment programs, highlighting the need for tailored approaches. Many individuals succeed with outpatient opioid rehab and TRICARE offers several levels of care, including bother inpatient and outpatient treatment programs.

Partial Hospitalization Programs (PHP)

PHPs provide intensive, structured care during the day, usually 5–7 days a week while allowing patients to return home in the evenings. It’s a good middle ground for those who need more than standard outpatient care but don’t require 24/7 supervision.

Intensive Outpatient Programs (IOP)

IOPs typically involve 9–15 hours of therapy per week, offering flexibility for people who have work or family commitments. TRICARE covers IOPs for opioid addiction when medically necessary.

Standard Outpatient Therapy

This is the least intensive level of care and may include weekly therapy sessions, medication management, and ongoing support. It’s often used as a step-down from more intensive programs or for people in long-term recovery.",https://tricarerehabs.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/TRICARE-Opioid-Rehab.webp,N,1.0,2025-04-02 17:56:21.499339

Zynex, Inc. (ZYXI) Securities Class Action:

The litigation is focused on the propriety of Zynex's statements about its sales and billing practices, its revenue recognition practices, and its relationship with the military health program for active-duty soldiers and their family members (""Tricare""), which represents 20 – 25% of company's revenue.

The complaint alleges that Zynex made false and misleading statements while failing to disclose crucial information to investors. More specifically, the suit alleges that:

Zynex shipped product, including electrodes, in excess of customers' needs;

As a result of this practice, Zynex inflated its revenues;

Zynex's practice of filing false claims drew scrutiny from insurers, including Tricare; and

As a. result, it was reasonably likely that Zynex would face adverse consequences such as removal from insurer networks and penalties by the federal government.

Investors began to learn the truth on June 4, 2024, when medical journal STAAT published ""How a device maker inundated pain patients with unwanted batteries and surprise bills."" This report claimed that Zynex engaged in an ""oversupplying scheme"" by sending inordinate amounts of monthly supplies like electrode pads and batteries in order to ""bill insurers for thousands of dollars more than it otherwise could."" STAAT further revealed that, as a result of this practice, insurers were ""kicking the company out of network.""

Then, on March 11, 2025, Zynex reported dismal Q4 and FY 2024 financial results. The company's Q4 revenue implied a 2% drop from the year-earlier period and YE net income per share plummeted from $0.27 in 2023 to $0.09 in 2024. According to Zynex CEO Thomas Sandgaard ""[o]ur fourth quarter revenue was less than expected[]"" and ""[t]he shortfall was due to slower than normal payments from certain payers and we were recently notified that Tricare has temporarily suspended payments as they review prior claims.""

""We are concerned about potential issues with Zynex's revenue recognition and sales practices,"" said Reed Kathrein, the Hagens Berman Partner leading the firm's probe.

It would require TRICARE, the military's health insurance, to cover infertility diagnosis and treatments, including in vitro fertilization, or IVF.

Congresswoman Sara Jacobs co-authored the act alongside Sen. Tammy Duckworth (D-IL), Sen. Patty Murray (D-WA) and Rep. Rick Larsen (WA-02).

""I froze my eggs very publicly in my first year in Congress, and obviously representing San Diego, I talked to a lot of military families,"" Jacobs said. ""It became very clear to me that this is something that we really need to provide to our military families.""

Statistics from the World Health Organization show the general population has a 17.5% infertility rate. According to Jacobs, about 25% of military families are facing fertility challenges.

""You have these folks who are deployed far away from their families, from their partners. We're often asking them to be doing really dangerous things in dangerous places during their prime reproductive years,"" Jacobs said. ""They're often around chemicals and other things that I'm sure have negative fertility impacts.""

Treatments can be difficult to access through TRICARE. Currently, active duty military must prove their infertility is service-related to receive coverage.

Jacobs said military families are left with few options: forgo having kids, pay tens of thousands of dollars out of pocket or leave the military for a private sector job that covers IVF.

""This would be another incentive to help people want to stay in the military, who are already there, and are serving our country, and also potentially an incentive for folks to join the military,"" Jacobs said.

Jacobs pushed for similar legislation in the past. Last year, a provision to expand TRICARE coverage for IVF was included in the National Defense Authorization Act but was cut from the final version with no explanation why. Jacobs said House Speaker Mike Johnson opposed the legislation.

""We're going to keep pushing again,"" Jacobs said.

Military medicine cutbacks put strain on civilian health care system — as well as service members and retirees

Sitting in the living room of his Silverdale home, wearing a tube in his nostrils, Al Pinkham watches the evening news while recovering from a bad case of flu.

During his 24-year career in the Navy, Pinkham never worried much about health care. He knew that the military would look after him, as well as his wife and children, providing exactly “what a sailor needed” to focus during long deployments.

Yet as a retiree, Pinkham, 78, has almost no relationship with the military health system he once relied on. His latest illness was treated at St. Michael Medical Center in Silverdale. He no longer goes to Naval Hospital Bremerton, a once-thriving military hospital that has served the West Sound in some form for over a century.

Retirees forced out of military system

Over the last decade, the hospital has been gutted, leaving a major gap in the local health care sector and bogging down local providers. As military retirees and beneficiaries are forced out of the military system, they increasingly find themselves searching for care in an overburdened civilian sector desperately short on providers and struggling to provide access to routine care.

And there remains little sign the bleeding will stop soon. Earlier this year, the hospital announced it was transfering nearly 700 internal medicine clinic patients, who are mostly retirees, to civilian providers amid staffing shortages. The decision raises questions about exactly what primary care services are left at the hospital.

A spokesperson for the hospital did not make a member of its leadership available for an interview to discuss staffing levels, despite multiple requests over the last month. A list of questions sent over email also went unanswered by press time Tuesday.

“This downsize is part of a continuous trend in the declining quality of care at [Naval Hospital Bremerton],” Sen. Patty Murray, D-Washington, wrote in a letter following news of the Internalist clinic. Murray went on to say that the hospital has continued to experience staffing shortages but outlined no plans to address them. She also questioned the given reasons for those shortages.

“This pattern of declining care and personnel mismanagement at one of the largest Naval bases in the nation suggests a lack of attention to the healthcare needs of servicemembers, veterans, and their families in Kitsap County,” she wrote.

‘Should not have been a surprise’

Retired Air Force officer Jim Chapin was at the Jan. 31 town hall when officials at Naval Hospital Bremerton announced it would be transferring patients from its Internal Medicine Clinic to providers in the community. In a new release, the hospital said retirements and permanent change-of-duty orders had left them only one physician for over 2,000 patients.

“We did not make this decision lightly,” Capt. Molly Jenkins, the hospital’s executive officer, said during the town hall, according to the release. We “have been studying this issue for months.”

Standing in the hospital’s cafeteria, filled with “an awful lot of old people,” Chapin said that announcement “should not have been a surprise to anybody.” Over the last several years “it’s been quite obvious that there were not enough naval doctors.”

When Chapin and his wife, who live in Bremerton, first started going to the hospital about 16 years ago, it was often so busy in the morning you would have to park down by the water on Ostrich Bay. In the last five years or so, he has always been able to park right out front.

“I talked to some of the people I knew at the hospital. They said ‘they’re just cutting back because they don’t have the personal,” he said.

Shortages in civilian system

Both Chapin and his wife still use the hospital’s urgent care and pharmacy, but after the latest cut no longer have a primary doctor there.

Patients were offered help every Tuesday morning at the hospital to search for a new doctor. That could be tough for some. Kitsap County has a shortage of primary care providers, with about half as many per capita as the state average in 2023, according to Washington Health Care Research Center

Chapin was able to find primary care at the Veterans Affairs Clinic in Silverdale. But his wife, who is ineligible for VA care, is still looking for a new physician.

“It’s easy for me,” he said of the search. “For my wife, she can’t get VA benefits. She has to find a doctor she wants to go to. And as I’ve said, we’ve always relied on the Navy for the last 16 years.”

Budget cuts and military readiness

Reductions at Naval Hospital Bremerton over the last decade come as the Department of Defense has reduced spending on health care. As part of a major realignment designed to shed costs, it has prioritized operational readiness for wartime missions and care for those on active duty over that of beneficiaries and retirees.

The military health system has faced mounting financial pressure over the last two decades after expanding benefits to retirees and increased demand from two wars, Dr. Terry Adirim, a former assistant secretary of defense for health affairs, wrote in a 2019 report. That caused Department of Defense spending on health care to more than double during the 2000s.

By 2010, then-Defense Secretary Robert Gates remarked that health care costs were “eating the [DoD] alive,” and urged officials to find cuts and redirect savings to combat forces. Several initiatives helped reign in spending, including formation of the The Defense Health Agency.

Launched in 2013, the agency was first created to manage services shared between the Army, Navy and Air Force. Military health has been historically fragmented, with each branch operating its own facilities. Establishing a single agency was thought to be the best strategy to sustain combat readiness while reducing costs and increasing efficiency of federal spending.

Congress directed the DoD in 2017 to consolidate administration of its health care facilities of the three branches under the control of the Defense Health Agency. At the same time, the DoD announced plans to move nearly 2 million beneficiaries into the civilian health system.

Naval Hospital reductions

Exactly how this federal restructuring has directly impacted Naval Hospital Bremerton is unclear. But the hospital lost or reduced many of its services since the Defense Health Agency was created.

Naval Hospital Bremerton shuttered its 24/7 emergency room in 2013, replacing it with an urgent care that now opens just eight hours on weekdays. The hospital – which once delivered a quarter of Kitsap’s children – also put its labor and delivery services on divert status in 2022.

Dr. Gib Morrow, Kitsap County’s top public health official, said the community had seen “first-hand” the impact of the Defense Health Agency. Since its formation, the naval hospital has experienced closures of inpatient, emergency, critical and obstetric services, he said during a meeting last year.

In an email to the Kitsap Sun last month, Morrow wrote that the “The Kitsap Public Health Board has advocated for strengthening the military healthcare workforce and services available in Washington state and specifically at Naval Hospital Bremerton.”

In a joint letter the health board sent to DoD leaders last May, they wrote that care shortages left the “community, including those employed by and affiliated with the Department of Defense, face[ing] an ongoing health crisis.”

Caring for beneficiaries

Civilian providers say they are increasingly shouldering the load left by the Navy. The result is worse access across the board for primary, maternal and speciality care for all residents, including those not connected to the military. Shortages are driving up hospital bills, as more people depend on emergent care, and likely leading to worse outcomes for Kitsap patients.

Virginia Mason Franciscan Health, which operates St. Michael Medical Center in Silverdale and St. Anthony Hospital in Gig Harbor, has seen “increased demand as military health care facilities have adjusted their offerings over the years,” St Micheal President Chad Melton wrote in an email.

Peninsula Community Health Services, a federally designated community health center serving the Peninsula, found a nearly 40% increase in the number of self-identified veterans at its clinics between 2023 and 2024, according to agency CEO Jennifer Kreidler-Moss.

Until the last 20 years or so, if you had TRICARE — health insurance for military members and their families — you went to the military hospital for care, said Kreidler-Moss, who is a beneficiary of military insurance. That was how it worked.

“That is definitely not the case anymore,” she said. “Now you know you are going to seek care in the community.”

TRICARE clashes with civilian system

Civilian providers often have a hard time treating patients on TRICARE effectively, because they need prior authorization for most treatments. That means doctors are often forced to look at their patients in a vacuum and offer substandard care.

“This is a regular dilemma. A patient will come in for hypertension that they have authorization for,” Kreidler-Moss said. “If during that visit because they have lab work, [and] our provider figures out that they also have diabetes, we don’t get paid for the visit if we bill for diabetes and not what their conditions were . . . which is just not how medicine works.”

VMFH and the Kitsap Public Health District say they have an ongoing relationship with the Navy. But Kreidler-Moss said PCHS gets no advanced warning when a carrier is coming or going, which can have a large sway on health care demand.

A few decades ago, when an aircraft carrier arrived into Bremerton, both its active-duty members and their beneficiaries were sufficiently cared for by the military system. Today, many of those beneficiaries cannot get care at Naval Hospital Bremerton, Kreidler-Moss said. Local providers see a sudden and often unexpected increase in demand that can be difficult to staff for.

“The Navy tends to say the carrier takes care of itself, because it has its own health care,” she said. “That’s true for active duty people. It’s not true for the surge who come with the carrier.”

Professional service

Chapin, the retired Air Force officer, said doctors at the naval hospital have always been professional. He credits the physician there for seeing a sign of testicular cancer and referring him to a urologist that prevented it from spreading.

“If it wasn’t for that Navy Doctor telling me that maybe I had a problem I would’ve never known,” he said. “The [civilian] urologist just kept saying I don’t understand why you’re here. You have no symptoms.”

Pinkham, the Navy retiree, insists, even amid the reductions, he doesn’t want to “bad mouth” the Navy. He does not go to Naval Hospital Bremerton anymore, but the providers have always delivered good service. And, more importantly, his wife is alive today because of Navy doctors, he said.

Still, he agrees Navy medicine used to be simpler; easier to access, but states plainly that “things have changed.”

“Medicine is different now,” he said. “The Navy is different now.”",https://www.gigharbornow.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/NHB_Pinkham-1-1200x630.jpg,N,0.0,2025-04-01 19:56:21.295260

Covered services

You can use online visits for many types of care. These include:

Primary care, including on-demand non-emergency care

Preventive care

Telemental health care

Specialty care

Remote monitoring for serious chronic conditions

Before you book a virtual health visit, call or visit your regional contractor’s web page. Some types of care need a referral or pre-authorization.

Do you get your care at a military hospital or clinic? Many of these virtual health services may be available there. Contact your provider for more information. If you’re an active duty service member, you need a referral and pre-authorization from your primary care manager for virtual health care.

As described in the TRICARE Mental Health and Substance Use Disorder Services Fact Sheet, virtual mental health services have the same referrals and pre-authorization requirements as your in-person mental health care.

Costs

Virtual health costs are similar to in-person costs. Your costs depend on who you are, health plan, and type of appointment. Note that you’ll need to pay your usual cost-shares and copayments for virtual visits.

What you need

To use virtual health services, you need:

A computer or smartphone (for video care)

A telephone (for telephone-only care)

A secure phone or internet connection

Referrals or pre-authorizations (if required)

Overseas

Do you live outside the United States? You can still use virtual health services if:

The care is a TRICARE-covered benefit and is appropriate for virtual health.

The country where you receive care allows virtual health.

The provider is licensed and TRICARE-authorized and has a license to practice in the country where you receive care.

The provider knows your location and how to contact help in a medical or mental health emergency.

The provider follows all local healthcare and virtual health rules.

TRICARE will cover your virtual health care if you meet these requirements.

TRICARE For Life and Medicare

Do you have TRICARE For Life? Medicare usually pays first for virtual visits. This includes phone calls with your doctor. Remember to check what Medicare and TRICARE cover before scheduling an appointment. TRICARE pays first if Medicare doesn’t cover a service.

Autism Care Demonstration

TRICARE covers services for parents of children with autism. This includes applied behavior analysis guidance. These services are under the Autism Care Demonstration.

Want to learn more about virtual health coverage? Contact your TRICARE regional contractor or visit tricare.mil. Medicare members can also check Medicare.gov for additional details about their coverage.

We know so many military families are struggling to make ends meet as it is and are facing really significant fertility challenges.
One of the biggest concerns surrounding the addition of in vitro fertilization for military members should be no surprise—cost.","Using TRICARE to cover healthcare expenses is an integral part of military life, but it’s falling short for many warfighters. Military in vitro fertilization (IVF) treatment isn’t covered, but there are politicians working to change this for service members and their families.

Does the Military Pay for In Vitro Fertilization?

TRICARE doesn’t cover Assisted Reproductive Technology (ART) services like IUI, IVF, or cryopreservation. However, in 2024, a new Defense Department policy expanded fertility treatment eligibility to unmarried service members and those needing donor eggs or sperm.

Previously, these benefits were limited to certain married service members, with policies excluding same-sex couples.

Even though new measures have improved access, ART services still aren’t fully covered, so those seeking treatment may need to explore other options for financial support.

This is why there’s still a push to do more for service members seeking IVF treatments as a viable option for starting their families.

Democrats Pushing for IVF Coverage for Military Members

Congressional Democrats are pushing to expand IVF access for military service members by introducing legislation that would require TRICARE to cover the procedure.

Led by Sen. Tammy Duckworth (D-IL) and Rep. Sara Jacobs (D-CA), the bill aims to match the fertility benefits available to Congress members and remove the requirement that infertility be directly linked to military service.

Supporters say that having the military cover in vitro fertilization could be life-changing, allowing service members to grow their families without sacrificing their careers.

“I think it will be huge. We know so many military families are struggling to make ends meet as it is and are facing really significant fertility challenges. It would be life-changing. We shouldn't make them choose between serving our country and building their families,” said Rep. Jacobs.

Sen. Duckworth understands the plight of warfighters and IVF treatments as an Iraq War Veteran. She has been open about the use of these healthcare options when conceiving her two children.

President Donald Trump spoke positively of IVF treatment while campaigning and the idea is that now there could be more support for a bipartisan approach.

“President Trump pledged to voters on the campaign trail that he would go even further by making IVF free if elected and has repeated the bold-faced lie that he is governing on the principle of ‘promises made, promises kept.’ Republicans can now help him partially fulfill his broken IVF promise by joining our commonsense legislation that would make sure those who answer the call to serve have access to the care they need to build their family,” said Duckworth through a statement.

IVF Could Help Military Families Grow

The unfortunate reality is that while warfighters have a duty to our nation, they’re often forced to choose between defending our nation and starting a family.

Because of the difficulties involving IVF and getting TRICARE to pay for it, there are worries that operational readiness is being affected.

“For too many service members, the lack of TRICARE coverage of IVF has left them with only a few choices: beat the odds and prove that their infertility is directly related to their service, pay tens of thousands of dollars out-of-pocket for a chance at a family, forgo having children, or leave the military. This is wrong,” said Jacobs.

Besides just helping warfighters and their families by providing this benefit, proponents are also arguing the logical side of things, as Congress members are now allowed to have their infertility treatments covered.

“It makes no sense that members of Congress and the rest of the federal workforce will get this, but military families still won't,” said Jacobs.

Efforts Have Been Ongoing

This isn’t the first time the Democratic lawmakers have worked on this initiative.

In 2024, Sen. Duckworth and Rep. Jacobs worked together on an IVF proposal for military members that made it through the House Armed Services Committee but failed to make the final defense bill.

Duckworth herself has faced multiple blocks from the Republican Party while championing such initiatives.

One of the biggest concerns surrounding the addition of in vitro fertilization for military members should be no surprise—cost.

The added expense is what caused Sen. James Lankford (R-OK) to block a similar measure aiming to provide this healthcare to warfighters.

Now, the duo is trying again with a standalone bill, giving it a fresh chance for approval, but despite some hope of bipartisan support due to President Trump’s comments, military IVF coverage is still an uphill battle.

The Politics of TRICARE Covering In Vitro Fertilization for the Military

There may be strong supporters on the Democratic side of things but if a change to TRICARE is going to become a reality, the Republicans will need to get on board.

Unfortunately, as of this writing, there have been no Republicans who have cosponsored the bill brought up by Duckworth and Jacobs.

There’s still hope as Trump has called himself the “father of IVF,” stating that he “strongly support(s) the availability of IVF for couples who are trying to have a precious baby.”

“Fertilization. I'm still very proud of it, I don't care. I'll be known as the fertilization President, and that's OK. That's not bad. I've been called much worse. Actually, I like it, right?” said President Trump.

Regardless of which bill or method is successful, providing military members with TRICARE coverage for in vitro fertilization is an important initiative that could help the community overcome a sensitive matter with the dignity and resources they deserve.

Tricare is here to take care of your family, wherever military life takes you.","Tricare is one of the biggest perks of military life, but most people don’t realize how much better it works when you know the system inside and out. Spouses who get the best care aren’t just lucky. They know exactly how to navigate Tricare’s red tape, avoid common delays, and use benefits most people ignore.

If you’re only using Tricare at the bare minimum, you’re leaving benefits (and convenience) on the table.

Here’s how to use Tricare like an expert so you get the care you need, when you need it, without the usual headaches:

Picture this: You’re at a pharmacy picking up a prescription, and suddenly, you’re told your Tricare isn’t active. Stressful, right? The problem usually comes down to outdated records in the Defense Enrollment Eligibility Reporting System (DEERS)—the database that keeps your Tricare access running smoothly. If your information isn’t correct, you could find yourself without coverage at the worst possible time.

Log into MilConnect today and check your DEERS info. If anything looks off, fix it now. Don’t wait until you’re at the doctor’s office scrambling to correct an error. Moved recently? Had a baby? Got married? Every major life change means an update to DEERS. The sooner you do it, the fewer problems you’ll run into when you need care.

Choose the right Tricare plan for your needs

It’s important to remember this isn’t a one-size-fits-all solution. The best plan for you depends on how much flexibility and control you want over your care.

If you want zero out-of-pocket costs and don’t mind going through a Primary Care Manager (PCM), Tricare Prime is your best bet. You’ll need referrals for specialists, but everything is covered, and there are no surprise medical bills. This is ideal for families who live near a military treatment facility and prefer a structured, managed approach to healthcare.

Prefer to choose your own doctors and avoid waiting on referrals? Tricare Select gives you full control. You’ll pay an annual deductible and co-pays per visit, but you can see any Tricare-authorized provider without permission from a PCM. This is a better option for those who need regular specialist care or live far from a military base.

If your spouse is in the Guard or Reserve and not on active orders, Tricare Reserve Select is the plan you need. It functions just like Tricare Select but must be purchased separately with monthly premiums. Many families assume they’re covered automatically—don’t make that mistake. If you’re in this category, make sure your enrollment is squared away before you need medical care.

For retirees, Tricare for Life is one of the best benefits you’ll ever have. It covers everything Medicare doesn’t, with no enrollment fees beyond signing up for Medicare Part B. Just make sure you enroll in Medicare on time to keep your Tricare benefits intact.

Use the benefits most people ignore

Most military spouses only use Tricare for routine doctor’s visits, but those who know the system well take advantage of benefits that make life easier.

Instead of rushing to the ER when a medical issue pops up in the middle of the night, call Nurse Advice Line. It’s open 24/7 and connects you with a registered nurse who can assess your symptoms and tell you whether you should go to urgent care, book an appointment, or treat symptoms at home.

Need regular prescriptions? Military treatment facilities offer 100% free prescriptions, but standing in long pharmacy lines isn’t ideal. Skip the wait by signing up for Tricare Express Scripts home delivery, which ships medications straight to your door for free.

If you need a specialist, don’t waste time calling around—use the Tricare Provider Directory to find in-network doctors. Some providers say they “take Tricare,” but that doesn’t mean they accept Tricare’s payment structure. Always double-check before scheduling an appointment to avoid unexpected bills.

Avoid common mistakes that cause delays

Even with great coverage, Tricare can be frustrating if you don’t know how to avoid common pitfalls.

Many spouses don’t realize that if you move and don’t update DEERS, your claims might get denied. Tricare ties coverage to your registered address, so failing to update it can result in problems when you seek care in a new location.

Tricare Prime users often get tripped up by booking a specialist without a referral. If you see a doctor without the proper authorization, Tricare won’t pay for it. Always go through your PCM first to avoid footing the bill yourself.

Another mistake? Assuming all civilian providers who “take Tricare” accept Tricare’s payment rates. Some doctors will accept Tricare but bill you extra because they don’t adhere to Tricare’s approved payment amounts. Use the Tricare Provider Directory to confirm that a provider is fully in-network before making an appointment.

It’s so easy to use Tricare to your advantage

Military spouses have access to some of the best healthcare coverage available, but those who get the most out of it know how to work the system to their advantage.

Stay on top of your DEERS updates. Choose the plan that best suits your needs. Use the lesser-known benefits that save time and hassle. And most importantly, avoid the common mistakes that slow everything down.

The legislative effort, being led in the Senate by Democratic Sen. Tammy Duckworth and in the House by Democratic Rep. Sara Jacobs, would bring IVF access afforded to military service members in parity with the services available to members of Congress. It would also modify current requirements that service members prove that their infertility challenges are directly connected to service, a barrier that the lawmakers say is often cumbersome or impossible to overcome.

The legislation, Jacobs said in an exclusive interview with ABC News, could be “life-changing” for military service members who are often forced to choose between continuing their military service and starting a family.

“I think it will be huge. We know so many military families are struggling to make ends meet as it is, and are facing really significant fertility challenges. It would be life-changing,” Jacobs told ABC News. “We shouldn’t make them choose between serving our country and building their families.”

Duckworth and Jacobs say that some members of the military have been forced to abandon their military careers because of the lack of infertility treatment coverage by their health care program, called TRICARE. It could present a risk to military readiness, they told ABC News.

“For too many service members, the lack of TRICARE coverage of IVF has left them with only a few choices: beat the odds and prove that their infertility is directly related to their service, pay tens of thousands of dollars out-of-pocket for a chance at a family, forgo having children, or leave the military. This is wrong,” Duckworth said.

It’s also about parity, they said: Starting this year, members of Congress are afforded access to plans that offer coverage for infertility treatments. Jacobs and Duckworth say the same should be true for military service members.

“It makes no sense that members of Congress and the rest of the federal workforce will get this, but military families still won’t,” Jacobs said.

This is not the first time that Jacobs and Duckworth have attempted to expand IVF access for military service members. They tried to get this same provision included in the massive military spending package, known as the National Defense Authorization Act, last year as both parties tried to reassure voters of their support for IVF and other infertility treatments.

Though the proposal made it through the House Armed Services Committee, it never made it into the final version of the bill that President Joe Biden signed into law during the waning days of his presidency.

Similar legislation was separately blocked in the Senate by Republican Sen. James Lankford last year. At the time, Lankford said that while he supports IVF, he was concerned about the indefinite cost of the legislation and the possibility it opened for “future definitions for gene editing or for cloning.”

Duckworth and Jacobs’ newest effort, however, is a stand-alone bill that could be voted on not as an amendment, but as it’s own legislation.

Duckworth, an Iraq War veteran, has been vocal about her own experiences using IVF to conceive her two children. She was involved in multiple efforts to expand IVF access last Congress that were ultimately blocked by Republicans.

She said this new proposal would give Republicans the opportunity to make good on President Donald Trump’s pro-IVF rhetoric that he’s used on the campaign trail and at the White House.

“President Trump pledged to voters on the campaign trail that he would go even further by making IVF free if elected and has repeated the bold-faced lie that he is governing on the principle of ‘promises made, promises kept,'” Duckworth said in a statement. “Republicans can now help him partially fulfill his broken IVF promise by joining our commonsense legislation that would make sure those who answer the call to serve have access to the care they need to build their family.”

No Republican has yet signed on as a cosponsor, but Duckworth and Jacobs are pointing to Trump’s comments as recently as last week touting his support for IVF as a possible boon to their efforts.

On the campaign trail, as an Alabama State Supreme Court ruling temporarily threw IVF access into question, Trump was vocal about his hope to make IVF continually accessible. He referred to himself as the “father of IVF” and issued a statement that said “I strongly support the availability of IVF for couples who are trying to have a precious baby.”

Trump has continued to make his support for IVF known. As recently as Wednesday when, during a Women’s History Month event, he referred to himself as the “fertilization president.”

“Fertilization. I’m still very proud of it, I don’t care. I’ll be known as the fertilization president, and that’s OK,” Trump said. “That’s not bad. I’ve been called much worse. Actually, I like it, right?”

It’s at this point unclear if the bill, which if pushed by Democrats to the Senate floor as a stand-alone bill would require the unanimous support of the Republican conference, would have the support it needs to pass. It’s also unclear if efforts to include it in this year’s National Defense Authorization Act or other major legislative pushes could lead to passage.

The California Medical Association (CMA) released its sponsored bill package for the 2025 legislative session. The seven-bill package tackles issues relating to bureaucratic delays in providing care, private equity’s influence on medicine, the use of artificial intelligence in health care, and increasing the physician workforce.

“CMA is advancing bold solutions that protect patients and prioritize their care,” said CMA President Shannon Udovic-Constant, M.D. “We are taking a strong stand against private equity’s profit-driven interference in medicine and pushing to end bureaucratic delays that harm patients. Our proactive approach to regulating artificial intelligence ensures that technology supports, rather than replaces, physician decision-making. We are driving change to ensure that patients always come first in our health care system.”

The bills in CMA’s sponsored bill package include:

SB 351 by Senator Christopher Cabaldon (SD 3): Private equity firms are gaining influence in our health care system, leading to rising costs and undermining the quality of care. SB 351 empowers the Attorney General to hold private equity groups accountable for interfering with the practice of medicine, allowing the Attorney General to investigate and take action against private equity firms that unlawfully interfere in the patient-physician relationship. The goal is to restore trust in the health care system, ensuring that medical decisions are made in the best interest of patients, not financial shareholders.

AB 489 by Assemblymember Mia Bonta (AD 18): While AI can be a useful tool in health care, it should not replace physician decision making. This bill would ban companies from marketing artificial intelligence (AI) chatbots as licensed medical professionals.

AB 967 by Assemblymember Avelino Valencia (AD 68): California is facing a physician shortage, leaving millions of residents waiting weeks and months to get critical care. This bill will streamline the process for licensing out-of-state physicians looking to practice in California.

Additionally, CMA is sponsoring a bill package entitled “Prioritizing Patients, Empowering Physicians” to cut bureaucracy in the health system that harms patients and delays the ability to provide care. The red tape, called prior authorization, has been shown to unnecessarily delay care and lead to serious adverse events such as hospitalizations, permanent bodily damage and even death. The Prioritizing Patients, Empowering Physicians package includes:

AB 510 by Assemblymember Dawn Addis (AD 30): Requires that appeals of prior authorization denials be performed by a provider of the same or similar specialty. This will help ensure that providers can discuss prior authorization denials with a professional peer who understands the recommended treatment and underlying condition.

AB 539 by Assemblymember Pilar Schiavo (AD 40): Extends the validity of an approved prior authorization to one year (current industry standard is 60 to 90 days). This will provide patients with a longer window of time to receive medically necessary care and avoid the cumbersome prior authorization review and appeal processes.

AB 512 by Assemblymember John Harabedian (AD 41): Requires health plans to respond to urgent prior authorization requests within 24 hours and respond to nonurgent requests within 48 hours. Currently, health plans have 72 hours for urgent requests and five days for nonurgent requests. This change will ensure more patients can receive care or appeal denials in a timely fashion.

SB 306 Senator Josh Becker (SD 13): Requires health plans to remove the requirement for prior authorization from any service that they approve more than 90% of the time. This will reduce the overall volume of prior authorization requests and ensure that patients can receive the care they need with minimal delay and physicians can spend more time focusing on patient care.

CMA thanks our partners in the Assembly and Senate for championing legislation to improve the quality, integrity and accessibility of our health care system.

Military public health experts who have monitored the occurrence of eye injuries among active-duty personnel say the numbers have continued to go down over the years.

U.S. Army Col. Mark Reynolds, ophthalmologist and chief of the Clinical Public Health and Epidemiology Directorate at Defense Health Agency-Public Health in Aberdeen, Maryland, has reported on these trends and supervised the monitoring of eye injury data throughout the pandemic.

Reynolds says the decline in eye injuries is in large part due to the Department of Defense’s successful efforts to ensure that service members use only the commercial protective eyewear identified in the Authorized Protective Eyewear List, known as APEL, during training and in combat.

“Unfortunately, eye injuries also occur during service members’ recreational activities such as when they play sports,” says U.S. Army Maj. John Koehler, optometrist and chief of DHA’s Tri-Service Vision Conservation and Readiness Branch at Aberdeen.

Sports activity injuries are also reflected in DHA’s annual military injury surveillance data.

“The DHA’s latest annual military injury surveillance data from 2021 showed that active-duty personnel required treatment for 13,635 eye injuries,” says Anna Renner, a senior CPHE injury prevention surveillance data analyst. “Of the medical records that indicated a cause, a quarter described a sports activity.”

“The sport reported to have caused the most eye injuries was basketball,” says Renner. “This was followed by martial arts and then tackle football. Soccer and wrestling were next.”

Basketball, football, and soccer are also consistent with sports identified by the National Eye Institute, or NEI, as having high and moderate eye injury risk.

“Eye injuries from participating in sports include corneal abrasions, blunt trauma, and penetrating eye injuries. Many eye injuries are temporary, but more severe eye injuries also occur. Some damage may even be permanent or result in blindness,” says U.S. Navy Capt. Kyle Dohm, an optometrist with DHA TSVCRB.

“All it takes is a random elbow or swipe of a fingernail across the eye during that platoon basketball tournament to take you out of the action and lead to days or weeks of limited duty,” Dohm says.

Does sports eye protection work?

According to the NEI, wearing the appropriate eye protection can prevent the majority of sports-related eye injuries.

As an example of effective injury prevention, in his 2000 American Society of Testing and Materials International, or ASTM, paper entitled, “Is the Facemask Good for Hockey?”, Dr. Paul F. Vinger, a Rutgers New Jersey Medical School graduate and practicing ophthalmologist in New Jersey, wrote:

“The ice hockey face protector is…extremely effective…Ice hockey face protectors prevent over 70,000 eye and face injuries a year with a savings...of over $10 million each year in the United States. No blinding eye injuries have been reported in any player...wearing an approved full-face protector while playing ice hockey. The success of the hockey face mask stems from the studied, deliberate process involved in the evaluation of the mechanisms of hockey injury and their means of prevention.”

The materials used in eye protection have been studied as well.

“Evidence has found that as much as 9 to10 times more energy was required to shatter a polycarbonate lens than other lens types, so polycarbonate material is recommended for impact resistance,” says U.S. Air Force Maj. Chen Yang, a DHA TSVCRB optometrist.

While the military’s APEL is not intended for individual sports, the ASTM has developed specific eye protective standard specifications for different sports. The ASTM standards are used when protective equipment is tested in independent laboratories – the ASTM does not certify specific commercial products.

Sports eye protection meeting an ASTM standard code for a particular sport will display that ASTM standard code or codes on the sports eye protector and/or its packaging. As an example, ASTM code F803-19 is recommended for impact resistance for many sports – though other ASTM standards are also required for certain sport-specific eye protection.

In addition, individual sports organizations have developed requirements and regulations regarding the wearing of eye protective equipment by their respective sport’s participants.

What can you do to reduce your risk of eye injury?

The DHA TSVCRB experts provide the following guidance:

When participating in sports and fitness activities with known eye hazards, people should know what eye protection is most appropriate and should wear it whenever they’re practicing or playing. Some sports protective eyewear can be made to incorporate prescriptions as well.

While the cost of recreational sports eyewear is the user’s responsibility in almost all cases, service members can get advice from their military optometrist or the TSVCRB regarding suitable protective eyewear for a chosen sport.

DHA public health experts remind service members and military athletes to protect their eyes in training, in combat and on the field of play:

• Use the APEL eyewear when you’re in training or performing combat operations.

• Use eyewear protectors meeting ASTM standards for intramural sports and athletic competition.

• Choose eyewear specifically made for your sport, and make sure it fits comfortably on your face.

Regulations that identify requirements in military sports facilities/fields (where service members play basketball, soccer, racquetball, ice hockey, football etc.) vary by service and installation. In most instances, such regulations are at the discretion of the installation commander.

Uniformed Services University cardiologist Dr. Marc Alaric Franzos discusses why you should eat heart healthy and what not to eat, including how to best fuel warfighter performance. Learn about nutrition geared for readiness and how to “look at those foods that can fuel us for the fight,” Franzos says.

Franzos is a retired U.S. Navy captain who flew the P3 Orion early in his career. He became a U.S. Navy physician and a flight surgeon and ultimately specialized in cardiovascular disease and internal medicine. He is an associate professor of medicine at the Department of Defense's premiere medical school. “Picking a diet you like and you can stick with, but that is also somewhat healthy—and will get you to your goals—is really critical,” Franzos said. His top nutritional lifestyle suggestion is the long-popular and varied Mediterranean diet. The diet includes a variety of fruits, vegetables, whole grains, potatoes, beans, nuts, and seeds; olive oil as a primary fat source; and dairy products, eggs, fish, and poultry in low to moderate amounts. It centers on minimally processed, plant-based foods to prevent heart disease and stroke and reduce heart risk factors such as obesity, diabetes, high cholesterol, and high blood pressure.",https://health.mil/-/media/Images/MHS/Video-Thumbnails/Screenshot-20250331-at-24611PM.png,N,0.0,2025-04-01 09:56:18.091043

Work in the private sector is generally more volatile and it is incredible to not be dependent on your employer for healthcare and never having to change plans. Pro-move is to find an employer who pays you for not using their healthcare plan. My wife got something like $1,000/yr bonus from a previous employer. My buddy gets $14,000/yr bonus for using Tricare.

I went reserves when I left AD for grad school, partially for this reason. I would say it's worth it in some contexts, if your civilian job doesn't have very good insurance and you don't mind having a part-time job cutting into your free time, but take a really good look at what's available from your employer. Reserves and NG take more of your free time than advertised, and you're probably in a better place career-wise than you were before you joined.",,N,0.0,2025-04-01 07:56:42.282740
