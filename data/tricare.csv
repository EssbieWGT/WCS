The Defense Health Agency announced Nov. 13 that three military hospitals from Defense Health Network Central earned Leapfrog's Top Hospital recognition for fall 2025.

Bassett Army Community Hospital earned honors for a second year in a row, along with new honors for Osan Air Base's 51st Medical Group and Yokota Air Base's 374th Medical Group.

""Receiving the Leapfrog Top Hospital Award is a remarkable achievement and a testament to DHN Central MTFs’ unwavering commitment to patient safety and the exceptional quality of care you provide to our patients,"" said Maj. Gen. Thomas Harrell, director of Defense Health Network Central. ""This prestigious designation recognizes the outstanding performance in critical areas such as error prevention and superior outcomes, setting these MTFs apart as three of only 12 MTFs across the enterprise to receive the recognition in 2025.”

The Leapfrog Group is a national, independent organization focused on health care quality. The organization evaluates hospitals on a wide range of safety measures, including errors, injuries, and infections, as well as the safety and quality programs in place to prevent patient harm.

Leapfrog's Top Hospital award recognizes the highest-performing hospitals on the Leapfrog Hospital Survey, identifying those with strong performance in patient safety and quality. Hospitals are recognized across four categories: general, teaching, rural, and children's hospitals, and must achieve an ""A"" grade in the Leapfrog Hospital Safety Grade to be eligible. These hospitals demonstrate superior systems for preventing medication errors, higher quality maternity care, and lower infection rates, among other standards, according to the Leapfrog Group’s website.

Bassett Army Community Hospital

This honor marks Bassett's second consecutive year receiving the Top Hospital honor.

""Our team at Bassett Army Community Hospital not only strives to deliver safe, quality care, but we do it the right way – through teamwork, professionalism, and mutual support across sections,"" said Air Force Col. Benjamin Donham, Bassett Army Community Hospital commander.

""Being recognized for earning the Leapfrog Top Hospital for the second year in a row shows the commitment our team has to our community, beneficiaries, and each other.""'

Osan Air Base Hospital

""We are immensely proud that Osan Air Base Hospital is recognized as a Leapfrog Top Hospital. This prestigious designation is a testament to the unwavering dedication and commitment of our entire staff who worked diligently and collaboratively to meet and exceed the stringent national standards,"" said Air Force Col. Amanda L. Siangco, 51st Medical Group director.

""This achievement underscores our ongoing commitment to providing the highest quality and safest care to our patients and the community we serve.""

Yokota Military Hospital

Yokota Military Hospital also made the fall ""honor roll.""

""Yokota Air Base Hospital's prestigious selection as a Leapfrog Top Hospital belongs entirely to its remarkable team,"" said Air Force Col. Graham I. Warden, 474th Medical Group director. ""It was their tireless hard work, seamless collaboration, and relentless pursuit of continuous improvement and the highest standards that made this national recognition possible.""

Along with assessing patient safety measures, Leapfrog participation fosters transparency with patients and the public. Additionally, military hospitals can use the data to measure and compare their performance to other participating hospitals and health care systems, leading to continual process improvement.

“This recognition reflects your tireless efforts, represents the highest standards of excellence, and reflects positively on our entire Network, the Defense Health Agency, and the Military Health System.

Individuals need to be aware of specific dates for the Tricare open season and the Federal Benefits Open Season to make informed decisions regarding their healthcare options.

Tricare Open Season

The Tricare open season will conclude on Tuesday, December 9, at midnight Eastern Standard Time. During this period, beneficiaries have the opportunity to make essential changes to their Tricare healthcare plans, including the option to switch between Tricare Prime and Tricare Select. It is recommended that beneficiaries visit tricare.mil/openseason to compare costs and plans, with online enrollment available through the Beneficiary Web Enrollment portal at milconnect.dmdc.osd.mil.

For those who do not make any changes during this open season, the next opportunity to alter their plan will not occur until next year’s open season or following a qualifying life event, such as a birth. It’s crucial for beneficiaries to verify their information by checking the Defense Enrollment Eligibility Reporting System at tricare.mil/deers.

This year’s open season introduces a notable change for beneficiaries residing in the Atlanta, Georgia, and Tampa, Florida metropolitan areas. A demonstration project will offer a Tricare Prime option without the requirement of referrals to in-network specialists, a significant shift that aims to enhance access to healthcare services. New coverage or changes selected will become effective on January 1, 2026.

The Tricare open season applies to individuals currently enrolled or eligible for various Tricare plans, including Tricare Prime and Tricare Select. Notably, individual active-duty service members and beneficiaries enrolled in Tricare for Life are exempt from this open season, as their coverage is automatically granted for those with Medicare Part A and Part B. Those eligible for premium-based plans like Tricare Reserve Select and Tricare Retired Reserve can enroll at any time throughout the year.

Dental, Vision, and Tax-Saving Accounts

The Federal Benefits Open Season will end on Monday, December 8, at 11:59 p.m. Eastern Standard Time. Eligible military community members can enroll in dental and vision coverage through the Federal Employees Dental and Vision Insurance Program (FEDVIP) at www.benefeds.gov. Additionally, service members can enroll in tax-savings accounts during this period, including a healthcare flexible spending account and a dependent care flexible spending account. These accounts allow individuals to set aside pre-tax dollars for healthcare costs not covered by Tricare and additional expenses associated with child care. It is important to note that previous participation does not automatically carry over, requiring new enrollment each year.

New Tricare Prime Demonstration

Starting in 2026, approximately 150,000 Tricare beneficiaries in the Atlanta and Tampa areas will gain access to the new Tricare Prime demonstration project initiated by the Defense Health Agency. Beneficiaries who wish to participate must enroll during the open season. Further information can be obtained by visiting enrolltricare.com or by calling 877-996-9333.

The CareSource Military and Veterans Company, based in Dayton, Ohio, will manage the three-year demonstration project under contracts totaling $110 million. This initiative will serve active-duty family members, family members of activated National Guard or Reserve members, retirees, and certain other individuals not eligible for Medicare. A key benefit of this new option is the elimination of referral requirements for in-network specialty care.

Feedback from beneficiaries regarding the Tricare Prime demonstration has been largely positive, particularly concerning the new allowance to access specialists without referrals. CareSource aims to provide robust support, helping families navigate healthcare options and appointments.

For military families seeking to optimize their healthcare coverage for the upcoming year, adhering to these deadlines and exploring the available options is essential for ensuring comprehensive and accessible medical services.",https://news.ssbcrack.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Upcoming-Health-Care-Enrollment-Deadlines-for-US-Military-Community.jpg,N,0.0,2025-12-05 13:56:47.208840

Clear and dependable communication is essential for military families stationed abroad,” said Congressman Bacon.
“Our military readiness depends upon our operational readiness, and this commonsense bipartisan bill will strengthen both.” “When military families receive the right information at the right time, they stay resilient, informed, and mission ready,” Rep. Horsford said.
I’m proud to partner with Representatives Houlahan, Bacon, Kiggans, Goodlander and Wittman to help give military families the consistent, direct, and timely communication they deserve.” “Ensuring that our service members have access to reliable, consistent communication is essential for military readiness.
For those stationed in Okinawa, timely updates can make all the difference in their day-to-day lives and provide stability for their families.","WASHINGTON, D.C. — Today, Representatives Chrissy Houlahan (D-PA) and Jen Kiggans (R-VA), along with original co-sponsors Representatives Steven Horsford (D-NV), Maggie Goodlander (D-NH), Don Bacon (R-NE), and Rob Wittman (R-VA), introduced the Improving Notification for Operational Readiness and Families (INFORM) Act, a bipartisan bill directing the Department of Defense (DoD) to establish a pilot program to deliver timely, mission-critical information directly to servicemembers and military families stationed at Marine Corps Installations Pacific in Okinawa, Japan.

Under the bill, DoD will automatically enroll eligible servicemembers and adult dependents to receive text messages providing updates on spouse employment opportunities, childcare availability, TRICARE benefits, and Department-wide policy changes. The initiative, which provides the option to opt out, aims to streamline communication and reduce reliance on fragmented channels such as social media, newsletters, and installation-specific platforms.

The bill also directs DoD to report to Congress by October 1, 2027, on participation, outcomes, costs, and whether the program should be expanded Department-wide. By consolidating routine updates into a single, efficient push-text system, the initiative is expected to reduce duplicative outreach efforts and improve long-term communication efficiency.

“Military families deserve clear, consistent, and reliable communication, especially those stationed overseas,” said Representative Chrissy Houlahan. “Our bill ensures that servicemembers and their families on Okinawa get the information they need directly to their phones, without having to dig through multiple systems or outdated channels. As a former Air Force officer and daughter of a naval officer, I know how much this simple, modern approach to getting timely information can improve quality of life and readiness.”

""Having served overseas with my own family, I know firsthand that clear and timely communication can make all the difference. Whether it’s childcare availability, TRICARE updates, or family resources, our servicemembers stationed in Okinawa deserve information they can rely on. The Push-Text Initiative will deliver that support directly to their phones, strengthening both family stability and mission readiness,” said Congresswoman Kiggans.

“Our servicemembers and their families are relying on increasingly diverse sources of information, and they deserve to be met where they are at. Clear and dependable communication is essential for military families stationed abroad,” said Congressman Bacon. “I’m pleased to co-lead the INFORM Act with Rep. Houlahan, to establish a DoD pilot delivering timely and relevant text updates to servicemembers and dependents in Okinawa. I am hopeful that the success of this program will lead to adoption across the force.”

“When America’s servicemembers answer the call to serve our country overseas, military families serve right alongside them. They need and deserve clear, reliable communication they can count on, especially when they are thousands of miles from home,” said Congresswoman Maggie Goodlander. “Our military readiness depends upon our operational readiness, and this commonsense bipartisan bill will strengthen both.”

“When military families receive the right information at the right time, they stay resilient, informed, and mission ready,” Rep. Horsford said. “If we can track flights, packages, and banking in real time, families should be able to track TRICARE deadlines and childcare openings just as easily. The pilot program we’re proposing today does just that, proving that smart, modern communication doesn’t have to be complicated, and that small changes can have big quality-of-life benefits for service members and their families. I’m proud to partner with Representatives Houlahan, Bacon, Kiggans, Goodlander and Wittman to help give military families the consistent, direct, and timely communication they deserve.”

“Ensuring that our service members have access to reliable, consistent communication is essential for military readiness. For those stationed in Okinawa, timely updates can make all the difference in their day-to-day lives and provide stability for their families. I’m proud to cosponsor the INFORM Act, which will ensure that the brave men and women serving our nation, as well as their families, have access to the resources they need to stay informed and connected,” said Congressman Wittman.

The proposal also carries significant national security implications. During major contingency scenarios, such as a crisis involving China, commercial communications systems in Okinawa could be disrupted. By building a controlled, state-side-managed communications capability, the bill lays the groundwork for a more resilient information pipeline that can operate even if local infrastructure is compromised. “This bipartisan pilot is a crucial step toward making sure no family is left without critical updates when it matters most. That’s not just good communication policy, its readiness,” Representative Chrissy Houlahan said.

During that period, CVS pharmacies: Dispensed quantities of insulin exceeding prescription directions.
DCIS Acting Special Agent in Charge Christopher M. Silvestro reaffirmed that investigating false claims against TRICARE remains a top priority.
Resolution and Oversight As part of the settlement, CVS admitted to the conduct alleged in the government’s complaint and accepted responsibility.
In addition to the government’s complaint, five private whistleblower lawsuits were joined under the False Claims Act.","The US Attorney’s Office for the Southern District of New York has announced a $37.76 million settlement with CVS Pharmacy, Inc. to resolve allegations that the company violated the False Claims Act by over-dispensing insulin pens and improperly billing federal health care programs.

The settlement, approved by US District Judge John G. Koeltl, includes $24.4 million to be paid to the United States, with the remaining funds distributed to participating states.

CVS admitted to dispensing more insulin to patients than prescribed, submitting premature refill claims, and under-reporting days-of-supply data to secure reimbursements from Medicare, Medicaid, TRICARE, and the Federal Employees Health Benefits Program.

Findings and Admissions

According to the US Attorney’s Office, the conduct occurred between 2010 and 2020. During that period, CVS pharmacies:

Dispensed quantities of insulin exceeding prescription directions.

Refilled prescriptions prematurely, before patients had used prior supplies.

Reported inaccurate days-of-supply on reimbursement claims, preventing pharmacy benefit managers (PBMs) from detecting early refills.

Failed to follow PBM rules requiring overrides or resubmissions with accurate supply data.

CVS management was aware of audit findings showing violations related to premature refills and inaccurate reporting but did not implement adequate corrective actions during the covered period.

CVS admitted that its pharmacies sometimes did not break open insulin pen cartons, leading to dispensing amounts beyond plan limits, and that its auto-refill system occasionally generated premature refill notifications based on inaccurate supply data.

Statements from Federal Officials

US Attorney Jay Clayton described CVS’s conduct as a “decade-long practice of repeatedly prematurely refilling insulin prescriptions”, noting that the company’s failure to follow appropriate refill schedules increased costs for government programs and wasted taxpayer funds.

He emphasized that the settlement “reflects our continued commitment to holding pharmacies to account, enforcing rules designed to keep costs down, and protecting taxpayer dollars.”

Officials from the HHS Office of Inspector General (HHS-OIG), the Defense Criminal Investigative Service (DCIS), and the Office of Personnel Management OIG (OPM-OIG) underscored the importance of compliance with federal billing standards:

HHS-OIG’s Naomi D. Gruchacz stated that federal health programs depend on accurate billing and responsible reimbursement practices.

DCIS Acting Special Agent in Charge Christopher M. Silvestro reaffirmed that investigating false claims against TRICARE remains a top priority.

OPM-OIG Special Agent in Charge Derek M. Holt noted that false claims for unnecessary insulin refills “exploit benefits that federal employees rely on to manage their health.”

Background on Insulin Dispensing Practices

The case centered on insulin pens, which are packaged in five-pen cartons, each containing 300 units of insulin. Pharmacies are required to report the quantity dispensed and days-of-supply when seeking reimbursement.

Government health care programs and PBMs limit the days-of-supply that can be billed (often 30 days) and deny premature refill claims. These safeguards depend on accurate pharmacy reporting.

The government alleged that CVS manipulated or misreported supply data, which prevented PBMs from detecting violations. The result was over-dispensing, leading some patients to accumulate unused and potentially expired insulin.

Resolution and Oversight

As part of the settlement, CVS admitted to the conduct alleged in the government’s complaint and accepted responsibility. The company will pay $37.76 million in total.

The government’s case was handled by the Civil Frauds Unit of the US Attorney’s Office, led by Assistant US Attorney Pierre Armand, with investigative support from HHS-OIG, DCIS, OPM-OIG, the Department of Veterans Affairs OIG, and the US Postal Service OIG.

In addition to the government’s complaint, five private whistleblower lawsuits were joined under the False Claims Act.

The catastrophic cap for TRS next year is $1324.","Tricare Reserve Select operates like any standard health plan. The Soldier would look up network providers on either Tricare Humana East's or TriWest's website, depending on which state they are in.

First, for 2026, the Soldier will pay premiums of $57.88 for an individual plan or $286.66 for a family plan. The premium is the monthly amount paid for the insurance.

Second, the deductible varies by rank. For E-4 and below, the deductible is $66 for an individual or $132 for a family. For E-5 and above, the individual deductible is $198 and the family deductible is $397. A deductible is the amount that the Soldier pays before Tricare pays anything.

Third, once the deductible is met, cost-sharing kicks in. The amounts vary by the type of provider, but as an example, primary care visits are $19. Specialty care is $33. Urgent care is $26, etc. See the link below for costs.

Fourth, there is a catastrophic cap. This means that once the service member has paid a certain amount of money for care (deductible, copays, etc.), then everything is covered at 100%. The catastrophic cap for TRS next year is $1324.

If you want to explain to a Soldier how it all works, make sure and let them know that total out of pocket costs for the year would be 12 months of premiums, plus the catastrophic cap. For example, a junior enlisted would pay $694.56 in premiums ($57.88 x 12 months), plus the catastrophic cap of $1324, for a total annual out of pocket cost of $2018.56.

Its also important to note that prescription costs count towards the deductible and catastrophic cap. Some health plans have a separate deductible for prescriptions.

Dental is separate and is through Tricare United Concordia Dental Plan.

A Virginia-based clinical laboratory will pay at least $758,000 to resolve federal allegations that it funneled illegal kickbacks to physicians and marketers to generate test referrals. Prosecutors say NEXT Molecular Analytics disguised improper payments as consulting or medical director fees for doctors in Texas and Arkansas, while also compensating independent marketers based on the volume and value of test orders — actions that allegedly led to claims submitted to Medicare, Medicaid and TRICARE.

Newly synthesized fungal compound shows early promise against pediatric brain cancer

MIT chemists have, for the first time, created verticillin A in the lab — a notoriously complex fungal molecule that has intrigued cancer researchers for decades. With reliable access to the compound, the team was able to design sturdier versions that Dana-Farber scientists then tested in diffuse midline glioma (DMG), a devastating childhood brain cancer with limited treatment options. Some of these derivatives were strikingly effective at killing DMG cells, particularly those driven by high EZHIP expression.

While the work, published in the Journal of the American Chemical Society, is still at a very early stage, researchers say having a practical way to make and modify verticillin A opens the door to deeper studies.

Study projects climate-driven sleep loss by 2099

Nighttime heat may become a significant public health stressor, according to a large analysis from the Keck School of Medicine of USC, published in Environment International, that links rising temperatures to shorter and more fragmented sleep in U.S. adults. Using more than 12 million FitBit-recorded nights from over 14,000 participants, investigators found that a 10°C (50°F) rise in nighttime temperatures corresponded to 2.6 minutes of lost sleep, with disproportionate effects among women, Hispanic individuals, people with chronic illness and those of lower socioeconomic status.

U.S. college students are reaching adulthood at a time when the affordability of healthcare and health insurance is a growing concern.

According to a recent Gallup poll, 47% of U.S. adults are concerned about affording healthcare in 2026, the highest percentage since West Health and Gallup began polling for this measure in 2021.

“One in five Americans — also a record high — report that they or someone in their household couldn’t pay for prescription medications in the past three months,” the website reads. “These are merely two of countless healthcare hurdles Americans face.”

Even for college students, these statistics on paper can quickly become reality. Sugar Land sophomore Coralee Heyden said she discovered that her family had recently lost their insurance coverage while buying prescription medicine from CVS Pharmacy.

“It is too expensive for me,” Heyden said. “What am I going to do? Just not get it? Let my grades suffer? It’s not an option. I’m sitting there in my head going over, ‘OK, how many things will I have to save up for the next few months until I can find a job for myself?’”

But Heyden said she was not the only one struggling at the CVS Pharmacy counter that day. She was struck by the “cold reality” of the current healthcare system in the U.S.

“This one lady next to me, she’s trying to get her own medication that I think she needs probably just to survive … but she’s taking a long time in the line, and the lines piling up, and she’s apologizing to the people behind her while also trying to figure out why her payment’s not processing through there,” Heyden said.

Heyden said she had not given much thought to rising healthcare costs until she became responsible for her own, and she thinks other students should consider their healthcare costs as well.

“Ask your parents about their insurance plan, I would say, try and get that sorted out,” Heyden said. “You never know when you’re going to end up needing that information, and you’re going to feel stupid when you don’t have it, because you are an adult now.”

Baylor Health Services Insurance Claims Coordinator Lisa Bland said she has noticed insurance costs rising each academic year.

“We work with Academic HealthPlans to work with Blue Cross Blue Shield to see what we can do to lower those costs, and the rising cost of healthcare is kind of out of control,” Bland said. “We hate it.”

Bland said Baylor offers the Baylor University Student Health Insurance Plan, administered by Blue Cross Blue Shield of Texas, to be affordable to students.

“It’s widely taken all over the United States, so even our online students can use this if they live in other areas, or if students go on vacation or go back home and they’re not from here, they can still use it,” Bland said. “It’s got a low $500 deductible. Office visits are $35. Specialist visits are $45. Lab x-rays, procedures, whatnot, are covered at 80%. There’s prescription coverages dubbed by tiers.”

If an incoming student has an outside insurance provider, Bland said she would encourage them to call the member services number on the back of their insurance card to make sure they are networked with Baylor.

“While we’re networked with most major plans, even the major insurers, Cigna, Aetna, Blue Cross Blue Shield, will still have some one-off plans for certain employers that have a very small network, and we may not be a part of them,” Bland said. “So we do encourage that. We don’t like to surprise anybody with a bill that they didn’t expect.”

However, she said Health Services offers a self-pay discount plan to students who come with coverage that Baylor is not in network with or that does not provide out-of-state coverage, which takes 40% off the charges for services that are not vaccines and do not involve an outside lab.

“We started that spring break almost two years ago because we did notice we had a lot of students from California with Kaiser, and we are currently not in network with TRICARE,” Bland said. “We have a lot of TRICARE students, and some TRICARE plans will pay visits here, but most will not. We wanted to have them a lower-cost option.”

Even for those without student insurance or those who are self-paid, Bland said the Health Center tries to keep rates as low as possible.

“We just need to keep our lights on,” Bland said. “We’re not going to make a profit, but we just really try to just kind of cover everything we have to cover and still keep our rates low.”",https://baylorlariat.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/BPH05164.jpg,N,0.0,2025-12-05 07:56:56.596018

Monday, Dec. 8: As part of the Federal Benefits Open Season, service members can enroll in tax-savings accounts: a health care flexible spending account and a dependent care flexible spending account. These pre-tax accounts allow troops to set aside up to $3,400 in 2026 to pay for health care costs that Tricare doesn’t cover. Dependent care flexible spending accounts help defray the costs of child care and other dependent care. The Internal Revenue Service allows individuals to set aside up to $7,500 per year for dependent care costs if they are married and file a joint tax return or if they file as single or head of household. Visit fsafeds.gov for more information and to enroll.

Previous participation in these flexible spending programs doesn’t automatically carry over, meaning individuals must must enroll each year.

New Tricare Prime demo starts in 2026

Roughly 150,000 Tricare beneficiaries living in the Atlanta, Georgia, and Tampa, Florida, metropolitan areas will have a new Tricare Prime option next year through a demonstration project being conducted by the Defense Health Agency.

Those interested must enroll during open season. For more information and to enroll, visit enrolltricare.com, or call 877-996-9333 from 8 a.m. to 6 p.m. Eastern Standard Time, Monday through Friday. Those eligible can also enroll through the web enrollment portal at milconnect.dmdc.osd.mil by searching for Tricare Prime demo.

Information was not available about how many beneficiaries have signed up to date for the demonstration project.

CareSource Military and Veterans Co., of Dayton, Ohio, will run three-year demonstration projects for the two areas, under contracts worth a combined total of $110 million.

Those eligible are active-duty family members; family members of activated National Guard or Reserve members; retirees, their family members or survivors who aren’t eligible for Medicare; and those enrolled in the Transitional Compensation Program.

A key benefit for those enrolled in Tricare Prime through this project is that they won’t be required to get referrals for in-network specialty care, as is normally required in Tricare Prime.

“We’ve received positive feedback from beneficiaries enrolling in the Tricare Prime demo … especially regarding their ability to see in-network specialists without referrals,” CareSource officials said in a statement to Military Times. “Many beneficiaries also indicated that maintaining their providers and comprehensive coverage was an important factor in their decision.”

For the first year of the demonstration project, enrollment fees are waived for retirees, their family members and survivors. Active-duty service members, their family members and transitional survivors don’t pay Tricare Prime enrollment fees.

While those in Tricare Select currently don’t have to get referrals, they could choose to switch to the Tricare Prime demo option which doesn’t require referrals and also provides the additional benefit of case management and care coordination for those who need it.

CareSource will help Tricare families navigate finding a provider, getting an appointment and providing more hands-on personal support.

Washington, D.C. — Today, U.S. Senator Patty Murray (D-WA), a senior member and former chair of the Senate Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions (HELP) Committee, released the following statement in response to reporting in MS NOW that House Speaker Mike Johnson is working behind the scenes to strip a provision—based on legislation Senator Murray helped introduce earlier this year— that would mandate TRICARE health care coverage for fertility services, including in vitro fertilization (IVF), for all active-duty servicemembers.

“Right now, servicemembers who risk their lives for our country can’t get the same IVF coverage that’s available to other federal employees—that’s plain wrong, and it’s outrageous that once again, Speaker Johnson and his anti-abortion allies are standing in the way of a simple legislative fix. Members of the military face a higher rate of infertility often because of their service to our country, but Republicans want to deny these servicemembers the ability to grow their families.

“Speaker Johnson is among the most extreme anti-abortion radicals in Congress who believes embryos should have the same rights as living, breathing human beings—it’s disgraceful but not surprising that he is working behind the scenes to force servicemembers to suffer through infertility rather than grow their families through IVF.

“I’ll keep pushing to protect every servicemember’s right to IVF—and Donald Trump, who purports to support IVF, should join with Democrats to protect this provision.”

In April, Senator Murray joined Senator Tammy Duckworth (D-IL) in introducing the IVF for Military Families Act, new bicameral legislation that would require TRICARE—which provides health coverage to active duty military servicemembers, retirees, and their families—to cover fertility services, including IVF, for servicemembers and their families. The Senate-passed NDAA included a provision that mirrors the IVF for Military Families Act—Speaker Johnson is reportedly working to remove that provision from the final NDAA legislation.

As the daughter of a disabled World War II veteran, Senator Murray knows firsthand the sacrifice that military service demands and has been fighting for over a decade to expand access to IVF care and other fertility services for veterans and servicemembers, and to protect servicemembers’ and veterans’ access to the reproductive care they deserve. She has introduced multiple pieces of legislation to address the challenges veterans face when starting a family after their service, and in 2012, Senator Murray secured Senate passage of a provision to end the ban on IVF services at VA.

Senator Murray has helped lead the charge in the Senate to protect IVF from Republican attacks for the millions of Americans—including servicemembers and veterans—who rely on it to grow their families. Last Congress, Murray introduced the Right to IVF Act in the Senate—which would establish a nationwide right to IVF and other assisted reproductive technology (ART) and lower the costs of IVF treatment for middle-class families, and includes the Veteran Families Health Services Act. Despite many Republicans publicly claiming to support IVF, nearly every Senate Republican voted against the Right to IVF Act on two separate occasions last year. Overall, Republicans blocked legislation that would protect IVF nationwide three separate times last year.

“Womack’s number one priority is to deliver readiness through safe, quality, and integrated healthcare,” said Col. Stephanie Mont, WAMC Commander.
“Our leadership at every level is focused on ensuring that safety is at the forefront of every patient experience.
According to Colleen Wehner, patient safety manager, if staff are fearful of reporting an unsafe condition, the facility will be unable to identify and address those issues leading to patient harm.
“The goal is to build a psychological safety that encourages staff to report incidents and near misses.” The hospital uses data to inform patient safety decisions and track progress, utilizing evidence-based clinical measures, key performance indicators, and staff and patient feedback.","FORT BRAGG, NC -Womack Army Medical Center (WAMC) has received an “A” score from Leapfrog, a national nonprofit organization that evaluates healthcare providers on patient safety, one of 18 military hospitals to receive this top score.

“Womack’s number one priority is to deliver readiness through safe, quality, and integrated healthcare,” said Col. Stephanie Mont, WAMC Commander. “Our leadership at every level is focused on ensuring that safety is at the forefront of every patient experience. We encourage our patients and our staff to communicate concerns immediately so that we can work together to provide the highest quality of healthcare for the Fort Bragg community.”

The hospital’s approach to safety is formalized though the Military Health System’s Ready Reliable Care (RRC) framework, which provides a standardized evidenced based approach to improving processes, reducing harm and building a culture of trust.

Encouraging staff to report incidents or near misses without fear of reprisal is one of its key concepts.

According to Colleen Wehner, patient safety manager, if staff are fearful of reporting an unsafe condition, the facility will be unable to identify and address those issues leading to patient harm.

“We focus on what allowed this to happen instead of who made the error,” said Wehner. “The goal is to build a psychological safety that encourages staff to report incidents and near misses.”

The hospital uses data to inform patient safety decisions and track progress, utilizing evidence-based clinical measures, key performance indicators, and staff and patient feedback.

The Patient and Family Partnership Council is one outlet that gives patients and their families a voice in their healthcare by partnering with Womack to make direct improvements to hospital care and safety. Beneficiaries assigned to any of the Womack Clinics can be a part of this council that meets at 10 a.m. every second Wednesday in the Weaver auditorium.

“Many of the measures are available on the Leapfrog website,” said Wehner. “We stay up to date with evolving patient safety best practices and regulations by reviewing peer-reviewed literature and seeking guidance from medical and professional communities.”

WAMC continues to stay up to date with evolving patient safety best practices and regulations by reviewing peer-reviewed literature and seeking the latest guidance from medical and professional communities. They also monitor the standards and guidance of the accrediting agency Joint Commission, and the Defense Health Agency (DHA).

“This distinction belongs to teams of professionals at these military hospitals, who are dedicated to meeting the highest safety standards in the United States.” The Leapfrog Hospital Safety Grade program, updated twice a year, evaluates public and private hospitals.","DECEMBER 4, 2025 – The Defense Health Agency announced 18 military hospitals received an “A” rating in the Leapfrog Hospital Safety Grade assessment for fall 2025. These high grades reflect DHA’s commitment to transparency and continuous improvement in providing high-quality care to its patients.

“These ratings underscore the strength of our integrated Military Health System and the unwavering commitment of our teams to safe, high-quality care,” said Air Force Maj. Gen. Jeannine Ryder, DHA’s acting assistant director for Health Care Administration. “When our hospitals perform at this level, it reinforces trust — trust from our patients, our families, and the service members who rely on us to sustain readiness at home and abroad. This achievement reflects disciplined processes and a continuous focus on improvement across every military treatment facility.”

The Leapfrog Group is a national, independent organization focused on health care quality. The organization evaluates hospitals on a wide range of safety measures, including errors, injuries, and infections. Leapfrog’s grading system uses up to 22 evidence-based measures of patient safety.

A hospital must meet specific criteria to be eligible for participation in the Leapfrog safety assessment. In the Fall 2025 ratings, 32% of participating hospitals nationwide received the highest grade. Of the eligible military hospitals participating in the grading assessment, 90% received an “A” grade.

“I am incredibly proud that a record number of our military hospitals have received an A grade this fall,” said Dr. Paul Cordts, DHA’s deputy assistant director for Medical Affairs and chief medical officer. “Participation in Leapfrog’s Hospital Safety Grade program provides a welcome opportunity to evaluate and improve health care across DHA’s global system of military hospitals and clinics.”

DHA’s engagement with Leapfrog began about eight years ago when it sought to incorporate Leapfrog’s evaluations into the Military Health System’s Quality Assurance Program. Walter Reed National Military Medical Center was the first military test site for Leapfrog surveys. After seeing positive results, DHA expanded the program across other eligible military hospitals. 2025 marks the first time certain military hospitals overseas qualified to receive an official safety grade.

“We hope these latest Hospital Safety Grades inspire our patients’ confidence in the quality and safety of care they receive,” said Cordts. “This distinction belongs to teams of professionals at these military hospitals, who are dedicated to meeting the highest safety standards in the United States.”

The Leapfrog Hospital Safety Grade program, updated twice a year, evaluates public and private hospitals. Its grades are based on national standards for hospital safety and highlight risks that patients may face in a health care setting, including preventable medical errors and infections. The ratings are available to the public, making it easier for patients to understand the safety standards of their local health care facilities.

The 18 military hospitals that received an “A” grade for Fall 2025 are:

“DHA’s fall 2025 ’A’ Hospital Safety Grades demonstrate a nationally recognized achievement for prioritizing quality health care and patient safety,” said Cordts. “We are proud that the care provided at these hospitals ranks among the very best in the nation.”

Some military hospitals and clinics were not included in the safety grades this fall because they did not meet the minimum requirements for reporting criteria used by Leapfrog. The DHA has instituted similar criteria internally to track patient safety metrics for all facilities that did not qualify for official Leapfrog grades.",https://www.militaryspot.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/hospital-grades.png,N,0.0,2025-12-04 15:56:53.676869

If the provision is stripped from the final version of the NDAA, it would prevent the expansion of IVF access to all servicemembers.
“His views are completely out of touch with the vast majority of Americans who support access to IVF, including his own president.
We urge Speaker Johnson and congressional leadership to keep this provision and align the NDAA with the values of the American people and the administration.” Speaker's Past IVF Remarks Speaker Johnson has been asked about IVF before, including in March 2024 after Alabama Republican Gov.
“Attacking active servicemembers’ access to IVF and fertility treatments is a new and cowardly low, even for Speaker Johnson,” Amy Williams Navarro, director of government relations for Reproductive Freedom for All, said in a statement.","House Speaker Mike Johnson of Louisiana is allegedly working behind the scenes to get rid of a provision mandating health care coverage for assisted reproductive technology, including in vitro fertilization (IVF), for all active-duty service members from the National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA).

That is according to U.S. Sen. Tammy Duckworth (D-IL), who told Military.com that Johnson is targeting TRICARE—the insurance plan for service members and their families outside of military facilities that covers IVF for everyone regardless of health situations. MS Now first reported the story.

If the provision is stripped from the final version of the NDAA, it would prevent the expansion of IVF access to all servicemembers. Current insurance plans through TRICARE only cover fertility services for service members whose infertility was caused by “a serious or severe illness or injury while on active duty.”

Johnson 'Out of Touch'

Duckworth, a disabled U.S. Army veteran who struggled with infertility for a decade before she used IVF to conceive her daughters, wrote in a post on X that Johnson’s alleged intentions equate to “single-handedly trying to kill” the provision that both the House and Senate previously supported in negotiations.

“This is yet another excuse from Speaker Mike Johnson in a pathetic attempt to carry out his extreme, right-wing belief that considers hopeful parents who depend on IVF—and their doctors—as murderers,” Duckworth told Military.com. “His views are completely out of touch with the vast majority of Americans who support access to IVF, including his own president.

“He needs to stop getting between [President Donald] Trump and his promise to the American people, fall in line, and help ensure our heroes get the same access to IVF coverage as members of Congress already receive. Anything less is hypocrisy at its worst.”

“This is yet another excuse from Speaker Mike Johnson in a pathetic attempt to carry out his extreme, right-wing belief that considers hopeful parents who depend on IVF—and their doctors—as murderers.""

A spokesperson for Johnson told MS Now that he, the GOP are working to expand IVF and that “the Speaker has clearly and repeatedly stated he is supportive of access to IVF when sufficient pro-life protections are in place, and he will continue to be supportive when it is done responsibly and ethically.""

Military.com reached out to Johnson’s office for comment.

Danielle Melfi, CEO of RESOLVE: The National Infertility Association, told Military.com that ""removing the IVF coverage provision from the NDAA would deny coverage to the very families who have sacrificed so much for our country.

""Stripping this language, which had bipartisan support, would once again leave servicemembers without the same care that members of Congress and their staff have,"" Melfi said. ""Moreover, this action would run counter to President Trump’s public commitment to expand access to IVF.

“Americans overwhelmingly support access to IVF. Standing with our troops means ensuring they have the full range of medical care needed to build their families. We urge Speaker Johnson and congressional leadership to keep this provision and align the NDAA with the values of the American people and the administration.”

Speaker's Past IVF Remarks

Speaker Johnson has been asked about IVF before, including in March 2024 after Alabama Republican Gov. Kay Ivey signed legislation protecting IVF providers from legal liability. The issue caused consternation before and after the fact considering that Alabama’s Supreme Court said in a prior ruling that embryos could be considered children under state law.

Johnson told CBS Mornings at the time that Alabama “has done a good job” of grappling with the issue.

""We need to look at the ethics surrounding that issue, but it's an important one,"" Johnson said. ""If you do believe that life begins at conception, it's a really important question to wrestle with.""

The pro-life advocate mentioned his position in support of the ""sanctity of life"" as well as IVF, adding that states must consider the ""ethical handling"" of IVF.

""In some states, like in Louisiana, there's a limit on the number of embryos that can be created because they're sensitive to that issue,"" he added.

Trump's IVF Expansion

The claimed impending stripping down of the TRICARE provision would be antithetical to what President Trump campaigned on leading up to the 2024 election.

As recently as October, the president announced his intent to further lower costs and expand access to IVF when he said EMD Serono, one of the world’s leading manufacturers of fertility medications, had reached an agreement with the White House to provide “massive cost savings on fertility treatments” for all Americans.

The agreement includes EMD Serono, for the first time, investing in related manufacturing within the United States. The announcement made no direct mention to IVF and its fiscal ties to the U.S. military and/or its active-duty members.

A Biden-era Defense Department policy in March 2024 expanded TRICARE eligibility for infertility treatments to unmarried service members and those needing donated eggs or sperm, adding onto a previous policy when the DoD only offered such treatments to certain married service members.

Eggs or sperm donated by a third party were also prohibited by DoD at that juncture, effectively barring same-sex couples from the benefit.

“Trump touted himself as the Father of IVF both on the campaign trail and in office,” Duckworth told MS Now. “Time and time again, as recently as October, he’s promised that he would cover IVF for American families — but apparently not military families.”

Military.com reached out to the White House for comment.

Military Veterans Affected by Infertility

The National Health Study for a New Generation of U.S. Veterans, a 2014 study of 60,000 Operation Enduring Freedom (OEF), Operation Iraqi Freedom (OIF), and OEF/OIF-era veterans, is one of the largest scientific research studies of this group of veterans and included input from roughly 20,500 veterans. Data remains featured on the Department of Veterans Affairs website.

It found that of those veterans who served during those periods, 15.8% of women and 13.8% of men reported that they had experienced infertility—defined as attempts with a partner to get pregnant for more than 12 months.

While assessing rates of comparison between the general population and military service members is acknowledged within the study as a difficult task due to the intricacies associated with infertility, they did note that female veterans were more likely to seek care for infertility than male veterans.

Also, approximately 40% of men and women Veterans with a history of infertility reported that they or their partner sought infertility treatment.

“Attacking active servicemembers’ access to IVF and fertility treatments is a new and cowardly low, even for Speaker Johnson,” Amy Williams Navarro, director of government relations for Reproductive Freedom for All, said in a statement. “It’s a cruel irony that Johnson, who has always publicly claimed to support and protect servicemembers, is now working behind the scenes to take IVF coverage away from the people who bravely serve our country.”

“We stay up to date with evolving patient safety best practices and regulations by reviewing peer-reviewed literature and seeking guidance from medical and professional communities.”","FORT BRAGG, NC -Womack Army Medical Center (WAMC) has received an “A” score from Leapfrog, a national nonprofit organization that evaluates healthcare providers on patient safety, one of 18 military hospitals to receive this top score.

“Womack’s number one priority is to deliver readiness through safe, quality, and integrated healthcare,” said Col. Stephanie Mont, WAMC Commander. “Our leadership at every level is focused on ensuring that safety is at the forefront of every patient experience. We encourage our patients and our staff to communicate concerns immediately so that we can work together to provide the highest quality of healthcare for the Fort Bragg community.”

The hospital’s approach to safety is formalized though the Military Health System’s Ready Reliable Care (RRC) framework, which provides a standardized evidenced based approach to improving processes, reducing harm and building a culture of trust.

Encouraging staff to report incidents or near misses without fear of reprisal is one of its key concepts. According to Colleen Wehner, patient safety manager, if staff are fearful of reporting an unsafe condition, the facility will be unable to identify and address those issues leading to patient harm.

“We focus on what allowed this to happen instead of who made the error,” said Wehner. “The goal is to build a psychological safety that encourages staff to report incidents and near misses.”

The hospital uses data to inform patient safety decisions and track progress, utilizing evidence-based clinical measures, key performance indicators, and staff and patient feedback.

The Patient and Family Partnership Council is one outlet that gives patients and their families a voice in their healthcare by partnering with Womack to make direct improvements to hospital care and safety. Beneficiaries assigned to any of the Womack Clinics can be a part of this council that meets at 10 a.m. every second Wednesday in the Weaver auditorium.

As part of the settlement, CVS also admitted and accepted responsibility for certain conduct alleged by the Government in its complaint, including that GHPs paid CVS substantial amounts for insulin pen refills that were ineligible for reimbursement and CVS pharmacies dispensed more insulin to GHP beneficiaries than they needed.
“CVS engaged in a decade-long practice of repeatedly prematurely refilling insulin prescriptions for patients and improperly billing government healthcare programs for more insulin than patients needed,” said U.S. Attorney Jay Clayton.
“These programs rely on pharmacies to follow appropriate refill schedules and to accurately report the amount of medicine dispensed, which CVS pharmacies frequently failed to do.
This settlement reflects our continued commitment to holding pharmacies to account, enforcing rules designed to keep costs down, and protecting taxpayer dollars.”","United States Attorney for the Southern District of New York, Jay Clayton, Special Agent in Charge of the New York Regional Office of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services Office of the Inspector General, Naomi D. Gruchacz, Acting Special Agent in Charge of the Northeast Field Office of the Defense Criminal Investigative Service, Christopher M. Silvestro, and Special Agent in Charge of the U.S. Office of Personnel Management Office of the Inspector General, Derek M. Holt, announced that the United States has filed and settled a healthcare fraud lawsuit against CVS Pharmacy.

The settlement resolves allegations that, from 2010 through 2020, CVS violated the False Claims Act in connection with its billing and dispensing of insulin pens to patients enrolled in Government healthcare programs, including Medicare, Medicaid, TRICARE and the Federal Employees Health Benefits Program. Specifically, the Government alleges that CVS improperly requested and received GHP reimbursement for premature refills, dispensed more insulin pens than patients needed according to their prescriptions and falsely under-reported the days-of-supply of insulin that its pharmacies dispensed, per an announcement from the United States Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York.

A CVS Health spokesperson provided DSN with the following statement, ""While we do everything we can to ensure patients can access the medications they need, insulin pen billing has long been a challenge for pharmacies. Factors like FDA labeling changes, no single pen packaging options, insulin dosing variability, and varying payor supply limits and instructions have made billing for these medications incredibly complex. In recent years, the evolution of PBM and payor practices to account for insulin pen packaging and other technological enhancements have helped alleviate some of these challenges. With this settlement, we’re pleased to put this issue behind us and avoid the cost and expense of litigation.""

Under the settlement approved by U.S. District Judge John G.

As part of the settlement, CVS also admitted and accepted responsibility for certain conduct alleged by the Government in its complaint, including that GHPs paid CVS substantial amounts for insulin pen refills that were ineligible for reimbursement and CVS pharmacies dispensed more insulin to GHP beneficiaries than they needed.

“CVS engaged in a decade-long practice of repeatedly prematurely refilling insulin prescriptions for patients and improperly billing government healthcare programs for more insulin than patients needed,” said U.S. Attorney Jay Clayton. “These programs rely on pharmacies to follow appropriate refill schedules and to accurately report the amount of medicine dispensed, which CVS pharmacies frequently failed to do.

With antibiotic resistance rising in recent years, the Pentagon has quietly provided funding to a microcap biotech firm whose civilian wound program may also solve one of modern warfare’s most dangerous medical problems

For decades, antibiotics functioned as a silent guardian of modern warfare. After penicillin’s mass production in World War II, battlefield infections - historically a leading cause of death from wounds - fell dramatically with the mass deployment of penicillin and modern surgical care. Today’s soldiers survive injuries that would have been fatal for every generation before them. But that advantage is eroding.

In conflict zones from Eastern Europe to the Middle East, military clinicians are reporting a troubling resurgence of drug-resistant bacteria. Wounds that should heal are instead becoming entrenched infections, often impervious to even the strongest antibiotics. It is a quiet crisis, but one U.S. defense health officials increasingly frame as a threat to force readiness.

What’s interesting is where the U.S. military seems to believe part of the solution may come from: a publicly traded microcap focused on diabetic foot infections. That company is BiomX (NYSE: PHGE) - and despite a market cap hovering at just around to ~$7 million, it has already received approximately $40 million in non-dilutive funding from the U.S. Defense Health Agency and the Department of the Navy under an award managed by the Naval Medical Research Command.

The reason doesn’t seem to be found in its stock chart, but rather in the biology.

Why the Pentagon Cares About a Diabetic Infection Company

Whether the wound begins with shrapnel or with a diabetic foot ulcer, the same biological enemy often stands in the way of healing: bacteria such as Staphylococcus aureus protected inside biofilms.

Biofilms act like fortified shelters. Once bacteria establish these structures deep inside tissue, antibiotics struggle to penetrate. The immune system can’t reach them. Infection lingers. Tissue dies. Amputation risk rises.

This is why both a soldier’s blast injury and a civilian diabetic ulcer can lead to the same devastating outcome: a limb that cannot be saved.

BiomX develops bacteriophage therapies - precision viruses engineered to target and destroy harmful bacteria, including those hiding in biofilms. Phages replicate at the site of infection and, in preclinical and clinical studies, have shown activity against bacteria within biofilms.

That capability is what brought the military to BiomX’s door.

The Pentagon cannot run clinical trials on an active battlefield. But it can study the same biology in civilian patients - and diabetic foot infections happen to be one of the most predictable, high-volume environments to evaluate phage effectiveness against Staph aureus.

BiomX’s program, therefore, seems to serve two strategic purposes: a legitimate civilian medical need and a proxy model for battlefield trauma care.

Where Civilian Data Meets Military Relevance

BiomX already has initial human data showing that its phage technology can meaningfully impact hard-to-treat infections. In its Phase 2 trial in diabetic foot osteomyelitis - one of the most stubborn chronic infections - the company demonstrated statistically significant improvements in ulcer size (percent area reduction), ulcer depth (in a predefined subgroup), and in limiting ulcer area expansion compared to placebo.

For the Defense Health Agency, these results are likely relevant because they involve deep, biofilm-associated infections where antibiotic resistance is a growing concern — similar to the wound infections seen in combat casualties.

Building on that data, BiomX is now advancing BX011, a topical phage cocktail for diabetic foot infections that occur earlier and more commonly than bone infections. The FDA recently provided feedback confirming that BiomX does not need additional non-clinical studies before proceeding - an important step that gives the program a clearer clinical path.

And here is where the civilian-military link becomes clear: If BX011 proves effective in early-stage diabetic infections, it establishes the same biological principle that military clinicians are urgently looking for in battlefield trauma care. At that point, the Pentagon doesn’t need to reinvent anything - it could potentially adopt an FDA-approved product that has already been validated in civilian care.

It’s a rare example of civilian medicine directly accelerating national defense preparedness.

A Microcap With Outsized Strategic Weight

What makes BiomX notable is not hype - it’s what seems to be a stark potential mismatch between its low market cap and the level of attention it has attracted from U.S. defense and regulatory agencies. The company trades at a market cap of under $10 million as of now, yet it is engaged with the Defense Health Agency and the FDA at a depth typically associated with mid-stage companies worth many times more. The Defense Health Agency routinely funds high-risk research, but securing roughly $40 million in non-dilutive support seems unusual for a company of BiomX’s size and functions as a meaningful vote of confidence in the underlying science.

At the same time, the civilian market BiomX is targeting is enormous. Diabetic foot infections contribute to an estimated 160,000 lower-limb amputations among U.S. diabetic patients every year, creating a multi-billion-dollar annual economic burden. Some analyses estimate that the direct costs of diabetic foot complications alone exceed $8 billion annually. The clinical toll is equally severe: five-year mortality rates following diabetic foot–related amputation are comparable to, and in some cases worse than, several common cancers.

Despite this scale, innovation has been limited. Standard care still relies heavily on long courses of broad-spectrum antibiotics and surgical intervention, even as resistance rises and outcomes stagnate. And while early-stage companies naturally face risks - from cash runway to clinical execution to regulatory outcomes - a technology that can reliably improve outcomes in these infections, especially those driven by drug-resistant bacteria, would not only meet a pressing medical need but could reshape a multi-billion-dollar segment of infectious-disease care.

For 10 years starting in 2010, CVS pharmacists ordered refills of insulin pen prescriptions before patients finished previous supplies, the Justice Department said in a statement this week.

The pens are used to give insulin shots to people with type 1 and type 2 diabetes. Across all insulin types, the price of a 30-day supply of insulin increased from $271 in 2012 to $499 in 2021, a 184% increase, according to the Health Care Cost Institute.

But information from prescription drug discount service GoodRx states that insulin prices have since dropped significantly.

Federal prosecutors in the CVS case alleged that by dispensing refills too soon, the pharmacy was able to overbill Tricare, Medicare, Medicaid and the Federal Employees Health Benefits Program, according to court documents.

U.S. military personnel and their family members, including children who are either under 21 or full-time students under 23, are covered by Tricare.

Customers at times also received refills from CVS before their insurance plan would have approved reimbursement, prosecutors said.

Woonsocket, R.I.-based CVS said in a statement that insulin pen billing “has long been a challenge for pharmacies” because of labeling changes, variable dosing and packaging, and varying payor supply limits, Reuters reported Tuesday.

As part of the settlement, CVS will pay $24.4 million to the federal government, with the remainder distributed to 30 U.S. states, the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands.",https://www.stripes.com/incoming/ln1l7g-051225cvsphoto01.jpg/alternates/LANDSCAPE_480/051225CVSphoto01.jpg,N,0.0,2025-12-04 12:58:02.015659

You make sure nothing breaks, confirm your coverage still exists, and move on. This year is different for military families and veterans in the Atlanta and Tampa regions. For the first time in a long time, there’s a real choice inside TRICARE Prime, and it comes with some very practical, day-to-day advantages.

On the Tango Tango podcast, host Lloyd Knight sat down with Holly Joers of CareSource Military & Veterans to unpack what this new option actually means. The conversation covered everything from football and Thanksgiving travel to the fine print of health policy, but the core message was simple: if you live in Atlanta or Tampa and are eligible for TRICARE Prime, you now have another lane to pick, and switching into it could change how you interact with the healthcare system next year.

TRICARE open season runs from Nov. 10 through Dec. 9. Coverage under any changes you make starts January 1. If you do nothing, you stay with your current TRICARE option. If you want to move into the CareSource Military & Veterans TRICARE Prime plan, you have to actively choose it during that window. That’s the foundation everything else sits on.

TRICARE itself is familiar territory for most military families. It’s the health benefit tied to service, covering active-duty family members, retirees, retiree families, and survivors. Lloyd mentions he has been retired for nearly 19 years and has spent almost all of that time in TRICARE Prime. His experience will sound familiar to many: the benefit works, most of the time, but it has not exactly been known for competition or ease of use. The traditional referral process, in particular, has been a sore spot.

The CareSource offering exists because Congress decided to push on that status quo. In the 2017 National Defense Authorization Act, lawmakers directed the Department of Defense to test whether adding competition and choice inside TRICARE Prime could improve access and outcomes. The result is a three-year “competitive plans demonstration” in two markets, Atlanta and Tampa, where CareSource Military & Veterans now offers a TRICARE Prime plan alongside the legacy option. It’s still TRICARE, still Prime, still under the larger Defense Health Agency umbrella. The difference lies in who manages the plan and how it’s designed.

CareSource itself is not new. It is a nonprofit health plan that started in Ohio and has spent decades working with Medicaid and other vulnerable populations. Long before “social determinants of health” became a buzzword, CareSource was helping members navigate things like transportation, housing, and access to food because those needs affect medical outcomes. For the demonstration, they built a dedicated arm—CareSource Military & Veterans, or CSMV—to focus on the military-connected community.

One detail from the podcast that stands out is that the entire CSMV team is in some way affiliated with the military. Some are veterans, some are spouses, some grew up in military families. Holly herself spent her career in the Department of Defense, starting as a logistics specialist at Eglin Air Force Base, moving into test program management, working on the F-35 program, and eventually landing in health IT and modernization at the Defense Health Agency. She also happens to be a retired military spouse. Her path means she’s seen the system from the inside as a civil servant and felt it from the outside as a family member.

That perspective shows up in the features they chose to emphasize. The one that immediately grabbed Lloyd’s attention is straightforward: no referrals are required for in-network specialty care under the CareSource Military & Veterans TRICARE Prime plan. Under traditional TRICARE Prime, seeing a specialist often requires a mini-campaign. You book an appointment with your primary care manager, wait for that visit, secure a referral, and then wait again to see the specialist. For people juggling chronic conditions, multiple kids, or demanding work schedules, that loop eats time and patience.

With the demonstration plan, if the specialist is in-network, you can go directly to that provider without going back through the government referral process. Lloyd actually admits he’s been sitting on a stack of needed appointments and is waiting until January 1 so he can make them under the new plan without running the referral gauntlet. It’s a small change on paper that can feel like a big change in real life.

The program is not just about convenience, though. Holly spends a good portion of the conversation talking about coordinated, team-based care for those with complex medical needs. CareSource uses care managers and integrated care teams to help keep all of a member’s providers on the same page. Anyone who has ever recited their full medical history to every new doctor knows how draining and inefficient that can be. The idea here is that the system, not the patient, should be doing most of the connecting and repeating.

Getting help with a VA claim is free through accredited organizations like the VFW.

There’s also a detail that matters more to providers than patients, but which indirectly shapes access: CareSource pays claims quickly. Holly notes that the plan runs payments on a rolling Tuesday and Thursday schedule. For big hospital systems, cash flow delays are annoying. For small practices, independent specialists, and behavioral health providers, they can be existential. When a plan takes months to pay, some providers simply avoid it. A plan that pays reliably and quickly can be more attractive to those clinicians, which can translate into stronger networks for members.

The financial side for beneficiaries is part of the demonstration as well. For TRICARE Prime families who enroll with CareSource Military & Veterans, the enrollment fee is waived for the first year. In a world where costs seem to creep up everywhere, starting a new plan year without that fee is not a trivial benefit.

Atlanta and Tampa make interesting test beds in their own right. Atlanta is heavy on retirees and veterans spread across a wide metro area, with the usual traffic and distance problems that come with that. Tampa has a stronger active-duty footprint and a different mix of needs, but its own congestion and access challenges. In both cities, CareSource is leaning on local partnerships with veteran organizations and community groups to help families understand their options and find resources beyond just the health plan itself. Holly mentions conversations with key spouses and rural families in Georgia in particular, where distance and fewer local providers make choice and coordination even more critical.

For those who remember a previous TRICARE-related effort with Kaiser Permanente, Holly draws a helpful comparison. Kaiser’s model was largely a closed health system, where you receive care inside Kaiser facilities. CareSource, by contrast, is a health plan that builds a network across multiple health systems and independent providers. That open-network structure gives the demonstration a different flavor and potentially more flexibility in how beneficiaries access care.

None of this matters, of course, if people treat this open season like every other one and click past it. The most important practical point in the entire conversation is that default inertia still applies. If you are in the Atlanta or Tampa markets and do nothing by Dec. 9, you stay right where you are. If you like the sound of no in-network referrals, coordinated care teams, fast provider payments, a first-year fee waiver, and a plan purpose-built for military families by people who have actually lived that life, you have to raise your hand.

Enrolling follows the usual pattern: you can go through the online portal with your DS Logon credentials or call the toll-free number if the tech gives you trouble. Lloyd notes that when one of the Department of Defense systems had issues, CareSource steered people to the phones, and the process still went smoothly. He and his wife received their new cards in the mail shortly after.

The larger question hovering in the background is what happens after the three-year demonstration ends, and whether this idea of competition inside TRICARE Prime spreads beyond Atlanta and Tampa. Holly is careful not to overpromise. Congress and the Defense Health Agency are watching closely to see what works and what does not. If you live somewhere else and want similar options, the same rule that applies to almost everything in federal policy applies here: if you care about it, tell your representatives.

For now, the most immediate decision belongs to those within driving distance of Atlanta or Tampa. TRICARE open season is short, the holidays are noisy, and it is easy to let another year roll past without changing anything. This time, though, change is actually on the table. The Tango Tango episode is a reminder that the fine print of policy can show up in very practical ways in your daily life: how many appointments you juggle, how often you explain your story, how long you wait, and how much you pay. In this corner of the TRICARE world, at least for the next three years, you actually get to choose.

2025 marks the first time certain military hospitals overseas qualified to receive an official safety grade.
“We hope these latest Hospital Safety Grades inspire our patients’ confidence in the quality and safety of care they receive,” said Cordts.
“This distinction belongs to teams of professionals at these military hospitals, who are dedicated to meeting the highest safety standards in the United States.” The Leapfrog Hospital Safety Grade program, updated twice a year, evaluates public and private hospitals.
Naval Hospital Okinawa, Okinawa, Japan “DHA’s fall 2025 ’A’ Hospital Safety Grades demonstrate a nationally recognized achievement for prioritizing quality health care and patient safety,” said Cordts.","The Defense Health Agency announced 18 military hospitals received an ""A"" rating in the Leapfrog Hospital Safety Grade assessment for fall 2025. These high grades reflect DHA’s commitment to transparency and continuous improvement in providing high-quality care to its patients.

“These ratings underscore the strength of our integrated Military Health System and the unwavering commitment of our teams to safe, high-quality care,” said Air Force Maj. Gen. Jeannine Ryder, DHA’s acting assistant director for Health Care Administration. “When our hospitals perform at this level, it reinforces trust — trust from our patients, our families, and the service members who rely on us to sustain readiness at home and abroad. This achievement reflects disciplined processes and a continuous focus on improvement across every military treatment facility.”

The Leapfrog Group is a national, independent organization focused on health care quality. The organization evaluates hospitals on a wide range of safety measures, including errors, injuries, and infections. Leapfrog's grading system uses up to 22 evidence-based measures of patient safety.

A hospital must meet specific criteria to be eligible for participation in the Leapfrog safety assessment. In the Fall 2025 ratings, 32% of participating hospitals nationwide received the highest grade. Of the eligible military hospitals participating in the grading assessment, 90% received an ""A"" grade.

“I am incredibly proud that a record number of our military hospitals have received an A grade this fall,” said Dr. Paul Cordts, DHA’s deputy assistant director for Medical Affairs and chief medical officer. “Participation in Leapfrog’s Hospital Safety Grade program provides a welcome opportunity to evaluate and improve health care across DHA’s global system of military hospitals and clinics.”

DHA’s engagement with Leapfrog began about eight years ago when it sought to incorporate Leapfrog's evaluations into the Military Health System's Quality Assurance Program. Walter Reed National Military Medical Center was the first military test site for Leapfrog surveys. After seeing positive results, DHA expanded the program across other eligible military hospitals. 2025 marks the first time certain military hospitals overseas qualified to receive an official safety grade.

“We hope these latest Hospital Safety Grades inspire our patients’ confidence in the quality and safety of care they receive,” said Cordts. “This distinction belongs to teams of professionals at these military hospitals, who are dedicated to meeting the highest safety standards in the United States.”

The Leapfrog Hospital Safety Grade program, updated twice a year, evaluates public and private hospitals. Its grades are based on national standards for hospital safety and highlight risks that patients may face in a health care setting, including preventable medical errors and infections. The ratings are available to the public, making it easier for patients to understand the safety standards of their local health care facilities.

The 18 military hospitals that received an “A” grade for Fall 2025 are:

Alexander T. Augusta Military Medical Center, Fort Belvoir, Virginia

Blanchfield Army Community Hospital, Fort Campbell, Kentucky

Brooke Army Medical Center, Fort Sam Houston, Texas

“DHA’s fall 2025 ’A’ Hospital Safety Grades demonstrate a nationally recognized achievement for prioritizing quality health care and patient safety,” said Cordts. “We are proud that the care provided at these hospitals ranks among the very best in the nation.”

My question, then, is about what, if anything, VA healthcare can do for me.
Do I have to tell the MTF I am also eligible for VA healthcare?","Hello! I'd first like to say a heartfelt thanks to everyone who posts and comments in this sub. I've been reading for over a year and I have gotten so much terrific information and a lot of emotional support here throughout my claim process.

I have pieced a lot of bits together about my question, but even with all of the resources I've

consulted and searches I've done of this sub, I haven't been able to discern

what is the best answer for my unique situation, so thank you for indulging my

ask.

The tl;dr: is there any scenario in which someone who is dual VA/Tricare eligible would/should use VA healthcare?

I am a veteran but separated/not retired--as the spouse of a retiree, my healthcare is covered by Tricare. I get most of my care at the MTF, but I also pay out of pocket for two

providers that do not participate in any insurance plans (both are

specialists--one for my primary service connected rated conditions and the

other for care I was not satisfied with at the MTF).

I was recently rated 100% P/T. I'm not sure it matters since my combined schedular rating comes out to 100% either way, but I do have a single service-connected condition rated at

60% plus a secondary condition (direct result of that primary condition) rated

at 100%, plus an assortment of related and unrelated ratings between 10% and 50%. (I'm a mess, that's been established.)

I really like my specialists and don't mind continuing to pay those two physicians out of

pocket, indefinitely. The medications, imaging, and lab work they prescribe and

order are all covered by Tricare (thank goodness, because I would be a *very

expensive* add to my employer's group plan and would probably have way fewer

treatment options ... my primary and secondary conditions require around

$16,000/month in pharmacologic treatments that Tricare covers and I only pay a

$38 copay to have each 8-week supply mailed to my home).

My initial research indicates I’d be better off sticking with the Tricare formulary vs. the VA’s because Tricare’s “fail first” or step-therapy rules are less stringent. I have better and faster access to more treatment options with Tricare, especially as new biologics are coming out all the time and the way these drugs work, patients with my conditions tend to burn through biologics—they work for awhile, then the body starts recognizing them and rejecting them. It’s very important for me to have as many options as possible, even if I incur some expense for those options.

My question, then, is about what, if anything, VA healthcare can do for me. I plan to enroll regardless of whether I might ever use it, unless enrolling could jeopardize my participation in Tricare? For those of us with Tricare eligibility and acceptable care for our service-connected conditions, are there scenarios where we’d prefer or get additional benefit from using VA healthcare? Do I have to tell the MTF I am also eligible for VA healthcare? I know the “government plan pays last,” but what happens when it’s two government plans?

There is a small VA clinic about half an hour from where I live and a more comprehensive VA hospital/clinic facility about an hour away, so both are reasonably accessible.

Thanks again for any insight, links/resources, or shared experiences you can offer. I really appreciate you all.",,N,0.0,2025-12-04 06:56:49.129569

Many children with sensory processing differences like autism and ADHD benefit from occupational therapy.
Both can help with sensory processing challenges.","Occupational therapy is an activity-based therapy that focuses on developing and maintaining skills related to living an independent life. Occupational therapists empower children to engage in “occupations” or day-to-day activities.

To learn more about Occupational Therapy, check out our guide.

Occupational therapy helps autistic children develop life skills that allow them to engage and participate in meaningful activities such as play and academics. Because autistic children can often experience delays in some motor skills, have difficulty regulating emotions, and experience sensory processing differences, a qualified occupational therapist is well-equipped to support these unique needs.

Research shows that occupational therapy can improve self-help skills, motor skill development, sensory processing, nonverbal cognitive abilities, and socialization.

Many children with sensory processing differences like autism and ADHD benefit from occupational therapy. If your child experiences any of the following, ask an occupational therapist for an occupational therapy evaluation:

Delayed fine motor skills, including difficulty grasping objects, challenges with handwriting, and challenges with zipping or buttoning clothing

Impulsivity, including challenges in understanding and regulating emotional states

Challenges in visual processing and visual motor skills, such as visually tracking objects, copying/ tracing shapes and letters when writing, or locating items in a visual field, like finding a spoon in a drawer of different utensils

Sensory processing differences, such as over or under-sensitivity to various sounds, textures, smells, tastes, body position, and internal states like hunger/thirst

Delayed ability to perform self-help skills, such as feeding and dressing, by the typical age milestones

Developmental delays evident by decreased ability to reach developmental milestones by expected dates

Dysregulated body and/or emotions, including seeking or avoiding sensory input in some situations (e.g., this can look like frequent jumping or heightened anxiety in certain everyday situations)

Decreased ability to focus on tasks and directives, including academics and daily living activities

Physical therapy (PT) and occupational therapy (OT) can both help neurodivergent children lead more independent lives. Many people get the two therapies confused because they are so similar. PT focuses on improving physical movement and balance. OT focuses on improving daily functional abilities such as brushing teeth or toileting. Both can help with sensory processing challenges. Both PT and OT are typically covered by insurance.",https://beaminghealth.com/ogimage.png,N,0.0,2025-12-04 02:57:30.579942

HealthPartners Dental was available in Minnesota, Wisconsin, parts of Iowa, South Dakota and North Dakota.

FEDVIP is a voluntary, enrollee-pay-all insurance program. It is sponsored by the U.S. Office of Personnel Management (OPM) and offers eligible participants plan options and a choice between 11 dental insurance carriers for 2026.

For 2026, FEDVIP offers the following dental carriers:

Aetna Dental

Blue Cross Blue Shield FEP Dental

Delta Dental

Dominion National (regional)

EmblemHealth Dental (regional)

GEHA Connection Dental Federal

Humana (regional)

MetLife Federal Dental Plan

Triple-S Salud (regional)

United Concordia Dental

UnitedHealthcare Dental

An HMO plan includes predictable, predetermined fees, while a PPO plan covers procedures as a coinsurance percentage, and it might not be clear what your out-of-pocket costs will be.

FEDVIP offers “standard"" and ""high"" option plans. If you know you need major dental work done, you may want to explore a high option plan that may cover more of the cost for major restorative procedures. If you need only preventive dental care, a standard option plan may make more sense.

Outside of open season, FEDVIP enrollees may make plan changes only if they experience a qualifying life event (QLE), such as changing reserve status or marital status, an injury while on active duty, moving, having or adopting a child and other similar changes.

Beneficiaries whose plans are currently with HealthPartners Dental need to make a new election before the end of open enrollment on Dec. 8.

The BENEFEDS website provides tools allowing users to compare both plans and costs of dental services.

The FEDVIP open enrollment period for 2026 coverage ends at 11:59 p.m. Eastern time on Monday, Dec. 8, 2025.

“Winter weather impacts everyone differently.
In the event winter weather is not expected to impact operations and Munson is open, patients should conduct their own risk assessments based on their location before driving to the health center for care.
“Munson Army Health Center appreciates your patience and understanding during inclement weather events.","FORT LEAVENWORTH, Kansas -- As winter weather arrives in the region, Munson Army Health Center leaders remain committed to protecting the health and safety of patients and staff.

“Snow, ice, and severe cold can create hazardous travel conditions and impact clinic operations. Our goal is to maintain essential patient services whenever it is safe to do so. If weather conditions require delayed opening, modified staffing, or clinic closure, announcements for staff and patients will be made as early as possible,” said Lt. Col Scott Reynoldson, Munson Army Health Center, deputy commander for administration.

He explained that when inclement weather is forecast, Munson's operations division closely monitors local weather advisories, installation operations guidance, and conditions on and off post to determine any impacts to healthcare delivery.

In the event leaders determine a closure is necessary, staff will be notified by their supervisor or Munson’s DoD alert notification system.

Patients with scheduled appointments will typically be contacted by staff to reschedule or convert to a virtual appointment when medically appropriate, but general announcements will also be shared over official command sources including:

• Munson Army Health Center website — https://munson.tricare.mil

• Secure Message through the MHS GENESIS Patient Portal • Munson Army Health Center Facebook page • Official Fort Leavenworth, Combined Arms Command, and unit channels

During inclement weather, Reynoldson recommends patients check an official source before traveling to the health center for appointments, and walk-in services like pharmacy, medical records and immunizations, in the event of closures.

“Winter weather impacts everyone differently. Staying informed and making safe decisions helps keeps our entire community resilient throughout the season,” he said.

In the event winter weather is not expected to impact operations and Munson is open, patients should conduct their own risk assessments based on their location before driving to the health center for care.

“Conditions on post may be clear, but patients who live in outlying communities and must drive some distance from off post may have more hazards to consider. Do not risk driving in unsafe conditions. Your appointment can always be rescheduled,” he said.

Patients may contact Munson’s Call Center weekdays from 7:15 a.m. - 3:45 p.m. at 913 684-6250 or use the MHS GENESIS Patient Portal 24/7 at https://patientportal.mhsgenesis.health.mil. to cancel or reschedule an appointment.

Which health plan is right for me?

Your TRICARE health plan options depend on who you are and where you live. If you have multiple options, think about how you prefer to get care and how this affects your out-of-pocket costs. Also keep in mind that family members don’t all need to be enrolled in the same TRICARE plan.

Here’s how to learn more about your options and decide which plan is right for you.

Check the TRICARE Plan Finder to see which plans you may be eligible for.

Use the Compare Plans Tool to compare plans side by side.

Go to Health Plan Costs to compare 2026 out-of-pocket costs for TRICARE Prime and TRICARE Select.

Use the Find a Doctor Tool to find military hospitals and clinics and TRICARE network providers near you.

How do I make changes?

There are three ways to enroll in a TRICARE health plan or change your plan:

Online: Go to milConnect.

By phone: Call your TRICARE regional contractor or designated provider.

By enrollment form: Mail or fax an enrollment form to your TRICARE regional contractor or designated provider.

What if I don’t make changes during open season?

Are you happy with your current TRICARE coverage? You don’t need to do anything during TRICARE Open Season. If you’re already enrolled in a plan and you don’t make changes, you’ll continue in your current health plan as long as you’re eligible.

If you aren’t already in a plan and you don’t enroll in one during open season, you’ll only be eligible for care at a military hospital or clinic, if space is available.

Outside of TRICARE Open Season, you only can enroll in or change enrollment to a TRICARE Prime option or TRICARE Select if you have a QLE. Certain life changes open a 90-day window when you can change your TRICARE health plan. Common QLEs include moving, getting married, and having a baby.

During your 90-day QLE window, you can enroll in a new plan or switch between TRICARE plans, as described in the TRICARE Qualifying Life Events Fact Sheet.

What should I know about Federal Benefits Open Season?

Check out “Review your FEDVIP dental and vision coverage during Federal Benefits Open Season” to learn if you’re eligible to make changes during this time.

If you miss Federal Benefits Open Season, you may be able to enroll in dental and vision coverage after a FEDVIP QLE. Keep in mind that FEDVIP QLEs are different from TRICARE QLEs.

Murtha Cancer Center at Walter Reed recently hosted its annual Breast Cancer Awareness Summit at the Uniformed Services University. The event focused on new discoveries and compassionate care shaping the future of breast cancer research and treatment across the Military Health System.

Speakers addressed fertility preservation in oncology, intimacy after diagnosis, and innovations in breast surgery and radiation therapy. They also explored how scientific progress is reducing the need for invasive procedures while improving survivorship and quality of life.

A breast cancer diagnosis does not automatically end a service member’s career, noted Dr. Craig Shriver, MCC director and director of the MCC Research Programs. However, it can impact readiness by requiring the service member to spend extended time away from duty for treatment.

U.S. Air Force Lt. Col. (Dr.) Robert Krell, a surgical oncologist at Walter Reed, explained that axillary surgery for breast cancer may not be necessary in many cases thanks to advances in treatment and a clearer understanding of tumor biology. Providers can minimize harm through sentinel lymph node biopsy and targeted axillary dissection. SLNB removes the sentinel nodes, the first lymph nodes in the drainage path from the breast tumor, while TAD removes specific lymph nodes known to contain cancer.

“Randomized controlled trials have demonstrated safety of sentinel node biopsy omission in early-stage cancers,” Krell stated. “Minimizing unnecessary axillary surgery should translate into improved patient survivorship.” Dr. Sonali Rudra, director of the Breast Cancer Radiation Oncology Program at MedStar Georgetown University School of Medicine, agreed, adding that increasing data supports less invasive approaches. She explained that in “the era of de-escalation,” radiation treatment planning is shifting toward lower doses to reduce toxicity and protect critical organs, especially for early-stage cancers with favorable prognoses.

A breast cancer diagnosis can also affect sexual health and intimacy, explained Jennifer Reese, associate professor in the Cancer Prevention and Control Program at Temple University School of Medicine’s Fox Chase Cancer Center. “Be open, direct and up front about your wants and needs,” she advised those experiencing breast cancer, emphasizing that clear communication between patients/survivors and their partners is essential with addressing medical and psychological concerns, including depression and anxiety.

U.S. Navy Lt. Cmdr. (Dr.) Allison Eubanks and U.S. Army Maj. Kiley Hunkler, clinical fellows in Reproductive Endocrinology and Infertility at Walter Reed, discussed integrating reproductive planning into cancer care. They encouraged providers to counsel patients about potential infertility risks before treatment and refer them early for fertility preservation options such as oocyte, embryo, or tissue cryopreservation. They noted that TRICARE covers fertility preservation under some conditions and that early coordination helps prevent delays.

Geeta Upadhyay, scientific director of the MCCRP Clinical Breast Care Project, shared her team’s research on targeted therapies for triple negative breast cancer, which does not respond to traditional cancer medication. Her team is investigating how blocking abnormal molecules, or biomarkers, like Ly6K may help the body’s immune system fight cancer more effectively.

Some studies suggest that active-duty women may have a higher rate of developing breast cancer than their civilian peers, potentially linked to cumulative environmental exposures. MCC and MCCRP continue advancing cancer research and treatment to enhance readiness and improve outcomes for military beneficiaries. The annual summit helps in leading these efforts by uniting experts to share discoveries, refine treatment strategies, and strengthen the continuum of care from diagnosis through survivorship.

Together, the bills demonstrate her continued leadership—as a nurse practitioner, veteran, and military spouse—in advancing patient-centered, bipartisan healthcare solutions.

“As someone who has cared for patients throughout my career, I know how confusing, expensive, and frustrating prescription drug access can be,” said Congresswoman Kiggans. “These bipartisan bills cut red tape, expand choice, and make it easier for military families and seniors to get the medications they rely on. Healthcare should work for people—not the other way around.”

Rx ACCESS Act

The Rx ACCESS Act, introduced with Reps. Maggie Goodlander (D-NH), Morgan Luttrell (R-TX), and Chrissy Houlahan (D-PA), strengthens access for TRICARE beneficiaries by restoring pharmacy choice, protecting independent pharmacies from unfair reimbursement practices, and increasing transparency across TRICARE’s pharmacy contractor system. Beginning in 2026, beneficiaries would once again be able to fill their maintenance medications through retail pharmacies, mail order, or military treatment facilities.

The bill has already earned support from leading military and veteran advocates, including Tragedy Assistance Program for Survivors (TAPS), National Military Family Association (NMFA), and The American Legion, and National Community Pharmacists Association.

“Over 900,000 Texans are currently enrolled in TRICARE, which can cost our veterans upwards of 250 times more for a drug they desperately need,” said Congressman Luttrell. “Our service members, veterans, and their families should never pay more for the same medications as everyone else. I applaud Rep. Kiggans for this legislation which provides essential congressional oversight to ensure fairness and accountability for our heroes and their loved ones.”

“Military families shouldn’t have to jump through hoops to get the medications they rely on,” said Besa Pinchotti, CEO of NMFA. “We’re grateful to Rep. Jen Kiggans for stepping up with the Rx ACCESS Act to make that happen.”

“The American Legion has consistently advocated for TRICARE pharmacy benefits that are fair, affordable, and accessible,” said Dan Wiley, National Commander of The American Legion. “We thank Representative Kiggans for introducing this critical legislation.”

Read the RX Access Act here and one-pager here.

Increasing Medication Access for Seniors Act of 2025

Kiggans also introduced the Increasing Medication Access for Seniors Act of 2025 with Congressman Raja Krishnamoorthi (D-IL). The legislation helps Medicare beneficiaries better access the new Medicare Prescription Payment Plan, which allows seniors to spread high annual drug costs over 12 months interest-free. While the program began in January 2025, very few seniors are aware of it, and fewer than 0.05% have enrolled—even though many would benefit from lower upfront costs.

“I’m proud to co-lead this bipartisan effort to ensure seniors can actually access the Medicare prescription drug payment options already available to them. Too many older Americans on fixed incomes don’t know they can spread high drug costs over the year, interest-free. By improving data and outreach, this bill will help more seniors take advantage of a benefit that can make their medications more affordable,” said Congressman Krishnamoorthi.

This legislation was endorsed by Genetic Alliance, PXE International, Lupus and Allied Diseases Association, Inc., Arthritis Foundation, HIV+Hepatitis Policy Institute, Neuropathy Action Foundation, PAN Foundation, Triage Cancer, Organic Acidemia Association, Lupus Foundation of America, Alpha-1 Foundation, National Association of Nutrition and Aging Services Programs (NANASP), and Alliance for Aging Research.

Keep Up With Changes to Your Benefits Want to know about changes in military benefits as they happen?","Rates are going up steeply for health insurance under the Federal Employee Health Benefits program (FEHB) for the second year in a row, an average increase of 12.3% in 2026, following 2025’s average increase of 13.5%.

That means federal employees, including military veterans who work for the federal government, need to review their health insurance plans during this year’s open season more than ever, according to the National Active and Retired Federal Employees Association (NARFE).

And they need to go online and do it now, since open enrollment for 2026 ends Dec. 8, 2025.

Doing so -- and adopting a new strategy such as taking more risk on a higher deductible or out-of-pocket limit -- could save federal beneficiaries thousands of dollars in 2026, said John Hatton, NARFE’s staff vice president for policy and programs, in an interview with Military.com.

Read More: Tricare and FEDVIP Open Seasons: What You Need to Know

The consecutive increases may be influencing FEHB users’ selections during the ongoing open enrollment.

In a survey by NARFE, only 50% of federal employees said they intended to stick with their current health plans in 2026, a 30% reduction from 2025 and “a potential reflection of changing plans and increasing costs,” according to the association.

A spike is likely significant considering that generally, “people would rather parse out the meaning of Shakespeare,” Hatton said. Comparing health plans is “very complex. It’s daunting. It’s overwhelming.”

But this year, for those who haven’t perused the new plans, the effort could pay off substantially.

“Because they’ve decided not to look … they’re leaving potentially thousands of dollars on the table,” Hatton said.

Beneficiaries who paid the most in the past for the best coverage or the lowest deductibles might reconsider that strategy, Hatton said.

FEHB plans are all “comprehensive,” Hatton said, meaning, for the most part, “it’s going to cover health conditions that you have.” Once you know you have “good comprehensive coverage for what may come … then it becomes about how much risk are you taking on the deductible or on that out-of-pocket limit.”

At the 2026 rates, he suspects that “not everybody needs the lowest-deductible plan … with the most extensive coverage for everything under the sun.” Even if just for a year, “it’s reasonable to pay a lot less in premiums and still have good coverage.”

The savings might amount to hundreds if not “thousands of dollars a month,” Hatton said.

Open enrollment for FEHB ends at 11:59 p.m. in the location of the beneficiary’s electronic enrollment system on Monday, Dec. 8, 2025.

The Non-Opioids Prevent Addiction in the Nation (NOPAIN) for Veterans Act (S.3209) would expand access for veterans by directing the VA to include FDA-approved non-opioid treatments in the VA National Formulary (VANF). The NOPAIN for Veterans Act would help put veterans on par with the care offered today to Medicare beneficiaries.

“It’s important that veterans have access to more pain treatment options beyond being prescribed opioids, which too often lead to misuse, addiction, and loss of life. The NOPAIN for Veterans Act would allow veterans to use proven non-opioid alternatives, which is why I support it wholeheartedly,” Senator Hyde-Smith said.

S.3209 was introduced by U.S. Senator Shelley Moore Capito (R-W.Va.), who has worked to expand access to non-opioid alternatives in response to the recent opioid overdose epidemic.

“Our veterans deserve the very best care we can provide, including safe and effective options to manage pain without exposing them to unnecessary risk,” Senator Capito said. “By ensuring FDA-approved non-opioid treatments are included on the VA National Formulary, our legislation will make these alternatives easier to prescribe and easier for veterans to access.”

S.3209 would build on the NOPAIN Act passed by Congress in 2022, which expanded Medicare enrollee access to non-opioid alternatives for postoperative pain. While TRICARE traditionally follows the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services policies on these matters, the VA has not taken similar action to expand access to non-opioid treatments through the VANF.

The VANF lists clinically reviewed products available for prescribing at all VA facilities, but any products or treatments not included on that formulary cannot be used without going through a “non-formulary request process.”",https://picayuneitem.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/27/2025/09/Hyde-Smith.jpg,N,0.0,2025-12-03 18:57:15.235936

Of the eligible military hospitals participating in the grading assessment, 90% received an ""A"" grade.
[Walter Reed National Military Medical Center](https://walterreed.tricare.mil/) was the first military test site for Leapfrog surveys.
2025 marks the first time certain military hospitals overseas qualified to receive an official safety grade.
“We hope these latest Hospital Safety Grades inspire our patients’ confidence in the quality and safety of care they receive,” said Cordts.","The [Defense Health Agency](https://www.dha.mil/) announced 18 military hospitals received an ""A"" rating in the [Leapfrog Hospital Safety Grade](https://www.hospitalsafetygrade.org/) assessment for fall 2025. These high grades reflect DHA’s commitment to transparency and continuous improvement in providing high-quality care to its patients.

“These ratings underscore the strength of our integrated Military Health System and the unwavering commitment of our teams to safe, high-quality care,” said Air Force Maj. Gen. Jeannine Ryder, DHA’s acting assistant director for Health Care Administration. “When our hospitals perform at this level, it reinforces trust — trust from our patients, our families, and the service members who rely on us to sustain readiness at home and abroad. This achievement reflects disciplined processes and a continuous focus on improvement across every military treatment facility.”

The Leapfrog Group is a national, independent organization focused on health care quality. The organization evaluates hospitals on a wide range of safety measures, including errors, injuries, and infections. Leapfrog's grading system uses up to 22 evidence-based measures of patient safety.

A hospital must meet specific criteria to be eligible for participation in the Leapfrog safety assessment. In the Fall 2025 ratings, 32% of participating hospitals nationwide received the highest grade. Of the eligible military hospitals participating in the grading assessment, 90% received an ""A"" grade.

“I am incredibly proud that a record number of our military hospitals have received an A grade this fall,” said Dr. Paul Cordts, DHA’s deputy assistant director for Medical Affairs and chief medical officer. “Participation in Leapfrog’s Hospital Safety Grade program provides a welcome opportunity to evaluate and improve health care across DHA’s global system of military hospitals and clinics.”

DHA’s engagement with Leapfrog began about eight years ago when it sought to incorporate Leapfrog's evaluations into the Military Health System's Quality Assurance Program. [Walter Reed National Military Medical Center](https://walterreed.tricare.mil/) was the first military test site for Leapfrog surveys. After seeing positive results, DHA expanded the program across other eligible military hospitals. 2025 marks the first time certain military hospitals overseas qualified to receive an official safety grade.

“We hope these latest Hospital Safety Grades inspire our patients’ confidence in the quality and safety of care they receive,” said Cordts. “This distinction belongs to teams of professionals at these military hospitals, who are dedicated to meeting the highest safety standards in the United States.”

The Leapfrog Hospital Safety Grade program, updated twice a year, evaluates public and private hospitals. Its grades are based on national standards for hospital safety and highlight risks that patients may face in a health care setting, including preventable medical errors and infections. The ratings are available to the public, making it easier for patients to understand the safety standards of their local health care facilities.

The 18 military hospitals that received an “A” grade for Fall 2025 are:

“DHA’s fall 2025 ’A’ Hospital Safety Grades demonstrate a nationally recognized achievement for prioritizing quality health care and patient safety,” said Cordts. “We are proud that the care provided at these hospitals ranks among the very best in the nation.”

Some military hospitals and clinics were not included in the safety grades this fall because they did not meet the minimum requirements for reporting criteria used by Leapfrog.

The Army Criminal Investigations Division opened an investigation into alleged offenses by Maj. Blaine McGraw in October at Fort Hood, Tex.after a complaint was filed against him. Last month, Tripler announced that it was notifying patients seen by McGraw in the Obstetrics and Gynecology Service between June 2019 and June 2023 of the investigation. The medical center said patients would be provided resources to learn about the investigation, file concerns, get answers to questions, and arrange medical care and other support.

In a letter to Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth, Acting Inspector General Steven Stebbin and Secretary of the Army Daniel Driscoll, the delegation — U.S. Sens. Mazie Hirono and Brian Schatz and U.S. Reps. Ed Case and Jill Tokuda, all D-Hawaii — called the damage done by McGraw’s alleged actions “irreversible.”

“Major McGraw was entrusted with caring for active-duty service members and military spouses,” they wrote. “The Department owes these victims accountability for its failure to stop this misconduct, including a comprehensive investigation and, where supported by the evidence, prosecution of Major McGraw under the Uniform Code of Military Justice to the fullest extent allowed.”

McGraw served a medical residency at Tripler from 2019 to 2023 before moving on to Fort Hood. The residence included “mandatory and elective clinical rotations” at civilian facilities, the lawmakers noted.

“The trust of service members and the community they serve must be continually earned,” the letter stated. “Therefore, we urge the Department of Defense to move swiftly and thoroughly in the investigation to address these allegations. Any investigation must also be conducted with special care by department investigators to protect the rights of patients and victims and follow federal privacy laws.”

The lawmakers also urged the DoD’s inspector general to conduct an inquiry into how the Army and DoD, the Defense Health Agency and McGraw’s supervisors failed to stop the alleged criminal actions from occurring. The inquiry would also include an assessment and recommendations for potential systemic improvements to prevent future abuses.

In addition, the lawmakers requested a joint briefing within six months to update the status of the investigation and any reform plan.

The letter included a series of questions regarding trauma-informed resources and support services for affected patients, notification to appropriate institutions regarding McGraw’s alleged misconduct and subsequent suspension, and the DoD’s commitment to identifying and assessing systemic failures that allowed McGraw to engage in his alleged misconduct.",https://s7d2.scene7.com/is/image/TWCNews/TriplerAMC_Tripler_HI_1202,N,0.0,2025-12-03 13:56:45.836020

The lawmakers continued, “The trust of servicemembers and the community they serve must be continually earned. Therefore, we urge the Department of Defense to move swiftly and thoroughly in the investigation to address these allegations.”

The full text of their letter can be found below and is available here.

Secretary Hegseth, Secretary Driscoll, and Acting Inspector General Stebbins,

We write with grave concern regarding the recent allegations of Army obstetrician-gynecologist (OBGYN) Major Blaine D. McGraw. As you know, Major McGraw is alleged to have assaulted and exploited potentially thousands of former patients, including in Hawai‘i – violating the basic principles of medical practice. Major McGraw’s alleged actions run completely counter to the expected conduct of an U.S. Army officer and physician.

Given the extent of these allegations, the Army Criminal Investigation Division’s (CID) investigation into Major McGraw’s conduct must be extremely thorough. Major McGraw’s medical residency at Tripler Army Medical Center spanned from 2019 to 2023. His residency also included mandatory and elective clinical rotations at civilian institutions. It is critical that Army CID and the Defense Health Agency (DHA) thoroughly review all patient complaints associated with his postings at Tripler Army Medical Center and Fort Hood.

The damage done by Major McGraw’s alleged actions is irreversible. Major McGraw was entrusted with caring for active-duty servicemembers and military spouses. The Department owes these victims accountability for its failure to stop this misconduct, including a comprehensive investigation and, where supported by the evidence, prosecution of Major McGraw under the Uniform Code of Military Justice to the fullest extent allowed.

The trust of servicemembers and the community they serve must be continually earned. Therefore, we urge the Department of Defense to move swiftly and thoroughly in the investigation to address these allegations. Any investigation must also be conducted with special care by Department investigators to protect the rights of patients and victims and follow federal privacy laws.

Furthermore, we urge the Department of Defense Office of Inspector General (DoD IG) to conduct an urgent inquiry into how the Army and the Department of Defense, the Defense Health Agency, and Major McGraw’s supervisors failed to stop these alleged actions from occurring. The DoD IG should also provide an assessment and recommendations of potential systemic improvements to ensure that this type of misconduct never occurs again.

We also ask the Department of Defense, Department of the Army, and the Defense Health Agency to provide a joint briefing within six months to update our offices on the current status and any reform plan concerning the Department’s actions regarding Major McGraw’s alleged conduct and the systemic failures that contributed to the alleged conduct.

We further request answers to the following questions:

Will the Department commit to a thorough investigation of all patient complaints regarding Major Blaine D. McGraw?

What external and internal trauma-informed resources and support services will the Department and Army provide to former patients and their families during and after the investigation?

How will Army CID’s investigation uphold federal privacy protections of Major McGraw’s former patients, while also ensuring alleged victims can provide valuable testimony and evidence to investigators?

Has the Department and Army notified the Hawai‘i Medical Board of the suspension and active criminal investigation of Major McGraw?

Has the Department notified civilian medical institutions where Major McGraw practiced during his postings at Tripler Army Medical Center and Fort Hood of its CID investigation and extended resources and support services to their potentially impacted patients?

Will the Department commit to identifying and assessing any systemic failures that allowed Major McGraw to engage in this alleged behavior for as long as alleged? Will the DoD also commit to providing information on how it will address these failures?

Will the Department conduct a review of the Defense Health Agency’s Graduate Medical Education (GME) programs?

Will the Department commit to investigating any medical providers who supervised Major McGraw or may have had knowledge of the alleged misconduct?

What programs, policies and procedures will the Department and DoD IG review to ensure that victims of sexual assault or misconduct by physicians and other medical providers feel empowered to file complaints and that their complaint will be taken seriously?

Sincerely,

Spouses, survivors, and dependents who rely on CHAMPVA (the Civilian Health and Medical Program of the Department of Veterans Affairs) have often faced long processing delays just to get access to basic, essential health coverage.

Now, for the first time in a long time, there’s genuinely good news … The VA has eliminated the CHAMPVA application backlog entirely.

This milestone doesn’t just clear paperwork — it clears a path for thousands of veteran families to finally secure the health care they’ve been waiting on.

What Exactly Is CHAMPVA?

CHAMPVA provides health-care coverage for spouses, survivors, and dependents of certain disabled or deceased veterans. For many families, it fills the gap when they don’t qualify for TRICARE but still rely on VA-connected benefits to access medical care, specialists, prescriptions, and emergency services.

When CHAMPVA slows down, families feel it instantly — everything from specialist referrals to prescription coverage can hang in the balance.

What Caused the Backlog in the First Place?

Several factors built up the delays over time:

A surge in applications linked to expanded eligibility and awareness

Outdated systems that weren’t designed for modern volume

High demand following major legislative expansions such as PACT Act implementation

Staffing shortages in application-processing units

While veteran-facing backlogs often receive attention, family backlogs rarely make headlines — even though the impact is just as real.

How the VA Cleared the Backlog

According to the VA, the department implemented new steps to accelerate processing:

Hiring and reassigning staff to family-health–benefit divisions

Streamlining internal review processes to reduce unnecessary redundancies

Digitizing and modernizing portions of the CHAMPVA application workflow

Cross-team operations similar to those used to reduce the veterans’ claims backlog

These improvements allowed the VA to move from thousands of pending applications to zero — something family advocates have been hoping to see for almost a decade.

What This Means for Veteran Families Right Now

With the backlog eliminated, families can expect:

Faster Application Decisions

Most CHAMPVA applications should now process significantly more quickly, with wait times dropping from months to, in many cases, weeks.

Quicker Access to Specialists and Prescriptions

Once enrolled, beneficiaries can tap into covered services without the administrative limbo that previously delayed care.

Less Financial Strain

Families no longer need to pay out-of-pocket or delay essential treatment while waiting for confirmation of coverage.

Greater Stability

For surviving spouses or caregivers, CHAMPVA isn’t just a benefit — it’s a lifeline, especially for those facing long-term medical conditions.

A Quiet Victory With Big Ripples …

This milestone doesn’t solve every family-care challenge in the VA ecosystem, but it represents meaningful movement toward a more modern, more humane support system.

It also signals something important:

Veteran support isn’t only veteran-focused — it’s family-focused. And when family care improves, veterans thrive right alongside them.

Final Thoughts …

Clearing the CHAMPVA backlog isn’t just a bureaucratic win — it’s a quality-of-life win. It means spouses get medication sooner, children get specialists faster, and survivors get the peace of mind they deserve.

While more modernization is still needed across the VA’s family-care programs, this achievement shows what’s possible when efficiency, urgency, and compassion align.

Veterans serve as individuals, but they sacrifice as families — and when the system responds with this kind of momentum, everyone moves forward together.",https://www.disabledveterans.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/110-CHAMPVA-Backlog-Feature-Image.png,N,0.0,2025-12-03 10:57:08.010331

Kara Kenan, a disabled U.S. Air Force Veteran due to breast cancer diagnosis, received the Breast Cancer Index test after experiencing side effects from anti-estrogen therapy during the first five years after breast cancer treatment.","The Breast Cancer Research Program plays a leading role in the fight against breast cancer by funding innovative research that will bring an end to the disease. Female breast cancer accounted for the highest cancer incidence rate for the ten leading cancers among active-duty members of the military between 2018 and 2022. Innovative research funded by the BCRP contributes to high-impact advances in clinical practice and treatment used within the Military Health System. Continued breast cancer research gives hope to current and future members of the military, and helps warfighters stay mission-ready while knowing their families receive the best care available.

According to data provided by the Defense Medical Surveillance System of the Defense Health Agency, on average, the Military Health System provided care for 67,739 women and 507 men for invasive breast cancer annually between 2015 and 2024, including an average of 420 active-duty military members each year. For females 40-59 years of age, the incidence rate of breast cancer is higher in service members compared to the general population.

Environmental Exposures and Breast Cancer Risk Among Military Women

Throughout their service, members of the military may experience environmental exposures to substances that can increase the risk of developing cancer. The Department of Veterans Affairs recognizes female breast cancer as a presumptive cancer related to burn pit exposure.

In fiscal year 2019, the BCRP funded a Breakthrough Award – Funding Level 2 – Population Science and Prevention Studies – Partnering Principal Investigator Option, led by Celia Byrne, Ph.D., at the Uniformed Services University of the Health Sciences, and Mary Beth Terry, Ph.D., at Columbia University, to investigate the association between environmental exposures and breast cancer risk for women serving in the military.

“For our project, CDMRP funding has been critical in supporting research into the reasons why young, active-duty military women are experiencing an increase in early onset breast cancer,” Byrne and Terry said. “CDMRP’s emphasis on the need for innovative and novel approaches to studying breast cancer risk allowed us to design a study to evaluate the impact of environmental determinants of breast cancer and the potential for impact of exposures that, while common in the civilian population, may be more prevalent with military service.”

Byrne and Terry’s study builds on existing resources within the Department of Defense. The team identifies cases of breast cancer diagnoses in active-duty women using the DOD’s Cancer Registry, a registry documenting tumors and cancers across the Military Health System. Then, the researchers obtain pre-diagnostic serum samples from the same individuals through the DOD’s Serum Repository, which stores blood samples collected from active-duty military members. To date, the researchers identified over 850 breast cancer cases from the cancer repository.

By combining biospecimens and other data, including genetic information and blood-based biomarkers of environmental exposures, the researchers aim to answer longstanding questions regarding potential associations between environmental exposures and risk of breast cancer in specific populations.

“Rather than only looking at genetic factors alone, we must consider how women at higher genetic risk of developing breast cancer might be more susceptible to the influences of these environmental exposures,” Byrne and Terry said.

Triple-Negative Breast Cancer Vaccine Advances to Clinical Trials

Triple-negative breast cancer, an aggressive subtype associated with fast-growing tumors that often spread to other parts of the body, accounts for approximately 10-20% of all breast cancers. This subtype represents a larger proportion of breast cancers among younger women, including the age range for active-duty military service, compared to other age groups. Triple-negative breast cancer lacks estrogen receptors, progesterone receptors and large amounts of HER2/neu protein commonly used as targets for the treatment of other breast cancer subtypes, limiting treatment options.

In fiscal year 2016, the BCRP funded a Breakthrough Award – Funding Level 3 – Clinical Trial – Partnering Principal Investigator Option, led by the late Vincent Tuohy, Ph.D., George Budd, M.D., and Thaddeus Stappenbeck, M.D., Ph.D., at the Cleveland Clinic, to conduct a phase 1 clinical trial testing a vaccine for triple-negative breast cancer. The vaccine generates an immune response to alpha-lactalbumin, a milk protein expressed in the breast during late pregnancy and lactation. Most triple-negative breast cancers express high levels of alpha-lactalbumin, making this protein a potential target for treatment or prevention.

The investigators aim to determine the best dose and safety of the vaccine in females recently diagnosed with triple-negative breast cancer who recovered from current standard of care therapy. The researchers also test the vaccine in healthy subjects who elected prophylactic mastectomy because of their familial risk for breast cancer. “CDMRP's BCRP has been a vital source of funding for studies of novel approaches to breast cancer treatment and prevention,” Budd said. “Thanks to the CDMRP, we have been able to perform a first-in-human trial of a vaccine designed to prevent or treat breast cancer.”

With an early phase clinical trial underway, the research team’s work will inform the next set of clinical trials, demonstrating potential to move new treatments and preventative approaches to patients.

Improving Care in the Military Health System

Since the program’s inception in 1992, BCRP-funded research contributed to the development of digital mammography and digital breast tomosynthesis, also known as 3D mammogram, now adopted as the standard of care for breast imaging and breast cancer detection across all health care sectors, including those where service members and their families seek care.

According to data provided by the DHA Pharmacy Operations Division, Military Health Service providers filled more than 132,900 prescriptions between 2007 and 2024 for FDA-approved drugs developed in part by BCRP-funded research: abemaciclib, palbociclib, ribociclib and trastuzumab.

In 2023, the DHA expanded a genetic testing pilot program for service members and their families to include the Breast Cancer Index®. Research funded by the BCRP contributed to the development of this prognostic test that evaluates the likelihood of recurrence and benefit from extended anti-estrogen therapy.

Kara Kenan, a disabled U.S. Air Force Veteran due to breast cancer diagnosis, received the Breast Cancer Index test after experiencing side effects from anti-estrogen therapy during the first five years after breast cancer treatment. “I finally had the Breast Cancer Index test, which indicated I wasn't really getting any additional benefit from continuing on hormonal treatments. I was able to come off of [the treatment], and my body was really grateful because that treatment was really difficult.” Kenan said.

Kenan served as a fiscal year 2024 BCRP peer reviewer, sharing her experiences to help ensure funded research addresses the concerns and need of patients, including service members and Veterans.

“I think we are in a renaissance of what is happening with cancer treatments and diagnostics,” Kenan said. “There's so much going on right now, and it is all so very exciting.”",https://www.dha.mil/-/media/Project/Images/News-Images/8682401.jpg,N,0.0,2025-12-03 09:56:44.916659

The sharp decline is attributed to President Donald Trump’s reversal of Biden-era policies that expanded access to abortions, according to Defense Health Agency records released this month.

The data, disclosed November 20 in response to a Freedom of Information Act request, shows TRICARE recorded just two abortions through June 11, 2025 — compared with 35 for all of 2021 under Biden.

The figures reflect abortions “performed or funded consistent with Title 10, United States Code, Section 1093,” the agency said, a federal law that strictly limits taxpayer-funded abortions to very rare instances of rape, incest or when the mother’s life is endangered.

The downturn follows Trump’s January executive orders to “end the use of Federal taxpayer dollars to fund or promote elective abortion” and dismantle what the Trump admin called the prior administration’s “whole-of-government effort to promote and fund abortion.”

Pro-life advocates hailed the numbers as evidence of renewed commitment to protecting unborn life in the armed forces.

“We know that the Biden administration used every lever at its disposal to push unlimited abortion and this included policy changes in the military. Under the Trump administration, policies pushing abortion have been nullified or reversed,” the National Right to Life Committee said in a statement.

The pro-life organization emphasized the clarity of longstanding federal restrictions, noting, “The law is very clear: taxpayer dollars and military facilities cannot be used for elective abortions. When that standard is followed and enforced, it naturally limits the number of abortions performed.”

National Right to Life also credited the military’s inherent values with bolstering family support amid the policy shift.

“We know the military community has a strong culture of service, mutual responsibility, and support for families,” the group said, adding that priorities like expanded conscience protections for medical personnel and enhanced reporting requirements continue to safeguard life-affirming choices.

Among these, 54,553 (56%) occurred between 2016 and 2019 compared with 43,597 between 2020 and 2023, demonstrating a steady decline in low-value surgical intervention over time.

The study had several limitations, including an inability to identify the causal factors driving differences in low-value surgical care across environments.","Health care systems and patients may benefit from shifting from fee-for-service (FFS) reimbursement models to salaried payment structures, according to a new study published in JAMA Network Open.¹

The findings align with prior research demonstrating that low-value care is less common in larger, integrated health systems. Low-value care often results from varying physician and patient beliefs, lack of ideal clinical approaches, or strong patient preferences. These factors may lead physicians to recommend surgical interventions that offer limited benefit based on a patient’s current clinical state. Unnecessary procedures increase costs and pose risks of complications or adverse events—issues that tend to be more pronounced in FFS environments.¹

Although many physicians paid under FFS models—such as those reimbursed by CMS—participate in value-based care initiatives, incentives can vary. Programs such as the Hospital Readmissions Reduction Program penalize excessive 30-day readmissions for conditions like heart failure or pneumonia, encouraging hospitals and clinicians to critically evaluate treatment pathways.²˒³ However, these programs overlay, rather than replace, the core FFS structure.

The study analyzed TRICARE health care claims within the US Military Health System (MHS) from 2016 to 2023. A total of 304,908 surgical procedures were initially identified; the most common was partial meniscectomy (42%), followed by acromioplasty (29%).¹ Additional procedures included rotator cuff repair and wrist or ankle arthroscopy. Well-defined literature was used to identify the selected procedures as frequent markers of low-value surgical care.

Patients 10 years and older who underwent outpatient surgery were included. Those with diagnoses of infection, tumor, or trauma at the time of surgery were excluded. The mean patient age was 47.2 years, and 189,648 (62%) were male patients. Of them, 12% identified as Black, 57% as White, and 8% as other race.

Overall, 98,150 procedures (32%) met criteria for low-value care. Among these, 54,553 (56%) occurred between 2016 and 2019 compared with 43,597 between 2020 and 2023, demonstrating a steady decline in low-value surgical intervention over time.

The final analytic cohort included 233,133 procedures with complete data for regression analyses. Procedures performed in private-sector care (FFS) had significantly higher odds of meeting low-value criteria (OR, 1.41; 95% CI, 1.38-1.45; P < .001).¹

The odds of low-value care were higher between 2016 and 2019 than between 2020 and 2023 across both care sectors (direct care: OR, 0.78; 95% CI, 0.73-0.83; P < .001; private sector: OR, 0.93; 95% CI, 0.91-0.96; P < .001). Furthermore, outpatient procedures performed in the private sector consistently demonstrated higher odds of low-value care compared with direct care in both time periods.

The study had several limitations, including an inability to identify the causal factors driving differences in low-value surgical care across environments. Also, the second analysis excluded active-duty service members, which limits generalizability. Additionally, researchers could not evaluate nonpayment-related factors—such as surgical practice culture, access to specialists, or evolving clinical guidelines—that may also influence low-value care rates.

“Changing the reimbursement model from FFS to salaried may be associated with as much as a 41% change in the odds of low-value surgical intervention,” the authors concluded.¹",https://cdn.sanity.io/images/0vv8moc6/ajmc/7eae1e4402fbd993cbaac0464bf6ef9efde92868-3565x2673.jpg,N,0.0,2025-12-02 18:56:54.931248
