“And as those young people reach the age where they’re eligible for military service, or the military is competing with private industry and all sorts of organizations for these young people.
Pennsylvania is home to more than 2,500 active-duty military members, and more than 111,000 veterans and military contractors.
Joan Alker, executive director, Georgetown University Center for Children and Families, said Medicaid is vital for service members whose kids need more complex medical care.
He added Medicaid cuts would also affect veterans and their families, since around 50% of young people in the nation currently use Medicaid for their health coverage.","As Republican lawmakers consider cutting billions of dollars in Medicaid services, a new report reveals the proposed reductions could affect thousands of military families in Pennsylvania. The Georgetown University Center for Children and Families says more than 850,000 people with TRICARE, the military’s health insurance, also rely on Medicaid.

Retired Army Brigadier General George Schwartz points out that one in 10 children of active-duty military depends on Medicaid for additional health coverage, and warns that without proper coverage for their families, service members may leave the military for careers with better benefits, which would affect recruitment.

“And as those young people reach the age where they’re eligible for military service, or the military is competing with private industry and all sorts of organizations for these young people. And so that, from a mission readiness standpoint, this is a matter of national security,” he explained.

Pennsylvania is home to more than 2,500 active-duty military members, and more than 111,000 veterans and military contractors. The budget reconciliation bill is in the Senate with a vote expected by the end of June. Republicans are pushing for $2 trillion in federal spending cuts.

Medicaid also serves 40% of children in the United States with a benefit that allows them to receive preventive and ameliorative care.

Joan Alker, executive director, Georgetown University Center for Children and Families, said Medicaid is vital for service members whose kids need more complex medical care.

“The TRICARE benefit package just isn’t enough, so Medicaid is making TRICARE work for those families by covering the high cost of services and some benefits that those children otherwise would not have access to,” she explained.

Schwartz served in both the Army Reserve and the Army National Guard and said most of his military experience has been as a citizen soldier. He added Medicaid cuts would also affect veterans and their families, since around 50% of young people in the nation currently use Medicaid for their health coverage.

“I am very concerned that this could affect those citizen soldiers too, because it was only since 911 that TRICARE was extended to reservists and National Guardsmen because it was viewed as a matter of improving the readiness of the reserve components,” he continued.

According to the report, an estimated 3.4 million children of veterans depend on Medicaid for their health-care coverage.",https://heartlandsignal.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/gr-97062-1-1-scaled.jpg,N,0.0,2025-06-05 19:56:19.381514

For one patient, the clinic made nine prosthetic fingers. This was a complex and costly procedure and months after providing the prosthetic fingers, the clinic had trouble getting paid by the insurance company.

Humana Military, a contractor for TRICARE East, approved the procedure before the clinic moved forward with the treatment. Carolyn Hicks, the patient care coordinator at The Anaplastology Clinic showed ABC11 the official documentation confirming all nine fingers were authorized. Still, once the work was done and the prostheses were delivered, payment didn't follow.

""They've denied it many times,"" Hicks told ABC11 Troubleshooter Diane Wilson. ""We've called, I've got reference numbers and everything stating that, at one point, they said they never received the invoice, they never received the office notes, and we have submitted them many times.""

They did receive a check for about $1,600, but that only covered a small portion of what they were owed. ""It's almost $60,000,"" said Hicks. ""We're a very small practice here, so this has really impacted our money flow that comes into the building.""

After seeing a similar story ABC11 had covered, Office Manager Taffy Jones called the Troubleshooter team. ""I thought we need help too,"" Jones said. ""So I'm like, I'm calling Diane.""

ABC11 Troubleshooter Diane Wilson contacted Humana Military. While the company did not respond directly, a notice was posted on their website at the time that acknowledged claim processing delays due to a major system transition and stated they were working to expedite resolutions. Just a week and a half after ABC11 got involved, Jones says the clinic received a full payment of about $56,000. ""We really thank you for it,"" Jones said. ""Because I don't think we would have gotten it resolved if it hadn't been for you.""

While the clinic is relieved this long-standing claim was finally paid, they're still waiting on reimbursements from other insurance providers for additional claims dating back more than a year.

He’s now running 100 miles a week, taking part in marathons, and remains on active duty with the U.S. Air Force.

Often called the hidden disease of recent battlefields, any TBI can bring on balance, vision, and hearing injuries, which can be very difficult to detect and diagnose.

There could be “multiple different medical disciplines that are involved” in diagnosing and treating a service member with suspected TBI, said Chrystyna Rakoczy, an optometrist who has worked with TBI-injured service members since 2009 at the Defense Health Agency’s Vision Center of Excellence and the Department of Veterans Affairs James A. Haley Veterans' Hospital in Tampa, Florida. These experts diagnose through painstaking and thorough detective work that is individual to each patient.

“The dysfunctions that are caused by TBI you have to proactively look for,” explained Rakoczy. “The symptoms are not obvious, and routine testing does not easily elicit these dysfunctions.”

Airman’s Medical Issues

After he experienced a 30-meter fall in a parachute-training accident, “the airman had a lot of difficulty walking a straight line, he couldn't run anymore, he couldn’t move his head without getting dizzy or having his vision blurred, and he was having difficulty sleeping,” Rakoczy recalled. Over time, he also developed numbing pain in his hands and shoulder problems.

The airman dealt with sensory problems for a decade while he sought help for his symptoms.

“He had seen a number of ophthalmologists, neuro-ophthalmologists, neurologists, [and] optometrists,” Rakoczy said. “Eventually, they all sent him to psychiatry, and [he] was put on medications for mood and sleep disorders.”

‘Very Diagnosis-Driven Evaluation’

No single strategy works for TBI recovery, according to Rakoczy. “You have to work individually with every patient, and it has to be a multisensory approach; it has to be interdisciplinary teams working together.”

After an initial review at Tampa, the airman was diagnosed with a continuing mild TBI.

A physical therapy team found he had “benign positional paroxysmal vertigo, which is basically a dislocation of the otoliths within the inner ear canal,” Rakoczy said. Otoliths are gravity-sensitive organs that help orient your body’s awareness of space and movement.

A common symptom of BPPV is a spinning sensation (vertigo) or dizziness, triggered when the head is moved into certain positions.

Test Examines Sensory Interactions

A posturography test, which assesses balance by measuring a person's ability to remain in a stable position under different conditions, showed while walking the injured airman “would veer off to one side or another, and that his entire body composition was pretty stiff … he had no ability to right himself,” Rakoczy said.

The test helps to diagnose this type of balance disorder by placing the patient on a platform to evaluate their response to different movements on the platform—inner ear, vision, and touch.

The airman was sensing motion in his sight, but “his body would automatically feel the motion and he would not be able to keep his body in a straight position or in a stable position,” explained Rakoczy. Essentially, he would fall down if not attached to the equipment.

He was treated with the Epley maneuver, a series of simple side-to-side movements of the head while sitting, lying down quickly, and turning over 90 degrees, which can reposition the otoliths.

Vision Team’s Diagnosis

Rakoczy’s vision team examined the airman after he completed the maneuver because he reported continuing visual issues.

His ease in being able to converge and diverge his eyes to focus on a single object “was very poor,” said Rakoczy. Our eyes are constantly diverging and converging, which, when accurate, “gives us a sense of balance,” she said.

After considering all the data gathered through his treatment, including recreational and dance therapy, the vision team prescribed prescription eyeglasses that can bend light in one direction.

At a follow-up session, the airman “was completely normal” with all his vision and balance testing.

“His [eyes’] ability to converge and diverge and his efficiency to converge and diverge had normalized completely,” Rakoczy said. “His headaches went away. He was sleeping better.” He also no longer needed medication, Rakoczy added.

Latest TBI Numbers and Early Identification

TBIs range from mild (concussion) to severe and can happen on- or off-duty.

Stephanie Maxfield Panker, clinical affairs section chief of the DHA’s Traumatic Brain Injury Center of Excellence Research and Engineering Division, who holds doctorates in neuroscience and physical therapy, said there were 515,885 service members diagnosed with TBI between calendar years 2000–2024.

Further insights from a data subset of 135,853 service members diagnosed with first-time TBI between calendar years 2017-2023 illustrate the relationship between TBI diagnosis and vestibular, hearing, and vision issues:

• 26.1%, or 35,449 individuals, reported vestibular-related issues after their TBI diagnosis

• 21.8%, or 29,582 individuals, were diagnosed with hearing-related issues

• 18.9%, or 25,716 individuals, had visual issues

Mild TBIs may result from blows or jolts to the head during motor vehicle accidents, sports, and military training, among other causes. TBIs may resolve quickly, while others linger, depending on the individual, the source of the TBI, the person’s duties in their branch of the military, and the exact location of the injury in their brain.

While the airman’s case was worked up nearly 10 years after his initial TBI diagnosis, service members should report any suspected brain injury as soon as possible to avoid long-term issues.

“Early identification, evaluation, and appropriate management are keys to the best chance for a service member who has sustained a concussion to return to activity and duty as quickly as possible,” Panker said.

A TBICoE comorbidities dashboard for 2017–2019 is published on the CarePoint Information Portal, available via CAC. An updated dashboard with data from 2017 through 2023 is under development.

Fraud and abuse can drive up costs and divert resources. TRICARE is committed to protecting the health information of service members, retirees, and their family members. You can help by knowing how to spot fraud or abuse — and by reporting it when you see it.

“Most TRICARE providers act with honesty and integrity,” said Jennifer Dietz, director of Health Care Fraud Resolution for the Defense Health Agency Office of the Inspector General. “But when fraud or abuse happens, it diverts resources that should be used to provide access to appropriate and quality medical care.”

Here’s what you should know to recognize, report, and help prevent fraud and abuse.

What is fraud?

Fraud happens when a person or organization knowingly deceives TRICARE to gain a benefit -- or payment -- they aren’t entitled to.

Examples of fraud include:

Billing for services that weren’t provided

Falsifying medical records or claims

Misrepresenting services to charge a higher rate

Using someone else’s information

Hiding other health coverage

What is abuse?

Abuse involves improper practices that may or may not be intentional but result in unnecessary costs to TRICARE.

Examples of abuse include:

Waiving copayments or cost-shares without proper documentation

Billing for services that aren’t necessary

Keeping poor or incomplete records

Repeated improper billing practices

Refusing medical record requests

How to spot suspected fraud or abuse

Pay attention if you see anything suspicious or unfamiliar on your bill. One example is if you receive a bill for a service you never received. You should also be cautious if a provider offers you a “free” service but asks for your TRICARE information in return—this could be a scam.

Keep an eye out for duplicate charges for the same procedure, which may signal improper billing. Also, be wary if you feel pressured into accepting treatments or services that weren’t requested. These are all potential signs of fraud or abuse.

Lastly, you should review your explanation of benefits regularly. This is the best way to spot fraud or abuse. Your EOB lists the care you received, what’s been billed, and what TRICARE paid. If something doesn’t match, contact your regional contractor.

How to report fraud or abuse

If you suspect fraud or abuse, report it right away. Here’s how:

Contact your TRICARE contractor:

This may be your TRICARE regional or overseas contractor, TRICARE For Life, TRICARE Pharmacy Program, or TRICARE Dental Program. Visit Report Fraud or Abuse for a complete list of contacts.

Contact the Defense Health Agency Office of the Inspector General:

File a report through the DHA OIG.

When making a report, include as much detail as you can, such as:

Names of providers or organizations involved

Dates of service or incidents

Description of the suspected fraud or abuse

You can choose to remain anonymous. All reports are confidential.

How you can help prevent fraud and abuse

The FBI offers some tips for preventing health care fraud and abuse. To ensure you don’t become a victim of fraud or abuse, you should:

Protect your personal information: Treat your personal information like your Social Security card. Only share it with trusted health care providers.

Be cautious about “free” services: Be wary of anyone offering you free medical equipment, prescriptions, or services in exchange for your TRICARE information.

Review your EOBs and bills carefully: Make sure you recognize all services and charges listed. If you spot an error, first call your provider. If they can’t resolve it, report it to your TRICARE contractor.

Stay informed about common scams: TRICARE will never contact you asking for your Social Security number, banking information, or personal health details over the phone or email.",https://media.defense.gov/2025/Jun/05/2003733094/1920/1080/0/250605-O-D0202-1001.PNG,N,0.0,2025-06-05 18:56:16.226989

“Most TRICARE providers act with honesty and integrity,” said Jennifer Dietz, director of Health Care Fraud Resolution for the Defense Health Agency Office of the Inspector General.
How to report fraud or abuse If you suspect fraud or abuse, report it right away.
Here’s how: • Contact your TRICARE contractor: • This may be your TRICARE regional or overseas contractor, TRICARE For Life, TRICARE Pharmacy Program, or TRICARE Dental Program.
How you can help prevent fraud and abuse The FBI offers some tips for preventing health care fraud and abuse.","Health care fraud and abuse harms everyone. Fraud and abuse can drive up costs and divert resources. TRICARE is committed to protecting the health information of service members, retirees, and their family members. You can help by knowing how to spot fraud or abuse—and by reporting it when you see it.

“Most TRICARE providers act with honesty and integrity,” said Jennifer Dietz, director of Health Care Fraud Resolution for the Defense Health Agency Office of the Inspector General. “But when fraud or abuse happens, it diverts resources that should be used to provide access to appropriate and quality medical care.”

Here’s what you should know to recognize, report, and help prevent fraud and abuse.

What is fraud?

Fraud happens when a person or organization knowingly deceives TRICARE to gain a benefit--or payment--they aren’t entitled to.

Examples of fraud include:

• Billing for services that weren’t provided

• Falsifying medical records or claims

• Misrepresenting services to charge a higher rate

• Using someone else’s information

• Hiding other health coverage

What is abuse?

Abuse involves improper practices that may or may not be intentional but result in unnecessary costs to TRICARE.

Examples of abuse include:

• Waiving copayments or cost-shares without proper documentation

• Billing for services that aren’t necessary

• Keeping poor or incomplete records

• Repeated improper billing practices

• Refusing medical record requests

How to spot suspected fraud or abuse

Pay attention if you see anything suspicious or unfamiliar on your bill. One example is if you receive a bill for a service you never received. You should also be cautious if a provider offers you a “free” service but asks for your TRICARE information in return—this could be a scam.

Keep an eye out for duplicate charges for the same procedure, which may signal improper billing. Also, be wary if you feel pressured into accepting treatments or services that weren’t requested. These are all potential signs of fraud or abuse.

Lastly, you should review your explanation of benefits regularly. This is the best way to spot fraud or abuse. Your EOB lists the care you received, what’s been billed, and what TRICARE paid. If something doesn’t match, contact your regional contractor.

How to report fraud or abuse

If you suspect fraud or abuse, report it right away. Here’s how:

• Contact your TRICARE contractor:

• This may be your TRICARE regional or overseas contractor, TRICARE For Life, TRICARE Pharmacy Program, or TRICARE Dental Program. Visit Report Fraud or Abuse for a complete list of contacts.

• Contact the Defense Health Agency Office of the Inspector General:

• File a report through the DHA OIG.

When making a report, include as much detail as you can, such as:

• Names of providers or organizations involved

• Dates of service or incidents

• Description of the suspected fraud or abuse

You can choose to remain anonymous. All reports are confidential.

How you can help prevent fraud and abuse

The FBI offers some tips for preventing health care fraud and abuse. To ensure you don’t become a victim of fraud or abuse, you should:

• Protect your personal information: Treat your personal information like your Social Security card. Only share it with trusted health care providers.

• Be cautious about “free” services: Be wary of anyone offering you free medical equipment, prescriptions, or services in exchange for your TRICARE information.

• Review your EOBs and bills carefully: Make sure you recognize all services and charges listed. If you spot an error, first call your provider. If they can’t resolve it, report it to your TRICARE contractor.

• Stay informed about common scams: TRICARE will never contact you asking for your Social Security number, banking information, or personal health details over the phone or email.

Your attention helps protect not just your own health information, but also the entire military community. Unlock your health by remaining vigilant. Prevent suspected fraud and abuse by reporting as soon as possible.",https://d1ldvf68ux039x.cloudfront.net/thumbs/photos/2506/9085998/1000w_q95.jpg,N,0.0,2025-06-05 11:56:54.123362

Broadcast version by Danielle Smith for Keystone State News Connection reporting for the Pennsylvania Independent-Public News Service Collaboration

Josie Badger doesn't know where she would be without Medicaid.

""I use a ventilator, power wheelchair,"" said Badger, a disability rights advocate who lives in western Pennsylvania's Lawrence County. ""I have 24-hour care. I could not get out of bed every day without that care, let alone work, have a business, be a foster mom, own a home, any of that. So, without that coverage, Josie would not be here.""

Badger was born with a physical disability called congenital myasthenic syndrome, which leaves an individual with weakened muscles, and she spent months on end in the hospital as a child. While she was growing up, Badger's parents repeatedly considered getting a divorce solely so they could each have their own private insurance plan that Badger could use.

""Fortunately, that didn't happen,"" Badger said of her parents divorcing. ""Now, as an adult, I receive waiver through Medicaid home-based services, and it is my lifeline.""

Now, however, Badger is fighting to keep that lifeline.

In an effort to pay for President Donald Trump's tax cuts for the wealthiest Americans, House Republicans on May 22 passed legislation, which they named the ""One Big Beautiful Bill Act,"" that would carve about $700 billion from Medicaid, add approximately $3.3 trillion to the national debt over the next decade, and cause about 13.7 million people to lose health care coverage nationwide. The bill passed the House by a vote of 215-214, with all but five Republicans voting for it and no Democratic support. Every Republican House member from Pennsylvania supported the bill, which is now before the Senate. Trump is expected to sign the bill if it passes the Senate. If the Senate changes anything in the House bill, the two chambers must work out those differences and vote on the final legislation before sending it to the president.

In Pennsylvania, where close to one-quarter of the population is enrolled in Medicaid, the federal Medicaid cuts could strip health coverage from hundreds of thousands of residents, including people with disabilities, individuals in nursing homes, and children. About 750,000 people with disabilities use Medicaid in Pennsylvania.

""We're at a place where we need to become very public about what's going on, because I don't think enough people realize that these cuts are going to affect them,"" Badger said. ""They don't realize that Medicaid pays for services in schools. They don't realize that the Affordable Care Act that they're buying, those services could go away.""

'I become paralyzed with the fear'

For Badger, a loss of Medicaid or reduced benefits would be life-changing. Currently, she is able to afford six nurses and three home-care attendants who provide around-the-clock services through her Medicaid plan. It's this kind of care that keeps her out of a nursing home and living in her own house with her family, running her own consulting firm, which works to empower people with disabilities, and generally living a life she loves.

As Republicans push for the largest cuts to Medicaid in the program's 60-year history, Badger is trying to focus less on how her own personal life would be affected by the GOP's plan and more on galvanizing people to fight for the public health insurance program that covers about 80 million people nationally, or about 20% of the country's population.

""For me, I can't think a lot about it in terms of my own life because I become paralyzed with the fear, with the anxiety, and so I have to go and activate other folks to get involved,"" Badger said. ""The community is really what keeps me going and realizing why it's important that there's hope. And so a lot of my work time I've been donating towards trying to elevate people's voices for a lot of issues, not just Medicaid. I'm not even sure I can process it on a personal level.""

Should the House bill be signed into law, Badger said, she expects her home caregivers could lose their jobs, or leave them, because of a lack of funding. That, then, could leave older people and people with disabilities with no option but to go into a nursing home.

""Nursing homes, historically, have been last resort, even though they are one of the most expensive options, and so I think that there's going to be a come-to-Jesus moment when we start seeing millions of folks with disabilities and older adults needing care not being able to get it and ending up in nursing homes that are also underfunded,"" Badger said.

Losing home- and community-based services

Jennifer Garman, the president of Disability Rights Pennsylvania, is also deeply worried about cuts to home- and community-based services that are funded by Medicaid, including housing and employment support. Through those services, people with disabilities are able to live in their own homes as well as work.

""We already also have a waiting list for home- and community-based services for people with intellectual disabilities,"" Garman said. ""And so we would also be concerned that waiting lists will grow for services and that people will have to wait a longer time than they're already waiting.""

""It will just be a tremendous strain on the commonwealth and really deeply impact the community and people accessing the services that they need,"" Garman continued.

Cutting or decreasing those services would be disastrous, said Christie Cyktor, the youth leadership and training coordinator for western Pennsylvania at the PEAL Center. The PEAL Center works with youth with disabilities and their families to help them advocate for themselves in a variety of settings, such as school or the workplace.

Cyktor, who has a congenital disability that affects her joints and has used a power wheelchair since the age of 8, explained the youth she works with want to go to college, be in the workforce and live independently. In order for them to do that, they need to have a direct-care worker who helps them with various tasks, depending on their needs, such as dressing themselves, she explained.

Cutting those services would harm people who want to contribute to their families, communities and economy, Cyktor said.

""They want to contribute to the workforce and economy and give back that way, but they're like, How am I going to afford this if I can't fund a direct-care worker?"" Cyktor said.

Cyktor doesn't currently have a direct-care worker, but she did in college, and she said that support allowed her to graduate.

""There's no way that I would have been able to go live independently at college if I did not have this woman,"" Cyktor said. ""She was the sweetest woman and would come in the morning, help me get up, get dressed for the day, get me set up, and I could go do things independently during the day. And then she'd come back at night, and, same thing, sort of helped me get ready for the night and everything. And that enabled me to go get my degree.""

Support at school

Medicaid also funds school-based services, which is the only way that many school districts are able to afford means of support for students with disabilities, such as occupational therapy, nurses, mental health care, and specialized equipment such as wheelchairs.

Cuts to those services could have lifelong consequences for students, Cyktor said. In addition to working at the PEAL Center, Cyktor also provides virtual occupational therapy for students across Pennsylvania.

""So many school-based services are funded by Medicaid, and so it's already something I've sort of been thinking about for these families who I see all across Pennsylvania, in very rural areas, and really the cyber platform is maybe the only time they have access to occupational therapy, any other service,"" Cyktor said. ""So if that gets cut, these kids are going to be losing out on these vital services and doing this really important development at such a young age.""

Cyktor works with students in kindergarten through 12th grade on fine motor skills, such as handwriting and typing, as well as executive functioning skills like daily activity scheduling. Without those skills, it will be difficult to enter the workforce, she emphasized.

""If they're cut now, the future impacts are going to be huge for them,"" she said.

(Nasdaq: COCP) announces that its broad-spectrum protease inhibitor CDI-988 will be featured in an oral presentation at the 2025 Military Health System Research Symposium (MHSRS) being held August 4-7 in Kissimmee, Fla. Cocrystal is developing CDI-988 as a norovirus prophylaxis and treatment. Sam Lee, PhD, the Company’s President and co-CEO, will discuss Phase 1 results during the Broad-Spectrum Anti-Viral Countermeasures breakout session on August 4, 2025.

“I am pleased to be discussing CDI-988 at this prestigious conference that showcases innovative antiviral agents to treat militarily relevant pathogens,” said Dr. Lee. “Norovirus is a leading cause of acute gastroenteritis worldwide for which there are no approved antiviral agents or vaccines. Norovirus spreads rapidly through confined spaces such as in ships or other military settings, and can inflict severe vomiting and diarrhea, posing a potential threat to operational effectiveness and a significant economic burden.

“Cocrystal developed CDI-988 as a potential breakthrough for norovirus prophylaxis and treatment using our proprietary structure-based platform technology. Unlike conventional antivirals, it targets the virus' core replication machinery, halting infection at early stages regardless of viral strain or mutation,” he added. “We believe CDI-988 could transform how norovirus outbreaks are prevented and treated.”

Pan-Viral Inhibitor CDI-988

CDI-988 was designed and developed as a broad-spectrum inhibitor to a highly conserved region in the active site of 3CL viral proteases. Based on a novel mechanism of action and superior broad-spectrum antiviral activity, CDI-988 represents a compelling first-in-class oral treatment for both noroviruses and coronaviruses. Cocrystal has completed a single-center, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled Phase 1 study in healthy adults evaluating the safety, tolerability and pharmacokinetics of CDI-988, including a food effect cohort.

Structure-Based Platform Technology

Cocrystal’s proprietary structural biology, along with its expertise in enzymology and medicinal chemistry, enable its development of novel antiviral agents. The Company’s platform provides a three-dimensional structure of inhibitor complexes at near-atomic resolution, providing immediate insight to guide Structure Activity Relationships. This helps to identify novel binding sites and allows for a rapid turnaround of structural information through highly automated X-ray data processing and refinement. The goal of this technology is to facilitate the development of best-in-class antiviral therapies that have fast onset of action or shortened treatment time, are safe, well tolerated and easy to administer; and are effective against all viral subtypes that cause disease and have a high barrier to viral resistance.

About Military Health System Research Symposium

MHSRS is an annual educational symposium with approximately 4,000 attendees that provides a collaborative environment for military medical care providers with deployment experience, research and academic scientists, international partners and industry on research and related healthcare initiatives falling under the topic areas of combat casualty care, military operational medicine, clinical and rehabilitative medicine, information sciences, military infectious diseases and radiation health effects.

“Cocrystal developed CDI-988 as a potential breakthrough for norovirus prophylaxis and treatment using our proprietary structure-based platform technology.
Based on a novel mechanism of action and superior broad-spectrum antiviral activity, CDI-988 represents a compelling first-in-class oral treatment for both noroviruses and coronaviruses.
We have based these forward-looking statements largely on our current expectations and projections about future events.
Some or all of the events anticipated by these forward-looking statements may not occur.","BOTHELL, Wash., June 05, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Cocrystal Pharma, Inc. (Nasdaq: COCP) announces that its broad-spectrum protease inhibitor CDI-988 will be featured in an oral presentation at the 2025 Military Health System Research Symposium (MHSRS) being held August 4-7 in Kissimmee, Fla. Cocrystal is developing CDI-988 as a norovirus prophylaxis and treatment. Sam Lee, PhD, the Company’s President and co-CEO, will discuss Phase 1 results during the Broad-Spectrum Anti-Viral Countermeasures breakout session on August 4, 2025.

“I am pleased to be discussing CDI-988 at this prestigious conference that showcases innovative antiviral agents to treat militarily relevant pathogens,” said Dr. Lee. “Norovirus is a leading cause of acute gastroenteritis worldwide for which there are no approved antiviral agents or vaccines. Norovirus spreads rapidly through confined spaces such as in ships or other military settings, and can inflict severe vomiting and diarrhea, posing a potential threat to operational effectiveness and a significant economic burden.

“Cocrystal developed CDI-988 as a potential breakthrough for norovirus prophylaxis and treatment using our proprietary structure-based platform technology. Unlike conventional antivirals, it targets the virus' core replication machinery, halting infection at early stages regardless of viral strain or mutation,” he added. “We believe CDI-988 could transform how norovirus outbreaks are prevented and treated.”

Pan-Viral Inhibitor CDI-988

CDI-988 was designed and developed as a broad-spectrum inhibitor to a highly conserved region in the active site of 3CL viral proteases. Based on a novel mechanism of action and superior broad-spectrum antiviral activity, CDI-988 represents a compelling first-in-class oral treatment for both noroviruses and coronaviruses. Cocrystal has completed a single-center, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled Phase 1 study in healthy adults evaluating the safety, tolerability and pharmacokinetics of CDI-988, including a food effect cohort.

Structure-Based Platform Technology

Cocrystal’s proprietary structural biology, along with its expertise in enzymology and medicinal chemistry, enable its development of novel antiviral agents. The Company’s platform provides a three-dimensional structure of inhibitor complexes at near-atomic resolution, providing immediate insight to guide Structure Activity Relationships. This helps to identify novel binding sites and allows for a rapid turnaround of structural information through highly automated X-ray data processing and refinement. The goal of this technology is to facilitate the development of best-in-class antiviral therapies that have fast onset of action or shortened treatment time, are safe, well tolerated and easy to administer; and are effective against all viral subtypes that cause disease and have a high barrier to viral resistance.

It sounds like you are medically retired as this amount does not make sense.

Reinstatement usually requires you to pay back owed premiums+ the current month + a minimum of 2 months ahead. So you are rounding up/down the amount I would assume.

The monthly rate that makes sense is for TRICARE Select Group A Retired Sponsor and Family which is $30.41 monthly so 4 X $30.41=$121.64.

If you are on a different plan there may be other reasons- but there may be a reason you were dis enrolled for non payment that could be as simple as an expired credit card.

The Soldier Recovery Brigade-National Capital Region (SRB-NCR), headquartered at Walter Reed, hosted the luncheon honoring the dedication of military caregivers, often family members and friends of those in recovery, most who are wounded, ill and injured service members.

During the luncheon, U.S. Army Brig. Gen. (Dr.) Lance Raney, Commanding General of Medical Readiness Command, East, addressed the attendees, noting the tireless efforts of military caregivers.

As a board-certified family medicine physician, he acknowledged that many people may not fully grasp “the pain, joy and sacrifices” experienced by military caregivers. “We respect your commitment, but to just say a blind, ‘Thank you,’ to a certain degree is a disservice and not fully appreciating what you do.”

Raney also highlighted the important advocacy role military caregivers play within the Military Health System, saying, “You hold us accountable. You push us to do what we should be doing, and for that, I can say a sincere, ‘Thank you.’ You are making health care and our processes better not just for you, but for everybody else. You live and are the Army Value that I consider the most significant – selfless service.”

U.S. Army Col. Elizabeth Cain, SRB-NCR commander, echoed these sentiments. She stressed how essential it is to recognize military caregivers for their partnership and the sacrifices they make to help service members move through their healing process, whether it’s returning to active duty or transitioning to veteran status.

“Your mutual support is another tangible example of our joint endeavor to care and work towards healing of our service members here at Walter Reed,” Cain concluded.",https://www.militaryspot.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/caregivers.png,N,1.0,2025-06-05 09:56:46.591243

The Tennessee National Guard Association played a key role in advocating for the legislation and working with lawmakers to get it passed.

Known as the “Tennessee National Guard Servicemember’s Medical Readiness Act,” the new law helps Guardsmen offset the cost of healthcare premiums under TRICARE Reserve Select and the TRICARE Dental Program.

Previously, traditional Guardsmen, those serving part-time under state or federal orders for training, were responsible for paying the full cost of their TRICARE coverage unless insured through a civilian employer. While deployed on federal active duty, they receive full medical coverage, but during regular training periods, they were responsible for purchasing their own insurance. For many, this meant covering TRICARE premiums themselves to maintain continuous coverage.

“This legislation improves access to healthcare for our Soldiers and Airmen,” said Maj. Gen. Warner Ross, Tennessee’s Adjutant General. “It will increase our overall medical readiness and ensures that our Guardsmen will have access to healthcare throughout their service, regardless of duty status.”

This program is expected to benefit nearly 2,000 servicemembers when it takes effect on July 1st. To qualify, Tennessee Guardsmen must be enrolled in TRICARE Reserve Select or the TRICARE Dental Program and must not receive comparable coverage from a civilian employer.

The Tennessee National Guard Association played a key role in advocating for the legislation and working with lawmakers to get it passed.

“Our Soldiers and Airmen make real sacrifices to serve their state and nation, and this program ensures they remain ready to answer the call when their fellow citizens need them the most,” said Lt. Col. Meredith Richardson, President of the National Guard Association of Tennessee.

This initiative reflects Tennessee’s ongoing efforts to support its National Guard members, ensuring they have access to healthcare resources while serving the state and nation.

Stars and Stripes serves the U.S. military community by providing editorially independent news and information around the world.

Inconsistencies between states could have cost U.S. taxpayers and Tricare beneficiaries millions of dollars in excessive payments for some medical procedures and devices, a watchdog report has found.

The cost of certain medical procedures and devices varied greatly from state to state, according to a Pentagon inspector general audit published May 1. That probe found Tricare — the military's Defense Health Agency-run medical insurance provider that covers some 9.5 million troops, veterans and their family members — paid out thousands of dollars more for similar procedures and medical devices in some states versus others. The report found inconsistent DHA policies governing the amount of money that Tricare pays for medical care.

[READ THE REPORT]

In one instance, the IG found Tricare was paying some $11,500 for custom sleep apnea mouthguards in Illinois that were costing it about $3,000 in neighboring Iowa. The payment discrepancy came about because Tricare, which is split into two regions in the U.S. with Illinois in its east section and Iowa in its west, uses contractors to establish a basic pay rate, known as a prevailing rate, for standard procedures and devices based on the amounts that providers in those states had charged Tricare in the past. The state's prevailing rate is then set at the 80th percentile of all those charges.

The IG found there were no efforts to ensure payment rates were more consistent from one state to another. The auditors recommended Defense Health Agency officials reevaluate their methodology and ensure payment rates are not based on fraudulent or unreasonable rates charged in the past.

""Because the DHA did not determine that the state prevailing rates were reasonable, the [Defense Department] is at risk of wasteful spending and increasing DOD beneficiaries' risk of unreasonable cost-shares for health care services and items that are paid with state prevailing rates,"" the report states.

The probe also found Tricare might have been overpaying for some more rare procedures that do not have a set reimbursement rate. In fiscal 2023, Tricare paid some $183.3 million for 184 of those ""miscellaneous procedure costs."" The IG found in some cases Tricare might have paid greatly inflated rental rates for medical equipment in that miscellaneous category.

[UPDATED MONTHLY: MOAA's TRICARE Toolkit]

In one Tricare East case, the organization paid about $5,000 per month to rent a compression device for a beneficiary when another supplier advertised renting the same device for $675 per month. Still another supplier advertised it sold a different model of a similar device for $409.50, according to the report.

The IG said despite the discrepancies, recent changes to Tricare policies have led to lowered costs for the organization since 2021.",https://insurancenewsnet.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/inn-social-default.jpg,N,-1.0,2025-06-04 22:56:48.275695

Published 5:21 pm Wednesday, June 4, 2025

Getting your Trinity Audio player ready...

By AMAC Certified Social Security Advisor Russell Gloor, Association of Mature American Citizens

Dear Rusty: I’m a retired Navy veteran who is going to be turning 65 years old this year. My question is concerning mandatory Medicare sign-up requirements. Why do I have to sign up for Medicare coverage at 65 when I can’t start collecting full Social Security benefits until I turn 67? My Social Security benefits will not pay for my mandatory Medicare because I can’t start collecting full Social Security benefits until I’m 67!

I currently pay for TriCare and utilize my local Veterans Administration medical facilities and referrals for my healthcare. With me turning 65 and having to wait until I’m 67 for my full Social Security benefits, it just seems unfair that I’ll have to pay out of pocket Medicare monthly expenses for two years! Is there any way to avoid this unfair penalty? Signed: Retired Navy Vet

Dear Retired Navy Vet: First, I want to thank you for your military service to our country. Please know that here at the AMAC Foundation we care a lot about our veterans, and you may find the “For Veterans” section of our Foundation website interesting (amacfoundation.org).

Regarding your question, you should be aware that enrolling in Medicare is not mandatory, but there are consequences if you do not enroll when you become eligible (normally at age 65). For one thing, if you are a retired veteran on military TriCare, you will lose your TriCare benefits if you don’t enroll in Medicare when you are eligible (TriCare requires that you enroll in Medicare when eligible). And, since you are not yet collecting Social Security, you will be required to separately pay the Medicare Part B premium directly to Medicare (they will bill you when you enroll in Medicare). Another potential consequence is that if you do not enroll in Medicare Part B when you are first eligible, you may incur a lifetime late enrollment penalty for enrolling in Part B later.

Something else to keep in mind is that there are two “parts” to Medicare – Part A (which is coverage for inpatient hospitalization services), and Part B, which is coverage for outpatient healthcare services (doctors, medical tests, etc.). Medicare Part A is free to you, but there is a premium for Medicare Part B ($185/month for 2025). Note that you will need to pay a Part B premium as long as you are enrolled in Medicare Part B (it doesn’t go away after you are collecting Social Security, but it is taken from your Social Security payment). And there is no way for you to avoid the Part B premium after enrolling, and enrolling in Part B is necessary for you to continue your military TriCare-for-life benefits. Note that Medicare Part A and Part B do not include prescription drug coverage, but your TriCare coverage usually does.

It’s important to note that Medicare and Social Security are two independent senior programs with different eligibility rules. As you may know, you can collect early (reduced) Social Security at age 65 (and have your Medicare Part B premium deducted from your Social Security payment). But you would be collecting Social Security early and, in addition to a reduced benefit, you would also be subject to Social Security’s annual earnings test if you are still working. The Social Security earnings test limits how much you can earn before some of your SS benefits are taken away (if you exceed the earning limit prior to your full retirement age).

So, is it unfair that you must pay for Medicare Part B before you are collecting Social Security? Well, I think not, because the two programs are completely independent benefits (the Social Security Administration merely administers Medicare payments as a convenience). Remember your Medicare Part A is free, but you must pay a premium for Part B, and you must take both to retain your military TriCare-for-Life benefits. You can visit this site to see how to pay your Medicare premiums until it is later deducted from your Social Security payment: medicare.gov/basics/costs/pay-premiums/online-bill-pay.

Once again, thank you for your service to our country.

Using principles of ABA, children and adults can learn to improve their communication skills, social skills, and daily living skills while also addressing problematic or challenging behaviors. The primary goal of ABA therapy is to teach helpful skills that promote independence and reduce harmful behaviors. Here's our complete guide to everything you need to know about ABA therapy.

It's a big decision to make for your family! Applied behavior analysis (ABA) seeks to improve communication skills, introduce productive habits, and reduce harmful behaviors. Watch out for ABA providers who look to ""cure"" autism.

High quality ABA therapy does exist where the goal is not to “fix” children, make them appear “less autistic”, or change who they are. The goal is to help people learn all that they can so they can live to their potential while embracing their unique, individual personality traits. Here's our complete guide to start and end ABA therapy.

ABA looks different from other therapy settings. Typically, ABA therapy occurs multiple times a week and can take place in the home, community, or in a clinic setting. Depending on your child's needs, you might need to commit up to 40 hours a week.

ABA therapy can last for a few months to a few years. During that time, children and their families are committed to training and learning together. Therapy ideally ends when children meet their goals. Check out our complete guide for how to start and end ABA therapy.

ABA is usually covered by insurance if you have an autism diagnosis. Autism is typically the only diagnosis insurance will authorize for ABA services since its benefits have been researched extensively.

Always check with your specific insurance plan to confirm that ABA is covered for your child’s diagnoses and that the provider you are seeking care at is in-network.

The EO directed agencies to end grant funding for institutions that provide gender-affirming care for individuals under 19 and take steps to end coverage for gender-affirming care rendered to individuals under 19 under TRICARE and the Federal Employee Health Benefits program, among other directives.
The May 28, 2025 letter comes weeks after the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) issued a 409-page report sharply criticizing the gender-affirming care practices that have been widely adopted and accepted by medical societies and health care systems throughout much of the world.

The letter also requests financial information related to pediatric gender-affirming care paid for “in whole or in part” by the federal government.

The Trump Administration’s focus on the treatment of gender dysphoria for children began shortly after the President’s inauguration. Executive Order 14187, “Protecting Children From Chemical and Surgical Mutilation,” was released on January 28, 2025 and defined “children” to include individuals under 19 years of age. The EO directed agencies to end grant funding for institutions that provide gender-affirming care for individuals under 19 and take steps to end coverage for gender-affirming care rendered to individuals under 19 under TRICARE and the Federal Employee Health Benefits program, among other directives. The funding provision of the EO has since been enjoined nationwide by the U.S. District Court for the District of Maryland, which is on appeal before the Fourth Circuit. See PFLAG, Inc. v. Trump, No. CV 25-337-BAH, 2025 WL 685124 (D. Md. Mar. 4, 2025).

The May 28, 2025 letter comes weeks after the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) issued a 409-page report sharply criticizing the gender-affirming care practices that have been widely adopted and accepted by medical societies and health care systems throughout much of the world. Citing the report, the May 28 letter to hospitals states CMS’s concerns with medical interventions related to gender-affirming care in children and requests that hospitals provide CMS within 30 days with their policies and procedures related to:

Informed consent protocols for children with gender dysphoria;

Changes to clinical practice guidelines and protocols the hospital plans to enact considering the report published by HHS; and

Any adverse events related to gender-affirming care procedures, particularly for those who may wish to “detransition” at a later date.

The letter also requests financial data related to pediatric gender-affirming care (which the letter refers to as “sex trait modification,” consistent with the proposed rules issued by the Trump Administration in March that would prohibit coverage of gender-affirming care by Affordable Care Act plans) procedures performed at the institution and paid, in whole or in part, by the federal government, including:

All billing codes used for “pediatric sex trat modifications (and that correspond with pediatric sex trait modification procedures not determined to be medically necessary)”;

Facility- and provider-level revenue or utilization data generated directly or indirectly from these procedures since 2020;

Facility- and provider-level operating and profit margins for each procedure type, including for directly or indirectly owned or affiliated providers; and

Projected revenue forecasts for these service lines.

On the same day the CMS letter was sent requesting information from hospitals, HHS Secretary Robert F. Kennedy, Jr. sent a letter to health care providers, risk managers, and state medical boards urging them to read the HHS report and stating that the agency “expects” them to promptly update treatment protocols and training to conform with the report. Despite the stated expectation, to date, HHS has not issued any new rules or requirements to mandate updates to providers’ policies and procedures.

My first volley at a claim was denied due to ""the provider not being authorized in the Tricare program"" and ""the provider may bill you for the lesser of their charges or 115% of the Tricare maximum allowable charges"".

My impression from the Tricare website and from numerous conversations with Tricare agents is that claims for non-participating providers can be approved as long as the treatment codes line up with what Tricare covers (this therapist was sure to include that on the bill) even if the provider is not certified with Tricare. As far as the maximum allowable charge for the procedure, from the minimal amount of info I was able to find on the website, it seems that Tricare's max is far below what this provider charged. So, my question there is whether my deductible would kick in at some point if I just paid the excess above the MAC.

Basically, is it worth appealing this or will my appeal (if approved) have me reimbursed pennies on the dollar since this provider is ""non-participating""? My partner has her own insurance, which we will try if Tricare is not worth the effort, although we will pay more to hit the deductible. Thank you!",,N,-1.0,2025-06-04 17:56:25.564279

It's a big decision to make for your family! Applied behavior analysis (ABA) seeks to improve communication skills, introduce productive habits, and reduce harmful behaviors. Watch out for ABA providers who look to ""cure"" autism.

High quality ABA therapy does exist where the goal is not to “fix” children, make them appear “less autistic”, or change who they are. The goal is to help people learn all that they can so they can live to their potential while embracing their unique, individual personality traits. Here's our complete guide to start and end ABA therapy.

ABA looks different from other therapy settings. Typically, ABA therapy occurs multiple times a week and can take place in the home, community, or in a clinic setting. Depending on your child's needs, you might need to commit up to 40 hours a week.

ABA therapy can last for a few months to a few years. During that time, children and their families are committed to training and learning together. Therapy ideally ends when children meet their goals. Check out our complete guide for how to start and end ABA therapy.

ABA is usually covered by insurance if you have an autism diagnosis. Autism is typically the only diagnosis insurance will authorize for ABA services since its benefits have been researched extensively.

Always check with your specific insurance plan to confirm that ABA is covered for your child’s diagnoses and that the provider you are seeking care at is in-network.

Depending on your plan, you’ll learn: Steps you need to take if you’re moving within the same TRICARE region or to a different TRICARE region, or if you’re moving to or from the U.S.
Go to Moving and click on the TRICARE plan you had in your old location to learn what to do.
Are you no longer eligible for the TRICARE health plan you had before you moved?
If you have a different TRICARE plan, you can use the Find a Doctor Tool to search for a new provider.","JUNE 4, 2025 – Are you preparing to move to a new location? Now is the best time to make sure your TRICARE benefits are ready to move with you.

“You can use TRICARE wherever you live, but there are actions you can take to help avoid interruptions to your health care and TRICARE benefits,” said Dr. Danita Hunter, chief, TRICARE Health Plan Policy & Programs Branch, at the Defense Health Agency. “Before you move, learn about what these actions are and how your health plan options may change.”

Here’s a TRICARE checklist to help you prepare for your move and what you may need to do after you get to your new location.

Before you move

FIRST: Check out TRICARE’s Moving page.

TRICARE’s Moving page has general information about what do before and after you move. The page also has summaries of what you need to do based on which health plan you’re enrolled in before you move. Depending on your plan, you’ll learn:

Steps you need to take if you’re moving within the same TRICARE region or to a different TRICARE region, or if you’re moving to or from the U.S.

If you’re able to transfer your TRICARE Prime enrollment before you move

No matter which health plan you have, keep these things in mind:

Don’t disenroll from any plan before you move. You’re covered by your current plan on your way to your new location.

Update your address and other contact information in the Defense Enrollment Eligibility Reporting System after you move.

SECOND: Learn how your health plan options might change.

The TRICARE health plans you qualify for may change when you move. For example, your eligibility for TRICARE Prime can change based on who you are and where you move to.

You can use the Plan Finder to see which plans you may qualify for in your new location. Not sure which plan is right for you? You can use the Compare Plans Tool to compare the features of different plans side by side.

Moving is sometimes a TRICARE Qualifying Life Event. Relocation must be to a new country, city, region, or ZIP+4 code to be a QLE. You have 90 days from the date of your address change in DEERS to change your health plan.

THIRD: Get health services and request copies of your health records.

Before you move, catch up on getting your routine care and specialty care, if needed. Be sure to discuss any ongoing health issues and prescriptions with your current primary care manager, primary care provider, or specialist.

Do you have any active referrals? These referrals will still be valid in your new location. (Note: This doesn’t apply if you have an active referral you received with the current referral approval waiver in the West Region.)

Before you move, call the regional contractor for your current location to request your referrals be transferred to the regional contractor for your new location. Your referrals won’t be transferred unless you or your provider requests this. Once you set up your enrollment with your new regional contractor, you can ask the contractor to help you find a provider. The contractor may also be able to help make your first appointment with a new specialist.

If you see any civilian medical or dental providers, be sure to ask for copies of your records to take with you. Talk to your TRICARE contractor for more information on requesting and transferring records.

Are you a service member under permanent change of station orders? Ensure you out-process at your military hospital or clinic. You can also request to transfer your family members’ health records to the military hospital or clinic at your new duty station.

FOURTH: Fill prescriptions.

Make sure you have enough of your medication to last during and immediately after your move. Learn more about filling prescriptions.

After you move

FIRST: Update your contact information.

After you move, update your address and contact information in DEERS as soon as possible. Up-to-date DEERS records are vital to accessing your TRICARE benefits. Incorrect addresses can cause issues with eligibility, claims, billing, authorization letters for referrals, and filling prescriptions. Learn how to update your DEERS record.

For many TRICARE plans, you should also update your contact information with the regional contractor for your new location. (If you pay enrollment fees or premiums, it is also a good time to check with your regional contractor to see if you need to make any updates to your payment method.) Go to Moving and click on the TRICARE plan you had in your old location to learn what to do. You don’t need to do this if you have TRICARE For Life, as described in the TRICARE For Life Handbook.

Are you enrolled in the TRICARE Dental Program? You should call the TDP contractor, United Concordia, to update your contact information.

SECOND: Change your health plan within 90 days.

Are you no longer eligible for the TRICARE health plan you had before you moved? If so, you must enroll in a new health plan within 90 days of updating your address in DEERS. If you don’t, you’ll only be eligible for care and pharmacy services at a military hospital or clinic, if space is available. After 90 days, you can only enroll in a plan after another TRICARE QLE or during TRICARE Open Season.

THIRD: Choose a new primary care manager or find a provider.

If you have a TRICARE Prime plan, you may need to choose a new primary care manager.

If you have a different TRICARE plan, you can use the Find a Doctor Tool to search for a new provider. If you’re looking for providers in the U.S., be sure to enter the ZIP code for your new location to make sure you get to the right provider directory.

FOURTH: Update your TRICARE Pharmacy Home Delivery mailing address.

Do you get prescriptions through TRICARE Pharmacy Home Delivery? Be sure to update your mailing address with the TRICARE Pharmacy Program contractor, Express Scripts. Keep in mind that there are different rules for using home delivery outside the U.S. and U.S. territories.

The law of the land encourages taxpayer-funded health insurance programs like Medicare, VA, and TRICARE to reduce competition and drive up prices.
I feel like a pawn in a backwards health care system, one that incentivizes using health care for the military and their families as a money maker.","Medical billing is shrouded in mystery, and the final dollar amounts often come as a surprise at the least opportune time.

A few years ago, while my Marine husband was deployed overseas, I broke my thumb and needed to visit the emergency room for treatment. I went to a large, nearby hospital off-base where I received medical attention and was sent home.

I’m sure the billing department had cartoon-like dollar signs for eyes when they saw my insurance information. I was covered by TRICARE, the military’s insurance provider.

Government-provided health insurance providers — think TRICARE, VA health coverage, or Medicare — operate differently, but not when it comes to reimbursement rates. Providers can bill VA and TRICARE at Medicare rates, and Medicare pays a lot more when care is provided in a hospital setting.

Treating me meant the hospital could bill my insurance provider at a much higher rate than the care actually costs. Had it been delivered elsewhere, by an independent provider, it would have been cheaper. Hospitals bill at the higher rate because the law allows them to. The bill was bigger, not because of the quality of the care, but because of where I went to get it.

This disparity incentivizes hospitals to become monopolies, because when independent physician practices and outpatient facilities merge with a larger hospital system, the system can charge more, despite there being no improvement in convenience or quality.

Medicare pays out 106%-217% more to these facilities and large systems than it does to the smaller, privately owned facilities. Hospitals use Medicare rates for billing care for service members and their families who have Tricare, as well as veterans who are covered under the VA for their health insurance.

Under both systems, hospitals are essentially allowed to rip the government off when veterans and their families utilize the community care (care outside of a military or VA facility) they’re entitled to.

So large hospital systems buy up their competition, reclassify the newly acquired facilities as hospital-based settings, and then raise their prices with impunity, because there is no competition or incentive to drive costs down. The share of practices owned by hospitals more than doubled between 2013 and 2018, and by 2020, more than half of all physicians worked either directly for a hospital or in a hospital-owned practice.

These facilities give you the exact same services, but at a much higher cost.

This is why people think the medical industry is dishonest. But it’s just working within the loopholes and special circumstances the government has created.

The law of the land encourages taxpayer-funded health insurance programs like Medicare, VA, and TRICARE to reduce competition and drive up prices. That equals fewer options with high out-of-pocket costs for patients.

Luckily, there is a commonsense solution that can fix this issue - site neutrality.

The principle behind site-neutrality is simple: “same service, same price,” regardless of where you get the care. This would unleash competition and drive down costs for seniors, veterans, and service members, and save taxpayers money, too. Those are wins for everyone.

Naturally, the powerful hospital lobby is opposed to such a concept. But site neutrality is widely popular and bipartisan as it increases access and lowers costs — two things Americans are hungry for in their health care.

Senator John Kennedy of Louisiana recently introduced the Same Care, Lower Cost Act (S-1629) to end this unfair billing practice. If enacted, the bill would save taxpayers $157 billionover its first 10 years.

And over in the House, Representative Rich McCormick of Georgia, a veteran and former emergency room physician, is seeking to break the logjam with a pair of new bills would specifically address the situation I found myself in: the Servicemember Site-Neutrality Act(HR-873) and the Veterans Site-Neutrality Act (HR-874), which would institute site-neutral payments in TRICARE and the VA, respectively.

If enacted, medical care for veterans and service members will be billed at a lower rate for the same care they’re getting today, with the same quality, and with more options to choose from. They would also save the VA and the DoD health care programs taxpayer dollars, making it easier to fully fund desperately needed options like the VA Community Care Program created by the historic VA MISSION Act.

As a military spouse, it especially bothers me that my care and that of military families and veterans cost more for no good reason. I feel like a pawn in a backwards health care system, one that incentivizes using health care for the military and their families as a money maker.

That’s why I’m so glad to see site-neutral legislation targeted at care for the military community. We’re not looking for handouts, “perks,” or anything dishonest or unfair.

Veterans and service members earned their care. They should have access to it at the highest quality and convenience — at competitive, affordable prices. Site-neutrality is the answer.",https://assets.realclear.com/images/64/646336_6_.jpg,N,-1.0,2025-06-04 12:56:45.448289

Some other common things speech therapists can help with:

Nonverbal skills, such as signs or gestures

Forming speech in a clearer way

Communicating thoughts and feelings clearly

Understanding and responding to questions

Discerning facial expressions and their corresponding emotions

Noticing and understanding body language

Feeding and swallowing

Stuttering

Speech therapy is almost always recommended for autistic children since many people with autism have difficulty with social communication. Even if a child is very verbal and says a lot of words, they might need to work on communication skills like:

responding to questions

starting or ending conversation

changing conversation topics

using gestures like pointing

understanding other people's body language

Speech therapy is a big focus in early intervention for autistic children and is usually the starting place for recently diagnosed kids. There is a critical period in the brain for language development and so, it's really important to teach language and communication skills as early as possible, especially if there are any delays in that area.

But the MHS is unlike any health care system in the United States – we go to war.
From keeping service members healthy here at home to mitigating disease overseas, we keep guns in the fight.
Medically ready forces keep guns in the fight and ready medical forces honor the pact that America makes to its sons and daughters to provide world-class medical care anytime, anywhere, under any conditions.
The MHS is one of the best healthcare systems in America and the very best military medical system in the world.","FALLS CHURCH, Virginia – One of George Washington’s many wise aphorisms, “To be prepared for war is one of the most effective means of preserving peace,” is timeless. Teddy Roosevelt updated the maxim for audiences of his time, advising the country to, “Speak softly and carry a big stick.” Today we press for Peace through Strength.

The Military Health System (MHS) is a key element in executing this strategy. With a global network of 700+ hospitals and clinics and more than 130,000 military and civilian healthcare professionals standing the watch, the MHS ensures America possesses a medically ready force that is fit to fight at a moment’s notice. The MHS sees optimizing the human factor as our strategic edge in combat. But the MHS is unlike any health care system in the United States – we go to war.

From keeping service members healthy here at home to mitigating disease overseas, we keep guns in the fight. By bringing operating rooms and ICUs to the front lines, aboard ships, and in the sky, we empower warfighters to take heroic risks, confident that the world’s best doctors, nurses, and medics have their back at each step and upon every acre on earth. There is nothing the MHS won’t do: no research too ambitious, no device too expensive, no distance too far to preserve or restore the health of our warfighters.

As Acting Assistant Secretary of Defense for Health Affairs, I’m proud to be charged with guaranteeing our medical forces provide world-class medical care and deploy rapidly to support any and all American military missions. The responsibility doesn’t end there. The MHS also ensures those who protect hearth and home -family members - also receive world-class medical care. This empowers deployed Service members to remain mission-focused without having to worry about the health of their spouse or child.

We also fulfill the solemn compact to provide health care to those retirees who devoted their life’s work and innumerable sacrifices in the service of this Nation. As a retired Navy physician and a military spouse, I understand the sacrifices Service members and their families make, both what it’s like to deploy and what it’s like to be left behind. This mission is both intensely personal and intensely rewarding.

That’s why the current underperformance of the new TRICARE contract is especially frustrating to me. The TRICARE health plan is a key pillar of the military’s healthcare delivery system. Millions of family members and retirees rely on TRICARE’s network of providers and hospitals for both medical care and mental health services, like autism care that families count on each and every day. The Defense Health Agency

and I are working tirelessly to hold the contractors accountable, to grant waivers to ensure access to specialty care, and to help families navigate this transition. We’re making progress, but not quickly enough. I will continue to work on behalf of military families until this system is fixed, and to ensure this doesn’t happen again.

The garrison mission of the MHS is carried out in military medical treatment facilities across the globe. The mission is best distilled to its essence: readiness. Medical readiness is combat readiness, and while we’re grateful to have the current moment of relative peace, we must remain vigilant. When the enemy strikes, we need our Service members physically fit, mentally aware, and healthy to defend our nation.

Throughout history, interwar periods have had a pernicious effect on medical readiness, so much so that these periods bear the eponym: The Walker Dip. In 2018, Surgeon General of the British Armed Forces Vice Admiral Alasdair Walker described a recurring and troubling pattern dating back to the 19th century. From the Napoleonic War (1803-1815) to Iraq and Afghanistan, hard-earned lessons and experience gained in combat, such as the importance of specialized trauma care and transfusion medicine, are forgotten and must be relearned. Sadly, these skills “dips” diminish survival rates, resulting in greater injury and loss of life. Forewarned is forearmed. It’s my personal mission to ensure that the skills and expertise leading to the historically high battlefield survival rates that we achieved in Iraq and Afghanistan are never forgotten.

In a world of profound geopolitical risk and competing economic priorities, how can military medicine avoid the Walker Dip? How can it successfully compete for resources with modernization and replenishment of our weapons stock? Simply put, we can’t afford not to.

Fortunately, military medicine isn’t in competition with warfighting priorities such as weapons systems. Rather, it potentiates the ultimate weapons system: the American Soldier, Sailor, Airman, Marine, and Guardian. Medically ready forces keep guns in the fight and ready medical forces honor the pact that America makes to its sons and daughters to provide world-class medical care anytime, anywhere, under any conditions.

The strategy to maintain peak readiness, to cheat the Walker Dip, is three pronged: Support, Sustain, and Strengthen.

We Support our warfighters in battle. This is our raison d’etre.

We Sustain our skills by doing high volume, high complexity medical care.

We Strengthen our chain by fortifying our force generation platforms.

These goals are mutually reinforcing, fostering a virtuous cycle of success. These priorities require resources, leadership, and commitment. I have infinite confidence in the commitment, skill, and dedication of our people. The MHS is one of the best healthcare systems in America and the very best military medical system in the world. We are blessed with outstanding and supportive leaders in the Department who I will continue to work with to ensure the MHS has what it needs. I will continue to tell our story to our elected representatives on Capitol Hill and advocate for our warfighters to ensure they have the medical support they deserve.

Military medicine is a no-fail mission. I’m confident that our success will continue to reinforce the strength that sustains the peace. But should the peace be broken… our preparation will ensure we break the Walker Dip streak.",https://api.army.mil/e2/c/images/2025/06/03/01fa6cc5/max1200.jpg,N,1.0,2025-06-03 19:56:18.013499

""I've been on aeromedical evacuation missions where time is vital,"" said U.S. Air Force Capt.
Joint Base Charleston remains dedicated to building its readiness for missions around the world and strengthening its role as a premier power projection platform.","JOINT BASE CHARLESTON, S.C. – A new Consolidated Storage and Distribution Center warehouse is now fully operational at Joint Base Charleston, May 30, 2025.

This facility marks a significant improvement to the base’s medical logistics infrastructure.

The Defense Health Agency partnered with the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers and Naval Facilities Engineering Systems Command to construct the $21.8 million dollar facility, demonstrating the joint-service priority placed on medical logistics modernization.

The new 95,000-square-foot warehouse brings all medical supply functions on-base for the first time. Originally supplies were kept at a difficult to access off-base location with limited space, increasing the chances of security threats and posing logistics challenges.

""This warehouse allows us to respond in hours instead of days,"" said U.S. Air Force Master Sgt. Jacleen Blevins, Charleston CSDC section chief. ""We can respond to everything from a Covid mission to deploying medical teams with supplies immediately accessible on-base.""

Medical logistics personnel can now access critical supplies immediately rather than coordinating off-base transportation, which often caused delays during mission-critical situations.

“Having a state of the art facility on base with our operational assets co-located is a game changer,” said U.S. Air Force Tech Sgt. Timothy Villa, Charleston CSDC medical logistics noncommissioned officer in charge. “We’ve never been better positioned to carry out the Air Force mission anytime, anywhere.”

Joint Base Charleston's C-17 Globemaster III aircraft have the capability to serve as flying hospitals, making this new facility critical to their mission. These large aircraft can transport medical equipment worldwide, but only when supplies are immediately available for deployment.

""I've been on aeromedical evacuation missions where time is vital,"" said U.S. Air Force Capt. Michael Gonzalez, 15th Airlift Squadron C-17 Globemaster III pilot. ""One time we sat on the ground for hours for medication to come in from off-base; all the while, a severely injured soldier was in Iraq, struggling for his life. These are not just glitches in time and logistics, they are life-threatening situations. When the C-17 is fully mission capable as a flying hospital and ready to go, it needs to get airborne in the shortest time possible. Anything longer than that is life threatening.""

Joint Base Charleston remains dedicated to building its readiness for missions around the world and strengthening its role as a premier power projection platform. This new warehouse is designed to play a large role in making that happen today and into the future.",https://d1ldvf68ux039x.cloudfront.net/thumbs/photos/2506/9081414/1000w_q95.jpg,N,0.0,2025-06-03 17:56:27.056249

Depending on your plan, you’ll learn: Steps you need to take if you’re moving within the same TRICARE region or to a different TRICARE region, or if you’re moving to or from the U.S.
Go to Moving and click on the TRICARE plan you had in your old location to learn what to do.
Are you no longer eligible for the TRICARE health plan you had before you moved?
If you have a different TRICARE plan, you can use the Find a Doctor Tool to search for a new provider.","Are you preparing to move to a new location? Now is the best time to make sure your TRICARE benefits are ready to move with you.

“You can use TRICARE wherever you live, but there are actions you can take to help avoid interruptions to your health care and TRICARE benefits,” said Dr. Danita Hunter, chief, TRICARE Health Plan Policy & Programs Branch, at the Defense Health Agency. “Before you move, learn about what these actions are and how your health plan options may change.”

Here’s a TRICARE checklist to help you prepare for your move and what you may need to do after you get to your new location.

Before you move

1. Check out TRICARE’s Moving page.

TRICARE’s Moving page has general information about what do before and after you move. The page also has summaries of what you need to do based on which health plan you’re enrolled in before you move. Depending on your plan, you’ll learn:

Steps you need to take if you’re moving within the same TRICARE region or to a different TRICARE region, or if you’re moving to or from the U.S.

If you’re able to transfer your TRICARE Prime enrollment before you move

No matter which health plan you have, keep these things in mind:

Don’t disenroll from any plan before you move. You’re covered by your current plan on your way to your new location.

Update your address and other contact information in the Defense Enrollment Eligibility Reporting System after you move.

2. Learn how your health plan options might change.

The TRICARE health plans you qualify for may change when you move. For example, your eligibility for TRICARE Prime can change based on who you are and where you move to.

You can use the Plan Finder to see which plans you may qualify for in your new location. Not sure which plan is right for you? You can use the Compare Plans Tool to compare the features of different plans side by side.

Moving is sometimes a TRICARE Qualifying Life Event. Relocation must be to a new country, city, region, or ZIP+4 code to be a QLE. You have 90 days from the date of your address change in DEERS to change your health plan.

3. Get health services and request copies of your health records.

Before you move, catch up on getting your routine care and specialty care, if needed. Be sure to discuss any ongoing health issues and prescriptions with your current primary care manager, primary care provider, or specialist.

Do you have any active referrals? These referrals will still be valid in your new location. (Note: This doesn’t apply if you have an active referral you received with the current referral approval waiver in the West Region.)

Before you move, call the regional contractor for your current location to request your referrals be transferred to the regional contractor for your new location. Your referrals won’t be transferred unless you or your provider requests this. Once you set up your enrollment with your new regional contractor, you can ask the contractor to help you find a provider. The contractor may also be able to help make your first appointment with a new specialist.

If you see any civilian medical or dental providers, be sure to ask for copies of your records to take with you. Talk to your TRICARE contractor for more information on requesting and transferring records.

Are you a service member under permanent change of station orders? Ensure you out-process at your military hospital or clinic. You can also request to transfer your family members’ health records to the military hospital or clinic at your new duty station.

4. Fill prescriptions.

Make sure you have enough of your medication to last during and immediately after your move. Learn more about filling prescriptions.

After you move

1. Update your contact information.

After you move, update your address and contact information in DEERS as soon as possible. Up-to-date DEERS records are vital to accessing your TRICARE benefits. Incorrect addresses can cause issues with eligibility, claims, billing, authorization letters for referrals, and filling prescriptions. Learn how to update your DEERS record.

For many TRICARE plans, you should also update your contact information with the regional contractor for your new location. (If you pay enrollment fees or premiums, it is also a good time to check with your regional contractor to see if you need to make any updates to your payment method.) Go to Moving and click on the TRICARE plan you had in your old location to learn what to do. You don’t need to do this if you have TRICARE For Life, as described in the TRICARE For Life Handbook.

Are you enrolled in the TRICARE Dental Program? You should call the TDP contractor, United Concordia, to update your contact information.

2. Change your health plan within 90 days.

Are you no longer eligible for the TRICARE health plan you had before you moved? If so, you must enroll in a new health plan within 90 days of updating your address in DEERS. If you don’t, you’ll only be eligible for care and pharmacy services at a military hospital or clinic, if space is available. After 90 days, you can only enroll in a plan after another TRICARE QLE or during TRICARE Open Season.

3. Choose a new primary care manager or find a provider.

If you have a TRICARE Prime plan, you may need to choose a new primary care manager.

If you have a different TRICARE plan, you can use the Find a Doctor Tool to search for a new provider. If you’re looking for providers in the U.S., be sure to enter the ZIP code for your new location to make sure you get to the right provider directory.

4. Update your TRICARE Pharmacy Home Delivery mailing address.

Do you get prescriptions through TRICARE Pharmacy Home Delivery? Be sure to update your mailing address with the TRICARE Pharmacy Program contractor, Express Scripts. Keep in mind that there are different rules for using home delivery outside the U.S. and U.S. territories.",https://media.defense.gov/2025/Jun/03/2003731665/1920/1080/0/250603-O-D0202-1001.PNG,N,0.0,2025-06-03 17:56:44.906116

But the MHS is unlike any health care system in the United States - we go to war.

Medically ready forces keep guns in the fight and ready medical forces honor the pact that America makes to its sons and daughters to provide world-class medical care anytime, anywhere, under any conditions.
The MHS is one of the best healthcare systems in America and the very best military medical system in the world.","One of George Washington’s many wise aphorisms, “To be prepared for war is one of the most effective means of preserving peace,” is timeless. Teddy Roosevelt updated the maxim for audiences of his time, advising the country to, “Speak softly and carry a big stick.” Today we press for Peace through Strength.

The Military Health System (MHS) is a key element in executing this strategy. With a global network of 700+ hospitals and clinics and more than 130,000 military and civilian healthcare professionals standing the watch, the MHS ensures America possesses a medically ready force that is fit to fight at a moment’s notice. The MHS sees optimizing the human factor as our strategic edge in combat. But the MHS is unlike any health care system in the United States - we go to war.

From keeping service members healthy here at home to mitigating disease overseas, we keep guns in the fight. By bringing operating rooms and ICUs to the front lines, aboard ships, and in the sky, we empower warfighters to take heroic risks, confident that the world’s best doctors, nurses, and medics have their back at each step and upon every acre on earth. There is nothing the MHS won’t do: no research too ambitious, no device too expensive, no distance too far to preserve or restore the health of our warfighters.

As Acting Assistant Secretary of Defense for Health Affairs, I’m proud to be charged with guaranteeing our medical forces provide world-class medical care and deploy rapidly to support any and all American military missions. The responsibility doesn’t end there. The MHS also ensures those who protect hearth and home - family members - also receive world-class medical care. This empowers deployed Service members to remain mission-focused without having to worry about the health of their spouse or child.

We also fulfill the solemn compact to provide health care to those retirees who devoted their life’s work and innumerable sacrifices in the service of this Nation. As a retired Navy physician and a military spouse, I understand the sacrifices Service members and their families make, both what it’s like to deploy and what it’s like to be left behind. This mission is both intensely personal and intensely rewarding.

That’s why the current underperformance of the new TRICARE contract is especially frustrating to me. The TRICARE health plan is a key pillar of the military’s healthcare delivery system. Millions of family members and retirees rely on TRICARE’s network of providers and hospitals for both medical care and mental health services, like autism care that families count on each and every day. The Defense Health Agency and I are working tirelessly to hold the contractors accountable, to grant waivers to ensure access to specialty care, and to help families navigate this transition. We’re making progress, but not quickly enough. I will continue to work on behalf of military families until this system is fixed, and to ensure this doesn’t happen again.

The garrison mission of the MHS is carried out in military medical treatment facilities across the globe. The mission is best distilled to its essence: readiness. Medical readiness is combat readiness, and while we’re grateful to have the current moment of relative peace, we must remain vigilant. When the enemy strikes, we need our Service members physically fit, mentally aware, and healthy to defend our nation.

Throughout history, interwar periods have had a pernicious effect on medical readiness, so much so that these periods bear the eponym: The Walker Dip.

,,2025-06-03 16:52:39+00:00,DHA.mil - The Official Website of The Defense Health Agency,"Ferrara: 'Smarter, Integrated, and Data-Driven Health Care' an Operational Imperative - DHA.mil",Not Available,,,,,https://dha.mil/News/2025/06/03/15/19/Military-Health-System-Leader-Smarter-Integrated-and-Data-Driven-Health-Care,"Interoperability is one of the biggest challenges facing service members and veterans in their lifelong health care experience, Dr. Stephen Ferrara, Acting Assistant Secretary of Defense for Health Affairs, said recently to a group of military and veteran healthcare leaders.
To address this, he said the Department of Defense’s ongoing collaboration with Department of Veterans Affairs, Department of Health and Human Services, and other federal partners remains vital to improving continuity of care for service members.
“We are all focused on a mission that cuts across every sector represented: Delivering smarter, integrated, and data-driven health care for service members, veterans, and their families,” he said.
“This is more than a technical conversation—it’s an operational imperative,” he continued.
“This is the backbone of a connected system that allows service members’ medical history to follow them from basic training to the battlefield and ultimately into the VA EHR system,” Ferrara said.","Interoperability is one of the biggest challenges facing service members and veterans in their lifelong health care experience, Dr. Stephen Ferrara, Acting Assistant Secretary of Defense for Health Affairs, said recently to a group of military and veteran healthcare leaders.

To address this, he said the Department of Defense’s ongoing collaboration with Department of Veterans Affairs, Department of Health and Human Services, and other federal partners remains vital to improving continuity of care for service members. “We are all focused on a mission that cuts across every sector represented: Delivering smarter, integrated, and data-driven health care for service members, veterans, and their families,” he said.

“This is more than a technical conversation—it’s an operational imperative,” he continued. “The nature of warfare is changing. So is the nature of care. From polytrauma and blast injuries to long-term behavioral health challenges and environmental exposure risks, the people we serve need a healthcare system that is resilient, proactive, and agile enough to adapt in real time.”

Addressing the complexities of the MHS, Ferrara stressed, “Our purpose remains constant: To deliver world-class, operationally relevant, and future-ready health care—not just in hospitals and clinics, but on ships, in operational medical units across combat zones, and increasingly in the digital space.”

He talked about the urgency of having “a single, secure electronic health record across all military treatment facilities—one that spans operational, deployed, and garrison environments.”

In 2024, DOD completed a seven-year, multi-billion dollar project to deploy MHS GENESIS at all military hospitals and clinics as the DOD’s single electronic health record. “This is the backbone of a connected system that allows service members’ medical history to follow them from basic training to the battlefield and ultimately into the VA EHR system,” Ferrara said.

MHS GENESIS will ultimately provide a seamless healthcare experience for service members moving from the MHS to the VA by providing “access to their complete clinical history, from battlefield treatment notes to neuroimaging records, and mental health encounters.”

“That is not just a matter of convenience; it is the difference between proactive, effective care and fragmented follow-up. It is also how we ensure that we are supporting the warfighter beyond the battlefield, providing continuity of care that spans service and system boundaries,” said Ferrara.

Ferrara noted three areas of focus to modernize the EHR experience:

Artificial intelligence-powered decision support tools to identify early signs of posttraumatic stress disorder, traumatic brain injuries, and suicide risk

Remote monitoring systems for chronic disease and post-operative care

Expanded virtual health capabilities that allow surgical consultations from deployed hospital units and behavioral health visits from remote duty stations

He said with these capabilities, it would allow the MHS to “deliver care in what is being called the ‘fourth space’ of health care—beyond hospitals, clinics, and home. In this new digital space, information moves faster than geography, connecting care teams and patients across domains, countries, and conflict zones.”

Ferrara said that digital integration is crucial “so we can help our warfighters even when they are in the farthest corners of the globe. Integration helps us maintain clinical currency, train the next generation of military medical professionals, and support real-time care in dynamic environments.”

Taking advantage of the “vast and growing health data available” is vital, he said, by “not just documenting what has happened, but to anticipate what is next. We are now moving from health data collection to data-informed readiness.”

Ferrara discussed the integration of wearable technology to assess “warfighter performance and injury risk,” as an example of how the MHS is leveraging this health data for “real-time tracking of sleep patterns, heart rate variability, and exertion, combined with clinical records, to help flag early indicators of musculoskeletal injury or psychological stress.”

He described how the MHS is leveraging machine-language models to identify potential patterns that may exist and tie into common events experienced by service members, which was previously impossible, such as the individual longitudinal exposure record. “ILER is a critical tool allowing clinicians to access personalized exposure histories at the time of care, while simultaneously supporting population-level research on long-term outcomes like cancer or neurodegenerative disease,” said Ferrara. “The point here is not simply about having data—it’s about building systems that translate data quickly into insight and action, delivering better outcomes at the point of care and across the care continuum.”

He added, “This is how we support the warfighter not just during deployment, but across a lifetime, and how we strengthen our healthcare chain with evidence-based policy, clinical guidance, and surveillance systems that endure.”

Collaborating for the Future

He advocated for the need to create partnerships with government, academia, and domestic and foreign partners to ensure future readiness and healthcare innovation. “None of this work can succeed in silos. Our public-private partnerships are essential—not just for developing new tools, but for testing, scaling, and governing them responsibly,” said Ferrara. “We are deeply engaged with the VA, Health and Human Services, and other federal partners to create interoperable platforms and to help ensure continuity of care across the life of a service member.”

He also noted collaborations with NATO, allied medical forces, and humanitarian organizations “support interoperability during coalition operations and disaster response.”

“Domestically, we rely on civilian trauma partnerships, like the military-civilian partnership for trauma readiness, to certify that our providers remain trained in high-acuity, high-volume trauma care. These partnerships directly improve our operational response to mass casualty incidents and combat situations.”

He emphasized the need for the MHS to be “laser focused on thinking about fighting the next war, not the last war.”

“We are all focused on a mission that cuts across every sector represented: Delivering smarter, integrated, and data-driven health care for service members, veterans, and their families,” he said.
“This is the backbone of a connected system that allows service members’ medical history to follow them from basic training to the battlefield and ultimately into the VA EHR system,” Ferrara said.
It is also how we ensure that we are supporting the warfighter beyond the battlefield, providing continuity of care that spans service and system boundaries,” said Ferrara.
And that is the path we are walking together to support the warfighter, sustain our skills, and strengthen the healthcare chain that unites military, veteran, and civilian care.”","Interoperability is one of the biggest challenges facing service members and veterans in their lifelong health care experience, Dr. Stephen Ferrara, Acting Assistant Secretary of Defense for Health Affairs, said recently to a group of military and veteran healthcare leaders.

To address this, he said the Department of Defense’s ongoing collaboration with Department of Veterans Affairs, Department of Health and Human Services, and other federal partners remains vital to improving continuity of care for service members.

“We are all focused on a mission that cuts across every sector represented: Delivering smarter, integrated, and data-driven health care for service members, veterans, and their families,” he said.

“This is more than a technical conversation—it’s an operational imperative,” he continued. “The nature of warfare is changing. So is the nature of care. From polytrauma and blast injuries to long-term behavioral health challenges and environmental exposure risks, the people we serve need a healthcare system that is resilient, proactive, and agile enough to adapt in real time.”

Addressing the complexities of the MHS, Ferrara stressed, “Our purpose remains constant: To deliver world-class, operationally relevant, and future-ready health care—not just in hospitals and clinics, but on ships, in operational medical units across combat zones, and increasingly in the digital space.”

He talked about the urgency of having “a single, secure electronic health record across all military treatment facilities—one that spans operational, deployed, and garrison environments.”

In 2024, DOD completed a seven-year, multi-billion dollar project to deploy MHS GENESIS at all military hospitals and clinics as the DOD’s single electronic health record. “This is the backbone of a connected system that allows service members’ medical history to follow them from basic training to the battlefield and ultimately into the VA EHR system,” Ferrara said.

MHS GENESIS will ultimately provide a seamless healthcare experience for service members moving from the MHS to the VA by providing “access to their complete clinical history, from battlefield treatment notes to neuroimaging records, and mental health encounters.”

“That is not just a matter of convenience; it is the difference between proactive, effective care and fragmented follow-up. It is also how we ensure that we are supporting the warfighter beyond the battlefield, providing continuity of care that spans service and system boundaries,” said Ferrara.

Ferrara noted three areas of focus to modernize the EHR experience:

Artificial intelligence-powered decision support tools to identify early signs of posttraumatic stress disorder, traumatic brain injuries, and suicide risk

Remote monitoring systems for chronic disease and post-operative care

Expanded virtual health capabilities that allow surgical consultations from deployed hospital units and behavioral health visits from remote duty stations

He said with these capabilities, it would allow the MHS to “deliver care in what is being called the ‘fourth space’ of health care—beyond hospitals, clinics, and home. In this new digital space, information moves faster than geography, connecting care teams and patients across domains, countries, and conflict zones.”

Ferrara said that digital integration is crucial “so we can help our warfighters even when they are in the farthest corners of the globe. Integration helps us maintain clinical currency, train the next generation of military medical professionals, and support real-time care in dynamic environments.”

Taking advantage of the “vast and growing health data available” is vital, he said, by “not just documenting what has happened, but to anticipate what is next. We are now moving from health data collection to data-informed readiness.”

Ferrara discussed the integration of wearable technology to assess “warfighter performance and injury risk,” as an example of how the MHS is leveraging this health data for “real-time tracking of sleep patterns, heart rate variability, and exertion, combined with clinical records, to help flag early indicators of musculoskeletal injury or psychological stress.”

He described how the MHS is leveraging machine-language models to identify potential patterns that may exist and tie into common events experienced by service members, which was previously impossible, such as the individual longitudinal exposure record.

“ILER is a critical tool allowing clinicians to access personalized exposure histories at the time of care, while simultaneously supporting population-level research on long-term outcomes like cancer or neurodegenerative disease,” said Ferrara.

“The point here is not simply about having data—it’s about building systems that translate data quickly into insight and action, delivering better outcomes at the point of care and across the care continuum.”

He added, “This is how we support the warfighter not just during deployment, but across a lifetime, and how we strengthen our healthcare chain with evidence-based policy, clinical guidance, and surveillance systems that endure.”

Collaborating for the Future

He advocated for the need to create partnerships with government, academia, and domestic and foreign partners to ensure future readiness and healthcare innovation.

“None of this work can succeed in silos. Our public-private partnerships are essential—not just for developing new tools, but for testing, scaling, and governing them responsibly,” said Ferrara. “We are deeply engaged with the VA, Health and Human Services, and other federal partners to create interoperable platforms and to help ensure continuity of care across the life of a service member.”

He also noted collaborations with NATO, allied medical forces, and humanitarian organizations “support interoperability during coalition operations and disaster response.”

“Domestically, we rely on civilian trauma partnerships, like the military-civilian partnership for trauma readiness, to certify that our providers remain trained in high-acuity, high-volume trauma care. These partnerships directly improve our operational response to mass casualty incidents and combat situations.”

He emphasized the need for the MHS to be “laser focused on thinking about fighting the next war, not the last war.”

“The mission of the MHS is clear,” he continued, “Deliver a truly integrated, digitally enabled, globally partnered system of readiness and care.”

“It is a future in which data is no longer a barrier, but a bridge. That is the promise of our work. And that is the path we are walking together to support the warfighter, sustain our skills, and strengthen the healthcare chain that unites military, veteran, and civilian care.”",https://health.mil/-/media/Images/MHS/DVIDS/Articles/news499413.jpg?sc_lang=en&hash=CFBF75AEC1B939BCEF6BA45E8839261495750DF8,N,0.0,2025-06-03 11:56:51.986159

A team led by University of Virginia School of Medicine researcher James Stone, MD, PhD, has received $3.2 million from the federal Department of Defense to enhance a critical tool for protecting the brain health of military personnel.

The project aims to upgrade the Generalized Blast Exposure Value (GBEV) tool that assigns a numerical score to a service member’s history of blast exposures that can be used to assess the potential for adverse health outcomes.

“This will represent a major step forward in how the military monitors, protects and cares for its service members,” said Stone, a UVA Health radiologist. “This kind of translational research has the potential to directly inform policy, improve training safety and guide individualized medical decisions for those who serve.”

Understanding Blast Exposures

The project builds on close to two decades of research by Stone and his collaborators that seeks to better understand how repeated exposure to blasts – common in military training and combat – affects the brain over time.

Regular, low-level blast exposures from weapons or breaching, where explosives are used to enter buildings or other structures, can cause cumulative brain injuries and subtle but meaningful changes in brain function. To measure the impact of these blast exposures, Stone has been working with Capt. Stephen Ahlers (retired), PhD, at Naval Medical Research Command to utilize the Blast Exposure Threshold Survey (BETS) and GBEV to link neurological changes to career blast exposures in service members and veterans.

“I’ve had the privilege of working with Dr. Ahlers for more than 18 years, and our collaboration has led to many key contributions in the field of repeated low-level blast exposure. His deep expertise in military brain health research and unwavering commitment to service member health have been instrumental in developing tools like the GBEV,” Stone said. “This continued partnership forms an important foundation for advancing our shared goal of protecting brain health in military populations.”

About the Project

Their latest project will bring together data from more than 16,000 service member assessments across 10 previous research studies, spanning diverse military groups, to refine and strengthen the GBEV tool. The aim is to give the Department of Defense a more precise, data-driven way to identify at-risk individuals, guide protective measures and drive the care that members of the military receive.

“We are also incorporating key members of the Department of Defense public health community – including representatives from the services and the Defense Health Agency – into this effort,” Ahlers said. “By integrating these components, we aim to enhance support for the warfighter, operational units, Department of Defense public health entities and both Department of Defense and Department of Veterans Affairs health providers working to monitor and mitigate the effects of blast exposure on warfighter and veteran health and performance.”
