TRICARE beneficiaries, like all families, want care that’s timely, reliable, and responsive to their needs.

Through the TRICARE Prime® Demo by CareSource Military & Veterans™ we are providing a new option for military families in the greater Atlanta and Tampa areas. Our goal is simple: listen and work with beneficiaries to build on what TRICARE already does well and find opportunities to grow together.

I know what you might be thinking — just another demonstration. But what sets this one apart is who’s behind it: a team of veterans, spouses, and TRICARE beneficiaries who know the system firsthand and are committed to making it work for military families. We bring something different to the table — real-world managed care experience, a people-first culture. Our teams are made up of veterans, retirees, military spouses, and TRICARE beneficiaries who understand the challenges of a PCS.

We’re making care accessible, coordinated, and personal. We’re connecting families with local providers and resources who understand military culture. We’re offering a high-touch customer service approach. And we’re investing in systems and partnerships that meet the needs of military families.

Veterans Day is more than a date on the calendar; it’s a reminder that freedom and security come at a cost, and that those who served our nation are entitled to the same sense of safety and peace they fought to protect.

One of the most powerful ways to show appreciation is by helping our veterans make the most of the benefits they’ve earned. Today’s array of federal programs covering health care, housing, education, insurance, and retirement savings can provide a strong foundation for lifelong financial stability. But these benefits are complex and often underused. Knowing where to start can make all the difference.

Mapping your benefits to a real plan

Veterans’ finances are different because military service connects to nearly every part of a financial plan. Health care, disability compensation, GI Bill education benefits, TRICARE, and tax-free payments all interact in ways that can either strengthen or complicate a family’s long-term goals.

Begin by taking inventory. Gather your service record and note any exposure history, since the PACT Act has expanded eligibility for health care and disability compensation to many veterans who were previously excluded. Verify your disability rating and dependent status and review your education benefits under the Post-9/11 or Montgomery GI Bill programs.

Even if you are healthy, enrolling in VA health care is an important step. It keeps your record active, builds a relationship with a primary care provider, and makes future claims easier to process. Think of it as a continuation of the self-care that keeps you and your family strong.

For those receiving disability benefits, note that payments increased by 2.5% for 2025, reflecting the latest cost-of-living adjustment.

Housing: turning service into stability

Few benefits have transformed more lives than the VA home loan. For veterans with full entitlement, there are no loan limits. This presents an enormous advantage for buyers in higher-cost housing markets. The program’s funding fee can often be waived for service-connected disability, and closing timelines today can rival conventional loans when paperwork is in order.

For veterans considering a move, understanding entitlement restoration rules can help preserve eligibility for future purchases. Home ownership remains one of the most enduring ways to build wealth, and the VA loan continues to make that dream attainable for those who served.

Education and career transitions

Education has long been part of America’s promise to its veterans. The GI Bill still offers some of the most generous tuition and housing benefits available anywhere. As of Aug. 1, 2025, new academic-year rates are in effect through July 2026, with the monthly housing allowance tied to the rate for an E-5 with dependents in the school’s ZIP code.

A major change this year comes from the Supreme Court’s Rudisill v. McDonough decision, which allows many veterans who earned both the Montgomery and Post-9/11 GI Bills to use both programs for up to 48 months of combined education benefits. That is a significant win for those pursuing new careers or credentials after service.

Veterans who have completed their education have the option to transfer their education benefits to a spouse or child, creating a meaningful legacy. Before enrolling, use the VA’s GI Bill Comparison Tool to evaluate programs and ensure the school is fully accredited and transparent about costs.

Preserving income, insurance and retirement

Financial security also depends on preserving income and protecting loved ones. The VA’s VALife program, introduced in 2023, offers guaranteed-acceptance whole-life insurance coverage up to $40,000 for veterans age 80 or younger. Those currently insured under the older S-DVI program have until Dec. 31, 2025, to apply for VALife while maintaining existing coverage during the two-year transition period.

As of this fall, more than $2 billion in VALife coverage has been issued, proof that many veterans are taking advantage of this new option. Meanwhile, TRICARE premiums and dental fees for 2025 have been updated; small adjustments can add up over time, so be sure to account for those in your budget.

Service members under the Blended Retirement System should continue contributing enough to capture the 5% Thrift Savings Plan match. This effectively is free money, and one of the simplest ways to strengthen long-term security. And remember that VA disability payments are tax-free, which can affect whether a Roth or traditional account makes more sense for your retirement savings.

Five fast moves every veteran should consider

Document any toxic exposure: The PACT Act expansions mean more veterans now qualify for early care and compensation.

Time your education start: GI Bill housing allowances reset each Aug. 1, so plan enrollment around that date.

Check your Certificate of Eligibility: Full entitlement can remove loan limits under the VA program.

Review your life insurance coverage: Compare private-term policies with the new VALife program, especially before the 2025 S-DVI deadline.

Revisit your TRICARE budget: Premium and dental costs changed this year, adjust accordingly.

A message of gratitude

This Veterans Day, our gratitude extends beyond words. We thank every service member and family who has shouldered the burden of duty and wish to remind them that financial well-being is part of the peace they’ve earned.

Take this Veterans Day as a moment to review your benefits, update your plan, and ensure the security you defended continues here at home.

This seems contradictory to the shutdown guidance exempting private-sector care from the shutdown’s effects.
TRICARE also says the open season enrollment window for 2026 coverage remains on schedule despite the shutdown.
Furloughs among non-excepted Defense civilians slow everything from maintenance to program management to installation services.
The Bottom Line for Readiness From flight demonstrations to weekend drills to program awards, the shutdown is eroding predictability.","The federal government shut down at 11:59 p.m. EDT on September 30, 2025. Under the government’s official “Lapse in Appropriations” guidance, uniformed personnel stay on duty and most Defense civilians supporting “excepted” missions continue working, but normal pay is paused until Congress enacts funding. The formal Defense guidance for this shutdown reiterates that active servicemembers “may be assigned to carry out non-excepted activities in place of furloughed civilian personnel only to the extent that the non-excepted activity is capable of performance without incurring new obligations.

Paycheck Funding

Mid-month, President Trump directed the Pentagon to use “all available funds” so troops would receive pay despite the lapse. Reporting indicates the department moved to repurpose about $8 billion in unobligated R&D accounts to cover the October 15 payroll, and later acknowledged accepting a $130 million private donation to help offset military pay. Those extraordinary measures do not fully resolve uncertainty.

Training and Drill Impacts

Across the reserve component, routine training weekends are being postponed in many places. The National Guard Association of the United States advises that typical drill periods are not authorized during a shutdown unless they support excepted activities, and units are issuing state-by-state guidance.

High-visibility events are taking hits, too. The Navy’s Blue Angels skipped San Francisco Fleet Week this month because of the shutdown’s travel and funding limits. The team’s annual homecoming at NAS Pensacola was cancelled entirely, as base officials cited uncertainty around funding and logistics.

Health Care and TRICARE

Defense Health Agency operations continue in a constrained environment. TRICARE has told beneficiaries that they may keep appointments with civilian providers and that coverage remains in effect, but the agency has warned that processing and paying new medical claims for care received on or after October 1 may be delayed until funding is restored. This seems contradictory to the shutdown guidance exempting private-sector care from the shutdown’s effects. TRICARE also says the open season enrollment window for 2026 coverage remains on schedule despite the shutdown.

Commissaries, Schools, and On-Base Life

Defense Commissary Agency leaders say stores are operating normally for now and have enough working-capital funding to continue operations for at least 60 days, but have cautioned that extended lapses could force closures when funds are exhausted. Local updates from installations echo that message: commissaries remain open today, while warning that prolonged shutdowns may trigger furloughs and closures.

DoDEA schools have continued operating, but some extracurriculars and support functions are being temporarily paused or cancelled until further notice. Family-support organizations are pointing service members to relief programs and are updating installation-specific changes as they occur.

Civilians, Contractors, and the Industrial Base

The Defense Department relies on a large civilian workforce and a sprawling industrial base. Furloughs among non-excepted Defense civilians slow everything from maintenance to program management to installation services. For industry, the rule of thumb is that work on already-funded contracts continues, but new obligations cannot be made unless the work is tied to an “excepted” activity. This means option awards, new starts, and many modifications stall, with cascading schedule and cost effects that worsen the longer the shutdown runs.

Delays are not abstract. Even a short pause in program actions creates backlogs of source selections, award notices, and production ramp decisions that must all be rescheduled, often pushing milestones into a new quarter and adding cost.

The Bottom Line for Readiness

From flight demonstrations to weekend drills to program awards, the shutdown is eroding predictability. While core operations continue and combatant commands remain manned, the compound effect of delayed training, paused travel, furloughed civilians, and slow-rolling contracts is a readiness tax that grows each week. Commissaries can operate on cash reserves only so long and TRICARE can promise access while warning of delayed payments. Neither of those are durable substitute for appropriations.

What service members and families can do now is practical: confirm unit-level drill and travel guidance; keep scheduled civilian medical appointments but anticipate possible TRICARE claim delays; monitor installation and commissary updates; and, if needed, tap relief resources advertised by commands and service aid societies while Congress works toward a funding bill.

My husband is on recruiting duty for the Army. This is the first place we have been that I’ve had to use Tricare. Everywhere else I was able to use US Family Health plan and had the best experiences. I chose Tricare Select because I wanted some choice in who I saw. I don’t have a problem with the copays, I’m just so frustrated that NO ONE knows how to use Tricare. I literally have to call after every single appointment when I get a bill cause they say my Tricare isn’t active (when it is) and they just refuse to run a manual check. I’ve been at the same place for over a year and still have this problem. We are an hour from an AF base and that’s where my husband goes for medical. I’ve been thinking about changing to Prime since open enrollment is upon us and just saying “f it!” And driving the hour. Problem is… I just found out I’m pregnant. I’m seeing an OB on select who delivers at the only hospital in network within a 30 minute drive. So would changing to prime and driving an hour really be too bad? I just know I can’t keep spending 30 minutes on the phone trying to explain Tricare to someone after every appointment. Plus, trying to figure out where I can get US and I just don’t think I can deal with the stress. All this to say… I hate Tricare.

U.S. Rep. Robert Aderholt (R-Haleyville) called the Fox Army Health Center's cut in services a ""direct consequence"" of actions from the left.
""On Day 38 of the shutdown, Redstone Arsenal's Fox Army Health Center will be reducing services,"" Aderholt said on X.
""The health center will prioritize active-duty personnel's primary care, while reducing Primary Care Medical Home services and suspending all on-post radiology services.","As the ongoing government shutdown enters a record 39th day, Redstone Arsenal's Fox Army Health Center is now prioritizing active-duty personnel's primary care, while limiting Primary Medical Home services. According to base officials, all non-urgent primary care needs are currently being redirected to the Tricare network, including radiology services.

The center's pharmacy operations will now be open just Monday through Wednesday. Its script center will remain accessible five days a week. Officials have also said that longer wait times are anticipated for non-urgent care, along with increased use of local urgent care centers and emergency rooms to help offset the reduction in services on base.

Specialty services, including optometry, behavioral health, physical therapy and essential force health protection, will remain operational.

U.S. Rep. Dale Strong (R-Huntsville), who represents the district that includes Redstone Arsenal, laid the blame for the operational changes on Democrats, arguing on X that the shutdown was ""completely avoidable.""

""The fallout from this completely avoidable Democrat shutdown continues to get worse for the folks in North Alabama, including thousands of veterans who rely on Redstone Arsenal's Fox Army Health Center for care,"" Strong wrote.

""On Day 38 of the shutdown, Redstone Arsenal's Fox Army Health Center will be reducing services,"" Aderholt said on X. ""Another direct consequence of Democrats refusing to open the government.""

""The health center will prioritize active-duty personnel's primary care, while reducing Primary Care Medical Home services and suspending all on-post radiology services. Non-urgent primary care, along with all radiology services, will be diverted to the Tricare network,"" Aderholt added.

Senate Democrats have now voted 14 times against reopening the government, with the most recent vote being 54-44. Democratic leadership on Friday indicated the party may continue to hold out, bolstered by the results in this week's elections.

Repair of nervous system collapse after years of adaptive survival.
Empowerment-Based Integrated Treatment (EBiT), developed and taught through NEI, provides this exact clinical framework - blending trauma-informed therapy, somatic regulation, psychedelic integration, functional medicine support, and consent-based nervous system recalibration.
""Veterans deserve access to care that honors the complexity of trauma - and supports long-term repair rather than long-term sedation,"" says Dr. Angela Fisher, Founder of Bionic Bloom + NEI.
""Accepting TRICARE allows us to bring this care to the heroes who were never given the chance to actually heal.""","Bionic Bloom Wellness Collective and The Neurodivergent Empowerment Institute (NEI) are proud to announce an expanded access initiative to support United States Veterans seeking trauma recovery and nervous system rehabilitation through integrative mental health treatment - with TRICARE now accepted for covered services.

This marks a groundbreaking shift in veteran care accessibility and aligns with the national urgency to provide trauma-informed, non-harm-based, non-pharmaceutical dependent pathways for healing.

The announcement will formally be introduced at the Cannadelic Global Summit on November 9, 2025 in St. Petersburg, FL, where Bionic Bloom and NEI will lead multiple sessions on veteran trauma, nervous system biology, and integrative recovery models.

Our Clinical Position:

Veterans do not simply need symptom management.

They need repair.

Repair of identity.

Repair of relational safety.

Repair of self-trust.

Repair of nervous system collapse after years of adaptive survival.

Empowerment-Based Integrated Treatment (EBiT), developed and taught through NEI, provides this exact clinical framework - blending trauma-informed therapy, somatic regulation, psychedelic integration, functional medicine support, and consent-based nervous system recalibration.

""Veterans deserve access to care that honors the complexity of trauma - and supports long-term repair rather than long-term sedation,"" says Dr. Angela Fisher, Founder of Bionic Bloom + NEI. ""Accepting TRICARE allows us to bring this care to the heroes who were never given the chance to actually heal.""

What This Means For Veterans:

Access to integrative trauma treatment through TRICARE

Veteran-specific IOP tracks available through NEI

If you’re wrestling with questions about your TRICARE coverage, benefits, or claims, you’re definitely not alone. TRICARE’s a solid military health care program, but figuring out who to call or how to get your issue squared away can feel like trying to crack a secret code. Whether you’re a service member, family member, or retired military, understanding where to start is crucial. So, what are the usual reasons folks reach out to TRICARE?

Updating or verifying coverage and enrollment details.

Getting help with claims and understanding benefits.

Finding in-network providers or urgent care info.

Managing your military health system online accounts like milConnect or MHS GENESIS.

Getting answers on pharmacy benefits or prescriptions.

One thing that might surprise you: many TRICARE users trip up when contacting customer service because they jump straight in without their paperwork or digital accounts handy. Having your sponsor’s DOD ID number and your personal info within reach makes the whole process smoother.

Pro Tip: Different questions and regions have different contact points, so knowing which TRICARE area you fall under is key before reaching out.

Channels to Reach TRICARE: Phone, Online, and Mail Breakdown

When it comes to actually contacting TRICARE, you have options, and each carries its own pros and cons. Phone calls can be quick, but wait times vary. Online portals offer convenience but sometimes lack the personal touch. Mail feels a bit old school but is necessary for formal requests or appeals.

By Phone

Dialing up TRICARE directly is often the fastest way to handle urgent issues. You can find the right phone number on the official TRICARE website—there’s a list organized by region and specific services. For instance, the Call Us page breaks down numbers depending on your needs, whether it’s West Region, East Region, or overseas.

Heads up: peak call times can mean long waits. Calling earlier in the morning or later in the afternoon might just save you some time.

Online Portals

TRICARE’s online presence is pretty solid. The Contact Us main page links to milConnect and other tools that let you check your enrollment, claims, and health records. Accessing your online account means you can often resolve simple questions without ever making a call.

This video walks you through a real interaction with TRICARE customer care, highlighting how to find the right number and what kind of questions to ask. It’s a handy watch if you want to mentally prepare before picking up the phone.

Mail and Fax

Though less common, some TRICARE requests still require sending documents by mail or fax, especially for formal appeals or notarized paperwork. Check your specific regional guidelines on the TRICARE site—this is more common when dealing with claims or beneficiary updates.

Not to be overlooked: mailing might add days or even weeks to your timeline, so consider phone or online options first unless the form explicitly says to send hard copies.

Expert Tips for Streamlining Your TRICARE Communication

Want to skip the frustration? Here’s what the pros suggest:

Have your info ready: DOD ID, Social Security number (if required), and a detailed description of your question or issue.

Know your region: TRICARE West, East, or Overseas—this dictates which contact center you’ll deal with.

Use online tools: Many common tasks like checking claim status or updating info can be done through milConnect, saving you time on the phone.

Prepare for verification: Customer reps will ask security questions to verify identity for privacy reasons—don’t be thrown off when they do.

Be patient but persistent: Customer service can sometimes get busy, but if you feel stuck, politely ask to escalate to a supervisor.

Also, as highlighted by TriWest Healthcare Alliance’s contact page, having straightforward and clear questions helps reps assist you more effectively—prepping your concerns before the call can shave off a lot of back-and-forth.

Avoiding Pitfalls: Common Mistakes When Contacting TRICARE

Here’s the thing: a lot of the headache comes from avoidable mistakes. Don’t fall into these traps:

Not confirming your region or plan: Calling the wrong number sends you into a loop of transfers.

Skipping account logins: Many issues are resolved online if you just took a minute to set up or access your accounts.

Missing key documents: Not having your ID numbers or claim info handy can turn a quick call into a long crawl.

Rushing without notes: Juggling complicated benefits questions without jotting down reps’ names or reference numbers leads to confusion later.

Newcomers especially forget that TRICARE covers different services under different contractors, so asking a generic question can cause mixed info. Narrow down your inquiry before calling.

What to Expect During Your TRICARE Inquiry: Timeline and Responses

When you contact TRICARE, keep in mind the timeline can shift based on the type of inquiry:

Typical TRICARE Inquiry Response Times Inquiry Type Response Mode Expected Response Time Claims and Billing Questions Phone & Online Within 1-3 business days Enrollment or Coverage Changes Phone, Online, or Mail Up to 2 weeks (mail longer) Pharmacy & Prescription Issues Phone Within 24-48 hours General Benefits Questions Phone & Online Within 1-5 business days

Don’t expect instant resolution every time—some questions require checking with medical providers or verification from other agencies.

Step-by-Step Guide: Preparing Before You Contact TRICARE

Getting your ducks in a row before you pick up the phone or jump into your online account can turn what feels like a daunting chore into a breeze.

Step 1: Identify Your Plan and Region

First, double-check which TRICARE plan you have (Prime, Select, Young Adult, etc.) and the region (East, West, Overseas). This info steers you toward the right contact point.

Step 2: Gather Personal Information

Have your sponsor’s DOD ID number, your Social Security number if applicable, date of birth, and any claim or case numbers ready.

Step 3: Write Down Your Questions

Jot down what you want to ask, including any related dates, provider names, or claim details. This helps keep the conversation focused.

Step 4: Choose Your Contact Method

If it’s a quick status check, online is great. For complex issues, pick up the phone. And for formal updates or appeals, consider mail.

Step 5: Have Pen and Paper Ready

During your contact, write down the names of reps, confirmation numbers, and any details on next steps.

I’ll speak not just as a retired pediatrician, but as someone who once believed that measurable goals were enough.","For decades, I practiced developmental-behavioral pediatrics with a focus on coordinated care, measurable goals, and clinical accountability. I believed that if we could define a child’s needs clearly and track progress with integrity, we could build systems that honored both science and dignity.

But I now realize I missed something critical.

After reviewing the #BanABA initiative and speaking with Dr. Henny Kupferstein, I’ve come to understand the full scope of harm linked to applied behavior analysis (ABA) therapy. This isn’t just about outdated methods or billing irregularities. It’s about documented patterns of physical and psychological trauma, especially among nonspeaking autistic individuals and those who rely on AAC. It’s about a system that too often prioritizes compliance over communication, normalization over neurodiversity.

In 2016, I raised formal concerns about the TRICARE ABA pilot in Washington State. United HealthCare (UHC) stonewalled the inquiry. For them it was a big moneymaker, without oversight from the DOD. I was the one who attempted oversight after receiving a communication from Senator John McCain, Chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee. The army labeled me as a troublemaker and forced me into learning the SBAR communication method. Despite that, it was “good trouble,” using Representative John Lewis’ definition: when the senator and I questioned both the cost and the absence of measurable goals needed to justify continued paying for services under the pilot. UHC considered the pilot as an entitlement to increase corporate profits only, not to help children with ASD. That obstruction may have triggered Congress to authorize the largest ABA study ever conducted under TRICARE. But the study focused on cost-effectiveness, not trauma. I was asking about harm. About dignity. About whether we were truly helping the children we claimed to serve.

Earlier in my career, as medical director of the Autism Program at Easter Seals in Peoria, I routinely marked “NMG” (No Measurable Goals) in red Sharpie on therapy proposals for ABA, PT, OT, and speech that lacked clinical rigor. I was supported by the clinic director and the pediatric chairman. We weren’t rejecting therapy; we were demanding accountability. But even then, I didn’t fully grasp the trauma described by autistic adults and self-advocates.

I now recognize that ABA’s faults go far deeper than poor documentation:

A harmful focus on conformity: Many self-advocates argue that ABA’s goal of making autistic individuals appear “normal” can punish harmless traits like stimming or echolalia.

Psychological harm: Research and personal accounts suggest that behavior modification, when coercive, can cause lasting trauma and reinforce the idea that autistic ways of being are inherently wrong.

Better alternatives exist: Communication-based therapies, especially those that honor autonomy and consent, may offer more meaningful support, particularly for nonspeaking individuals who use behavior as language.

This isn’t just a clinical debate. It’s a civic reckoning.

I’ve come to understand that ABA’s widespread adoption was not driven by consensus among developmental pediatricians, but by insurance mandates, billing incentives, and a cultural push for normalization. In many cases, ABA was the only reimbursable option, regardless of its appropriateness or ethical standing. Families were cornered. Clinicians were pressured. And children were subjected to interventions that may have caused more harm than help.

So, what are the alternatives?

There are evidence-informed, dignity-centered approaches that prioritize communication, autonomy, and relationship-building over compliance:

Developmental and relationship-based models (e.g., DIR/Floortime): These approaches focus on emotional connection, co-regulation, and following the child’s lead. They support social-emotional development without coercion.

Augmentative and alternative communication (AAC) support: For nonspeaking individuals, access to robust AAC systems, paired with communication partners trained in modeling and respect, is essential. Communication is not a reward; it’s a right.

Occupational therapy with a sensory integration lens: When practiced ethically, OT can help children understand and regulate their sensory experiences without suppressing natural behaviors.

Presume competence frameworks: These approaches reject deficit-based assumptions and instead presume that every individual has the capacity to learn, communicate, and participate meaningfully, given the right supports.

Peer-mediated and naturalistic interventions: These emphasize learning in real-world contexts, often with neurotypical peers, and avoid rigid drill-based instruction.

These models are not perfect, but they are rooted in respect. They prioritize consent. They do not rely on token economies, forced eye contact, or compliance as a proxy for progress.

I now support a federal ban on coercive behavioral interventions. I believe it’s time to listen to autistic voices, not override them. It’s time to stop rewarding systems that monetize compliance and start investing in models that respect neurodiversity, autonomy, and informed consent.

This shift is personal. It’s professional. And it’s overdue.

I’ll appear on The Podcast by KevinMD to share this journey, from early objection to ethical awakening. I’ll speak not just as a retired pediatrician, but as someone who once believed that measurable goals were enough. They’re not. Not if the goals themselves are rooted in erasure.

I’ll also speak as an author. In my memoir The Quiet Architect, I reflect on the systems we build, and the ones we must dismantle. I’ve included an excerpt that documents my early challenge to ABA at the federal level, supported by Senator John McCain. That moment wasn’t just a clinical objection. It was a warning.

Today, I add my voice to the #BanABA initiative. I do so with humility, clarity, and resolve. I do so knowing that silence is complicity, and that legacy is not just what we build, but what we’re willing to unbuild.

This is my public pivot. My red Sharpie moment has become a reckoning.

This study assessed whether statin use after lung cancer diagnosis is associated with overall survival among MHS beneficiaries with lung cancer. METHODS: This study was based on the Military Cancer Epidemiology (MilCanEpi) database, a database linking the DoD's Central Cancer Registry (CCR) and the MHS Data Repository (MDR). The study subjects were MHS beneficiaries diagnosed with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Information on statin use was extracted from the database. Time-dependent Cox proportional hazard regression model was used to estimate hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% confidence intervals (95% CIs) comparing post-diagnosis use of statin relative to non-users. RESULTS: Among the 5096 patients, 864 patients used a statin after NSCLC diagnosis. Compared to individuals who never used statin, increased cumulative use of statin (per one-year of use) among the users conferred a significantly improved survival with an adjusted HR of 0.82 (95% CI=0.75-0.90). In stratified analysis, the survival benefit or its tendency associated with increased cumulative use was observed regardless of age, race, sex, tumor stage, comorbidity index or baseline use. CONCLUSIONS: Post-diagnosis statin use was associated with improved survival among NSCLC patients in a universal healthcare system.

The impact of exposure to morally injurious events on posttraumatic stress symptoms among Israeli combat Veterans: a longitudinal moderated mediation model of moral injury outcomes and dispositional forgiveness

Abstract: Background: Exposure to potentially morally injurious events (PMIEs) during military service can lead to moral injury (MI) outcomes and posttraumatic stress symptoms (PTSS). This longitudinal study examined the relationships between PMIE exposure, MI outcomes, and PTSS among Israeli combat veterans, and the potential protective role of dispositional forgiveness in these associations. Method: Participants were 169 Israeli combat veterans who participated in a six-year longitudinal study with four measurement points (T1: 12 months before enlistment, T2: Six months following enlistment- pre-deployment, T3: 18 months following enlistment- post-deployment, and T4: 28 months following discharge). Participants’ characteristics were assessed via semi-structured interviews (T1) and validated self-report measures (T2-T4) between 2019-2024. Results: Approximately 36% of participants reported exposure to PMIEs during service, with 13% exceeding the clinical threshold for probable PTSD at T4. PMIE-Betrayal at T3 was positively associated with MI outcomes of shame and trust violation at T4. The indirect effect of PMIEs on PTSS through MI outcome-Shame depended on forgiveness levels. Among veterans with low forgiveness, higher exposure to PMIE-Betrayal was associated with increased MI shame, which was linked to more severe PTSS. Conversely, for those with high forgiveness, exposure to PMIE-Self and Other was associated with decreased MI shame and subsequently reduced PTSS. Conclusion: Dispositional forgiveness moderates the relationship between PMIE exposure and MI outcomes, particularly shame, which mediates the development of PTSS. These findings highlight forgiveness as a potential target for intervention in treating moral injury and preventing PTSS among combat veterans.",https://www.centreforevidence.org/website/img/og--default.png,N,0.0,2025-11-07 20:22:07.473811

Tricare health plans, critical to many military and retiree households across the U.S., will become more expensive in 2026. The Military Health System’s announcement, made Nov. 7, calls for a 2 to 3 percent increase in most Tricare costs. Prices for prescription drugs are particularly hard hit, and can rise by more than 15 percent. These adjustments affect both the annual registration fees and the deductibles and co-payments.

For many Tricare Prime and Tricare Select users, this means they will face higher costs for annual enrollment and medical services. The monthly premiums for Tricare Reserve Select and Tricare Young Adult members, which have already increased in 2025, are particularly hard hit. The Tricare open enrollment period, during which members can change their health insurance for the coming year, runs from November 10th to December 9th.

The current cost for the Tricare Dental Program will remain unchanged through February 2026. The cost of Tricare depends on which “group” members belong to, which is determined by the date the member first entered military service. Group A includes those who entered the service before January 1, 2018, while Group B includes those who entered after that date.

Active duty families don’t pay annual enrollment fees for Tricare Prime or Tricare Select, but retirees do, and they will see increases next year. Group A retirees enrolled in Tricare Select will see their annual enrollment fee increase from $364.92 to $375 for a family and from $181.92 to $186.96 for an individual. Group A retirees using Tricare Prime will see an increase in the enrollment fee for a family plan from $744 to $765, while the cost for an individual will rise from $372 to $381.96 annually.",https://www.it-boltwise.de/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/amazon-logo.png,N,-1.0,2025-11-07 20:22:12.246969

TRICARE Open Season 2025 is just around the corner, running from Nov. 10 to Dec. 9, and this is your once-a-year opportunity to review your health care coverage and decide if you’d like to make changes for the year ahead. Whether you’re enrolling for the first time or simply evaluating your current plan, taking a little time now can help ensure the right fit for you and your family when new coverage takes effect on Jan. 1, 2026.

TRICARE offers multiple health plan options, and the two most commonly used in the US are TRICARE Prime and TRICARE Select.

Prime functions more like an HMO, with lower out-of-pocket costs and care coordinated through your primary care manager—ideal for those comfortable with a structured care system.

TRICARE Select provides greater flexibility in choosing providers without needing referrals, though it typically comes with slightly higher costs. Overseas beneficiaries also have tailored Prime and Select options, and some regions offer the US Family Health Plan, providing care through community-based provider networks.

To compare plans, start with three easy tools: the TRICARE Plan Finder to see your eligibility, the Compare Plans Tool to review benefits side-by-side, and your 2025 cost information to understand expected expenses. If you’re also considering dental or vision coverage, remember that these come through FEDVIP during Federal Benefits Open Season, which ends one day earlier—Dec. 8.

The CY 2026 monthly premiums for TRICARE Reserve Select, TRICARE Retired Reserve, and TRICARE Young Adult and the quarterly premiums for Continued Health Care Benefit Program will be posted to the tricare.mil/changes web page once announced.

Some TRICARE premiums and copayments will increase in 2026, with pharmacy copayments rising for most US Family Health Plan members.

Check your specific plan: Review your individual plan details for the most accurate information on any potential increases or changes to your monthly premiums or copayments.

Compare plans: Use the BENEFEDS plan comparison tool to compare 2025 and 2026 pricing for your dental and vision plans to make an informed decision about whether to change plans or stay with your current one.

What’s New for TRICARE in 2026

*Source: Federal Register notice on program changes for CY 2026

Mail-Order Prescription Refills: Beneficiaries must now confirm refills before shipments are sent. Unconfirmed prescriptions will be paused but can be restarted anytime before expiration.

No Cost-Share for Contraceptives: TRICARE-covered contraceptives under the pharmacy benefit now have $0 cost-sharing, improving access and affordability.

Weight-Loss Drug Coverage (with Limits): Medications for treating obesity may be covered when medically necessary, prescribed by a TRICARE network provider, and part of a supervised treatment plan.

Gender-Affirming Hormone Therapy Policy Change: TRICARE will no longer cover hormone therapy or puberty blockers for minors (18 and under), in accordance with FY 2025 NDAA provisions.

No More Drive-Time Waiver: Prime enrollees who move within 100 miles of a military treatment facility may stay in Prime without requesting a waiver.

Expanded Medical Coverage: New or expanded coverage includes:

Minimally invasive procedures for uterine fibroids

For many who are transitioning out of the military, the biggest question is: What now? Leaving uniform behind often means leaving a clearly defined mission, a team, and a sense of purpose. Rebuilding that identity in civilian life can be challenging—but for growing numbers of veterans, skilled trades are becoming a natural next chapter.

Across the country, there is renewed interest in trade careers. Industries like advanced manufacturing, construction, logistics, renewable energy, machining, welding, gunsmithing, automotive, and drone technology are facing real shortages of skilled workers. These are career fields where the work is hands-on, practical, and tied directly to results.

The military trains problem solvers. Service members are used to thinking critically under pressure, working as a team, mastering technical tasks, and taking pride in doing things the right way. Whether maintaining aircraft, repairing equipment in the field, securing communications networks, or keeping operations running in uncertain environments—service members build the exact mindset that trade industries value.

Many trade schools and technical programs today are built with veterans in mind—offering flexibility, online and hybrid formats, hands-on labs, and instructors who understand the transition process because they’ve lived it. At institutions like the Sonoran Desert Institute, for example, veterans learn in communities where their experience is respected, and their strengths are recognized as assets—not obstacles, according to Chief Academic Officer, Jarred McNeely.

But the point isn’t just training – it’s also finding purpose. When a veteran learns to restore a firearm, tune a machine, fabricate a part, or pilot a drone for precision surveying, they are not just learning a trade. They are building a new professional identity rooted in skill, expertise, and confidence, says McNeely.

Skilled trades are an ideal way for many veterans to continue to contribute, solve problems and serve their communities, just in a different uniform.

Additional trade schools and vocational programs include:

1. Universal Technical Institute (UTI) – UTI offers automotive, diesel, motorcycle, and marine technology programs and explicitly supports veterans in transitioning to civilian technical careers. They accept GI Bill benefits and highlight services designed for veteran students.

2. Rosedale Technical College – Rosedale Technical College has a dedicated veterans page stating that it supports veterans transitioning from the military to civilian trades, and has earned a “Military Friendly” designation.

3. IYRS School of Technology & Trades – Located in Rhode Island, IYRS is approved by the VA for GI Bill use and has resources for veterans through the Veteran Readiness & Employment program.

4. Virginia Technical Academy (VTA) – VTA offers trade certificate programs in HVAC, plumbing, electrical and building/property maintenance and states they are GI Bill-approved and have veteran graduates in those fields.

5. Apprenticeship/union-linked programs – Examples include the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers (IBEW) Veterans Electrical Entry Program (VEEP), the United Association Veterans in Piping (VIP) program, and the Workshops for Warriors machinist/welding training program for veterans. These often combine vocational training with apprenticeships and job placement.

This Veterans Day, honoring service means more than reflection. It means helping those who served find their next mission—one built with pride, craftsmanship, and purpose. And for many, the trades are exactly where that mission begins.

If you’re a military retiree or a beneficiary who’s hit the age of 65 and probably looking ahead to healthcare options, TRICARE For Life (TFL) might already be on your radar. But what exactly is it, and why should you care? TRICARE For Life acts as a secondary payer to Medicare, meaning it helps cover costs that Medicare doesn’t, like copayments and deductibles. This combination can make a huge difference in out-of-pocket expenses for veterans and their families.

So, who qualifies for TRICARE For Life? Typically, it’s available to Medicare-eligible military retirees, their spouses, survivors, and certain former spouses. The key condition is enrollment in both Medicare Part A and Part B. If you haven’t signed up for Medicare Part B yet, well, you’ll want to get on that fast — it is essential.

Qualifying for this program opens up a lifetime of enhanced healthcare coverage and peace of mind. According to the official TRICARE For Life site, this benefit helps thousands of military families every year, easing the transition into Medicare while keeping healthcare costs manageable. Not to mention, you get access to a nationwide network of providers familiar with military health.

Step-by-Step Application Process: From Gathering Documents to Submission

Applying for TRICARE For Life might seem daunting at first glance, but trust me, once you break it down, it’s straightforward. Here’s a simple walkthrough that’ll have you covered in no time.

Step 1: Check Your Eligibility

Before anything else, make sure you’re enrolled in both Medicare Part A and Part B. TFL works as a supplement to these Medicare parts, so without them, you’re out of luck. Your status as a military retiree, spouse, or survivor should be well-documented from your military service records.

Step 2: Gather Required Documents

Copy of your Medicare card

Military identification and retiree documents

Social Security Number

Proof of residency

Having all these handy ensures a smooth process and speeds up verification.

Step 3: Submit Your Application

The easiest way is through the official TRICARE enrollment portal. Alternatively, you can mail in a paper application, but online is faster and less prone to mishaps. Keep an eye on confirmation emails and save copies of everything you submit.

Step 4: Wait for Approval and Card Issuance

After submission, your application typically processes within a few weeks. You’ll receive a TRICARE For Life card, which you’ll need to present when getting healthcare services.

This video breaks down how Medicare coordinates with TRICARE For Life, providing clear visuals on how and when each part kicks in — a great watch if you want to see the mechanics in action.

Common Pitfalls to Avoid When Applying for TRICARE For Life

Even with a clear guide, some usual headaches can trip up applicants. Here’s what to watch out for to dodge frustrating delays or denials.

Skipping Medicare Part B: Not enrolling in Medicare Part B on time is the quickest way to miss out. TRICARE For Life strictly requires both Medicare Parts A and B.

Incomplete or Incorrect Documentation: Forgetting to include your Medicare card copy or submitting outdated military paperwork can stall your application. Double-check documents before sending.

Missing Deadlines: Keep deadlines in mind for enrolling without penalties. Late Part B enrollment might mean higher premiums and coverage gaps.

Assuming Automatic Enrollment: TRICARE For Life does NOT enroll you automatically when you hit 65 or retire — you need to apply actively.

Paying attention to these details can save you months of hassle.

How to Maximize Your TRICARE For Life Benefits: Insider Tips

Now, onto the fun part: getting the most bang for your healthcare buck with TRICARE For Life. The program is generous but knowing how to navigate its quirks can stretch your benefits further.

Use Medicare-Participating Providers

To avoid surprises, pick providers who accept Medicare assignment. These professionals bill Medicare directly, which means your TRICARE benefits kick in without extra fuss.

Understand When TRICARE Covers Costs

Since TRICARE For Life is secondary payer coverage, it pays after Medicare processes claims. Knowing this helps you anticipate when to file claims or expect bills.

Enroll in Extra Programs

Depending on your health needs, pairing TRICARE with additional programs like the Extra or Standard TRICARE plans can be helpful, especially for services Medicare might not cover fully.

Keep Documentation Updated

Always keep your personal information and Medicare status current with TRICARE to prevent mix-ups in eligibility or billing.

According to My Army Benefits, leveraging both Medicare and TRICARE coverage efficiently is a top strategy for retirees, ensuring fewer out-of-pocket expenses and better healthcare experiences.

Real-Life User Scenarios: Navigating TRICARE For Life in Different Situations

The best way to understand TRICARE For Life might just be through stories from those who live it daily.

Scenario 1: The Newly Retired Veteran

Imagine Jim, who just retired from active duty at 65. He quickly signed up for Medicare Parts A and B and then applied for TRICARE For Life. During his annual checkup, Jim found that the doctor accepted Medicare assignment. Medicare paid first, then TFL covered the rest, leaving Jim with almost no copay. That saved him hundreds annually compared to his previous insurance.

Scenario 2: The Survivor Spouse Handling Paperwork

Linda, a widow of a veteran, struggled initially with getting her paperwork right after her spouse’s passing. She missed a deadline for Part B enrollment, which complicated her benefits temporarily. But after working closely with TRICARE’s support, she got her application approved and learned how to track deadlines going forward.

Scenario 3: Managing Care Overseas

Then there’s Paul, who lives abroad but qualifies for TFL. He discovered that understanding TRICARE’s overseas coverage rules was key to reducing surprises in billing and finding care options that accepted this coverage.

Keep your physical and digital cards in safe, accessible places. You’ll need them for appointments, pharmacy pickups, and any healthcare service.

Understand Your Coverage Limits

TRICARE For Life covers most medically necessary services, but some exclusions apply. Regularly reviewing updates through the TRICARE website or your provider helps avoid billing surprises.

Keep Your Medicare Info Current

Remember, TFL depends heavily on your Medicare status. Any changes in Medicare enrollment or coverage should be promptly reported to TRICARE.

Ask Questions and Seek Help

Pentagon data shows nearly 10% of service members cannot be deployed due to dental issues

Department of Health and Human Services did not consult with the military before announcing intention to direct CDC to stop recommending fluoridation of drinking water

Washington, D.C. – Today, U.S. Senator Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) released new data from the Department of Defense (DoD) revealing the impact of dental emergencies on military readiness. The new data also makes clear that Secretary of Health and Human Services (HHS) Robert F. Kennedy Jr.’s reported plan to direct the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) to stop recommending water fluoridation may lead to a substantial rise in dental decay for service members and their families. Senator Warren first pressed Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth about this concern in May 2025.

The Pentagon’s responses revealed:

Dental emergencies account for 20-30 percent of all Disease Non-Battle Injuries among deployed service members;

Dental issues leave nearly 10 percent of service members “not medically ready to deploy;”

The military was not consulted by HHS or Secretary Kennedy on the plan to direct the CDC to stop recommending water fluoridation;

Fluoridation has contributed to improved dental readiness across the military; and

Removing fluoridation would likely lead to increased rates of dental decay.

“Our military is already falling short on delivering high quality dental care for our service members, and Secretary Kennedy’s fluoride crusade is threatening to worsen this crisis and hurt our military’s ability to deploy where they’re needed,” said Senator Warren. “Our government should be focused on improving dental health access for our service members, not pushing anti-science conspiracies. I’m going to continue holding Secretary Kennedy accountable for his disastrous policies.”

In 2011, the Department of Defense found that “dental decay continues to be a major problem for military personnel and is a significant reason for personnel to be classified as non-deployable.” President Trump’s Deputy Under Secretary of Defense for Personnel and Readiness recently told Senator Warren that, “dental health issues are often the largest cause of non-deployability within a military unit.” Until now, the extent of the burden of dental issues on military readiness was not known.

In response to the Pentagon’s findings, Air Force Chief of Staff General Kenneth Wilsbach said, “[B]enefits of optimally fluoridated drinking water have been proven repeatedly…The Air Force Surgeon General supports maintaining fluoridated water systems in accordance with the 2013 DoW policy and the AF dental community strongly advocates to continue the policy of optimally fluoridated water on DoW installations.”

Senator Warren has led work to improve servicemembers’ access to health care:

In May 2025, U.S. Senator Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass), ranking member of the Personnel subcommittee for the Senate Armed Services Committee, pressed Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth on the harmful impact that Department of Health and Human Services Secretary Kennedy’s work to remove fluoride from drinking water would have on our military readiness.

In December 2024, U.S. Senator Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) sent a letter to Acting Under Secretary Vazirani raising continued concerns about the Department of Defense’s (DoD) failure to prevent price gouging and overpayments in the military’s TRICARE health program.

In June 2024, Senators Elizabeth Warren, Mike Rounds (R-S.D.), Peter Welch (D-Vt.), U.S. Representative Buddy Carter (R-Ga.), and 20 other lawmakers sent a letter to Assistant Secretary of Defense for Health Affairs Dr. Lester Martinez-Lopez and Director of the Defense Health Agency (DHA) Lieutenant General Telita Crosland, raising concerns over Express Scripts’ exclusive contract to administer TRICARE’s pharmacy program, the healthcare system for the military, retirees, and their families.

In July 2023, U.S. Senator Elizabeth Warren chaired a hearing of the Senate Armed Services Subcommittee on Personnel. She called out the Department of Defense (DoD) for wasting billions in taxpayers dollars due to price gouging by defense contractors for services and in health care, and identified opportunities for cost savings when DoD buys personnel-related goods and services.

In July 2023, U.S. Senator Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) sent a letter to Secretary of Defense Lloyd J. Austin III and Director of the Defense Health Agency (DHA), Lieutenant General Telita Crosland, regarding a series of DoD Inspector General (IG) reports finding that the Department of Defense (DoD) is failing to prevent price gouging and overpayments to contractors in the TRICARE health program.

On March 2, 2022, Senator Warren and her colleagues called out drug manufacturers for squeezing American families with rapid and widespread price hikes on prescription drugs.

In February 2022, at a hearing, Senator Warren called out corporations for abusing their market power to raise consumer prices and boost profits.

In May 2020, Senator Warren wrote to the Department requesting clarification on how the Department would prevent profiteering following a recent change to increase payments to contractors in response to the COVID-19 pandemic.

In March 2020, Senator Warren joined her colleagues in urging the FTC to use its full authority to prevent abusive price gouging on consumer health products during the COVID-19 pandemic.

Tricare open enrollment season, when members may change their health insurance coverage for the upcoming year, runs from Nov. 10 to Dec. 9.

The current costs for the Tricare Dental Program will last through February 2026.

Tricare Groups

Costs depend on which Tricare ""group"" members belong to, determined by the date the service member first entered the military. Group A consists of those who entered service before Jan. 1, 2018, while Group B includes those who entered after that date.

Enrollment Fees

Active-duty families pay no annual enrollment fees for either Tricare Prime or Tricare Select, but retirees do, and they’ll see increases in the upcoming year.

Group A retirees enrolled in Tricare Select will see their annual enrollment fee increase from $364.92 to $375 for a family and from $181.92 to $186.96 for an individual. Group A retirees using Tricare Prime will see the enrollment fee for a family plan increase from $744 to $765, while an individual's costs will go from $372 to $381.96 annually.

Retirees in Tricare Group B will see similar increases. The annual enrollment fee for the Prime family plan will rise from $900.96 to $927.00, while the individual plan will go from $450 to $462.96. Enrollment fees for Tricare Select will increase from $1,158.96 to $1,191 for a family and from $579 to $594.96 for an individual.

Deductibles

Annual deductibles -- the amount those using Tricare Select must pay out of pocket before Tricare makes any payments -- will also increase in 2026. Members using Tricare Prime don't pay deductibles.

Group A active-duty family members and retirees will see no changes to the deductible amount.

But a military member with the rank of E-4 or below in Group B will see their family deductible increase from $128 to $132, while families with sponsors E-5 and above in Group B will see their deductible rise from $386 to $397.

Individual military members in Group B will also see their deductibles rise in 2026, from $64 to $66 for E-4 and below, and from $193 to $198 for E-5 and above.

Copayments

Many copayments will also go up in the upcoming year. The cost of a primary care visit for active-duty Tricare Select users with a family in Group A will go from $27 to $28 in 2026, while the primary care copay for Group B family members will stay at $19.

Retirees using Tricare Select will see a primary care visit go from $37 to $38 in Group A and from $32 to $33 in Group B. Those using Tricare Prime will pay $26 for a primary care visit, up from $25.

Premiums

Some Tricare plans are premium-based, and those monthly premiums are going up in 2026.

For reservists, the premiums for Tricare Reserve Select will go from $53.80 per month to $57.88 per month for an individual member and from $274.48 to $286.66 for a family, increases of 7.6% and 4.4% respectively.

Tricare Retired Reserve premiums will increase from $631.26 to $645.90 for an individual, and from $1,513.04 to $1,548.30 for a family.

Premiums for the Tricare Young Adult Program for members' dependents ages 21 to 26 will go from $727 a month to $794 for Prime coverage, a 9.2% increase; and from $337 to $363 for Select, up 7.7%

Catastrophic Cap

The catastrophic cap is Tricare beneficiaries' maximum out-of-pocket cost for all health care provided each year. It limits beneficiaries' liability in the case of a serious illness or injury. Once a beneficiary has hit the cap through copayments or pharmacy charges during the year, Tricare will pay the rest in full.

Group A retirees using Tricare Select will see this cap increase in 2026 from $4,261 to $4,381; and for retirees in Group B, it will go up from $4,509 to $4,635.

While the cap for active-duty family members in Group A who have either Tricare Select or Tricare Prime will remain the same at $1,000 annually, those in Group B will see it increase from $1,288 to $1,324.

Whether you’re enrolling for the first time or simply evaluating your current plan, taking a little time now can help ensure the right fit for you and your family when new coverage takes effect on Jan. 1, 2026.

TRICARE offers multiple health plan options, and the two most commonly used in the US are TRICARE Prime and TRICARE Select.

Prime functions more like an HMO, with lower out-of-pocket costs and care coordinated through your primary care manager—ideal for those comfortable with a structured care system.

TRICARE Select provides greater flexibility in choosing providers without needing referrals, though it typically comes with slightly higher costs. Overseas beneficiaries also have tailored Prime and Select options, and some regions offer the US Family Health Plan, providing care through community-based provider networks.

To compare plans, start with three easy tools: the TRICARE Plan Finder to see your eligibility, the Compare Plans Tool to review benefits side-by-side, and your 2025 cost information to understand expected expenses. If you’re also considering dental or vision coverage, remember that these come through FEDVIP during Federal Benefits Open Season, which ends one day earlier—Dec. 8.

The CY 2026 monthly premiums for TRICARE Reserve Select, TRICARE Retired Reserve, and TRICARE Young Adult and the quarterly premiums for Continued Health Care Benefit Program will be posted to the tricare.mil/changes web page once announced.

Some TRICARE premiums and copayments will increase in 2026, with pharmacy copayments rising for most US Family Health Plan members.

Check your specific plan: Review your individual plan details for the most accurate information on any potential increases or changes to your monthly premiums or copayments.

Compare plans: Use the BENEFEDS plan comparison tool to compare 2025 and 2026 pricing for your dental and vision plans to make an informed decision about whether to change plans or stay with your current one.
