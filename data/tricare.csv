Crosland’s retirement was publicly announced Friday, but Reuters reported that the senior officer was told she must resign.
Crosland’s departure comes amid Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth’s efforts to eliminate diversity, equity, and inclusion initiatives at the Pentagon.
Last month, Hegseth said he believed that “diversity is our strength” was the “single dumbest phrase in military history.” The defense secretary also moved to end commemorations for Black History Month, Women’s History Month, and more.

On Friday (February 28), Crosland was forced to retire from her military role just a week after President Donald Trump fired the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff and other senior officers, sources told Reuters.

Crosland’s retirement was publicly announced Friday, but Reuters reported that the senior officer was told she must resign.

“I want to thank Crosland for her dedication to the nation, to the military health system, and to Army medicine for the past 32 years,” Stephen Ferrara, acting assistant secretary of defense for health affairs, said in a statement Friday.

The sources, a current and former official, said Crosland wasn’t given a reason why she had to retire. The Pentagon also declined to provide a reason why Crosland allegedly resigned.

Support from the Defense Health Agency and Navy Medicine allowed the hospital to maintain its 24/7 ER service.

Naval Hospital Jacksonville will keep its emergency room running around the clock despite earlier statements that the ER’s schedule would be cut in half, the hospital announced over the weekend.

“Naval Hospital Jacksonville remains committed to providing exceptional care to our patients and ensuring access to the services they rely on,” read a Facebook message the hospital posted Saturday.

The message said the ER was staying open “through the support of the Defense Health Agency and Navy Medicine,” an enterprise created last year that includes the 154-year-old Navy Medical Corps comprised of 4,300 active-duty and reserve physicians. The Defense Health Agency oversees both civilian and military staffs at more than 700 military medical facilities.

The hospital at Naval Air Station Jacksonville had been scheduled to change Monday to ER hours of 6 a.m. to 6 p.m. due to what Capt. Craig Malloy, its commanding officer, last week called “temporary staffing issues.”

The scaled-back hours had been projected to last into the summer.

The group has transformed its MEDIC-X training from a series of task-driven stations to interactive, adrenaline-fueled challenges -- incorporating props, prizes, and, most importantly, high-quality training.
“When you can capture people’s attention during a class or training session, there is a higher likelihood they will retain the information,” explained Air Force Master Sgt.
“The intent is to equip our medics with broad skills common to all medical specialties,” explained Air Force Maj. Gen. Thomas Harrell, director, Defense Health Network Central, and commander, Medical Readiness Command Alpha.
“MEDIC-X will play a critical role as our great nation prepares for Great Power Competition,” said Air Force Col. Maria Bussie, 49 MDG commander.","HOLLOMAN AIR FORCE BASE, New Mexico -- The 49th Medical Group is taking medical readiness training to the next level to enhance military medics’ ability to deliver lifesaving care on the battlefield.

The group has transformed its MEDIC-X training from a series of task-driven stations to interactive, adrenaline-fueled challenges -- incorporating props, prizes, and, most importantly, high-quality training.

“When you can capture people’s attention during a class or training session, there is a higher likelihood they will retain the information,” explained Air Force Master Sgt. Shelby Vande Zande, 49th Healthcare Operations Squadron primary care flight chief and the group’s alternate 4N functional manager. “That was ultimately the goal when setting up the program -- provide quality training and retention of skills.”

The Air Force launched the MEDIC-X program in 2024 to enhance medical Airmen’s ability to provide basic clinical support to warfighters. The program trains medics, including those not involved in patient care, such as administrators or laboratory technicians, to be proficient in 52 lifesaving skills spanning 13 clinical categories.

“The intent is to equip our medics with broad skills common to all medical specialties,” explained Air Force Maj. Gen. Thomas Harrell, director, Defense Health Network Central, and commander, Medical Readiness Command Alpha. “Clinical providers and nurses may be limited on the battlefield; this initiative enhances our ability to deliver safe, high-quality care to our warfighters in any strategic environment.”

Incorporating a mix of classroom and hands-on training, Airmen practice skills such as IV fluid management, oxygen therapy, vital signs, dressing changes, and on- and off-loading patients from fixed-wing aircraft.

Rather than adhere to the traditional training modules and to enhance skills retention, the 49 MDG transformed training into a series of challenges with teams competing to earn the prestigious title of MEDIC-X Module Winner.

“At the inception of the training, we brainstormed the different ways that we could deliver the training that would result in a meaningful outcome while keeping the training interesting,” Vande Zande said.

Capt. Natasha Lindblom, 49 MDG Education and Training Flight commander, said creativity and fun were key to the brainstorming process. “If training is not engaging, it’s more easily forgotten,” she said.

One recent challenge tested Airmen’s ability to feed patients under challenging circumstances. The patient in the scenario wore “drunk glasses” to make their vision blurry, while a teammate fed the patient three spoons of pudding with the aim of not spilling a drop.

“It was great practice for situations where feeding a patient in distress may be needed,” Lindblom explained. “There was certainly a fair amount of pudding spilled.”

Another challenge tested Airmen’s ability to measure a patient’s fluid input and output, which is critical in ensuring fluid imbalance doesn’t impact patients’ stability. Using a chest atrium, foley bag, and syringe for output, as well as a cup of ice, glass of water, and unit of fake blood for input, the team had to measure fluid input and output, correspond the amounts to a number-to-letter chart, then spell out a word that unlocked a lock and revealed a small prize.

“All the while we had volunteers from the line side present yelling and making menacing sounds,” Lindblom said. “The challenge really got their adrenaline going. I was impressed at how many people remembered that 100 ml of ice is equal to 50 ml of fluid.”

“When we are in an austere environment performing these tasks, it will be stressful, and when people are stressed, they may make mistakes,” she added. “Practice is key to performing well under pressure.”

The winning teams receive a small prize, such as a hand-crocheted liver or gallbladder, courtesy of Lindblom. The prizes are small, but participants walk away with a sense of pride and achievement, she said.

The engaging format has received a positive reception, said Senior Airman Claire Pruitt, 49 MDG Education and Training Flight.

“Making MEDIC-X an enjoyable learning experience helps students stay more motivated, absorb the information more effectively, and develop the confidence needed to apply their knowledge in real-world scenarios,” she said. “I love being able to see our hard work make others smile and keep them engaged in an ever-evolving field.”

MEDIC-X is beneficial not only for Airmen, but for the clinical providers on scene, Lindblom noted.

“If I can have non-clinical Airmen measuring inputs and outputs, then nurses can administer medications, hang IVs, do all of the things that nurses need to do,” she said. “Clinical personnel can focus on their tasks and the non-clinical Airmen can take care of the rest, especially when in a situation where prolonged field care is needed.”

Vande Zande said she saw the impact of the MEDIC-X program firsthand during a recent mass casualty exercise. “Our providers, nurses, and medical technicians were overrun with patients, and a lab tech and an admin tech stepped in to assist with providing ventilations and wound treatment to the patients,” she said. “Suddenly, our manpower team was far more than security and patient movement. Having the basic skills necessary to step in during an emergency is invaluable to the team as a whole and does nothing but benefit the patient.”

This collaborative approach strengthens teamwork and ensures Airmen are prepared for the unexpected.

“MEDIC-X will play a critical role as our great nation prepares for Great Power Competition,” said Air Force Col. Maria Bussie, 49 MDG commander. “It enables clinical personnel to take care of casualties without having to worry about dividing their time and energies amongst many. It could be the difference between life and death for one of our warfighters.”

Harrell, one of the architects of the MEDIC-X program, praised the 49 MDG’s creative efforts to enhance medical readiness training.

“In a deployed setting, our medics will be called on to provide potentially lifesaving care and support, and they need to be able to do so confidently and deliberately,” Harrell said. “The 49 MDG’s innovative approach to MEDIC-X is a prime example of how leadership is harnessing ingenuity to ensure medical readiness and the delivery of exceptional care to our warfighters in any combat setting, no matter how austere or remote.”",https://d1ldvf68ux039x.cloudfront.net/thumbs/photos/2503/8905127/1000w_q95.jpg,N,1.0,2025-03-09 18:50:22.370749

The simulator, designed to replicate real-life neonatal resuscitation scenarios, enables healthcare providers to practice essential techniques, such as positive pressure ventilation, with real-time feedback.","On February 12, 2025, the U.S. Navy Medicine Readiness and Training Command (NMRTC) / Naval Hospital (NH) Sigonella celebrated the acquisition of the Resuscitation Quality Improvement (RQI) simulator for the Neonatal Resuscitation Program (NRP). The addition of this advanced training tool underscores the hospital’s commitment to improving neonatal care and aligns with ongoing efforts by Navy Medicine and the Defense Health Agency (DHA) to enhance medical readiness and patient outcomes. Mrs. Katia Arico, the command’s Staff Education and Training Coordinator and Trainer, led the year-long planning and procurement of the RQI for NRP Skills Station.

Hospital staff from across departments gathered for a lively celebration, themed as a baby shower, to mark the arrival of the innovative simulator. The event featured a range of activities, including games and prizes, with the staff actively participating in a poll to name the new neonatal manikin. The winning name, NOAH—an acronym for Neonatal Outcomes And Healthcare—was chosen as a symbol of the hospital’s dedication to improving neonatal care through cutting-edge training technology.

The new RQI simulator offers significant value to the hospital’s training program by helping healthcare providers maintain and improve their neonatal resuscitation skills. With NRP renewal training required every two years, the gap between training sessions can often lead to skill degradation. The use of simulation provides an effective solution to this challenge, enabling clinicians to repeatedly practice critical skills, sustain knowledge, and maintain proficiency.

The simulator, designed to replicate real-life neonatal resuscitation scenarios, enables healthcare providers to practice essential techniques, such as positive pressure ventilation, with real-time feedback. Key metrics, including mask seal, ventilation rate, and pressure, are monitored to guide improvements in clinical performance. The staff will utilize the simulator on a quarterly basis to practice the skills required to get newborn babies breathing in the critical first minutes after birth.

U.S. NMRTC/ NH Sigonella ensures maximum readiness by providing high-quality, safe patient and family-centered care to NATO and transient DoD forces in the U.S. Fifth Fleet and U.S. Sixth Fleet areas of operation and delivers an average of 50 babies per year. While the volume may be lower than larger hospitals, the importance of maintaining proficiency in high-risk neonatal scenarios remains paramount. The hospital’s healthcare professionals are called to manage neonatal resuscitations, which demand not only advanced knowledge but also immediate, precise action. “Our team is exceptional in providing care, but we know that high-risk scenarios, while rare, can be life-altering when they occur,” said Cmdr. (Dr.) Sebastian Lara, the sole Pediatrician at the hospital. “That’s why RQI for NRP is so important. It allows our staff to stay current with the latest neonatal resuscitation techniques and ensures that we are ready to respond effectively when it matters most.”

This initiative aligns with the Navy Surgeon General’s call for healthcare teams to remain agile and competent in a broad spectrum of clinical situations, even in low-volume settings. Lt. Cmdr. Brandi Gibson, the command’s NRP Program Director, shared her thoughts on the new system. “With such a low delivery volume, it’s easy to feel out of practice when we encounter a complicated birth. RQI has given our staff the ability to practice the most important neonatal resuscitation skills regularly, so when we do face a difficult situation, we are confident and ready to act.”

The hospital’s commitment to safety and readiness also aligns with the Navy’s broader mission of providing comprehensive healthcare services to military personnel and their families, no matter where they are stationed. In an environment where resources are sometimes limited and the stakes are high, maintaining a culture of excellence is essential. As Cmdr. Lara concluded, “We may not face a high volume of complicated deliveries, but when they do occur, we want to be ready. RQI for NRP ensures that we have the skills and knowledge to provide the best care possible and live up to the trust our patients place in us every day.”

The successful launch of the RQI for NRP program at U.S. NMRTC/NH Sigonella is a testament to the dedication of military medical personnel in upholding the highest standards of care, readiness, and patient safety. Through this initiative, the hospital continues to foster a culture of continuous improvement while ensuring that its staff is prepared for the most challenging and critical situations, both in peacetime and in the line of duty.",https://d1ldvf68ux039x.cloudfront.net/thumbs/photos/2503/8904905/1000w_q95.jpg,N,0.0,2025-03-09 12:50:26.028265

Not only under the “well-child” criteria, but that’s these type of appointments fall under the category of preventative appts.
After getting in touch with the physician office I was told they couldn’t change it, and that I needed to speak to either billing or tricare.
After speaking with tricare they agreed with my train of thought but wanted to transfer me to their claims department.
Somebody, for the love of god.. please point me in the right direction for how I can resolve this.","Recently PCSd out west transferring over to tricare west. For my 2 kids that are in the 0-6 years old “well-child” criteria of tricare I assumed that all routine check ups for IE) 6mo 12mo, etc. check ups would be fully covered. Not only under the “well-child” criteria, but that’s these type of appointments fall under the category of preventative appts. Several weeks after the appointments both on the same day for both children; we were sent a bill in the mail for the appointment that needed to be paid. I was sent through the witch-hunt. After calling the clinic they transferred me to the billing department multiple times where they said the appointment was mis-coded by the physician and should’ve been coded as a preventative and that I could only change it by speaking with the physician for them to do an amendment to the visit to recode. After getting in touch with the physician office I was told they couldn’t change it, and that I needed to speak to either billing or tricare. Talking to someone different in billing a 3rd/4th time I was told that the EOB for coverage covered the visit but not “technical fee” also known as a facility fee. After speaking with tricare they agreed with my train of thought but wanted to transfer me to their claims department. After 4 attempts of getting in touch their claims department, being on hold for over an hour each time and requesting a call back I was unsuccessful in ever getting in touch with the claims department. Seems impossible. It is my perception that on tricare select with my kids being under 6yo doing routine “preventative” checkups, as well as “well-child” that I shouldn’t be paying anything out of pocket for these appointments. So now I’m sitting here with a $240 bill for a single checkup, many more appointments to come for them as they hit milestones of routine checkups for under 1yo. In search of any way to resolve this or what my next actions should be to fix this issue. I’m an active duty service member, have been in for quite a while, I’m on my 6th duty station and chose to pay a little extra for my beneficiaries to be on select so they wouldn’t have to deal with lack of competence and extreme levels of unprofessionalism we’ve experienced on post time and time again. It seems absurd to me that me as customer has to call numerous times from office to office for them to just tell me that it’s a different person that’s responsible for the billing mistakes. Somebody, for the love of god.. please point me in the right direction for how I can resolve this. Thank you for your time.",,N,-1.0,2025-03-08 23:50:32.782748

What makes where you live feel like home? It’s not just bricks and mortar – it’s the warmth, the welcome, and the people who make you feel you belong. In our Retirement Living Communities, it’s often the wonderful women on our teams who transform spaces into true communities where residents don’t just live – they flourish.

At TriCare, we see first-hand how our female Village Managers and support staff bring something special to our Retirement Communities. They’re natural connectors, brilliant listeners, and champions of independence who understand that retirement should be about enjoying life to the fullest. This International Women’s Day, we’re celebrating these incredible women who create environments where residents feel both supported and empowered.

Creating connection in every interaction

Speak into any of our Retirement Communities residents and they will tell you it is all about the ‘vibe’, and you’ll likely find a female team member having a friendly chat with residents in a, remembering to ask about someone’s garden after the recent rain, or asking about grandchildren by name. These seemingly small moments are actually the building blocks of community – creating spaces where everyone feels seen and valued.

Our Village Managers and staff have a natural talent for fostering these connections, whether they’re welcoming new residents with a personal touch or remembering significant anniversaries. They understand that genuine relationships are at the heart of happy retirement living, and they nurture these connections every day with authentic care and interest.

Champions of vibrant community life

“Have you heard about the bus trip next Tuesday?”

“There’s a new face at morning tea – let me introduce you!”

“We haven’t seen you for a while. Are you okay?”

The women on our teams are often the cheerful voices encouraging participation and making sure everyone feels cared for.

From coordinating day trips that create shared memories to supporting resident-led committees and interest groups, the women in our team and communities play a crucial role in keeping community calendars full of opportunities for connection. They strike that perfect balance – providing just enough support while empowering residents to take ownership of their community activities.

They’re also brilliant at spotting when someone might be feeling a bit isolated and finding gentle ways to help them reconnect. That might mean sitting for a cuppa with a resident who’s been quiet lately or suggesting activities that match someone’s interests. It’s this thoughtful approach that helps maintain the social fabric of our communities.

Creating spaces that feel like home

There’s something special about the way women in our Retirement Communities approach their work and village – they don’t just manage spaces; they nurture environments where people feel they truly belong.

Our female team members often bring those homely touches that make all the difference – fresh flowers in the community centre, remembering dietary preferences without being asked, or creating seasonal decorations that make communal areas feel festive and inviting. They understand that independence doesn’t mean doing everything alone – it means having the right support, exactly when you need it.

The perfect blend of professional and personal

What makes our women in Retirement Communities so valued is their ability to be both professionally capable and personally warm. They’re experts at navigating administrative requirements and community management while never losing sight of the human element.

They know when to step in with support and when to step back to allow independence. They celebrate residents’ independence while providing reassurance that help is there if needed. It’s this delicate balance that allows our Retirement Living Communities to feel both secure and freeing – places where residents can truly enjoy their retirement years with confidence.

This International Women’s Day, we’re raising a glass to the women who create the heart of our Retirement Communities as well as the men who support us in gender equality- the connectors, the supporters, and the champions of joyful, independent living.

I fear it's only going to get worse.

It’s kinda awful. Last year tried to change my pcm and I had to call soo many offices. A couple said they’ve had to call so many times over two years to get their info removed and they’re still dealing with it.

My favorite part was Tricare sent me a letter changing my pcm (to one who wasn’t practicing at that location anymore) because my current was no longer with Tricare. I go on the Tricare website to find a new pcm to only see the pcm they pulled me off of listed as a provider.

Well, since they haven’t paid any claims since they took over I will leave the assumption up to you.

With the delays in payments maybe providers are going to stop taking tricare at all. I can’t blame them. If you want anything to happen contact the news and your congressmen. I made a gpt so you don’t even have to think about how to write. #tricarewestfail

TRICARE is a government-run insurance provider that serves millions of military families and veterans across the country. As of January 1, 2025, TriWest became the new provider network for the Western Region, comprised of 26 states, including Colorado, overseeing 4.3 million eligible TRICARE beneficiaries.

Since the New Year, Licensed Clinical Social Workers like Tawnia Valdez, who operates a private practice in Old Colorado City. As a 20-year Army veteran herself, she works mostly with fellow veterans and military families.

""I feel like it's a culture and an area that I enjoy working with,"" explained Valdez.

She believed that everything was going to carry on as normal once January 1st arrived, but instead, she says the rollout of TriWest was done without any concrete communication.

""As of today, I still haven't had any formal message or statement or anything from the previous TRICARE or TriWest, which is now in service. It's all really word of mouth and how to go about things,"" explained Valdez.

Now, with the first week of March completed, she says that she hasn't been paid for upwards of 50 claims that she has filed for sessions she has provided for her clients, and the unpaid claims have begun to pile up.

""My claims are going through. They're just in a hold status. I haven't been paid for any TRICARE clients,"" she said.

Valdez says the backlog has forced her and other colleagues in the therapy space to even put TRICARE clients on hold until further notice.

""The problem they were running into is trying to find a referral source within this community. First off, people are hesitant to take more TRICARE clients, and they may not be fully credentialed to be able to take TRICARE claims,"" she explained, adding that many LCSWs and therapists are unsure if they're even licensed to be working with TRICARE as of April 1, 2025, since communication has been lacking.

""The idea was that for the first 90 days, we would all still be able to file claims, but after that we still some of us [that] have no status of if we're credentialed with this new TRICARE, or what our status is."" she said.

Valdez says colleagues in Colorado are also running into financial challenges at their own practices, due to the unpaid claims.

""Some therapists are needing to obtain other sources of income because they just can't have that many holds or they're not being paid,"" said Valdez.

TriWest sent this statement to KRDO13 on Friday:

""“TriWest is honored to partner with the Department of Defense to administer the TRICARE program in 26 western states. All major health care transitions of this size and scale bring challenges and we are working tirelessly seven days a week to implement solutions because there is nothing more important than ensuring military families get the care they earned. In collaboration with our partners, we are making progress every day as we deliver access to care for 4.3 million eligible beneficiaries in the West Region.”

“They were escorted out to where there were security cars, and a line of security guards were standing with arms folded,” the AFGE told Federal News Network.
While those probationary employees were told that their termination letters would be sent out to them, they were also informed that they were being placed on administrative leave until the official termination date at the end of March.
At the same time, a different Navy organization is preparing for layoffs, but no probationary employees have been placed on leave so far.
The Defense Department initially postponed the terminations of its probationary employees to assess national security and readiness implications of the firings.","The Defense Department has started placing probationary employees on administrative leave while they are awaiting official action by their organizations or until their termination takes effect.

According to the American Federation of Government Employees (AFGE) local, approximately 20 civilian probationary employees at the Defense Health Agency were summoned to a conference room at the agency’s headquarters in Falls Church, Virginia, where they were informed that they were being terminated. They were told to hand over their ID cards and laptops before being walked out of the building.

“They were escorted out to where there were security cars, and a line of security guards were standing with arms folded,” the AFGE told Federal News Network.

While those probationary employees were told that their termination letters would be sent out to them, they were also informed that they were being placed on administrative leave until the official termination date at the end of March.

The Defense Health Agency didn’t provide the exact number of employees fired so far, but the agency told Federal News Network that dismissals have been limited to headquarters positions “that are administrative in nature.”

In a memo signed by Acting Assistant Secretary of Defense for Health Affairs Stephen Ferrara that was sent to the fired DHA employees, the agency cited the Office of Personnel Management (OPM) guidance stating that “an appointment is not final until the probationary period is over” and that “until the probationary period has been completed, a probationer has the burden to demonstrate why it is in the public interest for the government to finalize an appointment to the civil service for this particular individual.”

The memo added that OPM has “emphasized that individual employee performance measurement should be aligned with and support organizational goals and focus employee efforts on achieving organizational and group goals” and that OPM has directed agencies to “consider whether an employee’s performance is in the best interest of the government.”

“Based on the OPM guidance referenced above, the agency finds, based on your performance, that you have not demonstrated that your further employment at the agency would be in the public interest,” the memo sent out to the fired DHA workers reads.

While the termination notice cited employees’ failure to meet performance standards, one DHA probationary employee who was among those laid off this week told Federal News Network that he had received a good first review and had strong references from both his immediate supervisor and a senior official in the organization. He is now appealing his termination through the Merit Systems Protection Board (MSPB), the U.S. Office of Special Counsel (OSC), and his local representative.

Meanwhile, one Navy civilian employee who is a retired officer with more than two decades of service told Federal News Network he was placed on administrative leave for three weeks but no further guidance has been provided ever since he turned in his computer and was escorted out of the building on Tuesday.

“I don’t even have good guidance. [Human Resources] told me they don’t have anything to give me and that I’m on admin leave. The HR is reactive, and because this has never been done before, they’re scrambling,” he said.

At the same time, a different Navy organization is preparing for layoffs, but no probationary employees have been placed on leave so far.

Last month, the office of the secretary of defense said the department was preparing to reduce its civilian workforce by 5-8%, and announced that approximately 5,400 probationary employees would be laid off. The Defense Department initially postponed the terminations of its probationary employees to assess national security and readiness implications of the firings.

Veteran groups seek volunteers

The Nevada Veterans Coalition, the Patriot Guard Riders and the Northern Nevada All Veteran Honor Guard are seeking new members. The coalition assists with military funerals at the Northern Nevada Veterans Memorial Cemetery and presents the colors at events such as Memorial Day in late May, the Vietnam Veterans Remembrance ceremony in March, and the Camos to Classroom scholarship dinner in mid-November.

Coalition members aren’t required to be veterans, but they should support the military. For information, call 775-575-6842 or email info@supportnnvc.org.

Patriot Guard Riders complement the honor guards and their tributes to fallen comrades. Founded in 2005, the group honors military veterans and first responders. The Patriot Guard Riders encourage anyone who has a love and respect for veterans and first responders to join. Many members ride motorcycles as escorts for funerals and other events, but that is not a requirement for joining.

Since Patriot Guard Riders is a national organization, volunteers may sign up at patriotguard.org. Membership is free. The Northern Nevada All Veteran Honor Guard is sponsored by Carson City’s American Legion High Desert Post 56. The nonprofit honor guard presides at services at no cost to the family. Qualifications for membership include military service and availability on weekdays. The group does not provide services on Sundays.

Potential members interested in joining the honor guard or observing a service can contact Guard Commander Jim Jackson at 775-443-8507. The honor guard provides funeral, memorial and commemorative services throughout northern Nevada, Lake Tahoe, Truckee and other areas by request. Family members may ask funeral homes to contact the honor guard directly.

Veterans make up about 30% of the federal workforce but comprise nearly half of the Defense Department’s civilian workforce.","WASHINGTON — Civilians working for the Navy and the Defense Department’s health and logistics agencies were the first to lose their jobs as the Pentagon began firing workers this week.

The Navy, the Defense Health Agency and the Defense Logistics Agency confirmed civilian job terminations are underway at those organizations, though information on those firings was limited Friday. The firings are part of a Defense Department-wide effort to reduce the civilian workforce by up to 8%, beginning with 5,400 probationary workers. Those layoffs began Monday, according to a memo released by the Pentagon that was dated the same day.

The Navy does not have the number of civilian personnel fired “readily available for public release,” said Cmdr. Tim Hawkins, the Navy’s assistant chief of information, media operations, production and plans. “The process is in progress. We will look to provide additional information when able.”

The Defense Health Agency also was unable to say how many probationary workers had been fired, though an official with the agency said, “To date, DHA dismissals are restricted to headquarters positions that are administrative in nature.”

The Defense Logistics Agency confirmed Thursday that fewer than 100 civilian personnel of its workforce of 25,000 were dismissed Monday from their jobs.

The civilian workers fired were probationary, officials confirmed. The federal government considers workers to be probationary if they have been on the job for less than one to two years. Probationary workers lack the employment protections of more seasoned workers.

“DLA released probationary employees consistent with the Department of Defense’s broader efforts to ensure resources are aligned with the department’s strategic objectives,” the agency said in a statement.

The Defense Logistics Agency provides logistics support to the military and foreign nations. It is the Defense Department’s largest combat support agency. The agency declined to identify the divisions where the dismissed employees worked or whether more terminations are expected.

Workers fired Monday were “the first step” in the Defense Department’s effort to “appropriately align its personnel resources with its critical war-fighting functions,” read the March 3 memo signed by Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth. Their employment, he said, was not in the public interest.

“The department will continue taking steps to implement [President Donald Trump’s] direction to restore accountability to the American public, reduce the size of the federal government’s workforce through efficiency improvements and attrition, and faithfully and responsibly manage taxpayer dollars,” the memo reads.

The firings were planned to start last week. Multiple Pentagon officials were unable to provide a reason for the delay.

The firings will come in waves until officials dismiss the 5,400 workers required by Hegseth, a defense official who spoke on the condition of anonymity said Thursday. The official was unable to say how many layoffs had already occurred or what departments were impacted.

On the same day that the firings began, Rep. Jen Kiggans, R-Va., a Navy veteran, sent a letter to Hegseth urging him to mitigate workforce reductions at the Defense Department. Kiggans expressed concern about how cutting civilian staff with prior military service could impact national security.

“At a time when we are seeing global instability and rising threats from adversaries like China and Russia, it is vital that we protect our skilled workforce and focus on maintaining a robust and capable Department of Defense,” she wrote.

Kiggans urged Hegseth to ensure veterans are not disproportionately affected by layoffs.

“Their unique skills and dedication are critical to maintaining the strength of our military,” she wrote.

Veterans make up about 30% of the federal workforce but comprise nearly half of the Defense Department’s civilian workforce. There are more than 950,000 civilian employees across the Defense Department, according to its civilian careers website.

Democratic lawmakers warned last week the Defense Department is preparing to fire more than 70,000 civilians across its workforce. That would be within the 5% to 8% proposed cut outlined two weeks ago by Hegseth.

“This will inevitably impact defense readiness,” said Sen. Richard Blumenthal, D-Conn. “There’s a domino effect that will extend across the military. People get demoralized and disillusioned. Costs go well beyond dollars and cents.”

Other lawmakers are focused on minimizing impacts to areas of the Defense Department that they consider to be critical, including shipyards, logistics, equipment maintenance, aircraft repair and information security.

In early February, more than a month before Hegseth announced sweeping layoffs, Sens. Jeanne Shaheen, D-N.H., and Susan Collins, R-Maine, wrote a letter to the acting Navy secretary asking for exemptions to the service’s public shipyard workforce in the event of layoffs.

“Our shipyards cannot afford to reduce their workforces. In fact, [Portsmouth Naval Shipyard in Maine] needs to hire 550 workers annually just to meet Navy demand for the foreseeable future,” the senators wrote.

The Navy has four public shipyards — Norfolk Naval Shipyard in Virginia, Portsmouth Naval Shipyard in Maine, Puget Sound Naval Shipyard and Intermediate Maintenance Facility in Washington, and Pearl Harbor Naval Shipyard and Intermediate Maintenance Facility in Hawaii — that serve as maintenance depots for nuclear-powered submarines and aircraft carriers.

The four shipyards have a combined civilian workforce of more than 30,000 people. But lawmakers have argued the backlog of ships in maintenance in the past decade is, in part, due to a need for more workers.

The Navy wrote last week in a letter to the lawmakers that it was working with the Defense Department to identify critical functions and positions at naval shipyards for exemption. The letter was signed Feb. 28 by acting Navy Secretary Terence Emmert.

“The [Navy] is committed to carry out workforce shaping in a manner that preserves lethality and readiness, while advancing the administration’s imperatives of reduction and cost savings,” according to the letter.",,N,,2025-03-07 13:17:18.757503

In February they delivered more than 4,200 scheduled virtual visits.

“People engage in our care system not so that they can get an appointment, but so that they can have their needs met,” said Lt. Col. Evan Trivette, chief of Family Medicine and commander for Primary Care Services. “With the My Military Health, we aim to provide the right level and mode of care at the right time.”

Patients can now access medical care from anywhere, providing they have internet access, reducing the need for in-person visits and minimizing disruptions to their daily routines.

“We're able to take care of a lot of issues right when the Soldier needs it, opposed to waiting for them to come in for an actual appointment,” said Capt. Timothy Karnuth, physician assistant 82nd Airborne Division “What that means is that we have a shorter wait for an appointment, and open appointments to see the people who actually need to come in for physical exams or for musculoskeletal conditions.”

Scheduled virtual visits increase the provider scheduling flexibility and leverages new technology.

“As a provider, I find the system easy to navigate to create provider generated visits,” said Dr. Omici Uwagbai, Family Medicine Physician, Robinson Health Clinic. Just a few clicks of the mouse and I can send patients a link for a virtual visit.”

The virtual healthcare platform enables seamless communication between healthcare providers, ensuring that patients receive comprehensive and coordinated care. It’s a tool for patients to be more active in their healthcare and it’s not locked into a 20-minute face-to-face appointments. Patients can schedule a virtual appointment at any time and attend the scheduled virtual video appointment by phone, tablet or computer.

Efficiency is how one patient described My Military Health after a recent appointment.

“I had some labs drawn,” said patient and retired Col. Roy Vernon. “I needed to talk about those labs as opposed to making an appointment with my provider. I got on to the MHS Genesis Patient Portal and asked questions. “I got a phone call from the nurse who went into detail on every point, and she let me know, nothing to be concerned about. So instead of me having to make an appointment, sit down with a provider and take time out of my day, I was able to do it all from my truck, and I think that's efficiency.”

So far, the medical facility has noticed a 75% reduction in wait times through virtual appointments, increased access to care for remote or deployed personnel and an improved patient satisfaction rating of 25%.

Teens who sleep less may have higher blood pressure

Teenagers who sleep less than 7.7 hours per night may face a significantly higher risk of developing high blood pressure, according to preliminary research presented at the American Heart Association’s 2025 scientific sessions. The study found that teens with insomnia and insufficient sleep were five times more likely to develop stage 2 hypertension compared to well-rested peers. However, those who reported insomnia but slept at least 7.7 hours did not show increased risk. Researchers emphasize the importance of sleep monitoring in adolescents to prevent long-term cardiovascular issues.

Patient Safety Awareness Week DHA facilities will raise awareness about patient safety throughout March.","MARCH 7, 2025 – Do you get health care at a military hospital or clinic? When you need care, patient safety should never be a concern. You deserve to know how well your military hospital or clinic protects you and your family from preventable harm.

Military hospitals consistently earn top safety ratings. It’s easy to view these scores yourself.

Last year, 15 military hospitals earned “A” grades from the Leapfrog Group. This means that 75% of participating Defense Health Agency hospitals earned top grades. This is far above the national average of 32%.

Some DHA hospitals didn’t see enough patients to qualify for Leapfrog grades last year. But DHA has strict safety standards at all military hospitals and clinics.

“Our military hospitals rank among the nation’s safest,” said Heidi King, chief of DHA’s Patient Safety Program. “Our healthcare teams work every day to protect patients from preventable harm and deliver excellent care.”

What is Leapfrog?

The Leapfrog Group is a national, independent organization focused on healthcare quality. Leapfrog uses up to 30 safety measures to grade hospitals. These measures include:

Infection prevention

Staffing

Errors

Injuries

Home care instructions

These military hospitals earned “A” grades in fall 2024.

81st Medical Group, Keesler Air Force Base, Mississippi

673rd Medical Group, Joint Base Elmendorf-Richardson, Alaska

Walter Reed National Military Medical Center, Bethesda, Maryland

William Beaumont Army Medical Center, Fort Bliss, Texas

Womack Army Medical Center, Fort Bragg, North Carolina

Wright-Patterson Medical Center, Wright-Patterson Air Force Base, Ohio

DHA started working with Leapfrog to check hospital quality five years ago. It became the first federal health system to participate in the safety grade program. DHA expanded the program after success at Walter Reed.

How does the DHA work to keep you safe?

DHA has several programs to keep you safe. These programs include:

Ready Reliable Care Safety Communication Bundle: Since 2022, all military hospitals have used the same safety communication tools. This means staff across military hospitals all follow the same safety steps. This bundle also makes it easier for staff to report concerns.

Joint Patient Safety Reporting: DHA wants to know about all patient safety events. This includes “near misses.” Reporting these concerns helps staff review and address them quickly.

These programs and others work together to create safer care for you at military hospitals and clinics.

Want to check your military hospital’s safety record?

There are several ways to learn about your military hospital’s safety? Visit Health.mil’s Quality, Patient Safety, and Access Information page to see:

Safety measures

Patient safety outside military hospitals and clinics

Do you have Medicare and TRICARE For Life coverage? You can check the safety ratings of your Medicare providers. You can use the Medicare Care Compare tool to compare Medicare providers and facilities by:

Overall star ratings

Patient experiences

Complications and safety events

Remember: Your engagement is key to building relationships with your providers. It also leads to safer care.

Patient Safety Awareness Week

DHA facilities will raise awareness about patient safety throughout March. The official Patient Safety Awareness Week is March 9–15.

This year’s theme is “Patient Safety is a Team Sport.” This theme highlights how patients are essential members of the care team. It also showcases and recognizes military hospitals and clinics for their commitment to patient safety.

Building relationships with your providers helps foster safer care. Be sure to tell your provider if you have any safety concerns while getting care.

Army Medicine, represented by Lt. Gen. R. Scott Dingle, U.S. Army Surgeon General and Commanding General, United States Army Medical Command, spoke at the AUSA Military Family Forum III: Quality of Life – Healthcare and Spouse Employment.

The moderator of the healthcare section of the panel was Dr. Brian C. Lein, Assistant Director, Healthcare Administration, Defense Health Agency. Panelists included Lt. Gen. Telita Crosland, Director, Defense Health Agency; Brig. Gen. Mary V. Krueger, Special Assistant to the Director of the Army Staff and 24th Chief, US Army Medical Corps; and Jessica R. Slaughter, Health Systems Specialist, TRICARE Benefits, Exceptional Family Member Program, Prevention, Resilience, and Readiness Directorate, Office of the Deputy Chief of Staff, G-9, United States Army

Dingle thanked AUSA for setting up the family forums and those who worked as ambassadors and advocates for the military family as well. “The impact that you have made and going to make is tremendous” as you work tirelessly on behalf of Army Families, he said.

Dingle paraphrased the late Gen. Raymond Odierno and said the strength of the nation is the Army, the strength of the Army is the Soldier, and the strength of the Soldier is the Family. Dingle said that 7 years ago there were many unanswered questions for the Army Family, and they faced many challenges. Over the past 7 years, “the Army senior leadership has built a synergistic team between AUSA, between our Families, Soldiers, and those who are supporting our Families,” he said.

Today, the team that is “answering the call to address the many challenges” our families face, Dingle said.

Topics the panel discussed include the importance of graduate medical education, access to care, Tricare, staffing, Shortage of nursing, keeping Families healthy, and the role of Guard and Reserve as part of the health care system.

Additional discussion covered the Exceptional Family Member Program—a program that works with other military and civilian agencies to provide comprehensive and coordinated community support, housing, educational, medical, and personnel services to Families with special needs.

The goal is to take care of the family so the Soldier can take care of the mission.

“Army Medicine remains committed to your care and the care of your family,” said Krueger.",,N,,2025-03-07 13:18:11.548270

What People Are Saying Acting U.S. Attorney Brook B. Andrews for the District of South Carolina, said: ""Integrity must be the standard in our health care system.
Our commitment is to safeguard taxpayer-funded health care and the patients who rely on it, and we will rigorously pursue any allegations of False Claims Act violations.""","A number of doctors and medical practices have agreed to pay $1.9 million to settle allegations of fraudulent claims to Medicare and TRICARE, the U.S. Department of Justice announced Thursday.

Newsweek has contacted Curis Healthcare Inc and Alliance Immediate and Primary Care of Chicago out of hours via email for comment.

Why It Matters

Medicare and Medicaid have come into the spotlight in recent weeks as President Donald Trump's Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) investigates the health programs' spending to uncover ""fraud, waste and abuse"" in the systems.

A Government Accountability Office (GAO) report from 2024 found that $100 billion had been discovered in ""improper payments"" in 2023 across the Medicare and Medicaid programs. However, the claims that the federal health programs are full of ""waste"" and ""fraud"" have been disputed by others.

What To Know

The U.S. Department of Justice shared that those involved have agreed to pay a total of $1,913,808 to resolve alleged ""False Claims Act violations arising from their involvement in laboratory kickback schemes.""

Those involved include the doctors Gerald Congdon, M.D., of Pawleys Island, South Carolina, Gbenga Aluko, M.D., of Charlotte, North Carolina, Anup Banerjee, M.D., of Gastonia, North Carolina, and their medical practices, and Omar Hussain, of South Miami, Florida.

It also includes the health care providers Curis Healthcare Inc, of Chicago, Illinois, and Saeed Medical Group Ltd, which is doing business as Alliance Immediate and Primary Care, of Chicago, Illinois.

According to the U.S. Department of Justice, the Anti-Kickback Statute prohibits offering, paying, soliciting, or receiving remuneration to induce referrals of items or services covered by Medicare, TRICARE, the federal health program for those in the U.S. military, and other federally funded health care programs.

The statute is designed to ensure that medical providers' judgments are not driven by improper financial incentives and instead focused solely on the best interests of their patients.

The settlements resolve allegations that health care providers received kickbacks in return for their referrals to a laboratory in Anderson, South Carolina. A marketer, along with his company, is also involved in the allegations.

The kickbacks allegedly resulted in the submission of ""false or fraudulent laboratory testing claims to Medicare and TRICARE in violation of the False Claims Act,"" the Department of Justice stated.

The Details

A press release from the Office of Public Affairs listed the following as resolved:

Dr. Gerald Congdon, Coastal Urgent Care LLC, and Coastal Wellness Center LLC. Dr. Congdon and his medical practices in Pawleys Island and Myrtle Beach, South Carolina, agreed to pay $400,000 to resolve allegations that from May 2016 to November 2021, they received thousands of dollars in remuneration disguised as purported office space rental and phlebotomy payments from the South Carolina laboratory in return for ordering testing.

Dr. Gbenga Aluko and Eagle Medical Center PC. Dr. Aluko and his medical practice in Charlotte, North Carolina, agreed to pay $250,000 to resolve allegations that from May 2016 to November 2021, they received thousands of dollars in remuneration disguised as purported office space rental, phlebotomy, and toxicology payments from the South Carolina laboratory in return for ordering testing.

Dr. Anup Banerjee and Gastonia Medical Specialty Clinic P.A. Dr. Banerjee and his medical practice in Gastonia, North Carolina, agreed to pay $206,000 to resolve allegations that from April 2017 to November 2021, they received thousands of dollars in remuneration disguised as purported office space rental and phlebotomy payments from the South Carolina laboratory in return for ordering testing.

Omar Hussain and Curis Healthcare Inc. Hussain and his marketing company agreed to pay $817,808 to resolve allegations that from April 2020 to August 2021, Hussain and his company received commissions from the South Carolina laboratory as independent contractors based on the volume and value of the Medicare and TRICARE referrals for laboratory testing that they arranged for and recommended.

Saeed Medical Group Ltd., Omar Hussain, and Curis Healthcare Inc. Saeed Medical Group and Hussain and his marketing company agreed to pay $240,000 to resolve allegations that from April 2020 to August 2021, Saeed Medical Group received thousands of dollars in remuneration in the form of cash payments from Hussain and his company in return for ordering testing from the South Carolina laboratory.

The department noted that the claims resolved by the settlements are only allegations, and there has been no determination of liability.

Newsweek phoned Coastal Urgent Care, the practice of Gerald Congdon, Eagle Medical Center, the practice of Gbenga Aluko, Gastonia Medical Specialty Clinic, the practice of Anup Banerjee, and Keralty Hospital Miami, the practice of Omar Hussain, for comment but was unable to get through to an operator.

What People Are Saying

Acting U.S. Attorney Brook B. Andrews for the District of South Carolina, said: ""Integrity must be the standard in our health care system. Kickback schemes divert funds and focus away from patients and their medical needs.""

Special Agent in Charge Steve Jensen of the FBI Columbia Field Office, said: ""The public puts immense trust in medical professionals, and disdain for the rule of law damages that trust and erodes their credibility. These settlements should serve as a reminder that the FBI and its partners are committed to holding medical practitioners accountable for kickbacks.""

Special Agent in Charge Kelly Blackmon of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services Office of Inspector General (HHS-OIG), said: ""Kickback schemes undermine medical decision-making and jeopardize the integrity of federally funded health care programs. Our commitment is to safeguard taxpayer-funded health care and the patients who rely on it, and we will rigorously pursue any allegations of False Claims Act violations.""

Special Agent in Charge Christopher Dillard of the Department of Defense Office of Inspector General, Defense Criminal Investigative Service (DCIS) mid-Atlantic Field Office, said: ""The trust of the American taxpayer and the well-being of our service members are undermined when laboratories and physicians engage in collusive financial relationships. DCIS will continue to work with our law enforcement partners to bring to justice medical providers who illegally enrich themselves by prioritizing kickbacks over patient care.""

What's Next

The Department of Justice emphasized that the pursuit of uncovering fraud in Medicare and TRICARE illustrates the government's goal of ""combating health care fraud,"" and added that ""one of the most powerful tools"" in this effort was the False Claims Act.

It seems likely that the government will continue to push the effort to uncover ""fraud"" in federal health programs, something which DOGE's Subcommittee on Delivering on Government Efficiency has pledged to do.",,N,,2025-03-07 13:18:26.102833
