This adjustment follows SiTime’s launch of its Titan Platform, which positions the company uniquely in the $4 billion resonator market.

""The demands of military life can create unique stressors for the children of service members, increasing their vulnerability to depression and other mental health challenges,” said Geoffrey Grammer, MD, Chief Medical Officer of Neuronetics and retired U.S. Army Colonel. “By expanding coverage to include NeuroStar TMS, TriWest is taking a meaningful step toward ensuring that the sons and daughters of our active-duty and retired military heroes receive the care and support that honors their families’ service to our nation.""

An estimated 4.3 million U.S. adolescents aged 15-21 are affected by major depression.1 Depression amongst adolescents can disrupt crucial aspects of development, such as academic performance, relationships with peers and family members, and overall emotional well-being. With limited approved medication options for adolescents with MDD, NeuroStar is a safe and effective option that can be used as a first-line, add-on treatment with remarkable clinical outcomes. As a first-line treatment, NeuroStar can be used without prior medication failures in this age group. Since receiving FDA clearance for adolescent patients in 2024, NeuroStar TMS therapy is also now covered by several leading insurers, including but not limited to: Evernorth Health Services (a Cigna company), BlueCross BlueShield Health Care Service Corporation (BCBS-HCSC), Humana, Aetna, Medi-Cal, Pacific Source, and more.

In addition to being the first TMS company with FDA clearance for adolescent treatment, Neuronetics is the only TMS company in the industry with a dedicated health policy team that partners with both providers and payors to advocate for health policy updates.

Military families in Atlanta and Tampa will see something different during the 2025 TRICARE Open Season: a new choice in how they receive care.

Through the Department of Defense’s Competitive Plans Demonstration (CPD), eligible families can enroll in TRICARE Prime Demo by CareSource Military & Veterans (CSMV), a health plan designed to meet the realities of military life with more local support.

TRICARE remains a critical part of military readiness, and this system is continuing to evolve. Roving choice ensures families have access, continuity, and the kind of support that fits their lives.

According to the Blue Star Families 2023 Military Family Lifestyle Survey, 35 percent of active duty family respondents live in communities with a shortage of both military and civilian mental health professionals. These gaps can delay care when families need it most, and the stress shows in every area of life, from parenting to readiness.

Military families move the mission. They adapt, restart, and keep the home front running so their loved ones can serve. In health care, as in service, demands evolve quickly. While TRICARE continues to support millions of families, military life today requires new approaches to access, continuity, and support. That is why the Department of Defense launched the Competitive Plans Demonstration to explore options that better reflect the pace and complexity of modern military service.

This is something I understand not just professionally but personally. As the spouse and daughter of veterans, a military family member and advocate, I have watched families rebuild care after a move. TRICARE provides essential coverage to millions of beneficiaries. Initiatives like the CPD are vital for building on what works and expanding access through new options.

At CareSource Military & Veterans, our teams include veterans, military spouses, and caregivers who know the routine. This lived experience has shaped our approach, offering real-time support, expanded access to behavioral health, and providers who understand what service-connected care means.

We are also focused on education. Many families do not know that CareSource Military & Veterans is an option under the CPD. Our mission is to make the path clear.

It is about collaboration, listening to families, and continuing to build systems that serve both readiness and well-being.

Military families serve too. And they deserve a health care experience that reflects their commitment, not just in theory but in practice, access, and follow-through.

Military families need a health plan that offers reliable access to care, understands their unique experiences, and helps them navigate the responsibilities of military life. That is what the CPD aims to provide. And that is what we are committed to building together.",https://www.wearethemighty.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/families-choice.jpg?quality=85&w=1200,N,0.0,2025-11-12 11:57:13.870549

If you’re part of the military community or a veteran, you probably already know TRICARE helps cover your healthcare costs. But have you ever scratched your head wondering, “Where on earth is my TRICARE policy number?” It’s one of those little details that suddenly becomes super important when you’re trying to access benefits or file a claim.

Let’s face it: whenever you go to see a new provider or need to get paperwork sorted, showing your TRICARE policy number is often required. Whether you’re:

Registering for care with a healthcare provider

Filing a claim for reimbursement

Verifying your coverage status

Renewing or updating your health coverage

Knowing exactly where to find that number can save you a ton of stress and time. The good news? It’s usually not buried too deep if you know where to look.

Step-by-Step Guide to Finding Your TRICARE Policy Number Online

Here’s a straightforward approach to track down your TRICARE policy number by logging into trusted resources online–perfect if you don’t have your physical ID card handy or need to double-check your info.

1. Access the Defense Enrollment Eligibility Reporting System (DEERS)

Most TRICARE information is tied to your DEERS profile. This is where military eligibility and insurance details are stored. If you haven’t set up your account yet, it’s worth doing so at MilConnect.

2. Log In Using Your CAC or DS Logon

Once on MilConnect, you’ll sign in either with your Common Access Card (CAC) or DS Logon credentials. These secure logins protect your sensitive info, so keep your details close.

3. Navigate to the ‘Show Proof of Coverage’ Section

Inside your MilConnect account, look for options like ‘View/Renew Coverage’ or ‘Proof of TRICARE Coverage.’ This section provides official documentation, including your policy number, which acts as your coverage identifier.

4. Check Your TRICARE ID Card

Often, the TRICARE policy number is printed right on your ID card—sometimes called the sponsor’s identification number. If you have the card but aren’t sure where to look, it’s commonly near the top or under the sponsor’s name.

5. Contact TRICARE Support If Needed

If online routes aren’t helping out, calling TRICARE customer service can be the way to go. They can confirm your policy number and explain how to retrieve it securely.

This video walks you through how to find TRICARE providers and, implicitly, the info you’ll likely need on hand—like your policy number—when scheduling appointments. It’s a handy visual if you’re more of a follow-along learner.

Top Mistakes to Avoid When Searching for Your TRICARE Information

Assuming Your Policy Number is the Same as Your Social Security Number: TRICARE explicitly avoids using SSNs on cards or documentation to protect privacy. Trying to use your SSN will just lead to confusion and potential denial of claims.

Overlooking the DEERS Database: Many don’t realize that if your DEERS info isn’t current, your TRICARE policy number – and thus coverage – might not be recognized correctly. Always keep your DEERS profile up to date.

Relying Solely on Paper Cards: Lost or outdated physical cards can mislead you. Using the online MilConnect portal usually provides the most current and accurate numbers.

Sharing Personal Details Over Unofficial Channels: Stay alert against scammers. TRICARE does not request your policy number through random phone calls or emails, so double-check who you’re talking with.

Expert Tips for Keeping Your TRICARE Documents Organized and Accessible

Managing healthcare info can feel like juggling flaming torches, especially when claims deadlines loom. Here’s some advice from people who’ve lived through it and won’t let the chaos get them twice.

Use a Dedicated Folder (Physical or Digital): Keep all TRICARE-related documents, including your ID card, statements, and correspondence, in one spot. Apps like Evernote or Google Drive make digital archiving effortless and accessible anywhere.

Set Calendar Reminders: Mark dates for renewing coverage or submitting claims. It’s easy to let these slip, causing unnecessary stress.

Update Your DEERS Info Promptly: A quick check-in every six months can prevent surprises when benefits don’t go through as expected.

Share Essential Info Securely: When family members or caregivers need access, use password-protected shares or direct them to official sites with instructions.

According to official TRICARE resources, keeping your proof of coverage accessible can significantly speed up claims processes, reducing waiting time and headaches.

How to Use Your TRICARE Policy Number for Benefits and Claims

Once you’ve got your policy number, knowing exactly how to use it is just as important. It acts as your key to getting the healthcare services you’re entitled to and making sure providers get paid without hassle.

Booking Appointments with TRICARE Providers

This number confirms your enrollment and eligibility when you call to schedule an appointment. Some providers may ask for it upfront before even booking, so have it handy.

Submitting Claims

If you get care outside the network, filing a claim manually usually requires including your TRICARE policy number. It identifies the coverage applying to that specific treatment or consultation.

Verifying Eligibility

When switching plans or updating dependents, your policy number verifies that you or your family members meet TRICARE requirements. It’s a quick way to prevent denials based on missing or mismatched data.

Renewals and Updates

Your policy number is often needed to renew your benefits or update any personal info that could affect your coverage.

Visual Guide: Navigating TRICARE’s Website to Retrieve Your Policy Number

If you’re a visual learner, a little guided tour can make this all click. Here’s a layout to help you sail online with confidence.

Start by logging into your account at MilConnect, then look for eligibility or coverage tabs. Your policy number is usually displayed alongside other vital details like sponsor name, plan type, and effective dates.

Additional Handy Tip

Besides the official channels, sometimes your healthcare provider’s billing department can help verify your TRICARE policy number if you’re stuck.

At CareSource Military & Veterans, our teams include veterans, military spouses, and caregivers who know the routine. This lived experience has shaped our approach, offering real-time support, expanded access to behavioral health, and providers who understand what service-connected care means.

We are also focused on education. Many families do not know that CareSource Military & Veterans is an option under the CPD. Our mission is to make the path clear.

It is about collaboration, listening to families, and continuing to build systems that serve both readiness and well-being.

Military families serve too. And they deserve a health care experience that reflects their commitment, not just in theory but in practice, access, and follow-through.

Military families need a health plan that offers reliable access to care, understands their unique experiences, and helps them navigate the responsibilities of military life. That is what the CPD aims to provide. And that is what we are committed to building together.

Eric Flores is a Board Member for the Northeast Indiana Base Community Council. He

“If they have Servicemember’s Group Life Insurance or TriCare, those policies cannot lapse. The premiums are paid on their behalf and as soon as they go back to duty and get that first paycheck, they would have a debt to the government. It’s like digging yourself out of the hole.”

One lump sum, “taxed at a higher rate the net pay is probably not going to cover the hole that they’re in. Besides a missed payment, you’re looking at late fees and delinquencies. It will definitely trickle down.”

The NIBCC gives one time grants to servicemembers up to $800. Flores said over the past few years, an increasing amount of grants have been given out, starting out with $14,000 in 2021, rising to $63,351 in 2024. So far this year, the NIBCC has distributed $73,975, the bulk of which was given during the government shutdown.

Since October 15, the NIBCC has approved all 60 grant requests, a rate that Flores said is unsustainable for the agency.

“We’ve raised about $100,000 between two of our events, in the last three weeks we probably awarded $50,000 in grants. At this rate, we are likely to run out of the funds we’ve raised.”

Flores said he expects requests to keep coming.

“There may be an end in sight; it’s not a matter of disapproving or approving of the government shutdown, that’s our elected officials’ problem. In addition to the current need, eventually it’s just going to trickle down. There’s going to be late fees, there’s going to be delinquency fees, there’s also going to be our holidays, where we always see more grant requests coming through.”

Have a reserve account but he’s hoping other people will see the need for servicemembers

“It’s not as isolated as this shutdown, there’s a lot that our servicemembers endure, two different sets of orders

“We know many of our people in the United States work paycheck to paycheck. One missed paycheck really does have an impact.”

The bulk of the grant money is used for housing. The most need is coming from Allen County from the 122nd fighter wing.",https://www.wane.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/21/2025/11/NIBCC-6.jpg?w=1280,N,0.0,2025-11-12 11:57:22.846193

So, you know, a lot of different barriers potentially to care for the military family.
So yes, the military members try to access care on the outside.
There’s legislation in the House from Rep. Sarah Jacobs that is aiming to increase access for military families to this treatment.","Terry Gerton Welcome back to this special Veterans Day edition: The best of the Federal Drive with Terry Gerton on Federal News Network. The White House is working to lower the cost of IVF, putting fertility care in the spotlight. But military families often face extra hurdles when trying to start a family, whether it’s deployments, relocations, or the demands of service. New legislation aims to close that gap. To help us understand the medical side of this issue, Federal News Network’s Eric spoke with Dr. Michael Wittenberger, a reproductive endocrinologist and Navy veteran who spent years treating veterans and their families.

Eric White So obviously, they’re not the only ones that can struggle with infertility, but what is it in particular about military families, where they have even more of an issue getting treatment for it? What are some of the roadblocks of the jobs that they entail that kind of getting in the way? What is what is that you have seen?

Michael Wittenberger The military by its nature is just a different organization completely than what most people are. The military mission takes precedence, and so the military mission often will require that service members are separated from their families. That can be while they are watch-standing, it can be on workups, it can be on deployment. So there’s frequent separations between the partners that are trying to get pregnant. And so using different surveys, there seems to be an increase in the difficulty for military family members in planning and executing a family. And when you look at the prevalence of infertility in the military, it seems like it’s higher than the civilian population. So in addition to these frequent interruptions and the continuity between partners, there’s a number of other things that are inherent to just the military. There’s different jobs that you have, and there’s different expectations for different duty assignment. It’s expected while you’re on sea duty that you don’t try to get pregnant because you’re expected to deploy even though you may be in port and you may not be deployable at that moment. At the time that you’re there, you’re expected not to get pregnant. The other half is okay to get pregnant, but again, there’s other things like access to care. When I retired in 2022, I was one of three active-duty reproductive endocrinologists and infertility specialists in the entire Navy. That’s serving, you know, the approximately 500,000 active-duty Navy and Marines on both coasts and around the world. So you can imagine when there’s just a couple or three specialists that there’s going to be bottlenecks in care. And a lot of times the sailors, the marines, the service members are going to located remotely so there’s not going to a local catchment where they can be seen and taken care of. So another barrier to care is really just a delay in diagnosis for many of them for getting the care, they’ll be out in an area they can’t access care, so they have to wait to come back to a military training facility that actually has a reproductive endocrinologist to try to get access to care. So, you know, a lot of different barriers potentially to care for the military family.

Eric White I guess we can start with your interaction with these patients. Was that a frustration that you heard a lot in treating service members, you know, “it took me two months to get this appointment”? Did some of them seek help outside of their respective military branch?

Michael Wittenberger I would say that’s always been a concern of people trying to access care, is that the delay to get in and see a specialist is hard or that they need to go out and see fertility specialist in the civilian world. The problem with that is that in both cases, TRICARE, they completely covered the diagnostics of trying to diagnose you with infertility, but the treatment options are very limited with TRICARE for active duty. They consist basically of any treatment option that uses coitus as a form of conception. So that means anything with artificial insemination, IVF, fertility preservation in many cases is not covered by TRICARE. So yes, the military members try to access care on the outside. And they find out that they have to cover the bill, and so that’s a huge financial burden for them. Even within the military, there’s a thought that if they can get care at the military treatment facility with a reproductive endocrinologist as active duty, that it’ll be covered. Well, that’s only partially true. So TRICARE has an exception to the lack of coverage that allows them to, for graduate medical education purposes, provide some additional care, like artificial insemination and the monitoring for IVF, the medications for IVF. So it does slightly reduce the cost of IVF, but since there’s no embryology team in any of the military services, there’s still a lot of expenses that the patient needs to contract with the civilian embryology lab or IVF center to actually cover.

Eric White And so let’s finish up here with some of the solutions that have been proposed and other ones that you think could be implemented. There’s legislation in the House from Rep. Sarah Jacobs that is aiming to increase access for military families to this treatment. What do you know about that? And what else could be done to make this an easier process for those that are looking to serve their country, but also want to fulfill their familial wishes?",https://federalnewsnetwork.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Military-Family-Advisory-Network.jpeg,N,0.0,2025-11-11 16:01:02.081521

Yesterday, on Monday, Nov. 10, 17 transgender servicemembers, each with 15–18 years of service in the United States Air Force and United States Space Force filed a lawsuit, Ireland v. United States, against the Trump administration in the Federal Court of Claims for taking away the retirement money they earned, and which had been previously granted to them by the Secretary of the Air Force.

Each of these families faces a potential loss of up to $1–2 million over the course of their lifetimes. GLAD Law’s Attorney Michael Haley spoke to that “senseless and shocking affront” to our troops in a statement release: “These brave transgender servicemembers deserve the retirement benefits they have earned and that the Air Force granted them. As a country, we must honor our word to them, not rip away their benefits.”

Beyond the loss of retirement funds, lifetime access to TRICARE health insurance was rescinded, which would have allowed them to receive healthcare from civilian or non-VA medical facilities.

Back in June, the Air Force had issued retirement orders to transgender Airmen plaintiffs in this case. Two months later, the Air Force backed out of its retirement promise. Airmen were informed that they must be separated from the military without retirement under the new transgender military ban, instituted by Pete Hegseth, the former Fox News Host who was named head of the Defense Department (now Department of War), under the Trump Administration.

Related: Trump Signs Executive Order Banning Transgender People In The Military

The stage was set earlier in the year, when Donald J. Trump issued an Executive Order, signed on Air Force One, aimed at banning transgender service members within the U.S. military. The EO stated that “expressing a false ‘gender identity’ divergent from an individual’s sex cannot satisfy the rigorous standards necessary for military service.”

“I raised my hand and served my country honorably for 15 years, including a deployment to Afghanistan,” said Master Sergeant Logan Ireland, the lead plaintiff in the current lawsuit. “Ripping away the retirements we have earned is a betrayal of the sacrifices made by servicemembers and our families. We should not be thrown into economic hardship or made to feel our years of service are regarded by our country as meaningless.”

Plaintiffs in this case are represented by the National Center for LGBTQ Rights, GLAD Law, and pro-bono counsel from Stapleton Segal Cochran LLC and The Law Office of Jeremy Spiegel.

Medicaid and veteran care: Zelnick urges shifting from fee-for-service to outcome-based reimbursement, using 6-month treatment retention as a benchmark of clinical success; emphasizes rapid access, weekly community engagement, and abstinence as key metrics.

Policy implications: Warns that restricting Medicaid or Affordable Care Act (ACA) access could endanger patients with substance use disorder; calls for integration between the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) and community providers and incentives for TRICARE/Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS participation to expand veteran care access.

Please introduce yourself by stating your name, title, and any relevant experience you’d like to share.

Cooper Zelnick: I'm Cooper Zelnik. I'm the CEO of Groups Recover Together. We are the nation's largest value-based provider of addiction treatment. Fundamentally, the way I describe our work is, we serve folks who are struggling with addiction using a unique model that includes evidence-based medicine but also community, group therapy, and wraparound services. That model drives powerful clinical outcomes for the folks we serve, reducing relapses, overdoses, and mortality.

Those clinical outcomes translate into cost outcomes for our health plan and state partners, including reductions in total cost, reductions in recidivism and return to custody rates in the criminal justice setting, and reductions in emergency room and inpatient utilization. We help reduce health care spend by helping people get healthy.

What does it mean to “reward recovery” in Medicaid, and how would you measure real success for veterans in treatment for substance abuse?

Zelnick: It's worth noting that, historically, our health care system has not paid for outcomes. Specifically, in behavioral health and substance use disorder treatment, reimbursement and payments have been tied to the delivery of services, not to the achievement of outcomes or milestones.

For us, rewarding recovery is two things. The first thing is that we have to agree on what success looks like. The second thing is that we have to compensate for success to incentivize more of that success. What does success look like?

The easy answer is, success looks like retention in treatment at 6 months. It's the key benchmark of clinical efficacy in our industry. If a provider can retain a patient in outpatient care for 6 months, then it is less likely that that person will relapse, less likely that they'll overdose, less likely that they will die from this disease, and cost goes down. When we think about rewarding success, that's the easiest place.

It's not the whole story. Rapid access to care really matters. Weekly engagement with a supportive community really matters. Abstinence from illicit substances really matters. What we believe is that we should affect a switch in this country from paying for delivering services to paying for delivering outcomes.

How could value-based payment models change the way care is delivered to veterans struggling with substance use disorder?

Zelnick: Care is delivered based upon what is reimbursed. The things that are reimbursed off a traditional Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) fee schedule, which is driving how most veterans receive care, are individual appointments with a doctor, drug screening, and drug testing. Those activities are not the activities that most promote recovery. The activities that most promote recovery are therapy, peer interactions, care coordination, and activities that foster and build community.

Value-based payment models that align around outcomes and incentivize services that help people achieve those outcomes are the way that I would recommend transforming payment systems around addiction and recovery.

What are the biggest barriers that keep veterans from getting consistent care between the VA and community-based programs?

Zelnick: The VA does an amazing job. Many veterans rely upon the VA for any number of services, including addiction treatment services. The folks who work at VA hospitals across the country are dedicated, committed, passionate, and amazing.

It is also the case that, at many VA hospitals, there are wait lists for services. There are moments where veterans are unable to access care through the VA and need to go to community providers. That interaction is challenging. Community providers could probably do a better job of integrating with local VA hospitals. In certain cases, the same is true in the opposite direction. Building a more integrated system of care helps to eliminate a barrier.

It's been our experience that many local community providers don't contract with TRICARE, aren't Medicare enrolled, and, as a result, actually aren't contracted or empowered to serve this population. We work with TRICARE, we work with CMS, and we are really passionate about that work. It's super important to us. We're really proud of it and we do it everywhere. But it's challenging. There are documentation requirements, enrollment requirements, and contracting requirements.

I actually don't know whether it's possible to reduce those barriers, but I think incentivizing providers to serve that population would be really valuable as a way of expanding access to care.

If Congress moves forward with major health care reform, what changes would make the biggest difference for veterans’ recovery outcomes?

Zelnick: The two big proposed health care changes are the potential expiration of the Affordable Care Act (ACA) subsidies and the significant constriction of Medicaid. That's not the intent. The intent is to include work requirements, but, as a practical matter, there will be a greater number of folks who cannot access ACA marketplace insurance and a greater number of folks who will no longer be Medicaid eligible.

The big thing that would make a difference is being thoughtful about maintaining access, specifically for folks struggling with active substance use disorder. If they lose insurance, those patients are at high risk. If they lose access to care, they are super vulnerable and costly to our system. It is the right investment to make, to preserve access to health insurance and access to health care services for those who are struggling with substance use disorders. Anything we can do as a society to help those folks keep access to care, keep access to insurance, and keep getting the lifesaving medications and services they need is the right answer.

Is there anything else you hope that the audience will take away from this?",https://hmp-websites.s3.amazonaws.com/hmp_ln/styles/max_650x650/s3/2025-11/Zelnick.jpeg?itok=0MhC6cAT,N,0.0,2025-11-11 16:01:19.688570

As Virginia personal injury lawyers, we know there are concerns about how the shutdown could impact claims. A key issue is the effect it has on TRICARE and Medicare liens.

The most important thing to know is that these liens are delayed, not eliminated. But it’s also important to understand how TRICARE and Medicare liens work, and that delays or interruptions like the shutdown affect personal injury case resolution and lien negotiations.

What is a Medicare or TRICARE Lien?

If someone is injured and Medicare or TRICARE paid for medical treatment, Medicare and Tricare are entitled to recover the amount they paid if the injured party obtains a judgment or settlement from a personal injury claim. Recouping medical fees they covered is referred to as a TRICARE lien or Medicare lien, and there are strict processes that must be followed to reimburse them.

Liens ensure that federal medical programs are reimbursed when another party is held responsible for paying someone’s medical fees. The other party is considered the primary payor, and could be the person who caused the injury, their insurer, or workers’ compensation benefits. In these cases, TRICARE and Medicare are secondary payors.

For example, if you’re injured in a Virginia car accident and the other driver was found to be fully at fault through a personal injury claim, that driver’s insurance company is responsible for paying your medical bills and property damages. If Medicare or TRICARE initially covered your medical treatment, they’ll place a lien on your settlement to get back what they paid.

Can a Medicare Lien or TRICARE Lien Be Negotiated During the Shutdown?

Personal injury victims should be prepared for some delays with Medicare and TRICARE processing and customer support during the government shutdown, including negotiations. But negotiating a lien is an important step when a personal injury case settles. Why? There’s a specific process for how personal injury settlements are paid out, which includes paying Medicare liens and TRICARE liens first – before funds are disbursed to the victim. An attorney experienced in Medicare or TRICARE liens will get the best outcome in negotiations. In terms of liens being waived, it’s extremely rare, but it happens sometimes.

How the Shutdown Affects Resolving Personal Injury Claims

The government may not be fully operational, but Medicare and TRICARE lien rights still exist. While personal injury cases already take significant time to resolve, the shutdown is expected to cause some hiccups.

There are a few ways a personal injury claim may be affected during the government shutdown:

There will be operational slowdowns and delays because both TRICARE and Medicare are federal programs.

A backlog is possible once the government reopens.

Your attorney may need to estimate lien amounts or hold funds from the settlement in trust until the exact amount is confirmed.

In addition, if negotiations or getting the lien amount are delayed because of the shutdown, your personal injury case cannot be fully resolved; you may be awarded a settlement, but it cannot be fully disbursed until after the lien is paid. In such situations, a sufficient amount of money will be held in the lawyer’s trust account at the time of disbursement to the client to cover the anticipated TRICARE and Medicare liens.

Compliance with Medicare and TRICARE is crucial, and failing to comply puts you at risk of severe penalties. An attorney can walk you through the process and negotiate on your behalf to secure the compensation you deserve.

At Curcio Law, we’re committed to managing the challenges of the government shutdown and its effect on our clients’ cases. If you have any questions or concerns about your case or a lien, or if you were injured and someone else may be liable, contact our firm online or call/text (703) 836-3366.

Lien FAQs

Who Handles Lien Processing for Medicare and TRICARE?

The Defense Health Agency and its contractors handle TRICARE lien processing. The responsibility of handling Medicare lien processing falls on the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid (CMS), a part of the Department of Health and Human Services.

How Lien Amounts are Determined

Once Medicare or TRICARE is notified of a personal injury settlement, they’ll provide a breakdown of services and treatment they paid for that need to be reimbursed. Reviewing this information is a crucial step and should involve the help of an attorney. These programs are only allowed to recover medical costs they paid for if a personal injury settlement or judgment is obtained, which includes compensation for medical expenses.

TRICARE and Medicare Reporting Requirements

Personal injury cases that involve Medicare payments must be reported to the Benefits Coordination & Recovery Center. Failing to report to the BCRC can lead to serious penalties.

For TRICARE, if they receive a claim that they deem may involve third-party liability, they’ll send a form to the claimant to complete. Once submitted, it will be used to determine what happened and whether someone else is responsible for paying for the medical treatment a beneficiary received. While TRICARE will automatically send the third-party liability form when certain codes for medical care are used, you should always notify them if you’re pursuing a personal injury claim.",https://www.legalexaminer.com/content/images/2025/11/government-shutdown@large.jpg,N,0.0,2025-11-11 11:00:41.243388

Obesity is more than just carrying around a few extra pounds—it is a complex chronic condition that puts individuals at a higher risk of serious health issues, such as hypertension (high blood pressure), Type 2 diabetes, stroke, and certain mental health conditions.

These concerns, along with a desire to lose weight, are why weight loss medications are becoming more commonplace. While prescription weight loss medications have been on the market for decades, such as phentermine, the newer GLP-1s, including Ozempic (used off-label for weight loss) and Wegovy, have been generally shown to be more effective than previous treatments.

Each health insurance company has different guidelines on weight loss medication coverage, and these benefits vary between the company’s various health plans. For those on Tricare, the healthcare program for the uniformed services, weight loss medications may be covered in certain situations. Approval of these drugs from the Defense Health Agency hinges on a few factors, which you can learn more about below.

Does Tricare cover weight loss medication?

There are various Tricare health plans, including those for active duty members, National Guard and Reserve service members, retirees, and eligible family members of these groups. According to an August 2025 update, Tricare states that they do not generally cover weight loss medication. While this may seem like bad news, this does not mean a blanket “no” for weight loss drugs.

Tricare does not cover weight loss drugs at all for the following individuals:

TRICARE For Life beneficiaries

People with direct care coverage (military hospitals and clinics)

Certain other groups (details are not specified)

Tricare states that as of August 31, 2025, these groups will be required to pay 100% of the cost of weight loss medicine—even if a prior authorization had been previously approved.

Tricare MAY cover weight loss drugs such as Wegovy, Saxenda, or Zepbound for weight management for the following groups, as long as you use a TRICARE network provider and the drug is a medical necessity (i.e., you meet prior authorization requirements):

TRICARE Prime and Prime Remote

Uniformed Services Family Health Plan

TRICARE Select

TRICARE Young Adult

TRICARE Reserve Select

TRICARE Retired Reserve

Continued Health Care Benefit Program

Criteria for weight loss medication coverage

Since TRICARE has many different plans, coverage requirements (as well as your copay or out-of-pocket costs) may vary among plans. Your healthcare professional can work with you to navigate your insurance policy and can work on the prior authorization (PA) process. When a PA is required, the healthcare provider will need to submit information to the plan as to why a medicine is medically necessary for you. Typically, insurance plans will want to ensure that you are using the drug for an FDA-approved use, such as Zepbound for moderate to severe sleep apnea in adults with obesity. You can contact your specific plan for more information on weight loss medication coverage.

How to get approved for weight loss medication

With TRICARE’s August 2025 update, all prescription weight loss drugs will require a PA—but not all TRICARE plans cover weight loss drugs (see section above). If your plan pays for weight loss drugs with an approved PA, your healthcare provider will need to submit information to the plan explaining why the drug is medically necessary for you. They will need to submit supporting information, such as weight, body mass index (BMI), and notes from your visit.

If your healthcare provider prescribes a GLP-1 for weight loss, they must prescribe the FDA-approved version for weight loss. “The trick to approval is making sure the prescription is sent for the approved weight loss version of the medication,” said Dr. Brown, an obesity medicine specialist with MyObesityTeam. “For example, Tricare won’t pay for Ozempic if it’s prescribed for obesity, but it will pay for Wegovy.”

Ozempic and Wegovy are both injectable medications that contain semaglutide. Ozempic has been approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for managing Type 2 diabetes, and Wegovy has been FDA-approved for weight loss. That means Ozempic would not typically be covered for weight loss under TRICARE insurance, but Wegovy may be covered—if your plan includes weight loss medications and the PA is approved.

How much does weight loss medication cost without insurance?

If your TRICARE plan does not cover the cost of your weight loss medicine, you can pay out of pocket without insurance. It may also be more affordable by using a SingleCare coupon. Here are some of the costs you can expect for the most popular weight loss drugs.

Zepbound (tirzepatide) has an average retail price of $1,532 per 4, 5mg/0.5ml 0.5ml pens, but you can pay just $950 with a Zepbound coupon from SingleCare—a savings of almost $600 per month.

Wegovy (semaglutide) has an average retail price of $1,850 per 4, 0.75ml prefilled 2.4mg/0.75ml pens, but you can pay just $1,225 with a SingleCare savings card, saving you $625 each month.

Saxenda (liraglutide) has an average retail cost of $1,819 for 5, 18mg/3ml (6mg/ml) 3ml pens, but if you fill your Rx with generic liraglutide and use a free SingleCare coupon, you could pay as low as $469, saving you $1,350 per month.

How to check whether your Tricare plan covers weight loss medication

There is a Tricare formulary search tool that provides the usual cost of prescription medications. The formulary is a list of all the medications covered by an insurance plan, along with their corresponding pricing tiers. By filling out the medication form and inputting your sex and age, you’ll get details about the price and requirements for each prescription drug.

How to save on weight loss medication

If insurance won’t cover weight loss medications, you can save on your out-of-pocket costs by using a SingleCare coupon. Use SingleCare’s search bar to find the specific drug and see the discounted costs available at your nearby pharmacies.

The CareSource Tricare Prime Demonstration program is an alternative within the Tricare Prime framework offering comprehensive managed care through CareSource Military and Veterans. Through this program, beneficiaries will receive care through the CareSource provider network instead of the Humana Military network.

Beneficiaries who would like to use this program need to make the switch during the current Tricare open enrollment season, which runs from Nov. 10, 2025, to Dec. 9, 2025, for coverage in 2026.

What’s Different?

I chatted with Ted Painter of CareSource to learn more about how care under this demonstration project will differ from other Tricare Prime options, including US Family Health Plans. Painter is the associate vice president of market operations for CareSource Military and Veterans and a sergeant major in the Marine Corps Reserve.

Read more: Costs for Tricare Are Going Up in 2026

The primary difference is that you’ll use the CareSource network of providers instead of a military treatment facility or the Humana Military Network.

“If a beneficiary's primary care manager is currently at a military treatment facility, we will work with them to transition to a provider in our civilian network, so their care stays coordinated under this model,” Painter explained. So if you currently go to a military treatment facility, you’ll be moving care to new providers.

The CareSource project is supposed to streamline many of the frustrations with traditional Tricare. No referrals are required to see in-network specialists.

“This removes one of the biggest barriers families face when trying to get to the right provider, when and where they need them,” Painter said. Given that referrals are frequently a pain point with Tricare Prime, this may be a highly attractive benefit.

One highlighted benefit of the CareSource demonstration project is robust care management. Painter told me CareSource has “a team that helps coordinate care and follows through so issues don't stall. You also have support on demand, including telehealth, the MyLife app, nurse advice and remote monitoring. Families receive personalized help during more complex times such as pregnancy, behavioral health needs, or recovery after a hospital stay.”

While traditional Tricare has some of these features, such as telehealth, nurse advice and case management, this program may offer them in a different way.

What About Prescriptions?

Prescription drug benefits under the demonstration remain managed by Express Scripts, aligning with the existing Tricare Pharmacy program. Beneficiaries may continue to use military pharmacies and Tricare-certified retail network pharmacies for their prescriptions.

Who Is Eligible to Choose This Program?

Eligible participants include active-duty family members, activated National Guard or Reserve family members, retirees or their family members, and eligible survivors. Geographically, eligibility is based on having a ZIP code in the Atlanta, Georgia, or Tampa, Florida area.

This demonstration program does not include active-duty service members, Tricare Young Adult, or the Transitional Assistance Management Program (TAMP).

Costs and Fees

This program will cost the same as Tricare Prime, based on your service member’s status and Tricare group. However, enrollment fees paid by retirees, their families and survivors will be waived for the first year. This incentive may help reduce total out-of-pocket costs for care for those families who do not meet their annual catastrophic cap.

Most people like having choice in their health care options. This CareSource demonstration is another choice you have during this year’s Tricare open season. Understanding how this demonstration works can help you decide whether you’d like to switch your care for 2026 and beyond. As Painter pointed out, “We are not replacing other Tricare options. This simply gives families another way to use the benefit they have earned, depending on what fits their situation best.”

“Veterans have showed such incredible courage putting their lives on the line to protect our freedoms,” Thompson said.","State Rep. Jamie Thompson recently hosted VFW and other veterans’ organizations at an event in Lansing to promote needed care and awareness for issues facing those who have sacrificed for their country and fellow community members.

Thompson, who is a Licensed Practical Nurse, spoke about safe prescription practices, side effects of psychotropic medications like anti-depressants, and informed consent protections. The event provided evidence-based information about medication-related suicides and veteran suicide prevention strategies.

“I know that drugs save lives. I also know that drugs can destroy lives,” said Thompson, of Brownstown, noting that 70 percent of veterans in VA care are prescribed with psychotropic medications. “There is a fine line between care and preventable harm. Patients deserve every piece of information when being prescribed medication – the good, the bad and the ugly. That is why we call it informed consent. Patients need to have all relevant information to be properly informed.

“Unfortunately, our veterans are often prescribed medication without everything available to them in order to make an informed decision and this produces negative, heartbreaking outcomes. Veterans have become the test subjects of a field in which side effects, drug interactions and long-term effects are sometimes unknown. This was a very constructive conversation that will help veterans, their families and providers know what to look for in case intervention is needed to help improve care and save lives.”

Thompson, who serves on the House Families and Veterans Committee, recently voted for a state budget agreement that makes veterans and service members a top priority. The signed budget fully funds TRICARE health care coverage for Michigan’s National Guard members so their health care is covered when they are called up – even outside of federal deployments.

In September, she welcomed leaders from Downriver for Veterans, a local nonprofit organization that supports veterans across Downriver communities with emergency funds to assist them with rent, meals, utilities, car repairs and other essential life expenses, to Lansing for a House Families and Veterans Committee hearing. The group provided insight on the need for more detailed veteran benefit screening and registration efforts upon discharge to ensure veterans have access to care and knowledge about available resources, including housing.

“Veterans have showed such incredible courage putting their lives on the line to protect our freedoms,” Thompson said. “We owe it to them to bring awareness to these issues and fight for them.”",https://dtj5wlj7ond0z.cloudfront.net/uploads/2025/11/Paitent-Designation_Thmpsn_0625_4-scaled.jpg,N,0.0,2025-11-11 05:00:17.318329

“Ripping away the retirements we have earned is a betrayal of the sacrifices made by servicemembers and our families.
Then, in August 2025, the Air Force reneged on its promises to those Airmen and informed them that they must, instead, be separated without retirement under Secretary Hegseth’s transgender military ban.
The lawsuit argues that the rescission of retirement orders in this case violates the Air Force’s own retirement policies and procedures, which only permit retirement rescissions under very limited circumstances, none of which are present here.
These brave transgender servicemembers deserve the retirement benefits they have earned and that the Air Force granted them.","“Tomorrow is Veterans Day, yet the Trump administration continues to deepen its betrayal of veterans by ripping away the pensions and health care benefits of honorable Airmen who have deployed around the world,” said NCLR Legal Director Shannon Minter

Today, 17 transgender servicemembers who each have over 15 years of service in the United States Air Force and Space Force filed Ireland v. United States, a lawsuit against the Trump administration in the Federal Court of Claims for rescinding the retirements they earned and that were previously granted to them by the Secretary of the Air Force. Transgender servicemembers impacted by this rescission will face a loss of up to $1–2 million owed for their service over the course of their lifetime, impacting these military families’ long-term economic security. This rescission also includes loss of lifetime access to TRICARE health insurance, which would have provided access to civilian health care providers beyond VA facilities.

“I raised my hand and served my country honorably for 15 years, including a deployment to Afghanistan,” said lead plaintiff Master Sergeant Logan Ireland. “Ripping away the retirements we have earned is a betrayal of the sacrifices made by servicemembers and our families. We should not be thrown into economic hardship or made to feel our years of service are regarded by our country as meaningless.”

In June 2025, the Air Force issued retirement orders to transgender Airmen plaintiffs in this case. Then, in August 2025, the Air Force reneged on its promises to those Airmen and informed them that they must, instead, be separated without retirement under Secretary Hegseth’s transgender military ban. The lawsuit argues that the rescission of retirement orders in this case violates the Air Force’s own retirement policies and procedures, which only permit retirement rescissions under very limited circumstances, none of which are present here.

“Tomorrow is Veterans Day, yet the Trump administration continues to deepen its betrayal of veterans by ripping away the pensions and health care benefits of honorable Airmen who have deployed around the world,” said NCLR Legal Director Shannon Minter, one of the lead attorneys in this case, who is transgender and brings more than 30 years of civil rights legal experience to this litigation. “There has never been an administration that has shown such open hostility to the brave men and women who have served our country.”

Pensions are an essential part of the promise made to servicemembers due to their sacrifices and help military families avoid economic hardship. These pensions are earned and compensate servicemembers for the unique sacrifices and constraints of military life that make it difficult to save for retirement and create the diversified retirement portfolios that civilians can. For example, because of frequent job-related moves, members of our military typically cannot purchase a house and live there for 20 years to grow equity.

“This is a senseless and shocking affront to troops who have sacrificed so much for our country,” said GLAD Law Staff Attorney Michael Haley. “Each of these families faces a potential loss of up to $1–2 million over the course of their lifetimes. These brave transgender servicemembers deserve the retirement benefits they have earned and that the Air Force granted them. As a country, we must honor our word to them, not rip away their benefits.”

Tricare Prime Demo by CSMV is taking out the referral headache and expanding access to care to about 146,000 eligible beneficiaries in the Tampa, Florida, and Atlanta, Georgia, metro areas. This pilot is under the Tricare Competitive Plans Demonstration and will measure whether or not the intended outcomes improve the overall healthcare experience. It may also inform future nationwide Tricare changes. By choosing CSMV’s plan, active-duty service members, survivors, retirees, and their families get their choice network providers directly.

CSMV plans to set up coordination teams that will be a dedicated one-stop shop for contact, scheduling, and follow-ups. Members will have online tools and a nurse advice line. Enrollment fees will also be waived for the first year from when enrollment begins.

Military.com had the chance to interview Selene Martin, CareSource Associate Vice President, Corporate Affairs.

Kimberly O’Brien, Military.com: Please tell us about yourself. What is your background, and how has this shaped your vision for the future of healthcare for the military community?

Selene Martin, CareSource Associate Vice President, Corporate Affairs: I am the Associate Vice President of Corporate Affairs for CareSource Military & Veterans, leading strategy and stakeholder engagement for our military programs. This includes serving on the TRICARE Prime Demo’s Design and Management Team, where we listen deeply to the community and work to earn trust through clarity, connection, and care. My professional journey blends corporate impact with military family advocacy. Before joining CareSource, I directed military philanthropy at USAA, where I led initiatives in mental health, economic mobility, and veteran suicide prevention, driving impactful programs that enhanced access to essential resources for the military community. Additionally, I spent 15 years at LexisNexis focusing on social impact initiatives related to justice and equity, and have served on several national advisory councils supporting military spouses and veterans. I am also a military spouse, which means health care decisions are not just data points or spreadsheets to me. I know how complex and deeply personal they can be. I came to CareSource to be part of an effort that seeks to see families and hear their needs, support them, and ultimately empower them to make decisions that are right for their family. I envision a health care landscape where plans fully reflect the real lives of the people they serve, and I’m proud to be part of a team working to make that vision a reality.

O’Brien: What is the TRICARE Prime Demo by CareSource Military & Veterans, and how does it differ from the traditional TRICARE Prime option available to beneficiaries?

Martin: The TRICARE Prime Demo is a pilot program developed by the Department of Defense to demonstrate new ways of providing connected care to military families. CareSource Military & Veterans is bringing this reality to life in Atlanta and Tampa. The underlying TRICARE Prime benefit hasn’t changed. We’re changing the experience around it. We’re enhancing the program with military family-inspired features like a 24/7 nurse advice line, no referrals for in-network care, a portal to easily access and share important information, and care managers with lived experience in navigating care. We’re part of a nonprofit, with military in our DNA, and we’re building a health plan that feels personal, responsive and reliable for the families that depend on it every day.

O’Brien: How does CareSource Military & Veterans plan to address the unique needs of military families, retirees, and survivors in the Tampa and Atlanta metro areas?

Martin: We started by listening. Before offering coverage, we spent time learning directly from families, retirees, and base leaders in both communities. We heard a lot about the need for timely information, clearer navigation and care that adapts to family transitions. That’s why our approach is centered on community connection and proactive support. From digital tools to multilingual materials to peer support teams with lived military experience, we’ve built this plan with the realities of military life in mind, especially for those who often feel overlooked.

O’Brien: What measures are being taken to ensure timely access to providers, especially given the challenges many military families face with relocations and continuity of care?

Martin: We know that finding the right provider and maintaining consistent care are among the biggest stressors in military life. To address this, we leverage technology and strong relationships with provider networks. We’ve invested in digital tools that make it easier to search for in-network providers based on location, language, specialty, and military familiarity. We’ve also partnered with provider networks that understand the pace of military life. Whether someone is new to the area, in transition, or hasn’t used civilian care in a while, our job is to meet them with clear answers and a path forward.

O’Brien: What specific features or services set CareSource Military & Veterans apart from other TRICARE options, and why might beneficiaries consider switching?

Martin: The TRICARE benefit is the same, but your experience will be different. At CareSource Military & Veterans, we’re adding layers of support designed to make it easier for you to find information and help when you need it. We have care managers with experience in navigating both physical and behavioral health needs. Additionally, we offer tools aimed at reducing the day-to-day stress of military life. We also hear from many families who want their care experience to feel personal, not just procedural. That’s why service is our top priority. As part of a nonprofit with military roots, our entire team is dedicated to you, your health, and building trust so we can be a steady partner in your care.

O’Brien: If this demonstration project proves successful, how do you envision the program expanding or shaping the future of TRICARE coverage nationwide?

Martin: The DoD established this demo to find out if innovative solutions can improve how TRICARE works for military families. If this demonstration is successful, it will help shape the future of TRICARE for military and veteran communities around the country. Success for us at CareSource Military & Veterans is simple: Did families feel seen? Did they receive support? Did they find care when and how they needed it? Did we keep up with their pace of military life? If we can answer yes to all these questions, then we will have demonstrated that a health plan can bring both high-quality and humanity to the services it provides. That’s the kind of example we want to set, and that’s why we’re proud to have been selected for this demonstration.

O’Brien: Is there anything else you want our readers to know?

Martin: If you’re eligible and living in the Atlanta or Tampa metro areas, I encourage you to explore the new TRICARE Prime Demo option with CareSource Military & Veterans during this year’s Open Season. We understand that switching plans is a significant decision. You deserve to feel supported, informed, seen, and valued. And we’ll keep showing up to make sure that happens.

Open season for FEDVIP is Nov. 10–Dec.","Beginning Nov. 10, military retirees and eligible beneficiaries who use Tricare can enroll in or make changes to their health care coverage.

Tricare open season, which runs through Dec. 9, allows beneficiaries who use Tricare Prime, Tricare Select or the U.S. Family Health Plan to stay on their plan, enroll in a plan or change plans. Changes go into effect Jan. 1.

Beneficiaries who are satisfied with their plan don’t need to do anything—their coverage will continue automatically for 2026.

Those who are not already in a plan and don’t enroll during open season could still receive care, but they will “only be eligible for care at a military hospital or clinic if space is available,” according to the Tricare website. Outside of Tricare open season, beneficiaries can enroll or change their enrollment following certain life events, including marriage, the birth of a child or retirement from active duty.

For 2026, active-duty family members, retirees and their eligible family members In Atlanta and Tampa, Florida, also can enroll in a new Tricare Prime option. Managed by CareSource Military and Veterans, enrollees will get care from CareSource’s network of primary and specialty care providers. Part of a three-year test, the program aims to give beneficiaries an additional option while improving access to care, officials said when the program was announced in May.

Open season does not apply to active-duty service members. It also does not apply to Tricare for Life—coverage is automatic for eligible beneficiaries who have Medicare Part A and Part B, according to Tricare.

Premium-based plans, including Tricare Reserve Select, Retired Reserve and Young Adult, also are not impacted by open season. Eligible beneficiaries can buy these plans at any time throughout the year, according to Tricare.

Additionally, eligible military beneficiaries have until Dec. 8 to enroll in or make changes to their vision and/or dental coverage through the Federal Employees Dental and Vision Insurance Program. Known as FEDVIP, the program, managed by the Office of Personnel Management, offers a range of plans at varying costs, and coverage is not automatic, so beneficiaries must act to enroll in a dental or vision plan.

Open season for FEDVIP is Nov. 10–Dec. 8.
