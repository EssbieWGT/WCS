Specifically, the law applies only to minors, while the Pentagon is restricting health care for all dependents.
“This is a sweeping reversal of military health policy and a betrayal of military families who have sacrificed for our country,” Sarah Austin, staff attorney at GLAD Law, said in a statement.
The restrictions on gender-affirmation health care are part of a broader effort by the Trump administration to erase transgender people from public life.
In addition to kicking out transgender troops and denying health care to transgender military kids, the administration has banned books about transgender people from Defense Department schools and ended gender-affirmation care at the Department of Veterans Affairs.","Military families with transgender children are suing the Pentagon over the Trump administration’s efforts to cut off gender-affirming health care to military dependents.

In a lawsuit filed Monday, three families are alleging that the administration’s moves go beyond a law that was passed last year to restrict gender-affirming care for military children and violate a separate law that says federal regulations cannot be “arbitrary and capricious.”

“Tricare’s sudden refusal to cover medically necessary care has inflicted profound harm on plaintiffs,” the lawsuit says.

“Their prescriptions have been cut off without notice,” it continues. “Their trusted doctors at military hospitals have been forced to abandon them. Plaintiffs’ families now face significant and, in some cases, crushing out-of-pocket costs or the prospect of watching their family member’s health deteriorate without the medications that kept them healthy and stable. This is not an abstract policy shift – it is an immediate and devastating disruption of essential health care that affects the physical and psychological well-being of plaintiffs and other young people throughout the country.”

A Defense Department spokesperson declined to comment on active litigation.

The plaintiffs in the lawsuit, which was filed by two LGBTQ+ advocacy groups on behalf of the families, are anonymous to protect the children’s privacy. But the suit details the families’ struggles to get care.

Two of the children, referred to in the lawsuit as Diana Doe and Nathan Noe, were taking hormones with their parents’ consent on the advice of their doctors at Walter Reed National Military Medical Center in Maryland. This spring, they were told by their Walter Reed doctors that the medical center could no longer provide the hormone therapy, but neither family ever received a notice from Tricare about benefits changing, according to the lawsuit.

The third plaintiff, known as Parker Poe, who is described as a young adult, has been unable to access treatment after his doctor at an unnamed medical facility informed the family that Tricare would no longer cover his testosterone or related care.

“He is months overdue for the lab work that he needs to monitor his treatment. Additionally, without Tricare coverage, Parker’s prescription for testosterone [redacted] was too expensive to purchase out-of-pocket,” the lawsuit says. “This process has resulted in unnecessary stress and panic.”

The hardships detailed in the lawsuit come after Congress passed a law last year that barred Tricare from covering any “medical interventions for the treatment of gender dysphoria that could result in sterilization” for beneficiaries who are minors.

The law didn’t specify which treatments would be banned, but it was widely expected to prohibit hormone therapy and puberty blockers, as well as surgery, which is a very rare treatment for transgender minors.

In January, President Donald Trump also issued an executive order that attempted to ban any federal funding from going toward puberty blockers, hormones or surgery for anyone under 19 years old.

Throughout the spring, defense health officials issued policies and memos to implement the law and the executive order that cumulatively barred military treatment facilities from providing and Tricare from covering gender-affirmation care for military dependents of any age, including minors and adult children.

Trump’s executive order and the Pentagon’s implementation go beyond what last year’s law required, the lawsuit argues. Specifically, the law applies only to minors, while the Pentagon is restricting health care for all dependents.

Further, the lawsuit said, the law “does not support a categorical ban” on puberty blockers and hormone therapy.

“Puberty blockers and hormones for treatment of gender dysphoria do not cause ‘sterilization,’” the lawsuit says. A Pentagon memo “misstates the medical evidence by conflating potential fertility impacts with sterilization. DoD then uses this conflation to categorically deny gender transition treatments to all transgender adolescents and young adults, despite the absence of individualized medical justification and despite the statute’s limited scope, which does not support such a broad application.”

The lawsuit also argues that the new health care policies violate the Administrative Procedure Act, which allows courts to block policies that are arbitrary or capricious.

The lawsuit was filed in federal district court in Maryland by GLBTQ Legal Advocates and Defenders, or GLAD Law, and National Center for LGBTQ Rights, or NCLR.

“This is a sweeping reversal of military health policy and a betrayal of military families who have sacrificed for our country,” Sarah Austin, staff attorney at GLAD Law, said in a statement. “When a service member is deployed and focused on the mission, they deserve to know their family is taken care of. This administration has backtracked on that core promise and put service members at risk of losing access to health care their children desperately need.”

The same pair of organizations is representing service members in a separate lawsuit against the Trump administration’s ban on transgender troops.

The restrictions on gender-affirmation health care are part of a broader effort by the Trump administration to erase transgender people from public life.

In addition to kicking out transgender troops and denying health care to transgender military kids, the administration has banned books about transgender people from Defense Department schools and ended gender-affirmation care at the Department of Veterans Affairs. Outside of military and veterans spheres, the administration has also tried to remove transgender people from the history of the Stonewall riots, blocked transgender people from changing the gender marker on their passports, and tried to force states to ban transgender women from competing in women’s sports.

Last week, Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth also posted on social media that he was firing a Navy doctor after Libs of TikTok, a conservative account focused on publicly shaming LGBTQ+ people, posted a screenshot of her LinkedIn page that said she provides transgender health care at a Navy hospital in California.

The nonprofit group American Oversight filed the suit in U.S. District Court last week. It challenges DOE’s effort to require individuals to re-confirm their interest in FOIA requests. In an August notice in the Federal Register, DOE announced that those with a FOIA request submitted prior to October 1, 2024, must email the agency within 30 days to keep the request open. American Oversight argues the move violates the law and would open the door for other agencies to sidestep their obligations under FOIA.

Extra money for IT modernization projects may be harder to come by next year. For a third year in a row, the House isn't giving any new funding to the Technology Modernization Fund. Lawmakers also are cutting two other federal IT modernization funding sources in 2026. The Financial Services and General Government appropriations bill includes $55 million for the Federal Citizen Services Fund, which would be a $20 million cut as compared to 2025. The bill also includes $10 million for the IT Oversight Reform Fund, $5 million of which would go to the Department of Government Efficiency. While the overall ITOR fund would increase by $2 million over 2025, the amount available for the federal CIO's office for IT projects would drop by $3 million.

By early November, the Defense Department must submit to the White House recommendations for what actions are required to permanently change the name of the Department of Defense to the Department of War. President Donald Trump signed an executive order Friday to begin the process to rebrand the DoD to DoW. The Pentagon already changed its website to war.gov from defense.gov. But Congress must sign off on the name change before it becomes official. Congressman Greg Steube (R-Fla) proposed legislation in the House to formally change the name of the department. Senators Rick Scott (R-Fla) and Mike Lee (R-Utah) are introducing companion legislation in the Senate.

Navy Secretary John Phelan is creating new leadership billets and a program office for robotic and autonomous systems. Phelan directed the creation of a deputy assistant secretary position, a program executive office and a portfolio acquisition executive for robotic and autonomous systems. He is also pausing all related acquisition and contracting actions for the next 30 days. Phelan will issue further direction on the “full implementation” of the new roles and offices in a month. He expects the offices to reach its initial operating capacity within the next 90 days.

The Defense Health Agency has rolled out a new online tool that allows users to search for DHA locations worldwide. Users can filter searches by defense health network, TRICARE region or keywords, and the interactive map makes it easy to find a location, link to a website or click to call. FindDHA is the latest addition to the public website the agency launched in 2024 as a collaboration between the agency's communications and public affairs division and the web and mobile technology management office.

More employees at the Environmental Protection Agency have been reprimanded for signing a letter of dissent last month. EPA leadership has just suspended many of the employees who signed a dissent letter earlier this year. The two-week suspension notices went out after a handful of other EPA employees were fired the week before. The suspended EPA employees are now awaiting the agency's final call on what comes next. The American Federation of Government Employees, which represents over 8000 EPA workers is urging the agency to reinstate all of the impacted employees.

A new audit is highlighting challenges with the federal cyber workforce. Agencies have limited data on the number of federal employees and contractors working on cybersecurity issues. That’s according to a new report from the Government Accountability Office. GAO says strengthening the cyber workforce is a critical challenge given threats to federal IT networks. But most agencies haven’t fully evaluated whether various cyber workforce initiatives are making a difference. GAO is recommending the Office of the National Cyber Director work more closely with agencies on strategic workforce issues.

“TFL coverage of these drugs isn’t authorized when obesity is the sole or major condition treated.
Q: Why does weight loss drug coverage differ between TFL and TRICARE Prime or TRICARE Select?
Federal law doesn’t TFL to cover weight loss medications when prescribed for weight loss as the sole or major condition.
Medicare Part D may cover certain weight loss medications for non-obesity conditions.","The Defense Health Agency recently announced it will implement existing regulatory controls regarding TRICARE coverage of weight loss medications, including Glucagon-Like Peptide 1 (GLP-1) drugs, to ensure prescription processing aligns with federal coverage requirements. You may have questions, such as:

Why do some plans cover these drugs while TRICARE For Life doesn’t?

Should I stop taking my medication if TFL doesn’t cover it?

Can I keep taking my prescription if I pay for it out of pocket?

“Many TFL beneficiaries have concerns about why some obesity treatments are covered and others aren’t,” said Edward C. Norton, Chief, Pharmacy Operations Division at the Defense Health Agency. “TFL coverage of these drugs isn’t authorized when obesity is the sole or major condition treated. Our goal is to help you understand the existing rules and how to explore options that still meet your needs.”

TFL offers Medicare wraparound coverage. It’s different from other TRICARE plan options, like TRICARE Prime or TRICARE Select.

Different laws govern TRICARE Prime and TRICARE Select. These laws allow the Department of Defense to offer certain additional preventive care services and health benefits when received from network providers under those plan options.

Q: Why does weight loss drug coverage differ between TFL and TRICARE Prime or TRICARE Select?

A: Federal law and regulation determine the differences.

Federal law doesn’t TFL to cover weight loss medications when prescribed for weight loss as the sole or major condition. This is true regardless of the patient's age.

Other than bariatric surgery, which is authorized for the treatment of morbid obesity, federal regulation only extends coverage for treatment of obesity for beneficiaries with TRICARE Prime or TRICARE Select benefits when provided by network providers.

Q: Why doesn't TFL follow Medicare's exceptions for sleep apnea and heart disease conditions?

A: TRICARE and Medicare operate under different legal frameworks with different coverage authorities. Medicare Part D may cover certain weight loss medications for non-obesity conditions. These may include sleep apnea or reducing cardiovascular risk.

TFL follows separate federal laws and regulations. These laws and regulations exclude medications intended to control or reduce weight. This is regardless of the existence of co-morbid conditions.

Q: Why does this feel sudden?

A: We understand this may feel abrupt. Express Scripts, the TRICARE Pharmacy Program contractor, mailed detailed notification letters to affected beneficiaries. These letters were mailed July 31, 2025 (30 days prior to the change).

If you are affected, you shouldn’t stop taking your medication right away. Ask your provider what’s most appropriate during this transition period.

Q: Which prior authorizations became invalid on Aug. 31?

A: Prior authorizations for obesity medications became invalid on Aug. 31 only for:

Those with TFL

Others not enrolled in TRICARE Prime, TRICARE Select, or premium-based plans (such as direct care only beneficiaries, foreign force members, or those with TRICARE Plus)

Q: I’m a TFL beneficiary. What happens if I try to fill my prescription after Aug. 31?

A: TRICARE will not cover your prescription. You can talk to your provider about other treatment options. Or you can prepare to pay for your prescription out of pocket.

Q: I have TFL and diabetes. Are my GLP-1 drugs still covered?

A: It depends. TRICARE covers certain GLP-1s for the treatment of type 2 diabetes. These include:

Ozempic

Trulicity

Mounjaro

Victoza

Coverage continues for all patients with a diagnosis of diabetes when prior authorization criteria are met. This is true regardless of their health plan.

And if you’re in federal service, you’ve got 31 days to apply, usually, with another carrier to be able to do that.
Terry Gerton Are there some key considerations that people should be thinking about as they think about adequate protection?
Now they take all the federal military retirees and throw us in with all the federal workers in the Federal Employees Dental and Vision Insurance Program.
Terry Gerton Well, speaking of that, as people start to think about transitioning, whether it’s for military service or federal service, what’s the first step you recommend that they take?","Terry Gerton You know, summer is sort of a season of transition, not just for military members, but this year for a lot of federal employees who might be facing downsizing or retirement or career shifts. Let’s walk through some of the things that people should be thinking about as they prepare for these changes. Maybe start with life insurance. What should folks be thinking about if they’re getting out of the military or if they are getting out of federal government?

Mike Meese Well, it’s very important that they think about that in terms of protecting their family. While you’re in federal government service, in most cases you’re covered by the Federal Employees’ Government Life Insurance. If you’re in the military, it’s Servicemembers’ Group Life Insurance. But you lose that when you leave either federal service or government service. And if you’re in federal service, you’ve got 31 days to apply, usually, with another carrier to be able to do that. You don’t get the government subsidy so it’s more expensive. Similar for service members, you can get VGLI [(Veterans’ Group Life Insurance)]. In both of those cases, whenever you do one of those transitions, it’s important to shop around, look at other potential providers. In our case, Armed Forces Mutual provides life insurance for the military and veterans [and] is a great place to start to be sure that you’re getting the adequate protection for your family at the right price.

Terry Gerton Are there some key considerations that people should be thinking about as they think about adequate protection?

Mike Meese Yes, you want to try to do an assessment of what your family would be dependent upon to be able to take care of all of the normal daily needs, as well as if you’ve got young children at home, putting them through college. All of the kinds of things that you had hoped to earn through your career, if your career is unexpectedly stopped because you die. You don’t want your family to either be destitute on the day-to-day things or not be able to fulfill all the expectations. So for most people, we end up finding $500,000, $800,000, even a million dollars worth of coverage is important.

Terry Gerton Well, and you don’t want to be trying to make those decisions while you’re in the middle of transition, right? Thinking early and shopping around early is the best approach here.

Mike Meese Exactly. That’s very important. And if you’re in the military and trying to get a VA disability rating, you want to get that life insurance before all your retirement physicals, because that may identify something that you did not know was necessarily wrong with you. You, of course, would disclose that on a life insurance application. But if you don’t know that you have that kind of illness, then you don’t put that on the application.

Terry Gerton Well, that’s an important caution. And it brings up another question around medical care. Folks who are in the government have access to subsidized health insurance. Folks in the military have full health insurance. What should people be thinking about as they’re preparing to step away from that full coverage?

Mike Meese The same kinds of things. What kind of coverage are you going to have? If you’re retiring, then you can go into TRICARE for retirees if you’re in the military, or the federal benefit program for retirees. If you are not retiring, it’s important for you to determine, where am I going to get my source of health care? Is that from the spouse’s employment, because sometimes your spouse will have health care coverage for the family? Or are you going to take a look at continuing the current coverage that you have from your employer through paying it yourself or going on to one of the health care exchanges? It’s a very complicated process. You want to start that early as you begin your transition.

Terry Gerton And it’s important to remember that dental and vision aren’t always included in those programs, right?

Mike Meese No, exactly, and they are usually not subsidized. So for example, there used to be a TRICARE retiree dental program that was taken away about 10 or 12 years ago. Now they take all the federal military retirees and throw us in with all the federal workers in the Federal Employees Dental and Vision Insurance Program. It’s organized by the federal government, but not substantially subsidized by the federal government. So you want to look very carefully at exactly what your needs are.

Terry Gerton I’m speaking with Mike Meese. He serves as the president of Armed Forces Mutual. Well, Mike, let’s shift gears a little bit. Let’s talk about education and training because the job market is such now that it could be really difficult without some retraining or additional education to find a new fit. What sort of benefits should people be looking into there?

Mike Meese Well, again, for veterans, you’re eligible for the Veterans Readiness and Employment. It used to be called Vocational Rehabilitation and Employment, but it’s Chapter 31 benefits — up to 48 months of training, which you could get even if you have left service, maybe went to the federal government and then have left, as long as it’s within 12 years of your date of discharge from the military. If you have a disability that affects your ability to work, the Veterans Readiness and Employment is something that you may want to consider. You’d want to consider that first before looking at the other benefits such as the Post-9/11 GI Bill benefits, because if you use the Veterans Readiness and Employment first, then the Post-9/11 GA Bill benefits may still be eligible for your children.

Terry Gerton Can you talk a little bit about the transferability of the GI Bill?

Mike Meese Yeah, that’s one of the most advantageous things that happened after 9/11 is they allowed you to, if you earn post-9//11 GI Bill benefits, that’s up to 36 months of benefits. So basically, four years of nine months at school, you can transfer that to your children, eligible dependents or to your spouse and they can use those benefits. In my case, I had two daughters, I gave 18 months to each of them. And not only did they get tuition at, in their cases, University of Connecticut, George Mason University, but they were also able to get the basic allowance for housing for an E-5 in the military. And that helped defray the food and dormitory costs when they were in college.

Terry Gerton Sounds like a great opportunity. And you mentioned that it’s transferable to family members. So spouses, it could apply to spouses as well.

Mike Meese It also can apply to spouses, and a few tips on that. Children have to use it before age 26. So you could even use it if they got a scholarship for college and they were under 26, they could use that for graduate school, for example. The other thing is, you want to transfer at least one month to each child and maybe one month to your spouse. That way, in my case, those two, my two daughters, just the way semesters broke, ended up with four and a half months left over. And they’re over 26. They’re not going to be able to use it. The only one left, I may have to go back and take an art class or something to be to take advantage of all those Post-9/11 GI Bill benefits. Had I transferred it to my spouse, she would have been able to use that.

Terry Gerton Well, one more topic then that people can be thinking about as they’re preparing for transition is financial readiness. We’ve talked in the past about financial literacy, but what about financial readiness? How do people evaluate where they are, and what should they be thinking about?

Mike Meese Well, the important thing is you need to be situationally aware and know what your income is, what your expenses are and what your net worth is. As we take a look at it, budgeting is critically important. And when we are working with people that are transitioning out of the military or out of federal civilian service, they don’t know what their income is going to be. But frequently, what they should know is, how much do I need to live off of? In other words, what are my expenses? You’d be surprised how many people just don’t know where all the money goes and what is discretionary, what is absolutely essential. And once we identify, hey, I need this amount of money to live on each month, we recommend, especially as you’re going through a transition, that you have at least six to eight months of those expenses. Especially the ones that you absolutely need to pay, like a mortgage, like food, like car insurance, that you want to be able to have eight months of expenses so that you don’t either go into debt or have to immediately take that first job that’s available just to be able to make ends meet.

Terry Gerton And what are some of the surprising things that people come across as they begin to build that budget?

Mike Meese It’s amazing how much the transportation costs are, because if you were in federal government service or if you lived on post, you probably didn’t drive very far. Even things like gym memberships. Those people that are in the military, you not only don’t have to pay for gym memberships, but usually your first sergeant is your personal trainer that gets you up at six in the morning to be able to do PT every day. When you have those kinds of expenses, uniform expenses, clothing expenses, all of those kinds of things tend to add up quite quickly. In addition to, as we mentioned, medical and dental insurance and those kinds of things. So that’s why, definitely be prepared before you enter one of these transitions.

Terry Gerton Well, speaking of that, as people start to think about transitioning, whether it’s for military service or federal service, what’s the first step you recommend that they take?",https://federalnewsnetwork.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/GettyImages-1367623947.jpg,N,0.0,2025-09-08 17:56:29.903702

84% Have Other Insurance: RAND Says VA Must Curb Duplicate Spending

Veterans aren’t short on coverage — and that’s the problem. A new analysis from the RAND Epstein Family Veterans Policy Research Institute finds that about 84% of the 8.2 million veterans enrolled in VA health care also carry another form of coverage (Medicare, TRICARE, Medicaid, or private insurance). RAND’s researchers say that much overlap “raises questions about whether different programs are making duplicative payments for the same care.”

This lands just as the VA and Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) opened a data-matching partnership that already flagged $106 million in duplicate provider payments over six years — money both agencies say they’re moving to recover. VA News And while that’s a start, outside experts say meaningful fixes require better record-keeping and tighter tracking across all the systems veterans use.

What’s Actually Going Wrong?

Siloed systems. VA is a care provider and payer; Medicare and TRICARE are insurers. They don’t act as each other’s secondary payer, which means the same veteran can touch multiple systems without a single source of truth on who should pay.

Overlapping bills. Providers sometimes bill both VA community care and Medicare for the same encounter — hence that $106M figure and the new VA–CMS data match.

Medicare Advantage incentives. Separate investigations show the government often pays Medicare Advantage plans for veterans who still rely heavily on VA care — another flavor of double-spend risk.

Why This Matters …

Every duplicate dollar is a dollar not spent on you. Waste drains resources from claims processing, specialty clinics, prosthetics, mental health, and toxic-exposure care — the lifelines our community depends on.

Continuity of care suffers. When agencies don’t see the full picture, authorizations, referrals, and reimbursements get messy — translating into canceled appointments or surprise bills.

Policy choices flow from data. RAND’s bottom line is clear: better data integration (VHA + Medicare + TRICARE + private claims) is needed to stop paying twice and to steer veterans to the right door faster.

What RAND (and Others) Recommend

Integrate claims data across payers. Use Medicare, TRICARE, Medicaid, and private-plan claims alongside VA enrollment/utilization data to see where care actually happened — and who should pay.

Educate veterans on coverage interactions. Clearer guidance on when to use VHA, community care, Medicare/MA, or private plans reduces accidental double billing.

Sustain the VA–CMS data-matching push. Early findings show it works; scaling it can prevent new overpayments instead of chasing them later.

What You Can Do Right Now …

Check your explanations of benefits (EOBs). If you use VA community care and also have Medicare or a private plan, scan EOBs for the same date of service showing up twice. If it looks wrong, report it to your VA community care office. (The VA has provider-billing guidance and audit processes in place.)

Tell providers up front. Hand them your VA authorization (for community care) and make it crystal-clear not to bill Medicare for that visit. This reduces “we billed both to be safe” misfires.

If you’re on Medicare Advantage, ask questions. Clarify how your MA plan interacts with VA care and prescriptions so you don’t pay premiums for benefits you rarely use — and so taxpayers aren’t paying twice.

Final thoughts …

Cutting waste isn’t anti-veteran — it’s pro-veteran. The 84% overlap is reality; the solution is smarter data, clearer rules, and consistent education, not finger-pointing. If VA, CMS, TRICARE, and private insurers pull in the same direction, the dollars saved can be redirected to what matters: faster decisions, steadier staffing, and better care for disabled veterans.

“This is a sweeping reversal of military health policy and a betrayal of military families who have sacrificed for our country” – Sarah Austin, GLAD Law

Three military families are challenging an abrupt reversal of Department of Defense policy, which now prohibits military clinics and hospitals from providing continuing medical care for their transgender adolescent and adult children. The new policy also prohibits TRICARE, the military insurance plan, from covering the costs of care for both transgender youth and young adults no matter where it is received.

Servicemembers, including the plaintiff families, have been able to obtain medical care for their transgender children through the military health system for nearly a decade. This spring, President Trump ordered the Department of Defense to terminate this essential care.

As a result of the Trump administration’s directive, the families’ trusted doctors cannot provide ongoing care and families are unfairly forced to take on this financial burden.

The case, Doe v. Department of Defense, was filed in the U.S. District Court for the District of Maryland. The plaintiffs are proceeding with pseudonyms for the safety and privacy of their families. They are represented by GLBTQ Legal Advocates & Defenders (GLAD Law), National Center for LGBTQ Rights (NCLR), Brown Goldstein & Levy, LLP, and Keker, Van Nest & Peters LLP.

“This is a sweeping reversal of military health policy and a betrayal of military families who have sacrificed for our country,” said Sarah Austin, Staff Attorney at GLAD Law. “When a servicemember is deployed and focused on the mission they deserve to know their family is taken care of. This Administration has backtracked on that core promise and put servicemembers at risk of losing access to health care their children desperately need.”

“President Trump has illegally overstepped his authority by abruptly cutting off necessary medical care for military families,” Shannon Minter, Legal Director at NCLR. “This lawless directive is part of a dangerous pattern of this administration ignoring legal requirements and abandoning our servicemembers.”

“President Trump’s Executive Order blocks military hospitals from giving transgender youth the care their doctors deem necessary and their parents have approved,” said Sharif Jacob, partner at Keker, Van Nest & Peters LLP. “Today we filed a lawsuit to put an end to his order, and the agency guidance implementing it.”

“This administration is unlawfully targeting military families by denying essential care to their transgender children,” said Liam Brown, an associate with Keker, Van Nest & Peters. “We will not stand by while those who serve are stripped of the ability to care for their families.”

The Trump administration has waged a relentless assault on transgender Americans, issuing a barrage of discriminatory executive orders—now facing multiple federal lawsuits—designed to strip away their basic legal rights and deny them any legal recognition.

In the largest US-based pure MLN cohort reported, achieving a complete remission or reducing urine protein-to-creatinine ratio (UPCR) to less than 1 g/g within 1 year of diagnosis correlated with lower odds of doubling of serum creatinine (Scr) during extended follow-up, Stephen Olson, MD, of Walter Reed National Military Medical Center in Bethesda, Maryland, and colleagues reported.

Among 105 patients diagnosed with pure MLN in the 2004-2022 US Military Health System followed for a mean of 110 months, 16% experienced Scr doubling. At baseline, Scr was 1.27 vs 0.89 mg/dL in those with vs without Scr doubling. Patients who experienced Scr doubling were significantly more likely to have hypertension (50% vs 20.3%; P =.044), acute kidney injury (38.5% vs 11.9%; P =.018), or low complement C3 levels (73.3% vs 41.4%; P =.025) at diagnosis. This subgroup also had a lower mean baseline estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR; 72.6 vs 97.0 mL/min/1.73 m²; P =.004), but proteinuria at diagnosis did not differ significantly between groups.

Clinical course diverged substantially depending on remission status. Patients without Scr doubling were significantly more likely to achieve complete remission (55.6% vs 7.7%; P =.002), UPCR less than 1 g/g (81.3% vs 33.3%; P =.001), or UPCR less than 0.5 g/g (59.4% vs 8.3%; P =.001) within 1 year of diagnosis. Partial remission was not protective. Complete remission was defined as UPCR less than 0.5 g/g and eGFR within 15% of baseline within 1 year of treatment initiation. Partial remission was defined as reduction in UPCR by 50% to at least less than 3 g/g, and eGFR within 15% of baseline.

In contrast, patients who experienced Scr doubling were significantly more likely to progress to proliferative lupus nephritis (18.8% vs 3.5%; P =.018), develop end-stage kidney disease (25% vs 0%; P <.001), or die (6.3% vs 0%; P =.021).

Kaplan-Meier analysis reinforced that Scr doubling-free survival was higher in patients achieving complete remission, UPCR less than 1 g/g, or UPCR less than 0.5 g/g. Multivariable logistic regression confirmed these protective effects after adjusting for age, race, and baseline renal function.

Complete remission (OR, 0.08; 95% CI, 0.01-0.75), UPCR less than 1 g/g (OR, 0.13; 95% CI, 0.03-0.59), and UPCR less than 0.5 g/g (OR, 0.08; 95% CI, 0.01-0.69) at 1 year were each significantly associated with decreased odds of Scr doubling, even after adjustment for immunosuppressive treatment.

No differences in renal outcomes were observed by histopathology. The investigators could not determine individual effects of therapeutic agents likely due to the small sample size.

These results highlight the prognostic value of remission and proteinuria reduction as therapeutic benchmarks in pure MLN. While the retrospective design and modest sample size are study limitations, this analysis provides much-needed clarity on long-term outcomes in MLN, a subgroup often underrepresented in lupus nephritis research. Notably, patients were not censored at the time of transitioning from MLN to proliferative disease.

“Overall, our study provides data to better assess prognosis at MLN diagnosis and suggests that patients with MLN should receive treatment with the minimal goal of achieving less than 1 gm proteinuria, if not a [complete response],” Dr Olson’s team concluded. “Future MLN specific trials are required to determine the optimal treatment strategy to achieve this goal.”",https://www.renalandurologynews.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/22/2024/12/Renal-Urology.png,N,0.0,2025-09-08 13:56:25.378710

“We play a combat support role at AFHSD, and we are responsible for protecting the Joint Force,” said Navy Capt. Richard Langton, chief of AFHSD. “We carry out our assigned duties through retrospective, near real-time, and prospective health surveillance — in a nutshell, full-spectrum health surveillance.”

AFHSD is a public health component of the DHA and the U.S. military’s central public health entity. The division focuses on global health surveillance, providing operational forces with early warning, health threat assessments, and force-readiness data.

The division is organized into three branches: Epidemiology and Analysis, Global Emerging Infections Surveillance, and Integrated Biosurveillance.

AFHSD is the central repository of medical surveillance data for the armed forces. This is done through technical infrastructure, expertise in database management for the Defense Medical Surveillance System and related applications, and operations, and management of the Department of Defense Serum Repository.

The DMSS houses current and historical data on diseases and medical events. These include hospitalizations, ambulatory visits, reportable medical events, laboratory tests, immunizations, periodic and deployment-related health assessments, and casualty data affecting service members throughout their military careers. It contains billions of data records on service members and other Military Health System beneficiaries.

Leveraging data to manage seasonal respiratory illnesses

The AFHSD uses this wealth of data to analyze and anticipate potential threats.

“AFHSD plays a key role in integrating biosurveillance efforts by collecting data and information in near real-time of the threats from endemic diseases and emerging infectious diseases relevant to the military worldwide,” said Juan I. Ubiera, chief of the IB branch. “IB also conducts forecasting analytics to predict and communicate seasonal respiratory illnesses threats.”

This surveillance information enables weekly trend analysis and situation reports on seasonal respiratory illnesses. It also includes a report on respiratory illness activity on and around selected installations, to assist senior leaders in making decisions regarding resource and personnel distribution.

IB also supports early warnings and monitoring of various syndromes, including respiratory illnesses at military hospitals and clinics, communicated through the Electronic Surveillance System for the Early Notification of Community Based Epidemics, or ESSENCE. This program, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, allows public health professionals to analyze events of public health interest, monitor health care data for events that could affect public health, and share data and analyses.

Raising awareness with the Medical Surveillance Monthly Report

The AFHSD disseminates important biosurveillance information through a peer-reviewed journal, the Medical Surveillance Monthly Report.

“The MSMR publishes summaries of notifiable diseases, trends of illnesses of special interest, and field reports describing outbreaks and case occurrences,” said Shauna Stahlman, senior epidemiologist in the E&A branch.

“Launched in 1995, the journal provides evidence-based estimates of the incidence, distribution, impact, and trends of illness and injuries among U.S. military service members and associated populations,” she said.

According to Stahlman, the MSMR publishes “pertinent articles on military public health, epidemiology, surveillance, and disease and injury prevention, continuously evaluating manuscript submissions for scientific accuracy.”

“The journal reports present data, public health information, and original research with direct relevance to the operational fitness of military members or MHS beneficiaries' health, safety, and well-being,” she added.

Future of biosurveillance

Each branch has specific goals in their continuing efforts to meet the needs of service members and other MHS beneficiaries.

“The E&A branch’s goal is to be flexible, responsive, and predictive to our customers by releasing accurate, timely, and actionable surveillance data, and leveraging partnerships and networks within and outside of DHA public health to better predict and respond to their needs,” said Stahlman.

“In addition, we also aim to reduce the spread of medical misinformation and disinformation, which were identified as potential vulnerabilities for biodefense in the 2023 Biodefense Posture Review,” she noted.

The GEIS branch is expanding capabilities for pathogen-agnostic genomic sequencing, a method for detecting unknown pathogens to determine the cause of an illness, and wastewater surveillance, said June Early, deputy chief of the GEIS branch. “The future development, implementation, and expansion of these capabilities will enable a more comprehensive understanding of infectious disease threats.”

“Also, our respiratory infections focus area oversees the coordination of the DOD global influenza vaccine effectiveness analysis,” said Early. “These analyses directly inform selection and composition of the following season’s northern hemisphere influenza vaccine.”

The IB branch is enhancing biosurveillance early warning content and information dissemination on the Health Surveillance Explorer, the DHA’s mapping application that provides near real-time integrated global health surveillance information for force health protection.

“We are increasing syndromic surveillance capabilities through collaborative partnerships with additional states,” said Ubiera. “IB is working with combatant commands and services to provide tailored biosurveillance information. We are also working to expand global biosurveillance capabilities by working with partner nations and allies to exchange information. This is one of the reform initiatives established in the 2023 Biodefense Posture Review.”

Capturing the high ground in health surveillance

Military public health surveillance is vital in detecting and mitigating emerging health threats, Langton said.

“We’re very proud of the capabilities we already bring to the fight. But future success requires us to move beyond the current state,” he said. “The task before us is to capture the high ground in health surveillance. We are meeting that head-on by adopting new capabilities and tapping into the unique capabilities of our partners to create synergies that endure and allow us to dominate the health surveillance space.”",https://d1ldvf68ux039x.cloudfront.net/thumbs/photos/2308/7999800/1000w_q95.jpg,N,0.0,2025-09-08 13:56:29.916144

74 additional supported living units

44 residential aged care beds

New communal facilities, including an indoor pool and bowls green

Bill S. 2239, titled the ""Improving Access to Prenatal Care for Military Families Act,"" proposes the establishment of a pilot program by the Department of Defense to treat pregnancy as a qualifying event for enrollment in TRICARE Select. This legislative proposal aims to facilitate better access to health care services for military families by offering an inclusive framework for enrollment driven by the occurrence of pregnancy.

[b]Main Focus and Key Objectives[/b]

The central objective of the Bill is to provide a mechanism that allows eligible beneficiaries to enroll in TRICARE Select during pregnancy, categorized as a qualifying event. The proposal underlines the need to adapt healthcare benefits to the specific needs of military personnel and their families, thus enhancing prenatal care access. The Bill signifies a commitment to supporting military families by recognizing pregnancy as an important trigger for healthcare enrollment adjustments.

[b]Pilot Program Establishment[/b]

The Bill mandates the commencement of a five-year pilot program not later than 180 days after its enactment. Under this program, the Secretary of Defense is instructed to treat pregnancy as a qualifying event as outlined in section 1099(b)(1)(B) of Title 10, United States Code. This provision applies to TRICARE Select enrollment by an eligible beneficiary, aiming to streamline and facilitate access to necessary prenatal healthcare services.

[b]Initial Briefing and Reporting Requirements[/b]

Within one year after enacting the Bill, the Secretary of Defense is required to deliver a briefing to the appropriate congressional committees regarding the status of the pilot program. This ensures continuous oversight and evaluation of the program's implementation and efficacy. Subsequently, an annual report is mandated, with the first submission due one year after the program's commencement. These reports will provide data on enrollment changes influenced by the pilot program, with disaggregated statistics by month and specific circumstances leading to such changes, including pregnancy as a qualifying event.

[b]Definitions and Relevant Terms[/b]

The Bill includes clear definitions of terms vital to the understanding and implementation of its provisions. ""Active duty"" follows the meaning set forth in section 101(d) of Title 10, United States Code. ""Appropriate congressional committees"" encompass the Committee on Armed Services of both the Senate and House, in addition to other relevant committees in the House of Representatives. The terms ""covered enrollment change,"" ""dependent,"" ""TRICARE Select,"" ""eligible beneficiary,"" and ""uniformed services"" are also defined according to the United States Code.

[b]Noteworthy Provisions[/b]

A significant aspect of the Bill is its emphasis on treating pregnancy as a notable qualifying event for health coverage adjustments, addressing potential barriers to timely access to prenatal care for the military community. The proposed pilot program serves as both an innovative and responsive measure to the unique demands faced by those serving in the armed forces and their dependents. Through systematic reporting and oversight, the Bill ensures that informed decisions are made regarding the future of such healthcare initiatives.

This Bill engages actively with the need to improve health care accessibility for military families, placing particular importance on adaptability to personal circumstances like pregnancy, thus reflecting a comprehensive approach to personnel welfare and family support within the military framework....",Not Available,"https://4a4c3a29ba9d1a23d3f6651fb46d2f54.cdn.bubble.io/cdn-cgi/image/w=,h=,f=auto,dpr=1,fit=contain/f1708896951335x142739689930226020/CodifyLogo1.png",N,0.0,2025-09-08 12:56:15.493741

There is increasing evidence on regional variations in U.S. Medicare utilization based on older patients who move. Yet evidence is limited for younger ages in the U.S., and movers may differ systematically from those who don’t move. In this paper, we harness the mandatory migration of military personnel and dependents (age 5 to 64) to estimate supply and demand factors in a system of care in which military physicians are salaried and copayments and deductibles are negligible. In our sample of 3 million enrollees, we find that place or supply effects explain as much as 80 percent of the overall regional variation for both the entire sample and for active-duty personnel. These regional place effects are correlated across age groups, with correlations as high as 0.84 between middle-aged and older military enrollees.

He emphasized the importance of delivering high-quality medical care to those who we serve.

“We’re here to support the warfighter, and I don’t think there’s a place that could embody that more than Fort Bragg,” said Ferrara. Fort Bragg is one of the largest U.S. military installations in the world with more than 50,000 service members assigned.

As the principal medical advisor to the Secretary of Defense and the Undersecretary of Defense for Personnel and Readiness, Ferrara oversees health policy, programs, and force health protection across the MHS. Since his appointment to his position on Jan. 20, he has been visiting and touring military medical facilities to collect firsthand feedback to understand local issues and successes, which helps him advocate for the staff and resources needed.

During the visit, he met with key leaders, department chiefs and toured various medical units to gain a deeper understanding of the unique aspects of WAMC’s mission and the challenges faced by health care providers in the field. Ferrara also presented coins to several individuals who have played a vital role in WAMC’s success, recognizing their dedication and hard work.

At a town hall with Womack staff, he emphasized that one of the most important parts of his job is being the voice of healthcare providers and personnel.

“What makes the Military Health System unique is there are many great health care systems in America, but we’re the only American healthcare system that goes to war,” he said. This means a high level of readiness is required for medical forces supporting both deployed personnel and their families with high-quality care.

“I’m your voice,” Ferrara said. “When I’m advising up, its essential to have that kind of understanding, to hear from people that do the work. The reason we're doing all that is not only to help our beneficiaries by taking care of them, but it's to maintain our readiness.”

Ferrara also emphasized the importance of collaboration between the Department of Defense and Department of Veterans Affairs. “We’re working together more closely than ever before, and that’s going to lead to better care for our veterans and our beneficiaries.”

“By taking care of veterans, we’re not only improving their health outcomes, but were also improving readiness and generating revenue for our military treatment facilities,” Ferrara explained.

The Military Health System is committed to delivering high-quality medical care to warfighters and their families ensuring their wellbeing and supporting their service.
