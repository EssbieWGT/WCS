The OPMED team also worked to broaden the exposure of the Tropical Fever Panel (TFP), a key component of the Defense Health Agency (DHA) Rapid Human Diagnostics (RHD) program.
Prior to integration into the BK25 exercise, the OPMED team conducted initial training for the Bridge Support Medical Company at Schofield Barracks in Hawaii in January 2025.
According to Rooney, these training efforts were aimed at enhancing user familiarity with the operational capabilities of the MPDS, particularly focusing on diagnostic procedures for tropical fevers.
Beyond training and integration, the OPMED team also engaged with other units and stakeholders participating in BK25, including Australian and Filipino forces.","Team members from the Operational Medical Systems Program Management Office (OPMED PMO) participated in Exercise Balikatan 2025 (BK 25) in the Philippines, April 21 to May 9, 2025. This annual exercise, a cornerstone of the alliance between the Armed Forces of the Philippines and the U.S. military, aims to bolster bilateral interoperability, capabilities, trust, and cooperation built on decades of shared experience.

BK 25 saw a significant focus on enhancing medical capabilities in tropical environments, offering OPMED the opportunity to provide crucial support to the 18th Theater Medical Command during the integration of the Man-Portable Diagnostic System (MPDS). Designed for rapid identification of infectious diseases in austere environments, the MPDS has the potential to significantly improve the well-being of troops deployed in remote locations while allowing faster return to duty for Warfighters. The OPMED team also worked to broaden the exposure of the Tropical Fever Panel (TFP), a key component of the Defense Health Agency (DHA) Rapid Human Diagnostics (RHD) program.

For Calli Rooney and Shannon Gupta, product managers with OPMED’s Warfighter Protection and Acute Care project management office, the primary objective was to assist the 18th TMC with integrating the diagnostic system into the BK25 experimentation event, focusing on obtaining user feedback and gaining a deeper understanding of the capability's use and effectiveness in operational environments.

The team successfully integrated the MPDS and TFP into Role 2 (forward support) and Role 2 Enhanced (stabilization) medical roles of care during BK25. Role 2 was supported by Charlie Medical Company of the 225 Logistics Support Brigade, 25th Infantry Division, while the Role 2E was supported by the 147th Field Hospital (FH). Combined Joint medical teams provided critical user feedback on the performance and usability of the MPDS and TFP and its impact on diagnostic capabilities.

The TFP consistently outperformed traditional diagnostic methods, offering faster and more precise diagnoses, according to Rooney. Its ease of use and portability were also highlighted, making it suitable for deployment in diverse settings ranging from established field hospitals to austere, remote clinics.

Over the course of the exercise, participating units successfully performed nearly 100 TFP tests across three devices for 10 consecutive days. Users submitted over 85 surveys containing invaluable user feedback. The operational environments observed at the Role 2 and Role 2E sites at Fort Roman Magsaysay, the largest military reservation in the Philippines, accurately mirrored potential deployed situations in tropical and subtropical environments, including exposure to rain, extreme heat, high humidity, and dust. Despite these challenges, no safety concerns were observed related to the MPDS device or TFP testing, and the devices remained operational.

Prior to integration into the BK25 exercise, the OPMED team conducted initial training for the Bridge Support Medical Company at Schofield Barracks in Hawaii in January 2025. According to Rooney, these training efforts were aimed at enhancing user familiarity with the operational capabilities of the MPDS, particularly focusing on diagnostic procedures for tropical fevers.

""The initial training in Hawaii proved invaluable,"" she said. ""The 25th ID was able to quickly initiate operations and testing during BK25. When a technical issue arose, we were able to work with the vendor to identify and implement a solution within 24 hours.""

Role 2E FH units received onsite training at Fort Ramon Magsaysay at the start of BK25 experimentation. Following the initial setup, the team focused on providing hands-on instruction, from system setup to running controls and patient samples.

To gather comprehensive feedback, surveys set up by the 18th TMC and Medical Capability Development and Integration Directorate, in collaboration with the OPMED team, were distributed to units at Role 2 and Role 2E sites, enabling real-time data collection on the functionality and operation of the MPDS and TFP capabilities. That feedback will be instrumental in further refining and improving the DHA RHD program and its contribution to ensuring the health and well-being of military personnel in diverse operational environments, according to Gupta.

""Our team’s presence in the field was critical,"" she said. ""Without it, the integration would not have been as successful. The 18th TMC's Experimentation Team has a broad focus, and we were able to provide the dedicated support needed for this specific capability.""

Beyond training and integration, the OPMED team also engaged with other units and stakeholders participating in BK25, including Australian and Filipino forces. Rooney and Gupta briefed the United States Army Pacific Concepts team, demonstrating the capability and answering questions regarding its intended use. This led to discussions about increased integration into future exercises with expanded functionality. Other medical personnel, including representatives from Air Force Special Forces and the Navy, expressed interest in the MPDS for various applications.

Development of this far forward rapid diagnostics capability is a collaborative effort involving multiple DoD and commercial partners, according to Rooney. OPMED manages the development of the TFP, while the Joint Program Executive Office for Chemical, Biological, Radiological, and Nuclear Defense leads the development of the MPDS. Both leverage technology developed by Cepheid, Inc.

Information gathered from the BK25 event is crucial for refining the MPDS capability, optimizing its integration into future joint exercises, and supporting fielding in operational environments, according to Rooney. This user-centric feedback will drive ongoing development efforts, ensuring the MPDS and TFP meet the evolving needs of medical personnel in the field.

“We are dedicated to continuously improving our capabilities based on real-world feedback from the Warfighter,” she said. “Insights gained from the Balikatan exercise will be instrumental in enhancing the use of the MPDS device and ensuring its effectiveness in future operations.”

OPMED, part of the Defense Health Agency, is the DoD’s leading force in medical development and acquisition, focused on enhancing Warfighter lethality and readiness. Project managers with the team develop and deliver next-generation, world-class medical capabilities that empower combatant commanders for Large-Scale Combat Operations, particularly within austere environments, with a twofold mission: save lives on the battlefield and swiftly return injured service members to duty.",https://d1ldvf68ux039x.cloudfront.net/thumbs/photos/2506/9115509/1000w_q95.jpg,N,1.0,2025-06-16 13:56:15.316608

But you said nothing about regular VA healthcare. If a non-career veteran is eligible for VA healthcare, couldn’t that be used in place of Medicare? Signed: Veteran Advocate

Dear Veteran Advocate: Thank you for your feedback. FYI, I have previously explained that veterans who rely on the VA for 100% of their healthcare can, indeed, disenroll from Medicare Part B (thus saving the monthly Part B premium). I don’t personally recommend it because of my personal experience, but it certainly is possible to do so.

Personally, I use the VA for some of my healthcare needs – usually an annual checkup and optometry services – at my local VA clinic which is only a mile away from where I live. But for any extensive treatment needs (medical tests, etc.) I must travel about 40 miles to the nearest VA hospital facility. For contrast, I have numerous private healthcare services, specialists, and hospitals very near where I live, but to use them under the VA I must get VA preapproval and use only certain VA-approved providers, which is inconvenient for me. Personally, I prefer the freedom to go to any healthcare service provider I choose, without restriction, at any time I need to. So, I use my VA coverage when it is convenient for me but rely also on non-VA, Medicare-approved specialists who I can choose to use (or not) at will. For me, it’s a matter of convenience and the freedom to use whichever healthcare provider I want. That said, I fully understand that some veterans rely exclusively on the VA for their healthcare needs, and I have explained to many who have written to me that they have that option. I have also published several public articles about this as well. Here is one such article:

So, please rest assured that we regularly advise our veterans about their healthcare options under Medicare, including the ability to decline Medicare Part B coverage if they have full VA healthcare coverage. FYI, free Medicare Part A (inpatient hospitalization coverage) is mandatory to collect Social Security after age 65, but Medicare Part B coverage is always optional because there is a premium associated with Part B. A veteran can decline Medicare Part B coverage and save that monthly premium, but they would need to contact Social Security to do so. Social Security will want to interview the veteran to ensure they are aware of the potential financial consequences of not having Medicare Part B. And they may need to file form CMS-1763 (Request for Termination) But a non-career veteran can opt out of Medicare Part B if they get all of their healthcare services through the Veterans Administration.",https://static-asset.amac.us/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/02095948/Ask-Rusty-0423.jpg,N,0.0,2025-06-16 11:56:29.245233

The letters are mailed to impacted beneficiaries by the pharmacy contractor at least 30 days prior to the formulary change.
Providers and beneficiaries can refer to the TRICARE Formulary Search Tool for information on tiered copay status and other requirements, including pre-authorization or quantity limits.
To alleviate beneficiary confusion and comments regarding TRICARE Formulary Change Beneficiary letters, the DHA created five letter templates for pre-authorization, step therapy, non-formulary, non-covered and OTC removal changes.
The beneficiaries are also provided with the link to the TRICARE Formulary Search Tool that provides more information on TRICARE covered drugs, including any restrictions and which provides any applicable pre-authorization forms.","The National Defense Authorization Act required the establishment of a Pharmacy & Therapeutics committee (P&T) for fiscal year 2000. Its purpose was to develop and maintain a Uniform Formulary of medications—a list of brand name and generic drugs and supplies that TRICARE covers—which provides pharmacy benefits in the outpatient setting.

The Department of Defense Pharmacy & Therapeutics committee meetings are held quarterly, with recommendations determining which medications are included on the Uniform Formulary based on clinical and cost-effectiveness of the agents. The DOD P&T committee recommendations are then discussed publicly with the Beneficiary Advisory Panel.

The Beneficiary Advisory Panel is comprised of nongovernmental organizations representing DOD beneficiaries, pharmacy contractors and TRICARE network providers. Federal law requires that the BAP review and comment on the DOD P&T committee recommendations for implementing formulary changes to Tier 3 status, pre-authorization criteria, and implementation periods. The BAP is unique in that it gives beneficiaries a voice about what medications are included on the formulary, while providing transparency to what is often an unpublicized process in other health systems. Following the BAP comments, the final formulary decisions are reviewed and signed by the director of the Defense Health Agency.

Beginning in October 2007, the DOD took measures to improve communication with beneficiaries concerning formulary changes. Among the new measures, patient-specific notification letters were mailed to beneficiaries impacted by a variety of formulary changes. Examples include an increase in the cost-share (Tier 3 status), and a change from a preferred to a non-preferred status, which can include, but is not limited to, new step therapy or pre-authorization requirements.

TRICARE added a limited number of OTC drugs to the formulary and made them available at all three points of service: military pharmacies, home delivery, and at retail network pharmacies. Additionally, a variety of OTC products are available only at military pharmacies. The DOD P&T committee reviews the OTC drug classes to determine which drugs should and should not be covered, and occasionally an OTC drug will be removed from the benefit, in which case affected beneficiaries are notified.

Working with several avenues for beneficiaries to submit questions and through different sources, including the pharmacy benefit manager contractor, DHA realized that individual letters describing the upcoming formulary changes required streamlining. The new individual letters describe the upcoming formulary change, lists options for formulary alternatives that the beneficiary and their doctor can consider, includes the associated copay information, and documents the implementation date for the associated change. The letters are mailed to impacted beneficiaries by the pharmacy contractor at least 30 days prior to the formulary change.

In 2018, the NDAA directed TRICARE to add a fourth “not covered” tier to its formulary, which excludes coverage of pharmaceutical agents that have little clinical effectiveness and aren’t cost effective. Similar to commercial pharmacy benefit plans, beneficiaries must pay the full out-of-pocket cost for these completely excluded drugs at retail network pharmacies and these agents aren’t available at military pharmacies or home delivery. The DOD P&T committee not only evaluates drugs for exclusion from coverage, but also identifies branded drugs that may be moved to Tier 1 (generic formulary) status with a lower copayment for beneficiaries. Providers and beneficiaries can refer to the TRICARE Formulary Search Tool for information on tiered copay status and other requirements, including pre-authorization or quantity limits.

To alleviate beneficiary confusion and comments regarding TRICARE Formulary Change Beneficiary letters, the DHA created five letter templates for pre-authorization, step therapy, non-formulary, non-covered and OTC removal changes. All new letters immediately begin with the date of change and impacted drug in bolded font so beneficiaries can easily know the important details up front. In addition, the letter outlines the reason for the formulary change. A separate letter is attached so that beneficiaries can share the information to review with their health care provider.

FALLS CHURCH, Virginia – The Defense Health Agency announced that TRICARE beneficiaries in six Kansas counties may receive emergency prescription refills now through June 19, due to flooding.

The counties affected are Butler, Chase, Coffey, Greenwood, Harvey, and Sedgwick.

To receive an emergency refill of prescription medications, TRICARE beneficiaries should take their prescription bottle to any TRICARE retail network pharmacy. If the bottle is unavailable or the label is damaged or missing, beneficiaries should contact Express Scripts, Inc., or their retail network pharmacy for assistance.

To find a network pharmacy, beneficiaries may call Express Scripts at 1-877-363-1303, or search the network pharmacy locator.

If possible, visit the pharmacy where the prescription was filled. Prescriptions filled by a retail chain may be filled at another store in that chain. If the clinician who prescribed the medication is available, beneficiaries can ask them to call in a new prescription to any network pharmacy.

As a reminder, TRICARE beneficiaries, other than active duty service members, may receive urgent care from any TRICARE-authorized urgent care center or provider and do not need a referral. This allows beneficiaries to seek nonemergency care for illnesses or injuries if their primary care provider is unavailable because of emergencies. Any TRICARE beneficiary who reasonably believes they have an emergency should always call 911 or, go to the nearest emergency room.

Beneficiaries are advised to visit Express Scripts’ Weather Notices page for updates.

Ghosh’s actions not only defrauded public health systems but also robbed women of their health, dignity, and future possibilities.","Mona Ghosh, a 52-year-old Indian-American gynaecologist based in Chicago, has been sentenced to 10 years in federal prison for a multi-million dollar healthcare fraud that endangered the health and fertility of her patients.

Between 2018 and 2022, Ghosh orchestrated a scheme involving false diagnoses, unnecessary and sometimes non-existent procedures, and fraudulent billing, pocketing over $2.4 million from federal health programmes and private insurers. The court has ordered her to pay $1.5 million in restitution, and she faces multiple civil lawsuits from affected patients.

A Web of Deceit: Patients Betrayed and Lives Altered

Dr Mona Ghosh operated Progressive Women’s Healthcare in Hoffman Estates, Illinois, where she built a reputation as a trusted OB-GYN, particularly among women from lower-income and minority backgrounds. However, investigations revealed a disturbing pattern: Ghosh routinely misdiagnosed patients with serious conditions such as cancer, pressuring them into undergoing aggressive, unnecessary procedures.

Many of these treatments, including endometrial ablations and biopsies, were not only unwarranted but also performed without proper consent, resulting in lasting physical and emotional trauma. Several women lost their fertility as a direct consequence. Former patient Socorro Urbano, who is now part of a civil lawsuit against Ghosh, stated, “She has altered lives indefinitely; it’s something you can’t take back.”

During sentencing, U.S. District Judge Franklin Valderrama condemned Ghosh’s actions, saying, “You irrevocably harmed women who put their trust in you. You used your patients to bankroll your luxurious lifestyle.” Ghosh’s medical license has been permanently revoked, and she is required to report to prison in September 2025.

How the Fraud Unfolded: Investigations and Legal Fallout

Federal prosecutors, with support from the FBI and the Department of Health and Human Services, uncovered that Ghosh’s scheme was both elaborate and systematic. She directed her staff to falsify patient records, exaggerate symptoms, and use incorrect billing codes to inflate insurance claims. The fraudulent activities targeted Medicaid, TRICARE, and private insurers, resulting in more than $2.4 million in illicit gains.

Investigators found that many procedures were either never performed or medically unnecessary, with some patients unaware that their medical records had been falsified. The trauma inflicted on patients was a key factor in the severity of Ghosh’s sentence.

In addition to the criminal case, nearly 100 former patients are pursuing civil lawsuits, seeking compensation for the physical and psychological harm they endured. The case has prompted calls for stricter oversight of private medical practices and more robust mechanisms for patients to report suspected malpractice.

The Logical Indian’s Perspective

The Mona Ghosh case is a tragic reminder of the sacred trust that must exist between doctors and their patients. When that trust is violated, the consequences can be devastating and lifelong. Ghosh’s actions not only defrauded public health systems but also robbed women of their health, dignity, and future possibilities.

This case underscores the urgent need for stronger regulatory frameworks, better patient education, and a healthcare culture rooted in empathy and accountability. As we reflect on this disturbing episode, we must ask: What more can be done to protect vulnerable patients and ensure that medical practitioners always put care before profit?",https://thelogicalindian.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Copy-of-Social-Thumbnail-Template-69.jpg,N,0.0,2025-06-14 05:56:19.303344

Here's our complete guide to everything you need to know about ABA therapy.","Applied Behavior Analysis (ABA) is a therapy rooted in the science of learning and behavior. Using principles of ABA, children and adults can learn to improve their communication skills, social skills, and daily living skills while also addressing problematic or challenging behaviors. The primary goal of ABA therapy is to teach helpful skills that promote independence and reduce harmful behaviors. Here's our complete guide to everything you need to know about ABA therapy.

It's a big decision to make for your family! Applied behavior analysis (ABA) seeks to improve communication skills, introduce productive habits, and reduce harmful behaviors. Watch out for ABA providers who look to ""cure"" autism.

High quality ABA therapy does exist where the goal is not to “fix” children, make them appear “less autistic”, or change who they are. The goal is to help people learn all that they can so they can live to their potential while embracing their unique, individual personality traits. Here's our complete guide to start and end ABA therapy.

ABA looks different from other therapy settings. Typically, ABA therapy occurs multiple times a week and can take place in the home, community, or in a clinic setting. Depending on your child's needs, you might need to commit up to 40 hours a week.

ABA therapy can last for a few months to a few years. During that time, children and their families are committed to training and learning together. Therapy ideally ends when children meet their goals. Check out our complete guide for how to start and end ABA therapy.

ABA is usually covered by insurance if you have an autism diagnosis. Autism is typically the only diagnosis insurance will authorize for ABA services since its benefits have been researched extensively.

Always check with your specific insurance plan to confirm that ABA is covered for your child’s diagnoses and that the provider you are seeking care at is in-network.

Operating out of her medical office, Progressive Women’s Healthcare in Hoffman Estates, Illinois, Dr. Ghosh submitted false claims to Medicaid, TRICARE, and private insurers between 2018 and 2022, billing for procedures that were either unnecessary or never performed.

Who is Mona Ghosh?

Dr. Ghosh was found guilty of submitting claims for a range of medical services, including endometrial ablations, biopsies, ultrasounds, vaccinations, blood tests, and STD screenings, many of which were either not performed or performed without patient consent. Additionally, she exaggerated the length and complexity of office and telemedicine visits, using incorrect billing codes to seek higher reimbursements.

Federal investigators also found that Dr. Ghosh fabricated patient records to support her fraudulent claims, further complicating her extensive scheme. The fraudulent actions not only resulted in stolen taxpayer money but also endangered the health of Ghosh’s patients. According to prosecutors, some of the unnecessary procedures performed by Ghosh limited patients’ ability to have children in the future. “Dr. Ghosh’s fraud scheme was particularly egregious because she endangered the health of her patients by performing unnecessary procedures,” said U.S. Attorney Andrew S. Boutros. “She not only stole taxpayer funds but also caused harm to those who trusted her with their health.”

Investigators’ remarks on the case

The scheme was uncovered through a joint investigation by the FBI, the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, and the Department of Defense, among others. FBI Special Agent-in-Charge Douglas S. DePodesta said, “The depraved conduct uncovered in this case represents an extreme betrayal of trust toward patients who were simply seeking care and integrity from their doctor.” Authorities emphasised the seriousness of medical fraud, especially when it comes to healthcare professionals exploiting vulnerable patients and defrauding taxpayer-funded health programs. In addition to her 10-year prison sentence, Dr. Ghosh has been ordered to pay approximately $1.5 million in restitution to cover the stolen funds.",https://www.financialexpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Copy-of-.-2025-06-13T215512.327.jpg,N,0.0,2025-06-13 23:56:21.095260
