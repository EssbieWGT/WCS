Understanding Who TRICARE Insurance Is

TRICARE is a healthcare program for military personnel, veterans, and their families. If you’re a service member, retiree, or dependent, you likely qualify for TRICARE. TRICARE covers a variety of medical services, including mental health and substance use treatment. Understanding your policy, including your deductible, premiums, coverage limits, exclusions, and claims process, can help you make informed choices.

Your plan may cover part or all of your stay at a TRICARE luxury drug rehab center. This gives you access to upscale rehabilitation services in a private rehab sanctuary setting. TRICARE insurance is one of many healthcare resources for veterans and active-duty families.

Who Qualifies as an Active-Duty Service Member for TRICARE Coverage?

To qualify as an active-duty service member for TRICARE coverage, you must be a member of the U.S. Armed Forces, including the Army, Coast Guard, Marine Corps, Air Force, or Navy. This includes both full-time active-duty personnel and those in active-duty status for specific periods.

Your eligibility for TRICARE extends to your dependents, including your spouse and children, providing them with health coverage while you are on active duty. TRICARE covers several options for healthcare for active-duty military, including comprehensive medical care, mental health services, and substance abuse treatment. If you’re serving full-time or on orders, you can access benefits that ensure your health and well-being are supported during your service.

TRICARE offers a variety of healthcare options for veterans, including coverage for medical care, mental health services, and treatment at a VIP recovery center.

Being a military family is rewarding in many ways, but it can also be challenging. The frequent moves and family separations can take a toll. When you have a family member with special needs, you may find you need additional support to thrive.

You’re not alone. Check out the information below to learn ways you can strengthen your family and get the support you deserve.

Understand Your TRICARE Benefits

TRICARE offers several services for beneficiaries with special needs under the basic TRICARE benefit, including applied behavior analysis, durable medical equipment, home health care, mental health care, and more. Some diagnoses may require health care services outside your current TRICARE coverage plan. In those situations, TRICARE offers Special Programs for certain health conditions, populations, or concerns.

Enroll in the Exceptional Family Member Program

If your spouse, child, or other dependent family member requires ongoing medical or educational services, enroll in the Exceptional Family Member Program (EFMP). Once enrolled, you will have access to a wide range of support and services. Here are some highlights:

Enrollment in EFMP ensures that your family members’ needs are considered during the assignment process.

The EFMP & Me Online tool provides checklists, resources, and referrals to guide you through the Department of Defense’s network of services and support. For example, you can create a checklist to guide you through your child care search or to help you navigate financial planning for your loved one. Each checklist can be expanded to display related tasks, tips, and other resources.

Your EFMP Family Support provider can share information, resources, and support to help you navigate systems of care by providing referrals and ways to bridge gaps and connect you with local resources.

Build a Support Network

Having a family member with special needs can be isolating and challenging at times. Having a strong support network to lean on, vent to, and allow you to catch your breath is important. Search online for a support group or community that can relate to what you’re going through. Ask your EFMP Family Support provider to connect you with other military families or others with a common need or concern.

Take Care of Yourself

When someone you love has special needs, it’s easy to let your own needs slip into the background. But if your tank is empty, it’s hard to give your all to those you love. Take care of yourself. Fuel yourself with nutritious foods, find time to move, and get enough rest.

Respite care provides you with a temporary break by putting your family member in someone else’s care. While this may seem difficult to consider, taking time away from your caregiving duties to attend an appointment or take some time for yourself can help you manage your health and wellness and be a stronger caregiver in the long run.

When you need a break, consider your respite care options. EFMP offers respite care if you meet eligibility requirements. In addition, TRICARE’s Extended Care Health Option offers up to 16 hours of in-home respite care to eligible families.

Reach Out to a School Liaison

If you have a school-aged child, reach out to a school liaison. School liaisons are experienced professionals located at each installation who can support, advise, and help you navigate common education challenges to ensure your child’s educational needs are met. For example, a school liaison can help you locate a school, advise you on enrollment requirements and processes, and connect you to special education resources.

Learn More About Additional Resources

You are your family member’s best advocate. It’s important to know as much as you can about the laws, services, and resources available to support you. Here are some additional resources you may find helpful:

ChildCare.gov provides a lot of information about specific diagnoses, early intervention services, special education services, social security benefits, and more.

Military OneSource special needs consultants are available to help you navigate services and connect you with both military and community-based support.

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention provides a Milestone Tracker app that helps you track your child’s development, learn the signs, and act early if you have a concern.

‘Where’s the penalty to them?’ | Military, Veteran mental health providers face financial breaking point after months without payment from TriWest

By Julieanna Jackson

May 7, 2025

“Since January 1, when TriWest Healthcare Alliance took over as TRICARE’s contractor for Texas and five other states, providers report going unpaid for services, some for as long as four months.”

“The payment issues appear to stem from technical failures in TriWest’s new system. Providers across the region have reported similar problems — spending hours on hold with customer service, receiving inconsistent answers, and having no clear timeline for resolution.”

“The reason that we exist and work in conjunction with TRICARE and the VA is because the VA cannot support the sheer numbers,” Serfass said. “We were at war in Iraq for 9 years, in Afghanistan for 19 years. The VA can’t handle them all if they don’t have support from the civilian mental health side.”

A longer video is part of the article above. Shorter video here:

Questions for elected officials:

Any report of TRICARE up and running smoothly in 2025?

Does the new TRICARE contract include penalties for not running smoothly on Jan 1st?

Do they all get paid the same whether customers are happy or not?

Pick a decade anytime after the war in Vietnam. No matter what political party or personality is in the White House, Uncle Sam struggles to get veterans health care to work properly. Moms, Dads, Grandparents, and young people have access to this info.

Transcript

The Public News Service Friday afternoon update, I'm Mike Clifford.

President Donald Trump has signaled a willingness to drastically cut the U.S. current 145 percent tariff rate on China ahead of trade talks between the two countries.

That from NBC News.

The report Trump wrote in a social media post Friday morning, ""80 percent tariff on China seems right up to Scott B.""

And from the BBC, the new Pope, Leo XIV, has called for the Catholic Church to desperately counter a lack of faith in his first mass at the Vatican.

The Pope warned people were turning away from faith and instead to technology, money, success, power or pleasure.

Meantime, Republican lawmakers are considering billions of dollars to cuts to Medicaid.

A new report finds those spending cuts might impact health coverage for Virginia military families.

The report by the Georgetown Center for Children and Families finds more than 850,000 people enrolled in Medicaid have military health insurance, known as TRICARE, as their primary coverage.

One in 10 children of service members with TRICARE is also enrolled in Medicaid.

Retired Army Brigadier General George Schwartz says the youngest, lowest ranking and modestly paid service members would be most affected if Congress passes Medicaid cuts.

They're the most vulnerable and I think these cuts to Medicaid could affect not only their morale but their desire to stay in the military because they use Medicaid for supplementing particularly if they have children with special needs.

I'm Zimone Perez.

Next to Mississippi where new research shows folks may be experiencing the same climate change perception gap found across the globe when people underestimate how much their neighbors share their concerns.

The study published in Nature Climate Change found this pattern holds true in all 125 countries examined including the United States.

Anthony Leisowitz with the Yale Program on Climate Change Communication calls it a consistent human tendency.

The average person believes that other people in their own country tend not to worry about climate change that much when in fact the majority of people in most countries do worry about climate change.

He says the gap in perception has real world policy implications.

In the U.S. almost 80 percent of congressional staffers underestimated their constituents support for reducing climate pollution, sometimes by more than 50 percentage points.

I'm Tramiel Gomes.

According to NOAA data, the state has experienced a 42 percent increase in extreme rainfall since 2000.

And May is National Foster Care Month.

Carrie Eckert with Bethany Christian Services says their goal is to support families and kids through quality social services.

She shares a quote from the mother of Ellie, a girl from a tough background.

She has made honor roll every quarter, tried out for and made a sports team at her school, enjoys her youth group, volunteers with a club of her peers and in our church.

She handles her homework, manages her emotions, completes her chores, fills up her social calendar.

I'm just along for the ride, cheering her on.

In Pennsylvania, more than 15,000 children are waiting for foster families.

This is Public News Service.

A Michigan group is speaking out after a top congressional leader's comment that lawmakers will likely scrap the $7,500 federal tax credit for buying electric vehicles.

Ending the tax credit could deal a major blow to the EV market and the country's clean energy goals.

Michigan automakers and suppliers have pumped more than $30 billion into the state's EV industry since 2020.

Jay McCurry of Clean Fuels Michigan says her group joined several local and national nonprofits in signing a letter to the U.S.

House Transportation Committee in support of the EV tax credits.

Demonstrating that it's not just industry, not just individuals, but large nonprofits and advocacy groups that really care about continuing to show support for the clean mobility transition.

Despite growing Republican support for EV tax credits, some GOP senators have introduced the Elite Vehicles Act.

It would eliminate the $7,500 credit, a $4,000 credit for buying used EVs, and charging station incentives.

Crystal Blair reporting.

And despite uncertainty about Medicaid funding in Congress, Tennessee is moving ahead to help improve people's health outcomes with a program for community health workers.

The details from our Daniel Smith.

Tennessee's Medicaid program, TennCare, is partnering with the Tennessee Community Health Workers Association to offer an accreditation program that promotes best practices for training and supporting this workforce.

Nikala Boyd with the association says community health workers, or CHWs, link people to care and promote healthy habits.

So in addition to CHWs having individual certification, we are also accrediting the actual CHW program.

So accrediting that program, that organization, that employer.

TennCare will fund grants for up to 14 organizations to complete the accreditation process.

Finally, a new mapping tool shows South Dakota is a big player on the farm conservation scene.

The online feature coincides with polling that reveals most farmers want stronger funding for climate smart practices.

In a recent survey of more than 500 farms across the country, the National Wildlife Federation says three out of four support an increase in long-term funding for the USDA's voluntary conservation programs.

These initiatives incentivize farmers and ranchers to work their land in specific ways that make it more resilient to extreme weather, like prolonged droughts or widespread flooding.

The Federation's Aviva Glazer says survey support was consistent across geographic areas.

Farmers not only supported this funding, but they got a lot of value out of this funding and they cited things like soil health.

Meanwhile, NWSMAP shows South Dakota farmers have enrolled more than 7 million acres in the conservation stewardship program above all other states.

Winn director and Stewart-Hunter U.S. Army Medical Department commander Col. Margaret Berryman lauded Ochoa's critical role in ensuring that continuity of care, which, in turn, directly contributes to military readiness.
“Jim's leadership in EMS is paramount to our being a medically ready force and ensuring ready medical forces,"" Berryman said.
And now, as chief, I get to take care of my team, too.” Fittingly, the theme for Emergency Medical Services Week this year is “We Care.
For Everyone.” Be sure to thank your community’s paramedics and emergency medical technicians May 18-24 for their lifesaving care.","For the over 200,000 acres encompassing Fort Stewart-Hunter Army Airfield, Jim Ochoa is the calm in the storm, the steady hand guiding the critical first moments of a medical crisis. As chief of emergency medical services, Ochoa doesn't just manage a team; he orchestrates a lifeline, ensuring that when the unthinkable happens, a well-equipped and highly trained ambulance crew is ready to make every second count. His first responder colleagues also praise him for his role as a mentor, friend, leader, and community servant.

In his role as the EMS chief, Ochoa is responsible for the overall operation of the medical response assets on the military installation, ensuring the fleet of three ambulances are staffed with at least one paramedic each around the clock and ready to respond all day, every day, to any number of situations.

“We’re trained to provide care to a full range of patients—from infants to the elderly,” he said. “We handle emergencies in pediatrics, obstetrics, trauma, cardiac, and more. My responsibility is to make sure that when someone calls 911, a capable, well-equipped, and prepared ambulance crew responds promptly.

“In an emergency, seconds matter.”

Sometimes those emergencies include talking someone off of the edge, an event both medical services and police departments encounter almost daily. Law enforcement operations officer Maj. Richard Barrick, said the assistance Ochoa and team provide to police in instances like those is invaluable.

“If it were not for his dedication and training of his personnel we would not have such a success rate in getting people to the hospital to receive the proper care they require,” said the Department of the Army civilian police officer.

The hospital Ochoa and his team most often bring people needing care to is Fort Stewart’s military treatment facility, Winn Army Community Hospital. The hospital is working toward its re-designation as a level four trauma center and provides critical care for its beneficiaries, both inpatient and, when needed, sending patients to higher levels of care.

Winn director and Stewart-Hunter U.S. Army Medical Department commander Col. Margaret Berryman lauded Ochoa's critical role in ensuring that continuity of care, which, in turn, directly contributes to military readiness.

“Jim's leadership in EMS is paramount to our being a medically ready force and ensuring ready medical forces,"" Berryman said. ""His team's dedication ensures our Soldiers can focus on their mission, whether deployed or in the training area, knowing their families are in safe hands. Jim is a key part of the 'Winn'ing Team and keeps all of us ready and resilient.”

Being ready and resilient is second nature to Ochoa, an Army brat who joined the Army in 1988 as a combat medic and transitioned to being a paramedic on Fort Stewart in 1997. He has worked his way up through the ranks, from paramedic to supervisor, earning his wings as a flight paramedic and certification as a paramedic instructor, ultimately achieving his current role in 2016.

“As an Army medic, I was a senior line medic and knew every soldier in my platoon,” Ochoa said. “They weren’t just patients—they were friends, and I was committed to keeping them safe. That personal connection shaped how I approached the job.”

Working as a civilian paramedic changed the dynamic of that connection, Ochoa said.

“The people I care for are looking for someone who hears them and meets their needs,” he said.

Having all those levels of connection with the Army, from childhood, to military service, to civilian service, helped shape Ochoa’s perspective on how to relate with people.

“All of that built the foundation for my leadership today,” Ochoa said. “While I was hesitant to take the chief position at first—because I love patient care—I realized I could do more to help shape and evolve EMS on Fort Stewart.”

Shaping and evolving EMS here includes practicing for the worst day Stewart-Hunter could have. Together, EMS, police, and fire along with community partners rehearse responding to incidents. Fort Stewart assistant police chief Dorothea Mobley praised Ochoa for his team’s seamless integration by developing a shared understanding among first responders through his leadership, be it during an exercise or real-world incident.

“The success of coordinated operations like this illustrates that when law enforcement and EMS work in tandem—under visionary direction—the overall safety and well-being of the community are significantly enhanced” Mobley said. “Fort Stewart EMS is always mission-ready for large-scale emergencies and military-related exercises through a multifaceted approach that combines realistic scenario-based training, rigorous after-action reviews, and close interagency coordination.”

Setting the foundation for success in exercise and real-world incidents is another area Ochoa excel at said Fort Stewart police chief Bryan Lynch. Ochoa is the first to go through any task, exercise or real world, leading from the front. He is also a teacher, Lynch said, especially when it comes to teaching law enforcement to use its issued medical equipment.

“He is the first to sit down with all of our personnel to explain how and when to use it,” Lynch said.

While Ochoa may offer himself up first for training and incidents, it is his staff that comes first for him.

“They’re the ones doing the work, and my job is to make sure they have the tools, training, and resources they need to do it right” he said. That includes ensuring they’re equipped to respond to the wide variety of calls we receive—especially considering our responsibility covers 444 square miles of training area in addition to the cantonment zone.”

Being responsible for such a large area, including the more than 200,000 acres of training area making up Fort Stewart, presents several challenges, Ochoa said, including rough terrain and long distances. The major challenge, however, is time away from home, he said.

“Our crews work 24-hour shifts, similar to firefighters,” he said. “That can be tough, but we do build in enough time off to support life balance.”

Another challenge is the need to keep medical skills honed, ensuring paramedics are ready to any emergency, Ochoa said. The reward of keeping sharp is the outcomes.

“When our teams deliver the right care at the right time and it leads to a positive result, that’s what it’s all about,” Ochoa said. “I can say with extreme confidence that when my crews show up, they’re making the best decisions for those patients and getting them where they need to go safely.”

Getting patients to where they need to be is ultimately what matters, Ochoa said, not the recognition.

“I’d rather be behind the scenes,” he said. “When someone picks up the phone, I want them to know that someone will be there to take care of it. I don’t do this for the gratitude, although it often comes with the job. I do it because I love taking care of people. And now, as chief, I get to take care of my team, too.”

The company's first-quarter 2025 results revealed a sharp downturn, largely attributed to a temporary payment suspension by one of its major payers, TriCare.

Adding to the company’s troubles, this very TriCare payment issue has now become central to a recently announced class action lawsuit filed on behalf of Zynex investors. The lawsuit, Tuncel v.

Disappointing Q1 2025 Results Due to TriCare Suspension

On April 29, 2025, Zynex reported that its net revenue for the first quarter of 2025 plummeted to $26.6 million, a significant drop from the $46.5 million reported in the same period of 2024. The company also experienced a contraction in gross profit margin, falling to 69% in Q1 2025, compared to 80% in the prior year. The bottom line reflected these challenges, with an adjusted EBITDA loss of $11.8 million, a stark contrast to the $1.7 million in adjusted EBITDA recorded in the first quarter of 2024.

On the earnings call, Zynex CEO Thomas Sandgaard directly cited the TriCare payment suspension as a primary driver of the disappointing first-quarter results. He stated that the disruption significantly impacted revenue calculations and prompted the company to initiate a restructuring to prepare for a scenario where TriCare payments remain halted.

Looking ahead, Zynex has offered a muted revenue guidance of $27 million for the second quarter of 2025, with an anticipated EPS loss of $0.20. The company has withheld full-year guidance pending clarity on the TriCare situation, a decision that reflects the significant uncertainty surrounding this key payer relationship.

Analysts on the earnings call voiced concerns that the TriCare situation could create a domino effect, prompting other insurers to re-evaluate their reimbursement policies for Zynex's device.

Zynex Securities Class Action Alleges ""Oversupplying"" Scheme

The payment woes with Tricare appear to be intertwined with more serious allegations leveled against Zynex in a newly filed securities class action.

The core of the lawsuit’s allegations mirrors the explanation provided by Zynex for its poor financial performance. Investors claim that the company misled them by failing to disclose practices that ultimately led to the TriCare payment suspension. Specifically, the lawsuit contends that Zynex shipped excessive amounts of products, including electrodes, inflating revenue and drawing scrutiny from insurers like TriCare. The plaintiffs argue that the company should have warned investors about the likely adverse consequences of these practices, including the potential for payment suspensions and removal from insurer networks.

The complaint highlights a more than 5% drop in Zynex's share price following a June 4, 2024 report by STAT detailing an alleged ""oversupplying scheme."" This report, according to the lawsuit, raised concerns about the company's billing practices and likely contributed to the increased scrutiny from payers like TriCare.

The lawsuit further points to a dramatic over 51% plunge in Zynex's share price on March 11, 2025, the day the company reported its disappointing fourth-quarter 2024 results and disclosed the significant TriCare payment suspension.

Hagens Berman’s Investigation

Shareholder rights firm Hagens Berman is investigating the alleged claims. “The significant revenue decline and the revised guidance following the TriCare payment suspension raise serious questions about the accuracy and timeliness of Zynex's prior statements to investors. We are investigating whether the company adequately disclosed the risks associated with its billing practices and its reliance on TriCare revenues,” said Reed Kathrein, the Hagens Berman Partner leading the firm’s probe.

This broad-based development approach will give military medical providers more options for treatment – and provide refined control over blood product use and inventory management.
In this case, it means CPP is one step closer to potential approval for use in future combat trauma treatment.
In addition, having a wide selection of hemorrhage control products will help to fill the blood capability gap at distinct roles of care – providing more opportunities for lifesaving intervention.
“There is no one-size-fits-all approach to hemorrhage control or blood replacement therapies, especially in the critical moments after a catastrophic wound or injury,” said Mountney.","Blood loss due to battlefield wounds and injuries is a serious concern for U.S. Warfighters preparing for potential conflicts across the globe. The seconds, minutes, and hours after a casualty is wounded are critical to preventing combat trauma-related death.

U.S. casualty survival rates increased dramatically between WWII and Operations Enduring Freedom and Iraqi Freedom, in large part due to improved protection and treatment, better equipment and training, more robust medical logistics capabilities, and quicker medevac times. However, hemorrhage control and treatment – and the ability of medical providers at and near the front lines to arrange for casualty transportation to higher echelons of care – remain vitally important.

To answer these challenges, the Defense Health Agency is focused on preparing the U.S. Joint Force for the operations of today and the battlefields of tomorrow. DHA’s Operational Medical Systems team, based at Fort Detrick, Maryland, works with expert stakeholders across the Department of Defense, academia, and industry to develop solutions for America’s Warfighters, including hemorrhage control and blood replacement therapy programs to equip frontline providers with the lifesaving and life-prolonging treatments they require.

Managing severe bleeding in theater

“The OPMED blood program seeks to prevent deaths due to hemorrhage, the leading cause of preventable death on the battlefield,” said U.S. Army Lt. Col. Stephen Crimmins, a product manager with OPMED’s Warfighter Protection and Acute Care Project Management Office. “Cryopreserved platelets are one part of a larger blood program that also includes cold stored platelets and freeze-dried plasma.”

All three components of the program are critical in supporting hemorrhage control from the point of injury through the Role 3 level of trauma care, according to Crimmins. This broad-based development approach will give military medical providers more options for treatment – and provide refined control over blood product use and inventory management.

Platelet transfusions are essential in managing severe bleeding, but product shelf life and limited availability can pose logistical challenges in a far-forward environment. Cryopreserved platelets, or CPP, can be stored frozen for up to 5 years – providing a long-lasting alternative that can be deployed in both military and civilian healthcare settings.

Recently, OPMED’s commercial partner, Cellphire Therapeutics, Inc., received U.S. Food and Drug Administration “Fast Track” designation for its CPP treatment protocol, which is being developed for use when conventional platelets are not available or are in short supply. The designation, granted under the federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, is designed to expedite the development and review of drugs that address serious conditions and have the potential to fill an unmet medical need.

In this case, it means CPP is one step closer to potential approval for use in future combat trauma treatment.

“The Fast Track designation provides several benefits, including more frequent communication with the FDA, rolling review of completed sections of a submission, and eligibility for accelerated approval and priority review,” said Crimmins. “We feel that these benefits will help to quickly resolve problems as they come up and allow for an expedited review of the CPP submission – which could result in a faster delivery time of CPP to Warfighters.”

Expanding treatment options

A common issue with combat trauma hemorrhaging is coagulopathy, or the inability of blood to form clots, sometimes caused by platelet deficiency due to blood loss. During combat trauma treatment, medical providers can transfuse platelets to help stabilize patients – but traditional platelet treatments may be in short supply or impractical to administer at and near the front lines. Having an alternative, like the cryopreserved platelets that are currently in development, may give future providers another treatment option to decrease the likelihood of mortality in wounded service members.

In addition, having a wide selection of hemorrhage control products will help to fill the blood capability gap at distinct roles of care – providing more opportunities for lifesaving intervention. This combined approach with conventional platelets, cryopreserved platelets, and other blood replacement therapies will aid in improving survivability and reducing the impact of logistical lines crossing hundreds or thousands of miles, according to U.S. Army Lt. Col. Andrea Mountney, WPAC’s deputy program manager.

“There is no one-size-fits-all approach to hemorrhage control or blood replacement therapies, especially in the critical moments after a catastrophic wound or injury,” said Mountney. “In resource-limited environments and potential conflict areas with contested and congested logistics, it is imperative to have a multi-tiered approach for blood replacement therapies.”

Because of the large geographic distances in places like the Indo-Pacific – which comprises roughly 52% of the Earth’s surface – medevac capabilities for frontline providers may be more limited than during previous conflicts. The evolving nature of U.S. defense strategy places a premium on light logistical footprints, small-unit independence, and mission-specific force structures to maximize lethality while increasing maneuverability in littoral regions.

Developing lifesaving and life-prolonging blood products will go a long way toward meeting the mission needs of combatant commanders preparing for future large-scale combat operations in austere environments across the globe, according to Mountney.

“The cryopreserved platelets we are developing help to directly equip frontline medics, corpsmen, and health care providers with another tool to prolong life while awaiting medevac and mitigate the effects of severe bleeding when traditional options are exhausted,” she said. “Blood and blood products continue to be one of the most valuable resources in combat medicine – it is critical to have as many treatment options as possible.”

Lazanda, a fentanyl nasal spray, is approved by the FDA solely for break-through cancer pain in patients who are already receiving and who are tolerant to opioid therapy for their underlying persistent cancer pain. The United States alleges that, between 2013 and 2017, Assertio, which was known as Depomed at the time, caused the submission of false claims to the Medicare and TRICARE programs by focusing its marketing on pain specialists who were prescribing high volumes of TIRF products, including those who were flagged for diversion or who were later indicted. The United States further alleges that Assertio placed high-volume TIRF prescribers on its speakers’ bureau and advisory boards and developed its “Signature Support Program” to ensure that Lazanda prescriptions would be approved by insurance companies, including Medicare Part D plans. The United States contends that Assertio’s marketing efforts caused prescribers to write Lazanda prescriptions for Medicare and TRICARE beneficiaries who did not have breakthrough cancer pain, resulting in the submission of false claims to Medicare and TRICARE from thirteen high-volume prescribers.

“This company took steps to boost its profits despite the risk of boosting the deadly opioid epidemic, said U.S. Attorney Edward R. Martin Jr. for the District of Columbia. “Our office will continue to seek out violations like this that demonstrate a brazen disregard for the safety of the public.”

“At a time when communities across the country are still dealing with the devasting impact of the opioid epidemic, pharmaceutical companies have a responsibility to uphold the highest standards of integrity,” said Acting Assistant Director Darren Cox of the FBI’s Criminal Investigative Division. “This settlement reflects the FBI’s unwavering commitment to protecting public health and holding those accountable who fuel addiction and defraud federal healthcare programs through deceptive marketing of powerful drugs like fentanyl.”

“Violations of the False Claims Act such as the illegal prescribing practices alleged in this settlement are especially egregious considering the opioid epidemic,” said Deputy Inspector General Christian J. Schrank of the Department of Health and Human Services Office of Inspector General (HHS-OIG). “HHS-OIG will continue to work with our law enforcement partners to ensure health care providers and corporations involved in schemes that threaten patient safety are held accountable.”

The civil settlement includes the resolution of claims under the qui tam, or whistleblower, provisions of the FCA by Noelle Webb and Nicole Novellino, who previously worked at Assertio as sales representatives. The FCA authorizes private parties to sue on behalf of the United States for false claims and share in any recovery. The qui tam case is captioned United States ex rel. Webb et al. v.

(NASDAQ: ZYXI) is facing a double whammy linked to its dealings with TriCare, the healthcare program for the U.S. military community. The company's first-quarter 2025 results revealed a sharp downturn, largely attributed to a temporary payment suspension by one of its major payers, TriCare.

Adding to the company’s troubles, this very TriCare payment issue has now become central to a recently announced class action lawsuit filed on behalf of Zynex investors. The lawsuit, Tuncel v. Zynex, Inc., No. 25-cv-00913 (D. Colo.), alleges that Zynex and certain top executives violated federal securities laws between March 13, 2023, and March 11, 2025.

Disappointing Q1 2025 Results Due to TriCare Suspension

On April 29, 2025, Zynex reported that its net revenue for the first quarter of 2025 plummeted to $26.6 million, a significant drop from the $46.5 million reported in the same period of 2024. The company also experienced a contraction in gross profit margin, falling to 69% in Q1 2025, compared to 80% in the prior year. The bottom line reflected these challenges, with an adjusted EBITDA loss of $11.8 million, a stark contrast to the $1.7 million in adjusted EBITDA recorded in the first quarter of 2024.

On the earnings call, Zynex CEO Thomas Sandgaard directly cited the TriCare payment suspension as a primary driver of the disappointing first-quarter results. He stated that the disruption significantly impacted revenue calculations and prompted the company to initiate a restructuring to prepare for a scenario where TriCare payments remain halted.

Looking ahead, Zynex has offered a muted revenue guidance of $27 million for the second quarter of 2025, with an anticipated EPS loss of $0.20. The company has withheld full-year guidance pending clarity on the TriCare situation, a decision that reflects the significant uncertainty surrounding this key payer relationship.

Analysts on the earnings call voiced concerns that the TriCare situation could create a domino effect, prompting other insurers to re-evaluate their reimbursement policies for Zynex's device.

Zynex Securities Class Action Alleges ""Oversupplying"" Scheme

The payment woes with Tricare appear to be intertwined with more serious allegations leveled against Zynex in a newly filed securities class action.

The core of the lawsuit’s allegations mirrors the explanation provided by Zynex for its poor financial performance. Investors claim that the company misled them by failing to disclose practices that ultimately led to the TriCare payment suspension. Specifically, the lawsuit contends that Zynex shipped excessive amounts of products, including electrodes, inflating revenue and drawing scrutiny from insurers like TriCare. The plaintiffs argue that the company should have warned investors about the likely adverse consequences of these practices, including the potential for payment suspensions and removal from insurer networks.

The complaint highlights a more than 5% drop in Zynex's share price following a June 4, 2024 report by STAT detailing an alleged ""oversupplying scheme."" This report, according to the lawsuit, raised concerns about the company's billing practices and likely contributed to the increased scrutiny from payers like TriCare.

The lawsuit further points to a dramatic over 51% plunge in Zynex's share price on March 11, 2025, the day the company reported its disappointing fourth-quarter 2024 results and disclosed the significant TriCare payment suspension.

Hagens Berman’s Investigation

Shareholder rights firm Hagens Berman is investigating the alleged claims. “The significant revenue decline and the revised guidance following the TriCare payment suspension raise serious questions about the accuracy and timeliness of Zynex's prior statements to investors. We are investigating whether the company adequately disclosed the risks associated with its billing practices and its reliance on TriCare revenues,” said Reed Kathrein, the Hagens Berman Partner leading the firm’s probe.

“The Defense Health Network Central is the largest network in the Military Health System,” said Harrell during senior leader mission overviews about DHN Central, WHASC, BAMC, and the 59th MDW, all located at Joint Base San Antonio.
“And here in San Antonio, you are doing more force generation than anywhere else.
After the visit, Harrell expressed his appreciation for Ferrara’s visit to Joint Base San Antonio.
""We were honored to host Dr. Ferrara and showcase the unique capabilities of the San Antonio Military Health System, along with our steadfast commitment to delivering world-class health care to our nation’s warfighters and their families,” said Harrell.","The Military Health System’s top leader got a firsthand look at the unrivaled medical capabilities offered by the San Antonio military healthcare system during a special visit to Joint Base San Antonio, Texas, on April 18.

Dr. Stephen Ferrara, appointed in January 2025 as the acting assistant secretary of defense for health affairs, visited San Antonio military hospitals and training campuses to gain further insights into the complex structure of the area’s medical system and staff.

“These visits are so valuable to learn about what you do and to meet the people doing the work. It gives me a keener understanding of how things are going,” Ferrara said during opening remarks with medical leadership.

Hosted by U.S. Air Force Maj. Gen. Thomas Harrell, director of the Defense Health Agency’s Defense Health Network Central, the fast-paced visit included walking tours of Wilford Hall Ambulatory Surgical Center’s emergency department, and Brooke Army Medical Center’s emergency department, which is part of the only Level 1 trauma center in the Department of Defense. During the visit, staff explained how the partnership between the 59th Medical Wing and BAMC enables the support of 2.5 million patient visits each year.

Ferrara also toured the Medical Education and Training Campus surgical technologist and hospital corpsman basic courses, the U.S. Army Medical Center of Excellence, U.S. Army Institute of Surgical Research Burn Center, and the Center for the Intrepid.

While at METC, Ferrara visited the nursing synthesis lab, Tactical Combat Casualty Care and Shipboard Mass Casualty labs, which are curricula in the Navy Hospital Corpsman Basic course. He also observed a mock surgery and participated in a laparoscopy procedure—a method for doing surgery using a thin, lighted tube with a camera—part of METC’s Surgical Technologist course.

“It’s been a great day seeing where our young enlisted come in and learn these critical medical skills,” Ferrara said, referring to his visit to METC. “This is readiness right here.”

Throughout the visit, Ferrara talked with staff and asked questions about their operations, resources, and challenges they encounter in supporting the high volume and complexity of patient care across the San Antonio military healthcare system.

“The Defense Health Network Central is the largest network in the Military Health System,” said Harrell during senior leader mission overviews about DHN Central, WHASC, BAMC, and the 59th MDW, all located at Joint Base San Antonio. “Everything goes back to sustaining and creating lethality of the force. It’s all about generating medics to support the mission.”

In addition to the walking tours, Ferrara had an opportunity to discuss his priorities for the MHS and speak with medical staff during two town halls at Wilford Hall and BAMC.

“I love to get out to do these visits to see where the work is done because that’s what informs the decision making, in my opinion. First and foremost, I want to thank you for the work you do taking care of patients, being your very best and training the next generation,” Ferrara said during the town hall at WHASC.

In his role as the acting ASD-HA, Ferrara said he can actively advocate for the needs of the MHS.

“I’m the liaison between the MHS, the secretary, and the White House. I’m your voice and that’s key. When I come here and see that texture and learn those anecdotes, I can talk about real-world things. I learned a lot here this morning at Wilford Hall about the amazing work and volume of patients you see in the emergency room, the large volume of calls your EMS team does, the [number] of people you are training—and you are also training the next generation. One of my immediate priorities is to ensure you have the things you need.”

In his advocacy role, Ferrara said his priorities for the MHS are to support the warfighter, sustain our skills, and strengthen our chain, which he explained is the continuity of trained healthcare professionals that can’t be broken because they take the baton as part of our force-generation platform.

“One of my jobs, which I feel has been effective so far in these first 90 to 100 days, is showing how we affect lethality by keeping guns in the fight. When people think of a weapons system they might think of a hypersonic weapon or a fighter aircraft–but for us, the human is the weapons system—the airman, soldier, sailor, Marine, or Guardian. By us keeping them healthy and by generating a medically ready force, we are empowering the warfighter to go and do what they need to do.”

After taking in the facility tours and talking with medical staff, Ferrara summed up his perspective about the unique and integrated readiness capabilities within the San Antonio military healthcare system.

“San Antonio is really the center of gravity in the MHS for sustaining our skills,” Ferrara concluded during the town hall at BAMC. “It’s the place where you have the highest patient count—seeing more emergency room visits than most. And BAMC has the only Level 1 trauma center in the MHS—that’s how you sustain your skills, doing those high-volume, high-complexity cases.

“And here in San Antonio, you are doing more force generation than anywhere else. You are paying forward to make sure you train someone well to come in, and that’s hugely important. Those are the priorities,” he said.

After the visit, Harrell expressed his appreciation for Ferrara’s visit to Joint Base San Antonio.

""We were honored to host Dr. Ferrara and showcase the unique capabilities of the San Antonio Military Health System, along with our steadfast commitment to delivering world-class health care to our nation’s warfighters and their families,” said Harrell. “As the largest force-generating platform—home to the DOD’s sole Level 1 trauma center and burn center—this system plays a vital role in sustaining the health, wellness, and operational readiness of our force.”",https://d1ldvf68ux039x.cloudfront.net/thumbs/photos/2504/8987229/1000w_q95.jpg,N,1.0,2025-05-09 11:56:28.867483

To receive an emergency refill of prescription medications, TRICARE beneficiaries should take their prescription bottle to any TRICARE retail network pharmacy. If the bottle is unavailable or the label is damaged or missing, beneficiaries should contact Express Scripts, Inc., or their retail network pharmacy for assistance.

To find a network pharmacy, beneficiaries may call Express Scripts at 1-877-363-1303, or search the network pharmacy locator.

If possible, visit the pharmacy where the prescription was filled. Prescriptions filled by a retail chain may be filled at another store in that chain. If the clinician who prescribed the medication is available, beneficiaries can ask them to call in a new prescription to any network pharmacy.

As a reminder, TRICARE beneficiaries, other than active duty service members, may receive urgent care from any TRICARE-authorized urgent care center or provider and do not need a referral. This allows beneficiaries to seek nonemergency care for illnesses or injuries if their primary care provider is unavailable because of emergencies. Any TRICARE beneficiary who reasonably believes they have an emergency should always call 911 or, go to the nearest emergency room.

Beneficiaries are advised to visit Express Scripts’ Weather Notices page for updates.

If you’re thinking about joining the military, it’s natural to have questions—especially if you’ve experienced mental health challenges in the past. One of the most common concerns among potential recruits is: does the military check your mental health records? The answer is nuanced, and it depends on several factors including the branch you’re applying to, the severity of your history, and how recent the diagnosis or treatment was.

The military takes both mental and physical fitness seriously, not to exclude people unnecessarily, but to ensure that every service member can handle the intense pressures of duty. Understanding how the process works can help reduce anxiety and ensure you’re prepared for what comes next.

That’s where our guide from the expert team at TriCareRehabs will become an essential asset, so keep reading to learn all you need to know about mental health records and the military.

Does the Military Look at Mental Health Records During Recruitment?

Yes, the military does review your medical records and mental health history as part of the enlistment process. This review helps determine if you’re fit for service under Department of Defense medical standards.

When you apply to enlist, you’ll complete a detailed medical history questionnaire. This medical screening will include questions about past mental health diagnoses, counseling, medications, hospitalizations, or any other behavioral health-related concerns.

Being honest about your medical information on this form is crucial. If you’ve had a diagnosis of depression, anxiety, PTSD, ADHD, or other conditions, you’ll likely be asked for documentation or further evaluation.

The military doesn’t automatically disqualify from the recruitment process if they have a mental health history. However, they do evaluate the circumstances carefully to ensure your safety and the safety of those you serve.

How Does the Military Access Your Records?

The military does not have automatic access to your private medical or psychiatric records without your consent. However, when you sign your enlistment paperwork, you authorize the Department of Defense and Military Entrance Processing Station (MEPS) to request records if something in your history flags the need for additional review.

This means they may reach out to doctors, therapists, or hospitals you’ve seen if it relates to a declared condition or red flag in your application. If you try to withhold information and it’s later discovered, it can lead to disqualification, delayed enlistment, or even discharge after entry. Full transparency is not only ethical but often in your best interest, especially if your condition is treatable or considered resolved.

What Mental Health Conditions Can Affect Military Eligibility?

Some mental health issues are considered disqualifying for military service, particularly if they are recent, untreated, or interfere with functioning. These may include:

Schizophrenia or other psychotic disorders

Bipolar disorder

Severe depression with suicidal ideation or attempts

Anxiety or panic disorders that impair functioning

Substance use disorders within the past year

PTSD or trauma-related disorders, particularly if recently diagnosed

However, conditions like mild depression or anxiety, especially if resolved without long-term medication, may not be disqualifying. If you’ve been off medication for a significant period, completed therapy successfully, or your symptoms have not recurred, you may still be eligible.

In many cases, a waiver can be requested, and the final decision is made by military medical professionals who consider the totality of your health, recovery, and current functioning.

Can You Still Join the Military If You’ve Seen a Therapist?

Yes, seeing a therapist does not automatically bar you from military service. In fact, seeking help when needed shows maturity and responsibility. What matters more is the reason for the therapy, the diagnosis (if any), the outcome, and whether any symptoms remain. Routine counseling for stress, grief, family issues, or non-clinical concerns is generally not disqualifying.

If you’ve seen a therapist but were never diagnosed with a serious mental illness, and your care was short-term or preventative, it likely won’t impact your application. Again, honesty is key. If you’re unsure how your mental or physical health history might be interpreted, talking with a recruiter or a medical liaison at MEPS can help you prepare.

How to Handle Mental Health Disclosures During Military Enlistment

Navigating the mental health portion of the enlistment process can feel stressful, but the right approach makes a big difference. First, gather accurate information about your history. This includes diagnoses, treatment timelines, medications, and discharge notes if you were ever hospitalized. Second, talk to your providers.

Ask if they can write a summary of your treatment and outcomes, especially if your care is complete and you are now stable. Third, be upfront with your recruiter. They’re used to seeing a wide range of histories and can often tell you if a waiver might be possible.

Trying to hide or minimize your past can raise red flags that delay or even block your application. Transparency shows integrity—something the military values highly.

What Is a Mental Health Waiver and How Do You Get One?

If a condition you disclose is technically disqualifying, your recruiter may recommend applying for a mental health waiver. A waiver for military health records is a formal request for the military to reconsider your eligibility based on additional evidence of stability, recovery, or low risk of recurrence.

To support a waiver, you may need letters from mental health providers, records showing completion of treatment, or even undergo an independent evaluation.

The process can take time, and not all medical waivers are granted, but many people with a documented history of improvement successfully join with a waiver. Each branch—Army, Navy, Air Force, Marines, and Coast Guard—has its own guidelines, but all follow Department of Defense medical standards as a baseline.

Will Your Mental Health Be Evaluated Again After Enlistment?

Yes, mental wellness is a key part of readiness, and mental health assessments don’t end after you join. The military offers support for service members throughout their careers, including access to behavioral health professionals, confidential counseling, and crisis intervention services through the Department of Veterans Affairs and other military organizations.

It’s also common to undergo mental health checks as part of deployment preparation or after experiencing trauma. If you’re already enlisted and begin to struggle with mental health, seeking support is not a sign of weakness—it’s a sign of strength. The culture around mental health in the military is changing, with growing efforts to reduce stigma and encourage treatment without punishment or judgment.

How to Prepare Mentally and Emotionally for Military Life

Military service is demanding—physically, mentally, and emotionally. Preparing yourself in all three areas increases your chance of success and satisfaction. Here are some steps you can take:

Build resilience through regular exercise, healthy sleep, and stress-reduction techniques like mindfulness or journaling

Address unresolved mental health concerns before enlistment to show you’re proactive about your well-being

Talk with others who’ve served to understand the emotional demands of training, deployment, and reintegration

Stay connected to supportive friends, family, or a therapist who can help you navigate challenges as they arise

The military values individuals who are self-aware, adaptable, and emotionally strong—not perfect. Demonstrating that you’ve done the work to get and stay healthy can be a powerful asset in your application and beyond.

What to Do If You’re Denied Entry Because of Mental Health

If you’re denied entry due to your mental health history, it’s not the end of the road. You may be able to:

Appeal the decision with new documentation or provider testimony.

Apply for a waiver if one wasn’t initially offered.

Wait a period of time, continue treatment, and reapply when you can show longer-term stability.

Consider other paths to serve your country such as the National Guard, ROTC programs, or civilian roles within the defense and security sectors.

Most importantly, continue taking care of your mental health. Rejection doesn’t define your worth or potential—it’s simply one step in a much larger journey. There are many ways to serve, and the most valuable thing you can offer the world is your health and wholeness.

Can You Join the Military With a History of Inpatient Mental Health Treatment?

Inpatient treatment does raise additional scrutiny, but it doesn’t always mean disqualification. The key questions the military will ask include:

How long ago was the hospitalization?

What condition was treated?

Were there any self-harm or suicide-related events?

Have you completed treatment and remained stable without relapse?

If it’s been several years since your inpatient stay and you’ve functioned well since then—holding a job, completing school, or maintaining strong relationships—there’s a possibility for waiver consideration. Documentation from your treatment team can be critical in showing how far you’ve come. Don’t let a difficult chapter in your past stop you from exploring your future.

Is It Worth Pursuing a Military Career If You Have a Mental Health History?

Only you can answer that, but the truth is that many people with prior mental health concerns go on to serve with distinction. The military isn’t looking for perfection—they’re looking for people who are capable, resilient, and mission-ready.

If you’ve worked hard on your mental wellness, if you understand your limits and your strengths, and if you want to serve for the right reasons, then yes—it can absolutely be worth it.

Use this journey as a chance to advocate for yourself, build discipline, and show how your past has shaped you into a strong and self-aware person. Those are the kinds of people who make an impact, whether in uniform or out.

What You Should Know Before Enlisting

Mental health history doesn’t define your future, but it does shape how you’ll be evaluated during the military enlistment process. Be honest, be prepared, and be proactive. If you’re currently receiving care, that’s not a weakness—it’s a sign that you take your well-being seriously. Work with your providers, gather your records, and talk openly with your recruiter.

Every branch of the military wants capable individuals who can thrive under pressure, and that includes those who’ve overcome adversity. If you’re committed to your growth and willing to walk through the process with integrity, your past doesn’t have to limit your future. Whether you wear the uniform or find another way to serve, your mental health journey is a strength—not a setback.
