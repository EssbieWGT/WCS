After the War Department and the VA, the Departments of Energy, Homeland Security and Health and Human Services have the most unresolved GAO recommendations, at 163, 160, and 149, respectively.
About 6% of the War Department’s unresolved recommendations are classified as priority, while 12% of the VA’s are.","(The Center Square) – Of the 15 federal executive departments that compose the president’s Cabinet, the Departments of War and Veterans Affairs have the most unresolved, open recommendations for improvement from congressional watchdog, the Government Accountability Office.

The Department of War, which is overwhelmingly the largest executive branch department with about 3 million military and civilian personnel, has the most by far, with 778 open recommendations stretching back to 2011. Forty-eight of those were marked as priority. The Department of Veterans Affairs is the second-largest executive department, with more than 450,000 employees, and it has the second-highest, with 180 unresolved recommendations going back to 2012 and 22 flagged as priority.

The Government Accountability Office was established by Congress in 1921 as an independent, non-partisan congressional watchdog agency founded to “investigate all matters related to the use of public funds.” It provides reports to congressional committees and subcommittees on various government departments, agencies and projects to inform legislation and oversight.

Those reports typically include a list of recommendations for how the report’s subject can be improved. The recommendations are divided into priority action items and non-priority action items based on what is most pressing or important.

The War Department has some unresolved open priority recommendations from the office dating back to 2013 on topics like the poor living conditions in military barracks, improper TRICARE payments, fraud risk management and sustainment of the F-35 fighter jet program. Of all of the department’s open priority recommendations, it has partially addressed 15.

Many of the VA’s open priority recommendations are related to the department’s attempts to replace its legacy health records system. It rolled out a new electronic health records system starting with five medical centers in 2023 and was “making incremental improvements” to the new system as of March 2025, according to GAO, but there was still a lot to be done. There are approximately 170 VA Medical Centers.

The VA’s oldest unresolved priority recommendation concerns its “incomplete” sexual harassment policies and dates back to a 2020 report. The department has resolved all priority recommendations through 2019, according to GAO records, meaning the 22 that are open only date back to 2020. Of those, the VA has partially addressed five.

Some departments have open recommendations dating back to the early 2000s.

After the War Department and the VA, the Departments of Energy, Homeland Security and Health and Human Services have the most unresolved GAO recommendations, at 163, 160, and 149, respectively. About 6% of the War Department’s unresolved recommendations are classified as priority, while 12% of the VA’s are.",https://bloximages.newyork1.vip.townnews.com/thecentersquare.com/content/tncms/assets/v3/editorial/2/89/2897ef98-d9f5-40b7-b37c-9391b4017374/68dc22f86b013.image.jpg,N,0.0,2025-11-23 04:56:42.346369

""There was a large list, the carrier was very easy to work with,"" said DeMarco, a mother of three and a behavioral health professional.
Arizona is not new to the managed care model, which means the state does not directly provide or administer most care.
In the Medicare Advantage plans, 55% of listed behavioral health providers were inactive; in Medicaid managed care plans, 28% were inactive.
HHS-OIG surveyed providers to understand why they stop participating in Medicaid managed care and Medicare Advantage networks.","PHOENIX -- Joseph DeMarco was about to turn 19 when he first showed the signs of a severe mental health condition.

By then, his family had already switched insurance plans from TRICARE, a health plan for military personnel, retirees and their families, to Mercy Care, a large nonprofit insurer that contracts with AHCCCS, Arizona's Medicaid program.

Joseph's mother, Seetha DeMarco, said they never struggled to find mental health providers under TRICARE.

""There was a large list, the carrier was very easy to work with,"" said DeMarco, a mother of three and a behavioral health professional. ""I didn't contact a provider that was no longer enrolled with TRICARE.""

Things changed after the switch, she said.

""Each and every time I've contacted Mercy Care to identify a provider in the network, they direct you to a website with a list,"" she said. ""It would take days to go through that list and find a provider that is active and enrolled with Mercy.""

She said they didn't find a competent provider until 2025, nearly 10 years later.

The impact extends beyond inconvenience: without timely care, people with serious mental illness often experience worsening symptoms, instability or repeated crises.

DeMarco's experience reflects what federal investigators have identified as ""ghost networks.""

A ""ghost network is really a directory of providers that's just largely unreachable, out of network or doesn't accept new patients,"" said Meridith Seife, deputy regional inspector general and a co-author of the recent report from the Office of Inspector General (OIG) at the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services.

Companies that operate private Medicare Advantage and Medicaid managed care plans have inflated and inaccurate lists of psychologists, psychiatrists, social workers and other mental health providers they say are available to subscribers, the report found.

That runs counter to federal rules requiring plans to keep their directories current. The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services mandates updates every quarter or within 30 days when a provider's status changes.

Arizona is not new to the managed care model, which means the state does not directly provide or administer most care. The state pioneered Medicaid managed care by creating AHCCCS, the first mandatory statewide program, funded mainly by the federal government, with the remaining quarter covered by the state.

The program's proposed budget for fiscal 2025 is approximately $22.3 billion. Private insurers that contract with AHCCCS to deliver most of the physical and behavioral health services to eligible Arizonans are paid monthly per-member capitation payments from those public funds.

""There was a significant percentage of providers that were inactive, meaning they had not provided a single service throughout an entire year,"" Seife said. ""Almost three-quarters of them should not have been listed in those network directories.""

HHS-OIG reviewed plans across 10 counties in five states, sampling one urban and one rural county in each, targeting ""geographically representative samples around the country."" Urban Maricopa and rural Santa Cruz counties in Arizona were included in the report. In the Medicare Advantage plans, 55% of listed behavioral health providers were inactive; in Medicaid managed care plans, 28% were inactive.

HHS-OIG surveyed providers to understand why they stop participating in Medicaid managed care and Medicare Advantage networks. Many described the administrative workload as overwhelming.

""Keeping up with them (administrative requirements) is nearly impossible and clinical staff feel like they are just cogs in a wheel versus clinicians,"" Seife said.

Other providers cited reimbursement rates that do not cover the cost of care, making continued participation financially unsustainable.

To address these issues, HHS-OIG recommends steps to reduce the administrative requirements and create a centralized, nationwide directory that would be a ""single place that providers could list all the insurance plans they participate in, their correct addresses,"" Seife said.

In a written statement to Cronkite News, AHCCCS acknowledged the challenges and outlined ongoing efforts, stating the agency recognizes ""that timely access to behavioral health services is critical to the well-being of our members, and we share the OIG's commitment to improving transparency and accountability in provider networks.""

The AHCCCS statement highlighted ongoing efforts to improve care access, including increased monitoring of network adequacy, reducing administrative hurdles for providers, investing in behavioral health workforce development and exploring improvements to public-facing provider search tools.

The state agency noted that rural and tribal communities remain the most impacted by provider shortages.

Cronkite News reached out to a number of private insurance companies operating in Arizona; however, none had responded by the time of publication.

Frequently Asked Questions Does Tricare cover all weight loss medications?","Key Takeaways

Zepbound is an FDA-approved medication for chronic weight management and obesity-related obstructive sleep apnea.

Tricare coverage for Zepbound depends on specific plan details and medical necessity criteria.

Patients often need prior authorization and must meet clinical guidelines to qualify for coverage.

Combining Zepbound with lifestyle changes enhances treatment effectiveness.

Doctronic.ai offers convenient telehealth services that can help patients navigate treatment options and prescriptions.

Zepbound, a breakthrough in pharmacotherapy, works by targeting specific pathways in the brain that regulate appetite and metabolism, making it a vital tool for those struggling with obesity. The medication not only aids in weight loss but also plays a crucial role in improving overall health outcomes, particularly for individuals suffering from obesity-related conditions such as type 2 diabetes and hypertension. Clinical trials have shown that patients using Zepbound alongside a structured diet and exercise program can achieve significant weight loss, which in turn can lead to reductions in the severity of sleep apnea symptoms, enhancing sleep quality and overall well-being.

Understanding the nuances of insurance coverage can be daunting for patients considering Zepbound. Each Tricare plan has its own set of criteria for medication approval, which often includes documentation of previous weight loss attempts and current health assessments. This process can be streamlined with the help of healthcare providers who are familiar with the necessary paperwork and guidelines. Telehealth services like those provided by Doctronic.ai are particularly beneficial in this context, as they allow patients to consult with healthcare professionals from the comfort of their homes, ensuring they receive timely advice and support as they navigate the complexities of treatment options and insurance requirements.

Understanding Zepbound and Its Medical Uses

What Is Zepbound?

Zepbound, known generically as tirzepatide, is a once-weekly injectable medication approved by the FDA to help adults manage chronic weight issues. It targets two hormone pathways, GIP and GLP-1, which regulate appetite, digestion, and insulin release. By reducing hunger and slowing stomach emptying, Zepbound supports significant weight loss over time. This dual-action approach not only enhances the body’s ability to manage glucose levels but also promotes a feeling of fullness, making it easier for individuals to adhere to dietary changes. Clinical trials have demonstrated that patients using Zepbound can achieve substantial weight loss compared to those on a placebo, highlighting its potential as a transformative option for weight management.

How Zepbound Helps with Obstructive Sleep Apnea

Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is often worsened by excess weight, which can cause fat deposits around the airway, leading to airway collapse during sleep. Zepbound does not act directly on sleep centers but helps improve OSA by reducing weight, thereby decreasing airway obstruction. Patients with obesity-related OSA may see meaningful improvements in their symptoms with sustained weight loss on Zepbound. As weight loss progresses, many patients report enhanced sleep quality, increased energy levels, and improved overall health, which can contribute to better daytime functioning. The relationship between weight management and sleep apnea underscores the importance of a comprehensive approach to treating OSA, where lifestyle changes and medical interventions work in tandem to achieve optimal results.

Important Considerations and Side Effects

While Zepbound offers promising benefits, it is not suitable for everyone. People with a personal or family history of medullary thyroid carcinoma or multiple endocrine neoplasia syndrome type 2 should avoid this medication. Common side effects include nausea, appetite changes, diarrhea, and abdominal discomfort. Consistent dosing and follow-up with healthcare providers are essential for safety and effectiveness. Patients should be aware that while some side effects may diminish over time, others may require medical attention. It is crucial for patients to maintain open communication with their healthcare team to monitor their progress and adjust treatment plans as necessary. Lifestyle modifications, such as incorporating regular physical activity and a balanced diet, can enhance the efficacy of Zepbound and contribute to long-term weight management success.

Does Tricare Cover Zepbound?

Tricare Overview

Tricare is the health insurance program serving military members, retirees, and their families. It offers various plans with different coverage rules depending on the beneficiary’s status and location. Understanding whether Tricare covers a specific medication like Zepbound requires looking at plan details and medical necessity requirements.

Coverage Criteria for Weight Management Medications

Tricare generally covers medications for chronic conditions if they are FDA-approved and medically necessary. For weight management drugs, coverage often hinges on documented obesity or related health issues, such as type 2 diabetes or obstructive sleep apnea. Patients must typically demonstrate previous attempts at lifestyle modification before coverage is approved.

Is Zepbound Included?

As a newer medication, Zepbound’s inclusion on Tricare’s formulary may vary. Some Tricare plans might cover it under specialty drugs or weight management categories, but prior authorization is almost always required. This process involves submitting medical records and evidence that the patient meets clinical guidelines for use.

Steps to Confirm Coverage

Check your specific Tricare plan formulary online or contact Tricare customer service.

Consult your healthcare provider to determine if Zepbound is appropriate for your condition.

Ask your provider to submit a prior authorization request if needed.

Consider alternative medications if Zepbound is not covered or if authorization is denied.

Maximizing the Benefits of Zepbound

Combining Medication with Lifestyle Changes

While Zepbound can significantly aid weight loss, it works best when paired with healthy eating, regular exercise, and behavioral changes. Patients should view the medication as one component of a comprehensive weight management plan rather than a standalone solution.

Monitoring and Follow-Up

Regular medical follow-up is crucial to track progress, manage side effects, and adjust treatment as needed. Telehealth services like Doctronic.ai make it easier to maintain consistent communication with healthcare providers, ensuring ongoing support throughout your weight loss journey.

Setting Realistic Expectations

Weight loss with Zepbound is gradual and requires patience. Most patients experience meaningful improvements in metabolic health and OSA severity over months of treatment. Staying committed to the prescribed regimen and lifestyle changes is key to long-term success.

Tricare and Zepbound

Tricare coverage for Zepbound is possible, but it depends on your specific plan and meeting medical necessity criteria. Prior authorization and documentation are usually required. Patients interested in this medication should work closely with their healthcare providers to explore options and ensure proper use.

Telehealth platforms like Doctronic.ai offer an accessible way to get expert medical advice, prescriptions, and ongoing care for weight management and related conditions. Leveraging these services can simplify navigating insurance coverage and treatment decisions.

Buyers in the U.S. who rushed to secure incentives in September left a gap that quickly showed up in October sales. New EV sales fell to an estimated 74,835 units, down 48.9 per cent from September and 30.3 per cent year over year. EV market share slid to 5.8 per cent from September’s 11.6 per cent.

Declines were widespread: luxury EVs fell 39 per cent and non-luxury dropped 65 per cent. Tesla led with 40,650 units sold, down 35.3 per cent month over month, but still gained share to reach 54.3 per cent as competitors posted deeper losses. Rivian recorded the smallest decline among major brands at 14.7 per cent.

Used EV sales reached 31,610 units, down 20.4 per cent from September but still 36.2 per cent higher than a year earlier. Market share slipped to 1.9 per cent. Tesla again led the segment with 11,927 units.

Inventory levels rose as demand cooled. New EV days’ supply climbed to 79, up sharply from September’s 48-day low. GMC posted the highest supply at 91 days, while Subaru remained lean at eight days. Used EV days’ supply increased to 39, though still below ICE levels.

Prices continued to rise. The average new EV transaction price reached $59,125, up 1.6 per cent month over month. Used EV listing prices surged 8.6 per cent to $37,538, widening the gap with ICE models.

The province’s year-to-date total now sits 0.5 per cent below the same period last year, marking a shift for a market that typically anchors national performance.

The decline comes as last year’s rush to capture outsized EV incentives continues to distort year-over-year comparisons. That late-2024 surge also contributed to the province’s muted results through the first three quarters of 2025.

Quebec wasn’t alone. Dealers in the Atlantic provinces recorded single-digit declines across the board after outperforming the market for much of the year. Alberta and Manitoba also saw sales fall in October, contributing to a patchwork of provincial results. Andrew King, managing partner at DAC, said sales volatility remains a defining feature of the current landscape.

“Provincial level sales performances can vary significantly depending on market conditions, but the segment level is where the market is most vulnerable to changing market dynamics and where market disruptions can be felt most keenly,” he said in a statement. “Compact car sales, as one example, saw a significant drop in October despite seeing strong growth throughout much of the year.”

King added that while the market is in a turbulent period, shaped by shifting ZEV policies, trade uncertainty, economic softness, pricing pressures and surprising employment growth — October’s overall showing was still respectable. “October itself was actually a solid sales month, just one that ran up against a difficult comparable.”

Nationally, 159,000 new light vehicles were sold in October, down 1.8 per cent from the 162,000 units posted a year earlier.

Samantha Henry, 23d Operational Medical Readiness Squadron public health flight chief.","MOODY AIR FORCE BASE, Ga. — In a demonstration of readiness extending beyond the battlefield, the 23d Medical Group conducted a large-scale public health exercise Nov. 18, 2025, at Moody Air Force Base, Georgia.

The exercise was designed to sharpen medical readiness and force health protection, a commitment to mission endurance reinforced by Mosaic Tiger 26-1. Organized by the 23rd Wing wing inspection team, the exercise brought together multiple base agencies to practice real-world procedures, mirroring the Agile Combat Employment principles of rapid response and distributed operations tested during MT 26-1.

The scenario began with a surge of simulated patients reporting to the 23rd Medical Group clinic with symptoms consistent with foodborne illness following a fictional dining facility event. The rapidly escalating reactions simulated a complex, high-stress environment, demanding immediate communication, medical attention and security action.

""The surge of patients highlighted the urgent need for collaborative organization to ensure that all patients receive the same amounts of high-quality care,"" said Staff Sgt. Jose Alvarez, 23d MDG Community Health noncommissioned officer in charge. ""Our Public Health Airmen demonstrated their adaptability by skillfully conducting patient interviews to close in on our case definition and were able to seamlessly transition to manpower roles to ensure that patients were appropriately placed for the necessary care.""

The key to the exercise’s success was the swift integration of multiple-based agencies. The Public Health team worked closely with installation-wide teams to identify the source of the outbreak and establish proper containment protocols. This interagency cooperation echoes the need to defend bases and protect power projection platforms.

“Preventative Medicine takes place in the shadows,” said Master Sgt. Samantha Henry, 23d Operational Medical Readiness Squadron public health flight chief. “The continuous communication through Force Support Squadron, Defense Commissary Agency, Army and Air Force Exchange Services and Public Health mitigates outbreaks such as the one in the exercise. Because of the foundational work we have established with these agencies, if and when these issues happen, we are confident that our teams will pull together to identify and contain the cause for concern.”

This exercise reinforced the 23rd WG’s operational resilience and its ability to evolve its warfighting unit to meet modern threats. By sharpening Airmen’s ability to respond to complex emergencies and strengthening collaboration across the installation, Moody AFB ensures it can sustain and surge forces in conflict.",https://media.defense.gov/2025/Nov/21/2003830254/2000/2000/0/251119-F-IQ323-2209.JPG,N,0.0,2025-11-21 18:56:58.479462

NHB Tobacco Cessation [360-475-4818] and NHB Health Promotion [360-475-5588] offer tailored support to keep anyone's wellbeing from going up in smoke.","Heard the joke about the servicemember who smoked, dipped, and vaped, who asked his provider one day during a routine physical examination, “What’s the end result of having a nicotine habit?”

“Coffin. Not coughing,” replied the physician.

The servicemember didn’t get it.

Defense Health Agency military treatment facilities like Naval Hospital Bremerton do their best to ensure no servicemember ends up the butt of a bad pun due to nicotine usage.

Towards that goal, NHB’s Health Promotion and Wellness Center, in conjunction with Mental Health Directorate’s Tobacco Cessation counselors, uses the American Cancer Society Great American Smoke Out – held on the third Thursday of November - as a designated date to focus on the perils of puffing, the danger of dipping, and hazards to health from toxic vape vapors.

""The GASO provides a national focal point for our annual public health campaigns and allows us to partner with other healthcare professionals to increase awareness, amplify the risks associated with tobacco and nicotine use and encourage tobacco users to quit, at least for one day, and support breaking the nicotine addiction,"" said Patricia Skiner, Health Promotion and Wellness Center department head.

""Our collaborative approach with Mental Health offers a myriad of cessation support to include education, counseling, resources, and medication,"" Skinner added.

From the initial event in the 1970s when smoking and secondhand smoke were commonplace, the goal remains to reach smokers across the nation to use the date and make a plan to quit, or plan in advance and then quit smoking - and dipping and vaping - for just that one day.

Yet old habits die hard. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the Department of Health, Disability and Ageing and numerous additional highly accredited agencies, nicotine is highly addictive.

Dispelling the prevailing smokescreens is a challenge. Health Promotion's campaign has included several static displays offering visual reminders on nicotine peril.

As an example, there are a host of myths associated with e-cigarettes and vaping. One such falsehood is that most e-cigs do not contain nicotine when in fact most e-cigs do contain nicotine, with some as much nicotine as 20 cigarettes. The American Heart Association notes that another fallacy is that vaping is a safe alternative to smoking. Not so. Most e-cigarettes deliver nicotine, which is highly addictive.

Skinner adamantly pointed out vaping awareness is crucial for understanding misconceptions about the product.

""Many people, especially youth, believe vapes contain only water vapor or harmless flavorings, when in fact, e-cigarette aerosol contains cancer-causing agents, heavy metals and flavorings linked to serious lung diseases,"" explained Skinner, adding that using a vape - also referred to as e-cigarette - product comes with huge health hazard.

""[There's] addiction risks. Vaping can lead to nicotine addiction, which is difficult to break and can make individuals more vulnerable to other substance addictions in the future.""

It's been documented that any type of nicotine usage can compromise not just a user's personal well-being but also affect their own operational readiness status. Quitting improves a person’s night vision, enhances mental activity, increases lung capacity, amongst other gains.

""Brain development and physical health! Nicotine is highly addictive and harmful to the brain and body. Awareness helps prevent issues with attention, learning, mood, and impulse control,"" said Skinner.

Those who smoke, dip or vape can also affect those around them.

""The impact of vaping extends beyond the user! Secondhand aerosol can expose bystanders, like family members, friends, and coworkers to nicotine, volatile organic compounds, like benzene, and heavy metals,"" shared Skinner.

Over the years, NHB’s Substance Abuse Rehabilitation Program team has confronted a variety of reasons why a person started using tobacco. There’s also a host of rationalizations that a user will fall back on to convince others, as well as themselves that it’s okay to still go ahead and smoke or dip. Nicotine does not like to be told what not to do.

Butt, it can be done by anyone who is persistent, patient and passionate to quit.

The Department of Defense YouCanQuite2 program recommends the following six steps to quit vaping [ [https://www.ycq2.org/wp-content/uploads/YouCanQuit2_Quit-Vaping-Factsheet.pdf](https://www.ycq2.org/wp-content/uploads/YouCanQuit2_Quit-Vaping-Factsheet.pdf) ]

Remember why you want to quit.

Maybe you want to quit to break the tie to nicotine or protect your health. Keep that reason in your back pocket at all times. Literally. Make your reason the background on your phone or keep a note in your pocket – personal motivation is powerful when quitting.

Identify triggers.

When you try to quit, certain places (like the bar) or your buddies vaping around you, may make you want to join in. Make a plan to avoid triggers as much as possible and find replacement activities for the times you used to vape.

Fight cravings like a pro.

Some vape products have more nicotine than traditional cigarettes. Know exactly how to fight

nicotine cravings so that when you feel one coming on, you hit the gym, grab some lemon water or call a friend to redirect your attention. Talk to your health care provider about other options such as nicotine replacement therapy.

Talk to your support system.

The people who care about you want to see you succeed. Share how you are feeling - the good, the bad, the ugly and everything in between.

Quit together.

Quitting may not seem like the “cool thing” to do, but as the dangers of vaping become clearer, it’s possible your buddy wants to quit too. Show your strength by asking them to quit with you and let them know it’s easier to quit together.

Celebrate your accomplishments.

Every milestone is important during your quit journey – starting with conquering those first 24

hours vape free. Celebrate these moments because it will help you fight cravings and stress.

Add into the mix that there are even associated smoldering safety fears to consider with using e-cigs. There have been explosions and small fires attributed to them, either due to some type of battery malfunction, overheating, or detonation. Users have been scorched and torched.

NHB’s Tobacco Cessation program - the longest running and most successful in the Navy - has been managed clinically by Substance Abuse Rehabilitation Program counselors since 1998 when it was recognized that nicotine dependence was like alcohol or any other substance and it needed to be treated as such.

We’ll include another somber one-liner to wrap up: Nicotine products are also a leading cause of statistics with over 1,000 people stop smoking, dipping and vaping every day.

Punchline: That's because they've all taken their last breath.

Higher Rates of Autism Found in Kids Whose Parents Served in the Military appeared first on Children’s Health Defense.","By Brenda Baletti, Ph.D.

Children in U.S. military families are diagnosed with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) at higher rates than children in civilian families, according to a new preprint study by scientists at Children’s Health Defense (CHD).

CHD scientists Karl Jablonowski, Ph.D., and Brian Hooker, Ph.D., examined nearly eight years of data from the U.S. Census Bureau’s National Survey of Children’s Health (NSCH).

“The signal for autism in children of U.S. military service personnel has lain undetected in census bureau data for many years. The men and women who serve in our military deserve better,” Jablonowski told The Defender.

“Everyone who wears the uniform knows there is an individual risk to service,” he added. “These findings show there is also a previously unknown risk to the neurological health of their children. ‘The ultimate sacrifice’ has more than one meaning.”

The researchers analyzed more than 330,000 child health records collected between 2016 and 2023, focusing on two questions. Were the children covered by military insurance (Tricare or other military health plans)? And did their parents ever serve in the U.S. Armed Forces, Reserves or National Guard?

They also wanted to know if the parents were male or female, if they were active duty or in the reserves, and if either of those factors affected whether or not the children developed autism.

Among the 333,152 children included in the analysis, 3.19% of children covered by civilian insurance and 4.12% of children covered by Tricare or other military insurance had an ASD diagnosis.

After statistical adjustments, the data showed that children with military insurance were 30.73% more likely to have an ASD diagnosis compared with children covered by civilian insurance. In every year examined, the autism rate for Tricare-insured children was higher than that of their civilian counterparts.

They also found that children of mothers with any military service were 46.19% more likely to be diagnosed with ASD than children whose mothers did not serve in the military.

Children of fathers with any service history were 42.74% more likely to have an ASD diagnosis than children of fathers with no military history.

Among those children, the severity pattern was even more pronounced. Those children were 37.37% more likely to be diagnosed with mild ASD, 45.64% more likely to be diagnosed with moderate ASD and 82.73% more likely to be diagnosed with severe ASD than children whose fathers didn’t serve in the military.

For fathers, the authors documented a clear gradient: the likelihood of ASD was lowest among children of non-military fathers and highest among children whose fathers were deployed while on active duty.

Possible causes ‘must be investigated with all due haste’

The authors argued that because “toxic exposures play a large part in metabolic and neurologic dysfunction,” environmental or occupational exposures associated with military service may contribute to the higher rates of diagnosis.

Although the study does not directly measure such exposures, the authors highlighted several examples of known or suspected hazards within military settings.

Some bases, such as Camp Lejeune, have had drinking water contamination issues in the past.

Other possible toxic exposures include exposure to PFAS (per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances) through firefighting foams; medical exposures unique to deployed environments; or other industrial and environmental toxins generally associated with military operations, and increased vaccination rates among military families.

They suggested that the stronger associations seen with moderate and severe ASD may indicate a “severity-response” pattern consistent with harmful exposures, though they emphasize that more precise data are required to evaluate this possibility.

The authors explained that there could be some bias in the data that affects the results, including: survey bias, where military parents whose children have an ASD diagnosis may be more inclined to complete the National Survey of Children’s Health; selection patterns, where service members may be more or less likely to adopt or care for children with disabilities; or diagnostic differences, where variations in healthcare access or evaluation practices between military and civilian systems may influence how often ASD is identified.

“Though there are several explanations for the results of this analysis, child exposure to toxins, either directly or through their parents, cannot be ignored and must be investigated with all due haste,” the authors wrote.

BACKGROUND

Dyspnea has been described in up to 10–30% of patients post-SARS-CoV-2 infection. The underlying pathology for these persistent symptoms remains poorly understood. This study aimed to characterize changes in cardiopulmonary anatomical structure and physiology that may explain ongoing dyspnea after COVID-19.

METHODS

Participants had a history of symptomatic COVID-19, were between 18 and 65 years of age, and without significant pre-existing cardiopulmonary disease. Each participant underwent prospective chest high resolution computed tomography (HRCT), transthoracic echocardiography (TTE), electrocardiogram (ECG), pulmonary function testing (PFT) with lung volumes and diffusing capacity for carbon monoxide (DLCO), impulse oscillometry (IOS), and a six-minute walk test (6MWT) with Borg dyspnea scoring.

RESULTS

Among 115 enrolled participants, 39 had persistent dyspnea. The mean forced expiratory volume at 1 s/forced vital capacity (FEV1/FVC) ratio was higher in those with persistent dyspnea, but within normal ranges for both groups. There were no other statistically significant differences in FEV1, FVC, and DLCO between the groups. Those with ongoing dyspnea had a decreased walk distance (difference of 50.4 m, P = .01). Resting and post-6MWT Borg scores were 0.9 and 1.3 higher in those with persistent dyspnea, respectively (P-values <.001). There were no significant differences in IOS, HRCT, TTE, or ECG findings between groups.

CONCLUSIONS

This study demonstrated a difference in 6MWT distance and Borg scores between those with and without persistent dyspnea. There were no clear PFT, cardiac test, or HRCT findings that explained these persistent symptoms. Overall, this study demonstrates both subjective and objective differences between those with ongoing dyspnea following COVID-19 that are not explained by standard investigations typically ordered in clinical care for chronic dyspnea. These findings underscore the importance of further research into the etiology of post-COVID-19 dyspnea, including other investigations which may detect more subtle alterations in pulmonary physiology.

Unsere Geschichte:

Die 1889 gegründete Buchhandlung Ernster nahm ihre Geschäftstätigkeit an einem günstig gelegenen Ort in der Oberstadt auf, in der Nähe des Athénée du Luxembourg. Pierre Ernster, der zunächst als Schulbuchautor und Verleger hervorgetreten war, entschied sich dann dafür, die Seite zu wechseln und eröffnete seine eigene Allgemeinbuchhandlung im Zentrum der Hauptstadt in jenem Gebäude, in dem das Unternehmen noch heute seinen Sitz hat.

In den 20er Jahren des letzten Jahrhunderts übernahm sein Sohn Ferdinand die Geschäftsleitung. Nach Ferdinands Tod 1939 führte seine Frau Claire das Unternehmen so gut wie möglich durch die Wirren des Zweiten Weltkriegs.

1958 war es Pit Ernster, der Vater des derzeitigen Geschäftsführers Fernand Ernster, der die Geschäftsanteile seines Bruders und seiner Schwester aufkaufte und so die Weiterführung des Familienbetriebs gewährleistete.

Fernand Ernster trat 1984 im Alter von 24 Jahren in das Unternehmen ein und betrieb die Eröffnung der ersten Buchhandlung der Gruppe in einem Einkaufszentrum, der Belle Etoile. Er trug im Laufe der Zeit zur Expansion und zur Diversifikation der Unternehmenstätigkeiten bei, unter anderem durch die Einführung einer computergestützten Verwaltung. Als erster Betrieb dieser Branche stellte Ernster die Warenwirtschaft auf EDV um, errichtete eine Internetseite und stieg in den Onlinehandel ein. Seit 1999 hält er den Anteil am Unternehmen allein.

2018 stieg Paul, der zweitälteste Sohn, in den Familienbetrieb ein und setzte eine Reihe von Projekten zur Weiterentwicklung des Unternehmens um.

Das Warenangebot beschränkt sich heutzutage nicht mehr auf Schulbücher wie in den Anfangstagen der Buchhandlung Ernster. Die Gruppe umfasst mittlerweile zehn Standorte, die sich an den aktuellen Kundenwünschen orientieren, und beschäftigt mehr als 100 Mitarbeiter. Noch immer als

Select is available to family members everywhere regardless of how close you are to a military installation.

And if you’re being seen on base, I believe you can still switch your plan back to select?

I have the John’s Hopkins in Norfolk. I like it overall, but it can be a pain having to get referrals for everything. I can usually do telehealth with my PCM or with any of their available doctors to get a referral, so I have never had to wait more than a few days for any appt. I’ve had it for two years and don’t plan to change it. I don’t have kids, so can’t speak to that, but I have had to see a few specialists and didn’t have any issues with getting timely appts. The only downside is no one has heard of this insurance, and they’re always confused when I first explain what it is.

Select is available to family members everywhere regardless of how close you are to a military installation. If you are still in your Qualifying Life Event window from moving you can switch immediately. If you’re not, it’s currently open enrollment. You can switch and it takes affect January 1.

When we were stationed in NY, I was on US Family Health Plan under Martins Point. It was the best insurance experience I’ve ever had. I would kill to be back on US Family Health Plan. I could pick any doctor who took it. Never paid for anything out of pocket except for pharmacy which was CHEAP. And due to having a very rare cancer in the past, when it was time for yearly checks, they worked with my doctor outside of coverage range (like over 700 miles away) to cover everything (including CT scans) without needing prior authorization.

“This bipartisan legislation will provide critical transparency to military families, and keep the rug from getting ripped out from under them.
Especially amid rising health care costs in the Hudson Valley and nationwide, we have to be all-hands-on-deck to deliver much-needed relief to military families across the country.
Our military families have stepped up and sacrificed for us, now we need to do right by them.” The introduction of the legislation follows Ryan’s recent reintroduction of the bipartisan “Health Care Fairness for Military Families Act” in July.
Military families and retirees currently face complex healthcare transitions that can cause confusion and unexpected costs, a news release said.","KINGSTON, N.Y. — U.S. Rep Pat Rayan, an Iraq War veteran, has continued his push to help military families by co-sponsoring a bill that, if enacted, would give “adequate, advanced information before any changes to their (healthcare) coverage go into effect,” the congressman’s office said.

Ryan, D-Gardiner, who represents the 18th Congressional District, has co-sponsored the “TRICARE Transition Transparency Act.” It is designed to to ensure “that the rug cannot be ripped out from under military families with regard to their health care, and that they have the time and information they need to plan, budget, and make informed decisions,” his office said in a news release Tuesday.

“Military families have sacrificed so much for this country — it’s absolutely unacceptable that their coverage can be ripped away without notice. It’s entirely un-American,” Ryan said in a statement. “This bipartisan legislation will provide critical transparency to military families, and keep the rug from getting ripped out from under them. Especially amid rising health care costs in the Hudson Valley and nationwide, we have to be all-hands-on-deck to deliver much-needed relief to military families across the country. Our military families have stepped up and sacrificed for us, now we need to do right by them.”

The introduction of the legislation follows Ryan’s recent reintroduction of the bipartisan “Health Care Fairness for Military Families Act” in July. That legislation has not received a vote on the House floor.

The legislation also aims to fix inequities in healthcare by extending TRICARE eligibility to 26-year-olds and saving an estimated 367,000 American military families as much as $8,724 per year in healthcare costs, according to Ryan’s office.

Military families and retirees currently face complex healthcare transitions that can cause confusion and unexpected costs, a news release said.

Under current rules, dependent children lose regular TRICARE eligibility at age 21 (or 23 if enrolled in school). Families may purchase TRICARE Young Adult coverage until age 26, but premiums exceed $570 per month for TYA Prime and $300 per month for TYA Select. At age 65, beneficiaries must enroll in Medicare Part B to maintain TRICARE for Life coverage — a requirement many retirees learn about too late.

“These transitions often come with little advance notice, leading to missed enrollment windows, coverage gaps, and higher out-of-pocket expenses,” the release said. “This bill ensures beneficiaries receive timely, repeated notifications and clear guidance, allowing them to plan ahead, avoid coverage gaps, and manage costs.”

The “TRICARE Transition Transparency Act” will:

• Require the Department of Defense to notify TRICARE beneficiaries one year, 180 days, and 30 days before a coverage change takes effect.

• Apply to any TRICARE coverage transition requirement, including age-based changes like switching from regular TRICARE to TRICARE Young Adult (TYA) at age 21 (or 23 if a full-time student) and transitioning to TRICARE for Life at age 65.

• Mandate that notices be delivered electronically and supported by an outreach campaign through TRICARE’s website, social media, and family readiness groups.

• Require an annual report to Congress with metrics on outreach effectiveness and recommendations for improvement.",https://www.dailyfreeman.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/DFN-L-pat-ryan-hed-01.jpg?w=1024&h=575,N,0.0,2025-11-20 18:56:27.667897

""There was a large list, the carrier was very easy to work with,"" said DeMarco, a mother of three and a behavioral health professional.
Arizona is not new to the managed care model, which means the state does not directly provide or administer most care.
In the Medicare Advantage plans, 55% of listed behavioral health providers were inactive; in Medicaid managed care plans, 28% were inactive.
HHS-OIG surveyed providers to understand why they stop participating in Medicaid managed care and Medicare Advantage networks.","PHOENIX -- Joseph DeMarco was about to turn 19 when he first showed the signs of a severe mental health condition.

By then, his family had already switched insurance plans from TRICARE, a health plan for military personnel, retirees and their families, to Mercy Care, a large nonprofit insurer that contracts with AHCCCS, Arizona's Medicaid program.

Joseph's mother, Seetha DeMarco, said they never struggled to find mental health providers under TRICARE.

""There was a large list, the carrier was very easy to work with,"" said DeMarco, a mother of three and a behavioral health professional. ""I didn't contact a provider that was no longer enrolled with TRICARE.""

Things changed after the switch, she said.

""Each and every time I've contacted Mercy Care to identify a provider in the network, they direct you to a website with a list,"" she said. ""It would take days to go through that list and find a provider that is active and enrolled with Mercy.""

She said they didn't find a competent provider until 2025, nearly 10 years later.

The impact extends beyond inconvenience: without timely care, people with serious mental illness often experience worsening symptoms, instability or repeated crises.

DeMarco's experience reflects what federal investigators have identified as ""ghost networks.""

A ""ghost network is really a directory of providers that's just largely unreachable, out of network or doesn't accept new patients,"" said Meridith Seife, deputy regional inspector general and a co-author of the recent report from the Office of Inspector General (OIG) at the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services.

Companies that operate private Medicare Advantage and Medicaid managed care plans have inflated and inaccurate lists of psychologists, psychiatrists, social workers and other mental health providers they say are available to subscribers, the report found.

That runs counter to federal rules requiring plans to keep their directories current. The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services mandates updates every quarter or within 30 days when a provider's status changes.

Arizona is not new to the managed care model, which means the state does not directly provide or administer most care. The state pioneered Medicaid managed care by creating AHCCCS, the first mandatory statewide program, funded mainly by the federal government, with the remaining quarter covered by the state.

The program's proposed budget for fiscal 2025 is approximately $22.3 billion. Private insurers that contract with AHCCCS to deliver most of the physical and behavioral health services to eligible Arizonans are paid monthly per-member capitation payments from those public funds.

""There was a significant percentage of providers that were inactive, meaning they had not provided a single service throughout an entire year,"" Seife said. ""Almost three-quarters of them should not have been listed in those network directories.""

HHS-OIG reviewed plans across 10 counties in five states, sampling one urban and one rural county in each, targeting ""geographically representative samples around the country."" Urban Maricopa and rural Santa Cruz counties in Arizona were included in the report. In the Medicare Advantage plans, 55% of listed behavioral health providers were inactive; in Medicaid managed care plans, 28% were inactive.

HHS-OIG surveyed providers to understand why they stop participating in Medicaid managed care and Medicare Advantage networks. Many described the administrative workload as overwhelming.

""Keeping up with them (administrative requirements) is nearly impossible and clinical staff feel like they are just cogs in a wheel versus clinicians,"" Seife said.

Other providers cited reimbursement rates that do not cover the cost of care, making continued participation financially unsustainable.

To address these issues, HHS-OIG recommends steps to reduce the administrative requirements and create a centralized, nationwide directory that would be a ""single place that providers could list all the insurance plans they participate in, their correct addresses,"" Seife said.

In a written statement to Cronkite News, AHCCCS acknowledged the challenges and outlined ongoing efforts, stating the agency recognizes ""that timely access to behavioral health services is critical to the well-being of our members, and we share the OIG's commitment to improving transparency and accountability in provider networks.""

The AHCCCS statement highlighted ongoing efforts to improve care access, including increased monitoring of network adequacy, reducing administrative hurdles for providers, investing in behavioral health workforce development and exploring improvements to public-facing provider search tools.

The state agency noted that rural and tribal communities remain the most impacted by provider shortages.

Cronkite News reached out to a number of private insurance companies operating in Arizona; however, none had responded by the time of publication.

As outlined in the TRICARE Choices in the United States Handbook, open season is the annual period when you can enroll or change your health care plan for the following year. This year, TRICARE Open Season began Nov. 10 and ends Dec. 9. Changes you make during open season are effective on Jan. 1, 2026. “Because open season is your chance to switch from one health plan to another, take time to evaluate your choices and determine which plan works best for your family’s health care needs,” said Zelly Zim, senior program analyst, TRICARE Health Plan Policy & Programs Division, at the Defense Health Agency. Who can make changes during open season? Open season applies to you if you’re eligible for one of the following plans: · TRICARE Prime · TRICARE Prime Remote · US Family Health Plan (available only in certain areas) · TRICARE Prime Demo (available only in Atlanta, Georgia and Tampa, Florida areas) · TRICARE Prime Overseas · TRICARE Prime Remote Overseas · TRICARE Select · TRICARE Select Overseas Outside of open season, you can make changes to your health plan when you have a qualifying life event. QLEs include milestones such as marriage, the birth or adoption of a child, becoming eligible for Medicare, gaining or losing other health insurance, and a change in the sponsor’s status such as retirement. A QLE opens a 90-day window where you can make changes to your health plan. Who isn’t eligible to make changes during open season? Remember: Active duty service members must remain on TRICARE Prime and are ineligible to change their plan during open season. Open season also doesn’t apply if you have TRICARE For Life. You’re eligible for TFL as soon as you’re Medicare-eligible and have both Medicare Part A and Part B. Open season also doesn’t apply if you’re eligible for a premium-based plan: · TRICARE Reserve Select · TRICARE Retired Reserve · TRICARE Young Adult · Continued Health Care Benefit Program As long as you’re eligible for one of the premium-based plans listed above, you can enroll at any time during the year. You can also disenroll at any time. Be aware that when you disenroll from a premium-based plan, you’re locked out from enrolling in the plan again for 12 months.
