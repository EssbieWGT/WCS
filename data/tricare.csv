I already have my 20 good years letter.
I understand that if I get rated 30% or more of DoD or DoW whatever it is now, I will get the Tricare for Life/Prime.
I really like Tricare Reserve Select so I assume Tricare for Life is similar.
Will they open up my VA claims again and I have to go through that hassle, or they will omit VA since I'm already VA rated and they will just do the DoD rating?","Hello,

Here is my situation.

20+ years in the Guard with several deployments. I'm already rated at VA 100% P&T. I currently use Tricare Reserve Select for myself and my family. I already have my 20 good years letter. Can experts please tell me what happens if I select to be medboarded out? I understand that if I get rated 30% or more of DoD or DoW whatever it is now, I will get the Tricare for Life/Prime.

Is this Tricare only for my or my spouse/family too? If not, can I pay a difference to get them on this plan? I really like Tricare Reserve Select so I assume Tricare for Life is similar.

If I'm on Tricare for Life after retirement, can I put my family on CHAMPVA?

When I go to the annual PHA (physical health assessment), and I tell them about my conditions they will have no choice but to flag me. That will probably result in medboard actions.

What happens next? Will they open up my VA claims again and I have to go through that hassle, or they will omit VA since I'm already VA rated and they will just do the DoD rating?

What happens if for some reason they rate me lower than 30%?

I already did some research and have a good general understanding of how this process works, but please share it with me anyways so I don't miss anything. Thank you for your responses.",,N,0.0,2025-10-06 19:56:31.523212

Recognition: From Invisible to Indispensable Military spouses were once the “silent ranks,” expected to endure without acknowledgment.
Expanded child care options, commissary delivery services, and inclusive programs for families enrolled in EFMP have also improved daily military life.","For decades, military spouses held families together with handwritten letters, ration books, and slivers of hope. A paycheck might show up late, communication came in thin, blue aerogram envelopes, and recognition rarely extended beyond polite nods at a change of command ceremony.

These challenges have not disappeared, but the way military families meet them has changed. Today’s spouses carry the same grit, determination, and resilience, but they do so with advantages their predecessors could only dream of. Here are seven ways military life for spouses has improved across the generations.

1. Pay and Benefits: From Paper Checks to Predictable Deposits

Older generations of spouses knew the stress of wondering if payday would bring an envelope of cash or another round of IOUs to the landlord (the “poor house” was an actual thing). Today, direct deposit lands on schedule, predictable and steady, while housing allowances and cost-of-living adjustments stretch further than ration books ever could.

While no one pretends military pay will allow you and your friends to vacay in Tahoe, spouses can at least plan a grocery run without hoping the commissary will extend credit until payday.

2. Healthcare Access: To TRICARE and Beyond

There was a time when medical care meant whatever the base clinic could provide and little more. A sick child might have to wait days for a doctor, and specialized care could be out of reach entirely. Now, TRICARE opens doors to networks of providers, expanded mental health care, and even telehealth appointments from the comfort of your living room couch.

It isn’t flawless by any means, as milspouses still experience the frustration of long hold times and billing surprises, but the safety net is stronger and options are wider than what previous generations had to contend with.

3. Communication: From Waiting Weeks to Real-Time Connection

A letter from Vietnam or Korea could take weeks to arrive, often outdated by the time it was read. Families clung to every word like lifelines. Today, military spouses can video call from their bathroom while a deployed partner is halfway around the world. Kids can show off missing teeth over FaceTime, anniversaries can be celebrated with an emoji exchange, and social media groups keep spouses connected across continents.

Distance still has a sting, but anxiously waiting agonizing weeks is no longer the default.

4. Career and Education Opportunities: From Limited Options to Portable Paths

For decades, moving every few years meant starting over again. Careers would dissolve with each relocation, and educational dreams were often shelved.

Today, programs like MyCAA help spouses cover the cost of training, and online universities make degrees more portable. Remote work and interstate licensing agreements mean that more spouses can maintain professional identities, rather than being defined solely by their partner’s service. Progress is uneven, but the doors are more open than they have ever been.

5. Community Support: From Isolation to Infrastructure

Ask anyone who has served, and they will tell you that military life can feel lonely, even in crowded base housing. Support came only if you happened to live next to the right neighbor. Today, there are organized Family Readiness Groups, school liaisons, chaplains, and countless online networks that turn strangers into mentors overnight. A spouse searching for a pediatrician, a babysitter, or just a decent bagel can now find it with a few messages.

Isolation hasn’t magically evaporated, but the pathways out of it are clearer and stronger.

6. Recognition: From Invisible to Indispensable

Military spouses were once the “silent ranks,” expected to endure without acknowledgment. This was often accomplished with aplomb. That silence is slowly being broken. Annual appreciation days, awards that highlight their contributions, and advocacy groups that push for better policies have given spouses more visibility.

They may not yet receive the credit equal to the sacrifices they make (what else is new), but the cultural tide is shifting. What was once hidden labor is now being recognized as essential to readiness and morale, not to mention the mission.

7. Quality of Life: From Bare Bones to Built for Families

Military housing once meant drafty walls, unreliable plumbing, and waiting lists for repairs that stretched further than Black Friday lines. Today’s standards are higher, with accountability measures and renovations aimed at making homes safer and healthier. Expanded child care options, commissary delivery services, and inclusive programs for families enrolled in EFMP have also improved daily military life.

It isn’t perfect; every milspouse has a story of broken appliances or soul-crushing waitlists, but the baseline of comfort has climbed significantly.

We Salute You

The essence of a spouse’s military life has never been about ease for themselves; it has always been about their families first. It has always been about courage, adaptation, and finding strength wherever possible. Today’s spouses still carry that weight of uncertainty, but they do so with steadier paychecks, better healthcare, and stronger networks at their backs.

The generations before proved what was possible with little more than grit and handwritten letters. The generations now continue that mission, equipped with modern tools but the same unshakable resolve. The mission at home has never earned medals or promotions; it may never will, but it is the quiet force that keeps the rest of the mission moving. And for the first time in history, more people are beginning to see it, and to salute the ones who make it possible.",https://www.wearethemighty.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/military-life-operation-homecoming.jpg?quality=85,N,0.0,2025-10-04 21:56:44.821605
