As of Oct. 15, 2025, Military Health System providers will retain their clinical privileges when moving between stateside and overseas military hospitals, clinics, and deployed settings. The new enterprise-wide process reduces administrative burdens and addresses long-standing concerns with the privileging process.

“We needed to increase readiness and increase efficiency in our privileging process,” said Dr. Todd Poindexter, DHA’s chief of credentialing and privileging. “DHA was charged with making changes, and we are no longer requiring an additional privileging action just because a provider moved locations.”

The DHA effort was “an amazing project. I have not seen anything this big, this fast, in the military medical system,” he said. “Almost no one in the country has this ease of movement among facilities — and in this instance, not only among facilities, but even from a military treatment facility to a deployed location.”

DHA’s diligent preparation

Training and education were a vital part in bringing the new process to life.

Leading up to the rollout, DHA trained nearly 1,000 individuals across credentialing and privileging staff, as well as chief medical officers and senior department heads. The multiple training sessions were followed by office hours and an open line for trainee questions.“ It was detailed so that each group knew exactly what was expected of them and how they would be able to do it,” Poindexter said.

DHA then sent out a needs assessment asking the various groups what future things would be most helpful for them. The DHA credentialing and privileging team wanted to “make sure we understood exactly what their further needs were so that we could then provide any additional training to meet the needs of the people who had to fulfill this process,” Poindexter said.

The new system is an exciting industry innovation, he added, and was accomplished in an amazingly short time considering its scale. He also noted that the effort unified all of military medicine for efficient patient care while maintaining appropriate safety mechanisms.

“It applies everywhere, not just DHA,” Poindexter said. “While DHA is responsible for the MTFs, all of those representatives — the surgeon generals, Army, Navy, Air Force and the DHA director — make up one large Military Health System.”

Provider privileging necessary for quality

Privileging is central to clinical quality assurance and patient safety. To acquire privileges, a provider’s scope of practice is determined through a thorough review of their training, accumulated experience, current competence and health status, as well as input from peers and department leaders.

In the past, under an installation-based system, each military hospital or clinic operated its own privileging process, requiring providers to undergo a full review every time they relocated. If a provider’s qualifications and duration of privileges for the same scope of practice were valid at one military hospital or clinic, the process had to be repeated if they moved to another.

According to Poindexter, the overall onboarding process was complicated and could delay patient access to care.

The new goal, he said, is to complete the credentialing and privileging portion of the onboarding process expeditiously with an authorization to practice decision within five business days — ideally, even before the provider gets to the new location — so that there would be no additional credentialing and privileging actions required once “boots are on the ground,” he said, noting this change along with other onboarding process changes ensures well-organized provider transitions.

“By being able to transfer providers more easily and shortening the time it takes for the onboarding process, we’re moving providers more quickly into an operational environment which would increase readiness and force projection,” he said.

‘Significant change’ for faster, more flexible care

Under the revised MHS-wide policy, an approved health care provider will now receive privileges from a MHS privileging authority, which is part of a unified governing body.

“In our old system, every single location was its own entity. When you left, you had to start over. Now, we are operating as a closed system under an overarching MHS governing body,” Poindexter said.

When transferring between MHS entities, health care providers will now sign an attestation for an approved scope of work. System-wide privileges will last for a period of three years.

A health care provider’s current privileges will now remain valid at any MHS entity for the duration of their existing term. Once privileges expire, they can be renewed at the health care provider’s current duty station for a term of three years.

The rigorous standards for earning clinical privileges remain unchanged, and the update does not alter the credentialing requirements or safeguards built into the quality assurance process. Providers will continue to be accountable for safe patient care at whichever facility they are working.

By simplifying movement across the MHS while preserving these protections, Poindexter said the process is designed to speed workflows, reduce delays, and support an agile, unified medical force that can respond swiftly to operational demands.

He credited the effort to a “great DHA team. There were so many people who have worked really hard on this. We have been a part of a very significant change.”",https://www.militaryspot.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/DHA.png,N,1.0,2026-01-06 18:57:13.919646

As winter illnesses increase across the nation, Munson leaders stress that proper handwashing is one of the most effective ways to reduce the spread of flu and other winter illnesses, helping keep our Force and families healthy and ready. see less | View Image Page

FORT LEAVENWORTH, Kansas — As cold and flu season progresses across the Midwest, Munson Army Health Center encourages service members, families, retirees, and federal employees to join in a proactive effort to reduce illness and strengthen community readiness.

The new campaign — “Winter Ready. Mission Ready.” — emphasizes that protecting health is tied directly to readiness on and off duty.

“Whether on the range, worksite, in classrooms, the community or at home, staying healthy impacts how well we perform and how strong our installation remains,” said Col. Jolanda L.J. Walker, Munson Army Health Center, director and installation Force Health Protection proponent.

“Readiness starts with basic steps — washing hands, staying home when sick, and staying rested. Every member of our community plays a part.”

The initiative focuses on five actions that provide the strongest defense against winter illness: • Frequent handwashing and cleaning high touch surfaces • Covering coughs and sneezes • Staying home when fever or flu-like symptoms appear • Prioritizing sleep, hydration, and nutritious food for a strong immune system • Receiving the flu vaccine, available at Munson or TRICARE-approved providers

Munson leaders note that winter illness not only affects individual health — it can lead to lost duty time, reduced operational capability, and strain on military families.

“Protecting the health of our force is a shared community responsibility,” Walker said. “That includes service members, spouses, children, retirees, and the civilian workforce. Mission success depends on a healthy community.”

Beneficiaries are encouraged to seek medical guidance when symptoms worsen, or if they have prolonged fever.

To schedule an appointment for acute symptoms or illness contact Munson’s call center between 7:15 a.m.-3:45 p.m. at 913 684-6250 or use the MHS GENESIS Patient Portal 24/7 at https://patientportal.mhsgenesis.health.mil.

The TRICARE Nurse Advice Line (1-800-TRICARE) is available 24/7 to support care decisions and locate after-hours urgent care.

TRICARE beneficiaries aged 6 months and older who still need a flu shot can stop by the Department of Primary Care Wednesdays and Thursdays from 8 – 11:30 a.m. to receive a flu shot. Department of Defense Identification Cards are required for patients aged 10 years and older.

There are also two types of non-network providers: participating providers and nonparticipating providers.
Non-network providers Non-network providers are also TRICARE-authorized providers.
Nonparticipating providers are non-network providers who haven’t agreed to accept the TRICARE-allowable charge as payment in full for services.
However, charges above the TRICARE-allowable charge don’t count toward your catastrophic cap.","You may have heard the terms “allowable charge” and “balance billing.” But what do these terms mean when you have TRICARE?

The TRICARE-allowable charge is the maximum amount TRICARE will pay for a procedure, service, or equipment. TRICARE-allowable charges vary based on the provider and the type, place, and date of service. The TRICARE-allowable charge determines what you’ll pay for your TRICARE cost-share.

Balance billing is when a provider bills you for the difference between what they charge for a service (often called the “billed amount” or “billed charges”) and the TRICARE-allowable charge for that service.

Is a provider allowed to bill you for this difference? It depends on what type of provider they are.

There are two types of TRICARE-authorized providers: network providers and non-network providers. There are also two types of non-network providers: participating providers and nonparticipating providers.

“Only nonparticipating providers are allowed to practice balance billing,” said Ashli Van De Weert, health systems specialist, TRICARE Health Plan, at the Defense Health Agency. “In the U.S. and U.S. territories, these providers can’t charge you more than 15% of the TRICARE-allowable charge.”

Keep reading to learn more about different types of TRICARE-authorized providers and what they’re allowed to charge you.

Network providers

A network provider is a TRICARE-authorized provider who has signed an agreement with your regional contractor to follow TRICARE policies and procedures. This means they:

Accept a negotiated rate as payment in full

File claims so that you don’t have to

Won’t ask you to sign any documents to make you pay amounts above your copayment or cost-share — if this happens, contact your regional contractor.

Non-network providers

Non-network providers are also TRICARE-authorized providers. These providers haven’t signed a formal agreement with your regional contractor. Because of this, they may see TRICARE patients on a case-by-case basis.

Participating providers are non-network providers who accept the TRICARE-allowable charge as payment in full for covered health care services. This means that after you meet your deductible, you’ll only pay a cost-share when you visit the provider. In the U.S., these providers will file claims for you.

Nonparticipating providers are non-network providers who haven’t agreed to accept the TRICARE-allowable charge as payment in full for services. They also haven’t agreed to file claims for you.

What does this mean for you?

When you see a nonparticipating provider, you may have to pay the full amount to the provider up front and file a claim with TRICARE for reimbursement. (TRICARE won’t reimburse you for deductibles, cost-shares, and charges above the TRICARE-allowable charge.)

In the U.S., nonparticipating providers have the legal right to charge you up to 15% more than the TRICARE-allowable charge. (This doesn’t apply if you sign a statement agreeing to pay more than the allowable charge.)

This is in addition to any deductibles or cost-shares you pay. Overseas, there may be no limit to how much a nonparticipating provider may bill you. You’re responsible for paying any amount that’s more than the TRICARE-allowable charge.

Tip: Before you see a non-network provider, call the provider to see if they participate in TRICARE.

Making sure you don’t overpay

It’s important to make sure your provider isn’t making you pay more than they’re allowed to. This means that you should check your TRICARE explanation of benefits when you get a bill from a nonparticipating provider.

Your EOB will show you the provider’s billed amount (what they charge for the care). It will also show the TRICARE-allowable charge for the care you got, and the cost-share you paid. Your cost-share is the portion of the TRICARE-allowable charge that you’ll need to pay.

Here’s an example. A nonparticipating provider in the U.S. bills $1,000 for a service. The TRICARE-allowable charge for this service is $850. By law, the provider can ask you to pay $127.50 (15% of $850), in addition to your deductible and cost-share.

If you’re being billed for more than 15% of the allowable charge or if you’ve already paid more than this, you should call your regional contractor.

Tips for choosing a provider

Are you deciding whether to see a network or non-network provider? Keep these things in mind.

Out-of-pocket costs: In general, you’ll pay less out of pocket when you see a network provider than you will if you see a non-network provider. Go to Health Plan Costs to compare network and non-network costs.

Your plan’s rules: Different TRICARE plans have different rules for seeing non-network providers. If you don’t follow these rules, you may pay more out of pocket. Go to Non-Network Providers and Book Appointments to learn more.

Your catastrophic cap: The catastrophic cap is the most you or your family may pay out of pocket for covered TRICARE health services each calendar year. It limits the amount of out-of-pocket expenses you pay for covered services, as noted in the TRICARE Costs and Fees Sheet. However, charges above the TRICARE-allowable charge don’t count toward your catastrophic cap.

Kelly, USAF (Ret), and members of MOAA’s Government Relations team met with senior military health system leaders last month and urged them to reconsider the decision to revoke TRICARE For Life (TFL) coverage of some GLP-1 drugs.

MOAA requested the meeting after the White House announced agreements with pharmaceutical manufacturers Eli Lilly and Co. and Novo Nordisk to dramatically reduce the prices of GLP-1 drugs that help adults struggling with diabetes, heart disease, obesity, and other medical conditions.

TRICARE will benefit from the administration’s newly negotiated lower prices for GLP-1 medications, Pentagon officials said. They indicated analyses are underway to determine how these reduced prices may affect the Defense Health Program budget and TFL coverage policy moving forward.

Kelly emphasized the extraordinary levels of engagement and outreach from both impacted patients who have lost GLP-1 coverage and other beneficiaries who fear future cuts to the retiree health care benefit. More than 600 TRICARE beneficiaries have contacted MOAA to share their feedback on the MHS decision to revoke coverage of certain GLP-1 drugs from TFL beneficiaries.

Under the administration’s new pricing framework, Medicare costs for Ozempic, Wegovy, Mounjaro, and Zepbound will be $245, less than half the previous cost. State Medicaid programs also will have access to these medications at these prices. Lower negotiated prices for Medicare and Medicaid patients may prompt expanded access through pilot programs as early as this spring.

For Medicare patients, pilot program coverage of GLP-1 medications will be under Medicare Part D prescription drug plans.

Before the Aug. 31, 2025, policy change that revoked GLP-1 coverage for TFL, beneficiaries who met stringent prior-authorization criteria — including documented comorbid conditions such as hypertension, sleep apnea, or metabolic dysfunction — could be approved for GLP-1 medications. TRICARE Prime and Select users retain this coverage with prior authorization, and all beneficiaries still receive GLP-1 coverage when the drug is prescribed for Type 2 diabetes.

MOAA continues to be a steadfast advocate for restoring GLP-1 coverage under TFL.

“We anticipate the introduction of a freestanding bipartisan bill this month to provide these services for the military,” he said.","(The Center Square) – Illinois U.S. Sen. Tammy Duckworth, D-Schaumburg, criticizes the House speaker and the president after a provision expanding in-vitro fertilization coverage for military families was stripped from the defense bill. Opponents cite cost, capacity and ethical concerns.

Sean Tipton, chief advocacy and policy officer for the American Society for Reproductive Medicine, said Speaker Mike Johnson’s decision was rooted in ideology rather than fiscal realities.

“This provision passed in an overwhelming bipartisan way in both the House and the Senate,” said Tipton. “And the speaker just decided he was going to take it out. It’s undemocratic. It’s cruel to the military.”

Critics, including David Smith of the Illinois Family Institute, argue the federal government should not require taxpayers to fund IVF, which they view as an elective medical procedure.

“Taxpayers should not be funding this dubious medical procedure,” said Smith. “This is an elective medical treatment, and the government has no business expanding into that kind of care.”

In a video circulating on social media, Duckworth called on lawmakers to restore the provision.

“It should be a no-brainer that we pass IVF benefits for our military men and women and their families,” said Duckworth in the video. “The people who deserve IVF first and foremost are the men and women who go to war to defend us.”

Tipton said Duckworth’s experience as a wounded combat veteran and a mother who used IVF gives her firsthand understanding of how fertility care affects service members and military retention.

The provision would have expanded TRICARE, the military’s health insurance program, to cover IVF services for service members and their families. Tipton rejected claims that including IVF would “crowd out” other healthcare services, arguing that providing fertility care would not prevent the military from funding essential medical treatments for service members.

“I cannot follow the logic of that at all,” Tipton said. “That’s like saying if you treat a patient’s flu and don’t let them die from it, eventually you’re going to have to pay for the next disease they get. Any excuse is a lie other than his specific religious objections to reproductive healthcare. Providing healthcare for the military costs money. You can’t expect people to serve and then not get healthcare.”

Advocates of taxpayer-funded IVF projected the expansion would cost about $1.6 billion over 10 years, arguing it would be a relatively small investment to support military morale and retention.

“Most people in the military are young, generally under 25, so the need for IVF is likely limited,” Tipton said. “But for highly specialized personnel, such as fighter pilots, the military has invested significant time and resources in their training. Fertility benefits can be an important incentive for those service members to remain in the military.”

Some Republican lawmakers, including Congressmen Matt Rosendale of Montana and Josh Breechen of Oklahoma, however, have cited estimates closer to $1 billion per year.

Smith said taxpayer-funded IVF goes beyond the military’s essential responsibilities.

“The military healthcare system should focus on catastrophic illnesses and essential needs,” Smith said. “Not elective procedures that should be left to the private sector.”

TRICARE currently limits fertility coverage to service members whose infertility is a result of illness or injury sustained while on active duty.

Tipton said the debate is likely to continue.

“We anticipate the introduction of a freestanding bipartisan bill this month to provide these services for the military,” he said. “This debate isn’t over.”",https://insurancenewsnet.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/inn-social-default.jpg,N,1.0,2026-01-06 12:56:40.513200

What has changed for provider privileging?
With this change, the MHS removes the red tape and empowers our health providers to deliver health services faster and enhances readiness.
To help with this process, the Defense Health Agency will provide: Training materials Implementation guides Role-specific job for providers and for privileging staff Has the Privileging Process or Quality Management Rigor Changed?
The initial and renewal privileging process for providers isn’t changing.","What is provider privileging?

Provider privileging is the process where a health care organization grants a provider permission to provide medical and other patient care services. Clinical privileges are based on their:

Licensure

Relevant training and experience

Current competence, health status, and judgment

Peer and department head recommendations

Privileging is an essential part of the MHS clinical quality assurance and management programs.

What has changed for provider privileging?

The Military Health System now allows MHS providers to carry their privileges between facilities. With this change, the MHS removes the red tape and empowers our health providers to deliver health services faster and enhances readiness.

The new process will allow providers moving to new locations within the MHS to resume providing care at a much faster rate, allowing providers to see more patients and contributing to a medically ready force.

These new rules apply when a provider moves to an overseas location or between countries, and when providers deploy.

What else do I need to know?

Your current clinical privileges are valid at any MHS facility, including hospitals and clinics in deployed locations.

You’ll be privileged to the top of your respective credentials and competencies. The facility will have evidence of your current competencies and training.

There’s no need for site-specific privileges triggered because you move.

When your current privileges expire, your current duty station will renew them. This renewal is valid for up to three years.

MHS privileges apply to active duty and civilian employee providers. System-wide privileging for the Reserve Components not on extended active duty will be in place no later than May 27, 2026.

To help with this process, the Defense Health Agency will provide:

Training materials

Implementation guides

Role-specific job for providers and for privileging staff

Has the Privileging Process or Quality Management Rigor Changed?

No, the new system will apply the same rigor and clinical quality management and oversight as the old system. The initial and renewal privileging process for providers isn’t changing. Providers simply won't have to repeat it when they practice at a new facility or in an operational environment.

Providers must sign an attestation at each MHS facility where they practice.",https://dha.mil/-/media/Project/Images/8817438.jpg,N,0.0,2026-01-06 15:12:14.280517

While fireworks painted the sky over Joint Base Lewis-McChord, a different kind of celebration was unfolding within the hospital’s walls. At exactly 12:17 a.m., the first cries of a newborn baby named Hunter echoed through the halls, marking his arrival as the first baby of the year for the esteemed medical center.

A Historic Welcome

For Hunter’s first-time parents, the traditional New Year’s festivities were replaced by an experience far more profound. They ushered in 2026 not with toasts and confetti, but in the warm and capable company of the Madigan Labor and Delivery staff, witnessing the miracle of their son’s birth. The event was a heartwarming beginning to the year for both the new family and the hospital community. Madigan Army Medical Center, one of the largest military hospitals on the West Coast, has a long and storied history of serving the nation’s service members and their families. Originally designated as Fort Lewis General Hospital to treat Pacific theater casualties during World War II, it was officially named Madigan General Hospital in 1944. The birth of the New Year’s baby is a cherished tradition, a symbol of hope and new beginnings that resonates deeply within the close-knit Joint Base Lewis-McChord community.

The Symbolism of the First Baby

The tradition of celebrating the “Baby New Year” is a practice with ancient roots, dating back to Greece around 600 B.C., as a symbol of rebirth. Over the centuries, the image of a baby has come to represent the promise of a fresh start, a clean slate, and the bright potential of the year ahead. In modern times, the first baby born in a hospital often receives media attention and sometimes even gifts, a cheerful custom that highlights the communal joy in welcoming new life. For the staff at Madigan, Hunter’s arrival was a poignant reminder of the life-affirming work they do every day, providing care and support to the families of those who serve.

A Joyful Start for All

The arrival of a new baby is always a cause for celebration, but a New Year’s baby carries a unique and public joy. It serves as a beautiful and unifying event, bringing together patients, staff, and the wider community in a shared moment of happiness. Madigan Army Medical Center, a facility that has witnessed countless moments of courage and healing, began its year with a story of pure joy. Heartfelt congratulations are extended to the proud new parents and their son, Hunter.

City officials confirmed the arrival after flight‑tracking data revealed the aircraft’s route from Joint Base Charleston to Puerto Rico and then to Texas.

The injured U.S. troops are being treated at a San Antonio military hospital. San Antonio Mayor Gina Ortiz Jones confirmed the arrival of the wounded soldiers at BAMC.

Mayor Jones confirmed the arrival of the troops in an interview with KENS 5 on Monday, saying, “My thoughts are with those soldiers that are currently receiving care for those injuries.”

Flight tracking software indicated a suspected medevac flight departed Joint Base Charleston on Saturday, bound for Aguadilla, Puerto Rico. The aircraft, a C-17A Globemaster bearing call sign #AE20C7, departed BQN in Aguadilla to Joint Base San Antonio.

An unknown number of injured soldiers suffering minor injuries and shrapnel wounds were transported to BAMC shortly after arriving in San Antonio. BAMC is reported to be the sole Level I Trauma Center within the military health system. The facility played a critical role in treating severe combat casualties sustained during conflicts in Iraq and Afghanistan. The hospital also has a specialty ward designated for the U.S. Army’s Institute for Surgical Research (USAISR), a renowned burn treatment center.

On Sunday, President Donald Trump spoke to pool reporters aboard Air Force One about the soldiers injured during Operation Absolute Resolve, saying they were in “good shape.” The president added that the military action was a “very dangerous operation.” Few details have emerged concerning the number of wounded or the exact extent of the injuries. Breitbart Texas contacted Brooke Army Medical Center, but calls went unanswered as of press time.

During a Saturday press briefing, President Trump indicated the United States military suffered no fatalities during the operation that involved more than 150 military aircraft from across the Western Hemisphere. The daring raid on a military facility in Caracas to capture the Venezuelan dictator saw troops taking ground fire from anti-aircraft batteries that were soon destroyed by U.S. military helicopters. According to administration officials, at least one American chopper was hit, not shot down, by Venezuelan ground troops.

The precision of the military action involved advanced fighter jets, including USAF F-22s, F-35s, and B-1 Bombers, as well as multiple rotary-wing aircraft and unmanned drones. Secretary of War Pete Hegseth lauded the successful coordination of military assets during the complex operation at Saturday’s press event in Mar-a-Lago. Hegseth, who took the podium after President Trump completed his comments, told reporters, “What I witnessed last night was sheer guts and grit, gallantry and glory of the American warrior. … This is about the safety, security, freedom, and prosperity of the American people. This is America first; this is peace through strength; and the United States War Department is proud to help deliver it.”",https://www.breitbart.com/favicon.png,N,0.0,2026-01-06 18:57:17.685161

Today's Big Stories

1. Scores of new state laws take effect

While the state’s new Green Fee has attracted national attention as the country’s first tax specifically established to help mitigate and respond to the effects of climate change, a host of other newly enacted legislation have also taken effect in Hawaii, among them new laws governing how macadamia nuts are labeled, oversight of fundraising platforms, parking near crosswalks and intersections and tax exemptions for services covered by Medicare, Medicaid and TRICARE.

Act 96 (formerly Senate Bill 1396) increases the existing transient accommodations tax rate by 0.75% beginning in 2026 and levies, for the first time, the TAT on cruise ships that port in the state. Funds generated by the Green Fee, projected at $100 million per year, will be used to build resiliency against the impacts of climate change by funding environmental stewardship, hazard mitigation and sustainable tourism.

The fee was recommended by the state’s Climate Advisory Team, which was established in the wake of the deadly 2023 Maui wildfires to identify ways to respond to the growing frequency and intensity of natural disasters in the state.

“Visitors who benefit from our island’s resources have a shared responsibility to help preserve them,” Gov. Josh Green said in advance of the law taking effect on Jan. 1. “The Green Fee ensures that the resources needed to protect Hawaii are available for future generations.”

Also taking effect on Thursday was Act 199 (House Bill 2278), passed in 2024, which requires macadamia nuts that were not grown in Hawaii to be labeled as such in items in which macadamia nuts are the predominant ingredient.

ACT 47 (SB 1035) acknowledges that while medical services rendered at a nonprofit hospital, infirmary, or sanitarium are exempt from the general excise tax, the same services rendered by individual or group practices or clinics are fully taxable. This leads to unequal compensation for health care providers as government programs Medicare, Medicaid, and TRICARE do not compensate for the difference created by the general excise tax.

Under Act 47, medical and dental services provided by health care providers to patients who receive Medicaid, Medicare, or TRICARE benefits are now exempted.

2. Honolulu police log 592 fireworks-related calls over New Year’s; two arrests made

Over the New Year’s holiday, Honolulu police officers responded to nearly 600 fireworks-related calls and arrested two individuals for fireworks violations.

Honolulu police fielded 592 calls for fireworks-related violations around the island between Dec. 31, 2025, at 6 p.m. and Jan. 1, 2026, at 6 a.m. Last year during the same period, HPD had only received 395 calls for fireworks violations.

""The increase in calls for service related to fireworks violations shows progress as we have been asking for more eyes in the community,"" said HPD’s Regional Patrol Bureau Assistant Chief Brian Lynch in an email to Spectrum News Hawaii. ""We want to thank those who called 911 to report illegal fireworks. Your partnership makes a real difference in keeping our community safe.""

HPD officers also arrested two individuals and issued 29 citations for fireworks violations. Officers arrested one individual for allegedly lighting an illegal aerial firework, and they arrested the other person for allegedly using firecrackers without a permit.

Also during this time, HPD logged 1,473 total calls for service and made 121 arrests for both fireworks and non-fireworks incidents.

The DLE also had 12 drones in operation above Oahu. A law passed in 2025 now allows for the use of aerial drone images to establish probable cause for arrest.

“We still have hours of drone video and numerous tips to go through, and we will work with the Attorney General’s office to put the property owners on notice,” said Mike Lambert, director of state law enforcement.

3. Rare Hawaii snowfall piles up on Maunakea

While most of the state of Hawaii is experiencing wet and cold weather, on Hawaii’s tallest peak, Maunakea, it's below freezing, creating a thick blanket of snow.

Overnight on Monday, the summit area of Maunakea on Hawaii Island received 8 to 10 inches of snowfall, according to Nahua Guilloz, who is the director of stewardship programs at the University of Hawaii at Hilo’s Center for Maunakea Stewardship.

“It is currently still snowing on the summit,” wrote Guilloz, who emailed Spectrum News Hawaii on Monday at 11:25 a.m.

Because of the snow and ice, the road to the summit is closed. The Maunakea Stewardship’s utilities crew is working to clear the snow with a snow blower, two snow plows and a front-end loader.

“There is still forecasted a lot of rain for today and overnight, so we expect that there will be more snow to clear tomorrow,” Guilloz added.

Hawaii Island's summit reaches into the sky at 13,500 feet above sea level, and it usually snows there a few times each year.

4. Kauai Community College offers scholarship for high school seniors

Aiming to make college more affordable and accessible for graduating Kauai high school seniors in the Class of 2026, Kauai Community College has launched the Hoʻolei Scholarship to cover the first year of tuition.

Available to eligible students after financial aid is applied, the scholarship is for seniors graduating from a public high school or charter school on Kauai, who enroll directly with Kauai CC, according to a release.

“Hoʻolei is about opening doors, removing financial barriers, and helping our local students take the next step toward their future right here at home,” said Kauai CC Chancellor Margaret Sanchez in the release.

The scholarship has over $100,000 to support students thanks to donations, along with additional support from the Stupski Foundation.

Students must apply online and complete the 2026 to 2027 Free Application for Federal Student Aid. Once both steps have been completed, eligible students will automatically be considered for the Hoʻolei Scholarship.

According to the release, financial aid already covers full tuition for most students at Kauai CC. For those who have remaining tuition after aid is applied, the scholarship will cover the rest of their first-year tuition.

5. Free workshop on Jan. 17 for caregivers of those on the 'cancer journey'

Designed to acknowledge, uplift and educate caregivers — ""the unsung heroes of the cancer journey"" — the Susan C. Hirano Cancer CARE Community of the University of Hawaii Cancer Center presents a free interactive workshop on Saturday, Jan. 17.

Also open to patients, survivors and family members, the ""Caring for Caregivers"" workshop is from 8 a.m. to 11 a.m. at the Sullivan Conference Center, UH Cancer Center at 701 Ilalo Street in Honolulu. It's free and open to the public, with the deadline to register by Jan. 9.

According to the news release, roughly one in four adults are family caregivers in Hawaii, who must often shoulder enormous logistical, physical and emotional challenges. The workshop recognizes caregivers by offering practical tools, information and connections to the community and resources that will help caregivers care for themselves while continuing to care for others.

The test of the Operational Medicine Care Delivery Platform (OpMed CDP) was conducted between Dec. 1 and Dec. 12 aboard the Arleigh Burke-class destroyer USS Carney.
The effort was led by Navy Medicine, which includes more than 44,000 military and civilian health care professionals supporting forces at sea and ashore.
OpMed CDP was developed by the Joint Operational Medicine Information System (JOMIS) under the Program Executive Office for Defense Healthcare Management Systems as part of a broader modernization of military health information technology.

The test of the Operational Medicine Care Delivery Platform (OpMed CDP) was conducted between Dec. 1 and Dec. 12 aboard the Arleigh Burke-class destroyer USS Carney. The effort was led by Navy Medicine, which includes more than 44,000 military and civilian health care professionals supporting forces at sea and ashore.

OpMed CDP was developed by the Joint Operational Medicine Information System (JOMIS) under the Program Executive Office for Defense Healthcare Management Systems as part of a broader modernization of military health information technology.

The pilot was carried out in partnership with the Navy Bureau of Medicine and Surgery, U.S. Fleet Forces Command, Commander, Naval Surface Force Atlantic, Commander, Naval Medical Forces Atlantic, and JOMIS to evaluate the system’s functionality for fleet use.

During the trial, Carney’s crew received training designed to help users document and access electronic health records efficiently. The system is intended to support a range of medical functions, including pharmacy services, laboratory work, and routine medical visits, while maintaining connectivity with the Military Health System’s MHS GENESIS platform.

“The JOMIS ecosystem will transform the way our clinicians, physicians, and corpsmen provide care to warfighters in operational settings to maintain patient data flow through the continuum of care,” said. Lt. Cmdr. Erik Lawrence, the Navy’s chief nursing informatics officer for JOMIS, said in a statement.

Lawrence added that the system is intended to improve continuity of care in operational environments.

Hospital Corpsman 3rd Class Johnny Percadoni, assigned to Carney, said the hands-on training allowed crew members to provide feedback as they learned the new system.

“We’re still learning how it works, but the team has been really helpful with answering questions and listening to feedback,” Percadoni said. “It’s a different day and a new system, but I think it’s going to become a lot more prevalent and useful for us.”

Following the initial test, Naval Surface Force Atlantic approved moving OpMed CDP into an extended pilot phase to further assess its performance and reliability.

Cmdr. John de Geus, the Navy’s chief health informatics officer, said the software has been developed over the past three and a half years to support medical decision-making and provide data to operational commanders in real time.

“A successful fielding isn’t just about delivering software; it’s about delivering the right capability,” de Geus said.

Once all testing phases are complete, Carney is expected to become the first ship to use OpMed CDP for daily medical operations. Navy officials said the phased fielding approach is intended to support a disciplined rollout across the fleet while incorporating user feedback and aligning with operational readiness cycles.",https://meritalk.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/shutterstock_3558313-min.jpg,N,0.0,2026-01-05 18:56:23.500878

The new enterprise-wide process reduces administrative burdens and addresses long-standing concerns with the privileging process.
“We needed to increase readiness and increase efficiency in our privileging process,” said Dr. Todd Poindexter, DHA’s chief of credentialing and privileging.
When transferring between MHS entities, health care providers will now sign an attestation for an approved scope of work.
A health care provider’s current privileges will now remain valid at any MHS entity for the duration of their existing term.","Through meticulous, rigorous training, the Defense Health Agency launched a streamlined provider-privileging process that allows health care providers to care for patients right away in any military hospital or clinic.

As of Oct. 15, 2025, Military Health System providers will retain their clinical privileges when moving between stateside and overseas military hospitals, clinics, and deployed settings. The new enterprise-wide process reduces administrative burdens and addresses long-standing concerns with the privileging process.

“We needed to increase readiness and increase efficiency in our privileging process,” said Dr. Todd Poindexter, DHA’s chief of credentialing and privileging. “DHA was charged with making changes, and we are no longer requiring an additional privileging action just because a provider moved locations.”

The DHA effort was “an amazing project. I have not seen anything this big, this fast, in the military medical system,” he said. “Almost no one in the country has this ease of movement among facilities — and in this instance, not only among facilities, but even from a military treatment facility to a deployed location.”

DHA’s diligent preparation

Training and education were a vital part in bringing the new process to life.

Leading up to the rollout, DHA trained nearly 1,000 individuals across credentialing and privileging staff, as well as chief medical officers and senior department heads. The multiple training sessions were followed by office hours and an open line for trainee questions.“ It was detailed so that each group knew exactly what was expected of them and how they would be able to do it,” Poindexter said.

DHA then sent out a needs assessment asking the various groups what future things would be most helpful for them. The DHA credentialing and privileging team wanted to “make sure we understood exactly what their further needs were so that we could then provide any additional training to meet the needs of the people who had to fulfill this process,” Poindexter said.

The new system is an exciting industry innovation, he added, and was accomplished in an amazingly short time considering its scale. He also noted that the effort unified all of military medicine for efficient patient care while maintaining appropriate safety mechanisms.

“It applies everywhere, not just DHA,” Poindexter said. “While DHA is responsible for the MTFs, all of those representatives — the surgeon generals, Army, Navy, Air Force and the DHA director — make up one large Military Health System.”

Provider privileging necessary for quality

Privileging is central to clinical quality assurance and patient safety. To acquire privileges, a provider’s scope of practice is determined through a thorough review of their training, accumulated experience, current competence and health status, as well as input from peers and department leaders.

In the past, under an installation-based system, each military hospital or clinic operated its own privileging process, requiring providers to undergo a full review every time they relocated. If a provider’s qualifications and duration of privileges for the same scope of practice were valid at one military hospital or clinic, the process had to be repeated if they moved to another.

According to Poindexter, the overall onboarding process was complicated and could delay patient access to care.

The new goal, he said, is to complete the credentialing and privileging portion of the onboarding process expeditiously with an authorization to practice decision within five business days — ideally, even before the provider gets to the new location — so that there would be no additional credentialing and privileging actions required once “boots are on the ground,” he said, noting this change along with other onboarding process changes ensures well-organized provider transitions.

“By being able to transfer providers more easily and shortening the time it takes for the onboarding process, we're moving providers more quickly into an operational environment which would increase readiness and force projection,” he said.

‘Significant change’ for faster, more flexible care

Under the revised MHS-wide policy, an approved health care provider will now receive privileges from a MHS privileging authority, which is part of a unified governing body.

“In our old system, every single location was its own entity. When you left, you had to start over. Now, we are operating as a closed system under an overarching MHS governing body,” Poindexter said.

When transferring between MHS entities, health care providers will now sign an attestation for an approved scope of work. System-wide privileges will last for a period of three years.

A health care provider’s current privileges will now remain valid at any MHS entity for the duration of their existing term. Once privileges expire, they can be renewed at the health care provider’s current duty station for a term of three years.

The rigorous standards for earning clinical privileges remain unchanged, and the update does not alter the credentialing requirements or safeguards built into the quality assurance process. Providers will continue to be accountable for safe patient care at whichever facility they are working.

By simplifying movement across the MHS while preserving these protections, Poindexter said the process is designed to speed workflows, reduce delays, and support an agile, unified medical force that can respond swiftly to operational demands.

He credited the effort to a “great DHA team. There were so many people who have worked really hard on this. We have been a part of a very significant change.""",https://d1ldvf68ux039x.cloudfront.net/thumbs/photos/2601/9468545/1000w_q95.jpg,N,1.0,2026-01-05 18:56:26.423182

The overarching theme reveals a systemic challenge within the Marine Corps recruitment framework, where the drive for high enlistment numbers often places ethical considerations in precarious balance.","Recruiting efforts for the Marine Corps in certain regions of the United States, particularly the Rust Belt, have faced significant challenges, culminating in reports of widespread fraudulent practices among recruiters. A recent investigation by Business Insider into the 4th Marine Corps District has uncovered alarming instances of rule-breaking, including the use of forged police records and fake medical documentation.

Interviews with two recruiters who were dismissed due to their involvement in these activities reveal the intense pressures faced by staff. One of the former recruiters, Staff Sgt. Calvin Grimes, provided insight into the tactics employed within the recruiting environment, including the creation of electronic templates used to forge a variety of documents such as medical clearances and diplomas. He described the internal turmoil of having to engage in deceit, stating, “You have to live with that feeling that your heart’s beating out of your chest ready to explode.”

The investigation highlighted that of the ten Marines in the field between 2018 and 2024, five admitted to engaging in unethical practices to meet their monthly goal of enlisting two new recruits. The pressures intensified during the COVID-19 pandemic, which posed further complications in reaching potential candidates as traditional recruiting avenues were disrupted.

Moreover, the introduction of the Military Health System Genesis created additional hurdles for recruiters. This medical data system flagged applicants for minor issues that could lead to extended delays in the enlistment process. As a result, recruiters felt compelled to expedite applications through unethical means, like forging documents to bypass these obstacles.

The culture surrounding recruitment pressures was vividly illustrated by former Gunnery Sgt. Logan Krivak, who, during his tenure in the Marines, faced the fraught dynamics of an amped-up demand to deliver results amid overwhelming stress. Reflecting on his experience, Krivak noted that the environment had shifted over time, leading some to question the integrity of their work. His own experience with faking a required police document led to an investigation and ultimate dismissal, which he stated left him feeling conflicted about the morality of his actions versus the expectations set by his superiors.

Grimes echoed these sentiments, revealing that from the very beginning of his recruiting career, there was an implicit acceptance of bending the rules. “You have to do what you have to do to be successful,” his supervisor had encouraged, contributing to a cycle of dishonesty that seemed to normalize rule-breaking as a necessary means to an end.

While the Marine Corps maintains that fraud isn’t a widespread issue, it does seem to be more prevalent in areas facing the toughest recruiting challenges. Some current and former recruiters confirmed that they had not witnessed fraudulent practices, although they did acknowledge that those working under immense pressure sometimes succumbed to temptation.

Addressing the situation, a Marine Corps Recruiting Command spokesman stated that they have mechanisms in place to monitor and mitigate fraud. This includes conducting thorough quality control checks throughout the enlistment process and reviewing records rigorously when recruits arrive at boot camp. However, recruiters have indicated that while progress has been made since the pandemic—particularly in streamlining the waiver process and expanding recruiting hubs—the fundamental issue of pressure to meet quotas remains a significant concern.

The overarching theme reveals a systemic challenge within the Marine Corps recruitment framework, where the drive for high enlistment numbers often places ethical considerations in precarious balance. As recruiters continue to navigate this complex landscape, there is an ongoing debate about how best to meet recruitment goals without compromising integrity.",https://news.ssbcrack.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Marine-Recruiters-Resort-to-Fraud-Amidst-Intense-Quota-Pressures-in.jpeg,N,0.0,2026-01-05 14:56:37.003837

Other US Military Health Modernization Efforts

The navy’s at-sea pilot mirrors broader efforts across the armed forces to modernize healthcare delivery through digital systems.

In the army, field units have adopted the Medical Communications for Combat Casualty Care (MC4) system to give deployed medics access to patient records and medical logistics tools in austere environments.

MC4 supports battlefield documentation and helps commanders track medical readiness across formations during training and operations.

Meanwhile, the US Air Force has expanded the use of telehealth and remote monitoring platforms to support airmen at isolated bases and overseas locations.

The summit will be held on February 12 (rescheduled due to the fall’s government shutdown) at the Falls Church Marriott Fairview Park in Virginia, and brings together government health leaders and industry executives for in-depth discussions on modernization priorities shaping federal healthcare delivery. Registration is open and tickets are going fast — secure your place at this key GovCon conference today!

For government contractors supporting health IT, enterprise systems integration and digital transformation, the FEHRM fireside chat at the 2025 Healthcare Summit is expected to be one of the most consequential conversations on the agenda.

Why Should GovCons Pay Attention to FEHRM Now?

The Federal Electronic Health Record Modernization program has moved decisively beyond initial deployment and into a phase defined by optimization, interoperability and future capability delivery, with MHS GENESIS now fully deployed across the Military Health System.

With the common federal EHR in place, FEHRM’s focus has shifted toward enhancing performance, integrating user feedback and enabling advanced capabilities, including artificial intelligence, virtual care and data-driven clinical decision support. These efforts are central to how the Military Health System is rethinking care delivery, not only in hospitals and clinics, but also in deployed and contested environments.

For government contractors, this transition signals sustained demand for expertise in system optimization, analytics, cybersecurity, cloud infrastructure, AI enablement and legacy system retirement. As FEHRM works to ensure the EHR can support real-time data sharing from battlefield settings to stateside facilities and veteran care environments, industry partners will play a critical role in helping the platform scale, adapt and remain resilient.

The Healthcare Summit fireside chat offers GovCons a rare opportunity to hear directly from FEHRM leadership about how requirements are evolving now that MHS GENESIS is operational, and where industry support will be most impactful in the next phase of modernization.

Who Is Bill Tinston?

Bill Tinston serves as director of the Federal Electronic Health Record Modernization office, overseeing the implementation and continued evolution of a single, common federal EHR across multiple agencies.

Tinston brings more than 30 years of experience in defense acquisition, enterprise IT and portfolio management. He previously served as program executive officer for the Program Executive Office, Defense Healthcare Management Systems, where he led deployment of the Department of War’s EHR and worked closely with VA and the Coast Guard to align systems and workflows.

Before joining PEO DHMS, Tinston held senior executive roles at the Defense Logistics Agency, including program executive officer, where he oversaw major automated information systems and served as milestone decision authority for enterprise programs.

He holds a bachelor’s in business and information systems, is Defense Acquisition University Level III-certified in program management and information technology, and has received honors including the DLA Meritorious Civilian Service Award.

Tinston has consistently emphasized the importance of EHR systems that support clinical and operational decision-making without allowing IT constraints to dictate outcomes, a theme expected to feature prominently in the summit discussion.

Who Is Cori Hughes?

Cori Hughes serves as director of program integration for the Federal Electronic Health Record Modernization office and also holds the same role for the Program Executive Office, Defense Healthcare Management Systems.

In these positions, Hughes manages FEHRM’s cross-cutting integration efforts, including communications, government affairs, risk and issue management, integrated scheduling and performance optimization across federal stakeholders.

She also oversees public and government affairs activities for PEO DHMS, including congressional engagement, audit coordination and external communications related to EHR modernization.

Before joining FEHRM, Hughes supported senior leaders across the Department of War as a contractor, including within the Defense Health Agency and offices responsible for health affairs, acquisition and sustainment and personnel and readiness.

What Will the FEHRM Fireside Chat Cover?

At the 2025 Healthcare Summit, Tinston and Hughes’ fireside chat will explore how FEHRM leaders are building on the full deployment of MHS GENESIS to support a more connected, technology-enabled Military Health System.

Discussion topics are expected to include how the federal EHR is enabling virtual care, real-time consultation and advanced data sharing, including deployed and theater-specific use cases where specialists can support frontline medics remotely. The conversation will also address how FEHRM is preparing the EHR environment to support AI-driven tools, reduce administrative burden for providers and improve continuity of care as service members transition from active duty to veteran status.

As legacy systems are retired, FEHRM leaders are also expected to discuss the technical and operational challenges of maintaining an evergreen EHR platform, including cybersecurity considerations, performance in contested environments and integration with emerging technologies that support readiness and patient outcomes.

For attendees, the session will provide concrete insight into how FEHRM is translating deployment success into long-term capability growth, and what that means for contractors supporting health IT, data modernization and digital health innovation.

You’re living or are about to live in Salt Lake. A fucking huge city. Select all day.

It's been a while since I lived there, but I was a dependent back then. For the most part they would refer you if you needed any specialist. The only thing I've used since joining the Air Force is the pharmacy for my spouse or children while on leave. The pharmacy sucks every time I use it. It's about 45 minutes to activate a prescription and then 45 minutes for it to be ready. Either way, you can still use walgreens or any other pharmacy that takes Tricare and have a prescription ready quicker and, for dependents, you pay a tiny fraction of the cost. The only reason I use it there is because they're refills, not new prescriptions.

I'd say stick with prime and then only switch if getting into the PCM is too much of a hassle. You'd be fine there. I'm at Goodfellow right now and it makes no sense to be on select because your wait time to see a civilian doctor is ridiculously long. Maybe a month on base, but a new patient is 1 1/2 years right now and then 2-4 months for any referrals or anything like that.

Hubby works as a mechanic technician for the army. Unfortunately, his salary disqualifies him from Tricare so he is on a healthcare plan with SelectHealth through his job. It seems to take a decent amount out of his check and benefits are so/so.

I'm currently on my parents insurance but I turn 26 in a few months so I'll be kicked off at that point. I will also be finishing a limited term internship the same month as my birthday so I will (hopefully) be transitioning to a new job around that same time that will be full time and likely offer benefits.

As a military spouse should I just get on Tricare and not sign up for any healthcare plans through my employer? Are Tricare benefits and cost typically better than what I could be offered through other major healthcare insurance providers?

I also have to consider that hubby and I want to have kids within a couple years and I've heard that Tricare is really good for families including covering all delivery costs at the hospital etc. Also, I might have some employment gaps so I can stay at home once I start having kids.

There is also, of course, the option of getting added onto my husband's healthcare plan with SelectHealth. Not sure if that will somehow be cheaper or easier than me being on Tricare separate from him but obviously I want the best coverage I can get.
