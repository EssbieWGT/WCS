Winn director and Stewart-Hunter U.S. Army Medical Department commander Col. Margaret Berryman lauded Ochoa's critical role in ensuring that continuity of care, which, in turn, directly contributes to military readiness.
“Jim's leadership in EMS is paramount to our being a medically ready force and ensuring ready medical forces,"" Berryman said.
And now, as chief, I get to take care of my team, too.” Fittingly, the theme for Emergency Medical Services Week this year is “We Care.
For Everyone.” Be sure to thank your community’s paramedics and emergency medical technicians May 18-24 for their lifesaving care.","For the over 200,000 acres encompassing Fort Stewart-Hunter Army Airfield, Jim Ochoa is the calm in the storm, the steady hand guiding the critical first moments of a medical crisis. As chief of emergency medical services, Ochoa doesn't just manage a team; he orchestrates a lifeline, ensuring that when the unthinkable happens, a well-equipped and highly trained ambulance crew is ready to make every second count. His first responder colleagues also praise him for his role as a mentor, friend, leader, and community servant.

In his role as the EMS chief, Ochoa is responsible for the overall operation of the medical response assets on the military installation, ensuring the fleet of three ambulances are staffed with at least one paramedic each around the clock and ready to respond all day, every day, to any number of situations.

“We’re trained to provide care to a full range of patients—from infants to the elderly,” he said. “We handle emergencies in pediatrics, obstetrics, trauma, cardiac, and more. My responsibility is to make sure that when someone calls 911, a capable, well-equipped, and prepared ambulance crew responds promptly.

“In an emergency, seconds matter.”

Sometimes those emergencies include talking someone off of the edge, an event both medical services and police departments encounter almost daily. Law enforcement operations officer Maj. Richard Barrick, said the assistance Ochoa and team provide to police in instances like those is invaluable.

“If it were not for his dedication and training of his personnel we would not have such a success rate in getting people to the hospital to receive the proper care they require,” said the Department of the Army civilian police officer.

The hospital Ochoa and his team most often bring people needing care to is Fort Stewart’s military treatment facility, Winn Army Community Hospital. The hospital is working toward its re-designation as a level four trauma center and provides critical care for its beneficiaries, both inpatient and, when needed, sending patients to higher levels of care.

Winn director and Stewart-Hunter U.S. Army Medical Department commander Col. Margaret Berryman lauded Ochoa's critical role in ensuring that continuity of care, which, in turn, directly contributes to military readiness.

“Jim's leadership in EMS is paramount to our being a medically ready force and ensuring ready medical forces,"" Berryman said. ""His team's dedication ensures our Soldiers can focus on their mission, whether deployed or in the training area, knowing their families are in safe hands. Jim is a key part of the 'Winn'ing Team and keeps all of us ready and resilient.”

Being ready and resilient is second nature to Ochoa, an Army brat who joined the Army in 1988 as a combat medic and transitioned to being a paramedic on Fort Stewart in 1997. He has worked his way up through the ranks, from paramedic to supervisor, earning his wings as a flight paramedic and certification as a paramedic instructor, ultimately achieving his current role in 2016.

“As an Army medic, I was a senior line medic and knew every soldier in my platoon,” Ochoa said. “They weren’t just patients—they were friends, and I was committed to keeping them safe. That personal connection shaped how I approached the job.”

Working as a civilian paramedic changed the dynamic of that connection, Ochoa said.

“The people I care for are looking for someone who hears them and meets their needs,” he said.

Having all those levels of connection with the Army, from childhood, to military service, to civilian service, helped shape Ochoa’s perspective on how to relate with people.

“All of that built the foundation for my leadership today,” Ochoa said. “While I was hesitant to take the chief position at first—because I love patient care—I realized I could do more to help shape and evolve EMS on Fort Stewart.”

Shaping and evolving EMS here includes practicing for the worst day Stewart-Hunter could have. Together, EMS, police, and fire along with community partners rehearse responding to incidents. Fort Stewart assistant police chief Dorothea Mobley praised Ochoa for his team’s seamless integration by developing a shared understanding among first responders through his leadership, be it during an exercise or real-world incident.

“The success of coordinated operations like this illustrates that when law enforcement and EMS work in tandem—under visionary direction—the overall safety and well-being of the community are significantly enhanced” Mobley said. “Fort Stewart EMS is always mission-ready for large-scale emergencies and military-related exercises through a multifaceted approach that combines realistic scenario-based training, rigorous after-action reviews, and close interagency coordination.”

Setting the foundation for success in exercise and real-world incidents is another area Ochoa excel at said Fort Stewart police chief Bryan Lynch. Ochoa is the first to go through any task, exercise or real world, leading from the front. He is also a teacher, Lynch said, especially when it comes to teaching law enforcement to use its issued medical equipment.

“He is the first to sit down with all of our personnel to explain how and when to use it,” Lynch said.

While Ochoa may offer himself up first for training and incidents, it is his staff that comes first for him.

“They’re the ones doing the work, and my job is to make sure they have the tools, training, and resources they need to do it right” he said. That includes ensuring they’re equipped to respond to the wide variety of calls we receive—especially considering our responsibility covers 444 square miles of training area in addition to the cantonment zone.”

Being responsible for such a large area, including the more than 200,000 acres of training area making up Fort Stewart, presents several challenges, Ochoa said, including rough terrain and long distances. The major challenge, however, is time away from home, he said.

“Our crews work 24-hour shifts, similar to firefighters,” he said. “That can be tough, but we do build in enough time off to support life balance.”

Another challenge is the need to keep medical skills honed, ensuring paramedics are ready to any emergency, Ochoa said. The reward of keeping sharp is the outcomes.

“When our teams deliver the right care at the right time and it leads to a positive result, that’s what it’s all about,” Ochoa said. “I can say with extreme confidence that when my crews show up, they’re making the best decisions for those patients and getting them where they need to go safely.”

Getting patients to where they need to be is ultimately what matters, Ochoa said, not the recognition.

“I’d rather be behind the scenes,” he said. “When someone picks up the phone, I want them to know that someone will be there to take care of it. I don’t do this for the gratitude, although it often comes with the job. I do it because I love taking care of people. And now, as chief, I get to take care of my team, too.”

In this case, it means CPP is one step closer to potential approval for use in future combat trauma treatment.
In addition, having a wide selection of hemorrhage control products will help to fill the blood capability gap at distinct roles of care – providing more opportunities for lifesaving intervention.
“There is no one-size-fits-all approach to hemorrhage control or blood replacement therapies, especially in the critical moments after a catastrophic wound or injury,” said Mountney.","Blood loss due to battlefield wounds and injuries is a serious concern for U.S. Warfighters preparing for potential conflicts across the globe. The seconds, minutes, and hours after a casualty is wounded are critical to preventing combat trauma-related death.

U.S. casualty survival rates increased dramatically between WWII and Operations Enduring Freedom and Iraqi Freedom, in large part due to improved protection and treatment, better equipment and training, more robust medical logistics capabilities, and quicker medevac times. However, hemorrhage control and treatment – and the ability of medical providers at and near the front lines to arrange for casualty transportation to higher echelons of care – remain vitally important.

To answer these challenges, the Defense Health Agency is focused on preparing the U.S. Joint Force for the operations of today and the battlefields of tomorrow. DHA’s Operational Medical Systems team, based at Fort Detrick, Maryland, works with expert stakeholders across the Department of Defense, academia, and industry to develop solutions for America’s Warfighters, including hemorrhage control and blood replacement therapy programs to equip frontline providers with the lifesaving and life-prolonging treatments they require.

Managing severe bleeding in theater

“The OPMED blood program seeks to prevent deaths due to hemorrhage, the leading cause of preventable death on the battlefield,” said U.S. Army Lt. Col. Stephen Crimmins, a product manager with OPMED’s Warfighter Protection and Acute Care Project Management Office. “Cryopreserved platelets are one part of a larger blood program that also includes cold stored platelets and freeze-dried plasma.”

All three components of the program are critical in supporting hemorrhage control from the point of injury through the Role 3 level of trauma care, according to Crimmins. This broad-based development approach will give military medical providers more options for treatment – and provide refined control over blood product use and inventory management.

Platelet transfusions are essential in managing severe bleeding, but product shelf life and limited availability can pose logistical challenges in a far-forward environment. Cryopreserved platelets, or CPP, can be stored frozen for up to 5 years – providing a long-lasting alternative that can be deployed in both military and civilian healthcare settings.

Recently, OPMED’s commercial partner, Cellphire Therapeutics, Inc., received U.S. Food and Drug Administration “Fast Track” designation for its CPP treatment protocol, which is being developed for use when conventional platelets are not available or are in short supply. The designation, granted under the federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, is designed to expedite the development and review of drugs that address serious conditions and have the potential to fill an unmet medical need.

In this case, it means CPP is one step closer to potential approval for use in future combat trauma treatment.

“The Fast Track designation provides several benefits, including more frequent communication with the FDA, rolling review of completed sections of a submission, and eligibility for accelerated approval and priority review,” said Crimmins. “We feel that these benefits will help to quickly resolve problems as they come up and allow for an expedited review of the CPP submission – which could result in a faster delivery time of CPP to Warfighters.”

Expanding treatment options

A common issue with combat trauma hemorrhaging is coagulopathy, or the inability of blood to form clots, sometimes caused by platelet deficiency due to blood loss. During combat trauma treatment, medical providers can transfuse platelets to help stabilize patients – but traditional platelet treatments may be in short supply or impractical to administer at and near the front lines. Having an alternative, like the cryopreserved platelets that are currently in development, may give future providers another treatment option to decrease the likelihood of mortality in wounded service members.

In addition, having a wide selection of hemorrhage control products will help to fill the blood capability gap at distinct roles of care – providing more opportunities for lifesaving intervention. This combined approach with conventional platelets, cryopreserved platelets, and other blood replacement therapies will aid in improving survivability and reducing the impact of logistical lines crossing hundreds or thousands of miles, according to U.S. Army Lt. Col. Andrea Mountney, WPAC’s deputy program manager.

“There is no one-size-fits-all approach to hemorrhage control or blood replacement therapies, especially in the critical moments after a catastrophic wound or injury,” said Mountney. “In resource-limited environments and potential conflict areas with contested and congested logistics, it is imperative to have a multi-tiered approach for blood replacement therapies.”

Because of the large geographic distances in places like the Indo-Pacific – which comprises roughly 52% of the Earth’s surface – medevac capabilities for frontline providers may be more limited than during previous conflicts. The evolving nature of U.S. defense strategy places a premium on light logistical footprints, small-unit independence, and mission-specific force structures to maximize lethality while increasing maneuverability in littoral regions.

Developing lifesaving and life-prolonging blood products will go a long way toward meeting the mission needs of combatant commanders preparing for future large-scale combat operations in austere environments across the globe, according to Mountney.

“The cryopreserved platelets we are developing help to directly equip frontline medics, corpsmen, and health care providers with another tool to prolong life while awaiting medevac and mitigate the effects of severe bleeding when traditional options are exhausted,” she said. “Blood and blood products continue to be one of the most valuable resources in combat medicine – it is critical to have as many treatment options as possible.”

Lazanda, a fentanyl nasal spray, is approved by the FDA solely for break-through cancer pain in patients who are already receiving and who are tolerant to opioid therapy for their underlying persistent cancer pain. The United States alleges that, between 2013 and 2017, Assertio, which was known as Depomed at the time, caused the submission of false claims to the Medicare and TRICARE programs by focusing its marketing on pain specialists who were prescribing high volumes of TIRF products, including those who were flagged for diversion or who were later indicted. The United States further alleges that Assertio placed high-volume TIRF prescribers on its speakers’ bureau and advisory boards and developed its “Signature Support Program” to ensure that Lazanda prescriptions would be approved by insurance companies, including Medicare Part D plans. The United States contends that Assertio’s marketing efforts caused prescribers to write Lazanda prescriptions for Medicare and TRICARE beneficiaries who did not have breakthrough cancer pain, resulting in the submission of false claims to Medicare and TRICARE from thirteen high-volume prescribers.

“This company took steps to boost its profits despite the risk of boosting the deadly opioid epidemic, said U.S. Attorney Edward R. Martin Jr. for the District of Columbia. “Our office will continue to seek out violations like this that demonstrate a brazen disregard for the safety of the public.”

“At a time when communities across the country are still dealing with the devasting impact of the opioid epidemic, pharmaceutical companies have a responsibility to uphold the highest standards of integrity,” said Acting Assistant Director Darren Cox of the FBI’s Criminal Investigative Division. “This settlement reflects the FBI’s unwavering commitment to protecting public health and holding those accountable who fuel addiction and defraud federal healthcare programs through deceptive marketing of powerful drugs like fentanyl.”

“Violations of the False Claims Act such as the illegal prescribing practices alleged in this settlement are especially egregious considering the opioid epidemic,” said Deputy Inspector General Christian J. Schrank of the Department of Health and Human Services Office of Inspector General (HHS-OIG). “HHS-OIG will continue to work with our law enforcement partners to ensure health care providers and corporations involved in schemes that threaten patient safety are held accountable.”

The civil settlement includes the resolution of claims under the qui tam, or whistleblower, provisions of the FCA by Noelle Webb and Nicole Novellino, who previously worked at Assertio as sales representatives. The FCA authorizes private parties to sue on behalf of the United States for false claims and share in any recovery. The qui tam case is captioned United States ex rel. Webb et al. v.

(NASDAQ: ZYXI) is facing a double whammy linked to its dealings with TriCare, the healthcare program for the U.S. military community. The company's first-quarter 2025 results revealed a sharp downturn, largely attributed to a temporary payment suspension by one of its major payers, TriCare.

Adding to the company’s troubles, this very TriCare payment issue has now become central to a recently announced class action lawsuit filed on behalf of Zynex investors. The lawsuit, Tuncel v. Zynex, Inc., No. 25-cv-00913 (D. Colo.), alleges that Zynex and certain top executives violated federal securities laws between March 13, 2023, and March 11, 2025.

Disappointing Q1 2025 Results Due to TriCare Suspension

On April 29, 2025, Zynex reported that its net revenue for the first quarter of 2025 plummeted to $26.6 million, a significant drop from the $46.5 million reported in the same period of 2024. The company also experienced a contraction in gross profit margin, falling to 69% in Q1 2025, compared to 80% in the prior year. The bottom line reflected these challenges, with an adjusted EBITDA loss of $11.8 million, a stark contrast to the $1.7 million in adjusted EBITDA recorded in the first quarter of 2024.

On the earnings call, Zynex CEO Thomas Sandgaard directly cited the TriCare payment suspension as a primary driver of the disappointing first-quarter results. He stated that the disruption significantly impacted revenue calculations and prompted the company to initiate a restructuring to prepare for a scenario where TriCare payments remain halted.

Looking ahead, Zynex has offered a muted revenue guidance of $27 million for the second quarter of 2025, with an anticipated EPS loss of $0.20. The company has withheld full-year guidance pending clarity on the TriCare situation, a decision that reflects the significant uncertainty surrounding this key payer relationship.

Analysts on the earnings call voiced concerns that the TriCare situation could create a domino effect, prompting other insurers to re-evaluate their reimbursement policies for Zynex's device.

Zynex Securities Class Action Alleges ""Oversupplying"" Scheme

The payment woes with Tricare appear to be intertwined with more serious allegations leveled against Zynex in a newly filed securities class action.

The core of the lawsuit’s allegations mirrors the explanation provided by Zynex for its poor financial performance. Investors claim that the company misled them by failing to disclose practices that ultimately led to the TriCare payment suspension. Specifically, the lawsuit contends that Zynex shipped excessive amounts of products, including electrodes, inflating revenue and drawing scrutiny from insurers like TriCare. The plaintiffs argue that the company should have warned investors about the likely adverse consequences of these practices, including the potential for payment suspensions and removal from insurer networks.

The complaint highlights a more than 5% drop in Zynex's share price following a June 4, 2024 report by STAT detailing an alleged ""oversupplying scheme."" This report, according to the lawsuit, raised concerns about the company's billing practices and likely contributed to the increased scrutiny from payers like TriCare.

The lawsuit further points to a dramatic over 51% plunge in Zynex's share price on March 11, 2025, the day the company reported its disappointing fourth-quarter 2024 results and disclosed the significant TriCare payment suspension.

Hagens Berman’s Investigation

Shareholder rights firm Hagens Berman is investigating the alleged claims. “The significant revenue decline and the revised guidance following the TriCare payment suspension raise serious questions about the accuracy and timeliness of Zynex's prior statements to investors. We are investigating whether the company adequately disclosed the risks associated with its billing practices and its reliance on TriCare revenues,” said Reed Kathrein, the Hagens Berman Partner leading the firm’s probe.

“The Defense Health Network Central is the largest network in the Military Health System,” said Harrell during senior leader mission overviews about DHN Central, WHASC, BAMC, and the 59th MDW, all located at Joint Base San Antonio.
“And here in San Antonio, you are doing more force generation than anywhere else.
After the visit, Harrell expressed his appreciation for Ferrara’s visit to Joint Base San Antonio.
""We were honored to host Dr. Ferrara and showcase the unique capabilities of the San Antonio Military Health System, along with our steadfast commitment to delivering world-class health care to our nation’s warfighters and their families,” said Harrell.","The Military Health System’s top leader got a firsthand look at the unrivaled medical capabilities offered by the San Antonio military healthcare system during a special visit to Joint Base San Antonio, Texas, on April 18.

Dr. Stephen Ferrara, appointed in January 2025 as the acting assistant secretary of defense for health affairs, visited San Antonio military hospitals and training campuses to gain further insights into the complex structure of the area’s medical system and staff.

“These visits are so valuable to learn about what you do and to meet the people doing the work. It gives me a keener understanding of how things are going,” Ferrara said during opening remarks with medical leadership.

Hosted by U.S. Air Force Maj. Gen. Thomas Harrell, director of the Defense Health Agency’s Defense Health Network Central, the fast-paced visit included walking tours of Wilford Hall Ambulatory Surgical Center’s emergency department, and Brooke Army Medical Center’s emergency department, which is part of the only Level 1 trauma center in the Department of Defense. During the visit, staff explained how the partnership between the 59th Medical Wing and BAMC enables the support of 2.5 million patient visits each year.

Ferrara also toured the Medical Education and Training Campus surgical technologist and hospital corpsman basic courses, the U.S. Army Medical Center of Excellence, U.S. Army Institute of Surgical Research Burn Center, and the Center for the Intrepid.

While at METC, Ferrara visited the nursing synthesis lab, Tactical Combat Casualty Care and Shipboard Mass Casualty labs, which are curricula in the Navy Hospital Corpsman Basic course. He also observed a mock surgery and participated in a laparoscopy procedure—a method for doing surgery using a thin, lighted tube with a camera—part of METC’s Surgical Technologist course.

“It’s been a great day seeing where our young enlisted come in and learn these critical medical skills,” Ferrara said, referring to his visit to METC. “This is readiness right here.”

Throughout the visit, Ferrara talked with staff and asked questions about their operations, resources, and challenges they encounter in supporting the high volume and complexity of patient care across the San Antonio military healthcare system.

“The Defense Health Network Central is the largest network in the Military Health System,” said Harrell during senior leader mission overviews about DHN Central, WHASC, BAMC, and the 59th MDW, all located at Joint Base San Antonio. “Everything goes back to sustaining and creating lethality of the force. It’s all about generating medics to support the mission.”

In addition to the walking tours, Ferrara had an opportunity to discuss his priorities for the MHS and speak with medical staff during two town halls at Wilford Hall and BAMC.

“I love to get out to do these visits to see where the work is done because that’s what informs the decision making, in my opinion. First and foremost, I want to thank you for the work you do taking care of patients, being your very best and training the next generation,” Ferrara said during the town hall at WHASC.

In his role as the acting ASD-HA, Ferrara said he can actively advocate for the needs of the MHS.

“I’m the liaison between the MHS, the secretary, and the White House. I’m your voice and that’s key. When I come here and see that texture and learn those anecdotes, I can talk about real-world things. I learned a lot here this morning at Wilford Hall about the amazing work and volume of patients you see in the emergency room, the large volume of calls your EMS team does, the [number] of people you are training—and you are also training the next generation. One of my immediate priorities is to ensure you have the things you need.”

In his advocacy role, Ferrara said his priorities for the MHS are to support the warfighter, sustain our skills, and strengthen our chain, which he explained is the continuity of trained healthcare professionals that can’t be broken because they take the baton as part of our force-generation platform.

“One of my jobs, which I feel has been effective so far in these first 90 to 100 days, is showing how we affect lethality by keeping guns in the fight. When people think of a weapons system they might think of a hypersonic weapon or a fighter aircraft–but for us, the human is the weapons system—the airman, soldier, sailor, Marine, or Guardian. By us keeping them healthy and by generating a medically ready force, we are empowering the warfighter to go and do what they need to do.”

After taking in the facility tours and talking with medical staff, Ferrara summed up his perspective about the unique and integrated readiness capabilities within the San Antonio military healthcare system.

“San Antonio is really the center of gravity in the MHS for sustaining our skills,” Ferrara concluded during the town hall at BAMC. “It’s the place where you have the highest patient count—seeing more emergency room visits than most. And BAMC has the only Level 1 trauma center in the MHS—that’s how you sustain your skills, doing those high-volume, high-complexity cases.

“And here in San Antonio, you are doing more force generation than anywhere else. You are paying forward to make sure you train someone well to come in, and that’s hugely important. Those are the priorities,” he said.

After the visit, Harrell expressed his appreciation for Ferrara’s visit to Joint Base San Antonio.

""We were honored to host Dr. Ferrara and showcase the unique capabilities of the San Antonio Military Health System, along with our steadfast commitment to delivering world-class health care to our nation’s warfighters and their families,” said Harrell. “As the largest force-generating platform—home to the DOD’s sole Level 1 trauma center and burn center—this system plays a vital role in sustaining the health, wellness, and operational readiness of our force.”",https://d1ldvf68ux039x.cloudfront.net/thumbs/photos/2504/8987229/1000w_q95.jpg,N,1.0,2025-05-09 11:56:28.867483

If you’re thinking about joining the military, it’s natural to have questions—especially if you’ve experienced mental health challenges in the past. One of the most common concerns among potential recruits is: does the military check your mental health records? The answer is nuanced, and it depends on several factors including the branch you’re applying to, the severity of your history, and how recent the diagnosis or treatment was.

The military takes both mental and physical fitness seriously, not to exclude people unnecessarily, but to ensure that every service member can handle the intense pressures of duty. Understanding how the process works can help reduce anxiety and ensure you’re prepared for what comes next.

That’s where our guide from the expert team at TriCareRehabs will become an essential asset, so keep reading to learn all you need to know about mental health records and the military.

Does the Military Look at Mental Health Records During Recruitment?

Yes, the military does review your medical records and mental health history as part of the enlistment process. This review helps determine if you’re fit for service under Department of Defense medical standards.

When you apply to enlist, you’ll complete a detailed medical history questionnaire. This medical screening will include questions about past mental health diagnoses, counseling, medications, hospitalizations, or any other behavioral health-related concerns.

Being honest about your medical information on this form is crucial. If you’ve had a diagnosis of depression, anxiety, PTSD, ADHD, or other conditions, you’ll likely be asked for documentation or further evaluation.

The military doesn’t automatically disqualify from the recruitment process if they have a mental health history. However, they do evaluate the circumstances carefully to ensure your safety and the safety of those you serve.

How Does the Military Access Your Records?

The military does not have automatic access to your private medical or psychiatric records without your consent. However, when you sign your enlistment paperwork, you authorize the Department of Defense and Military Entrance Processing Station (MEPS) to request records if something in your history flags the need for additional review.

This means they may reach out to doctors, therapists, or hospitals you’ve seen if it relates to a declared condition or red flag in your application. If you try to withhold information and it’s later discovered, it can lead to disqualification, delayed enlistment, or even discharge after entry. Full transparency is not only ethical but often in your best interest, especially if your condition is treatable or considered resolved.

What Mental Health Conditions Can Affect Military Eligibility?

Some mental health issues are considered disqualifying for military service, particularly if they are recent, untreated, or interfere with functioning. These may include:

Schizophrenia or other psychotic disorders

Bipolar disorder

Severe depression with suicidal ideation or attempts

Anxiety or panic disorders that impair functioning

Substance use disorders within the past year

PTSD or trauma-related disorders, particularly if recently diagnosed

However, conditions like mild depression or anxiety, especially if resolved without long-term medication, may not be disqualifying. If you’ve been off medication for a significant period, completed therapy successfully, or your symptoms have not recurred, you may still be eligible.

In many cases, a waiver can be requested, and the final decision is made by military medical professionals who consider the totality of your health, recovery, and current functioning.

Can You Still Join the Military If You’ve Seen a Therapist?

Yes, seeing a therapist does not automatically bar you from military service. In fact, seeking help when needed shows maturity and responsibility. What matters more is the reason for the therapy, the diagnosis (if any), the outcome, and whether any symptoms remain. Routine counseling for stress, grief, family issues, or non-clinical concerns is generally not disqualifying.

If you’ve seen a therapist but were never diagnosed with a serious mental illness, and your care was short-term or preventative, it likely won’t impact your application. Again, honesty is key. If you’re unsure how your mental or physical health history might be interpreted, talking with a recruiter or a medical liaison at MEPS can help you prepare.

How to Handle Mental Health Disclosures During Military Enlistment

Navigating the mental health portion of the enlistment process can feel stressful, but the right approach makes a big difference. First, gather accurate information about your history. This includes diagnoses, treatment timelines, medications, and discharge notes if you were ever hospitalized. Second, talk to your providers.

Ask if they can write a summary of your treatment and outcomes, especially if your care is complete and you are now stable. Third, be upfront with your recruiter. They’re used to seeing a wide range of histories and can often tell you if a waiver might be possible.

Trying to hide or minimize your past can raise red flags that delay or even block your application. Transparency shows integrity—something the military values highly.

What Is a Mental Health Waiver and How Do You Get One?

If a condition you disclose is technically disqualifying, your recruiter may recommend applying for a mental health waiver. A waiver for military health records is a formal request for the military to reconsider your eligibility based on additional evidence of stability, recovery, or low risk of recurrence.

To support a waiver, you may need letters from mental health providers, records showing completion of treatment, or even undergo an independent evaluation.

The process can take time, and not all medical waivers are granted, but many people with a documented history of improvement successfully join with a waiver. Each branch—Army, Navy, Air Force, Marines, and Coast Guard—has its own guidelines, but all follow Department of Defense medical standards as a baseline.

Will Your Mental Health Be Evaluated Again After Enlistment?

Yes, mental wellness is a key part of readiness, and mental health assessments don’t end after you join. The military offers support for service members throughout their careers, including access to behavioral health professionals, confidential counseling, and crisis intervention services through the Department of Veterans Affairs and other military organizations.

It’s also common to undergo mental health checks as part of deployment preparation or after experiencing trauma. If you’re already enlisted and begin to struggle with mental health, seeking support is not a sign of weakness—it’s a sign of strength. The culture around mental health in the military is changing, with growing efforts to reduce stigma and encourage treatment without punishment or judgment.

How to Prepare Mentally and Emotionally for Military Life

Military service is demanding—physically, mentally, and emotionally. Preparing yourself in all three areas increases your chance of success and satisfaction. Here are some steps you can take:

Build resilience through regular exercise, healthy sleep, and stress-reduction techniques like mindfulness or journaling

Address unresolved mental health concerns before enlistment to show you’re proactive about your well-being

Talk with others who’ve served to understand the emotional demands of training, deployment, and reintegration

Stay connected to supportive friends, family, or a therapist who can help you navigate challenges as they arise

The military values individuals who are self-aware, adaptable, and emotionally strong—not perfect. Demonstrating that you’ve done the work to get and stay healthy can be a powerful asset in your application and beyond.

What to Do If You’re Denied Entry Because of Mental Health

If you’re denied entry due to your mental health history, it’s not the end of the road. You may be able to:

Appeal the decision with new documentation or provider testimony.

Apply for a waiver if one wasn’t initially offered.

Wait a period of time, continue treatment, and reapply when you can show longer-term stability.

Consider other paths to serve your country such as the National Guard, ROTC programs, or civilian roles within the defense and security sectors.

Most importantly, continue taking care of your mental health. Rejection doesn’t define your worth or potential—it’s simply one step in a much larger journey. There are many ways to serve, and the most valuable thing you can offer the world is your health and wholeness.

Can You Join the Military With a History of Inpatient Mental Health Treatment?

Inpatient treatment does raise additional scrutiny, but it doesn’t always mean disqualification. The key questions the military will ask include:

How long ago was the hospitalization?

What condition was treated?

Were there any self-harm or suicide-related events?

Have you completed treatment and remained stable without relapse?

If it’s been several years since your inpatient stay and you’ve functioned well since then—holding a job, completing school, or maintaining strong relationships—there’s a possibility for waiver consideration. Documentation from your treatment team can be critical in showing how far you’ve come. Don’t let a difficult chapter in your past stop you from exploring your future.

Is It Worth Pursuing a Military Career If You Have a Mental Health History?

Only you can answer that, but the truth is that many people with prior mental health concerns go on to serve with distinction. The military isn’t looking for perfection—they’re looking for people who are capable, resilient, and mission-ready.

If you’ve worked hard on your mental wellness, if you understand your limits and your strengths, and if you want to serve for the right reasons, then yes—it can absolutely be worth it.

Use this journey as a chance to advocate for yourself, build discipline, and show how your past has shaped you into a strong and self-aware person. Those are the kinds of people who make an impact, whether in uniform or out.

What You Should Know Before Enlisting

Mental health history doesn’t define your future, but it does shape how you’ll be evaluated during the military enlistment process. Be honest, be prepared, and be proactive. If you’re currently receiving care, that’s not a weakness—it’s a sign that you take your well-being seriously. Work with your providers, gather your records, and talk openly with your recruiter.

Every branch of the military wants capable individuals who can thrive under pressure, and that includes those who’ve overcome adversity. If you’re committed to your growth and willing to walk through the process with integrity, your past doesn’t have to limit your future. Whether you wear the uniform or find another way to serve, your mental health journey is a strength—not a setback.

So the hospital sent me to collections for the difference, even though the claim had been paid.
I’ve been told to wait 120 days by one person and 10 days by another.","I’m posting this because I genuinely don’t know if I’m losing it or just getting run through the wringer by a broken system. I got out of the Navy on October 1st and switched from TRICARE Prime to TRICARE Select like I was supposed to. No gaps, nothing weird. I thought everything was squared away.

A short time later, I was diagnosed with Type 3 Achalasia at the University of Washington Medical Center in Montlake. The doctors said it was severe and that surgery was absolutely necessary. So I went through with it in early November.

A few days after I got out of the hospital, I crashed. Couldn’t stand. Couldn’t function. I was readmitted in bad shape. I called TRICARE West before and after that hospital stay to keep them informed.

That’s where everything started to fall apart.

TRICARE denied the claim. They said they needed a police report, which made no sense because there was no accident. They also wanted a DD form. I sent it by certified mail and fax, got confirmation they received it, but they still denied the claim. After a bunch of follow-up calls, someone finally admitted they had it and approved the payment.

Problem is, they had already sent a denial letter to the hospital, which caused the hospital to think I never did what I was supposed to. So the hospital sent me to collections for the difference, even though the claim had been paid. I got no notice this was happening. They just sent me to collections out of nowhere. We're talking about over a dozen line items, some for ten bucks, some for thousands.

To make things even more confusing, when I mentioned this to a TRICARE rep back when I thought it might happen, she told me I was not allowed to pay it. She said it was against TRICARE rules and could even cause me to lose coverage. She told me that if I got threatened with collections, to call them and they’d handle it. But there was no warning. It just happened.

Since then I’ve spent hours on the phone with TRICARE. I’ve had to tell the same story over and over. I’ve been transferred to the wrong numbers. I’ve been hung up on. I’ve been told to wait 120 days by one person and 10 days by another. I’ve been promised callbacks that never came. One time they told me a supervisor was trying to call me and it was going to voicemail. I had no missed calls. Nothing.

They got me to hang up under the idea that I’d be getting that call. It never came. And this cycle has repeated more times than I can count.

I am not doing well. I’m mentally and emotionally wrecked at this point. And the worst part is, I’m in the middle of a clearance reinvestigation. If these collections stick, they could cost me my clearance. If you live in Kitsap County, you know what that means. No clearance means no job. No career. No future in this line of work.

I don’t even know if I actually owe this money. I followed every instruction. I kept my insurance informed. I got a medically necessary surgery. And now I feel like I’m the one getting punished for doing the right thing.

Is this normal? Do I owe this money? Is this just how the system works? Has anyone else been through this and figured out how to make it stop? Because right now I genuinely feel like I’m about to break.

“USAMRIID is my first research assignment, which operates differently from my other duty assignments, not just in security, but in practical science.
Although her work currently focuses on virology, her educational background in chemistry occasionally proves helpful when her team conducts studies.","FORT DETRICK, Md. – In the future, biodefense will rely in part on military medicine assets from the Defense Health Agency Research & Development-Medical Research and Development Command to protect Warfighters from current and future threats. Some of those assets are people such as Ashely Piper, the command’s first Employee of the Quarter for 2025, who dedicates herself to advancing emerging research.

As a research microbiologist at the U.S. Army Medical Research Institute of Infectious Diseases’ Viral Pathogenesis Branch, Piper is part of a nearly 60-year history of the institute detecting and defending against current and emerging biological threats. The research that Piper conducts for the institute helps make DHA R&D-MRDC a leader in global health security and in regions where Warfighters are often deployed.

“Ms. Piper’s exceptional technical and leadership skills were keys to the successful planning and execution of pivotal animal model studies in support of the Institute of Infectious Diseases' mission of developing medical countermeasures against emerging biothreat agents,” said Maj. Gen. Paula Lodi, commanding general of DHA R&D-MRDC.

Piper has been fortunate to call the institute her home and career for nearly two decades. Early in her journey, tenured researchers helped her to develop a deep understanding of infectious disease research focused on the Warfighter. But as long as Piper has been at USAMRIID, she feels in a literal sense, she is training the next generation of scientists.

Some of the junior enlisted Soldiers she trains may have hospital or lab experience, but often lack experience operating in a biosafety level environment. Piper addresses this by beginning their training in lower-level labs, and once they are ready, she transitions them to BSL-3 or BSL-4 labs to provide them with more in-depth virology experience.

As she leads the virology division’s animal studies, she teaches junior enlisted one of the most established and reliable methods in virology: plaque assays, a measure of adding virus particles to permissive cells and applying a semisolid overlay that limits the spread of infection to neighboring cells, thus causing cell death leading to the formation of plaques. Plaque assays are a skillset that Sgt. Adam Crawford, a medical laboratory technician at the institute’s Viral Pathogenesis Branch, says is one of things that he and other Soldiers commonly agree what makes Piper, in his words, “simply awesome” in her mentorship.

“USAMRIID is my first research assignment, which operates differently from my other duty assignments, not just in security, but in practical science. I had never grown cells or produced plates of plaques to count. Ashley helped me learn what works best for me as she is a subject matter expert who I can rely on no matter what virus or procedure we are working on,” said Crawford.

Aspects of chemistry and biology have interested Piper since she was a teenager. Although her work currently focuses on virology, her educational background in chemistry occasionally proves helpful when her team conducts studies. Today, some of the medical countermeasures that Piper is studying includes pathogenic responses to different diseases like Chikungunya, a common mosquito-related virus in tropical and subtropical regions where U.S. military assets are present, and developing treatments for approval by the Food and Drug Administration.

After the initial 1976 Ebola outbreak, the DOD responded with a whole-of-government approach, developing vaccines and diagnostic tools for patient care. As the virus reemerged over the years, Piper became one of the institute’s subject matter experts studying an Ebola viral response, and so much so, in 2014 she traveled from Fort Detrick, Maryland to Fort Campbell, Kentucky to train Soldiers deploying to a region in Africa with a current outbreak, helping them defend themselves against the threat.

“Being a part of the response team those two weeks at Fort Campbell was one of the most memorable parts of my career,” said Piper. “It was a rewarding feeling to know that I had a direct impact in training our military personnel during the Ebola outbreak in 2014.”",https://d1ldvf68ux039x.cloudfront.net/thumbs/photos/2505/9024159/1000w_q95.jpg,N,0.0,2025-05-09 00:56:31.595750

I am proud to be a part of this team and to contribute to the development of the next generation of Army nurse leaders.","Tripler Army Medical Center, Hawaii — A group of six U.S. Army nurses took the stage in Tripler Army Medical Center’s Kyser Auditorium on April 25, celebrating their completion of the hospital’s Clinical Nurse Transition Program.

Across the Military Health System, hospitals and clinics depend on highly skilled, well-trained nurses to provide high-quality patient care to active duty service members, veterans, and their families. Tripler’s CNTP is one of the programs that trains these nurses.

""These are new grads who have never worked as a registered nurse and are coming to us from the Basic Officer Leadership Course,” said Tina McNeal, director of TAMC’s CNTP program. “It's our job to show they are competent and confident nurses. With guidance from qualified preceptors, we provide a safe and supportive environment for nurses and patients, prioritizing patient safety and nurse development.""

The CNTP, which falls under Tripler’s Directorate of Health and Education Training, is an accelerated program designed to cultivate new Army nurses by transitioning them from academics to clinical practice while also developing the leadership skills and competencies necessary to excel as an Army officer.

New nurses begin the program with a 45-day orientation and onboarding phase. The next 12 weeks of CNTP are dedicated to one-to-one precepted time. Each new nurse is paired with an experienced and qualified preceptor, and the precepted time is tailored to each nurse's needs. Experienced preceptors provide individualized guidance and feedback.

""The program is individualized to the nurses,” McNeal said. “Some of the nurses come in with experience or enlistee experience. Some of the nurses might progress quicker than 12 weeks. There's an evaluation tool that preceptors use to track progress against benchmarks. Our program isn't prescriptive. If a nurse isn't meeting benchmarks, that's okay. We create a plan that supports nurses who need extra time.""

One of the successes of TAMC's CNTP program was revamping their evidence-based practice requirement, condensing it from six months to a two-day workshop at the end of precepted time. This change allowed nurses to collaborate, develop projects, and present to leaders, resulting in a more engaging and practical experience. The success of this approach led to its adoption as a recommended model for all CNTP sites, demonstrating the impact of TAMC’s innovative solution.

""They are standing up in their dress uniforms in front of the Chief Nursing Officer, Deputy Commander of Surgical Services, and other deputy lane section chiefs, and presenting a professional presentation.” McNeal said. “That's a huge success.”

One of the elements that sets TAMC's program apart is a sponsorship program, connecting participants with clinical learning, personalized support, and communication that begins before participants even arrive in Hawaii. This proactive approach helps new nurses navigate the unique challenges of military life, ensuring a smooth transition and reducing anxiety about the unknowns of Army culture, protocols, and expectations.

“We provide personalized support 30-plus days before arrival, including airport pickup, hotel accommodations, and resource coordination,” said Maj. Daniel J. Hines, assistant director of the program. ""Our goal is to immerse them in Tripler's culture and Army life, ensuring a smooth onboarding, which often includes relocation, deployment, benefits, and managing money.""

The program intentionally fosters community and teamwork among new Army nurses, recognizing that isolation can be challenging. By encouraging volunteer work, social events, and team-building activities, such as participating in marathons and celebrating the Army Nurse Corps Birthday, nurses develop essential networking skills and learn to rely on each other.

Program participants also devote a significant amount of time to volunteer work. The recent cohort volunteered more than 200 hours in the past eight months, with many members pursuing the Military Outstanding Volunteer Service Medal. The cohort earned first place in this year’s TAMC Safety Video campaign, lead unit physical trainings, and were key participants in the Army Nurse Corps Birthday celebration. This group participated in Initial Combat Training and Leader Development, which help increase the overall numbers for the Combat Medical Specialist role within the Army.

The cohort also participates in volunteer work supporting the greater Oahu community. Teams provided medical support for the last three Honolulu Marathons. They also participated in a project to restore the ecosystem of Honolulu’s Ala Wai Canal, creating nearly 1,000 Genki Balls — mud balls filled with microorganisms that digest sludge and act as a “probiotic” for the environment.

“We are putting them in situations where they must lean on each other,” Hines said. “This approach helps to identify emerging leaders and creates a cohesive unit that can work together seamlessly, even in high-pressure situations like a code on the floor.”

The program’s success is a testament to the dedication and passion of its leaders. “With her unwavering commitment to excellence, she has maintained an elevated standard, even in the face of changing military landscapes,” Hines said, “Her tireless efforts have created a program that not only produces exceptional nurses but also fosters a sense of community and camaraderie among its participants.”

Having personally experienced the struggles of transitioning into clinical practice as a new nurse, McNeal knows firsthand the challenges that can come with being thrown into a high-stakes environment without adequate support. Her own difficult transition, which nearly led her to leave the profession, has fueled her passion for creating a better experience for others.

McNeal has dedicated herself to developing a comprehensive and supportive program that sets them up for success, rather than leaving them to navigate the complexities of clinical practice alone. “I do love it, so it makes it easy,” McNeal said. “I do love the job! I am proud to be a part of this team and to contribute to the development of the next generation of Army nurse leaders. That’s why I love it.”",https://dha.mil/-/media/Project/Images/News-Images/9021860.jpg,N,0.0,2025-05-09 04:56:18.715275

“You knew what you were signing up for.” Ah, yes.
From the comment section on a military spouse support thread.
You can know military life comes with hard seasons and still feel wrecked by them.
So the next time someone says, “Well, you knew what you were signing up for,” feel free to smile sweetly and reply: “Sure did.","But just because you knew doesn’t make it any easier. Being prepared doesn’t cancel out the hard parts.

There’s a phrase that gets tossed at military spouses like a passive-aggressive grenade—smiling on the outside, condescending on the inside.

“You knew what you were signing up for.”

Ah, yes. The Greatest Hits of Things No One Asked You to Say, Vol. 1.

You’ll hear it everywhere. From a well-meaning aunt who’s never moved out of her hometown. From the comment section on a military spouse support thread. From the spouse of someone in another branch implying that their lifestyle is harder. (Congratulations on your suffering, Janet.)

And maybe, on your lowest days, you’ve even said it to yourself. Quietly, like a warning: “You knew what you signed up for. Get it together.”

Except. No.

Yes, you did “sign up” when you said yes to getting married. Sure, you probably knew that the job came with spontaneous goodbyes, weird hours, relocations, Tricare. And maybe there was the briefest awareness that once you said, “I do,” you’d never (ever) think about civilian life the same.

You knew.

But did you know what it would feel like to explain to your kid why Mom or Dad missed their birthday again? To forever use pencil on a calendar and not pen because you know all plans will eventually change, no matter what?

Did you know what it would do to your nervous system to live in a constant state of “maybe”? Did you know you’d become a one-woman or one-man logistics team, therapist, and spiritual advisor every time a deployment cycle started?

Let’s be clear: knowing doesn’t make it easier. Knowing just means you’re bracing for impact. You still have to survive it. Thrive through it, even. And here you are, one cup of coffee, one Command hook, one unhinged PCS binder at a time.

Myth #1: You knew, so you can’t complain

Look, we all read the fine print, or at least skimmed it. We knew what we were stepping into. But knowing the stove is hot doesn’t mean you enjoy burning your hand on it every two years.

You can know military life comes with hard seasons and still feel wrecked by them. You can anticipate a goodbye and still fall apart at the gate. You can mentally prepare for being the solo parent, the house fixer, the emotional anchor and still want to scream into a void when your partner’s deployment gets extended again with zero notice. When they get stuck at the office (again). When you can’t plan a date night because you have no idea if their chain is going to keep them (again).

This life demands a lot of you. And you’re allowed to be honest about that. Anyone who says otherwise should be gently escorted off your metaphorical porch.

Myth #2: Other people have had it worse

This one shows up in sneakier ways. You hear about someone whose spouse is deployed longer, whose housing situation is worse, whose kids are struggling harder. And suddenly you feel selfish for feeling anything at all.

But listen. Pain is not a competitive sport.

You don’t need to earn your right to struggle. You don’t need to hit a certain threshold of hardship before you’re allowed to say, “Hey, this really sucks.”

Your hard is hard. That’s enough. Comparison doesn’t heal anything. It just keeps us all pretending we’re fine when we’re absolutely not.

Myth #3: Grace is only for civilians

There’s this unspoken idea (sometimes whispered, sometimes shouted) that military spouses have to be tougher than the rest of the world. That grace, gentleness, softness… those are luxuries for people whose partners don’t wear a uniform. As if you forfeit softness the moment you marry into the military. As if breaking down means you’re not cut out for it.

Let’s call that what it is: a lie.

Here’s the truth. You’re allowed to unravel. To feel resentful. To be angry at the system that you love to support, worn thin by the emotional calculus you do every day just to keep things moving.

What you did sign up for

You signed up to love someone who serves. You signed up to walk beside them through the unknown. You signed up to build a life together that doesn’t always fit inside a neat timeline or fixed location.

The truth: grace, not grit

In case no one has told you: You’re not weak for finding all of this hard. You’re not dramatic for crying during commercials when you’re three months into deployment. You’re not a bad spouse for counting down the days until your partner comes home and also wanting five minutes of quiet once they do.

You’re human. You’re navigating a life built around sacrifice, uncertainty, and a very inconvenient knack for your spouse getting orders right before your kid finishes third grade.

You deserve support. You deserve softness. You deserve to say, “This is hard,” without someone handing you a lecture in response.

So the next time someone says, “Well, you knew what you were signing up for,” feel free to smile sweetly and reply:

“Sure did. And I still get to talk about it.”",https://www.wearethemighty.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/3345957-e1746745758399.jpg,N,0.0,2025-05-08 19:56:16.272311

4. Jennifer Ellerhoff is the spouse of an E-5 ADSM stationed in Southeast Asia. She is enrolled in a family policy with TRICARE Select. On January 12, Jennifer has a medical encounter in a civilian outpatient clinic. The provider (a nonPAR) charged $240. This is the first medical encounter of the year for Jennifer and her two children. The TRICARE allowable charge (TMAC) for this procedure is $212. After the EOB is received, the clinic sends Jennifer a statement for $212. She calls and asks you why she has to pay this charge. How would you explain the reason why she owes this amount?

Explanation of Charges for Jennifer Ellerhoff

When Jennifer Ellerhoff received a statement for $212 after her medical encounter, it is important to understand how TRICARE Select processes claims and what the patient is responsible for. Here’s a breakdown of the situation:

Key Points

TRICARE Allowable Charge (TMAC): The TMAC for the procedure is $212. This is the maximum amount that TRICARE will reimburse for this service. TRICARE establishes this amount as the maximum allowable charge for covered services, and network providers agree to accept this approved amount as payment in full. However, non-participating providers, like the one Jennifer visited, can charge more than the TMAC.1

Provider Type: The provider is a non-participating provider (nonPAR). NonPAR providers do not have a contract with TRICARE and can charge more than the TMAC. They are allowed to bill the patient for the difference between their charge and the TMAC.2

Cost Sharing: Under TRICARE Select, Jennifer is responsible for a portion of the costs, which includes:

Deductible: If applicable, any deductible must be met before TRICARE starts to pay. TRICARE Select has an annual deductible, which is $300 for an individual and $600 for a family.3

Cost Share: After the deductible, Jennifer may have to pay a percentage of the TMAC as her cost share.

Breakdown of Charges

Provider Charge: $240 (the amount billed by the provider).

TRICARE Allowable Charge: $212 (the amount TRICARE recognizes for payment).

Patient Responsibility: Since the provider is a nonPAR, Jennifer is responsible for the difference between the TMAC and the provider's charge, plus any applicable cost share.

Conclusion

In summary, Jennifer owes the $212 because:

The provider charged $240, but TRICARE only covers up to $212.

As a nonPAR provider, the clinic can bill Jennifer for the full TMAC amount.

Depending on her deductible and cost share, she may be responsible for the entire TMAC amount.

If Jennifer has further questions about her specific deductible or cost share percentages, she should refer to her TRICARE Select plan details or contact TRICARE customer service for clarification.

The company's first-quarter 2025 results revealed a sharp downturn, largely attributed to a temporary payment suspension by one of its major payers, TriCare.

Adding to the company's troubles, this very TriCare payment issue has now become central to a recently announced class action lawsuit filed on behalf of Zynex investors. The lawsuit, Tuncel v.

Disappointing Q1 2025 Results Due to TriCare Suspension

On April 29, 2025, Zynex reported that its net revenue for the first quarter of 2025 plummeted to $26.6 million, a significant drop from the $46.5 million reported in the same period of 2024. The company also experienced a contraction in gross profit margin, falling to 69% in Q1 2025, compared to 80% in the prior year. The bottom line reflected these challenges, with an adjusted EBITDA loss of $11.8 million, a stark contrast to the $1.7 million in adjusted EBITDA recorded in the first quarter of 2024.

On the earnings call, Zynex CEO Thomas Sandgaard directly cited the TriCare payment suspension as a primary driver of the disappointing first-quarter results. He stated that the disruption significantly impacted revenue calculations and prompted the company to initiate a restructuring to prepare for a scenario where TriCare payments remain halted.

Looking ahead, Zynex has offered a muted revenue guidance of $27 million for the second quarter of 2025, with an anticipated EPS loss of $0.20. The company has withheld full-year guidance pending clarity on the TriCare situation, a decision that reflects the significant uncertainty surrounding this key payer relationship.

Analysts on the earnings call voiced concerns that the TriCare situation could create a domino effect, prompting other insurers to re-evaluate their reimbursement policies for Zynex's device.

Zynex Securities Class Action Alleges ""Oversupplying"" Scheme

The payment woes with Tricare appear to be intertwined with more serious allegations leveled against Zynex in a newly filed securities class action.

The core of the lawsuit's allegations mirrors the explanation provided by Zynex for its poor financial performance. Investors claim that the company misled them by failing to disclose practices that ultimately led to the TriCare payment suspension. Specifically, the lawsuit contends that Zynex shipped excessive amounts of products, including electrodes, inflating revenue and drawing scrutiny from insurers like TriCare. The plaintiffs argue that the company should have warned investors about the likely adverse consequences of these practices, including the potential for payment suspensions and removal from insurer networks.

The complaint highlights a more than 5% drop in Zynex's share price following a June 4, 2024 report by STAT detailing an alleged ""oversupplying scheme."" This report, according to the lawsuit, raised concerns about the company's billing practices and likely contributed to the increased scrutiny from payers like TriCare.

The lawsuit further points to a dramatic over 51% plunge in Zynex's share price on March 11, 2025, the day the company reported its disappointing fourth-quarter 2024 results and disclosed the significant TriCare payment suspension.

Hagens Berman's Investigation

Shareholder rights firm Hagens Berman is investigating the alleged claims. ""The significant revenue decline and the revised guidance following the TriCare payment suspension raise serious questions about the accuracy and timeliness of Zynex's prior statements to investors. We are investigating whether the company adequately disclosed the risks associated with its billing practices and its reliance on TriCare revenues,"" said Reed Kathrein, the Hagens Berman Partner leading the firm's probe.

“STIs are estimated to be experienced by about 1 in 5 people in the U.S. every year – this includes service members.
Current U.S. military STI surveillance reports show that rates of chlamydia declined between 2015 and 2023, but chlamydia remains the most commonly detected STI among service members.
“Because many service members who have chlamydia are unaware that they are infected, practicing safe sex and routine testing for chlamydia are essential to preventing further transmission and severe disease outcomes,” says Obuseh.
Most chlamydia infections are asymptomatic, meaning they do not cause noticeable symptoms but can still lead to serious health complications.","Sexually transmitted infections, or STIs, include both sexually transmitted diseases, known as STDs, and the many infections that don’t progress to disease. STIs are caused by more than 30 different organisms, including bacteria, viruses, and parasites, which are transmitted through skin-to-skin and bodily fluid contact during intimate sexual encounters.

The most commonly tracked STIs are chlamydia, gonorrhea, and syphilis. The Department of Defense has had an ongoing battle with them for decades.

“STIs are much more common than many realize,” says Francis Obuseh, a senior epidemiologist and Defense Health Agency–Public Health STI expert. “STIs are estimated to be experienced by about 1 in 5 people in the U.S. every year – this includes service members. Symptomatic infections and long-term complications can compromise service member readiness and well-being.”

Obuseh says the effects of STIs can show up days, weeks or even months after exposure in those who experience signs and/or symptoms. Before they develop symptoms, they may unknowingly pass the infection to other sexual partners.

But those who are symptomatic and seeking care don’t capture the full risk, he says.

“Especially concerning are asymptomatic STI cases, who are people who do not have symptoms but are ‘carriers’ who can still give the infection to others,” says Obuseh. “Unfortunately, many people, both men and women, fall in this asymptomatic category. Since they don’t have symptoms, these infected people typically don’t seek testing and treatment, continuing sexual activity and increasing STI spread.”

The case of chlamydia

Data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention continue to show chlamydia is a significant public health concern among civilians, and military STI surveillance has indicated chlamydia rates among service members are almost two times higher than among civilian U.S. adults.

Current U.S. military STI surveillance reports show that rates of chlamydia declined between 2015 and 2023, but chlamydia remains the most commonly detected STI among service members. The highest rates of chlamydia were observed in the Army and Marine Corps. Service members under 25 years of age were the most commonly infected.

According to recent DHA-PH data, the chlamydia infection rate of female service members is approximately three times higher than that of their male counterparts. However, the higher rates seen in females are thought to be mostly due to the routine testing required among young military women.

“Because many service members who have chlamydia are unaware that they are infected, practicing safe sex and routine testing for chlamydia are essential to preventing further transmission and severe disease outcomes,” says Obuseh.

Obuseh answers several common questions about chlamydia:

How can I prevent chlamydia?

The only way to completely avoid chlamydia is to abstain from vaginal, anal or oral sex. If you are sexually active, you can lower your chances of getting chlamydia by—

Engaging in a long-term, mutually monogamous relationship with a partner who has been tested and does not have chlamydia.

Using condoms the right way, consistently and correctly, every time you have sex.

How do I know if I have chlamydia, and what are the effects?

Most chlamydia infections are asymptomatic, meaning they do not cause noticeable symptoms but can still lead to serious health complications. If symptoms occur, they may not appear until several weeks after exposure.

Women:

Even without symptoms, chlamydia can cause permanent damage to a woman's reproductive system. This can include pelvic inflammatory disease, ectopic (outside the womb) chronic pelvic pain, and may make getting pregnant difficult or even impossible (known as infertility). Chlamydia can also cause a potentially fatal ectopic pregnancy.

Symptoms, if present, may include abnormal or smelly vaginal discharge, a burning sensation when urinating, and/or bleeding between periods.

If pregnant, a woman with chlamydia can give the infection to her baby during delivery, potentially causing serious health problems for the baby.

Men:

Men can be asymptomatic carriers.

Symptoms, if present, may include penile discharge, painful urination and – in some cases – swollen testicles.

Chlamydia can also infect the rectum of men or women. While these infections often cause no symptoms, they can cause rectal pain, discharge and/or bleeding.

Doesn’t the DOD require routine STI screenings for chlamydia?

The DOD does require annual chlamydia testing, which often includes a panel of tests for other STIs such as gonorrhea and syphilis, but the testing is only required for women under 25 years of age. This practice is based on U.S. Preventive Medicine Task Force recommendations, which don’t include routine screening for men since the most serious effects of STIs impact women. The higher rate of chlamydia among women may reflect higher rates of required testing.

Since most male service members do not voluntarily seek STI testing unless they or their partner is experiencing symptoms, they may unknowingly be spreading STI infections, such as chlamydia, to others.

What do I do if I think I might have chlamydia?

See your health care provider if you notice any of the symptoms. You should also see a provider if your partner has an STI or symptoms of one.

Cases may also be more likely to be detected among soldiers because they tend to have more health care access and required STI screening tests than the general population.

Can chlamydia be treated?

Chlamydia is easily detected and treated with antibiotics.

With proper treatment, the infection should resolve within one to two weeks; however, testing may still show positive results for up to four weeks.

Recovery doesn’t mean a person can’t be re-infected, however. A negative test doesn’t mean a future infection won’t develop if a person is exposed to an infected partner again. Since concerns about antibiotic resistance are increasing, especially after repeated treatments, it’s very important to practice safe sex to avoid infections in the first place.

But when in doubt – get tested for treatment before your health is permanently damaged.

The contract awards a total of $30.3 billion over the next 10 years, including a small business component of $1.3 billion.

The PPV program—now in its fifth iteration—includes over $2.6 billion in cost avoidance passed on to customers by leveraging capabilities of the nation’s largest prime vendors, said Catherine Gilbert, Medical contracting officer.

“The contract provides worldwide support to Defense Health Agency, Department of Defense customers, the United States Coast Guard, designated providers, other government agencies, and the US Naval Fleet,” Gilbert said. “[DLA] uses the prime vendor model, a standard commercial practice, to provide pharmaceuticals to military treatment facilities such as hospitals and pharmacies.”

The supply chain utilizing private sector business models can be a benefit to Medical’s customers.

“Mirroring commercial practices through a firm- fixed price requirements contract will result in increased supply efficiencies and return the lowest price to the customer.” Gilbert said.

“It starts with a contractual agreement between the government and the prime vendors who buy inventory from a variety of sources, stores them in commercial warehouses, and ships directly to the customer.”

The PPV Gen V expands DLA’s capabilities to meet new and emerging pharmaceutical customer needs.

“Pharmaceutical items identified as “specialty” have grown significantly over the last few years,” Gilbert said. “These types of drugs are generally higher in dollar value, require monitoring, and are largely for more targeted therapies such as chemotherapy. The industry has shown that specialty drugs need to be distributed differently, and the pricing model must be adjusted accordingly to align with commercial practices. This generation of the PPV program has evolved alongside the pharmaceutical marketplace.”

The contract includes planned and unplanned direct support to the military, said Andrea Del Collo, Medical lead commodity support liaison.

“In addition to normal day-to-day operations, the program supports readiness, which is the rapid acquisition of pharmaceutical requirements to respond to contingency operations for pre-planned and emergent disaster relief,” said Del Collo.

Republican lawmakers are considering billions of dollars in cuts to Medicaid. But a new report finds those spending cuts might impact health-care coverage for thousands of Maryland military families.

The report by the Georgetown Center for Children and Families finds more than 850,000 people enrolled in Medicaid have military health insurance, known as TRICARE, as their primary coverage. One in 10 children of service members with TRICARE is also enrolled in Medicaid.

Joan Alker, executive director of the Georgetown University Center for Children and Families, said Medicaid is important for service members with children who require more intensive health care.

""The TRICARE benefit package just isn't enough, so Medicaid is making TRICARE work for those families by covering the high cost of services and some benefits that those children otherwise would not have access to,"" Alker explained.

Republicans in Congress are trying to reel in what they view as out-of-control spending by $2 trillion in the next budget. But cuts to Medicaid are not universally agreed upon among Republican lawmakers.

Medicaid also serves 40 percent of children in the U.S. with a benefit that allows them to receive preventive and ameliorative care. That benefit began after a military report in the 1960s found young men were not qualified for military service in Vietnam because of preventive medical issues during their childhoods.

Retired Army Brigadier General George Schwartz said Medicaid cuts could have a negative impact on recruiting numbers as well. If troops lack proper coverage for their families, he thinks they may seek other career paths that can provide that coverage.

""As those young people reach the age where they're eligible for military service, the military is competing with private industry and all sorts of organizations for these young people. From a mission readiness point, this is a matter of national security,"" Schwartz contended.

I am not understanding why they didn't file it at the time or get your insurance information from the hospital. Ambulance companies ask for insurance information during the drive and if you are unable to communicate, they will look in your wallet to get your ID and see if there is an insurance card. Most companies know that Tricare is the insurance if there is a military or dependent ID in your wallet so they would have their employees take that info also. If they didn't handle the filing on a timely basis, that is their problem.

Don't forget that the consumer debt laws changed and medical debts can no longer be reported on your credit report.

As a leader, you play a critical role in maintaining the well-being and readiness of your service members. An often-overlooked aspect of a service member's mental and emotional health is their relationship with gambling. While many gamble casually, excessive gambling can have consequences, including financial difficulties, relationship problems and decreased job performance.

The changing face of gambling

Access to gambling has evolved. No longer confined to the gaming halls of the past, it’s now available 24/7 via personal computers and smartphones. A recent review of gambling and problematic gambling published in the August 2024 journal of public health, The Lancet, estimated the amount of money lost to gambling worldwide in 2025 will be nearly $531 billion.

Moreover, The Lancet study also found that 46% of adults and 18% of adolescents have gambled within the last 12 months. A January 2024 study conducted by the Connecticut Department of Mental Health and Addiction Services found that nearly 70% of its residents acknowledged gambling in the past year, with 10.7% gambling online and 10.2% betting on sports. In Department of Defense studies conducted over the past 30 years, 6.3-7.1% of service members reported having at least one gambling issue.

The Impact of Excessive Gambling on Military Service Members

Excessive gambling, also known as problem gambling, is a pattern of behavior that can lead to significant distress and impairment in daily life.

The military lifestyle can lead some service members to be inclined to excessive gambling. Some of those factors include:

• Using gambling to relieve periods of stress and anxiousness

• Turning to gambling to combat boredom, such as during extended periods of “hurry-up and wait”

• Easy access to online betting platforms and, in some duty locations, gaming facilities

• Social pressures from peers, especially while viewing sporting events

• Limited financial literacy and budgeting skills

Excessive gambling can have serious consequences for service members, including:

• Financial difficulties, such as debt and bankruptcy

• Relationship problems, including marital issues and estrangement from family and friends

• Decreased job performance and reduced readiness

• Increased risk of mental health problems, such as depression and anxiety

• Risk of increased alcohol, tobacco and substance abuse

• Disruptions to unit cohesion and morale

Warning Signs of Excessive Gambling

Early identification is critical in addressing excessive gambling. Leaders play a key role in identifying those struggling with this issue. Be on the lookout for the following warning signs:

• Changes in behavior, such as increased irritability or mood swings

• Concerns or difficulties with paying bills or debts on time

• Frequent borrowing or requests for financial assistance

• Unexplained absences or tardiness

• Decreased participation in unit activities or social events

• Social media posts or conversations suggesting excessive gaming or betting

Strategies for Leader Support for Service Members who may be having gambling issues

Leaders need to take steps to identify and support service members who may be struggling with excessive gambling.

• Maintain an open-door policy: Encourage service members to come forward and discuss their concerns or struggles with excessive gambling

• Foster a supportive unit culture: Promote open communication to help reduce stigma around mental health concerns, including excessive gambling

• Promote peer support: Enable mentorship programs to help foster a culture of trust and provide a responsive support network

• Conduct regular unit assessments: Consistently assess unit cohesion and morale to identify potential issues, including those related to excessive gambling

• Identify and support the use of financial education and resources: Ensure service members know the base or installation services that offer budgeting and money management training

• Ensure access to counseling and support services: Make service members aware of, and facilitate access to, available services, including substance abuse treatment programs and financial counseling

• Develop a policy on excessive gambling: Mirror existing unit policies or develop a policy on excessive gambling and betting, including consequences for excessive behavior

• Maintain regular performance evaluations: Discuss any potential personal issues, such as excessive gaming or betting, as part of regular performance evaluations

• Stay informed: Keep up to date on the latest research and trends related to excessive gambling by military service members

Conclusion

Excessive gambling is a serious issue that can lead to significant consequences for service members. Leaders are critical in identifying and supporting service members struggling with this issue. By maintaining an open-door policy, conducting regular unit assessments, and providing financial education and resources, military leaders can help service members who may be struggling with excessive gambling.

Remember, early identification and support are key in addressing excessive gambling. Working together can help service members overcome this issue and maintain their overall well-being and readiness.

""The program is individualized to the nurses,” McNeal said.
The program intentionally fosters community and teamwork among new Army nurses, recognizing that isolation can be challenging.
Program participants also devote a significant amount of time to volunteer work.
I am proud to be a part of this team and to contribute to the development of the next generation of Army nurse leaders.","Tripler Army Medical Center, Hawaii — A group of six U.S. Army Nurses took the stage in Tripler Army Medical Center’s Kyser Auditorium on April 25, celebrating their completion of the hospital’s Clinical Nurse Transition Program.

Across the Military Health System, hospitals and clinics depend on highly skilled, well-trained nurses to provide high-quality patient care to active duty service members, veterans, and their families. Tripler’s CNTP is one of the programs that trains these nurses.

""These are new grads who have never worked as a registered nurse and are coming to us from the Basic Officer Leadership Course,” said Tina McNeal, director of TAMC’s CNTP program. “It's our job to show they are competent and confident nurses. With guidance from qualified preceptors, we provide a safe and supportive environment for nurses and patients, prioritizing patient safety and nurse development.""

The CNTP, which falls under Tripler’s Directorate of Health and Education Training, is an accelerated program designed to cultivate new Army nurses by transitioning them from academics to clinical practice while also developing the leadership skills and competencies necessary to excel as an Army officer.

New nurses begin the program with a 45-day orientation and onboarding phase. The next 12 weeks of CNTP are dedicated to one-to-one precepted time. Each new nurse is paired with an experienced and qualified preceptor, and the precepted time is tailored to each nurse's needs. Experienced preceptors provide individualized guidance and feedback.

""The program is individualized to the nurses,” McNeal said. “Some of the nurses come in with experience or enlistee experience. Some of the nurses might progress quicker than 12 weeks. There's an evaluation tool that preceptors use to track progress against benchmarks. Our program isn't prescriptive. If a nurse isn't meeting benchmarks, that's okay. We create a plan that supports nurses who need extra time.""

One of the successes of TAMC's CNTP program was revamping their evidence-based practice requirement, condensing it from six months to a two-day workshop at the end of precepted time. This change allowed nurses to collaborate, develop projects, and present to leaders, resulting in a more engaging and practical experience. The success of this approach led to its adoption as a recommended model for all CNTP sites, demonstrating the impact of TAMC’s innovative solution.

""They are standing up in their dress uniforms in front of the Chief Nursing Officer, Deputy Commander of Surgical Services, and other deputy lane section chiefs, and presenting a professional presentation.” McNeal said. “That's a huge success.”

One of the elements that sets TAMC's program apart is a sponsorship program, connecting participants with clinical learning, personalized support, and communication that begins before participants even arrive in Hawaii. This proactive approach helps new nurses navigate the unique challenges of military life, ensuring a smooth transition and reducing anxiety about the unknowns of Army culture, protocols, and expectations.

“We provide personalized support 30-plus days before arrival, including airport pickup, hotel accommodations, and resource coordination,” said Maj. Daniel J. Hines, assistant director of the program. ""Our goal is to immerse them in Tripler's culture and Army life, ensuring a smooth onboarding, which often includes relocation, deployment, benefits, and managing money.""

The program intentionally fosters community and teamwork among new Army nurses, recognizing that isolation can be challenging. By encouraging volunteer work, social events, and team-building activities, such as participating in marathons and celebrating the Army Nurse Corps Birthday, nurses develop essential networking skills and learn to rely on each other.

Program participants also devote a significant amount of time to volunteer work. The recent cohort volunteered more than 200 hours in the past eight months, with many members pursuing the Military Outstanding Volunteer Service Medal. The cohort earned first place in this year’s TAMC Safety Video campaign, lead unit physical trainings, and were key participants in the Army Nurse Corps Birthday celebration. This group participated in Initial Combat Training and Leader Development, which help increase the overall numbers for the Combat Medical Specialist role within the Army.

The cohort also participates in volunteer work supporting the greater Oahu community. Teams provided medical support for the last three Honolulu Marathons. They also participated in a project to restore the ecosystem of Honolulu’s Ala Wai Canal, creating nearly 1,000 Genki Balls — mud balls filled with microorganisms that digest sludge and act as a “probiotic” for the environment.

“We are putting them in situations where they must lean on each other,” Hines said. “This approach helps to identify emerging leaders and creates a cohesive unit that can work together seamlessly, even in high-pressure situations like a code on the floor.”

The program’s success is a testament to the dedication and passion of its leaders.

“With her unwavering commitment to excellence, she has maintained an elevated standard, even in the face of changing military landscapes,” Hines said, “Her tireless efforts have created a program that not only produces exceptional nurses but also fosters a sense of community and camaraderie among its participants.”

Having personally experienced the struggles of transitioning into clinical practice as a new nurse, McNeal knows firsthand the challenges that can come with being thrown into a high-stakes environment without adequate support. Her own difficult transition, which nearly led her to leave the profession, has fueled her passion for creating a better experience for others.

McNeal has dedicated herself to developing a comprehensive and supportive program that sets them up for success, rather than leaving them to navigate the complexities of clinical practice alone.

“I do love it, so it makes it easy,” McNeal said. “I do love the job! I am proud to be a part of this team and to contribute to the development of the next generation of Army nurse leaders. That’s why I love it.”",https://d1ldvf68ux039x.cloudfront.net/thumbs/photos/2505/9021860/1000w_q95.jpg,N,0.0,2025-05-08 17:56:38.455827

The session, led Acting Principal Deputy Assistant Secretary of Defense for Health Affairs and Acting Director of Defense Health Agency Dr. David Smith, highlighted how each service is tackling the evolving demands of warfighting while working together to transform military medicine.

The forum brought together “the leaders who are in the forefront of military medicine, and are visionaries who have dedicated their careers to safeguarding the health, readiness, and resilience of our service members,” said Smith.

In a time of new emerging global threats, emerging medical challenges and technological advancements, Smith said, “Their collaboration and shared expertise has never been more important and critical,” referring to the surgeons.

Service-Specific Readiness Challenges and Initiatives

U.S. Army Lt. Gen. Mary Izaguirre, U.S. Army surgeon general, highlighted the U.S. Army's focus on continuous transformation and partnerships, emphasizing the integration of medics into formations and the importance of local, organizational, and international collaborations. She stressed learning from past successes and from current partners like Ukraine.

U.S. Air Force Lt. Gen. John DeGoes, U.S. Air Force and U.S. Space Force surgeon general, discussed the changing role of medics, emphasizing the need for agile combat employment and redesigned training and equipment. He stressed the interconnectedness of healthcare delivery and readiness. DeGoes said the future hinges on combat-ready medics who can operate in “complex, contested environments,” and noted the service has restructured how medics are embedded into operational squadrons.

U.S. Navy Rear Adm. Darin Via, U.S. Navy surgeon general, focused on total sailor readiness and the conflict between generating readiness at high-volume medical centers and meeting the needs of geographically dispersed units. He highlighted innovative partnerships with civilian trauma centers and the development of an enterprise approach to integrate fleet needs into health service governance. Via emphasized building “total sailor readiness,” including mind, body and spirit. That includes leveraging partnerships with local trauma centers, where medics train in high-volume, high-acuity settings.

U.S. Marine Corps Rear Adm. Pamela Miller, medical officer of the Marine Corps, and deputy chief of Bureau of Medicine and Surgery, Reserve Policy and Integration, discussed the parallel transformation of health services alongside Force Design 2030, emphasizing prolonged casualty care, blood supply in dispersed environments, and joint force training. She stressed the importance of building trust with Marines through consistent, high-quality care. “Our corpsmen are going to be at the pointy end of the spear,” Miller said. “We’re asking them to do more with less, and to be ready for something even our most senior leaders haven’t seen in decades.”

U.S. Army Maj. Gen. Lisa Hou, director, Office of the Joint Surgeon General, U.S. National Guard Bureau, outlined the unique challenges of the U.S. National Guard's dual mission of warfighting and homeland defense, emphasizing the need for more time and resources for training, particularly in trauma care. She discussed partnerships with civilian hospitals and the state partnership program. For the U.S. National Guard, which forms 20% of the joint force on 4% of the Department of Defense’s budget, the challenge is time and access, Hou said, She also noted that funding and licensing barriers may hold the service back.

U.S. Air Force Brig. Gen. John Andrus, U.S. Joint Staff surgeon, emphasized the need for joint qualification pathways for medics, integrated governance, normalization of processes, and enterprise management. He highlighted the importance of global integration and interoperability. He said the MHS and services need to be continually enhancing. “If we are not undergoing change, we are not growing. We are not learning, we are not adapting, we are not becoming better, and that change is really important,” said Andrus.

Despite challenges with staffing, funding and access, all leaders agreed: Readiness requires integration—across services, with civilian partners, and with allies around the world.

Serfass explained that after military service, he chose to become a therapist when he witnessed firsthand the shortage of mental health resources for soldiers.
""Most of our clients have trauma — many with military sexual trauma,"" Harris said.
The VA can't handle them all if they don't have support from the civilian mental health side.""
I give the service, and then we are paid for that service,"" Harris said.","KILLEEN, Texas — Mental health providers treating military personnel and their families across Central Texas are facing a financial crisis that threatens to leave thousands without critical care.

Since January 1, when TriWest Healthcare Alliance took over as TRICARE's contractor for Texas and five other states, providers report going unpaid for services, some for as long as four months.

At Restorative Hope Sanctuary in Temple, therapists Kevin Serfass and Joanne Harris have been covering business expenses out of their own pockets while continuing to treat their 269 clients, approximately 80% of whom use TRICARE.

""Rather than turn away the clients, we've been sustaining our finances, but we're at the fourth month and we can't anymore,"" said Serfass, a retired military veteran who specializes in trauma treatment. ""They owe us over $70,000.""

Serfass explained that after military service, he chose to become a therapist when he witnessed firsthand the shortage of mental health resources for soldiers.

""I had a bunch of soldiers who had just returned from a rotation. Some of them were on their second or third rotation downrange,"" Serfass said. ""I could tell they were having problems. I was trying to get them in to see therapists, and it came to my awareness that we were lucky if we could get them in once or twice a month because there was such a shortage in the area.""

Harris, who has served the military community for over 20 years, emphasized the impact closure would have on patients dealing with trauma.

""Most of our clients have trauma — many with military sexual trauma,"" Harris said. ""If I were to stop seeing them, that whole group of women would have to start their trauma over with someone else. And they probably won't go back because many of them didn't even say anything about it until they came and sat with me.""

The payment issues appear to stem from technical failures in TriWest's new system. Providers across the region have reported similar problems — spending hours on hold with customer service, receiving inconsistent answers, and having no clear timeline for resolution.

""Our billing individual has gone to bat with us repeatedly,"" Serfass explained. ""They've told her 'Yes, all your claims are filed and we're good,' and she'll call back two days later and get another person to say there've been no claims filed, like they were gone.""

The crisis extends beyond mental health to physical therapy and other medical providers across Texas, Arkansas, Illinois, Louisiana, Oklahoma, and Wisconsin — all states where TriWest recently took over as TRICARE's contractor.

Serfass points out broader implications for military healthcare access.

""The reason that we exist and work in conjunction with TRICARE and the VA is because the VA cannot support the sheer numbers,"" Serfass said. ""We were at war in Iraq for 9 years, in Afghanistan for 19 years. The VA can't handle them all if they don't have support from the civilian mental health side.""

Words aren't enough for providers like Serfass and Harris, who have contacted congressional representatives seeking intervention.

""We have a contract. I give the service, and then we are paid for that service,"" Harris said. ""If I don't do what I'm supposed to, I'm penalized. But where's the penalty to them?""

Despite the financial strain, Serfass and Harris remain committed to their patients.

""We will not change our care until we receive the eviction notice and have to leave,"" Serfass said. ""That's the only way they'll get us out of here.""

Serfass says even if evicted, he'll continue finding ways to treat his clients.

""I'll probably rent an office for $300 to $400. I'll put a bucket at the door, and I'll still work with my clients and treat them and say 'Drop $20 or $40 in it on the way out.' That's the best I can do.""

In a statement to 6 News, a TriWest Healthcare Alliance spokesperson said: ""We recognize that any provider who has not been paid in a timely fashion, or any beneficiary who has an issue accessing behavioral health services, is one too many. We are deeply committed to Killeen and Fort Hood's providers and military families. We won't rest until our military community and network of providers experience the excellent standard of service TriWest is capable of and committed to delivering.""",https://media.kcentv.com/assets/KCEN/images/afbab638-be46-4605-85c4-22ed7cce0bc6/20250507T220453/afbab638-be46-4605-85c4-22ed7cce0bc6_1140x641.jpg,N,0.0,2025-05-07 19:56:19.417941

Globe Newswire 7-May-2025 2:59 PM

SAN FRANCISCO, May 07, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Medical technology company Zynex, Inc. (NASDAQ:ZYXI) is facing a double whammy linked to its dealings with TriCare, the healthcare program for the U.S. military community. The company's first-quarter 2025 results revealed a sharp downturn, largely attributed to a temporary payment suspension by one of its major payers, TriCare.

Adding to the company's troubles, this very TriCare payment issue has now become central to a recently announced class action lawsuit filed on behalf of Zynex investors. The lawsuit, Tuncel v. Zynex, Inc., No. 25-cv-00913 (D. Colo.), alleges that Zynex and certain top executives violated federal securities laws between March 13, 2023, and March 11, 2025.

Hagens Berman is investigating the alleged claims and urges Zynex investors to submit your losses now.

Disappointing Q1 2025 Results Due to TriCare Suspension

On April 29, 2025, Zynex reported that its net revenue for the first quarter of 2025 plummeted to $26.6 million, a significant drop from the $46.5 million reported in the same period of 2024. The company also experienced a contraction in gross profit margin, falling to 69% in Q1 2025, compared to 80% in the prior year. The bottom line reflected these challenges, with an adjusted EBITDA loss of $11.8 million, a stark contrast to the $1.7 million in adjusted EBITDA recorded in the first quarter of 2024.

On the earnings call, Zynex CEO Thomas Sandgaard directly cited the TriCare payment suspension as a primary driver of the disappointing first-quarter results. He stated that the disruption significantly impacted revenue calculations and prompted the company to initiate a restructuring to prepare for a scenario where TriCare payments remain halted.

Looking ahead, Zynex has offered a muted revenue guidance of $27 million for the second quarter of 2025, with an anticipated EPS loss of $0.20. The company has withheld full-year guidance pending clarity on the TriCare situation, a decision that reflects the significant uncertainty surrounding this key payer relationship.

Analysts on the earnings call voiced concerns that the TriCare situation could create a domino effect, prompting other insurers to re-evaluate their reimbursement policies for Zynex's device.

Zynex Securities Class Action Alleges ""Oversupplying"" Scheme

The payment woes with Tricare appear to be intertwined with more serious allegations leveled against Zynex in a newly filed securities class action.

The core of the lawsuit's allegations mirrors the explanation provided by Zynex for its poor financial performance. Investors claim that the company misled them by failing to disclose practices that ultimately led to the TriCare payment suspension. Specifically, the lawsuit contends that Zynex shipped excessive amounts of products, including electrodes, inflating revenue and drawing scrutiny from insurers like TriCare. The plaintiffs argue that the company should have warned investors about the likely adverse consequences of these practices, including the potential for payment suspensions and removal from insurer networks.

The complaint highlights a more than 5% drop in Zynex's share price following a June 4, 2024 report by STAT detailing an alleged ""oversupplying scheme."" This report, according to the lawsuit, raised concerns about the company's billing practices and likely contributed to the increased scrutiny from payers like TriCare.

The lawsuit further points to a dramatic over 51% plunge in Zynex's share price on March 11, 2025, the day the company reported its disappointing fourth-quarter 2024 results and disclosed the significant TriCare payment suspension.

Hagens Berman's Investigation

Shareholder rights firm Hagens Berman is investigating the alleged claims. ""The significant revenue decline and the revised guidance following the TriCare payment suspension raise serious questions about the accuracy and timeliness of Zynex's prior statements to investors. We are investigating whether the company adequately disclosed the risks associated with its billing practices and its reliance on TriCare revenues,"" said Reed Kathrein, the Hagens Berman Partner leading the firm's probe.

(NASDAQ: ZYXI) is facing a double whammy linked to its dealings with TriCare, the healthcare program for the U.S. military community. The company's first-quarter 2025 results revealed a sharp downturn, largely attributed to a temporary payment suspension by one of its major payers, TriCare.

Adding to the company’s troubles, this very TriCare payment issue has now become central to a recently announced class action lawsuit filed on behalf of Zynex investors. The lawsuit, Tuncel v. Zynex, Inc., No. 25-cv-00913 (D. Colo.), alleges that Zynex and certain top executives violated federal securities laws between March 13, 2023, and March 11, 2025.

Hagens Berman is investigating the alleged claims and urges Zynex investors to submit your losses now.

Disappointing Q1 2025 Results Due to TriCare Suspension

On April 29, 2025, Zynex reported that its net revenue for the first quarter of 2025 plummeted to $26.6 million, a significant drop from the $46.5 million reported in the same period of 2024. The company also experienced a contraction in gross profit margin, falling to 69% in Q1 2025, compared to 80% in the prior year. The bottom line reflected these challenges, with an adjusted EBITDA loss of $11.8 million, a stark contrast to the $1.7 million in adjusted EBITDA recorded in the first quarter of 2024.

On the earnings call, Zynex CEO Thomas Sandgaard directly cited the TriCare payment suspension as a primary driver of the disappointing first-quarter results. He stated that the disruption significantly impacted revenue calculations and prompted the company to initiate a restructuring to prepare for a scenario where TriCare payments remain halted.

Looking ahead, Zynex has offered a muted revenue guidance of $27 million for the second quarter of 2025, with an anticipated EPS loss of $0.20. The company has withheld full-year guidance pending clarity on the TriCare situation, a decision that reflects the significant uncertainty surrounding this key payer relationship.

Analysts on the earnings call voiced concerns that the TriCare situation could create a domino effect, prompting other insurers to re-evaluate their reimbursement policies for Zynex's device.

Zynex Securities Class Action Alleges ""Oversupplying"" Scheme

The payment woes with Tricare appear to be intertwined with more serious allegations leveled against Zynex in a newly filed securities class action.

The core of the lawsuit’s allegations mirrors the explanation provided by Zynex for its poor financial performance. Investors claim that the company misled them by failing to disclose practices that ultimately led to the TriCare payment suspension. Specifically, the lawsuit contends that Zynex shipped excessive amounts of products, including electrodes, inflating revenue and drawing scrutiny from insurers like TriCare. The plaintiffs argue that the company should have warned investors about the likely adverse consequences of these practices, including the potential for payment suspensions and removal from insurer networks.

The complaint highlights a more than 5% drop in Zynex's share price following a June 4, 2024 report by STAT detailing an alleged ""oversupplying scheme."" This report, according to the lawsuit, raised concerns about the company's billing practices and likely contributed to the increased scrutiny from payers like TriCare.

The lawsuit further points to a dramatic over 51% plunge in Zynex's share price on March 11, 2025, the day the company reported its disappointing fourth-quarter 2024 results and disclosed the significant TriCare payment suspension.

Hagens Berman’s Investigation

Shareholder rights firm Hagens Berman is investigating the alleged claims. “The significant revenue decline and the revised guidance following the TriCare payment suspension raise serious questions about the accuracy and timeliness of Zynex's prior statements to investors. We are investigating whether the company adequately disclosed the risks associated with its billing practices and its reliance on TriCare revenues,” said Reed Kathrein, the Hagens Berman Partner leading the firm’s probe.

This week, we honor the strength and dedication of the extraordinary professionals who serve both our country and warfighters with unwavering courage. Whether they are on the frontlines, in field hospitals or at military medical centers around the world, their commitment to care under the most challenging conditions inspires us all.

The Power of Nurses

Nurses are a powerful force for many reasons. They advocate for their patients, they take on multiple roles to deliver care, and they break barriers to work across disciplines and teams—always keeping the patient front and center.

Roughly 30 million people around the world—including our active duty service members of all ranks, National Guard and Reserve members, civilians and contractors—dedicate their lives to nursing. Just over 17,000 nurses, military and civilian, serve every day across the globe in our military health system. Even after decades of serving as a nurse myself, I am still inspired by their resilience, depth of knowledge, and steadfast commitment to advancing the health of others.

Nurses Advocate for their Patients

One of the many ways nurses support our health is by constantly advocating for patients. Whether they are talking to a new Marine who has questions about her medications or is struggling to make an appointment, or a veteran who needs a compassionate ear to talk through his diagnosis that he may not fully understand, nurses keep our best interest at heart and calmly guide us through often difficult and uncharted territory.

One such nurse is Bianca Rodriguez, a breast nurse navigator at Brooke Army Medical Center. She arranges surgery, acts as a go-between for the patient and his or her provider, and helps to arrange transportation to and from appointments.

Nurses like Rodriguez support each and every one of us with compassionate care from the moment we arrive at a healthcare facility, to the moment we leave and during recovery. They heal not only physical wounds but can build trust to mend internal, personal challenges that often remain hidden from the outside world.

Nurses Care for Patients through Multiple Roles

Nurses all around the world serve many different roles, both in and outside of health care. In addition to patient care and clinical roles they also serve in research labs and classrooms as educators and mentors, evaluate data to improve patient care systems, and lead the optimization of the Defense Health Agency.

With their expertise and knowledge, nurses often respond to emergencies when they are least expected. In April, U.S. Army Maj. Joshua Goldberg, the Department of Education chief at Evans Army Community Hospital, with the help of his wife, Kaylanda Pinkerton, the chief nurse for the Mountain Post Birthing Center, was recognized with the Soldier’s Medal for heroism during a crisis. When gunshots rang out near their son’s football game, they immediately sprang into action. They rushed to the parking lot where they found a victim with multiple gunshot wounds. Without hesitation, Goldberg immediately began CPR until the paramedics arrived. This is just one example that shows the readiness of our nurses to act in the interest of others at a moment’s notice.

Nurses Wield an Inspirational Power to Collaborate

When I joined the United States Public Health Service, one of the first things I noticed was the unique power of nurses to collaborate across disciplines. It’s truly an art. Transcending traditional boundary, nurses will stop at nothing to ensure patients receive the utmost care when they need it.

I saw this firsthand last month when I visited military hospitals and clinics in Japan. There, supply chains face lengthy logistical hurdles, with the procurement of medical supplies, pharmaceuticals, and equipment requiring more extensive lead time compared to stateside facilities. What struck me most during my visit was the team's collaboration to overcome these challenges. Not only have the medical staff within the military hospitals and clinics successfully built relationships within the Japanese healthcare system, but they also work with U.S. Air Force, U.S. Navy, and U.S. Army medical personnel to provide seamless care. This collaboration led to partnerships between the joint neonatal intensive care unit operations and related evacuations between the United States Naval Hospital Okinawa-Japan and the Naval Hospital Yokosuka.

I am not the only one who noticed the team’s innovation and collaboration; the hospitals’ compassionate and innovative nurses received a DAISY Award—an internationally recognized professional award that celebrates nurses who have made profound differences in the lives of others.

Lean-in with Thought and Curiosity, and Do Not be Shy

We are in a dynamic moment in history. With lessons-learned from deployments domestically and internationally, new artificial intelligence tools to deliver optimized health care, and an ever-changing digital landscape streamlining our processes, we have an opportunity to lean-in with thought and curiosity. To my fellow nurses: Do not be shy. Even in times of uncertainty, situations that may seem uncomfortable are not designed to frustrate us; they are designed to help us grow.

Our shared responsibility to support the warfighter has never been more critical. From providing care in the Pacific Northwest to the most remote regions of the Indo-Pacific, our responsibility to support, strengthen, and sustain our warfighters’ health and readiness to fight knows no boundaries. We must remain ready to act and continue to provide the highest-quality care whenever and wherever we are needed.

One of our goals as nurses is to create a world where good health is in the reach of every person. By building on the core power of patient advocacy, unwavering care, and collaboration engrained in our craft by those who came before us, I am confident that we will reach our goal.

To all nurses and their families around the world, thank you.

More About Brighton Marine

Brighton Marine was founded in 1983 in Brighton, MA. when the federal government decided to close many hospitals within the public hospital system, including the Brighton Marine hospital, which provided vital healthcare needs to local veterans. The organization, which eventually became Brighton Marine, was then called the Allston-Brighton Aid and Health Group.

Today, Brighton Marine continues through its core programs and services:

Healthcare: Brighton Marine operates the Uniformed Services Family Health Plan of Southern New England and its Brighton campus is home to 10 community health organizations which collectively serve over 15,000 Veterans, active-duty service members and their families.

Housing: Brighton Marine campus provides affordable housing on campus through The Residences, a six-story multi-family housing complex built in 2020 with more than 100 units of affordable housing with preference to Veterans and their families and the newly re-named Derrick Hassell Veterans Living community.

Two symposium presentations spotlighted DHA R&D-MRDC’s unique capabilities for rapidly commercializing new military medical products to ensure they can be used effectively to help Warfighters maintain their operational effectiveness when operating in chemically and biologically compromised environments.

The first presentation featured Dr. Chandar Thakur, chief of the Medical Devices and Diagnostics Branch at DHA R&D-MRDC’s Office of Regulated Activities, discussing how ORA’s regulatory affairs, compliance and clinical support professionals guide regulated medical products through the rigorous review process required by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration before they can be considered safe for use by humans. ORA specializes in identifying and mitigating risks early in the product development life cycle, which accelerates the delivery of lifesaving drugs, biologics, medical devices, and combination products to the Warfighter.

“The labs within DHA R&D-MRDC focus on a wide variety of portfolios, anywhere from simple bandages to high-risk medical devices, and our responsibility is to provide the risk mitigation to those product development efforts across the enterprise,” explained Thakur, DHA R&D-MRDC’s 2025 Employee of the Year. “We are a unique capability within the DOD, and we can work with anyone as long as they have some sort of DOD connection.”

The second presentation, by Amanda Corbel, the mid-Atlantic regional coordinator for the Federal Laboratory Consortium for Technology Transfer, focused on the important role that disseminating intellectual property plays in getting life-saving military medical products into the field quickly and cost-effectively. DHA R&D-MRDC’s Office of Medical Technology Transfer works with inventors throughout the DOD to identify sources of funding, address regulatory and licensing requirements, find facilities that can develop and test prototypes, and even assist with sales and marketing of their products, helping to ensure that the inventions will be mature, de-risked, and ready for manufacture – significantly improving their value to potential licensors.

Dr. Yun-Xing Wang, a structural biologist at the National Cancer Institute, gave the keynote address at this year’s event. His presentation, “Why RNA is Fun and More Interesting but Challenging to Study --- A Structural Biologist’s Point of View,” discussed the latest research being conducted at NCI in support of the development of RNA-based therapies that may someday be used to treat deadly cancers in Service Members, helping improve their fitness and readiness.

The Capt. Jennifer J. Shafer Odom Fitness Center hosted vendor booths for 39 military medical companies, organizations, and professional associations, as well as 95 poster exhibits showcasing advanced research recently completed or currently underway by researchers representing the spectrum of military medicine research and development.

• U.S. Navy Rear Adm. Darin Via, U.S. Navy surgeon general, focused on total sailor readiness and the conflict between generating readiness at high-volume medical centers and meeting the needs of geographically dispersed units.
He highlighted innovative partnerships with civilian trauma centers and the development of an enterprise approach to integrate fleet needs into health service governance.
Gen. John Andrus, U.S. Joint Staff surgeon, emphasized the need for joint qualification pathways for medics, integrated governance, normalization of processes, and enterprise management.

The session, led Acting Principal Deputy Assistant Secretary of Defense for Health Affairs and Acting Director of Defense Health Agency Dr. David Smith, highlighted how each service is tackling the evolving demands of warfighting while working together to transform military medicine.

The forum brought together “the leaders who are in the forefront of military medicine, and are visionaries who have dedicated their careers to safeguarding the health, readiness, and resilience of our service members,” said Smith.

In a time of new emerging global threats, emerging medical challenges and technological advancements, Smith said, “Their collaboration and shared expertise has never been more important and critical,” referring to the surgeons.

Service-Specific Readiness Challenges and Initiatives

• U.S. Army Lt. Gen. Mary Izaguirre, U.S. Army surgeon general, highlighted the U.S. Army's focus on continuous transformation and partnerships, emphasizing the integration of medics into formations and the importance of local, organizational, and international collaborations. She stressed learning from past successes and from current partners like Ukraine.

• U.S. Air Force Lt. Gen. John DeGoes, U.S. Air Force and U.S. Space Force surgeon general, discussed the changing role of medics, emphasizing the need for agile combat employment and redesigned training and equipment. He stressed the interconnectedness of healthcare delivery and readiness.

DeGoes said the future hinges on combat-ready medics who can operate in “complex, contested environments,” and noted the service has restructured how medics are embedded into operational squadrons.

• U.S. Navy Rear Adm. Darin Via, U.S. Navy surgeon general, focused on total sailor readiness and the conflict between generating readiness at high-volume medical centers and meeting the needs of geographically dispersed units. He highlighted innovative partnerships with civilian trauma centers and the development of an enterprise approach to integrate fleet needs into health service governance.

Via emphasized building “total sailor readiness,” including mind, body and spirit. That includes leveraging partnerships with local trauma centers, where medics train in high-volume, high-acuity settings.

• U.S. Marine Corps Rear Adm. Pamela Miller, medical officer of the Marine Corps, and deputy chief of Bureau of Medicine and Surgery, Reserve Policy and Integration, discussed the parallel transformation of health services alongside Force Design 2030, emphasizing prolonged casualty care, blood supply in dispersed environments, and joint force training. She stressed the importance of building trust with Marines through consistent, high-quality care.

“Our corpsmen are going to be at the pointy end of the spear,” Miller said. “We’re asking them to do more with less, and to be ready for something even our most senior leaders haven’t seen in decades.”

• U.S. Army Maj. Gen. Lisa Hou, director, Office of the Joint Surgeon General, U.S. National Guard Bureau, outlined the unique challenges of the U.S. National Guard's dual mission of warfighting and homeland defense, emphasizing the need for more time and resources for training, particularly in trauma care. She discussed partnerships with civilian hospitals and the state partnership program.

For the U.S. National Guard, which forms 20% of the joint force on 4% of the Department of Defense’s budget, the challenge is time and access, Hou said, She also noted that funding and licensing barriers may hold the service back.

• U.S. Air Force Brig. Gen. John Andrus, U.S. Joint Staff surgeon, emphasized the need for joint qualification pathways for medics, integrated governance, normalization of processes, and enterprise management. He highlighted the importance of global integration and interoperability.

He said the MHS and services need to be continually enhancing. “If we are not undergoing change, we are not growing. We are not learning, we are not adapting, we are not becoming better, and that change is really important,” said Andrus.

Despite challenges with staffing, funding and access, all leaders agreed: Readiness requires integration—across services, with civilian partners, and with allies around the world.

Via concluded by asking those who wear the uniform to “find problems, fix problems, or elevate problems, and fail fast and run with scissors.”",https://d1ldvf68ux039x.cloudfront.net/thumbs/photos/2505/9008057/1000w_q95.jpg,N,0.0,2025-05-07 10:56:40.398919

“Answering the call to serve often means making a great number of sacrifices for your country,” Strickland said.
This bill removes current barriers in TRICARE and helps ensure that all service members can access the fertility care they deserve to start a family.” Barbara Collura, president and chief executive officer of RESOLVE: The National Infertility Association, said the country’s servicemembers deserve access to the full spectrum of medical care to build their families, including in vitro fertilization.
""The ‘Expanding Access to Fertility Care for Servicemembers and Dependents Act’ is a critical piece of legislation,” said Karla Torres, senior human rights counsel for the Center for Reproductive Rights.
“By removing legal barriers that currently exclude from insurance coverage servicemembers whose infertility is not directly service-related, and safeguarding against discrimination in coverage of this care, the Act gets us closer to ensuring that all servicemembers and their dependents can have equitable and non-discriminatory access to the fertility health care they need to build their families.""","On April 24, during National Infertility Awareness Week, Congresswoman Marilyn Strickland, D-Tacoma, led the reintroduction of the “Expanding Access to Fertility Care for Servicemembers and Dependents Act.”

The bill would expand TRICARE coverage to make assisted reproductive services, including in vitro fertilization (IVF), available to all active duty service members, including National Guard and reserve members, as well as their dependents — regardless of service-connection requirements, sex, gender, sexual orientation or marital status.

The act has been endorsed by RESOLVE: The National Infertility Association, American Society for Reproductive Medicine (ASRM), the Center for Reproductive Rights and the Modern Military Association of America.

“Answering the call to serve often means making a great number of sacrifices for your country,” Strickland said. “Being able to start a family should not be one of them. This bill removes current barriers in TRICARE and helps ensure that all service members can access the fertility care they deserve to start a family.”

Barbara Collura, president and chief executive officer of RESOLVE: The National Infertility Association, said the country’s servicemembers deserve access to the full spectrum of medical care to build their families, including in vitro fertilization. Collura said 85 percent of Americans support access to IVF, calling it “one of the most effective medical treatments for those struggling to build their family.”

“Expanding TRICARE coverage to include IVF and fertility care is not just the right thing to do — it’s a critical investment in the health and wellbeing of military families,” Collura said. “RESOLVE stands strongly in support of this long-overdue change, and we urge Congress to act swiftly to ensure that no one who serves our country is denied the chance to become a parent.”

Sean Tipton, chief advocacy and policy officer for ASRM, thanked Strickland, Delegate Eleanor Holmes Norton, Rep. Mark Takano and Rep. Ayanna Pressley for “calling attention to the fact that current Department of Defense (DOD) policy — which limits TRICARE coverage for fertility treatments to only service members with a service-connected illness or injury — fails to provide our military families with adequate access to care.”

“It’s about time we address this shortcoming so that our brave men and women in uniform do not have to juggle the out-of-pocket costs for treatment with their service, end their military careers to access health care, or forego their dreams of having a family,” Tipton said.

""The ‘Expanding Access to Fertility Care for Servicemembers and Dependents Act’ is a critical piece of legislation,” said Karla Torres, senior human rights counsel for the Center for Reproductive Rights. “By removing legal barriers that currently exclude from insurance coverage servicemembers whose infertility is not directly service-related, and safeguarding against discrimination in coverage of this care, the Act gets us closer to ensuring that all servicemembers and their dependents can have equitable and non-discriminatory access to the fertility health care they need to build their families.""",https://cdn3.creativecirclemedia.com/lafromboise/original/20250506-173323-208-strickland-home-mobile-hero.jpg,N,1.0,2025-05-07 10:56:45.449596

Adding to the company's troubles, this very TriCare payment issue has now become central to a recently announced class action lawsuit filed on behalf of Zynex investors. The lawsuit, Tuncel v.

Disappointing Q1 2025 Results Due to TriCare Suspension

On April 29, 2025, Zynex reported that its net revenue for the first quarter of 2025 plummeted to $26.6 million, a significant drop from the $46.5 million reported in the same period of 2024. The company also experienced a contraction in gross profit margin, falling to 69% in Q1 2025, compared to 80% in the prior year. The bottom line reflected these challenges, with an adjusted EBITDA loss of $11.8 million, a stark contrast to the $1.7 million in adjusted EBITDA recorded in the first quarter of 2024.

On the earnings call, Zynex CEO Thomas Sandgaard directly cited the TriCare payment suspension as a primary driver of the disappointing first-quarter results. He stated that the disruption significantly impacted revenue calculations and prompted the company to initiate a restructuring to prepare for a scenario where TriCare payments remain halted.

Looking ahead, Zynex has offered a muted revenue guidance of $27 million for the second quarter of 2025, with an anticipated EPS loss of $0.20. The company has withheld full-year guidance pending clarity on the TriCare situation, a decision that reflects the significant uncertainty surrounding this key payer relationship.

Analysts on the earnings call voiced concerns that the TriCare situation could create a domino effect, prompting other insurers to re-evaluate their reimbursement policies for Zynex's device.

Zynex Securities Class Action Alleges ""Oversupplying"" Scheme

The payment woes with Tricare appear to be intertwined with more serious allegations leveled against Zynex in a newly filed securities class action.

The core of the lawsuit's allegations mirrors the explanation provided by Zynex for its poor financial performance. Investors claim that the company misled them by failing to disclose practices that ultimately led to the TriCare payment suspension. Specifically, the lawsuit contends that Zynex shipped excessive amounts of products, including electrodes, inflating revenue and drawing scrutiny from insurers like TriCare. The plaintiffs argue that the company should have warned investors about the likely adverse consequences of these practices, including the potential for payment suspensions and removal from insurer networks.

The complaint highlights a more than 5% drop in Zynex's share price following a June 4, 2024 report by STAT detailing an alleged ""oversupplying scheme."" This report, according to the lawsuit, raised concerns about the company's billing practices and likely contributed to the increased scrutiny from payers like TriCare.

The lawsuit further points to a dramatic over 51% plunge in Zynex's share price on March 11, 2025, the day the company reported its disappointing fourth-quarter 2024 results and disclosed the significant TriCare payment suspension.

Hagens Berman's Investigation

Shareholder rights firm Hagens Berman is investigating the alleged claims. ""The significant revenue decline and the revised guidance following the TriCare payment suspension raise serious questions about the accuracy and timeliness of Zynex's prior statements to investors. We are investigating whether the company adequately disclosed the risks associated with its billing practices and its reliance on TriCare revenues,"" said Reed Kathrein, the Hagens Berman Partner leading the firm's probe.

“The high grade in safety reflects the entire organization’s commitment to providing the best care possible,” said Dr. Evan Renz, BAMC deputy commander for quality and safety.

“The high grade in safety reflects the entire organization’s commitment to providing the best care possible,” said Dr. Evan Renz, BAMC deputy commander for quality and safety. “Earning the ‘A’ means that the team maintained its clear focus on high-quality and safety over an extended period of time.”

The Leapfrog Group is a national, independent organization focused on health care quality. The organization evaluates hospitals on a wide range of safety measures, including errors, injuries, and infections.

Leapfrog assigns an “A,” “B,” “C,” “D” or “F” grade to general hospitals across the country based on over 30 performance measures reflecting errors, accidents, injuries and infections, as well as the systems hospitals have in place to prevent them.

A hospital must meet specific criteria to be eligible for participation in the Leapfrog safety assessment. In the Spring 2025 ratings, 32% of participating hospitals nationwide received the highest grade. Of the eligible military hospitals participating in the grading assessment, 16 received an “A” grade.

“The Leapfrog standards align with our commitment to the principles of Ready Reliable Care,” Renz said. “The distinction reflects not only hard work, but a longstanding culture demonstrated by thousands of BAMC staff members.”

Ready Reliable Care is the Defense Health Agency-led effort to advance high reliability across the Military Health System. Ready Reliable Care describes BAMC’s efforts to become a high reliability organization. An HRO strives for zero harm and remains committed to continuous learning and improvement, despite operating in complex or high-risk environments.

BAMC serves more than 250,000 military beneficiaries within San Antonio and the surrounding communities. On average there are about 236 inpatients daily.

“BAMC is committed to providing our patients the best quality and safest care possible and these results exemplify that commitment,” said Col. Kevin Kelly, BAMC commander. “We are very proud of this extraordinary accomplishment.”

The Leapfrog Hospital Safety Grade ratings are available to the public, making it easier for patients to understand the safety standards of their local health care facilities.
