,,2025-05-18 23:55:22+00:00,www.mondaq.com,A Lost Cause: Jury Finds CVS Caused The Submission Of False Claims By Subsidiary Omnicare,"Paula  Ramer, Paula Ramer, Laura Turner",,,,,https://www.mondaq.com/unitedstates/healthcare/1625518/a-lost-cause-jury-finds-cvs-caused-the-submission-of-false-claims-by-subsidiary-omnicare,"On April 29, 2025, a federal jury in the Southern District of New York found Omnicare liable for illegally dispensing drugs to elderly and disabled people in long-term care facilities without legitimate prescriptions.
In addition, the jury determined that Omnicare's parent company, CVS Health Corporation (CVS), which acquired Omnicare in 2015, caused the false claims to be submitted.
The government further alleged that CVS ""caused"" the claims to be submitted, as it was aware of deficiencies in Omnicare's practices but failed to correct them.
After the government rested its case, CVS filed a motion for a directed verdict, arguing that the government failed to satisfy its burden that CVS ""caused"" the false claims to be submitted.
Judge McMahon reserved judgment on the motion, finding that there was enough evidence for the jury to determine false claims liability for CVS.","On April 29, 2025, a federal jury in the Southern District of New York found Omnicare liable for illegally dispensing drugs to elderly and disabled people in long-term care facilities without legitimate prescriptions. A unanimous jury concluded that Omnicare, the largest long-term care pharmacy in the United States, fraudulently billed Medicare, Medicaid, and TRICARE, a government military healthcare program, for more than three million false claims totaling more than $135 million in damages — one of the largest jury verdicts ever in an FCA case. If trebled, damages could reach more than $400 million, plus penalties. In addition, the jury determined that Omnicare's parent company, CVS Health Corporation (CVS), which acquired Omnicare in 2015, caused the false claims to be submitted.

The relator, an Omnicare pharmacist, filed suit in 2015, and in 2019 the federal government, 29 states, and the District of Columbia intervened. The four-week jury trial began on April 1, 2025. The government alleged that Omnicare dispensed drugs to individuals in assisted living and other long-term residential facilities that were not supported by valid prescriptions under state law and then submitted claims for reimbursement for those prescriptions to the federal healthcare programs. The government further alleged that CVS ""caused"" the claims to be submitted, as it was aware of deficiencies in Omnicare's practices but failed to correct them. CVS focused its defense heavily on a materiality argument, arguing that the practice at issue was allowed by law in many states and accepted by the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services.

After the government rested its case, CVS filed a motion for a directed verdict, arguing that the government failed to satisfy its burden that CVS ""caused"" the false claims to be submitted. Judge McMahon reserved judgment on the motion, finding that there was enough evidence for the jury to determine false claims liability for CVS. Specifically, she found the evidence showed that CVS ""had ultimate oversight over Omnicare's compliance with Government program regulations — indeed, was required to do so by virtue of the [Corporate Integrity Agreement]"" that CVS had entered into in 2016 related to different conduct by Omnicare; and ""that [CVS] was aware of the compliance issues that underlie this case, and the fact that certain fixes had been proposed to remedy them"" but ""opted not to force [Omnicare] to adopt those fixes.""

The parties will submit briefing over the next month addressing the penalties to be assessed under the FCA, and CVS has said that it plans to appeal the decision. We at Qui Notes will continue to keep you updated on developments in the case.

I think the entire Reserve Retirement needs to be revamped for what we actually get after 20 years.

The Reserve Components are not what they used to be. It’s not BBQs and drinking on the weekends anymore. It’s high OPTEMPO with 29 days orders to JRTC/NTC and constant activations/deployments.

It’s time for the benefits to keep up with the current environmental/economic landscape.

You are a funny guy.

That’s true, but getting 100% is a battle in it of itself. I would rather just take the TRICARE immediately after 20 years and lock it in. Hell, I’ll even pay for it like I do already, just let me have it after I do the 20.

New York, New York--(Newsfile Corp. - May 17, 2025) - Faruqi & Faruqi, LLP, a leading national securities law firm, is investigating potential claims against Zynex, Inc. (""Zynex"" or the ""Company"") (NASDAQ: ZYXI) and reminds investors of the May 19, 2025 deadline to seek the role of lead plaintiff in a federal securities class action that has been filed against the Company.

Faruqi & Faruqi is a leading national securities law firm with offices in New York, Pennsylvania, California and Georgia. The firm has recovered hundreds of millions of dollars for investors since its founding in 1995. See www.faruqilaw.com.

As detailed below, the complaint alleges that the Company and its executives violated federal securities laws by making false and/or misleading statements and/or failing to disclose: (1) that Zynex shipped products, including electrodes, in excess of need; (2) that, as a result of this practice, the Company inflated its revenue; (3) that the Company's practice of filing false claims drew scrutiny from insurers, including Tricare; (4) that, as a result, it was reasonably likely that Zynex would face adverse consequences, including removal from insurer networks and penalties from the federal government; and (5) that, as a result of the foregoing, Defendants' positive statements about the Company's business, operations, and prospects were materially misleading and/or lacked a reasonable basis.

On June 4, 2024, medical journal STAT published a report on Zynex entitled ""How a device maker inundated pain patients with unwanted batteries and surprise bills."" The report claimed Zynex engaged in an ""oversupplying scheme"" by sending inordinate amounts of monthly supplies like electrode pads and batteries in order to ""bill insurers for thousands of dollars more than it otherwise could."" The report further revealed that, as a result of this practice, insurers were ""kicking the company out of network.""

On this news, Zynex's stock price fell $0.50 per share, or 5%, to close at $9.35 per share on June 4, 2024, on unusually heavy trading volume.

On March 11, 2025, after the market closed, Zynex reported its fourth quarter and full year 2024 financial results, revealing a significant revenue ""shortfall"" in the quarter ""due to slower than normal payments from certain payers."" Zynex further revealed ""Tricare has temporarily suspended payments as they review prior claims."" Tricare is the health insurance program for the U.S. military.

On this news, Zynex's stock price fell $3.59 per share, or 51.3%, to close at $3.41 per share on March 12, 2025, on unusually heavy trading volume.

The court-appointed lead plaintiff is the investor with the largest financial interest in the relief sought by the class who is adequate and typical of class members who directs and oversees the litigation on behalf of the putative class. Any member of the putative class may move the Court to serve as lead plaintiff through counsel of their choice, or may choose to do nothing and remain an absent class member. Your ability to share in any recovery is not affected by the decision to serve as a lead plaintiff or not.

Faruqi & Faruqi, LLP also encourages anyone with information regarding Zynex's conduct to contact the firm, including whistleblowers, former employees, shareholders and others.

Currently, Dr. Bono is the CEO of Medical iSight, a 3D imaging and guidance software company for intra-procedural navigational guidance. Previously, she was the chief health officer for Viking Cruises, establishing an industry-leading C-suite model that re-started and sustained the cruise line during the COVID-19 Global Pandemic. Before Viking, she was a gubernatorial appointee as the director of Washington State COVID-19 Health System Response Management, subsequently leading the state’s Pandemic Health Response.

She is a senior fellow with the Johns Hopkins University Applied Physics Laboratory. As the former chief executive officer (CEO) and director of the Defense Health Agency (DHA), Dr. Bono led a joint, integrated combat support agency that enabled all branches of the U.S. military—Army, Navy, Air Force and Marines —medical services to provide health care services to combatant commands. She integrated an unprecedented $50 billion worldwide health care enterprise composed of 50 hospitals and 300 clinical facilities that provide care to 9.5 million military beneficiaries; oversaw the Department of Defense (DoD) deployment of the electronic health record (EHR) system; and advanced the development of an integrated health system with the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs.

Dr. Bono’s leadership positions in the DoD include: CEO/director, DHA (2015-2019); CEO/director, National Capital Region Medical Directorate (2013-2015); acting commander, Joint Task Force (JTF), National Capital Region (2013); command surgeon, U.S. Pacific Command (2011-2013); chief of staff, TRICARE, DoD (2008-2010); commanding officer (CEO), Naval Hospital, Jacksonville, Florida (2005-2008); and was deployed to the first Gulf War as head of casualty receiving, Operations Desert Shield and Desert Storm (1990-1991).

She received her bachelor’s degree from the University of Texas, Austin, her Master of Business Administration from Washington State University, Spokane and her medical degree from Texas Tech Health Sciences Center, Lubbock. She completed her surgical internship and residency at the Naval Medical Center, Portsmouth, Virginia, and performed a trauma and critical care fellowship at the Eastern Virginia Graduate School of Medicine, Norfolk, Virginia.

“Dr. Bono is a pioneering leader in military medicine, a national healthcare strategist, and someone who has made a career of stepping up when the stakes are highest,” said Salus at Drexel president Michael H. Mittelman, OD ‘80, MBA, MBA FAAO, FACHE. “From the battlefield to the boardroom, from military hospitals to international business, Dr. Bono has consistently demonstrated what true leadership looks like—visionary, compassionate, and unflinching in the face of complexity.”

They are accused of running a pill mill that generated millions of dollars.

RELATED STORIES

Stephen Burklow has been monitored by the FDLE since 2013, long before his ownership of Pace Pharmacy. They say he had a ""continued pattern of questionable behavior throughout his pharmacy career.""

Stephen and Monique Burklow own Pace Pharmacy. Both are charged with conspiring to traffic prescription pills.

The FDLE says Stephen defrauded TRICARE -- a federal healthcare program for active and retired military members -- out of $30 million in just 10 months. That was in 2015 at ""Burklow Pharmacy.""

Stephen sold the pharmacy in 2016. That's when the new owner saw financial records that didn't add up. Stephen then went to work for Pace Pharmacy in 2017.

In 2020, authorities learned narcotics were sold without a prescription for cash through the back door and drive thru there. In 2021, investigators convinced an informant to go undercover and he purchased narcotics from Pace Pharmacy.

The informant secured hundreds of bottles of prescription drugs with labels saying they were dispensed by Stephen.

Pharmacist David Winkles worked at Pace Pharmacy. Investigators say he sold 20,000 oxycodone pills for $35 a pill to a single person every week. That would fetch him $70,000 every week.

When Stephen and Monique bought Pace Pharmacy in 2022, the previous owners had already noticed finances weren't adding up.

Investigators say Stephen sold codeine, Percocet, oxycodone and hydrocodone for cash. He is also believed to have made his own stronger version of oxycodone to sell, using pill pressers at home.

Authorities say Monique also sold prescriptions without authorization, some narcotics packaged and labeled as ""COVID-19 kits.""

Investigators believe the scheme used half a dozen doctors' identities that produced thousands of fraudulent prescriptions.

Stephen is also accused of laundering money through seven different banks.

Pace Pharmacy remains open. Apart-time pharmacist continues to fill prescriptions.

Hi Justine,

The Extremity Trauma and Amputation Center of Excellence, otherwise known as EACE, leads the advancement of extremity trauma-related research and clinical practice in the Military Health System—aiming to ensure a better future for those with extremity trauma. The center is run by the Defense Health Agency.

For answers, we turned to Andrea Crunkhorn, who applies her doctorate in physical therapy and status as the chief of clinical programs for EACE to support our injured warfighters and the clinicians who care for them. She had this to say.

EACE serves as the Defense Health Agency’s center of excellence for limb trauma and limb loss. We focus on the best-supported scientific and medical data and health care for service members and other Department of Defense community members with these injuries. We foster clinical practice and provide support tools to clinicians, patients, families, and caregivers. We help the clinicians who work with these patients be as efficient and effective as possible.

EACE assists our providers as they rehabilitate our wounded warriors and create a new normal for all patients with extremity trauma and amputation. Our specialists and staff work with the Department of Veterans Affairs to create internationally recognized clinical practice guidelines, so all limb rehabilitation follows the same best evidence.

The DOD and VA published the current upper limb amputation clinical practice guideline in 2022. These documents are regularly reviewed and updated to add new treatments and programs that improve patient care. DOD-VA published our revised clinical practice guideline for lower limb amputation rehabilitation in January 2025.

EACE offers every patient like your husband a guide called “Within Reach: The Journey After Upper Limb Amputation.” The guide provides information on coping skills, pain management, caring for your remaining limb, physical rehabilitation, and artificial limbs. The guide is available digitally on the EACE website under clinical affairs.

For soon-to-be parents, parents, families, and caregivers, we have a helpful handout, “Pregnancy, Childcare and Parenting after Upper Limb Amputation Rehabilitation.” It includes tips such as how to manage child care tasks.

The DOD Amputation Prosthetics Clearinghouse is a new portal for advice, discussion, and referral to one of the three Advanced Rehabilitation Centers in the DHA. The three ARCs are located at Walter Reed National Military Medical Center in Bethesda, Maryland, where I work; Brooke Army Medical Center in San Antonio, Texas; and Naval Medical Center San Diego, in San Diego, California.

These programs lead to advances in treating and restoring function after limb trauma and amputation. The centers are the only military hospitals that fabricate and modify artificial limbs. They also provide high-quality care from before surgery until you can return to your community.

You and your military hospital or clinic providers can reach out to me and my staff with questions at either of these emails: dha.ncr.Medical-Affairs.mbx.amputation-prosth-coe@health.mil. Additionally, phone numbers for contacts at each ARC are available on the fact sheets.

Other resources include the VA’s Amputation System of Care or its Polytrauma/TBI System of Care.

EACE also has information on surgeries such as directly attaching an artificial limb to the patient’s bone. This surgery can help patients who have difficulty tolerating a socket.

EACE focuses on research that can save injured limbs, avoid amputations, and preserve and restore injured limb function. We work to make our patients return to the highest possible level of physical, mental, and emotional function. Our warfighters deserve no less. We truly appreciate all that you do.

Justine,

As you can tell, you and your husband have a lot of support in this recovery. Stay safe out there.",https://dha.mil/-/media/Project/Images/News-Images/8763232.jpg,N,0.0,2025-05-17 12:56:42.262577

You probably will hit your catastrophic cap this year and have no more out of pocket costs for wife and baby.
Tricare select is still so much easier than dealing with tricare prime for spouses, so I’d recommend sticking with select vs prime for the family if you are using civilian healthcare providers.

The $660 is probably all of your copays totaled up for your wife and baby after tricare paid their portion. You probably will hit your catastrophic cap this year and have no more out of pocket costs for wife and baby. You should always view your EOB for tricare and compare it to the hospital bill just to make sure no errors were made, but you probably just had a lot of small copays add up to a large bill.

Tricare select is still so much easier than dealing with tricare prime for spouses, so I’d recommend sticking with select vs prime for the family if you are using civilian healthcare providers. I’m switching from prime to select once my husband’s current orders are up so I don’t have to deal with getting a referral for literally everything.

I would recommend calling Tricare (tbh, they’ve been insane on wait times tho. They messed up bad switching who covered claims, and haven’t been paying out their share to drs, to the point where some people lost providers (myself included) and asking what’s going on.

We are also select and about to hit our catastrophic cap, I was looking at the EOB on the Tricare website literally yesterday because I was adding up our costs (including prescriptions) for the year. Once you hit that cap, even cost shares should be covered (unless the dr is out of network).

This bill; one of the drs could have been out of network (you can always have that happen. A dr will work somewhere but that specific dr might not take insurance. Happened to me years ago, with an emergency surgery and insurance didn’t cover the anesthesia/doctor (not tricare)). I agree with whoever said get an itemized bill of charges, sometimes they’ll charge an insane amount for Tylenol or some OTC stuff. Or add in charges because people rarely ask for itemized, esp. if insurance is covering it all.

Also adding in, sometimes tricare isn’t caught up and will bill you. We’ve gotten refund checks (albeit, end of year) from Tricare in recent years because they charged, we paid, and had overpaid.

Best of luck to you, your spouse and the new baby! Congratulations!!

We are getting told the same cost-share BS from Tricare that our hospital “actually isn’t in network.” Our hospital is literally listed on Tricare’s website as being in-network. We have called the hospital and OB office multiple times and they have confirmed they are in-network, too. We’ve escalated our case pretty high up and are waiting to hear back. Aside from the deductible and copay, you shouldn’t have to pay anything else for your baby. We’re in the thick of it too. Just keep fighting! It absolutely sucks but it’s all you can do.

Definitely look at the EOB and see if it matches up. Take diligent notes every time you call Tricare. Get names, reference numbers, etc. And be prepared to get contradictory information depending on who takes your calls. Ask to speak to supervisors if at all possible. It is a full-time job battling them. And it especially sucks battling while having a newborn. It’s not right.",,N,0.0,2025-05-16 20:56:17.575757

NEW YORK, May 16, 2025 /PRNewswire/ -- Faruqi & Faruqi, LLP, a leading national securities law firm, is investigating potential claims against Zynex, Inc. (""Zynex"" or the ""Company"") (NASDAQ: ZYXI) and reminds investors of the May 19, 2025 deadline to seek the role of lead plaintiff in a federal securities class action that has been filed against the Company.

Faruqi & Faruqi is a leading national securities law firm with offices in New York, Pennsylvania, California and Georgia. The firm has recovered hundreds of millions of dollars for investors since its founding in 1995. See www.faruqilaw.com.

As detailed below, the complaint alleges that the Company and its executives violated federal securities laws by making false and/or misleading statements and/or failing to disclose: (1) that Zynex shipped products, including electrodes, in excess of need; (2) that, as a result of this practice, the Company inflated its revenue; (3) that the Company's practice of filing false claims drew scrutiny from insurers, including Tricare; (4) that, as a result, it was reasonably likely that Zynex would face adverse consequences, including removal from insurer networks and penalties from the federal government; and (5) that, as a result of the foregoing, Defendants' positive statements about the Company's business, operations, and prospects were materially misleading and/or lacked a reasonable basis.

On June 4, 2024, medical journal STAT published a report on Zynex entitled ""How a device maker inundated pain patients with unwanted batteries and surprise bills."" The report claimed Zynex engaged in an ""oversupplying scheme"" by sending inordinate amounts of monthly supplies like electrode pads and batteries in order to ""bill insurers for thousands of dollars more than it otherwise could."" The report further revealed that, as a result of this practice, insurers were ""kicking the company out of network.""

On this news, Zynex's stock price fell $0.50 per share, or 5%, to close at $9.35 per share on June 4, 2024, on unusually heavy trading volume.

On March 11, 2025, after the market closed, Zynex reported its fourth quarter and full year 2024 financial results, revealing a significant revenue ""shortfall"" in the quarter ""due to slower than normal payments from certain payers."" Zynex further revealed ""Tricare has temporarily suspended payments as they review prior claims."" Tricare is the health insurance program for the U.S. military.

On this news, Zynex's stock price fell $3.59 per share, or 51.3%, to close at $3.41 per share on March 12, 2025, on unusually heavy trading volume.

The court-appointed lead plaintiff is the investor with the largest financial interest in the relief sought by the class who is adequate and typical of class members who directs and oversees the litigation on behalf of the putative class. Any member of the putative class may move the Court to serve as lead plaintiff through counsel of their choice, or may choose to do nothing and remain an absent class member. Your ability to share in any recovery is not affected by the decision to serve as a lead plaintiff or not.

Faruqi & Faruqi, LLP also encourages anyone with information regarding Zynex's conduct to contact the firm, including whistleblowers, former employees, shareholders and others.

To learn more about the Zynex, Inc. class action, go to www.faruqilaw.com/ZYXI or call Faruqi & Faruqi partner Josh Wilson directly at 877-247-4292 or 212-983-9330 (Ext. 1310).

This is a success story.” That’s Dan Cnossen, a seven-time Paralympic medalist, former Navy SEAL and keynote speaker at the 2025 Military Health System Conference in Cleveland, Ohio.
“It’s steep, it’s too dark, it’s too rocky.
Speaking on how Ferrara saved his life, Cnossen said, “I owe him more than I can say.
Unparalleled Care, Perspective, and Focus Recalling his experience under the compassionate care of the doctors and nurses throughout the MHS, Cnossen wouldn’t have wanted to receive care anywhere else.","“Your mission is vital. I think you're going to see in my story that I'm alive here, up on this really high platform, because of the Military Health System. This is a success story.”

That’s Dan Cnossen, a seven-time Paralympic medalist, former Navy SEAL and keynote speaker at the 2025 Military Health System Conference in Cleveland, Ohio.

Cnossen delivered his powerful story of perseverance and overcoming extraordinary challenges to nearly 2,000 conference participants, inspiring the audience with his captivating ability to set goals and shift perspective—even when it feels impossible.

In September 2009, Cnossen led a platoon in Taliban-controlled Helmand Province in Afghanistan. As he and his team moved into position on top of a hill overlooking the platoon’s target compound, everything changed in a flash of an instant.

“We got to the designated point and proceeded up the hill. It was about a 20-minute walk. We got to the top. I remember taking a step, and cautiously taking another step. I paused. Next thing I know, I saw a flash of light under my goggles,” he said.

Cnossen stepped on an improvised explosive device. “I needed my teammates. I remember feeling a rising sense of internal panic. I couldn’t do anything,” he said.

The details, he recalls, are few and far between. “It’s steep, it’s too dark, it’s too rocky. I remember landing on sharp rocks. It was slow and damaging to my body. [My team] dragged me by shoulder straps, rocks cutting into my body like knives. The medic was telling me to stay awake. That was my personal fight. I lack the words to describe this experience in detail. But for my teammates, it’s very tiring to do a body drag. It’s like a 60-second sprint.”

‘I Owe Him More Than I can Say’

As his teammate dragged him down the hill and into a helicopter, Cnossen blacked out. Thanks to the fast action of his team in Helmand, Cnossen was airlifted to Kandahar where a team of U.S. military doctors were ready to act. One of those doctors was Dr. Stephen Ferrara, now the acting assistant secretary of defense for health affairs.

Eleven days later, Cnossen awoke from a medically induced coma at Bethesda Naval Hospital in Maryland, now known as Walter Reed National Military Medical Center. His legs were gone, but he was alive.

Speaking on how Ferrara saved his life, Cnossen said, “I owe him more than I can say. He could have gone anywhere in the world to serve, but he accepted the call to serve in Afghanistan.”

A National Hero

A testament to his character, Cnossen recalls the worst part of his experience. Even after losing his legs, shattering his pelvis, and enduring seven-to-10 hours of painful surgeries week after week throughout his two-year recovery, the worse thing, he said, was “dealing with lying in an ICU bed, stuck. The platoon is going to deploy. I’m not there to share the risk. I’m here in this bed and I cannot get out. That was corrosive.”

Cnossen’s inspirational character and commitment to his team and mission were not lost on Ferrara. “We have a national hero and all-around amazing person here. A true American hero in every sense of the word,” said Ferrara of Cnossen during his opening remarks at the conference.

Enduring two years of pain, rehabilitation, and emotional distress, Cnossen did not give up. He made a conscious effort to change his mindset and overcome what many would consider unbearable.

""There’s this notion of perspective,” he said. “The way you look at a moment, there are many angles to look at a scenario. Ultimately, I had to look at the totality of the situation. Challenge yourself—there’s at least one good thing to find. My arms could work. My legs were long enough for prosthetics. My limbs were long enough. Maybe, I’ll get to run. That’s another thing I can look forward to. That was motivating.”

Bringing humor to his story, Cnossen shared that, as a double leg amputee, he would finally be over six feet tall. “Humor can really help,” he said.

Unparalleled Care, Perspective, and Focus

Recalling his experience under the compassionate care of the doctors and nurses throughout the MHS, Cnossen wouldn’t have wanted to receive care anywhere else. “All this care I was getting, this is the best place to be. The prosthetics I’m going to get, they’re the best. There’s no better place to be in this condition,” he said.

By intentionally shifting his perspective and focus, Cnossen found a path forward, first in rehabilitation at WRNMMC and eventually as a Paralympic athlete representing Team USA. He shifted his focus from what was lost to what remained: his functioning arms, his gratitude, and his life. This generated psychological momentum, driving him toward recovery and eventually, athletic excellence.

He also focused on making small steps: getting out of bed, meeting visitors, getting his wheelchair and eventually prosthetics, and just making it through the day. This gave him renewed purpose.

“That bomb in Afghanistan took my legs. Ultimately, it had to be up to me if it would take my life,” he said.

Cnossen was awarded a Purple Heart and a Bronze Star with Valor from the Secretary of the Navy. He is currently training to compete with Team USA in the 2026 Paralympic Games.

His captivating speech kicked off the four-day annual MHS Conference, hosted by the Office of the Assistant Secretary of Defense for Health Affairs, which convened to share knowledge, advance innovation, and highlight new initiatives within the MHS. In his closing remarks on May 1, Dr. Ferrara emphasized the quality of the stories and information shared to improve the health care of the warfighter, saying the conference was “moving and inspiring, and helped bring us back to the center of what the nature of our mission is all about.”",https://d1ldvf68ux039x.cloudfront.net/thumbs/photos/2504/9004779/1000w_q95.jpg,N,1.0,2025-05-16 12:56:25.340847

Yea, dental and eye care are separate here in the US. Most insurance companies require you to sign up for each plan, separately, including tricare.

So one, make sure you’re enrolled!

Two, it should be easy to find care if you’re in a military town (town with a large base) as most places will advertise in large lettering TRICARE ACCEPTED on a sign outside their business. Otherwise going to MilConnect can help u find dentists that are in network. Also we just called down to the closest one (we can walk to it) and asked them if they took tricare. He’s been our dentist for years now. Millconnect will use your DEERS login. Calling the tricare west or tricare east line is also helpful as the wait isn’t long but I wouldn’t recommend them to find care. Only to change PCM. I find calling dentists and just asking to be the easiest. I used to work in medical reception and that was our most common call. If we took their insurance. So it’s completely normal and they’ll know the answer. And in the US, all insurance companies work with various practitioners so regardless of your insurance if you want them to cover you have to be seen “in-network” so practices are used to getting asked what insurance that take.

The overall DEFENDER 25 exercise is taking place across the European theater throughout the month of May and early June.

The focus of the medical portion of the exercise is to sustain a ready medical force that is prepared to provide resources forward into a theater of operation, manage the movement of wartime casualties to include military working dogs, manage the movement of blood products to forward areas and execute bed expansion requirements during the simulation of Large-Scale Combat Operations.

“Having a prepared and relevant medical force to deliver combat ready care is critical for success in Large-Scale Combat Operations,” said U.S. Army Brig. Gen. Roger Giraud, commander of Medical Readiness Command, Europe and command surgeon for U.S. Army Europe and Africa. “Their ability to rapidly deploy resources forward into the theater is paramount for immediate combat casualty care. Effective casualty management and evacuation ensures timely and appropriate treatment. Maintaining a reliable blood product supply chain to forward areas is vital for hemorrhage control and resuscitation. Furthermore, the capacity to execute rapid bed expansion during surges in casualties is essential to prevent overwhelming medical facilities. A ready and responsive medical force directly impacts survivability and mission success in a complex and demanding operating environment.”

DEFENDER 25 is the Army’s largest annual opportunity to exercise moving personnel and equipment into theater across modes for initial and follow-on operations critical to Large Scale Combat Operations.

Led by U.S. Army Europe and Africa, the exercise focuses on the strategic deployment of CONUS-based forces, employment of Army Prepositioned Stock and follow-on exercises demonstrating lethality and interoperability with Allies and partners.

The exercise is the largest annual U.S. Army deployment into the European Theater consisting of approximately 25,000 U.S Allied and Partner service members, 29 Allied and partner nations, 18 host nations, 14 different aerial ports of embarkation in the U.S., movement of 3,000 pieces of equipment and more than 5,000 U.S. based troops processed into the European Theater.

Also, as part of DEFENDER 25, the 68th Theater Medical Command provided command and control of approximately 500 Soldiers who participated in a field hospital exercise (HOSPEX) during Swift Response 25 at multiple locations in Lithuania during the month of May to train, rehearse, and build operational readiness. This event demonstrated the U.S. Army's ability to rapidly deploy U.S. based combat power in Europe, showcasing the command-and-control synchronization between U.S. and NATO forces.

HOSPEX units included the 519th Field Hospital, with U.S. Role 3, NATO Role 2 Enhanced capabilities, the 30th Medical Brigade, the 173rd Airborne Brigade Support Medical Company with Role 2 capabilities, 7384th Blood Support Detachment, and the 160th Forward Resuscitative Surgical Detachment.",https://api.army.mil/e2/c/images/2025/05/16/8eea356d/max1200.jpg,N,0.0,2025-05-16 06:56:24.578041
,,2025-05-16 10:02:56+00:00,CNN,Abrupt insurance changes rattle many military families and their medical providers - CNN,Ashley Killough,,,,,https://www.cnn.com/2025/05/16/us/tricare-military-health-insurance-problems,"Denise uses Tricare, a military program that provides health insurance for active-duty service members, National Guard members, and many retirees — like Denise.
This resulted in an avalanche of problems for both health care providers and patients, according to 37 providers and patients from 15 states who’ve shared their stories with CNN.
It also authorizes access to civilian networks of providers for those who need care outside of military hospitals or bases.
“It has changed the way that we deal with Tricare patients,” she said.
“Our priority is always TRICARE East Region beneficiaries and their ability to get access to care.","When Denise learned in February that she might have to pay out of pocket for her weekly therapy sessions, the military veteran from Virginia started to panic.

She’d been seeing her psychologist weekly in Norfolk for over a year and was finally making progress in resolving some buried trauma. Denise, who doesn’t want CNN to use her last name for privacy reasons, calls her therapist her “lifeline,” as she fears taking her own life if she can’t continue the care.

The therapist informed her that Denise’s insurance had stopped paying for her sessions. Denise uses Tricare, a military program that provides health insurance for active-duty service members, National Guard members, and many retirees — like Denise. It services about 9.5 million people.

Her therapist, flustered by the abrupt halt in reimbursements, said she sought to get payment for weeks — not only for Denise’s care but for all her other Tricare patients whose claims were suddenly going unprocessed as of January 1. Without success, she finally had to hold uncomfortable conversations, telling her patients in February that to stay afloat financially, she may need them to pay full price up front — or else pause their care until Tricare could start paying again.

“Panic. Absolute panic,” Denise told CNN, recalling how she felt when she heard the news. Her cost for therapy would increase from her copayment of $50 to roughly $200 per week if she had to pay out of pocket — a cost she couldn’t afford. “It scares me a lot. If I don’t have someone to lean on, it won’t end up well.”

Denise’s therapist, Dr. Libby Cutshall, has continued treating Denise for just the cost of her copayment. But she had to make the painful decision to pause care for about 30 other Tricare patients, as she couldn’t afford to stay in business without receiving reimbursement for their care.

Similar conversations happened in medical offices across the country when Tricare fell behind on reimbursing hordes of medical claims after major changes and technical glitches at the start of the year. This resulted in an avalanche of problems for both health care providers and patients, according to 37 providers and patients from 15 states who’ve shared their stories with CNN. They say those hit hardest were smaller outpatient clinics near military installations that operate on referrals and frequent appointments for mental health, speech therapy, physical therapy, and treatment for autism. For many, it’s caused life-altering financial stress and disruption in care.

Tricare is a complicated system, split between East and West regions, but it’s a mainstay for military families. It’s overseen by the Pentagon’s Defense Health Agency, and, like benefit packages at private companies, it offers various coverage plans for medical, dental, mental health, and prescription drugs. It also authorizes access to civilian networks of providers for those who need care outside of military hospitals or bases.

In the West, a new contractor, TriWest Healthcare Alliance, took over administering the health care program this year with its network of providers, adding to similar work it had done for the Department of Veterans Affairs. In the East, Humana Military continued the role it’s had as the region’s contractor for nearly 30 years but changed its claim processing partner. Six states moved from East to West, and the entire network had its annual Medicare rate update.

TriWest said some of the problems were caused by the previous contractor not sending provider information in a timely manner — a claim the previous contractor strongly denies. Humana Military said technical issues made it difficult to process claims, but those issues are now resolved and they’re working to clear the backlog.

Clinics in both regions reported missing reimbursements for months. In the West, many providers said they found themselves out of the network entirely in January and some are still trying to get recredentialed to return. Patients have had issues finding out if the same providers they saw last year are still in-network, or whether their appointments will be covered. Providers and patients alike have spent hours on the phone trying to get answers.

“It’s really halted my whole life,” said Shawn Manvell, the founder of Achievement Center for Therapy and owner of three large clinics — two in California and one in Nevada — that offer a wide range of therapies, with a special focus on treating people with autism. She said more than half of their patients come from Tricare families.

Manvell has received about $70,000 in reimbursement checks recently from TriWest, and another $100,000 in cash advancements that she’ll have to pay back. But she’s still owed an estimated $350,000, she said. To keep treating patients and employing her staff of nearly 30, she’s taken out $500,000 in high-interest loans, along with liquidating some of her own personal assets, she said.

Now five months into the year, progress has been made in both regions, but those who follow Tricare closely say the overall issues and their rippling effects still linger, creating trust issues with Tricare that could leave long-lasting ramifications.

Charlotte Cuestas, a 31-year-old military spouse in Florida, had been seeing a therapist for postpartum depression after a traumatic birth experience. She couldn’t afford the $200 per session out of pocket that her therapist was needing after lack of reimbursement from Humana Military, so Cuestas decided to suspend her sessions. “My fear is that it’s going to get to a point where no therapists are going to want to take Tricare at all because of this issue,” she said.

In several instances, providers near military bases who mostly serve Tricare beneficiaries say they have reduced the number of Tricare patients they’ll accept, have left the network entirely, or plan to close their practice — ultimately resulting in less access to care for active-duty military members, retirees, and their families.

Desperate for help, patients and providers made TikToks or took to military-centric Facebook and Reddit groups to post their experiences. Mission Alpha Advocacy, a non-profit group that focuses on military families with special needs, says it heard from nearly 400 providers who’ve reported insufficient payment and over 500 families who’ve reported disruption in care.

Tricare has gone through turnovers and other hiccups in the past, but this one stands out, said John Letaw, a former Navy lieutenant commander who spends his retirement days helping people navigate the system.

“What we’re seeing this time is way beyond. It’s really inexplicable,” he told CNN in April. Letaw has written a book, “The Ultimate Guide to TRICARE” and runs a Facebook group with nearly 20,000 members, where he’s seen stories of struggle from patients who say they’ve been affected this year.

“It’s pretty catastrophic to a lot of military families,” he said.

‘Domino effect’ leads to possible bankruptcy

Cutshall told CNN she continued treating four other Tricare patients, in addition to Denise, whom she described as her most vulnerable. She said she was too worried about the consequences if they had to suspend their sessions, and she feared they wouldn’t find care elsewhere amid the Tricare struggles.

“(Denise) is at risk for dying if she doesn’t have care. That’s not hyperbole,” Cutshall said of Denise. “She served in the military, and she should get that care — and she shouldn’t have to worry.”

Cutshall said she went nearly three months without receiving any reimbursement at her clinic near Naval Station Norfolk, the largest naval installation in the world. With 80% of her patients using the military benefit, her practice was hit hard by the disruption.

By her count, Cutshall said she’s still owed an estimated $30,000 by Tricare. She hasn’t paid herself at all this year, leaning entirely on her partner’s income at home, and she said she’s taken $20,000 from savings to help pay the three other therapists at her practice.

Since early April, with help from a Tricare representative, reimbursements have started trickling in for small amounts of $115 or $120 — a few as large as $600 — but the payments don’t explain which patients they cover, Cutshall said, so she has no way of reconciling her books.

She said she was getting five to 10 calls each day this spring from people seeking care — many of them active-duty military. But she’s had to turn them away, as she seeks to diversify and take clients who have other insurance coverage instead.

“It has changed the way that we deal with Tricare patients,” she said. “And that’s unfortunate because (they make up) so many people in our area, but we cannot continue to do this and sustain and help the people that we want to help.”

The gradual trickling in of reimbursement checks — one provider in Texas said one of her initial checks was for 63 cents — is a sign of progress for many, but it’s hardly relief for those who’ve been hit the hardest.

And for some, the lag in reimbursement has been completely insurmountable. On April 30, Elizabeth Brown-Miller closed her applied behavior analysis clinic for children with autism near Fort Cavazos in Texas. She said the “domino effect” created by a range of payment issues with TriWest this year was too crippling, and she’s now meeting with lawyers about possible bankruptcy and ways to avoid it.

“There’s no hope for us. There’s no way,” she said. “We have to shut down.”

When she opened the clinic in 2021, it was part of the East region with Humana Military. But Texas was one of the six states that migrated to the West this year, and while Brown-Miller’s clinic was still listed as in-network, her 16 therapists were suddenly out-of-network.

Billing became a nightmare, she said, and reimbursement payments weren’t coming through. She had to reduce pay for her therapists and cut back on services for her patients. To further maintain overhead and payroll, Brown-Miller said she took out $182,000 in high-interest loans, expecting the Tricare issues to be resolved soon. TriWest also sent her $70,000 in advance payments to help while they processed the backlog of her claims, she said, but she’ll have to pay that back.

In late April, after crunching the numbers, Brown-Miller decided she couldn’t sustain her business. She was in too much unexpected debt, a hole too deep to climb out.

“A lot of my parents (of patients) are angry. They’re upset. They’re sad. They’re grieving,” she said, growing emotional. “I feel like I failed them. And they tell me I didn’t. But at the end of the day, I did. Because I couldn’t keep my doors open for them.”

She said she reached out to 17 clinics in her area to see who was willing and financially able to take on her Tricare patients. Only four said they could.

Meanwhile, in the East, Natasha Lachapelle has been a speech therapist for 22 years and finally opened her own practice three years ago in the military town of Columbus, Georgia, near Fort Benning Army Base. About 95% of her patients used Tricare.

Six weeks into the new year, she emailed her clients to tell them that due to the lack of income from Tricare – she said she was owed thousands — she was cutting back her hours and taking a part-time position at a hospital instead. “It was an absolute cluster,” said Lachapelle.

As a small, solo practitioner who burned through her savings to deal with a cancer diagnosis last year, Lachapelle said she didn’t have enough money to keep afloat while she saw patients for free.

Humana Military had fully reimbursed her by mid-April, she said, but going months without payment and having to take on another part-time job simply became too much. She emailed her patients again on April 24, this time to say she was shutting down her practice by July, a decision she calls “excruciating.”

She said she feels so burned by Tricare that she can’t risk putting her financial future at stake.

“I can’t trust it,” she said. “I can’t trust it ever again.”

‘We apologize for the inconvenience’

In a message to beneficiaries on March 26, David Smith, the acting director of the Defense Health Agency, which oversees Tricare, acknowledged that the new contractors have “experienced challenges” since January 1 and that beneficiaries and providers “are understandably frustrated” by the delays in payment processing.

Smith wrote that initial technical problems have been addressed and “claims payments are now being processed closer to required standards.”

As of mid-May, Humana Military has adjudicated 6.25 million claims in the East, totaling $1.3 billion, with fewer than 7% of its claims pending beyond 60 days, according to DHA officials and a Humana Military spokesperson. Meanwhile, TriWest has processed and paid more than 7.3 million claims, totaling $1.5 billion, with about 2.6% of its claims outstanding beyond 60 days, according to TriWest.

“We take our commitment to TRICARE East Region beneficiaries and providers very seriously, and apologize for the inconvenience and frustration this problem has caused,” a Humana Military spokesperson said in a statement. “Our priority is always TRICARE East Region beneficiaries and their ability to get access to care. We are working closely with impacted providers to ensure they continue to care for TRICARE East Region beneficiaries.”

In the West, a spokesperson from TriWest said in a statement: “All major health care transitions of this size and scale bring challenges, and while we are currently processing and paying out claims to providers, we recognize that even one provider who has not been paid in a timely fashion is too many.”

TriWest said “it’s making progress every week” and continues to improve processing times. A TriWest spokesperson also said the company hired hundreds of additional customer service staff to handle the massive influx of calls and complaints and reduce the hold time. Both regions said they’re placing a special focus on clinics that treat patients with autism.

With so many providers showing up out-of-network in the West, Tricare and TriWest have sought to assure military families that they don’t need to wait for TriWest approval if they’ve been referred by their primary care manager — usually a physician on base — to see an outpatient provider. Tricare has issued a blanket waiver for patients to reference.

David J. McIntyre, Jr., the president and CEO of TriWest, issued a letter to providers on April 29, apologizing for any disruptions at their practices and reiterated that Tricare patients don’t need approval from TriWest if they’ve been referred for outpatient care at their clinics. McIntyre also addressed the issue of providers being out of network, saying, “Tricare patients may continue to seek care from their existing providers, regardless of whether the provider has joined the TriWest network.”

But patients say they run into providers who don’t trust the waiver. “The problem is medical specialists are reluctant to take those waivers because they’re still not sure that they’ll ever be paid,” said one retired Marine and combat veteran in California, who asked not to be named for fear of retaliation.

He said he’s lost more sleep trying to resolve questions about his wife’s care than he lost during combat. After getting a partial mastectomy last year to remove a breast lesion, his wife is scheduled for several follow-up appointments with a variety of doctors this year. Her mother died of breast cancer, so it’s a top-of-mind concern for him and his wife. But they can’t get solid assurances that their appointments will be covered.

“The continual non-answers … they start to dominate your thoughts, your feelings. It increases anxiety, puts you on edge,” he said. “It makes you question your own service and sacrifices that you made.”

In Missouri, Danielle Gist was in her first trimester when she learned her obstetrician was no longer in network when TriWest took over. A military spouse who uses Tricare, Gist was suddenly getting large bills that she normally doesn’t get for maternal care.

At an appointment this month, now in her third trimester, she learned her obstetrician was finally back in network. The news “felt like a bit of weight off the shoulders,” she said, but the stress and anxiety of trying to get answers over the past few months still leave her nervous.

“It still feels really uncertain,” she said. “And I still have all the other bills to reconcile, so it’s still looming over me. It just feels overwhelming and exhausting, like a job I didn’t sign up for.”

Christy Collins, a military spouse in Kansas, said Tricare has usually worked well for her family. But this year, she’s spent hours trying to get an appointment scheduled for her 8-year-old daughter to be tested for autism and trying to get ADHD medications renewed for her 12-year-old daughter. She’s also seeking a referral for a breast cancer screening for herself but said she keeps getting the runaround after making multiple phone calls.

“I have a PhD, and I can’t manage to solve this,” she said.","https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/8711554.jpg?c=16x9&q=w_800,c_fill",N,-1.0,2025-05-16 08:56:27.679381

Ever had one of those mornings where you’re half-awake and feeling every ounce of yesterday’s regrets? This is it. A young man—let’s call him James—wipes a trembling hand across his forehead, mind buzzing with what-ifs and a creeping sense of panic. Yet in that same hand rests a military ID and a TRICARE insurance card, like two small lifelines he’s not sure he deserves. But he dials the number anyway. Because sometimes, hope is a series of tiny steps.

On the other end of the call: Firm Foundation Treatment Center—a local, faith-centered drug rehab program that’s got him thinking, “Maybe I’m not as alone as I thought.”

Why TRICARE Is More Than Just Insurance

Once you realize TRICARE can cover major chunks of addiction treatment for veterans, military members, and their families, you start seeing how that little plastic card can offer something huge: a shot at real healing.

TRICARE drastically lowers the financial hurdle that often keeps people stuck in addiction. Instead of draining your life savings (or worse, dodging treatment entirely), you can tap into this coverage and focus on the actual work of recovery—therapy, community support, maybe even reconciling with loved ones. If you’ve got TRICARE, you’re already ahead of the game.

TRICARE isn’t just about a quick detox. In fact, it provides coverage for different levels of care—like partial hospitalization, outpatient therapy, counseling, and spiritual guidance. That’s like opening a door to a continuum of support that can see you through the tough times, from withdrawal symptoms to long-term relapse prevention. It’s not a magic wand, but it can be your safety net.

Levels of Care: from Intensive to Flexible

Healing from addiction isn’t about a single “aha!” moment. It’s a progression—a journey with setbacks, breakthroughs, and everything in between. That’s why Firm Foundation Treatment Center in Woodstock has multiple levels of care, all covered by TRICARE.

Partial Hospitalization Program (PHP)Welcome to a daytime world of structured therapy, skill-building, and group support, while you still get to sleep in your own bed (or a sober living facility) at night. Think of it like pressing pause on outside chaos to focus on healing. You’ll participate in group discussions about triggers, coping mechanisms, and your emotions. Afternoon one-on-one sessions might delve into underlying traumas. By evening, you’ll be back home or in a supportive living arrangement, reflecting on what you learned.

Intensive Outpatient Program (IOP)After you’ve tackled the core issues in PHP, IOP is the next step. You’ll still show up for therapy and group activities, but on a lighter schedule—maybe three days a week. There’s a bit more breathing room to start re-entering work or family life without losing the safety net of professional guidance.

Outpatient Program (OP)This is where you really test-drive the new normal. One or two days a week, you’ll drop in for check-ins and ongoing counseling. Some folks underestimate how vital these sessions can be. Having that consistent touchpoint keeps you honest about cravings, emotional swings, or daily pressures that could affect you. You’re busy rebuilding your life—that’s the focal point.

(Relapse? Yes, it’s possible. Sometimes it sneaks up on you. But even if you slip, Firm Foundation Treatment Center encourages stepping back into more intensive support until you’re stable again. No shame. Just keep going.)

Therapies That Actually Work

If you’ve ever wondered, “Can therapy really battle something as powerful as addiction?” you’re not alone. Addiction rewires the brain’s reward system. It hijacks your ability to feel normal pleasure without substances. That’s why Firm Foundation Treatment Center employs evidence-based strategies (all generally covered by TRICARE) that work to unscramble the chaos in your head:

Eye Movement Desensitization and Reprocessing (EMDR)EMDR might sound high-tech, but it’s surprisingly intuitive. You revisit painful memories (trauma that might be fueling your substance use) while following a therapist’s finger or another stimulus. Somehow—like a bizarre mental balancing act—your brain processes these memories in a less distressing way. It won’t erase the past, but it often takes away its power.

Trauma-Informed CareTrauma-informed means nobody’s going to shove you into a corner and demand you spill your darkest secrets right away. The entire clinical team acknowledges how trauma shapes your reactions, your trust issues, even your sense of safety. They create a supportive environment that respects your limits.

Hazelden-Based PsychoeducationKnowledge is power. These sessions help you understand why your brain craves substances, what triggers look like, and how you can outsmart them. It’s like a roadmap for your own mind.

Dual Diagnosis TreatmentStruggle with anxiety, depression, or PTSD on top of substance use? You’re not alone—lots of people do. The good news is, TRICARE covers co-occurring mental health disorders, so you won’t be referred out to some separate program. At Firm Foundation Treatment Center, you address both issues together, which is vital. Because you can’t truly fix one if the other’s screaming for attention.

The Faith Factor: Why a Men’s-Only, Christian Approach Matters

Sometimes, the spiritual dimension is the missing piece of the puzzle. Firm Foundation Treatment Center is Christian in its outlook, offering prayer circles, Bible-based teachings, and a men’s-only environment that feels more like a brotherhood than a clinical setting. For many, faith becomes this wellspring of hope—like a constant reminder that you’re more than your worst day.

You’ll find that staff simply encourage you to see faith as another tool in your arsenal. If it resonates, lean into it. If you have questions, bring them. It’s about feeling whole again, bridging the gap between mind, body, and spirit.

What Happens to the Family?

Addiction has a ripple effect. It hits parents, partners, siblings—everyone who cares about you. Firm Foundation Treatment Center understands that family healing is crucial. The treatment center offers family therapy sessions where loved ones can learn about boundaries, enabling behaviors, and practical ways to support (not sabotage) recovery.

Janey Macey, owner of Janey Macey and Associates, provides behavioral therapy to children on the autism spectrum — many of whom are from military families. Her clinic has long relied on payments from TRICARE, the military’s healthcare program. But in the first four months of 2025, she's not received any payments.

""TRICARE has always been a big part of our revenue, and it’s always been easy to work with,” Macey said. “Usually, we submit a claim and within two to three days we’re being paid. But that hasn’t happened this year.”

The issue began after Louisiana was moved from the TRICARE East region to TRICARE West in 2025. TRICARE West is managed by the TriWest Healthcare Alliance, and providers like Macey say the transition has caused major disruptions in payments and customer service.

""I joined a group of TriWest ABA providers on Facebook,” said Macey. “So many of them have had to shut down their doors, lay off staff, or turn TRICARE families away.”

When contacted by KTBS, the TriWest Healthcare Alliance acknowledged the problem in a statement:

“The challenges that Janey Macey is facing are unacceptable, and we are working to address them promptly. We are focusing our processing teams on outstanding ABA claims to help ensure no further payment delays to providers, or disruption of care to beneficiaries. We are also staffing up our dedicated customer service line with additional employees trained to address these challenges. This Autism Care Demonstration Customer Service line can be reached at 833-818-2525. Lastly, we are also reviewing escalations cases daily to help ensure providers experiencing financial distress receive advance payment.

We recognize that any provider who has not been paid in a timely fashion is one too many. We are deeply committed to the providers and military families in Shreveport and Barksdale Air Force Base. We won’t rest until our military community and network of providers experience the excellent standard of service TriWest is capable of and committed to delivering.”

The company also said it is increasing staff on its customer service lines to reduce wait times — a move that Macey hopes will allow her to spend more time with the children she serves.

Shortly after our interview with Macey, she received her first payment of the year.",https://bloximages.chicago2.vip.townnews.com/klax-tv.com/content/tncms/assets/v3/editorial/0/0c/00c8ece0-decf-55cd-8507-35735e50bd42/682649276addb.image.jpg?crop=751%2C394%2C0%2C53,N,0.0,2025-05-16 04:56:42.700560
