NMRTU Everett Laboratory submitted their ‘Lab Order Reference Guide’ presentation, with project lead HM2 Alessandra Vera explaining to the judging panel led by Capt.
David Tegtmeyer and Electronics Technician 1st Class Adam Phelps, ably assisted by all IMD staff members.
Maryn Holtslander and team members Lt. Hana Reichert and Hospitalman Gillian Searfoss.
Project lead was Hassett, with team members Tracy, Reichert, Cook, Gunderson, Holtslander, Burdick, Salcedo, Palad and Cmelo.","Advances in operational medicine for Navy Medicine and Defense Health Agency was on full display with the annual Continuous Process Improvement Fair held at Naval Hospital Bremerton, May 10-13, 2025.

The project presentation was based upon such criteria as innovative/creativity and overall impact on quality of care, patient safety and operational readiness.

“By continuously evaluating and refining our processes, we can reduce inefficiencies allowing more time for patient care and more time to utilize/improve the knowledge, skills, and abilities that make us a ready medical force,” said Lt. Cmdr. Ashley Gripe, Navy Medicine Readiness Training Unit Everett Physical Therapy Department head and Process Improvement Sciences lead. “By always looking at ways to improve, we are better able to provide the safe and quality healthcare that our service members need to ensure a medially ready force.”

The ‘Continuous Process Improvement’ concept is based upon the DHA Ready Reliable Care principle, which is focused on reducing unwarranted variation across the system, eliminating waste, and lowering costs.

“We recognize that Continuous Process Improvement is critical to what we do in Navy Medicine and in the fleet. By constantly analyzing and refining processes, we can adapt to changing demands, increase our patient satisfaction, and optimize our resource utilization,” Gripe said.

“This CPI Fair gives us an opportunity to highlight initiatives around the command,” continued Gripe. “Staff can demonstrate the improvements they are making to advance patient quality and safety. It helps to encourage a culture of High Reliability and Continuous Process Improvement that we strive for every day.

CPI initiatives included such ideas as implementing clinical improvements; developing strategic clinical partnerships; and improving and refining administrative and support processes.

“The submissions this year included projects from throughout the command including submissions from our branch clinics. They show the innovation and creativity that our staff utilizes every day to improve the care of our beneficiaries. The submissions demonstrated an impact on safety, quality, and readiness with controls to make sure they are able to sustain the benefits over time,” explained Gripe. “Some of the best ideas come from our civilian staff and corpsmen working day in and day out on the deck plates.”

Each of the 15 submissions presented a process to be improved, measurement on the improved process, analysis which tested any change(s) implemented, and more.

Navy Medicine Readiness Training Unit Everett Pharmacy presented their submission of ‘Pharmacy Designated Service Hours,’ how increased patient wait times can occur when pharmacy staff helping patients are pulled to perform other necessary tasks. Their goal indicated to create designated service hours to increase efficiency and reduce patient wait time by allowing pharmacy tasks to be done prior to assisting patients. Project lead was Lt. Julianne Hui, with team members Hospital Corpsman 2nd Class Brian Matthews, Hospital Corpsmen 3rd Class Isabelle Doyle and Micheala Martinez, Dr. Audra McCoy, Dr. Kathy Scott, Sonny Wilson, and Latoya Hall.

NMRTU Everett Laboratory submitted their ‘Lab Order Reference Guide’ presentation, with project lead HM2 Alessandra Vera explaining to the judging panel led by Capt. Kala Lepore, Naval Hospital Bremerton director and Navy Medicine Readiness Training Command Bremerton commanding officer, that ship providers homeported at Naval Station Everett were encountering challenges when they tried to place lab orders. Vera and her team members of HM2 Moncho Cabahug, HM2 Caleb MartinezSewell and Ms. Jezieca Cachero devised their project around distributing a lab order reference guide – with regular updates – to all providers on the waterfront to ensure a seamless and efficient ordering process for lab work.

After Hospitalman Olivia Blader Polzin of NHB’s Patient Administration noticed that there was unknown supply inventory with several departments which caused delays and missed items, she took it upon herself to develop an Excel spreadsheet to keep accurate records to minimize deficiencies, streamline ordering of actual needed supplies and increase productivity between the departments.

NHB’s Information Management Department had a vexing problem which they rectified as presented in ‘Asset Refresh,’ led by project leads Lt. j.g. David Tegtmeyer and Electronics Technician 1st Class Adam Phelps, ably assisted by all IMD staff members. They had approximately 800 pieces of equipment which had to be timely updated to meet the stringent requirements. Each item took nearly four hours to upgrade as required.

NHB’s Radiology Department presented their project, entitled “MOU for CT Training.’ The department has had CT imaging challenges due to manning challenges, caused by transfer and retirement. The department has proposed establishing a memorandum of understanding with local civilian hospital, St. Michael Medical Center, to authorize NHB radiologic technologists to obtain added training for CT, as well as other modalities such as MRI, ultrasound and mammography.

Lt. Essie Gutierrez represented the Directorate of Health Services Specialty Care Clinic presentation, ‘Utilization of Electronic Colonoscopy Teaching Video,’ which called for streamlining the delivery process of patient education instructions for colonoscopy teaching.

The Neurology Clinic, with project leads Lt. Cmdr. Margaret Mitzkewich and Lt. Justin Roelofs and team members Hospital Corpsman 1st Class William Brown and HM2 Kyle Champion, determined that they were retrieving approximately 16 vials per week of Botulinum from the inpatient pharmacy. Not a difficult task, but time consuming. Due to the constant need for refrigeration and inability to pick up in bulk, there was the continuous need to only pick up one order at a time. Until a properly suited refrigerator was identified and relocated in the clinic.

The Ophthalmology Department presented their ‘Ocular Triage and Challenges of Standardization’ submission, noting they had determined there was a lack of accurate ophthalmic triaging at the initial point of care, resulting in deferred patient referral and delays in care. Their goal was to standardize the triage process with initial [patient] presentation at primary and urgent care clinics, reduce time delays for urgent and emergent ophthalmology cases and reduce potential patient harm through delays in reporting for care. Project lead was Lt. Cmdr. Lan Nguyen assisted by team member HM2 Quinniece Mosley.

‘Project Pulmonary Expansion’ was presented by the Pulmonary Clinic with project lead HM1 Joseph Towery explaining that the clinic is not generating [enough] encounters relevant to patient populations and referrals. In order to improve access to care for all respiratory therapy patients within the service area and lower the task load of primary care, the clinic restructured referral management template to provide NHB as the top source for appointments by bringing back patients previously sent for care into the surrounding network and Madigan Army Medical Center.

Improving time management was key the ‘RFID Implementation in the Clinic Setting’ presentation by Family Medicine, led by project lead Lt. j.g. Maryn Holtslander and team members Lt. Hana Reichert and Hospitalman Gillian Searfoss. Their premise indicated a delay when transferring intake [information] from paper to the DoD’s electronic health record, MHS GENESIS, instead of directly documenting during the initial intake process. Eliminating the need for paper charting provides a number of time-saving advantages, especially giving the provider added triage time with the patient.

The Family Medicine presentation ‘On the Lookout’ used HEDIS (Healthcare Effectiveness Data and Information Set) to help identify patients due – or overdue – for preventive medicine measures such as colorectal screenings and mammograms, as well as address other delinquent measures including immunizations. The goal, established by project lead Terri Jandron, registered nurse, with team members registered nurses Ramir Salcedo, Farrah Palad and Devry Cmelo, Lt. Mikala Tracy, Lt. Christopher Gunderson, Lt. Olivia Cook, and Reichert, Lt. j.g. Wanda Burdick, Lt. j.g. Halle Hassett, and Holtslander, was to ensure providers and support staff are aware of screening needs and added orders placed while patients are present for scheduled appointments which can increase the number of patients completing their preventive health needs.

‘Teams Communication’ was the submission from Primary Care, with project lead Dr. Brandi Hommel and Reichert, aided by Family Medicine staff as team members. Their problem statement indicated challenges in communication amongst staff members was spreading in the clinic, specifically relating appointment delays between administrative receptionists and clinic support staff. They implemented the process of using Teams chat for all; nursing and support staff to help improve easier – and timely – communication.

NHB’s Informatics Steering Committee, charged with planning and implementing strategic informational technology initiatives, determined that the command did not have appointed peer experts for clinical areas, a Defense Health Agency requirement for all military treatment facilities. Their ‘Peer Expert Program,’ was led by project lead Reichert and team members Kelly Gann, Chris Rona, Kristina Sainz, Gunderson and Cmdr. J. M. Patton. A standardized program format was developed and peer experts within two clinical areas were put in place on a trial basis to determine knowledge and confidence with MHS GENESIS.

‘Utilizing Auto-Text’ from Family Medicine’s Primary Care Clinic, led by project lead HM3 Adam Redman and Holtslander, with team members Reichert and HN Anfernee Coleman, realized that their clinic relied upon in-between encounters with MHS GENESIS to communicate information regarding patient requests and staff member needs. There were times some information would be omitted, and written messages were a time-consuming process. The project goal was to streamline routine tasks through automation by implementing a standardized approach for all users.

The Family Medicine Clinic presented the ‘Purple Paper Project,’ stating that obstetrics referrals from their clinic to OB/GYN could be delayed due to a non-standardized process for ordering, verifying test results and timely entering appropriate referrals for network care.

Their goal is to create a standardized format for patients enrolled in the clinic, as well as those who present in NHB’s Urgent Care Clinic and request a pregnancy test. Project lead was Hassett, with team members Tracy, Reichert, Cook, Gunderson, Holtslander, Burdick, Salcedo, Palad and Cmelo.

Gripe attests that the benefits of encouraging such innovation and creativity in military medicine are manifold.

“Both our beneficiaries and our staff benefit from us sharing our process improvement ideas. The benefit however is not limited just to here. After the CPI Fair we will enter these projects into the Strategic Performance Improvement Data Repository which makes these improvement ideas available to all Department of Defense and the Defense Health Agency entities. The improvements that we make here has the potential to impact staff and patients across the world,” stated Gripe.",https://d1ldvf68ux039x.cloudfront.net/thumbs/photos/2503/8919769/1000w_q95.jpg,N,0.0,2025-03-17 12:50:35.328372

A number of my clients never access their MyMedicare account even though I tell them how to set it up and access it.

When a client asks why their claim was not paid I ask about the information from MyMedicare . . . they can't say.

I tell them THEY need to send me the MSN (which may not come in until months later, or go to their MyMedicare account and get the claim summary or call Medicare and ASK for the claim summary to be sent to them.

If a claim is not paid by Medicare there is a code attached to the denial. If the procedure is not covered, and they have not signed an ABN form, they aren't responsible for paying it.

I constantly drill into them, to never pay a claim until AFTER Medicare has adjudicated it.

But yet, many times they pay the first claim that comes in from the provider.

A few years ago Rachel got an outpatient claim from the hospital for $20k. The provider coded the claim correctly but someone at the hospital keyed in a code that was off by one digit. This caused the claim to be adjudicated as NC vs approved.

The provider called the hospital, explained the coding discrepancy, and the claim was paid in full (remaining 20% covered by the Medigap).

On another situation, Rachel had OP consult in Dec 2024 followed by surgery in January. The first bill we got was in early March for $14,000. The bill was never submitted to Medicare, they were billing us as ""self pay, no insurance"". After they submitted it to Medicare we owed $87 (the Part B deductible).

In the Army and Air Force, nearly 1,400 more soldiers and airmen work as surgical technicians.
“Some of the surgical techs here can be [asked] to serve in Djibouti or tasked out to certain hospitals that are critically undermanned.
“We are the fastest turnaround for refractive surgeries,” Mosley said.
Mosley’s duties include ordering specialty implants for surgeries, managing supplies and equipment, and overseeing other ophthalmology surgical techs and hospital corpsmen.","MARCH 16, 2025 – Peace through strength — one of the Defense Department’s basic tenets — is partially achieved through readiness. A ready, focused force isn’t possible without the crucial medical care offered to warfighters to ensure they’re equipped for any fight that might come.

Navy hospital corpsmen are critical components of military medicine, including as support for surgeons in various specialties. Corpsmen with the surgical tech specialty are considered the backbone of the departments in which they work, helping the Navy as it provides day-to-day medical support to sailors who often operate in far-flung locations.

According to a draft of the Medical Transparency Database from the Defense Health Agency, as of September 2024, there were about 830 hospital corpsmen with the surgical tech specialty in the Navy. In the Army and Air Force, nearly 1,400 more soldiers and airmen work as surgical technicians.

From assisting during surgeries to properly carrying out disinfection and sterilization processes, surgical techs are vital in fields ranging from dentistry and ear, nose and throat services to labor and delivery and ophthalmology. They go where they’re needed, whether it’s on a trauma team near a combat zone, on a humanitarian mission or at a military medical treatment facility.

“Some of the surgical techs here can be [asked] to serve in Djibouti or tasked out to certain hospitals that are critically undermanned. There’s a wide range of opportunities,” said Navy Petty Officer 2nd Class Quinn Mosley, the lead hospital corpsman and certified surgical technician at Naval Hospital Bremerton’s Ophthalmology Clinic and Refractive Surgery Center, Bremerton, Washington.

In 2023, Bremerton’s ophthalmology clinic handled more than 4,400 appointments for active-duty service members and other uniformed personnel. The refractive surgery center, which does corrective surgeries such as LASIK, brings in patients from across the Indo-Pacific, a region where the DOD is working to strengthen alliances against ever-increasing threats from China.

“We are the fastest turnaround for refractive surgeries,” Mosley said. “You will be seen 10 times faster [here than] anywhere else in the Navy.”

Improving Operational Readiness

Bremerton’s ophthalmology clinic emphasizes enhancing warfighters’ visual performance which means they strive to improve operational readiness by reducing the need for glasses and contact lenses. Service members can have nearsightedness, farsightedness and astigmatism corrected through PRK or LASIK surgery.

Mosley’s duties include ordering specialty implants for surgeries, managing supplies and equipment, and overseeing other ophthalmology surgical techs and hospital corpsmen. Any surgery is nerve-wracking, but especially those involving the eyes, so the surgical techs also help educate their patients on the procedures and what could potentially happen, as well as offer reassurances to calm them.

“I make sure I play a little bit of music for them in my office just to get them ‘zen’d’ out,” Mosley said.

Mosley’s job also includes traveling with patients if they need to be transferred. For example, she might go with a patient to Madigan Army Medical Center on Joint Base Lewis-McChord, Washington, about 45 minutes south, so the doctors performing the surgery have someone familiar with them.

Mosley said getting surgeries set up in a timely fashion in ophthalmology can be challenging, so when patients get the relief they’ve been seeking, it’s incredibly satisfying.

“That is the best part of my job — in real-time seeing how you’ve drastically changed someone’s life,” Mosley said. “I’ve had patients come back, and they’re just so thankful. They thank the entire staff, and they explain how their quality of life has drastically improved.”

Britain’s Draper, ranked 14th in the world, held his nerve to beat Alcaraz 6-1, 0-6, 6-4 and reach the first Masters 1000 final of his career.

Denmark’s Rune, ranked 13th, triumphed 7-5, 6-4 over world number six Daniil Medvedev — who had been runner-up to Alcaraz each of the past two years.

“This one hurts,” admitted Alcaraz, who was trying to join Roger Federer and Novak Djokovic as the only men to win three straight titles in the California desert.

“I don’t want to lose any match, but I think this one was even more special to me. It was difficult today, a lot of nerves in the match.”

Draper ended Alcaraz’s 16-match winning streak in the California desert, leaping out of the gate and wrapping up the first set in 23 minutes as Alcaraz failed to get to grips with the left-hander’s serve.

The second set was a mirror image of the first as Alcaraz found his range and after fending off a break point with a 137 mph ace in the opening game broke Draper three times to level the match.

“It was a strange match in all honesty,” Draper said. “Carlos came out a little flat, I sensed that. I had a chance in the first game of the second, and he came up with an ace …

“What happened to him happened to me, I got tight, I had low energy. I got lost out there for 25 minutes, but in the third, I was really proud of my competitiveness, my attitude and I somehow managed to get over the line.”

Draper, who lost a set to love for the first time in his career, broke Alcaraz for a 2-1 lead in the third in a game that featured a lengthy video review that showed the Briton had indeed managed to scoop back a winner off an Alcaraz drop shot without a double bounce.

Upon review umpire Mohamed Lahyani first called for the point to be replayed but then awarded it to Draper, ruling his “not up” call in the rally hadn’t hindered Alcaraz.

“Waiting for the ball reviews, they didn’t bother me at all,” Alcaraz said. “All I can say is Jack came, he played much better than me. That point didn’t affect my play at all.”

With momentum on his side, Draper broke again for 5-2 lead — Alcaraz failing to put away four game points.

Draper did show some nerves as he served for the match at 5-2 and was broken, abut steadied himself to seal the victory on his second opportunity.

Make it difficult

Rune executed a thoughtful game plan to perfection against Medvedev to snap a seven-match losing streak in semi-finals.

“It was to really play my game, come forward, take the ball on the rise,” Rune said of his strategy against a player known for his defense.

“If you hit hard to him, he likes the pace and he responds well to being in the defense and hitting strong back.

“So I tried to make it difficult for him. I tried to mix it up, making every shot that he has to play annoying for him. Slices, slow slices, some mixing the tempo, hitting hard on some, looping some.”

After an early exchange of breaks in the opening set, Rune managed to grind out a key hold for 4-4, saving one break point in a game that went to deuce six times and lasted nearly 11 minutes.

He broke for a 6-5 lead and pocketed the set when his rolling backhand drew another error from Medvedev, then rode an early break in the second set to victory.",https://media.breitbart.com/media/2025/03/wi/afp/britain-jack-draper-reacts-beating-time-defending-champion-carlos-alcaraz-semi-finals-at-indian-640x335.jpg,N,0.0,2025-03-15 22:50:20.360059

Back on track . . . from the linked article there may be some clues.

Tricare had retroactively denied 26 more claims for a total of about $3,000 worth of services it had already reimbursed providers for since 2019, when he first enrolled in Tricare For Life, a plan for Tricare-eligible people who have Medicare.

Harve has Medicare + TFL and has had both since 2019 (presumably when he turned 65). Medicare is supposed to be primary, TFL secondary. No word on whether the provider claims were properly filed with Medicare.

Tricare also reversed approvals for at least 10 claims, totaling about $100,400, for his wife, Janice, in the same time frame, while nine other claims that had once been marked as completed are being re-processed,

Janice is now 67, so has probably only been eligible for Medicare for 2 years . . . unless her MS triggered SSDI resulting in her possibly being Medicare eligible prior to 65.

Some MS therapies can run $60k to $90k per year.

Health Net Federal Services, the former contractor for the Tricare west region, also said it could not comment on specific cases, citing health privacy laws, but it said it is ""actively looking into the matter.""

TriWest Healthcare Alliance, which took over the contract this year, deferred comment to Health Net, which it said is responsible for processing and paying claims before Jan. 1. TriWest said it has not recouped or tried to recoup any payments from the Smiths and is not allowed to take such actions under its contract with the Defense Health Agency.

The plan administrator change didn't help.

Millions of service members, retirees, their families and network providers nationwide have felt cascading disruptions following Tricare's contract changes this year.

About 16,000 health care providers on the East Coast alone have not been paid this year, officials said, forcing many to drop Tricare patients, reduce their hours or consider closing their clinics. On the West Coast, federal officials said, beneficiaries are struggling with a host of issues, including long wait times at call centers and stalled referrals and authorizations.

Not good . . .

She said they called Tricare For Life, which is Tricare's Medicare program, but were redirected to at least three other numbers. When they finally reached a representative for the military's Defense Enrollment Eligibility Reporting System database, which holds information for every service member, Janice Smith said, they were told the officials had to manually fix her husband's records. The Smiths said database system did not elaborate on what was wrong with his records or what caused the apparent error. They were told to complete a Tricare form asking to reinstate their enrollment, even though they did not know whether they had been removed.

Makes you wonder why TriWest lost the contract. Perhaps they were always inept at record keeping. You gotta wonder what triggered an audit and recission on a $470 claim which seems to be the thing that started the snowball rolling.

Janice Smith said Tricare had initially approved her and her husband's services, which included brain scans to monitor her condition, hip replacement surgery, physical therapy and annual checkups.

This is very scary and doesn't speak well for TFL and their ""beneficiaries"".",,N,-1.0,2025-03-16 15:50:21.754677

TRICARE Provider Types

TRICARE defines a provider as a person, business, or institution that provides health care. Understanding the different TRICARE provider types will help you decide what type of TRICARE provider you want to be. At a minimum, all TRICARE providers must be authorized/certified under TRICARE Regulation and must have their authorization/certification status verified by the regional contractors in each region.

There are two types of TRICARE-authorized providers: Network and Non-Network Providers

Network Providers

If you decide to become a network provider, you will sign a contractual agreement with the regional contractor in your region. You will:

Agree to provide care to TRICARE beneficiaries at a negotiated rate.

Accept the beneficiaries' copayment or cost share as payment in full.

File claims with TRICARE for the remaining amount.

Non-Network Providers

If you don't want to sign a contract, you can be a non-network provider, but you must be certified by the regional contractor. As a non-network provider you can decide to be a ""participating provider"" or a ""non-participating provider.""

Participating providers agree to file claims for beneficiaries, to accept payment directly from TRICARE and to accept the TRICARE allowable charge as payment in full for their services.

Non-participating providers do not agree to accept the TRICARE allowable charge or file beneficiary claims.

Non-network providers can choose to participate on a claim-by-claim basis. You don't have to be participating or non-participating all of the time.",https://health.mil/-/media/Images/MHS/Photos/Default-MHS-Seal.png,N,0.0,2025-03-15 12:50:20.049678

Sadly, with a maintenance backlog now exceeding $10 billion across the MHS, Walter Reed isn’t the only at-risk facility.
Thanks to the tireless work of leadership and frontline staff, Walter Reed is once again operating at full capacity.
These funds will help ensure Walter Reed remains a premier medical institution for our Service members, veterans, and military families.
Health care is expensive, and we need to be judicious in our choices and hold ourselves accountable to the taxpayer.","The Military Health System (MHS) is the cornerstone of our military’s medical readiness, ensuring that our service members and their families receive the highest standard of care. In both war and peace, the MHS defends the nation against threats to our health, saves American lives, and restores our warfighters to duty – sometimes in the face of injuries that were once considered life-threatening or career-ending.

Many of our military’s medical facilities are world renowned, with care and medical research that rank among the best in the world. Recently, however, systemic challenges have emerged that threaten the effectiveness and reliability of the MHS.

I recently saw for myself the consequences of neglecting our medical infrastructure. In recent years, investments in the MHS went unfunded. The Obama and Biden administrations prioritized wokeness over readiness. This was done at the expense of our military families and combat readiness. I recently visited Walter Reed National Military Medical Center, where aging infrastructure and deferred maintenance due to chronic underfunding led to flooding. I saw for myself that this incident disrupted services and challenged our ability to rapidly mobilize to receive combat casualties. While facility repairs continue, the incident highlights broader vulnerabilities within the MHS – we have too much deferred maintenance and not enough medical personnel to meet the health care demand. Sadly, with a maintenance backlog now exceeding $10 billion across the MHS, Walter Reed isn’t the only at-risk facility.

Thanks to the tireless work of leadership and frontline staff, Walter Reed is once again operating at full capacity. I also directed millions of dollars be urgently applied to address both immediate repairs and long-term investments in the hospital’s infrastructure. These funds will help ensure Walter Reed remains a premier medical institution for our Service members, veterans, and military families. At a recent Fireside Chat with the Walter Reed team, I thanked them for their dedication and took questions, many of which contemplated the future of their medical center and of the Military Health System.

Our team also directed a 30-day assessment to ensure quality and safety across the enterprise, and system-level actions are underway to remedy the recent neglect and prevent similar incidents. Plans are in place to prioritize funding for critical maintenance and modernization projects, ensuring that our medical centers are equipped to provide uninterrupted, high-quality care. However, this is just the beginning of what must be a broader effort to modernize and secure the future of military healthcare.

Our service members deserve the best, and we must act now to deliver on the promise of a health system worthy of their service and sacrifice. Our Soldiers, Sailors, Marines, Airmen, and Guardians should not be waiting months for simple procedures. That takes them out of the fight. We have an obligation to provide them with world-class health care that is both convenient and accessible — keeping our fighting forces fit to deploy at a moment’s notice to defend our nation. Young men and women join the military and start military families because the Department of Defense promises to take care of them. Today, I’m sad to say, we have fallen short on that promise.

Recognizing the importance of the MHS to national security and the well-being of our Service members, Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth initiated comprehensive reforms to modernize and restore confidence. In his recent Message to the Force, Secretary Hegseth underscored the importance of rapidly fielding emerging technologies and reforming processes to enhance military capabilities. His commitment to modernizing infrastructure and adopting advanced technologies aligns with efforts to improve medical capabilities, like an increased focus on flexible virtual care to support Service members and their families at home and abroad. We must look at ways to simplify the TRICARE beneficiary experience and ensure that our military hospitals are meeting the pace of private-sector care in terms of access, quality, and experience.

We are also taking a step back to assess our medical personnel. Do we have the right staff? Do we have enough people in uniform? Is everyone in the right place? Do we have the right partners?

When Walter Reed experienced flooding, our exceptional teams worked closely across medical facilities within the National Capital Region, with other federal partners like the Veterans Administration, National Institutes of Health, and with the private-sector network in the area to ensure no patients had significant disruptions in care. Integration and partnerships were key to their rapid response, but this is not yet the norm across the Military Health System, and other facilities would not have had the partners to react as swiftly. A renewed focus on partnerships and resource allocation will lead to some hard decisions about who we work with and where we place our people to maximize every dollar spent, but it will also increase our effectiveness and stretch our dollars further. Health care is expensive, and we need to be judicious in our choices and hold ourselves accountable to the taxpayer.

This is not about simply fixing buildings and recruiting more medics — it’s about keeping our promise to those who serve. When you join the military, we promise you community, a mission, a sense of purpose, and that you and your family will be taken care of. If we fail in our mission, how can we expect you to succeed?

The path to reinvesting in the MHS is complex, but with steadfast commitment and decisive action, we will ensure that military medicine remains a pillar of strength in the United States for generations to come. The stakes are too high to accept the status quo — we owe it to our men and women in uniform to get this right.

(HNFS), a government contractor that provides TRICARE healthcare management services to active duty military members and their families. HNFS as well as its parent corporation Centene agreed to pay just over $11 million to resolve alleged false claims submitted to the U.S. Department of Defense.

While American values dictate that we thank service members for their role in protecting our freedoms, this government contractor instead chose to submit false claims in order to keep up their deal with the Department of Defense. Ultimately, it was taxpayers who footed the bill for fraud and false claims with government contractors. Taxpayers should never pay for shoddy services, especially not when it comes to healthcare and protecting personal and sensitive data relating to military members and their families.

The Allegations Against Health Net Federal Services, LLC and Centene Corporation

According to the DOJ, parent corporation Centene and its subsidiary Health Net Federal Services (HNFS) failed to meet these minimum cybersecurity protocols between the period of 2015 and 2018 while providing data management services to the U.S. Department of Defense through its administration of TRICARE. HNFS may have exposed U.S. service members’ personal and health data, as well as that of their families, due to failing to scan for known vulnerabilities and patching known security flaws. The networks and systems maintained by HNFS during this three year period were reported by third party security auditors as well as the company’s own internal audit department for being inadequate in terms of:

Asset management

Access controls

Flawed configuration settings

Weak firewalls or lack of firewalls in use

End-of-life hardware and software in place

Lack of patch management

Vulnerability scanning

Shoddy password policies

HFNS not only allegedly failed to install updates from vendors that would have countered known threats; they also allegedly falsely certified compliance with annual reports to DHA in order to keep their government contract with TRICARE. In order to resolve these allegations, the company Centene Corporation, which acquired all shares of HFNS as well as its liabilities, has agreed to pay $11,253,400. The matter was resolved in collaboration with the U.S. Department of Justice Civil Division’s Commercial Litigation Branch (Fraud Section) and the U.S. Attorney’s Office for the Eastern District of California, as well as with assistance from the DoD Office of Inspector General, the DCIS, Cyber Field Office Western Region, the Inspector General’s Office of Audits, Cyberspace Operations Directorate, and the DoD’s Defense Contract Management Agency, Defense Industrial Base Cybersecurity Assessment Center.

What Is TRICARE?

TRICARE is a federal health insurance program administered by the U.S. Department of Defense and its contracts. TRICARE provides healthcare coverage to qualifying members of the U.S. military and their families, including:

Active duty service members and their families

National Guard and Reserve members and families

Medal of Honor recipients and their families

Survivors

Children

Former spouses

TRICARE is similar to Medicare in that it is a primary health insurance provider funded by taxpayer dollars and administered by a federal agency. While Medicare covers older Americans ages 65 and up, TRICARE provides medical, dental, and pharmacy coverage for U.S. military members, veterans, and family members. Because of this, TRICARE also maintains personal and sensitive data for military members, including some confidential location information for active duty personnel. Like all health data, TRICARE records include HIPAA-protected information and other confidential information, which can be exposed to data breaches by criminal hackers and contractors who do not take their cybersecurity obligations seriously. TRICARE breaches are especially troubling because they can lead to the unlawful dissemination of protected information that compromises individual health privacy and potentially national security.

Federal Healthcare Programs Are Vulnerable to Cybersecurity Breaches

Acting U.S. Attorney Michele Beckwith for the Eastern District of California spoke about the HNFS settlement, saying “Safeguarding sensitive government information, particularly when it relates to the health and well-being of millions of service members and their families, is of paramount importance. When HNFS failed to uphold its cybersecurity obligations, it didn’t just breach its contract with the government, it breached its duty to the people who sacrifice so much in defense of our nation.”

Both healthcare and defense spending for government contracts are two of the most at-risk areas for fraud, waste, and abuse. Taxpayers lose billions of dollars every year to government contractors and healthcare organizations that take advantage of federal healthcare programs like Medicare, Medicaid, and TRICARE, with an estimated 10% of program expenses at risk. Meanwhile, the Government Accountability Office reports that the U.S. Department of Defense is particularly vulnerable to false or fraudulent claims involving overbilling, billing for work never performed or services not rendered to beneficiaries, fraudulent bid submissions, non-competitive bids, the provisions of substandard parts or services, and the failure to disclose data breaches and other cybersecurity risks.

How Whistleblowers Can Protect Americans Through the False Claims Act

Under the U.S. Department of Justice’s Civil Cyber Fraud Initiative, private companies that contract with the federal government are obligated to uphold certain minimum cybersecurity standards. When they fail to do so, or falsely certify compliance with cybersecurity requirements, they can be held accountable under the False Claims Act for treble damages and penalties to the federal government. Through a qui tam lawsuit, whistleblowers who report on these kinds of violations can also receive a percentage of the government’s total recovery. These percentages can range from 10% to 30% of the final settlement. The False Claims Act imposes treble damages upon violators, as well as individual penalties for each false claims of up to $13,946 to $27,894 per violation. The law also allows whistleblowers (known as relators) who meet certain eligibility requirements and are the first to report cybersecurity fraud, government contractor fraud including DOD fraud, or healthcare fraud a reward for their inside information.

Whistleblowers can come from all walks of life and may include current or former employees of any potential defendant such as employees of government contractors, health care entities, or any regulated company, non-employees (examiners, competitors, clients, customers, auditors, reviewers, consultants, industry experts), anyone with evidence and knowledge of fraud involving government money. As long as you come forward willingly and in a timely manner you may be able to bring a qui tam case with the help of a qui tam lawyer and recover a reward. There are also additional protections for employees, including cybersecurity professionals, who speak up. These may include:",https://natlawreview.com/sites/default/files/styles/article_image/public/2025-03/cybersecurity%20computer%20online%20Isometric%20Data%20Security-421857590.jpg?h=79ff953a&itok=Uty3WxBS,N,-1.0,2025-03-14 19:50:19.996922

Christopher Kyle Johnston, 46, of Baton Rouge, Louisiana and Trent Brockmeier, 62, of The Villages, Florida, were convicted on March 10, 2025 of one count of conspiracy to commit wire fraud and health care fraud, one count of conspiring to commit identity theft by fraudulently using a means of identification, and one count of conspiracy to commit money laundering by transacting in criminal proceeds following a six-week trial before U.S. District Judge Edward S. Kiel.

According to documents filed in this case and the evidence at trial:

Central Rexall Drugs was a pharmacy in Louisiana that prepared compounded medications, which are specialty medications mixed by a pharmacist to meet the specific medical needs of an individual patient. In 2013, Johnston and Brockmeier entered into an agreement to take over the management of the pharmacy and expand the compounding business in exchange for 90 percent of the profits. Brockmeier became chief operating officer of Central Rexall and Johnston became general counsel.

Johnston and Brockmeier learned that certain insurance plans would reimburse thousands of dollars for a one-month supply of certain compounded medications – including pain, scar, and antifungal creams, as well as vitamin combinations. The health plans for New Jersey state and local government and education employees, including teachers, firefighters, municipal police officers, and state troopers, covered these medications, as did TRICARE, which insures current and former members of the U.S. military and their families.

Johnston and Brockmeier designed compounded medications and manipulated the ingredients in the medications in order to obtain high insurance reimbursements rather than serve the medical needs of patients. To determine which ingredients and combinations resulted in high insurance reimbursements, Johnston and Brockmeier directed Central Rexall employees to submit false prescription claims to test out different combinations of ingredients, but they did not have a valid prescription signed by a doctor for these formulas. Central Rexall submitted these false claims using, without their consent, individuals’ names, dates of birth, and identifying information (including insurance information) from pre-existing Central Rexall prescriptions.

By use of these false claims, Johnston and Brockmeier designed compounded medications with combinations of ingredients that were chosen solely based on the amount of money that insurance would pay rather than on the medications’ ability to serve the medical needs of patients.

Johnston and Brockmeier retained and directed an outside sales force that used various methods to get doctors to prescribe these medications and patients to accept them, including having prescriptions signed without the patient seeing a doctor or knowing about the medications, having medications or refills ordered without the patients’ knowledge, paying patients to accept the medications, and paying doctors to prescribe them.

Johnston and Brockmeier caused approximately $100 million in fraudulent insurance claims for compounded medications that were not medically necessary. Johnston received approximately $34 million and Brockmeier received approximately $5 million in illicit profits.

50 people have been convicted or pled guilty in the overarching conspiracy.

The health care fraud and wire fraud conspiracy count carries a maximum potential penalty of 20 years in prison and a $250,000 fine, or twice the gain or loss from the offense. The conspiracy to commit identity theft count carries a maximum penalty of five years in prison and a $250,000 fine, or twice the gross gain or loss from the offense. The conspiracy to commit money laundering charge carries a maximum term of imprisonment of 10 years and a fine of $250,000 or twice the gross gain or loss from the offense or not more than twice the amount of the criminally derived property involved in the transactions. Sentencing is scheduled for July 21, 2025.

U.S. Attorney John Giordano credited special agents of the FBI’s Atlantic City Resident Agency, under the direction of Acting Special Agent in Charge Terence G. Reilly in Newark; special agents of IRS - Criminal Investigation, under the direction of Special Agent in Charge Tammy Tomlins in Newark; and the U.S. Department of Labor, Office of Inspector General, Northeast Region, under the direction of Special Agent in Charge Jonathan Mellone, with the investigation leading to today’s conviction.

The government is represented by Assistant U.S. Attorneys R. David Walk, Jr. and Daniel A. Friedman of the Criminal Division.

This blood drive was “the type of drive that sustains the donor pool,” said Maj. Laze Stewart, chief of the ASBBC – PNW.
The ASBBC – PNW’s goal is to “host three to four blood drives per week on JBLM to ensure the Armed Services Blood Program and contingency shelf quota is met,” according to the organization.
Shankle’s unit, 1-51 ADA, was the top battalion/squadron represented at the blood drive, where it received 67 FOFS points.

Frank Wake, a medical lab technician with about 30 years of experience, joked with Spc. Cody Shankle, 1st Battalion, 51st Regiment, 1st Multi-Domain Task Force at Joint Base Lewis-McChord, making him laugh despite just sticking him with a needle.

Wake helped collect Shankle’s blood March 6 at a blood drive at JBLM’s Soldiers Field House. Two more drives are planned for next month, including April 14 at Wilson Fitness Center and April 15 at McChord Fitness Center. Both will be held from 9 a.m. to 2 p.m.

A joint effort between JBLM's Armed Services Blood Bank Center – Pacific Northwest and Morale, Welfare and Recreation, the event brought in 113 registered donors and 88 good units of blood, said Emery Brake, public affairs, blood donor recruiter for the ASBBC – PNW, part of the Armed Services Blood Program.

The ASBP’s mission is “to provide quality blood products and services for all worldwide customers in peace and war,” and its requirements are to support combatant commands, Defense Health Agency medical treatment facilities and contingency blood for rapid deployments, according to ASBP data.

This blood drive was “the type of drive that sustains the donor pool,” said Maj. Laze Stewart, chief of the ASBBC – PNW.

However, more blood donations are still needed.

“The ASBBC-PNW has experienced a decrease in donations and is working toward meeting weekly quota requirements,” Brake said.

Service members face competing interests, including their hometown donation centers and other off-base centers that pay donors. The ASBBC – PNW tries to help people understand that the units of blood they collect “stay in-house, so to speak,” or stay within the armed services, Stewart said.

“To meet our quota requirements, we need to collect at minimum 150 donors a week, which would be around 550 donors a month,” according to a recent ASBBC – PNW command briefing slide. “Currently, we have very few months where we are hitting 500-plus donors. Until we achieve the Army Quota Mission each week and have excess, our support to Madigan (Army Medical Center) will not improve. Our priority is supplying our combatant commands who cannot source blood locally.”

Madigan is considered an ASBBC – PNW primary customer because of its level two trauma center status, “heavy schedule of routine surgeries and births” and anemia and cancer clinics, Stewart said.

The ASBBC – PNW’s goal is to “host three to four blood drives per week on JBLM to ensure the Armed Services Blood Program and contingency shelf quota is met,” according to the organization.

“That’s us shooting for a typical drive to be between 40 and 50 people,” Stewart said. “The reality is the turnout’s just not always what it should be.”

According to an ASBBC – PNW donor pamphlet, “almost 40% of the U.S. population is eligible to donate. Only 5% do.”

But March 6, MWR at JBLM applied a competitive angle to the blood drive “that just brought them out in droves,” Stewart said.

Participants earned double Fields of Friendly Strife points for their units, and the same rule will be applied at the April 14 and 15 drives. FOFS events give active-duty service members and their families the opportunity to gain points for their units. The winning unit receives the FOFS Commander’s Cup at the end of the competition year. The competition is broken down into two divisions: Brigade/Group and Battalion/Squadron.

Shankle’s unit, 1-51 ADA, was the top battalion/squadron represented at the blood drive, where it received 67 FOFS points. The top brigade/group was the 1st MDTF with 81 points, Brake said.

Wake, a pending retiree, loves talking with service members at the events.

“The time spent with these guys is the best,” he said while working with Shankle. “They come in with giant hearts.”

And they did.

“I just like to give back and I just want to see what I can do to help,” Shankle said.

Private First Class Shana Malauulu, 1-51 ADA, donated blood for the first time.

“It’s going pretty well. I was nervous, but I think it’s pretty fast and easy,” she said. “I just wanted to help anyone that needed blood that had the same blood type as me.”

Army spouse and Rainier Inn Operations manager Lizzie Woods was another donor, participating with additional IHG Hotels staff members.

“Giving blood is a great cause,” she said. “I’ve done it my whole life.”

Specialist Michael Stutzman, 4th Battalion, 23rd Infantry Regiment, 2nd Brigade, 2nd Infantry Division, said he had “plenty to give.”

“It’s just a couple hours out of your day that could possibly save someone’s life, so why not?” he said.

Volunteers within the military community, including service members, their family members, Department of Defense civilians, federal employees and contractors can donate to the ASBBC – PNW. The mobile team will travel to units to host blood drives, and donation appointments are also available at the organization’s on-base location, 9904 E. Johnson St., on Lewis Main. Potential donors are asked to call the ASBBC – PNW at 253-968-1850 and leave a voice message to schedule an appointment; they will be called back to confirm.

Donors must be 17 and older and weigh at least 116 pounds to donate whole blood, although 16-year-olds are able to donate with parental consent, according to an ASBP donor pre-screening guide.
