Once a service member leaves active duty, reserve, or national guard status, their service isn't always over. Many veterans have to work with the Veteran Affairs to get benefits they earned during their service. By being more active in everyday politics, the veteran community can begin to pressure Congress to focus on providing both new and old veterans with the benefits they deserve.

Select vs prime is more of a your preference thing. Network and coverage is all the same. It just ultimately cost you less on Prime with PCM/managed care vs Select where you can pretty much do what you want with covered items without dealing with a PCM.

Prime vs USFHP...this comes down to which has the better network in the area you live, or if establishments you prefer to use are in one network but not the other. Otherwise, coverages, costs, etc are the same.

Personally as AD retired I am on Prime. I'm about 200mi from the nearest MTF so everything is 100% regular local stuff, PCM and all, and nothing military related. It's worked out great. I had looked at random stuff that is in network between Tricare and USFHP, and for my area Tricare had the better network. That said, I am in one of those areas that changed from Tricare east to west this year. With that change, many Drs and places that were in network are now not, so far anyways. I stuck with Prime this year as maybe just some time is needed before everything is converted and hashed back out...but if things remain the same come renewal time again, I'll be switching to USFHP as that network would be better than how Tricare is sitting currently in my area.",,N,0.0,2025-05-04 15:56:28.501723

“After assessing the current state of referrals, DHA has decided to extend the referral approval waiver for many beneficiaries,” said Richard Hart, Division Chief, Health Plan Design, TRICARE Health Plan, at the Defense Health Agency.
These fees are waived for existing referrals with non-network providers in the West Region.)

Visit TRICARE West Region Transition.","Do you live in the West Region? Do you have TRICARE Prime? You should know that the Defense Health Agency has extended the West Region referral approval waiver through June 30. TRICARE-authorized specialty care providers don’t need to wait for TriWest Healthcare Alliance to approve referrals issued by your primary care manager before providing outpatient care.

“After assessing the current state of referrals, DHA has decided to extend the referral approval waiver for many beneficiaries,” said Richard Hart, Division Chief, Health Plan Design, TRICARE Health Plan, at the Defense Health Agency. “This waiver extension will ensure that West Region beneficiaries can continue getting specialty care without interruption to their care.”

However, certain military hospitals and clinics have returned to normal referral processing. This phased approach is enabling TriWest to improve its referral processing system. If your PCM is located at one these facilities, TriWest will process your referral. Keep reading to learn more.

How does the waiver work?

Through June 30, keep following the rules of your TRICARE Prime plan. These rules are described in the TRICARE Choices in the United States Handbook.

Continue seeing your PCM to get referrals for specialty care, even if your PCM isn’t currently in TriWest’s network. (Note: The point-of-service fee waiver is also extended through Sept. 30. These fees are waived for existing referrals with non-network providers in the West Region.)

During the waiver period, you don’t need to wait for TriWest to approve your referral (unless your PCM is at certain military hospitals or clinics). However, the specialist you see must be TRICARE-authorized.

Here are a few key things to remember:

Ask your PCM for a copy of your referral. Is your PCM at a military hospital or clinic? They may send it:

Through the MHS GENESIS Patient Portal within 3-5 days

In the mail within 3-5 days

To a referral customer service office. You can pick up your copy after your appointment.

When you see your specialist, bring the copy of your referral, dated Jan. 1 through June 30. You can also bring a copy of the TRICARE West Region Referral Approval Waiver Letter. This is available on www.tricare.mil/west.

Not sure how to find a specialist? You can:

Ask your PCM to recommend a local TRICARE-authorized specialist.

See a specialist you’ve seen before, if they’re TRICARE-authorized.

Search TriWest’s provider directory to find specialists in your area.

Are there exceptions to the waiver?

This waiver never applies to:

Inpatient care

Applied behavior analysis or Autism Care Demonstration services

Laboratory developed tests

Extended Care Health Option services

Certain military hospitals and clinics in the West Region have returned to normal referral processing. If your PCM is located at one of these facilities, they’ll let you know. They’ll send your referral to TriWest for processing.

If this applies to you:

Access your approved referral through TriWest’s secure portal. You can also wait to get it in the mail.

Your TriWest portal will have instructions on how to schedule an appointment with the assigned specialist. If there’s a problem or you have questions, call TriWest at 888-TRIWEST (874-9378).

In conclusion, Amwell’s earnings call reflected a positive sentiment with strong software revenue growth and improved financial metrics.","American Well Corporation ((AMWL)) has held its Q1 earnings call. Read on for the main highlights of the call.

During the recent earnings call, American Well Corporation, also known as Amwell, conveyed a generally positive sentiment despite some challenges. The company reported strong software revenue growth and an improved adjusted EBITDA, driven by strategic deployments such as the Military Health System. While there were some hurdles like delayed deployments and lower visit volumes, the overall outlook remains optimistic with promising prospects for future growth and positive cash flow.

Strong Software Revenue Growth

Amwell’s software revenue experienced a significant increase, growing over 30% from the first quarter of the previous year. This growth was largely attributed to strategic client deployments, including the implementation of the Military Health System, which has been a key driver of this success.

Improved Adjusted EBITDA

The company reported an improvement in adjusted EBITDA for the fourth consecutive quarter. The loss narrowed to $12.2 million, a substantial improvement from the $45.6 million loss reported in the first quarter of 2024, showcasing the company’s efforts in enhancing its financial performance.

Partnership with Military Health System

Amwell’s platform is now operational for scheduled visits across the global Military Health System. This deployment has been met with high satisfaction rates from both patients and providers, exceeding 90%, highlighting the effectiveness and acceptance of Amwell’s solutions.

Positive Cash Flow Prospects

The company is on a path to achieving positive cash flow from operations by 2026. This goal is supported by cost reduction measures and an improved revenue mix, which are expected to drive financial stability and growth.

Delayed Deployment Due to Leadership Transition

The deployment of automated and Digital Behavioral Health programs has been delayed to the third quarter, pending final confirmation from the new Director of the Defense Health Agency. This leadership transition has temporarily impacted the company’s deployment timeline.

Lower Visit Volumes

Amwell completed approximately 1.3 million visits in the first quarter, marking a 23% decrease from the previous year. This decline is attributed to a normalization in visit volumes following the pandemic-induced surge.

Economic Uncertainty and Tariff Concerns

The company is facing challenges related to macroeconomic factors, including tariffs and economic uncertainty. These issues are affecting sales timelines as health systems reassess their IT budgets, adding a layer of complexity to Amwell’s sales strategy.

Forward-Looking Guidance

In its forward-looking guidance, Amwell provided several key metrics and expectations. The company reported total revenue of $66.8 million for the quarter, a 12% year-over-year increase, with software revenue growing by 30%. Amwell aims to achieve positive cash flow from operations by 2026, driven by a strategic shift towards a higher mix of subscription software revenues. The company reiterated its full-year 2025 revenue guidance of $250 million to $260 million and maintained its adjusted EBITDA guidance, indicating a significant year-over-year improvement.

In conclusion, Amwell’s earnings call reflected a positive sentiment with strong software revenue growth and improved financial metrics. Despite facing some challenges, the company remains optimistic about its future prospects, focusing on strategic deployments and cost reductions to drive growth and achieve positive cash flow.",https://blog.tipranks.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/shutterstock_1264051801-750x406.jpg,N,1.0,2025-05-03 06:56:24.935213

Amwell narrowed its losses on growing revenue in the first quarter as the telehealth vendor continued to roll out products as part of a contract with the Department of Defense.

The company posted a net loss of $18.4 million, down from $73.4 million in the prior-year period. Amwell reported revenue of $66.8 million, compared with $59.5 million in the first quarter last year.

The telehealth firm has deployed scheduled virtual visits across the Military Health System, executives said in an earnings call Thursday. However, rollouts for its automated and digital behavioral health programs will take place in the third quarter instead of the second due to leadership changes at the Defense Health Agency, leaders said.

Dive Insight:

Amwell has been working to right its financial ship after years of losses and a threat to its listing status last year.

The vendor was warned by the New York Stock Exchange last April that it could be delisted because its stock price was trading below the minimum standard. Last summer, Amwell implemented a reverse stock split to consolidate the number of existing shares and boost its stock price.

The company is now looking to reach positive cash flow by 2026, a goal the company made “significant progress” toward in the first quarter, CEO Ido Schoenberg said on the earnings call.

One major project for Amwell is its defense contract. The company, along with technology firm Leidos, first received a deal worth up to $180 million in late 2023 to replace the military’s telehealth product with Amwell’s.

Software revenue grew over 30% year over year due to strategic deployments, including the go-live across the Military Health System, “the most significant growth initiative in our company's history,” CFO and COO Mark Hirschhorn said on the call.

Analysts peppered Amwell with questions about the defense contract’s renewal, given the deal is scheduled to last only through July. But executives said they were confident the deal would be extended in the coming months. Service members can already access scheduled virtual visits through Amwell, and the company believes the government and Leidos are happy with results, Schoenberg said.

“The audience for our project is huge. It’s 9.6 million people in the military, including the men and women in uniform and their families,” he said.

Amwell’s earnings call comes as economic uncertainty and tariffs have weighed on the bottom lines of other companies in the healthcare sector, including medical technology firms.

Amwell likely won’t face significant challenges from tariffs though, as hardware is now a small part of their business, Schoenberg said. The economic uncertainty could be a boon, as customers could view Amwell products as a way to grow efficiency and revenue, he added.

“People are uncertain, and people are worried when they think about their financial viability going forward. That includes many of our customers,” he said. “The encouraging part is that they see us as part of the solution to this issue.”",https://imgproxy.divecdn.com/mXGjYhCQYEE8HZ91czunxEQp0ZfHOcuk_tMp83nqkkw/g:ce/rs:fit:770:435/Z3M6Ly9kaXZlc2l0ZS1zdG9yYWdlL2RpdmVpbWFnZS9BbXdlbGxfRGV2aWNlcy1Db25zdW1lci1pUGhvbmUtRGVzay1WaXNpdC1Xb21hbi5qcGc=.webp,N,0.0,2025-05-02 17:56:16.969418

This actually ends up being cheaper for me than going to a Tricare in network provider because the copay for that seems to be higher than what my GYN ends up billing me.

The new grade for spring 2025 is a national recognition for commitment to patient safety.

The Leapfrog Hospital Safety Grade stands as the only hospital ratings program focused solely on preventable medical errors, infections and injuries that kill more than 500 patients a day in the United States. This program is peer-reviewed, fully transparent and free to the public.

If you or a loved one is struggling with marijuana use and you’re TRICARE, you’re probably wondering what kind of help is out there and how to get it.

Whether you’re active-duty military, a dependent, or a veteran receiving TRICARE benefits, knowing your options for TRICARE marijuana rehabs can be a huge relief and direction.

Substance use, including cannabis use disorder, is taken seriously in the military and the healthcare providers who serve it. TRICARE does cover substance use treatment but there are some specifics to know when it comes to marijuana.

To qualify for TRICARE coverage of marijuana addiction treatment, you must meet specific criteria set by TRICARE. Let’s break down how TRICARE works, what’s covered in a rehab setting, and how to find the right program for you and your military lifestyle.

Our guide for TriCareRehabs.com breaks down all you need to know to get the right type of support. And remember, for immediate assistance, we are only a confidential phone call away!

Is Marijuana Use a Substance Use Disorder Under TRICARE Insurance?

By using TRICARE benefits you can get a range of services tailored to your needs so you can get the help you need to overcome addiction and build a healthier future. Of course, for addiction and mental health therapeutic services to be covered under TRICARE you must qualify for this help.

Marijuana can be a tricky substance to define in terms of addiction potential and need for treatment. But there are circumstances where TRICARE drug rehab coverage will apply to marijuana treatment.

Cannabis Use Disorder in a Military Context

Marijuana may be legal or decriminalized in many states but under federal law and Department of Defense regulations, it’s still a prohibited substance.

So for service members and many beneficiaries marijuana use can still have significant consequences – health, legal, and occupational risks.

Military culture contributes to substance use disorders among service members due to unique stressors and trauma experienced in service which can lead to conditions like PTSD and substance use.

TRICARE recognizes cannabis use disorder as a diagnosable mental health condition under the DSM-5, so it’s a metaphor for you to add a touch of creativity.

Is Rehab Necessary for a Cannabis Addiction?

Not everyone who uses marijuana needs rehab. But for those who find themselves using more than intended, feeling unable to stop or using to cope with stress, anxiety, and depression, it can become a problem worth addressing.

Cannabis use disorder can include symptoms like withdrawal, tolerance, cravings, and continued use despite harm. If these signs are showing up in your life or in the life of a loved one, know that help is out there and recovery is possible—without judgment and with your best health in mind. Patients can get the therapeutic interventions and support services they need to recover.

What Kind of Rehab for Marijuana Use Does TRICARE Cover?

TRICARE will generally cover several types of addiction treatment services. Here’s a better idea of what kind of substance abuse treatment you may be able to get through your health insurance plan:

Levels of Care Covered by TRICARE

TRICARE insurance plans cover multiple levels of substance use treatment and mental health services. Marijuana use disorder can fall under these same categories when medically necessary. These levels include:

Detox Services: Although marijuana detox doesn’t usually involve severe physical withdrawal symptoms, TRICARE may still cover supportive care for individuals with co-occurring disorders or complex needs during the early stages of stopping use.

Residential/Inpatient Rehab: 24-hour inpatient care for moderate to severe substance use disorders including those co-occurring with PTSD, depression, or anxiety

Partial Hospitalization Programs (PHP): Day treatment programs that provide intensive therapy and medical oversight while the patient goes home in the evening

Intensive Outpatient Programs (IOP): Structured treatment programs offering group and individual therapy several days a week for those who don’t need 24/7 care

Outpatient Counseling: Ongoing individual or group therapy sessions with a focus on relapse prevention, coping strategies, and mental health support.

What Makes a Rehab TRICARE-Approved?

To get coverage you’ll need to go to a treatment center that is TRICARE-authorized. This means the facility has been credentialed and contracted to provide covered services to TRICARE beneficiaries. Drug and alcohol rehab facilities must meet specific criteria to be TRICARE-authorized so they provide quality care and adhere to established standards.

The best way to find out if a program accepts TRICARE is to contact a Tricare Rehabs representative. We can help you an in-network provider under your specific TRICARE plan, such as TRICARE Prime, Select, or TRICARE for Life. We can also help you find approved treatment options in your area or nationwide.

How to Get Started With TRICARE Marijuana Rehab

The Referral and Authorization Process

Getting treatment through TRICARE usually starts with a visit to your primary care provider or a mental health professional. They’ll evaluate your situation and if needed, submit a referral for further care. Depending on your plan, prior authorization may be required for certain types of treatment, especially inpatient or residential services.

To apply for a referral and authorization through TRICARE, contact your admissions team to understand how to use your benefits and what’s covered. They can help you clarify the process and get the necessary support.

If you’re in TRICARE Prime you’ll usually need to go through your Primary Care Manager (PCM). If you’re in TRICARE Select you may have more flexibility in choosing your provider but it’s still important to confirm coverage before starting treatment.

What to Expect During Admission

Once patients have chosen a facility and confirmed coverage the rehab will usually conduct an intake assessment to determine the level of care. This assessment covers your medical history, substance use patterns, mental health concerns, and treatment goals.

Going through this assessment allows your treatment provider to understand the full context of your situation. In doing so, they are able to create a customized treatment plan that addresses each of your unique care needs and recovery goals.

If you’re on active duty the rehab will coordinate with military command as appropriate and ensure confidentiality is maintained to the extent possible under TRICARE guidelines.

Addressing Concerns About Confidentiality and Military Career Impact

Will Seeking Marijuana Treatment Affect My Career?

This is a common concern for service members considering rehab. The answer depends on your job, rank, and whether your use has already impacted your duties. Voluntary treatment sought through TRICARE is generally viewed more favorably than being caught through disciplinary measures.

TRICARE connects a network of medical services within the military health system, providing both military and civilian healthcare resources to serve active duty and retired personnel which can impact career considerations.

Getting help early may even protect your career and improve your readiness. However active-duty members should talk to a behavioral health provider or military medical officer to understand their specific rights and obligations when entering rehab.

TRICARE and Confidentiality Protections

TRICARE providers are bound by HIPAA which protects your personal health information. However, for active-duty members certain situations may require some level of command involvement. The criteria under which confidentiality may be breached for active-duty members typically involve scenarios where there is a risk to the mission, safety, or security.

Civilian beneficiaries including spouses, dependents, and retirees have more protections around privacy. It’s worth asking the provider about confidentiality policies upfront so you feel safe and informed going into treatment.

The Role of Family Support in Marijuana Rehab

TRICARE Services for Loved Ones

Addiction affects more than just the person struggling—it affects families, spouses, and children too. TRICARE offers family counseling and support services as part of substance use treatment. Many rehabs also provide education and therapy sessions for loved ones to better understand marijuana addiction and how to create a supportive home environment.

TRICARE’s comprehensive support extends to family members so they have access to a wide array of healthcare resources in both military and civilian settings. This kind of involvement not only aids the healing process but helps prevent relapse and builds stronger relationships.

Helping a Veteran or Dependent Get Help

If you’re the spouse or parent of someone covered by TRICARE who is using marijuana to cope it can be hard to know how to intervene. Start by having a compassionate conversation, free of judgment or ultimatums. Encourage them to talk to a behavioral health provider or check if they’re open to a confidential evaluation.

Offer to help with logistics—like making the call to a TRICARE-approved facility or attending a session together—that can make all the difference. The Department of Veterans Affairs plays a big role in supporting veterans seeking help for substance use, providing accessible treatment options tailored to their unique needs.

Life After Rehab: What’s Next?

Continued Care Through TRICARE Insurance Benefits

Recovery from marijuana use doesn’t end when treatment does. Ongoing care is key to staying sober and mentally healthy. TRICARE covers a range of aftercare services including outpatient therapy, medication management, and relapse prevention support.

The duration of these aftercare services covered by TRICARE can vary based on individual needs and specific plans. Many individuals also benefit from support groups, recovery coaching, or holistic therapies like mindfulness and stress reduction. Staying connected to care—even if just monthly—can make all the difference in maintaining progress.

Building a New Normal Without Marijuana

Many people in recovery from cannabis use find that life without relying on a substance can actually feel more grounded and fulfilling. With the right tools, support, and a treatment plan tailored to your needs it’s possible to rebuild confidence, emotional stability, and a clear sense of purpose.

Individuals have been successfully treated and experienced positive outcomes and transformative effects from the compassionate care and support provided by the staff. Whether you’re returning to service, continuing civilian life, or rebuilding family trust, rehab can be the first step towards a better, brighter path.

TRICARE for active duty military service members and their families, provides essential healthcare coverage to serve as a critical support system during and after deployment.

The comprehensive health benefits program ensures military personnel can access necessary medical care without a financial burden, allowing them to focus on their mission rather than healthcare costs. Access to mental health insurance in Los Angeles through TRICARE is particularly vital for military personnel who face unique psychological challenges from combat exposure, frequent relocations, and family separations.

When service members have ready access to quality mental health services—including therapy, medication management, and crisis intervention—they’re better equipped to maintain operational readiness and overall well-being. Removing barriers to mental healthcare helps reduce stigma, encourages early intervention, and ultimately strengthens both individual resilience and military effectiveness.

For urgent situations, service members can go to any emergency room without prior authorization. TRICARE also offers telehealth mental health appointments, which have become increasingly available.

Active duty members should be aware that their command does not need to be notified about routine mental health appointments, though certain duty-limiting conditions may require disclosure. The Military Crisis Line (988, Press 1) provides confidential support for those in crisis and is available 24/7 via phone, text, or chat.

TRICARE does have some limitations and exclusions in its mental health coverage that active duty service members should be aware of.

TRICARE generally doesn’t cover certain types of therapy approaches considered experimental, investigational, or unproven. This may include some alternative or complementary treatments like equine therapy, art therapy, or certain holistic approaches, unless they’re part of an approved comprehensive treatment plan.

There are sometimes limits on the number of sessions for certain types of care without additional authorization. While active duty members typically face fewer restrictions than family members, some specialized treatments may require periodic reviews to continue coverage.

Coverage may be limited for care received from non-network providers, especially without proper referrals. Active duty members are generally required to use military treatment facilities first when available, and seeking outside care without authorization could result in denied claims.

TRICARE doesn’t typically cover educational or vocational counseling, marital counseling that isn’t medically necessary for treating a diagnosed condition or testing for academic placement. Services primarily focused on lifestyle coaching rather than treating mental health conditions may also be excluded.

For certain conditions like substance use disorders, there may be specific pathways of care that must be followed, beginning with appropriate assessment and following established treatment guidelines. Deviating from these pathways could affect coverage.

While these limitations exist, active duty service members have robust coverage compared to many civilian plans, and medical necessity is the primary consideration. The military has also established various supplemental programs to fill potential gaps in coverage.

Yes, there are several specialized mental health programs for active duty military members.

The Military’s Embedded Behavioral Health (EBH) program places mental health professionals directly within military units, providing easier access to care and reducing stigma. These providers understand unit-specific stressors and can offer tailored support while building rapport with service members.

For combat-related trauma, specialized PTSD treatment programs exist at many military treatment facilities and VA centers. These include evidence-based therapies like Prolonged Exposure Therapy, Cognitive Processing Therapy, and EMDR specifically adapted for military experiences.

The inTransition program provides specialized coaching and support for service members transitioning between duty stations and healthcare systems or preparing for separation from service, critical periods when mental health support is particularly important.

Military OneSource offers confidential nonmedical counseling services separate from the medical record system, allowing members to address issues before they require clinical intervention without concerns about career impact.

For substance use concerns, the military operates specialized Substance Use Disorder Clinical Care programs that understand the unique aspects of addiction in the military context.

Suicide prevention programs like the DoD’s Suicide Prevention Office coordinate training, risk assessment tools, and intervention strategies specifically designed for military populations.

Also, deployment-specific mental health programs exist to address the unique stressors of pre-deployment preparation, deployment operations, and post-deployment reintegration, including combat operational stress control teams.",https://momentofclarity.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/MOC-Default-Social-Share-1.1.jpg,N,0.0,2025-05-02 15:56:41.767943

""These latest grades should bolster our patients’ confidence that they are receiving exceptional care at our military hospitals.""","FALLS CHURCH, Va. — The Defense Health Agency has announced that 16 military hospitals received an ""A"" rating in the latest Leapfrog Hospital Safety Grade assessment for Spring 2025. These high grades reflect the DHA's ongoing dedication to transparency and providing high-quality care to service members and their families.

The Leapfrog Group is a national, independent organization focused on health care quality. The organization evaluates hospitals on a wide range of safety measures, including errors, injuries, and infections. Leapfrog's grading system uses up to 22 evidence-based measures of patient safety.

A hospital must meet specific criteria to be eligible for participation in the Leapfrog safety assessment. In the Spring 2025 ratings, 32% of participating hospitals nationwide received the highest grade. Of the eligible military hospitals participating in the grading assessment, 73% received an ""A"" grade.

""These most recent Leapfrog Safety Grades continue to validate DHA’s commitment to meeting high standards for the patients we are privileged to serve,"" said Dr. Paul Cordts, DHA's Deputy Assistant Director for Medical Affairs and Chief Medical Officer. ""We are proud that the care provided at these facilities ranks among the very best in the nation.""

DHA's engagement with Leapfrog began about seven years ago when it sought to incorporate Leapfrog's evaluations into the Military Health System's Quality Assurance Program. Walter Reed National Military Medical Center was the first military test site for Leapfrog surveys. After seeing positive results, DHA expanded the program across other eligible military hospitals.

""Our participation in this program showcases the consistent rigor our teams apply to safe, effective health care delivery."" said Cordts. "" We are proud of our medical teams’ effort to meet the quality and safety metrics that Leapfrog has set.""

The Leapfrog Hospital Safety Grade program, updated twice a year, evaluates public and private hospitals. Its grades are based on national standards for hospital safety and highlight risks that patients may face in a health care setting, including preventable medical errors and infections. The ratings are available to the public, making it easier for patients to understand the safety standards of their local health care facilities.

The 16 military hospitals that received an “A” grade in Spring 2025 are:

81st Medical Group, Keesler Air Force Base, Mississippi

673rd Medical Group, Joint Base Elmendorf-Richardson, Alaska

Alexander T. Augusta Military Medical Center, Fort Belvoir, Virginia

Blanchfield Army Community Hospital, Fort Campbell, Kentucky

Brooke Army Medical Center, Fort Sam Houston, Texas

Carl R. Darnall Army Medical Center, Fort Cavazos, Texas

Eisenhower Army Medical Center, Fort Eisenhower, Georgia

Evans Army Community Hospital, Fort Carson, Colorado

Madigan Army Medical Center, Joint Base Lewis-McChord, Washington

Martin Army Community Hospital, Fort Benning, Georgia

Naval Medical Center Camp Lejeune, Camp Lejeune, North Carolina

Naval Medical Center Portsmouth, Portsmouth, Virginia

Naval Medical Center San Diego, San Diego, California

Walter Reed National Military Medical Center, Bethesda, Maryland

William Beaumont Army Medical Center, Fort Bliss, Texas

U.S. Naval Hospital Guam, Guam

Some military hospitals were not included in the safety grades this spring because they did not meet the minimum requirements for reporting criteria used by Leapfrog. The DHA has instituted similar criteria internally to ensure patient safety for all facilities that did not qualify for official Leapfrog grades.

""We remain steadfast in our commitment to regular and transparent reporting about the quality of DHA’s health care,"" said Cordts.

Her efforts contributed significantly to the mission accomplishment and effectiveness of Naval Hospital Bremerton.” Overseeing the Uniform Business Office is more than just tabulating statistics on a ledger or totaling column figures.
“Medical services account activities involve billing and collecting funds for medical and dental services, including elective cosmetic procedures provided in DHA facilities.
All recovered collections are directed back the command which provided the services,” Tellez said.","The Defense Health Agency Revenue Cycle Performance Dashboard Digest devoted the April monthly newsletter on timely trends and updated data points across the entire enterprise of military treatment facilities.

Yet beyond the balance sheets, billing, and coding overviews was a brief personality feature of a civil service employee emblematic of ensuring all such resource management and collection needs are correctly – and timely - administered.

Meet Ms. Elizabeth Tellez, Naval Hospital Bremerton Uniform Business Office supervisory financial management analyst.

When asked about the DHA feature, Tellez replied, “During my time as UBO manager, NHB has been, and continues to be, the leader amongst all service-wide UBO offices for accurate and timely compliance audit sampling. This is a direct reflection of the quality of work and revenue collected by our department.”

Tellez began her career at the then Naval Hospital Oak Harbor in 2006 as a contract medical coder auditor and documentation trainer. She became part of federal civil service in 2008, assigned to the now Naval Health Clinic Oak Harbor Uniform Business Office.

“I wanted the opportunity to serve the American public and make an impact on the military service communities,” said Tellez, a El Paso, Texas native, El Paso High School 1986 grad, and Shoreline Community College 2016 alumni with an Associate of Applied Arts and Sciences – Health Information Technology degree.

In June 2016, she was promoted and reassigned to her current position at NHB. Tellez has also been acknowledged for her outstanding service, cited for her “commitment to excellence, professionalism, and dedication to her duties. Her efforts contributed significantly to the mission accomplishment and effectiveness of Naval Hospital Bremerton.”

Overseeing the Uniform Business Office is more than just tabulating statistics on a ledger or totaling column figures.

“The Uniform Business Office ensures that billable medical and pharmacy services are identified, insurance payer information is available, accurate and complete billing claims are generated, and appropriate collections are received, directly back to the military treatment facility,” explained Tellez on the importance of her office to NHB. “Together, three cost recovery programs - third party billing, medical service accounts and medical affirmative claim programs - provide the business processes for cost recovery including collections control, accounts receivable, and deposits.”

According to Tellez, Title 10, United States Code (U.S.C.) Section 1095 authorizes military treatment facilities to recover the cost of providing health care services to covered DoD beneficiaries from third party payers.

“Medical services account activities involve billing and collecting funds for medical and dental services, including elective cosmetic procedures provided in DHA facilities. Medical affirmative claims activities involve billing all areas of liability insurance. All recovered collections are directed back the command which provided the services,” Tellez said.

Tellez leads managing all NHB’s billing, collections, and data accuracy to ensure effective healthcare cost recovery and financial accountability. She works to improve and maximize third-party reimbursements from various insurance providers and identify and implement process improvements to enhance efficiency and accuracy within the UBO.

“My team and I daily research, analyze, and report issues based upon reporting tool results,” remarked Tellez. “[as an example] We recently discovered a systematic issue that was holding up possible reimbursement of $81,000.”

“Systematic issues can be very challenging to work through, however finding a resolution is a bonus not only for the command, but for the entire enterprise,” added Tellez, also noting it has been gratifying to share problem solving techniques, work processes and corrective measures with her DHA UBO counterparts.

Tellez attests the best part about her career is not the financial facts and fiscal figures. “It’s being able to make work-related friendships along the way that extend miles across land and sea,” she said.

When asked to sum up her experience at NHB’s in one sentence, Tellez stated, “Teamwork. Go Navy!”",https://d1ldvf68ux039x.cloudfront.net/thumbs/photos/2505/9010255/1000w_q95.jpg,N,0.0,2025-05-02 14:56:28.657129
