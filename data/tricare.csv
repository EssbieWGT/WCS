The company reported a $42.9 million net loss and a $30.7 million non-cash asset impairment charge. Liquidity concerns intensified as

Puerto Rico Federal Affairs Administration Executive Director Gabriella Boffelli on Tuesday emphasized the strong collaboration between Gov. Jenniffer González Colón and Resident Commissioner Pablo José Hernández Rivera in successfully advancing House Resolution (HR) 6031, the Medicare Advantage Integrity Act, in the U.S. Congress.

The achievement, she said, was made possible through bipartisan support and aims to further a congressional agenda that benefits the people of Puerto Rico.

“The [resident] Commissioner has acknowledged the positive initiatives spearheaded by the governor during her congressional tenure and has continued to advocate for the benefit of the people,” said Boffelli, who served as González Colón’s chief of staff during her time as resident commissioner. “We are committed to working together to ensure that these important measures progress through the federal legislative process.”

One of the key measures introduced by Hernández Rivera is HR 2632, the TRICARE Equality Act. The initiative, originally proposed by former Gov. Pedro Pierluisi Urrutia during his time as resident commissioner, seeks to expand TRICARE Prime health benefits to military personnel, veterans and their families in Puerto Rico. While serving as resident commissioner, González Colón successfully advocated for an amendment in the Fiscal Year 2019 National Defense Authorization Act that requested that the Department of Defense gather crucial data needed to extend TRICARE Prime health care benefits to the island, ensuring that retired military personnel and their families receive equal support to those in the states. The effort has established a solid foundation for advancing the bill in subsequent years.

Additionally, the resident commissioner has introduced three other measures that were originally championed by González Colón during her congressional term:

1. HR 1696, the Puerto Rico Low-Income Housing Support Act, aims to revise the U.S. Housing Act of 1937 to redefine the extremely low-income category, thereby increasing eligibility for federal housing programs. Doing so will ensure that Puerto Rico adheres to the same low-income standards as the rest of the United States. The reintroduction of the measure reinforces the governor’s ongoing advocacy in Congress for broader access to federal housing programs in Puerto Rico, addressing the housing shortage and the need for more affordable and accessible options for low-income families. As governor, González Colón remains dedicated to initiatives focused on affordable housing and homeownership, Boffelli noted.

2. HR 5168, the Puerto Rico Nutrition Assistance Fairness Act, aims to transition the Nutritional Assistance Program, known locally as PAN by its acronym in Spanish, to the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, widely known as SNAP. This transition is designed to provide greater benefits for food assistance recipients and enhance economic activity, aligning Puerto Rico with the states, Washington, D.C., the U.S. Virgin Islands and Guam. With more than 200 organizations endorsing the measure, which has garnered bipartisan support, Boffelli pointed out, the governor continues to advocate for this transition in Congress, ensuring Puerto Rico is prepared for it.

3. HR 6031, the Medicare Advantage Integrity Act of 2025, seeks to increase Medicare Advantage payments and eliminate disparities in provider payments, ultimately improving healthcare for more than 670,000 beneficiaries of the program on the island. On Nov. 10, the governor reached out to U.S. Health and Human Services Secretary Robert Kennedy Jr. and Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) Administrator Mehmet Oz, urging them to provide stronger support for the Medicare Advantage program for Puerto Rico’s seniors. She has also engaged with CMS to advocate for necessary administrative adjustments that reflect the medical cost realities in the U.S. territory and address the urgent need to retain specialists and healthcare providers.","https://static.wixstatic.com/media/a793f9_1f9d086892794d04b9df6d7a587c290c~mv2.jpg/v1/fill/w_1000,h_792,al_c,q_85,usm_0.66_1.00_0.01/a793f9_1f9d086892794d04b9df6d7a587c290c~mv2.jpg",N,0.0,2025-11-19 01:56:19.317696

If passed, the bill would require the Department of Defense (DoD) to give TRICARE beneficiaries clear, repeated notices when their coverage is about to change, giving them time to plan, budget, and make informed choices.

An Iraq War veteran, Ryan is member of the House Armed Services Committee, and is also the first West Point graduate to represent the Academy in Congress.

“Military families have sacrificed so much for this country – it’s absolutely unacceptable that their coverage can be ripped away without notice. It’s entirely un- American,” Ryan said. “Especially amid rising health care costs in the Hudson Valley and nationwide, we have to be all-hands-on-deck to deliver much-needed relief to military families across the country. Our military families have stepped up and sacrificed for us, now we need to do right by them.”

Military families and retirees can face complex healthcare transitions that can cause confusion and unexpected costs. Under current rules, dependent children lose regular TRICARE eligibility at age 21 (or 23 if enrolled in school). Families may purchase TRICARE Young Adult (TYA) coverage until age 26, but premiums exceed $570/month for TYA Prime and $300/month for TYA Select. At age 65, beneficiaries must enroll in Medicare Part B to maintain TRICARE for Life coverage, a requirement many retirees learn about too late, which can lead to missed enrollment windows, coverage gaps, and higher out-of-pocket expenses. This bill is designed to ensure beneficiaries receive timely, repeated notifications and clear guidance, allowing them to plan ahead, avoid coverage gaps, and manage costs Ryan stated.

The TRICARE Transition Transparency Act will:

* Require the DoD to notify TRICARE beneficiaries one year, 180 days, and 30 days before a coverage change takes effect.

* Apply to any TRICARE coverage transition requirement, including switching from regular TRICARE to TYA at age 21 (or 23 if a full-time student) and transitioning to TRICARE for Life at age 65.

The study, published in JAMA Network Open, provides hopeful data following a grim period where veteran suicide rates—particularly among those with a traumatic brain injury (TBI)—far outpaced the general population.

“When we started looking at this earlier, there was actually a protective effect for being a veteran. It was called the ‘Healthy Warrior Effect,'” said principal investigator Mary Jo Pugh, a professor of epidemiology at the University of Utah’s Spencer Fox Eccles School of Medicine.

This protective effect, however, reversed as the War on Terror continued.

“Our earlier work showed that around 2006 is when veteran rates of suicide… started to increase,” Pugh noted. “That’s after a period of people being deployed to wars repeatedly since 2001 or 2002. But it’s not just deployment because those who deployed had lower rates of suicide—it is a complex issue.”

The disparity quantified by Pugh’s study is stark: While U.S. adult suicide rates reached about 20 deaths per 100,000 people by 2020, the rate for post-9/11 veterans with TBI peaked at 100 deaths per 100,000, and 61 per 100,000 for those without TBI. According to the Veterans Administration, more than 140,000 veterans have died by suicide since 2001.

A welcome reversal in suicide rates

The study’s most important finding is that veteran suicide rates have dropped sharply since 2020. Pugh suggests this may be due to a “critical mass” of suicide prevention measures, such as the Prevention 2.0 Initiative, the Suicide Prevention Now initiative and the President’s Roadmap to Empower Veterans.

“There’s been a huge emphasis on safe gun use, like providing veterans locks for their guns, which may have an impact,” Pugh said, noting that most veteran suicides involve firearms.

However, she believes it’s a combination of factors. “They’ve got a variety of different approaches to help people… reduce impulsive behavior,” she added. “One size never fits all for any kind of mental health condition or treatment.”

Pugh, a former Air Force nurse, brings a personal perspective to the research. She was medically retired after suffering polytrauma injuries (including TBI) in a bicycle collision with a car piloted by a drunk driver. She went on to earn a doctorate in developmental psychology, which she has used to examine long-term outcomes of military experiences such as TBI.

Eight years ago, she brought her research group, TORCH (Trajectories of Resilience, Community and Health), to the University of Utah. Pugh’s team developed a cohort of all service members and veterans who served on active duty after 9/11 for three or more years (>2.5 million) to conduct population-based analyses of outcomes associated with TBI and other exposures.

Other long-term health outcomes

The group’s recent work on TBI has earned Pugh the Outstanding Research Accomplishment award at the 2025 Military Health System Research Symposium for its groundbreaking research on the long-term outcomes of TBI. That research demonstrates that the consequences of TBI—which affects about one in five post-9/11 veterans—go far beyond suicide risk. Her team found TBI is also linked to other long-term health consequences, including dementia, substance use disorder and even cardiovascular disease.

“Documenting these patterns of risk is a crucial step toward implementing preemptive interventions to help veterans stay healthy,” Pugh said.

TORCH and its affiliated scientists have published numerous studies linking various health outcomes and TBI in veterans, with more studies in the pipeline. Another recent study documents elevated risk for cancers of the central nervous system (CNS), such as glioblastoma, for female veterans with TBI.

This paper examined data covering 422,715 female veterans with 1,229 cancer deaths from 2002 to 2020. “The mortality rate ratio was much higher, almost six times higher than the general population,” she said. The finding is in line with other studies that found elevated CNS cancer risk for those with brain injuries, even among civilians. What might increase the risk for service members and veterans is the inflammation associated with TBI and environmental exposures, including burn pits, occurring alongside the head injury.

“If you have a more severe injury where there’s a blood-brain barrier breach—and even now we find that even with mild TBI, sometimes there’s a blood-brain barrier breach— and if your injury occurs in a situation where there might be fire or flames, even a car accident, that might get into the brain and increase the likelihood of having an exposure that’s synergistic with the TBI,” Pugh explained.

Both these studies appear in JAMA Network Open. The one titled, “Suicide Rate Trends for Post–September 11, 2001, US Military Veterans,” was published Sept. 3, listing Jeffrey Howard of the University of Texas, San Antonio, as first author. The second study, titled “Cancer Mortality Rates in Female Veterans With and Without TBI,” was published March 13, listing Christin DeStefano of the Walter Reed National Military Medical Center as first author. Funding was provided by the Department of Defense and the Department of Veterans Affairs.

MOAA is engaging with Defense Health Agency officials and lawmakers on this issue, stressing that:

Creating separate pharmacy coverage tiers for TRICARE and TRICARE For Life beneficiaries sets a dangerous precedent, one that could weaken the medical benefit moving forward.

TRICARE coverage of GLP-1 medications tied to weight loss has never been for cosmetic purposes. All beneficiaries who received authorization had documented comorbid medical conditions.

Beneficiaries who lose coverage, many of whom are on fixed incomes, are facing a difficult choice – they can continue with medication that may have greatly improved their health and overall quality of life, but only if they are willing to risk financial security.

That’s one reason we started #DHAProud Days, so we’d have an opportunity every month to celebrate the DHA workforce.
Our health care workers are under so much stress and that stress impacts the entire team.","As Defense Health Agency Senior Enlisted Leader Air Force Chief Master Sgt. Tanya Y. Johnson departs the role on Nov. 20, 2025, she will leave behind a legacy of dedication to military health care delivery and commitment to the readiness and morale of thousands of health care professionals caring for our nation’s warfighters.

A self-described “military sprout, because you grow where you're planted when you're in the military,” Johnson was born into military medicine — quite literally — at Wilford Hall Ambulatory Surgical Center, Texas, to a U.S. Air Force medic. Following in her father’s footsteps, she joined the U.S. Air Force as an Airman Basic in October 1993. “It was just a matter of when I was going to join,” she said.

While Johnson trained as a laboratorian, she had her sights set on leadership from the start. “I wanted to be a chief so I could take care of my people,” she said. From her ambitious beginnings in the lab to various deployments to championing DHA’s military medical mission — she brought a wealth of experience with her empathetic leadership style and tireless dedication to beneficiaries and the workforce who cares for them.

Johnson sat down with the DHA news team to reflect on her career-long commitment to the Military Health System, helping provide a medically ready force and ready medical force, and advocating for the people who make military medicine possible. “I’ve always wanted to give back,” she said. “The bottom line is nothing matters if the people doing the work aren't taken care of.”

Question: How did you find yourself in the running for the Defense Health Agency Senior Enlisted Leader role?

Johnson: I’ve been lucky. There have been a lot of great senior leaders throughout my career who helped me get where I am today. In 2013, when I was at Joint Base Langley-Eustis, I started hearing about DHA. Keesler Air Force Base was one of the first facilities to go under the authority, direction, and control of DHA and I was pulled up to be the squadron superintendent, helping the facility transition. I saw DHA as an exciting opportunity to keep military medicine moving forward. I went on deployment right after Keesler transitioned, and when I returned and saw that things weren’t moving as fast as I thought they would, I asked questions. I ended up working as senior enlisted leader in DHA administration and management under Dr. Barclay Butler and the rest is history.

Question: How did your deployments with Operation United Assistance, Operation Inherent Resolve, and Operation Deliberate Resolve shape your experience?

Johnson: On deployment you’re often going into an unknown situation. To succeed, everyone must work together to support the mission. From a medical perspective, deployments showcase medics at their best. Building a health care facility that’s ready to go within 12 hours of boots on the ground, and then having the privilege of supporting health care workers — is there any more fulfilling mission? Add to that the joint relationships, not just between the services but with our allied partners and seeing how those relationships are reinforced, was incredibly valuable.

Question: Where do you see the biggest opportunities for growth and innovation at DHA over the next several years?

Johnson: Technology is our greatest opportunity. We all know there’s a shortage of health care professionals in this country. We need to find new ways to deliver care to meet our military medical mission. There's so much out there, the things we see at conferences like DHITS (Defense Health Information Technology Symposium) and HIMSS (Healthcare Information and Management Systems Symposium) … I hope DHA can find a way to get that technology into the hands of patients and providers.

Question: What do you see as the biggest challenges facing DHA in coming years and how is DHA preparing to meet those challenges?

Johnson: DHA needs to modernize its infrastructure — everything from computers to the facilities — to continue delivering the best possible care. That means showing the value of investing those dollars. That’s a challenge because money spent on infrastructure is money not spent on something else. There are always going to be competing priorities, and I don't envy the people having those conversations, but we owe it to our patients and staff to find a way to make it happen.

Question: What are you most proud of from your time at DHA?

Johnson: The people. What we do isn’t easy, and I’m proud of the compassion and discipline of our workforce. It’s humbling to work alongside such a dedicated team. I’m also proud of what DHA has accomplished. We’ve made great strides in things like our electronic health record (MHS GENESIS) and network structure. The last few years I’ve noticed a real cohesiveness around our shared vision. It’s been amazing to witness.

Question: What advice would you give your younger self about being a successful leader?

Johnson: To succeed in a joint environment, you need to learn and understand the cultural nuances and terminology of the other services. Those differences matter, especially as a leader. Taking time to learn and use words like shipmate and deck plate when visiting a Navy hospital, for example, show the sailors on board you respect them. Once your people see and feel your respect, it’s easier to pull them together and keep everyone moving in the same direction.

Question: Your catchphrase is “lead with grace.” What does it mean to lead with grace?

Johnson: Leading with grace means practicing compassion and empathy for others, assuming positive intent and acknowledging that everyone is trying their best. Leaders set the tone. If a leader is respectful and understanding, their people will be, too.

Question: You once said DHA’s core values of dependability, humility, and agility are an important part of who we are today and who we want to be in the future. What do DHA’s values mean to you?

Johnson: Patients depend on us to provide the care they deserve, and our staff depend on us for a safe, modern facility to provide that care. We need to be humble enough to hear and understand what our patients and staff tell us they need and then do our best to provide it. Agility means asking ourselves, “Are we changing with the times? Are we delivering at the speed of relevance?” and then finding ways to make change happen.

Question: Celebrating the workforce has been an important part of your role as SEL. How can DHA continue to recognize workforce contributions?

Johnson: We can't do what we do without our people. The DHA workforce is a huge force-enabler. Without our people, the warfighter doesn't go to war, retirees don't get their benefits, TRICARE doesn't provide for its 9.5 million beneficiaries. Our success depends on our workforce, and they should be tremendously proud of what they accomplish each and every day. That’s one reason we started #DHAProud Days, so we’d have an opportunity every month to celebrate the DHA workforce. We also have DHA Spotlights and the quarterly employee recognition awards, but we can always do more to acknowledge the incredible work being done across the agency.

Question: Is there anything you didn’t accomplish as SEL that you wish you’d been able to do?

Johnson: An organizational well-being platform was at the top of my list. Our health care workers are under so much stress and that stress impacts the entire team. We wanted to find a way to support them, to bring the temperature down and give them a chance to take a knee, take a breath, and fill their cup a bit. It was a way of giving back, and I’m hopeful it will launch in the future.

I also hoped to consolidate and optimize enlisted education at the Medical Education and Training Campus to focus on joint courses and shared resources. We have an enlisted working group of SELs looking at how we can consolidate the METC campus and the continuum of enlisted training, from METC to the MTFs (military treatment facilities) and advanced training. My hope is that sometime in the next three to five years you’ll walk into a classroom and see everyone training together.

Question: What surprised you the most about being DHA SEL?

Johson: Just how much was out of our control. So much of what we do is determined by legislation. Before coming to DHA, I’d often wonder why something wasn’t getting done or wasn’t getting done quickly. DHA is a small piece of a larger bureaucratic system and it's easy to see why that’s frustrating. The system is complex, and while we do everything we can to set the agency up for success — that often means making tough decisions.

Question: What advice do you have for the next SEL to help them succeed in the role?

Johnson: This job isn’t about what you want, it’s about being responsible and accountable to the agency, our beneficiaries, our workforce — everyone we’re privileged to serve. Stay the course. Trust your team. Get comfortable saying no. Remember that nothing happens without our people. They're the legacy we leave behind.

Question: What’s next after you retire from DHA?

Johnson: Finding a way to give back to the communities and people who supported me all these years. I believe in DHA and the MHS and I want to continue supporting the health care professionals doing the hard work, day in and day out.

Question: What message would you like to leave for the DHA workforce?

Johnson: Thank you for trusting me and thank you for continuing to take care of our beneficiaries and each other. It has been an honor to be part of your team and a true privilege to support you, advocate for you, and cheer your many, many successes. I hope you know how much I care about each of you.",https://d1ldvf68ux039x.cloudfront.net/thumbs/photos/2511/9392001/1000w_q95.jpg,N,0.0,2025-11-18 18:56:40.161524

To learn more about coverage, eligibility, and the types of immunizations TRICARE covers, visit TRICARE Immunizations.","Respiratory illnesses like respiratory syncytial virus, or RSV, and flu can spread quickly, especially during the fall and winter months. However, there’s an easy way to reduce your risk of serious illness—get vaccinated. TRICARE covers both RSV and flu immunizations for eligible beneficiaries, helping protect you and your family this season.

“Each year, RSV and flu hospitalize thousands of people—especially children, older adults, and those with underlying health conditions,” said Dr. Stacy Usher, lead nurse, TRICARE Health Plan, at the Defense Health Agency. “Immunization is the most effective way to prevent illness and protect those around you.”

Why these immunizations matter

Both RSV and flu are contagious illnesses that can cause symptoms like fever, cough, sore throat, congestion, and fatigue. They can spread from person to person—even before symptoms appear—making it easy to infect others. Getting immunized not only helps protect against infection but can also reduce the severity of illness if you do get sick.

Flu and RSV immunizations are available for many at-risk groups. Also, keep in mind:

• Both RSV and flu viruses spread easily in crowded settings such as schools, offices, and holiday gatherings. Getting vaccinated not only protects you but also helps protect vulnerable people close to you.

• Flu vaccines are updated each year to target the most common strains. They help reduce severity and spread. Flu is an annual vaccination recommended for everyone age 6 months and older. It’s recommended unless you have a specific contraindication, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

• RSV is a one-time immunization. It’s recommended for all adults ages 75 and older and for adults ages 50–74 who are at increased risk of severe RSV.

• The CDC recommends that pregnant women get the RSV immunization between 32-36 weeks to help protect their baby from illness after birth. In some cases, newborns may also get a preventive antibody for added protection. Talk to your provider to determine what’s best for you.

When should I get the flu immunization?

It’s best to get vaccinated for flu as soon as you can. But there’s no bad time to keep yourself and your family members protected. Flu season in the Northern Hemisphere tends to peak around mid-February but can last well into May. Getting vaccinated later in the season still offers protection.

Other RSV and flu prevention tips

In addition to immunization, you can help prevent the spread of RSV and flu by practicing a few simple things, as described by the CDC:

• Wash your hands regularly with soap and water.

• Cover your mouth and nose when you cough or sneeze.

• Avoid close contact with people who are sick.

• Try not to touch your eyes, nose, or mouth with unwashed hands.

• Stay home until your symptoms have eased.

How TRICARE covers RSV and flu immunizations

TRICARE covers both immunizations at no cost in accordance with CDC guidelines when administered by a TRICARE-authorized network provider or at a participating pharmacy, as described in the TRICARE Pharmacy Program Handbook.

If you’re eligible, bring your Uniformed Services ID card and:

• Contact your local military hospital or clinic for vaccine instructions and availability.

• Make an appointment with your TRICARE-authorized provider. However, if you get other services at the same time, you may have to pay copayments or cost-shares. These costs vary based on your health plan.

• Go to a TRICARE retail network pharmacy. Make sure the person who gives you the immunization is a pharmacist. If another type of provider (like a doctor or nurse practitioner) gives you an immunization at a participating pharmacy, you may have out-of-pocket costs. To find a network pharmacy near you, use the Find a Pharmacy Tool. Call ahead and make sure that the immunization is available at your location.

• If you go to a non-network pharmacy, you may have to pay for the vaccine out of pocket.

Don’t wait—protect yourself early

By consolidating contracts, broadening access, and closely managing performance, the contract delivers sustainable solutions across the DHA and the Military Health System.
“They are used by all of our hospitals and clinics significantly more than any other health care support contracts out there,” said Morvatz.
Efficient staffing for high-quality care Military hospitals and clinics can hire individual staff or entire services, such as an emergency department or clerical team.
“It provides a much more efficient and streamlined way for military [medical] treatment facilities to get contracted medical services,” Morvatz said.","A new multibillion-dollar contract vehicle is helping the Defense Health Agency ensure its military hospitals and clinics are staffed to support warfighters' health and medical readiness, while also caring for families and retirees at facilities worldwide.

The Medical Q-Coded Support and Services - Next Generation contract, or MQS2-NG, expands a system that has supplied military hospitals and clinics with health care providers for nearly 20 years.

“We've always been a leader in the field. Our contracts are probably the most innovative,” said Rich Morvatz, a deputy program manager in DHA’s acquisition and sustainment office, adding that MQS2-NG is the latest iteration of the DHA’s unique staffing process.

The 10-year contract provides military hospitals and clinics with a structured approach to hiring contracted physicians, nurses, dental staff, ancillary workers, and administrative personnel. MQS2-NG encompasses over 300 labor categories, spanning from direct patient care to support services across the federal health care system.

DHA leaders expect MQS2-NG to set the standard for federal medical staffing. By consolidating contracts, broadening access, and closely managing performance, the contract delivers sustainable solutions across the DHA and the Military Health System.

“They are used by all of our hospitals and clinics significantly more than any other health care support contracts out there,” said Morvatz.

At the heart of the contract is the goal of helping patients access high-quality health care quickly and efficiently.

“It allows the service member to focus on what they need to be mission-ready,” said Morvatz.

Efficient staffing for high-quality care

Military hospitals and clinics can hire individual staff or entire services, such as an emergency department or clerical team. The contract also reduces the number of contracts hospitals manage. It enables vendors to shift staff across hospitals and clinics to meet urgent needs, giving hiring personnel the flexibility to address shortfalls quickly.

“This contract provides a much more efficient and streamlined way for hospitals to get contracted medical services,” said Dan Rosera, MQS2-NG assistant program manager.

Dan Schaal, MQS2-NG assistant program manager, noted that “unlike single-award contracts, MQS2-NG uses two vendor pools. Eleven vendors were awarded in May 2024, and 20 small businesses followed in May 2025. Military hospitals and clinics assign tasks among these pre-vetted companies, making the process more effective and affordable.”

“This is a pretty unique contract,” Morvatz said. “Never before have we consolidated medical Q-coded services and medical support services requirements into one vehicle.” Another significant change, he said, is the introduction of unrestricted pools — any qualified, eligible vendor — and restricted — small or specific-needed businesses.

Benefits for hospitals and clinics, families, and readiness

MQS2-NG reduces administrative workload, provides faster access to contracted professionals by consolidating requirements, and creates a centralized pool of vendors.

“It provides a much more efficient and streamlined way for military [medical] treatment facilities to get contracted medical services,” Morvatz said. “That means fewer delays and fewer administrative hurdles.”

More than 350 contracting officer representatives have already been trained on how to issue task orders, ensuring military hospital and clinic leaders can use the system efficiently.

For patients, service members, and their families, benefits include improved access to care. Since hospitals and clinics rely on contractors for a significant percentage of their staffing, MQS2-NG helps ensure patients can see providers when needed.

“Beneficiaries are able to have more access to care in military hospitals and clinics,” Morvatz explained. “Contract staff supplement military and civilian providers, which helps reduce gaps and ensures continuity.”

Readiness remains at the center of MQS2-NG, providing service members with timely access to medical appointments. The contract helps them stay current on medical requirements and deployable, according to Rosera.

Oversight and accountability

The DHA’s Office of the Assistant Director for Support serves as the Component Acquisition Executive, overseeing all acquisition activities for the agency. The deputy assistant director for acquisition and sustainment directs the Program Management Office for Enterprise Medical Services, which manages daily execution of MQS2-NG with performance tracking built into every stage.

“We will know every single task order that was awarded, the labor categories, the cost, and whether positions were filled,” said Rosera. “That level of management makes this contract particularly valuable.” He explained the oversight in this contracting vehicle enables them to better track fraud, waste, abuse, and assess the effectiveness and efficiency of qualified work.

Contracting officer representatives provide monthly feedback, ensuring problems are identified early. Senior leaders emphasize task orders will be monitored closely.

“We manage this contract throughout its life,” Rosera said.

Broader federal reach and impact

The MQS2-NG contract is available to all federal agencies with health care needs or requirements, within and outside the Department of Defense. The Department of Veterans Affairs, Federal Bureau of Prisons, Indian Health Service, and Department of Health and Human Services have already expressed interest.

Morvatz noted Kathleen Berst, acting assistant director for support and the DHA component acquisition executive, “provided us the guidance to really look broader than just the DOD for this effort, to have a larger impact across the federal system.”

MQS2-NG is open to “health care support and services across the federal sector,” he said. “We want to make sure other agencies know they are included in the scope and welcome to award task orders.”",https://d1ldvf68ux039x.cloudfront.net/thumbs/photos/2310/8075384/1000w_q95.jpg,N,0.0,2025-11-18 15:56:48.161287

If you’re retiring and you’ll be able to keep Tricare, that’s the play. Absolutely hold on to Tricare with both hands. It’s substantially cheaper than any private insurance and it’s pretty good coverage. VA healthcare is hit or miss at best. They claim they’re comparable to real hospitals, but that’s mainly because they actively game the system to look artificially good. I was inspired to take a spicy ass pay cut so that I could get a job that offered insurance. In the end I got more and better care from a single visit to a rented office in a strip mall than I’d gotten in four years of arguing with the VA. My current insurance policy is going up to just shy of $500/mo with a $4k cap, and my family is covered by CHAMPVA (if your dependents are eligible for Tricare they can’t have CHAMPVA), so I could save a pretty substantial amount of money by pivoting to VA care.

The purpose of the event was to vaccinate the Kaiserslautern Military Community and maintain medical readiness.

The first week of the event is open Monday to Friday from 6 a.m. to 6 p.m. for active duty service members and first responders, and Monday to Friday from 6 a.m. to 5 p.m. the following week for beneficiaries such as retirees, dependents, civilian employees and contractors covered by TRICARE.

Children, ages four and below, may also receive their vaccines at the immunizations clinic, which offers a fast-track station for families.

“The vaccine we give is trivalent, meaning it protects against three different flu strains,” said U.S. Air Force Staff Sgt. Hernan Jaco Araujo, 86th HCOS noncommissioned officer in charge of the immunizations clinic. “Vaccines are one of the top medical advances in human history, second only to clean water.”

The POD setup allows the medical team to streamline vaccinations for the entire base population, a capability that is tested annually to ensure preparedness in case of a large-scale immunization event in response to a virus outbreak.

“It’s our proof of concept,” said U.S. Air Force Maj. Debra Burden, 86th HCOS primary care flight commander. “The goal is to vaccinate the entire installation within 96 hours if needed. This ensures that if a real-world scenario happens, then we can protect everyone quickly.”

Ramstein’s Department of Defense Education Activity schools continue to require influenza vaccinations for students, making the POD event all the more necessary.

“Here in the KMC, it remains mandatory,” Burden said. “Children must be vaccinated to attend school or participate in child and youth services programs.”

For active duty members, the vaccine is a readiness requirement. Failure to receive it results in an Individual Medical Readiness item flag, which can delay permanent change of station moves and deployments.

The immunization process at the POD is designed for efficiency. Patients complete a short health questionnaire, check in, receive their vaccination and check out all within minutes.

Burden emphasized the importance of basic hygiene and responsible behavior to prevent the spread of the flu.

“We encourage frequent handwashing, coughing into your elbow instead of your hands and staying at home if you’re sick,” Burden said. “If you’re ill, don’t try to tough it out at work or school, you’ll only spread it further.”",https://d1ldvf68ux039x.cloudfront.net/thumbs/photos/2510/9370142/1000w_q95.jpg,N,0.0,2025-11-18 12:57:23.474264

These include chiropractic care, hearing aids, eye exams for all plans other than TRICARE Prime, and TRICARE Extended Care Health Option for family members with serious physical, intellectual, or psychological disabilities.","Approximately 200,000 service members leave the military annually, according to the Department of Veterans Affairs. Navigating health care for yourself and your family after military retirement or medical separation can be confusing. One way to ensure a smoother transition to continuous coverage is to enroll in a TRICARE plan within the first 90 days after leaving the service.

You do have 12 months to retroactively enroll in TRICARE. As long as you enroll within those 12 months, your coverage will extend back to your first day of retirement. However, you will have to pay all the enrollment fees for previous months. Claims will not be paid until enrollment is complete.

If you do not enroll within those 12 months, you won’t have another opportunity until the next TRICARE Open Season or you have a new qualifying life event, such as marriage, divorce, birth, or death. Without TRICARE, you can only receive care at military hospitals and clinics if space is available.

Most service members will choose between TRICARE Prime and TRICARE Select for their coverage.

TRICARE Prime is similar to an HMO, where each beneficiary is required to choose a Primary Care Manager and receive referrals for specialist care.

TRICARE Select is more like a PPO and allows you to see any TRICARE-authorized provider without a referral.

TRICARE Select offers more flexibility and freedom of choice, and is available worldwide, even outside of Prime service areas. However, out-of-pocket costs will be higher than with TRICARE Prime. If you live outside the continental U.S., TRICARE Select Overseas might be your only option.

There are six areas in the U.S. where beneficiaries can enroll in the US Family Health Plan, including the majority of the Northeast region, central and eastern Texas, and the west coast. This plan allows you to see a network of private providers rather than using TRICARE network providers and military hospitals.

Family members who are eligible for Medicare must have Medicare Part B coverage to stay eligible for TRICARE. TRICARE For Life is available as wrap-around coverage for retired service members who have Medicare Part A and Part B. Coverage is automatic and does not require enrollment, but it does not extend to family members.

Some services that were available during active duty are no longer covered.

Military families have some decisions to make about their health care before Tricare open season ends Dec. 9.

Tricare officials released information about increases in health plan costs for 2026, so families can compare their options with Tricare Prime and Tricare Select. There's also a new health care choice for families living in the metro areas of Atlanta, Georgia, and Tampa, Florida.

[NEW! MOAA's TRICARE Guide]

Tricare open season applies to those enrolled in or eligible for Tricare Prime or Tricare Select. During this period, enrolled beneficiaries can make changes to their health coverage — such as switching from Tricare Prime to Tricare Select, or moving from individual to family enrollment. Depending on the plan, costs may include enrollment fees, premiums, cost-shares and co-payments.

Generally, those who have been paying out-of-pocket for health care under Tricare in 2025 will pay extra in 2026, according to the 2026 fee schedules.

Some Tricare beneficiaries are also eligible for the Federal Employees Dental and Vision Insurance Program, or FEDVIP. That program's open season ends Dec. 8. Note that's a day earlier than the end of Tricare open season.

It's also the time to enroll in the dependent care flexible spending program and the health care flexible spending program now offered to active-duty service members.

Any changes made during open season take effect Jan. 1.

Open season doesn't apply to individual active-duty service members, or to Tricare for Life, or to the premium-based plans of Tricare Reserve Select, Tricare Retired Reserve and Tricare Young Adult. These premium-based plans can be purchased at any time during the year, but those in Tricare Young Adult with either the Prime or Select options can only change plans during open enrollment or a qualifying life event.

If eligible beneficiaries don't enroll during open season, they must wait until a qualifying life event, such as the birth or adoption of a child, marriage, divorce, moving or changes to other health insurance, to enroll.

Those who are satisfied with their current plan don't need to take action.

[2026 PLAN COSTS: Find Out How Much You'll Pay]

But others, including 150,000 Tricare beneficiaries living in metro areas of Atlanta and Tampa have additional options to consider. They're eligible to enroll in a health care demonstration project, which is a Tricare Prime option. Defense Health Agency officials awarded the contracts for the project to CareSource Military and Veterans, a nonprofit managed care organization. CareSource will run the project in the two areas, worth a combined total of $110 million, for three years.

Those eligible who want to participate must actively take the steps to enroll.

A key benefit for those enrolled in Tricare Prime through this demonstration project is that they won't be required to get referrals for in-network specialty care, as is normally required in Tricare Prime.

The Plans

Tricare Prime is a health maintenance organization-style plan in which beneficiaries get most of their care from a primary care manager, with referrals required for specialty care. There is no deductible. Active-duty service members, their family members and transitional survivors don't pay enrollment fees or out-of-pocket costs for covered services, unless they get nonemergency care without a referral, use nonnetwork providers without authorization or use a pharmacy other than a military pharmacy. Retirees, their families and all others pay enrollment fees and out-of-pocket costs for covered services except for preventive care.

Tricare Select is a preferred provider organization-style plan in which beneficiaries choose their Tricare-authorized provider and don't have to get referrals for most services. There are deductibles, co-payments and cost-shares.

By law, there are differences in some costs based on when the sponsor entered the military. Those who entered before Jan. 1, 2018, are part of Group A, while those who entered on or after Jan. 1, 2018, are part of Group B.

Some Increased Costs

There are no co-payments for any group for covered preventive care visits.

For covered services such as primary care visits and specialty care outpatient visits, some co-pays will go up by $1 to $3 a visit as of Jan. 1.

An exception is the co-payment for emergency room visits for Tricare Select beneficiaries in Group A, for both active-duty families and retired members and their families, where the cost has gone down by $2 per in-network visit. For example, retirees and their families in that group will now pay $138; active-duty families in that group will now pay $103.

Another benefit for retirees, their family members and survivors who enroll in the Atlanta and Tampa demonstration projects is that Tricare Prime enrollment fees are waived for the first year of the demo.

For those eligible to enroll in Tricare Prime through the demonstration project, that's a savings of $381.96 per individual and $765 per family, for example, for retirees, family members and others in Group A.

The 2026 Tricare Prime Group A enrollment fee increases are $9.96 for individuals and $21 for families, compared to 2025 enrollment fees.

Pharmacy

Pharmacy costs are increasing in 2026 for those who fill their prescriptions outside a military health facility, reflecting a 12% to 15.8% rise over the current co-pays, which were set at the start of 2024.

Most beneficiaries will pay $1 to $9 more for covered drugs they get through the Tricare Pharmacy Home Delivery and at Tricare retail network pharmacies, according to the Defense Health Agency. These costs will be in effect through Dec. 31, 2027.

[UPDATED MONTHLY: MOAA's TRICARE Toolkit]

Active-duty service members pay nothing for covered drugs from military pharmacies, home delivery or retail network pharmacies. Co-payments won't change in 2026 for survivors of active-duty service members and medically retired service members and their family members.

Premium-Based Plans

Costs for the monthly premium for Tricare Young Adult Prime health plan are rising by 9% in 2026, from $727 a month to $794. The monthly premium for Tricare Young Adult Select are increasing by 8%, from $337 to $363 a month.

Tricare Young Adult plans are available to qualified former dependent children up to age 26. The premiums are set by the Defense Health Agency, and the program must be at no cost to the government, under rules set by Congress when the program was implemented in 2013. Defense officials look at the health care expenditures for the program for the previous year and calculate the costs for premiums.

Monthly premiums for Tricare Reserve Select and Tricare Retired Reserve are also increasing. For service members in Tricare Reserve Select, the premiums are rising by 8%, to $57.88 a month for the member only, and by 4%, to $286.66 for member and family premiums.

Those in Tricare Retired Reserve will pay an extra 2%, to $645.90 a month for the member only in January, and an extra 2%, to $1,548.30, for member and family premiums.

How to Enroll or Make Changes

Visit Tricare.mil/openseason to find information about making changes online, by phone or by mailing an enrollment form to their regional contractor. Beneficiaries can also visit milConnect.

Those who want to enroll in the demonstration project through CareSource in the Tampa or Atlanta areas can find information on those websites. They can also call customer service representatives at CareSource who will guide them through the process. That number is 833-230-2080.

While Tricare Select beneficiaries don't need referrals currently, they can elect to switch to the Tricare Prime option with the demo, where referrals aren't required.

Dental

Families of active-duty, National Guard and Reserve service members — as well as Guardsmen and reservists who aren't on active duty — are eligible for the Tricare Dental Program. That program requires a separate enrollment. The premiums will stay the same through Feb. 28, 2026.

Most retirees and their family members are eligible for dental coverage under the Federal Employees Dental and Vision Insurance Program, or FEDVIP, which is administered by the Office of Personnel Management and also requires separate enrollment.

Visit www.benefeds.gov to compare choices of dental plans available by ZIP code, and to enroll or make changes to an existing plan. FEDVIP open season ends Dec.8.

Vision

Active-duty family members, retirees and their eligible family members and Selected Reserve members and their families are eligible for FEDVIP vision coverage. They must be enrolled in a Tricare health plan to be eligible.

Visit www.benefeds.gov to compare choices of vision plans available by ZIP code, and to enroll or make changes to an existing plan. FEDVIP open season ends Dec. 8.

Flexible Spending Accounts

Now is also the time for setting up flexible spending accounts, which can be used to defray the costs of health care as well as dependent care.

Troops set aside pre-tax money to reduce the amount of taxable income. This is the third year service members can sign up for flexible spending accounts for dependent care; they began offering the health care FSA in March 2025.

These accounts are sponsored by the Office of Personnel Management through the Federal Flexible Spending Account Program. The open season sign-up for these accounts ends at midnight Eastern Standard Time, Dec. 8.

The Dependent Care Flexible Spending Account allows families to set aside any amount between $100 and $7,500 per household before taxes for dependent care expenses in 2026, including child care and other types of dependent care.

The Health Care Flexible Spending Account allows families to set aside any amount between $100 and $3,400 in 2026. More than 300 health care expenses are eligible for reimbursement through the FSA, including: co-pays and deductibles; out-of-pocket costs for braces; glasses and contact lenses; prescription drugs; over-the-counter medicines; bandages; and wellness treatments such as acupuncture, massage and chiropractic care. Other expenses, such as condoms, over-the-counter pregnancy tests and menstrual care products, are also eligible.

For more information and to set up the accounts for 2026, visit www.fsafeds.gov.

For help in determining whether to set up an account, and how much money to set aside, officials advise troops to take advantage of the Defense Department's free counseling and advice from personal financial management counselors at many military installations, and tax counselors available all year through DoD's Military OneSource. FSAFEDS also offers free benefits counseling.

WASHINGTON, DC – Congressman Pat Ryan – an Iraq War veteran, member of the House Armed Services Committee, and the first West Point graduate to represent the Academy in Congress – recently introduced the bipartisan “TRICARE Transition Transparency Act,” to ensure military families are given adequate, advanced information before any changes to their coverage go into effect. If passed, it will ensure that the rug cannot be ripped out from under military families with regard to their health care, and that they have the time and information they need to plan, budget, and make informed decisions.

The “TRICARE Transparency Act” follows Ryan’s recent re-introduction of the bipartisan “Health Care Fairness for Military Families Act,” landmark legislation which also aims to fix inequities in health care by extending TRICARE eligibility to 26 year olds and save an estimated 367,000 American military families as much as $8,724 per year in health care costs.

“Military families have sacrificed so much for this country – it’s absolutely unacceptable that their coverage can be ripped away without notice. It’s entirely un- American,” said Congressman Pat Ryan. “This bipartisan legislation will provide critical transparency to military families, and keep the rug from getting ripped out from under them. Especially amid rising health care costs in the Hudson Valley and nationwide, we have to be all-hands-on-deck to deliver much-needed relief to military families across the country. Our military families have stepped up and sacrificed for us, now we need to do right by them.”

Congressman Ryan introduced the “TRICARE Transition Transparency Act” alongside Congresswoman Jen Kiggans (R-VA). If passed, the bill would require the Department of Defense to give TRICARE beneficiaries clear, repeated notices when their coverage is about to change—ensuring families have time to plan, budget, and make informed choices.

At present, military families and retirees face complex healthcare transitions that can cause confusion and unexpected costs. Under current rules, dependent children lose regular TRICARE eligibility at age 21 (or 23 if enrolled in school). Families may purchase TRICARE Young Adult coverage until age 26, but premiums exceed $570/month for TYA Prime and $300/month for TYA Select. At age 65, beneficiaries must enroll in Medicare Part B to maintain TRICARE for Life coverage—a requirement many retirees learn about too late.

These transitions often come with little advance notice, leading to missed enrollment windows, coverage gaps, and higher out-of-pocket expenses. This bill ensures beneficiaries receive timely, repeated notifications and clear guidance, allowing them to plan ahead, avoid coverage gaps, and manage costs.

The “TRICARE Transition Transparency Act” will:

Require DoD to notify TRICARE beneficiaries one year, 180 days, and 30 days before a coverage change takes effect.

Apply to any TRICARE coverage transition requirement, including age-based changes like:

Switching from regular TRICARE to TRICARE Young Adult (TYA) at age 21 (or 23 if a full-time student).

Transitioning to TRICARE for Life at age 65.

Mandate that notices be delivered electronically and supported by an outreach campaign through TRICARE’s website, social media, and family readiness groups.

Require an annual report to Congress with metrics on outreach effectiveness and recommendations for improvement.

This bill builds on Ryan’s record of delivering for military families. His recently re-introduced bipartisan “Health Care Fairness for Military Families Act” would extend TRICARE coverage and save an estimated 367,000 American military families as much as $8,724 per year in health care costs.

Under current law, TRICARE dependents may only remain on their parents’ policy until they are 21 years old. If they are enrolled as a full-time student in an approved institution and if their parent pays more than half of their financial support, the dependent may remain on their parents’ policy until they turn 23 years old or are out of school, whichever comes first.

Dependents have the option to enroll in the TRICARE Young Adult program, and nearly 33,000 military families choose to do so. However, they must spend between $337 and $727 per month to cover the full cost of the program via a separate monthly premium, in a time when costs are rising and families across the country are feeling a strain on their wallets.

Congressman Ryan’s legislation would ensure equity for military families by bringing eligibility for young adult dependents in line with that offered by private insurance plans. Under the Affordable Care Act (ACA), children up to the age of 26 can remain on their parents’ health insurance plans with no additional out of pocket cost.

Congressman Ryan first introduced the “Health Care Fairness for Military Families Act” in the 118th Congress. The bill is cosponsored by more than 35 Members of Congress from both parties. The bill is also endorsed by dozens of national organizations who support military families, including the VFW and the National Military Family Association.

# # # About Naval Medical Center San Diego: The mission of NMCSD is to provide a superior experience for our patients, staff, and warfighters.","SAN DIEGO – Behind the doors of an operating room at Naval Medical Center San Diego, a team of medical and dental professionals are redefining what’s possible in the treatment and restoration of patients with life-altering head and neck injuries.

The Maxillofacial Restoration Program team at NMCSD is meticulously rebuilding faces and jaws destroyed by trauma, disease, or congenital defects. And what they are doing is more than reconstructing physical form and function—they are restoring patients’ lives and putting warfighters back in the fight.

“During my time at Walter Reed from 2011 to 2017, head and neck injuries—facial injuries—were the second most common injury in Iraq and Afghanistan,” said Cmdr. Daniel Hammer, program director and maxillofacial surgeon at NMCSD. “If you look at the current landscape with drone warfare and top-down trauma, head and neck injuries are only going to become more prevalent.”

The work being done by Hammer and his team at NMCSD is doing more than providing innovative care to patients; they are building a medical force that’s ready for the conflicts of tomorrow. They are ensuring that when our warfighters go into harm’s way, the team in San Diego will be standing by to provide the specialized care and treatment necessary to restore troops with head and neck injuries to full health and readiness.

By combining clinical expertise, 3D modeling, and virtual surgical planning, the team performs what is called ""jaw-in-a-day"" reconstruction—rebuilding a jaw by transplanting a segment of the patient's own leg bone (fibula) after placing dental implants into the bone and attaching prosthetic teeth in a single operation. Traditionally, the process of reconstructing a patient's jaw would take approximately two years and multiple procedures—a timeline not conducive with military readiness.

The results speak for themselves. Since November 2020, the program has treated more than 60 patients with a 94% return-to-duty rate for active-duty service members. Patients experience hospital stays of less than seven days, which is nearly half the national average of 12-13 days, and 100% are discharged without feeding tubes and walking unassisted within six weeks of surgery.

These outcomes are possible because of the program's integrated approach. The team is made up of highly skilled professionals from across nine clinical care pathways, including dental and maxillofacial prosthodontics, mental health and well-being, speech and language pathology, and anesthesia and pain management, working together seamlessly.

""Teamwork is really important in complex reconstruction,"" said Cmdr. Samuel Frasier, department chair for ear, nose, and throat. ""There's good data showing that teamed approaches improve patient outcomes, improve surgeon well-being, and decrease burnout. One of the advantages of working in the military system is that we have a structure that encourages collaboration in a way that's easier than in the civilian world.""

This tightly coordinated team collaborates across sixteen services and specialties from the earliest stages of a patient’s care plan, putting the patient at the center of everything they do.

""We built this team with the absolute focus on readiness and patient outcomes, and our program has done what few others in the world have done,"" said Hammer. ""Having somebody stand up and walk without a walker one day after surgery. Having somebody take a sip of water two days after having their face completely transplanted. Having this accelerated track with patients getting their final teeth four months after surgery. We can innovate without the silos that often slow progress in the civilian sector, and that collaboration allows us to move faster and achieve better outcomes for our patients.""

For patients, that means fewer surgeries, shorter recovery times, and, for warfighters, earlier return to duty. For the Defense Health Agency (DHA), it represents a model of how high-reliability practices, patient-centered care, and cross-service collaboration drive both improved outcomes and force readiness, which is part of DHA’s strategic vision for military medicine.

Lt. Col. Christopher Chang, an oral maxillofacial surgeon at Evans Army Community Hospital at Fort Carson, Colorado, said the DHA’s structure allows military surgeons across the services to learn from and contribute to one another.

“Something like this—where an Army surgeon and a Navy surgeon are able to work together across the services—that’s all part of the Defense Health Agency,” Chang said. “It’s good for us as surgeons and doctors to be able to take care of patients together.”

This cross-service collaboration exemplifies DHA’s commitment to meeting evolving healthcare challenges while ensuring readiness for future conflicts.

""Programs like this show how the DHA is transforming military medicine,"" said Rear Adm. Kevin Brown, director of Defense Health Network Pacific Rim, which has oversight of NMCSD. ""They demonstrate that readiness and patient-centered care aren't competing priorities—they're complementary enablers of a shared mission. We are investing in warfighting readiness through innovative processes to accelerate a patient's recovery while also investing in critical skill sustainment of our medical force. This restores the health of our fighting force and ensures we are ready to save lives on the battlefield when we are needed most.""

In an era where warfare is rapidly evolving and injuries are becoming more complex, the Maxillofacial Restoration Program demonstrates that one of military medicine's greatest strengths is its ability to unite diverse expertise around a single mission to achieve success.

By breaking down traditional medical silos and fostering collaboration across specialties and services, this program doesn't just rebuild faces; it transforms lives, restoring hope and readiness. For every warfighter who walks out of NMCSD ready to fight again and every patient who can face the world, military medicine is delivering on its promise to make extraordinary experiences ordinary and exceptional outcomes routine.

Management commentary and recent events

“Since joining the Company in August, the new management team has worked tirelessly to address the business and compliance challenges at Zynex while creating a new future for all our company,” said Steven Dyson, Chief Executive Officer of Zynex. “We have been focused on a three-part strategy: renewing our commitment to compliance and integrity, addressing the company’s current liquidity challenges, and improving revenue and cash flow performance. While the Third Quarter of 2025 was more of a continuation of first-half performance, we have seen progress with our strategy and we remain committed to rebuild and return the company to growth in the future.”

Zynex has engaged Province, LLC, an internationally recognized financial advisory firm, to assist on evaluating a range of strategic alternatives, including potential capital raising opportunities and recapitalization and restructuring strategies. In addition, Paul Aronzon has joined our Board of Directors and has been appointed as Chair of a Special Committee of the Zynex Board of Directors to oversee the assessment of the above-referenced strategic alternatives. This Committee will work closely with management, Province and counsel to assess and implement the strategic alternatives, as appropriate.

In order to preserve cash as the Company is evaluating strategic alternatives, Zynex has elected to enter the contractual thirty (30) day grace period and will not make a $1.5 million interest payment, due November 17, 2025, on the Company’s $60 million of Convertible Notes maturing in May 2026. The Company is in discussions with Convertible Note holders regarding potential restructuring opportunities with an ad hoc group of holders of the Convertible Notes, represented by Brown Rudnick LLP.

“We are taking decisive steps to ensure Zynex is well-positioned going forward,” said Steven Dyson. “The engagement of Province and the formation of the Special Committee reflect our commitment to exploring all avenues to create a new future for Zynex.”

The Company has not yet identified a strategic transaction and there can be no assurance any such transaction will result from the Special Committee’s evaluation of strategic alternatives, or the timing, terms and conditions of any such transaction.

Third quarter 2025 financial results

Net revenue was $13.4 million for the three months ended September 30, 2025, compared to $50.0 million in the prior year quarter. The declines in net revenue for the three months ended September 30, 2025 compared to the prior year period are primarily related to the Company’s Tricare payment suspension, along with a $2.8 million reduction in revenue related to payments received from Tricare during the suspension period. Through the third quarter of 2025, changes to certain payers’ claim submission and review practices have resulted in denials and payment delays, which has negatively impacted revenue. Additionally, workforce reductions in the first and second quarters of 2025 have negatively impacted device orders and corresponding supplies, new patients onboarding and order completion, contributing to the overall decline in net revenue during the three months ended September 30, 2025.

Gross profit in the quarter ended September 30, 2025, was $8.1 million, or 60% of revenue, as compared to $39.8 million or 80% of revenue, in the third quarter of 2024. Gross profit was lower due to the decrease in revenue, decreased revenue related to the Tricare revenue adjustment which had no corresponding decrease to cost of revenue, and less volume in our production facility to absorb fixed costs.

Sales and marketing expense for the three months ended September 30, 2025, decreased 54% to $9.5 million from $20.7 million for the same period in 2024, primarily due to decreased headcount in the sales force.

General and administrative expenses for the three months ended September 30, 2025, were $11.8 million, versus $15.3 million in the prior year period.

Net loss for the three months ended September 30, 2025, totaled ($42.9) million, or ($1.42) per basic and diluted share. In addition to our decline in revenue net loss was also negatively impacted by a non-cash asset impairment charge of $30.7 million during the quarter ended September 30, 2025, primarily related to goodwill, definite-lived intangible assets and certain fixed assets associated with Zynex Monitoring Solutions, Inc.

For the quarter ended September 30, 2024, net income was $2.3 million, or $0.07 per basic and diluted share.

Adjusted EBITDA loss for the three months ended September 30, 2025, was ($12.3) million, as compared to Adjusted EBITDA of $5.1 million in the quarter ended September 30, 2024.",https://medicalbuyer.co.in/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Zynex-Reports-net-loss-of-USD-42.9M-in-Q3-2025.jpg,N,0.0,2025-11-18 12:58:18.676457

For Context: The lawsuit comes amid broader efforts by the Trump administration to restrict transgender military service.
As of early 2025, Pentagon officials said 4,240 service members identified as transgender.

The Daily Caller (Right) focused on the legal aspects of the case and the process that led to the revocation of the retirement orders.","Seventeen transgender US Air Force service members have filed a federal lawsuit against the Trump administration, alleging they were forced to separate from active duty service, and that the government unlawfully revoked their early-retirement pensions despite each having 15 to 18 years of military service.

The Details: The plaintiffs argue that the Air Force improperly rescinded their previously approved early-retirement orders and benefits, calling the action “unlawful and invalid.” They claim the reversal forces them out of the military without retirement support, contrary to the Air Force’s own retirement instruction, which allows rescinding orders only under limited circumstances not present in their cases. The retirement approvals were originally issued in June 2025 and were later withdrawn after the Assistant Secretary for Manpower and Reserve Affairs was replaced. Plaintiffs say the change could cost them an estimated $1-2 million in lifetime benefits and end their access to TRICARE, the military health insurance program.

For Context: The lawsuit comes amid broader efforts by the Trump administration to restrict transgender military service. In February, the Pentagon argued transgender people are medically unfit for service. In March, a federal judge indefinitely blocked the administration’s attempt to ban transgender people from serving, however the Supreme Court allowed the ban to take effect in May while legal challenges continue in lower courts. As of early 2025, Pentagon officials said 4,240 service members identified as transgender.

How the Media Covered It: The story was covered more widely by outlets on the left. The Guardian (Left bias) emphasized the impact of the decision on the affected service members, and said the move is the latest in a string of actions targeting transgender military members. It, and The Hill (Center) quoted Lead plaintiff retired Master Sgt. Logan Ireland who underscored their determination to fight the decision, saying the rescission is “a betrayal of the sacrifices made” by them and their families. Both outlets also highlighted the economic impacts on the individuals affected. The Daily Caller (Right) focused on the legal aspects of the case and the process that led to the revocation of the retirement orders. It also mentioned the Pentagon's claim that the plaintiffs were ""prematurely notified"" of their approval for early retirement.",https://www.allsides.com/images/meta-images/allsides-logo-open-graph.png,N,0.0,2025-11-17 18:56:25.891279

Tanya Johnson, Defense Health Agency’s senior enlisted leader, said to a roomful of airmen who were attending the Frontline Supervisors Course at Malcolm Grow Medical Clinics and Surgery Center in Joint Base Andrews, Maryland, Sept. 30.
We must be able to rely on our frontline supervisors to make informed judgments, respond to crises under pressure, and carry out their objectives.
If you're upbeat, you're positive — that’s how your team will behave.” She stressed that U.S. Air Force medical personnel need these vital skills both in battle and in their dedication of warfighter care.
“Air Force medicine exists to project the lethality of the United States Air Force … we must be able to shoot, move, communicate — then medicate.”","“Make your career, your career,” Air Force Chief Master Sgt. Tanya Johnson, Defense Health Agency’s senior enlisted leader, said to a roomful of airmen who were attending the Frontline Supervisors Course at Malcolm Grow Medical Clinics and Surgery Center in Joint Base Andrews, Maryland, Sept. 30.

Johnson participated in a panel of senior enlisted leaders and field-grade officers at the day-long course — attended by top enlisted personnel and officers — to provide leadership advice and answer questions. Course topics throughout the day included administrative writing, supervising civilians, manpower management, standards and discipline, building culture, caring for your people, and additional leadership skills.

Stressing the importance of making supervisors’ leadership journey their own, Johnson said, “If you focus on you, what you want out of your experience, you'll be OK … I'm human too, and we're all walking through this together.”

Training course ensures mission readiness of medical personnel

U.S. Air Force leadership emphasized training such as the Frontline Supervisors Course helps to address potential knowledge gaps across leaders in the military.

“We noticed for frontline supervisors, there were certain things that we expect people to know at a specific rank that a lot of times they didn’t know or had not had the training or exposure to,” said Air Force Master Sgt. Chelsie Evangelista, dental flight chief, Bolling Medical Squadron, Joint Base Anacostia-Bolling in Washington, D.C.

Evangelista said ongoing training “isn’t just about checking a box — it’s about staying ready for whatever comes next. We must be able to rely on our frontline supervisors to make informed judgments, respond to crises under pressure, and carry out their objectives. You can’t expect anyone to do well if they don’t have solid foundational and continuous training that reinforces their capabilities and resilience.”

The day also included opportunities to learn from a variety of senior leaders who provided guidance and perspective into their journey at the helm of military health care.

“Our frontline supervisors occupy different lanes and accomplish our mission; it's important that we can have a united front and take pride in our roles as medics, making sure that people are upholding the standards, and then having the necessary tools to be successful,” said Evangelista. “We designed this course to be able to strengthen those capabilities for our frontline supervisors.”

Air Force Senior Airman Isamar Garcia, a mental health technician at Joint Base Anacostia-Bolling, Washington, D.C., said she participated in the course “to prep me for going into that staff sergeant position in the future, and then hopefully leading my flight.”

“Air Force culture is to lead by example, and I hope to follow that tradition,” said Garcia. “Starting as a young airman in leadership positions, we’re trying to raise ready and capable airmen. We're getting ready for the future.”

Continued knowledge sharing and education, Evangelista said, is critical to mission success.

“Mission begins with readiness, and readiness begins with us. Ongoing training isn’t just a professional responsibility; it’s a strategic imperative. The future of health care leadership hinges on our commitment to lifelong learning.”

Positivity and teamwork at the foundation of Johnson’s leadership

With more than 30 years of military service, Johnson provided anecdotes and leadership advice to those senior leaders and frontline supervisors in attendance.

“Today is a good day to have a good day — that’s how I want you to walk in the door every day,” she said to course participants.

She also emphasized the importance of not only having a team behind you, but one that you can trust. “Having that person who can tell you to take a knee or say those uncomfortable things to you when it begins to get a little too personal” is key to success, she added.

“Manage your expectations,” Johnson said. “Just because someone doesn’t do something one way doesn't mean it is wrong. It is just a different way.”

True leaders recognize that they, too, can continue learning, she stressed.

“Knowledge is another essential element to being an effective leader,” Johnson said. “I have a homework folder where if I hear something that I didn't understand what it was, or I don't know something about it — I will.”

Attitude can make or destroy a team’s morale, she added. “The tone of your flight and your organization is heavily dependent on your attitude. If you’re saying something against leadership or policy, that tone will be the tone of your flight or your department. If you're upbeat, you're positive — that’s how your team will behave.”

She stressed that U.S. Air Force medical personnel need these vital skills both in battle and in their dedication of warfighter care. “Air Force medicine exists to project the lethality of the United States Air Force … we must be able to shoot, move, communicate — then medicate.”",https://cdn.dvidshub.net/images/dvids_logo.svg,N,0.0,2025-11-17 12:56:27.508202

When my primary care physician referred me to OB/GYN, the Naval Medical Center exercised right of first refusal. However, because I was hospitalized and needed immediate care and Tricare agreed to change my referral to a civilian OB/GYN who was able to see immediately following the hospital visit. The referral now lists my civilian OB/GYN and seems to be covering the entirety of the prenatal care including hospital delivery and postpartum care. It's open enrollment season, and I'm considering switching to Tricare Select to avoid any potential issues (for example, Tricare refusing to cover hospital expenses because the Naval Medical Center exercised right of first refusal). Tricare claims the current referral is valid, but the Naval Medical Center, upon contacting, claimed that they had the original referral and threatened that Tricare wouldn't cover costs of healthcare if I refused to seek it there. I love my current OB/GYN and don't want to switch my care to another doctor at the Naval facility. I would also prefer to not to switch to Tricare Select at this time because of the potential for extra cost in comparison to Tricare Prime.

Could you please advise what's the approximate difference in cost of hospital delivery (this seems to be the biggest difference) between Tricare Prime and Select? My civilian OB/GYN is affiliated with Scripps Memorial Hospital La Jolla, so I would be giving birth there. The cost of delivery at that facility ranges from $10,000 to $30,000, depending on type of delivery and related complications.

Also, if Tricare were to refuse to cover the costs of Healthcarebecause of failure to seek it at the Naval Medical Center, a valid argument against refusal would be need for the continuity of care, which is an exception to the right of first refusal rule?

Once you start getting your pension (around age 60), you can choose Tricare Prime or Select and the cost is quite reasonable and the same as if you retired from active duty but higher than if you were currently on active duty.

My wife works for a very large healthcare system so we use their (cheap) really good insurance. It just wasn’t worth the hassle with TriCare anymore

But no as a guardsman you don’t need a referral since there are no medical services provided at the base. As long as TriCare is accepted you can just make an appointment anywhere. They might fight you on coverage depending on services, but normal appts should be fine. I will say having both our kids born under TriCare after completing MPA tours was a blessing. I think we only paid about $300 out of pocket for each if even that, and both kids were in the Nicu (only precautionary no real actual issues)

Tricare Reserve Select is not much like Prime (what you have on active duty). You don't see doctors on base. You do not have PCM assigned and you don't need referrals for specialty care. For both primary and most specialty care, you just find an in-network provider and make an appointment.

Whether you're enrolled in TRS doesn't matter for Tricare in Retirement. Tricare Retired Reserve (what you are eligible for while you're in the ""gray area"") is similar to TRS but much, much more expensive.

Except it’s not the end. It’s barely the end of the First Act. Buckle up, buttercup, this blockbuster is showing in homes all around the US of A. Because after the hugs come the hiccups. And the reintegration phase? That’s less Hollywood rom-com and more the “Saw” franchise.

The Fantasy vs. The First Fight

You spent months dreaming of this reunion, planning and plotting, even. They’d walk through the door, and everything would click right back into place. There’d be candles, connection, maybe a celebratory charcuterie board with white wine. Instead, you get: “Why are the knives in a different drawer now, babe?”

Turns out, life kept going while they were gone. You developed systems, survived solo parenting, possibly became fluent in generational culture, or microwaveable meals. Meanwhile, they’ve been living in a world of routine, uniforms, and Meals Ready to Expire (MREs). And now the two of you are trying to merge realities like some Sci-Fi Channel docuseries.

Reintegration: The Remix

There’s a rhythm to solo life. You figure out how to do everything yourself, from bedtime routines to killing spiders with utter confidence (or at least screaming into that vacuum hose with a Viking warrior). Then, suddenly, your partner is back—and so is the negotiation. Who does bedtime now? Are we a “team” again, or do I still lead this household like a stressed-out cruise director? Why are they folding the towels like that? We never fold our towels like that!

Even the intimacy takes a minute. You thought it would be “Fifty Shades of Grey,” but it’s more like a “Band of Brothers” intro. Physically, yes, but emotionally? There’s a hesitancy. You want to pick up where you left off, or shoot for the stars, but there are unspoken miles between you that must be bridged.

Sleep, Sex, and the Silent Treatment

Let’s talk about that first night. You imagine spooning under cozy covers. Instead, you’re jolted awake at 3 a.m. by your partner yelling “Contact left!” in their sleep while flailing like they’re in a tactical burrito.

Time zones, muscle memory, and emotional armor don’t just melt away with a welcome-home cake. And let’s not even get started on the TV remote wars, fridge organization drama, or why the kids are doing push-ups in your living room… and now running laps around the house.

The Little Wins

But then, ever so slowly, there are moments, peaks of sunshine in the overcast clouds. You laugh at a shared joke from three deployments ago. You tag-team a chaotic school morning and high-five like you just won Olympic gold. You finally reconnect—physically and emotionally—and it feels… earned.

You learn each other again. Not who you were, but who you are now. And weirdly, that might be better.

The Long Game

Here’s the truth they don’t put in the reunion videos: reintegration isn’t a week-long vacation. It’s a process. A sometimes clumsy, always evolving, beautifully frustrating process. There might be counseling. There might be silence. There will definitely be a moment when one of you cries into a frozen pizza or dubious leftover Chinese food. But you’re not failing. You’re just adjusting. Together.

So be patient. Give grace. Keep the knives where they are, or move them, just make sure it’s a joint decision this time. Because this messy, beautiful part? It’s where the real story begins.
