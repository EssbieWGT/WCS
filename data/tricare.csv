DENVER, CO / ACCESS Newswire / June 26, 2025 / Hospitals and health systems are facing unprecedented strain from unresolved, complex accounts receivable (AR), particularly in segments involving legal, regulatory, or high-dollar clinical factors. According to Black Book Research's 2025 survey of 902 U.S. provider revenue cycle executives, over 42% of aging AR is now tied to complex claims that require advanced capabilities far beyond standard billing office functions.

""Provider organizations can no longer afford to let complex claims stall in their aging buckets,"" said Doug Brown, Founder of Black Book Research. ""Specialized AR segments demand precise recovery models, policy fluency, and advanced denial intelligence - whether the issue is payer resistance, clinical ambiguity, or legal complexity.""

Ten High-Impact Complex AR Categories in 2025

Workers' Compensation & Third-Party Liability These claims demand extensive legal coordination, state-specific rules adherence, and long-cycle tracking due to employer and insurer documentation requirements. Top Rated Vendor: EnableComp

Veterans Affairs (VA) & TRICARE Providers continue to report operational frustration with federal healthcare programs, including delayed authorizations, inconsistent reimbursement standards, and time-intensive appeals. Top Rated Vendor: EnableComp

Motor Vehicle Accident (MVA) and Personal Injury These claims frequently intersect with ongoing litigation, unclear payer responsibility, and documentation demands that require payer and legal team coordination. Top Rated Vendor: EnableComp

Clinical Denials & Medical Necessity Appeals Claims denied for inpatient status, medical necessity, or DRG assignment have the highest financial exposure. These require clinically credentialed teams and deep payer-specific appeal tactics. Top Rated Vendor: Knowtion Health

Legacy AR and Runoff Accounts Aging AR tied to facility acquisitions, EHR transitions, or defunct cost centers often stagnate unless recovered by firms with reconciliation and platform-agnostic retrieval skills. Top Rated Vendor: XTend Healthcare

High-Balance Self-Pay and Underinsured The rise of high-deductible health plans has pushed significant payment responsibility onto patients. Recovery depends on empathetic, data-driven financial engagement tools. Top Rated Vendor: Cedar

Medicaid and Indigent Care Retroactive eligibility, manual processing, and fragmented state regulations continue to challenge providers attempting to collect from public and indigent payer programs. Top Rated Vendor: XTend Healthcare

International and Cross-Border Claims Payers outside the U.S., including embassies and foreign insurers, add complexity through documentation differences, language barriers, and verification delays. Top Rated Vendor: Nymbl Systems

Out-of-Network and No Authorization Claims These denied claims often require extensive appeal documentation and are prone to long legal or negotiation cycles before partial payments are issued. Top Rated Vendor: Intersect Healthcare

Social Determinants and Care Setting Ambiguity New denial types are emerging around SDoH factors such as housing instability and unclear categorization of care environments (e.g., emergency vs. urgent care). Top Rated Vendor: Socially Determined

Black Book's 18 Universal KPIs for Complex AR Evaluation

Black Book's qualitative KPIs for evaluating complex AR vendors include specialized claim expertise, regulatory knowledge, recovery effectiveness, client responsiveness, and transparent reporting. Key factors also involve accurate payer identification, workflow flexibility, staff credentials, and quality appeal documentation. Additionally, proactive denial management, consistent recoveries, empathetic patient engagement, timely recovery actions, client-specific adaptability, ethical standards, negotiation effectiveness, and strong client retention rates are critical components.

""These indicators provide the foundation for selecting and retaining the right vendors to manage the revenue that too often gets written off,"" Brown added.

That 50% you're thinking of isn't with Select, that's Prime POS benefits.

If you’re not on a base, get select. I was on prime and ran into some vision-threatening issues and getting referrals and authorizations from a a civilian PCM when you need urgent speciality care is added stress you don’t need. I needed a referral from my PCM to go to the optometrist and get my initial referral to ophthalmology. I’d rather jsut pay the $32 to go see ophthalmology on my own vs going through hoops to get a $0 visit

I don’t pay anywhere near 50%. I don’t pay anywhere near 20%. I’ve been on Select for 20 years. It’s the absolute best. There’s so much freedom with it. I think the most I pay as a copay is for my medication, which is brand name and costs thousands of dollars retail, and I pay around $119. But pre-2021, I paid like $15. So thanks for that, capitalism.

Imo, it’s so worth it. You don’t need referrals for insurance, and any referrals you do get because of office preference don’t expire. You can go to any doctor. Even if they’re not in network and bill Tricare, they’ll still get paid. I honestly think it’s the best in the country.

The only downside is that you can’t use it on a military installation outside of the pharmacy and emergency room. So if you want to see, say, a cardiologist, you can’t use one on the installation. You have to use civilian. That part sucks if you’re in a pinch or in a healthcare desert like I am, but in the long run it’s still better. And in your area, I’m sure most docs will take it.

With rising awareness of mental health care and its importance, insurance coverage is a critical concern for many families and individuals.

In this blog, North Penn Now will review how insurance works in the Idaho rehab context, explore coverage specifics—including Tricare—and clarify your options so you feel empowered to make an informed decision.

Understanding Insurance and Rehab Coverage in Idaho

Insurance policies vary widely, from private commercial plans to government-sponsored programs and military benefits like Tricare. Understanding how these systems intersect with rehab services is key.

Rehab centers in Idaho may offer inpatient residential programs, outpatient services, medication-assisted treatment, dual-diagnosis care, and more. Some even offer treatment plans customized to address specific challenges. Each type of treatment may or may not be covered differently under insurance plans.

In-Network vs. Out-of-Network Providers

First, it's essential to check whether a treatment center is considered in‑network or out‑of‑network. In‑network means the rehab center has a contract with your insurance company, offering negotiated rates that usually minimize your out‑of‑pocket costs.

Out‑of‑network providers don’t have such agreements, meaning coverage may still be available but typically involves higher deductibles, co‑pays, or coinsurance. Many Idaho rehabs—especially the most reputable ones—work with major insurance carriers to be in-network, though availability can differ by region and by facility.

Private Insurance Plans

If you or someone in your family has a private health plan—through an employer or purchased individually—be sure to contact the insurer directly. Ask whether substance use treatment is a covered benefit, and if so, what specific levels of care are included (such as detox, residential, outpatient, or aftercare).

While federal parity laws require most health plans to provide equal financial coverage for mental health and substance use treatment as physical health, certain limits (like length of stay) may still apply.

Some rehab centers in Idaho have dedicated staff to help verify benefits and coordinate pre-authorizations for you.

Medicaid Coverage in Idaho

Idaho’s Medicaid program does cover substance use treatment, though the scope can vary depending on eligibility category. Some individuals qualify through traditional Medicaid, while others may access coverage through expansion categories such as those first-time enrollees under the Affordable Care Act.

Many Idaho rehabs are part of the Medicaid network and able to provide services like outpatient counseling, partial hospitalization programs (PHP), and residential treatment. It’s important to confirm if a facility meets Medicaid requirements, including licensure and acceptance of managed care plans.

Medicare and Older Adults

For people over 65 or those with qualifying disabilities, Medicare may help cover rehab services. However, Medicare’s coverage of inpatient rehab is more limited. While it covers hospital-level psychiatric care, skilled nursing stays, and Medicare-certified outpatient programs, standalone substance use disorder treatment programs may not always qualify.

Therefore, facilities that participate in Medicare may offer some covered services but not others. Idaho residents with Medicare are encouraged to work with rehab intake staff or a case manager to understand what’s included.

Spotlight on Tricare Coverage

Tricare serves active-duty military, National Guard, Reservists, and their families, as well as some veterans under the age of 65. When asking whether top rehabs in Idaho accept insurance, it’s vital to consider military benefits as well.

Tricare covers mental health and substance use treatment, including inpatient rehab, outpatient therapy, and residential care in community-based facilities that meet specific criteria.

How Tricare Works with Rehab Centers

Rehab centers seeking Tricare reimbursement must obtain proper credentials and become authorized providers. Many accredited treatment centers in Idaho—especially those known for excellence—do seek Tricare approval to accommodate military families.

Coverage levels might vary between Tricare Prime, Select, or overseas plans. In general, Tricare Prime requires referral and pre-approval, while Tricare Select allows more flexibility with out-of-network providers, albeit with higher cost-sharing.

Always check with both the rehab center and your regional Tricare contractor to confirm prior authorization requirements and cost estimates.

Copay, Deductible, and Cost-sharing

For Tricare Prime users, inpatient rehab often has minimal or no copays if referred through a military treatment facility (MTF). Support services and therapy sessions under outpatient care are subject to fixed copays depending on the plan type.

Under Tricare Select, coverage levels are similar to civilian PPO plans: plans may cover 70‑80% of cost for authorized treatment, with beneficiaries responsible for deductibles and cost-shares. That means finding a Tricare‑authorized facility within Idaho is crucial to minimizing out‑of‑pocket expenses.

Idaho’s Top Rehabs and Insurance Compatibility

Rehab facilities in Idaho range from large, accredited centers offering comprehensive programming to smaller, boutique-style treatment homes. Let’s look at how most of the leading facilities navigate insurance and Tricare coverage.

Academic and Hospital-Affiliated Programs

Facilities associated with universities or hospitals often have robust insurance infrastructure. These programs usually accept a broad mix of commercial plans, Medicaid, Tricare, and sometimes Medicare.

Their billing departments can pre‑verify insurance benefits and guide families through claims. They also tend to be early adopters of behavioral-health parity compliance and stay current on Tricare credentialing processes.

Private Residential and Holistic Centers

Many privately owned residential centers in Idaho work actively to become in‑network providers for major insurance carriers, including Tricare. These Tricare centers offer detox along with group and individual therapy, family counseling, and dual‑diagnosis care.

Some have dedicated liaisons who verify whether clients are covered under commercial insurance, Medicaid expansion, or Tricare and help arrange preauthorization. That said, coverage depends on facility accreditation, staff credentials, and the specific treatment services offered.

Outpatient and Intensive Outpatient Programs

For those not needing residential care, Idaho offers a wide array of outpatient treatment programs. These may include outpatient counseling and intensive outpatient treatment (IOP).

Outpatient care tends to be more consistently covered by insurance plans, including commercial, Medicaid, Medicare, and Tricare, because the costs are lower and the care is time-limited. These programs are often ideal for working adults or those with family obligations.

Telehealth and Virtual Care

Telehealth has grown tremendously, and insurance plans—including Tricare—cover these services, especially since the COVID-19 pandemic. Many Idaho providers now include virtual counseling sessions and group therapy components.

Coverage for virtual rehab services can be as extensive as for in-person formats, though it varies by insurer and plan type. Telehealth can offer significant convenience, particularly for rural areas without easy access to in-person centers.

Steps to Confirm Insurance Coverage for Rehab

Whether you're exploring options for yourself or someone you care about, there are action steps you can take to clarify coverage:

Check Your Insurance Plan Documents

Begin with your member handbook, policy summary, or online portal. Look under categories like 'Substance Use Disorder (SUD)', ‘Behavioral Health’, or ‘Mental Health and Addictions Treatment’. Confirm what services are covered, what the cost-sharing structure looks like, and whether reference to specific facility networks is provided.

Contact Insurance Provider Customer Service

Directly call the phone number on your insurance card. Use this to:

Confirm whether rehab benefits apply

Learn about inpatient versus outpatient coverage

Ask about length-of-stay limits or service caps

Request a list of in‑network treatment centers, including Tricare-authorized

Make note of the representative’s name and any reference numbers if they issue you a confirmation or eligibility number.

Reach Out to Rehab Centers Early

Quality treatment centers in Idaho often help by reviewing your insurance benefits with you. They’ll ask for your subscriber information, plan number, and group policy ID, then talk to your insurer to confirm authorization.

They can estimate your financial responsibility and outline any documentation needed for claims. If they don’t handle this for you, ask if they can refer you to a third‑party verification company.

Plan for Out-of-Network or Self-Pay Options

If your preferred rehab center isn’t in-network, you may still access services. Some have sliding-scale rates or payment plans. Rehabilitation stays can also be reimbursed post-treatment, depending on your policy.

Always ask for an itemized bill and take advantage of any out-of-network reimbursement benefits.

Get Started on a Stable Path to Recovery in Idaho

So, do the top rehabs in Idaho accept insurance to cover treatment costs? The answer is yes—most reputable and accredited treatment programs in the state do work directly with major insurances, Medicaid, Medicare, and military plans like Tricare.

But coverage levels, authorizations, and your out-of-pocket responsibility depend on your plan type, the facility’s provider status, and the level of treatment you need.

If you or your loved one is exploring rehab options in Idaho, take these steps: verify your plan benefits early, confirm the rehab’s in-network status (especially with Tricare if applicable), ask about pre-authorizations and length-of-stay limitations, and map out your full continuum of care, including aftercare and therapy. With clarity and advocacy, you can reduce financial stress and focus on what matters most—recovery and healing.

Idaho offers excellent treatment resources, and many centers go above and beyond to simplify the insurance process. Taking proactive steps early ensures the only thing you worry about is getting healthy.",,N,0.0,2025-06-26 18:56:34.181254

WHAT YOU NEED TO KNOW: The TRICARE referral and authorization waiver for the West Region will expire on June 30. After that date, providers must follow standard TRICARE requirements for all new outpatient services.

The U.S. Defense Health Agency has confirmed that the temporary waiver of referral and authorization requirements for TRICARE Prime beneficiaries in the West Region will end on June 30, 2025. Beginning July 1, 2025, all outpatient services for TRICARE Prime patients will once again require appropriate referrals and authorizations in accordance with standard TRICARE guidelines.

The waiver was initially enacted to ease administrative burdens during the transition of managed care responsibilities to TriWest Healthcare Alliance (TriWest), which assumed management of TRICARE West Region services on January 1, 2025. Under the waiver, providers did not need to submit referral or authorization requests for TRICARE Prime patients seeking TRICARE-covered outpatient services, with some exceptions.

Referrals for care that extends beyond June 30, 2025, will need to follow the prior established TRICARE referral and authorization requirements and obtain approval to continue care after June 30. Referrals issued after June 30, 2025, will be subject to normal TRICARE referral and authorization requirements.

Providers are strongly encouraged to review the TriWest TRICARE Provider Handbook and referral protocols to avoid disruptions in care or reimbursement issues starting July 1.

Source: Black Book Research","Hospitals and health systems are facing unprecedented strain from unresolved, complex accounts receivable (AR), particularly in segments involving legal, regulatory, or high-dollar clinical factors. According to Black Book Research's 2025 survey of 902 U.S. provider revenue cycle executives, over 42% of aging AR is now tied to complex claims that require advanced capabilities far beyond standard billing office functions.

""Provider organizations can no longer afford to let complex claims stall in their aging buckets,"" said Doug Brown, Founder of Black Book Research. ""Specialized AR segments demand precise recovery models, policy fluency, and advanced denial intelligence - whether the issue is payer resistance, clinical ambiguity, or legal complexity.""

Ten High-Impact Complex AR Categories in 2025

Workers' Compensation & Third-Party Liability These claims demand extensive legal coordination, state-specific rules adherence, and long-cycle tracking due to employer and insurer documentation requirements. Top Rated Vendor: EnableComp

Veterans Affairs (VA) & TRICARE Providers continue to report operational frustration with federal healthcare programs, including delayed authorizations, inconsistent reimbursement standards, and time-intensive appeals. Top Rated Vendor: EnableComp

Motor Vehicle Accident (MVA) and Personal Injury These claims frequently intersect with ongoing litigation, unclear payer responsibility, and documentation demands that require payer and legal team coordination. Top Rated Vendor: EnableComp

Clinical Denials & Medical Necessity Appeals Claims denied for inpatient status, medical necessity, or DRG assignment have the highest financial exposure. These require clinically credentialed teams and deep payer-specific appeal tactics. Top Rated Vendor: Knowtion Health

Legacy AR and Runoff Accounts Aging AR tied to facility acquisitions, EHR transitions, or defunct cost centers often stagnate unless recovered by firms with reconciliation and platform-agnostic retrieval skills. Top Rated Vendor: XTend Healthcare

High-Balance Self-Pay and Underinsured The rise of high-deductible health plans has pushed significant payment responsibility onto patients. Recovery depends on empathetic, data-driven financial engagement tools. Top Rated Vendor: Cedar

Medicaid and Indigent Care Retroactive eligibility, manual processing, and fragmented state regulations continue to challenge providers attempting to collect from public and indigent payer programs. Top Rated Vendor: XTend Healthcare

International and Cross-Border Claims Payers outside the U.S., including embassies and foreign insurers, add complexity through documentation differences, language barriers, and verification delays. Top Rated Vendor: Nymbl Systems

Out-of-Network and No Authorization Claims These denied claims often require extensive appeal documentation and are prone to long legal or negotiation cycles before partial payments are issued. Top Rated Vendor: Intersect Healthcare

Social Determinants and Care Setting Ambiguity New denial types are emerging around SDoH factors such as housing instability and unclear categorization of care environments (e.g., emergency vs. urgent care). Top Rated Vendor: Socially Determined

Black Book's 18 Universal KPIs for Complex AR Evaluation

Black Book's qualitative KPIs for evaluating complex AR vendors include specialized claim expertise, regulatory knowledge, recovery effectiveness, client responsiveness, and transparent reporting. Key factors also involve accurate payer identification, workflow flexibility, staff credentials, and quality appeal documentation. Additionally, proactive denial management, consistent recoveries, empathetic patient engagement, timely recovery actions, client-specific adaptability, ethical standards, negotiation effectiveness, and strong client retention rates are critical components.

""These indicators provide the foundation for selecting and retaining the right vendors to manage the revenue that too often gets written off,"" Brown added.

“Together, the DOD and VA aim for adaptable, transparent, consistent, high-quality health care that encourages shared decision-making with patients and clinicians.","Department of Defense and Department of Veterans Affairs clinical practice guidelines aim to provide the most recent and accurate evidence-based information to DOD and VA providers.

• For providers, CPGs give them the information needed to diagnose and treat particular medical conditions that may show up in the patient populations they serve.

• For patients, CPGs give them current, understandable information needed to make decisions about their health care.

Researchers have published 28 Clinical Practice Guidelines to date. VA and DOD experts create, maintain, and periodically update these CPGs as new evidence-based research emerges and further advancements in medicine evolve, covering diverse topics.

“The hardest part is keeping up with the advancement in medicine and educating the field and maintaining a standardized approach in the continuum of care for military and veteran communities across both health systems,” said Jenifer Meno, who holds a doctorate of nursing practices, and is the Defense Health Agency deputy chief, Clinical Quality Improvement Program, Medical Affairs/Clinical Support Division.

The multifaceted guidelines “are used globally and liked for their rigor in the systematic review of the literature,” said Meno. She emphasized how the care workflow of each CPG is easy to follow for clinicians and provides clinical support tools that assist with applying the recommendations that support both clinician and patients in shared decision-making.

The CPGs also offer clinical support tools that care teams can use for patient education and provider support. These tools include pocket guides, links to videos, and publications, said Meno.

In the 1990’s, the VA solely published documents similar to today’s CPGs. The Military Health System began planning and implementing broad-scale healthcare reform initiatives in response to the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2017 and additional guidance that followed in the NDAAs for fiscal years 2018–2020.

The current VA-DOD CPG partnership issued its first jointly developed guideline, Management of Posttraumatic Stress Disorder, in 2004. The partnership published three updates on this topic, with the latest in 2023.

So far in 2025, the partnership has published CPGs including:

• Rehabilitation of Lower Limb Amputation on Jan. 13, 2025

• Management of Chronic insomnia Disorder and Obstructive Sleep Apnea on Feb. 26, 2025

• Primary Care Management of Asthma on March 26, 2025

• Primary Care Management of Chronic Kidney Disease on May 16, 2025.

What’s Next

Several new or updated CPGs are currently being developed, including:

• Diagnosis and Management of Hypertension, projected release August 2026

• Management of Adult Obesity and Overweight, projected release August 2025

• Management of Dyslipidemia, projected release September 2025

• Tobacco Cessation, projected release March 2026

• Nonsurgical Management of Hip and Knee Osteoarthritis, projected release May 2026

• Pressure Injury Prevention (bed sores), projected release June 2026

• Menopause Management, projected release August 2026

The CPGs dealing with obesity and overweight will align with Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth’s March 12, 2025, directive requiring service members to remain physically fit to keep U.S. forces in peak condition and readiness.

Key Aspects of VA-DOD CPGs

Each CPG promotes evidence-based practice, optimizes patient outcomes, and reduces inappropriate variations in care. Each CPG includes:

• Systematic reviews of clinical and disease prevention and protection evidence

• Multidisciplinary and expert medical and scientific input

• Critical decision points and the rationale behind them

• Regular updates based on new evidence and best practices

Writing a Value-based CPG

Together, the DOD and VA create and monitor the CPGs for value and effectiveness. A new or updated CPG can take 18 to 24 months to develop and get published, Meno said.

The VA-DOD Health Executive Committee chartered the VA-DOD Evidence-Based Practice Working Group in 2003. The group is comprised of volunteer DOD and VA multi-disciplinary clinicians providing a holistic view of care. Four to five new CPGs are considered by the group each year and the schedule for fiscal year development and updates is set by the group, Meno said.

According to a Jan. 24, 2024, information paper on CPG development by the DHA’s Clinical Quality Improvement Program, existing CPGs are looked at first by the group, especially those where meaningful advancements have been made in science, and then older CPGs are looked at for a possible refresh.

Next, the VA and DOD put together a VA-DOD CPG working group. The VA and the DOD each recruit two champions and eight clinicians from many healthcare disciplines, who they strictly vet for their expertise and lack of any conflicts of interest.

Key Questions and Recommendations Development

The CPG working group schedules a kickoff meeting, followed later in the process by a recommendation development meeting. The DOD and VA also sponsor patient focus groups to understand what matters most to patients and their caregivers.

At kickoff, the subject matter experts define the target patient population and medical audiences for the guideline. They create a large set of key questions to guide literature searches and evidence reviews.

According to Meno, the recommendation development team conducts a multi-day event that seeks to answer whether the recommendations based on the key questions are actionable—Do they work? And, how strong is the scientific evidence?

For a new CPG, the group develops key questions from the ground up. For updates to existing guidelines, the group determines if the CPG aligns with current best practices. The group may also create a new set of key questions.

The team writes three drafts. The reviewers send the third draft for outside peer review, after which the VA-DOD Evidence-Based Working Group receives the final guideline for decision. Once the members approve a CPG, the team creates provider and patient clinical support tools, such as pocket and patient guides. The team publishes approved CPGs and clinical support tools on DHA and VA websites.

“Together, the DOD and VA aim for adaptable, transparent, consistent, high-quality health care that encourages shared decision-making with patients and clinicians. This improves clinical outcomes and patient satisfaction while reducing the potential for harm and optimizing the use of resources,” Meno said.",https://d1ldvf68ux039x.cloudfront.net/thumbs/photos/2406/8480045/1000w_q95.jpg,N,0.0,2025-06-26 15:56:27.227798

Master Sgt. Aaron Bell, 97th Logistics Readiness Squadron vehicle fleet manager, and Staff Sgt. Jack Brown, 97th Healthcare Operations Squadron TRICARE operations and patient administration non-commissioned officer in charge, were chosen among thousands of Airmen across the Air Force to represent their base and career fields at this elite level.

“Having two people from the same base compete at this level, I’ve never heard of it before,” said Brown. “I’ve spoken to several leaders across the base, and they’ve never seen this since they’ve been in.”

The Air Force OAY Program recognizes nine enlisted members based on their prior year’s performance, based on exceptional job performance in their primary duty, superior leadership, followership, and the epitome of the whole airman concept.

Both Airmen were nominated after winning at the wing and numbered air force level, attributing their success to being a part of effective teams that lifted both of them up to this opportunity. This sentiment was captured by Bell, crediting the source of his victory.

“I feel like I’m representing everyone,” said Bell. “I have a lot of supervisors in the past and present, teammates, mentors, troops, that poured into me and contributed to this.”

Bell also highlighted the responsibility to represent his unit as an, ""obligation to put the best foot forward.” Stressing the importance of investing in personal development, advising younger Airmen to lay strong foundations early in their careers.

“Having your degree gives you more opportunities to serve in special roles,” said Bell. “Getting my Community College of the Air Force degree early allowed me to get selected for a professional military education to become an Airman Leadership School instructor.”

The competition for the award will begin on June 29, 2025, with a professional development course, followed by an assessment board, and concluding with the final selection process.

Unlock your health by signing up for Medicare as soon as you’re eligible. Medicare Part A and Part B are required to remain eligible for TRICARE, with limited exceptions. Knowing how and when to sign up for Medicare will help you avoid gaps in coverage and late enrollment penalties.

“Signing up for Medicare three or four months before your 65th birthday is important to ensure a seamless transition to TRICARE For Life,” said Anne Breslin, TFL program manager, TRICARE Health Plan, at the Defense Health Agency. “Medicare and TRICARE will then work together to help minimize your out-of-pocket expenses.”

Understanding eligibility

Most people become eligible for Medicare the first day of the month they turn 65. Those with a birthday on the first of a month become eligible the first of the month before they turn 65.

Some become eligible for Medicare before age 65 after receiving Social Security Disability Insurance for 24 months or when diagnosed with certain medical conditions.

TFL is available to military retirees and their family members who qualify for TRICARE, are entitled to Medicare Part A, and have Medicare Part B, regardless of age or place of residence. You can sign up on the Social Security Administration website or by calling SSA to schedule an appointment.

Learn more by reading the TRICARE and Medicare Under Age 65 Brochure.

If you (or your spouse) are still working and have employer-sponsored health coverage when you turn 65, Medicare allows you to delay enrollment in Medicare Part B. But if you do delay enrollment, you won’t have TRICARE coverage. Answer a few questions on the Medicare webpage to find out what’s right for you.

If one family member becomes eligible for Medicare and is now covered by TFL, other family members not yet eligible for Medicare can still use TRICARE Prime or TRICARE Select.

Avoid penalties

It’s important to sign up for Medicare Part A and Part B during your Initial Enrollment Period, which is seven months long. This is when you’re first eligible to sign up for Medicare Part A and Part B. It starts three or four months before you turn 65. Learn more about late enrollment penalties and how to avoid them.

To avoid coverage gaps, keep your information current in the Defense Enrollment Eligibility System. This ensures you receive timely updates and benefits information.

Sign up for Medicare no later than two months before the month you turn 65 to avoid a break in your TRICARE coverage. There are no enrollment forms or fees required for TFL —it begins automatically the first date Medicare Part A and Part B are effective.

To learn more, check out the TRICARE and Medicare Turning Age 65 Brochure.

What parts of Medicare do you need?

To be eligible for TFL, you must have both Medicare Part A and Part B.

Part A typically covers:

Inpatient hospital care

Skilled nursing facilities

Hospice

Some home health care

Most people get Part A premium-free if they, or their spouse, worked and paid Social Security taxes for at least 10 years.

Medicare Part B covers:

Outpatient care

Certain preventive services

Durable medical equipment

Part B has a monthly premium based on your income.

You don’t need to enroll in Medicare Advantage (Part C) or prescription drug coverage (Part D) to have TFL coverage. Read the TRICARE Newsroom article “Q&A: How Does TRICARE For Life Work With Medicare?” to learn more.

For dental and vision coverage, check to see if you qualify through the Federal Employees Dental and Vision Insurance Program.

Coverage overseas

Medicare only provides coverage in the U.S. and U.S. territories. If you live or travel overseas, TRICARE becomes your primary payer. That means you’ll pay TRICARE’s annual deductible and cost for care abroad. You must still have Medicare Part B to remain eligible for TFL, even though it doesn’t pay for care.

Here’s what else to keep in mind if you have TFL and live or travel overseas:

You may visit any TRICARE-authorized provider for care.

If you’re in the Philippines, you must see a Philippine Preferred Provider Network or certified providers.

Be prepared to pay for services up front. You’ll need to file a claim later.

You have up to three years to file claims for overseas care.

Which pays first: Medicare or TRICARE?

When both Medicare and TRICARE cover a health care service, Medicare pays first, and TRICARE pays second. TRICARE may also cover services that Medicare doesn’t. That’s why it’s important to confirm you’re covered by Medicare, TRICARE, or both — to help avoid costs.

You’ll also need to use Medicare providers. Check out TRICARE’s covered services to learn more.

Coordination with other health insurance

Other health insurance, or OHI, is coverage in addition to Medicare and TFL. This might be offered by an employer, based on current employment or retirement for you or your spouse.

How Medicare coordinates with OHI depends on whether the OHI is based on current employment. In either case, TRICARE pays last.

Gray replaces Army Col. Lee Freeman, who says William Beaumont Army Medical Center has facility problems.

Col. Gray is 35-year Army veteran with extensive leadership experience.

Army Col. Wendy Gray has become the third woman and 45th Army officer to command the William Beaumont Army Medical Center at Fort Bliss.

Gray, 54, a nurse, has held numerous leadership jobs in her 35-year Army career, including commander of two Army health centers, or medical clinics.

She took control of Beaumont, a more than 100-year-old institution, during a change-of-command ceremony Wednesday, June 25, inside the mammoth medical complex in East El Paso.

""Two words describe how I feel joining the William Beaumont team: Humbled and honored,” Gray said to Army and community dignitaries assembled in the medical complex's cafeteria. The ceremony was livestreamed on Facebook.

New Beaumont commander moves from San Antonio

Gray is moving from San Antonio, where for a year, she was chief of staff for the Army Medical Readiness Command West. It oversees eight Army hospitals, including Beaumont, and three Army health centers in several states.

She takes over for Army Col. Lee Freeman. He’s moving to the Defense Health Agency headquarters in the Washington, D.C., area, where he will be deputy chief of the Army Medical Services Corps.

The Army usually changes the Beaumont commander every two years.

Outgoing commander notes Beaumont facility problems

At the command-change ceremony, Freeman rattled off a list of Beaumont accomplishments during his two-year tenure, including trauma center reaccreditation, increasing hospital capacity for mental health patients, continued progress in operating rooms' utilization, opening of the stand-alone Intrepid Spirit Center to treat traumatic brain injuries, and the continued transition into the almost four-year-old Beaumont campus, with facility problems.

“This is a state-of-the-art, world-class, military medical center,” Freeman said. But, it’s also a “work in progress, when it comes to the facility, and some of the (facility) challenges that it’s facing,” he said.

During Feeman’s tenure, the hospital had two major water pipe breaks that caused flooding and damage in October 2024 and March 2025.

Prior to his command, Beaumont’s water system was shut down for about a month in 2022 because of a water-valve failure, causing the system to be contaminated with sediment.

The six-building medical complex, anchored by the 135-bed Beaumont hospital, also includes clinics and other facilities.

Construction of the $1.5 billion complex was plagued by years of delays and cost overruns. The new hospital opened July 11, 2021.

Beaumont complex has 4,000-person staff

The Beaumont commander oversees the complex, with about 4,000 employees, including about 1,500 military personnel, and an annual budget of about $370 million.

Besides facility challenges, the Beaumont commander also has to deal with frequent hiring freezes and budget constraints, Freeman said.

“So, the current and future environment is one of continued challenges,” Freeman said. “It’s not going to be easy.”

Col. Gray will 'run to the sound of the gun'

Army Brig. Gen. Yolonda “YR” Summons, commander of Medical Readiness Command West, where Gray was chief of staff, said Gray is up to the challenges.

“You’re getting someone who listens deeply, who’s present, who acts decisively, and will always run to the sound of the gun, and (be) an umbrella for when times get tough,” Summons said.

Gray is not only a leader, but also a clinician, Summons said.

Gray started her Army career as a combat medic and later became a nurse and officer in the Army Nurse Corps. She has a master’s degree in nursing as a family nurse practitioner and also is qualified as an aviation flight nurse practitioner.

“She understands the business, of not only Army medicine as it relates to (combat) readiness, but also the Defense Health Agency as it relates to the business of health care,” Summons said.

Gray called Beaumont “a remarkable organization led by dedicated professionals providing top-tier medical care to over 65,000 (military) beneficiaries.”

“I look forward to building on this proud legacy. A cornerstone of military medicine and soldier readiness,” she said.

Gray is married to retired Army First Sgt. Lomack Gray Jr. Their daughter, Taylor Gray, is an Army lieutenant.

Chad Monroe stands accused of conspiracy to commit healthcare fraud and mail fraud, soliciting and receiving healthcare kickbacks, mail fraud, wire fraud, and conspiracy to defraud the United States.

The charges stem from an alleged scheme whereby Monroe and several co-conspirators submitted fake claims to Medicare and TRICARE for medical devices and genetic testing.

A grand jury indictment alleges that Monroe and others created multiple companies while deliberately hiding Monroe's involvement, managerial control, and ownership interest from federal agencies.

Through these companies, Monroe and his co-conspirators allegedly offered kickbacks and bribes to telemedicine companies to have them issue doctor's orders for durable medical equipment – items including orthotics, walkers, canes, etc. The kickbacks, prosecutors say, were concealed via “sham contracts” and “fraudulent invoices” meant to give the veneer of legitimacy to the transfers of funds.

In addition to the fraudulent orders for equipment which were then submitted to Medicare and TRICARE for reimbursement, Monroe also ordered swab kits for genetic testing through similar means, the indictment alleges.

In total, Monroe and others are said to have submitted over $26.5 million in false claims to Medicare, Medicare Advantage plans, and TRICARE, and received over $11 million in reimbursement. Prosecutors say that they also received at least $15 million in bribes and kickbacks from other conspirators for referrals, swab kits, and orders for genetic testing.

The warrant for Monroe's arrest was issued on Monday and was received by territorial authorities on Wednesday, the same day of his arrest. He appeared before U.S. Magistrate Alan Teague that day, and the judge ordered him released on a personal surety bond of $4 million, with 10% payable in cash.

The world of ketogenic dieting has opened new avenues for people seeking ways to enhance their health, manage weight, and improve overall wellness. As the keto lifestyle has gained popularity, so has the importance of monitoring one’s ketone levels. Ketones are substances produced by the liver when the body breaks down fat for energy instead of carbohydrates. They are an essential indicator of whether the body is in a state of ketosis, which is the goal of many following a ketogenic diet. To ensure accurate readings of these important metabolites, devices like the Keto Mojo have become essential tools for practitioners and dieters alike. However, to ensure these devices provide precise measurements, regular calibration is necessary. Calibration is the process of adjusting the device to guarantee that the readings it provides are accurate, reliable, and trustworthy.

Keto Mojo is a popular and user-friendly blood ketone and glucose testing system that allows individuals to monitor their ketogenic journey effectively. The device offers an easy way to check blood ketone levels using a simple finger-prick method, giving insights into whether you are in ketosis. This continuous monitoring is crucial not only for achieving weight loss goals but also for maintaining energy levels and optimizing overall health while in ketosis. However, if the device is not calibrated correctly, the readings could be misleading, leading to improper dietary choices. Therefore, understanding how to calibrate the Keto Mojo is vital for anyone seriously undertaking a ketogenic lifestyle.

Calibration of this device is not a complicated process, and it can be completed in just three straightforward steps. By adhering to these steps, you can ensure your Keto Mojo provides accurate readings every single time. The importance of calibration goes beyond just getting a correct reading; it influences your day-to-day dietary decisions and helps you understand how your body responds to the ketogenic diet accurately. Without a properly calibrated device, you risk turning your

weight loss effort into an exercise of frustration, resulting in potential ketosis miscalculations and misguided choices. This article delves into the detailed process of calibrating your Keto Mojo, emphasizing the importance of accuracy in ketone testing and providing you with the knowledge to ensure you remain on track with your ketogenic health goals.

Keto Low Carb Crackers Step One: Gather Necessary Supplies

The first step in properly calibrating your Keto Mojo is to gather all the necessary supplies. Calibration requires a few essential components that are integral to ensuring the accuracy of your readings. You will need a working Keto Mojo device, calibration solution, clean strips, and a stable environment for undertaking the calibration. The calibration solution is particularly crucial, as it contains a known concentration of ketones that allows the device to adjust its readings accurately. Ensure that your calibration solution is within its expiration date to avoid any discrepancies in measurements.

Clean strips are another essential component that ensures you get an accurate blood reading. Make sure you are also using high-quality test strips specifically designed for use with the Keto Mojo device. Using outdated or unsupported strips may lead to variances in your test results. A clean and stable environment is required to avoid any external factors that could affect your calibration process. You want to ensure that you are not in a place with extreme temperatures or humidity, which can impact readings. A quiet and distraction-free atmosphere will help you concentrate on the calibration process, increasing your likelihood of success.

Once you’ve gathered your supplies, familiarize yourself with your Keto Mojo device. Review the user manual for any specific calibration instructions that may be unique to your model. Understanding your device’s features, functionality, and maintenance requirements can help you have a smoother calibration experience. It is equally important to ensure that the device’s software is updated and functioning properly, as this could affect its calibr

ation capacity. With your supplies at hand and an understanding of your device in mind, you are well-prepared to move to the next step of the calibration process.

Gifts For Someone On A Keto Diet Step Two: Preparing for Calibration

<pPreparation is key to successful calibration. Before you begin the actual calibration process, make sure that your hands are clean and dry. Any residual substances can potentially interfere with test readings, so thoroughly wash and dry your hands before handling the Keto Mojo device or test strips. It’s also recommended to use the calibration solution at room temperature to ensure it provides the most accurate readings possible. Handling the calibration solution without contaminating it is crucial; avoid touching the nozzle or the tip of the container.

<pNext, set the calibration solution alongside your Keto Mojo and the test strips on a flat, stable surface. Ensure that there is ample lighting, so you can clearly read the screen of your device during the calibration process. Clear your mind of distractions, as focusing on the calibration steps will enhance accuracy and predictability. As you begin the calibration procedure, take it one step at a time, paying close attention to the prompts on the device's scr

een. Read through the instructions thoroughly before starting, ensuring you understand what to expect before proceeding.

<pAnother important aspect of the preparation phase is timing. Choosing a specific time during the day when you can calibrate without interruptions will help create a routine for accuracy. Consider scheduling calibration at intervals that don’t interfere with your regular testing routine, perhaps when you would typically measure ketone levels. This way, calibration becomes part of your regular monitoring process, leading to consistent accuracy. With preparation complete, you are ready to embark on the third step of the calibration process to ensure your Keto Mojo provides accurate readings.

Step Three: Performing the Calibration Clean Eating Recipes For Weight Loss

<pNow you are ready to perform the actual calibration of your Keto Mojo device. Insert a clean test strip into the device, making sure it is seated properly. Once the strip is firmly in place, the device should power on automatically. Follow the prompts on the screen, which may instruct you to apply the calibration solution directly to the test strip. Make sure to use the appropriate amount of calibration solution as indicated on the screen. Typically, a small drop is sufficient, but refer to your device guide for specifics.

<pOnce the calibration solution is applied, the device will start processing the information. This step could take a few seconds, during which you should refrain from touching the device or the calibration solution. After the calibration process is complete, the Keto Mojo should display a reading based on the calibration solution used. Verify that this reading falls within the expected range outlined in your user manual. If the reading is outside of this range or is otherwise inconsistent with what you anticipated, repeat the calibration steps, using a new test strip and a fresh sample of the calibration solution.

<pNever rush the calibration process to save time. Ensuring the accuracy and reliability of your readings is soberly vital to your health and dietary goals. Once calibration is complete and the readings are as expected, dispose of the calibration solution properly, and ensure that your Keto Mojo and work area are clean before storing your device back in a safe, cool, and dry location. Performing the calibration correctly will guarantee you a reliable partner in your ketogenic journey as you continue to monitor your success.

Best Keto Acv Gummies On The Market Common Challenges and Troubleshooting Tips

<pEven with the best preparation and intentions, issues can arise during the calibration process, leading to inaccurate readings or frustration. One of the most common challenges users experience is variability in readings after calibration. If you notice fluctuations in readings, it might indicate that the test strips or calibration solution is faulty or expired. Always check the expiration dates on these components before initiating a calibration to avoid unnecessary confusion.

<pAnother challenge is incorrect application of the calibration solution. Be sure to carefully apply it directly to the test strip; any residuals on your fingers or on the device could affect the outcome. If you suspect this was the case, repeat the calibration procedure with clean hands and fresh components. Additionally, unexpected readings could also be a sign of a malfunctioning device. In this case, consult the user manual for troubleshooting guidance or contact customer support for assistance.

<pLastly, it might happen that your device requires numerous calibration attempts before you achieve consistency. If this is the case, take a moment to pause and troubleshoot. Inspect for any signs of damage to the device or the test strip. Clean the contact points of the device, and recheck for software updates that may provide better calibration results. Consistent monitoring and maintenance of the device will not only enhance its longevity but also improve reading accuracy long-term.

Keto Mcdonalds Chicken Nuggets Frequently Asked Questions About Keto Mojo Calibration

<pAs with any technological device, users often have questions regarding the calibration process, its significance, and general ketone testing. One common question is, “How often should I calibrate my Keto Mojo?” It is generally recommended to calibrate the device whenever you open a new package of test strips, as different lots may have slight variances. Additionally, calibrate the device periodically, such as once a month, even if you continue using the same batch of strips.

<pAnother frequently asked question is, “What should I do if my readings seem inaccurate?” If you suspect inaccurate readings post-calibration, it may be worth repeating the calibration process with fresh strips and solutions. If you notice a continuing trend of discrepancies, consider reaching out to the Keto Mojo customer service team for tailored troubleshooting advice and potential device inspection.

<pLastly, many users wonder, “What does it mean if my device shows ‘Low Battery’ during calibration?” If a low battery message appears, it's crucial to replace the batteries and recalibrate the device to ensure you receive accurate results. Working with a device that has insufficient power can lead to erratic readings and, thus, misinform your dietary strategies. Maintaining a healthy supply of batteries always ensures you can promptly recalibrate and test without interruptions.",https://bigquickly.com/newarticle/img/img1/thumbnail-2025-04-15T141304.072.jpeg,N,0.0,2025-06-26 13:57:22.792431

Mitchell, Nicole Trotta",,,,,https://www.mondaq.com/unitedstates/government-contracts-procurement-ppp/1642820/ofccp-extends-enforcement-moratorium-for-vahbp-providers-until-2027,"The extended moratorium continues to suspend the enforcement of VAHBP providers' requirement to take affirmative steps to ensure equal opportunity without regard to disability or protected veteran status, obligations typically required of federal contractors and subcontractors.
Additionally, VAHBP providers will not be subject to neutral scheduling for compliance evaluations during this period – though all evaluations are currently being held in abeyance.
The moratorium was later expanded to include VAHBP providers.
The current moratorium extension provides additional time for the OFCCP to develop sub-regulatory guidance specifically addressing VAHBP providers.
While the extension offers some regulatory relief, VAHBP providers must remain aware that the moratorium does not exempt them from nondiscrimination obligations.","In a move the Agency reported is designed to maintain healthcare access for active and retired service members and their families, the Office of Federal Contract Compliance Programs (OFCCP) has announced a two-year extension to the enforcement moratorium for Veterans Affairs Health Benefits Program (VAHBP) providers. This extension, effective June 11, 2025, will now run through May 7, 2027.

The extended moratorium continues to suspend the enforcement of VAHBP providers' requirement to take affirmative steps to ensure equal opportunity without regard to disability or protected veteran status, obligations typically required of federal contractors and subcontractors. Additionally, VAHBP providers will not be subject to neutral scheduling for compliance evaluations during this period – though all evaluations are currently being held in abeyance.

Presently, the OFCCP retains authority to investigate discrimination complaints filed under Section 503 of the Rehabilitation Act (Section 503) and the Vietnam Era Veterans' Readjustment Assistance Act (VEVRAA). However, given the current administration's focus on deregulation and the recent proposed budget that would effectively eliminate the OFCCP, this moratorium extension likely reflects the need to address the previous May 2025 expiration date, rather than an indication that the agency is ramping up its activities.

This extension represents the latest in a series of actions dating back to 2014, when the OFCCP first limited its enforcement activities for TRICARE subcontractors in an effort to balance regulatory requirements and veterans' access to healthcare, allowing for more time to consider stakeholder feedback. The moratorium was later expanded to include VAHBP providers. Effective August 31 2020, OFCCP's final rule established that it does not have authority over TRICARE providers. The current moratorium extension provides additional time for the OFCCP to develop sub-regulatory guidance specifically addressing VAHBP providers.

While the extension offers some regulatory relief, VAHBP providers must remain aware that the moratorium does not exempt them from nondiscrimination obligations.

You’ll have no out-of-pocket costs for TRICARE covered preventive services if you see a TRICARE network provider, as described in the TRICARE Costs and Fees Sheet.
Learn more about getting preventive care with your TRICARE plan.
Your TRICARE health plan may cover routine eye exams.
Check out these pages for more information about eye exams and vision coverage: Eye Exams for Active Duty Service Members Eye Exams for Active Duty Family Members Eye Exams for National Guard and Reserve Members and Their Families Eye Exams for Retirees, Their Families, and All Others Do you need additional vision coverage, like coverage for glasses or contacts?","JUNE 26, 2025 – What’s on your to-do list this summer? Maybe you’re planning to spend time at the pool, go to a barbecue, or take a vacation. But don’t take a vacation from your health this summer.

“Now can be a great time for you and your family to catch up on preventive health care and take care of other health needs,” said Jeannine Pickrell, M.S., RN, director for Population Health and Disease Management, TRICARE Health Plan, at the Defense Health Agency.

Here are four suggested ways you can use your TRICARE benefits this summer.

1 – Get preventive care

Getting regular preventive care plays a key role in maintaining good health. That’s because preventive services catch problems before you show symptoms. Examples of preventive services include cancer screenings, immunizations, and Health Promotion and Disease Prevention exams.

Which preventive services do you need? Talk to your primary care manager or provider or check out TRICARE’s list of covered preventive services to learn more. Your age, sex, family history, and other risk factors play a role in which services are recommended for you.

You’ll have no out-of-pocket costs for TRICARE covered preventive services if you see a TRICARE network provider, as described in the TRICARE Costs and Fees Sheet. (Active duty service members need pre-authorization to see civilian providers.) TRICARE Prime and TRICARE Select cover one HP&DP exam annually. Learn more about getting preventive care with your TRICARE plan.

2 – Get ready for back to school

Summer is a great time to take care of health checkups for your kids. Your child’s school likely requires students to get an annual health exam and be up to date on vaccines.

TRICARE covers physicals required for school enrollment. Check with your child’s school for their health policy. Depending on these requirements, you may need to schedule more than one office visit for your child, so don’t wait until the last minute to make an appointment.

TRICARE doesn’t cover annual sports physicals, which are separate from school physicals.

Even if your child’s school doesn’t require a physical, kids can still get preventive checkups. Annual HP&DP exams are available to TRICARE enrollees ages 6 and older. TRICARE also covers well-child exams from birth through age 5.

3 – Take care of your eyes

Routine eye exams are designed to monitor your eyesight and catch any eye diseases early.

Your TRICARE health plan may cover routine eye exams. Your vision coverage depends on who you are, your plan, and your age.

Check out these pages for more information about eye exams and vision coverage:

Eye Exams for Active Duty Service Members

Eye Exams for Active Duty Family Members

Eye Exams for National Guard and Reserve Members and Their Families

Eye Exams for Retirees, Their Families, and All Others

Do you need additional vision coverage, like coverage for glasses or contacts? You may be eligible for vision coverage through the Federal Employees Dental and Vision Insurance Program. If you aren’t enrolled in a FEDVIP vision plan, you can enroll following a FEDVIP qualifying life event or during Federal Benefits Open Season each fall. (Keep in mind that FEDVIP QLEs are different from TRICARE QLEs.) Go to BENEFEDS.gov to learn more about FEDVIP eligibility and coverage.

4 – Focus on your mental health

Your mental health is an important part of your overall health and well-being. You don’t need to be in crisis to seek help. Early intervention is key to addressing mental health concerns. Early signs of possible problems may include:

Eating or sleeping too much or too little

Pulling away from people and usual activities

Having low or no energy

Having trouble concentrating

Feeling numb or like nothing matters

Experiencing unexplained aches and pains

Feeling hopeless or helpless

Smoking or drinking more than usual

TRICARE covers a range of mental health services. Services are available whether you’re seeking support for the short or long term. You can start by:

Talking to your PCM—depending on your health plan and the type of care you get, you may need a referral or pre-authorization for mental health care.

Reaching out directly to a TRICARE-authorized provider

Exploring virtual health options to speak with a provider from home

These are just a few ways to use your TRICARE benefits this summer. Want to learn more about what TRICARE covers? Go to Covered Services to search for covered services by keyword or category.

Second, are you close enough to a Military pharmacy to get your meds there? If so, call that pharmacy to see if they carry your prescription.

Lastly, if that's not an option, call 1-877-882-3324 and ask for a patient care advocate. They can help you find a solution.

That’s so strange. I too have epilepsy. It’s strange that they’re forcing you to use mail order. What’s their reason for it? You or your sponsor should call them and find out what the deal is. I’ve never heard of that. Sometimes they’ll put it in your benefits explanation letter thingie after you get your prescription that you should change to mail-order, and they make it look like it’s necessary, but when you read it, it’s just a suggestion. They do that with my kid’s contraception too. But I’d call ES to find out what the deal is and why.

In the meantime, your pharmacist wouldn’t do you a solid and give you as many discounts as possible? GoodRX or anything? That’s odd as well. If you’re on generic, check Mark Cuban’s online pharmacy. They do mail-order but for really good prices. I’m on brand name, so I can’t use it, but I keep it in mind for the future.

Good luck!

My daughter has asthma and is required to get her steroid inhaler through express scripts because it is a maintenance drug. They have been nothing but a pain. They took forever the first time sending it to where she almost ran out and now they say they are out of stock and our doctor would need to write a whole new prescription to somewhere else but only for 2 months 🙄

Express scripts allows us to transfer a script (even for 3 month fills) to a local pharmacy. Is that not an option? If you log in there should options to 'find a pharmacy' and 'check coverage' from the prescription tab and those will allow you to select where you can get the script from as well. Not sure if this is the same for Tricare young adults.

Other than that the military pharmacy is another option like Hazardous mentioned. But I would call them and see what your options are.",,N,0.0,2025-06-25 21:56:30.482287

The Justice Department has arrested a Defense Department employee for removing classified documents from a Missile Defense Agency office in Huntsville, Alabama. Ewa Ciszak made her initial appearance in federal court Monday. Beginning in February, the FBI said Ciszack began taking classified documents from MDA facilities without authorization. A June 18 search warrant turned up multiple secret-level documents at her personal residence and in her vehicle and backpack. Ciszak had been employed at MDA since January 2023.

The Department of Homeland Security is bringing back a key advisory panel with new members. Governor Henry McMaster (R-S.C.) has been named the new chairman of the Homeland Security Advisory Council. Silicon Valley Investor Marc Andreeson, former New York City Mayor Rudy Giuliani and former Trump campaign manager Corey Lewandowski have also been tapped by Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem to serve on the committee. The Trump administration dismissed all members of DHS advisory panels earlier this year. The reconstituted Homeland Security Advisory Council’s first meeting will be held July 2.

About half of Americans are opposed to the Trump administration’s recent changes to the federal government. That’s according to new research from the Partnership for Public Service. The Partnership’s findings show that 55 percent of the public believes the White House’s cuts to agencies will hurt the U.S. economy. But supporters of the Trump administration’s actions said the changes will pay off in the long run. The results of the Partnership’s latest survey are similar to other findings from the organization over the last few months.

A report finds air traffic controllers are unevenly distributed leading to overstaffing in some facilities, and understaffing in others. A report by the National Academies of Sciences finds 30% of FAA’s more than 300 air traffic control facilities are overstaffed. About 1,700 employees work in facilities staffed at more than 115% of their workforce targets. Another 30% of facilities are understaffed. The report recommends the Federal Aviation Administration do more to incentivize air traffic controllers to relocate to understaffed facilities. FAA’s air traffic controller workforce declined by almost 2,000 employees since 2010.

A federal judge is temporarily blocking the implementation of an executive order that excluded employees at numerous federal agencies from collective bargaining rights. The preliminary injunction is part of a union lawsuit challenging President Trump’s March order that applied a broad national security exemption to union representation at 20 agencies. Judge James Donato found the plaintiffs raised serious First Amendment issues, and that implementation of the order needs to be put on hold until the case goes to trial.

A new rule from the Trump administration gives agencies more leeway to fire probationary employees. Agencies can now decide whether or not to keep a probationary employee based broadly on “agency needs and the interest of the public.” Previously, probationary workers could only be fired for issues with performance or conduct. President Trump had previously ordered the creation of a “Civil Service Rule XI” to make the alterations to probationary periods. The administration’s changes come as agencies face multiple legal battles after firing probationary employees based on performance, despite the employees not having any performance issues on record.

Congressman Robert Garcia (D-Calif.) is now the top Democrat on the House Oversight and Reform Committee. Democratic members elected the California lawmaker yesterday, beating out Congressman Stephen Lynch (D-Mass.). Garcia replaces former Congressman Gerry Connolly (D-Va.), who passed away last month. Garcia has served on the committee for two years and has been in Congress since 2020. As the new ranking member of the House Oversight committee, Garcia promised to focus on rooting out government corruption and increasing government efficiency. Garcia has served on the committee for two years and has been in Congress since 2020.

The Navy’s top IT and personnel leaders are at odds about the future of the service’s human resources modernization effort. At the center of the clash is a $170 million contract awarded in 2024 to Pantheon Data. Personnel leadership saw the contract as one of the most pivotal efforts to modernize Navy HR systems. But Department of the Navy Chief Information Officer Jane Rathbun, along with the Department of Government Efficiency, killed it — ignoring warnings that the move would stall progress and hurt the Navy’s ability to recruit and retain talent. Personnel leaders told House lawmakers that the Navy CIO recommended switching back to the system that is “seven years behind the schedule.” The chief information officer also argued that government employees could handle the work contractors were performing. But personnel leaders said it would be “financially irresponsible” to begin developing that skill set within the Navy.

Agencies now have a fifth vendor to buy software from under an enterprisewide deal. The General Services Administration finalized a governmentwide contract with Elastic for its cybersecurity observability and analytics platform. Under the deal, agencies could see anywhere from 15% to a 60% discount off the GSA Schedule price. The discounts are valid through September 2027. Unlike previous enterprise software deals with Google, Adobe and others that end in 2025, Elastic's discounts are valid through September 2027. This latest deal is part of GSA's OneGov strategy to reduce duplication and achieve cost savings.

Veterans Affairs is processing disability benefits claims faster than ever before. Its gone through more than two million claims so far this fiscal year and is on track to process 14% more claims than it did last year. The department has already paid more than $120 billion dollars in compensation and pension benefits to veterans and their survivors so far this fiscal year. The VA is focused on reducing a backlog of these claims and has brought back mandatory overtime to help achieve its goal.

Severe medical staffing shortages at Naval Hospital Bremerton have left thousands of service members and their families without access to on-base health care at one of the country’s largest naval installations. Senator Patty Murray pressed Navy Secretary John Phelan about repeated staffing cuts ordered by the Defense Health Agency at Naval Base Kitsap. The hospital’s internal medicine department currently has no physicians for more than 2,000 patients. Phelan, who has been touring military installations since taking office, acknowledged systemic problems across Navy installations, including poor conditions in barracks and medical facilities. The staffing crisis at Naval Hospital Bremerton, however, reflects broader challenges across the military health system.

Stephen Ferrara, acting assistant secretary of defense for health affairs, visited Bayne‑Jones Army Community Hospital on June 24 to gain firsthand insight into the installation’s medical readiness mission and the hospital’s vital role in supporting Soldiers rotating through the Joint Readiness Training Center at Fort Polk.
Gen. Jason A. Curl, commanding general of the JRTC and Fort Polk, stressed the challenges rotational units face while conducting high‑risk activities in the austere conditions of the combat training center.
“BJACH is more than a hospital-its’ the heartbeat of our community and the backbone of readiness at Fort Polk,” said Col. Patrick W. Miller, commander of Bayne-Jones Army Community Hospital.
“It was about listening, verifying, and ensuring that our policies align with the operational realities on the ground at places like Fort Polk.”","FORT POLK, La. —Dr. Stephen Ferrara, acting assistant secretary of defense for health affairs, visited Bayne‑Jones Army Community Hospital on June 24 to gain firsthand insight into the installation’s medical readiness mission and the hospital’s vital role in supporting Soldiers rotating through the Joint Readiness Training Center at Fort Polk.

Ferrara, a retired Navy physician and principal medical advisor to the secretary of defense, said that seeing operations on site is critical to grasp the complexity of military healthcare in rural environments.

“The information I receive at the Pentagon is often a filtered snapshot,” Ferrara said. “Being on the ground provides the context and depth I need to truly understand the challenges our healthcare professionals face—and to identify ways we can better support them through technology, staffing and policy decisions.”

Ferrara emphasized BJACH’s importance to the JRTC mission, where medically ready Soldiers are essential to fully staffed training rotations.

“We must train as we fight,” Ferrara said. “That includes making sure our medics, doctors and nurses are trained and equipped to meet the realities of the battlefield. Our ultimate weapon system is the warfighter, and we must optimize human performance to keep that system strong.”

Ferrara said BJACH’s role in diagnosing, treating and returning Soldiers to duty is essential to operational readiness—helping units maintain deployable strength and ensuring commanders have the medically ready force they need to train and fight.

Brig. Gen. Jason A. Curl, commanding general of the JRTC and Fort Polk, stressed the challenges rotational units face while conducting high‑risk activities in the austere conditions of the combat training center.

“Having BJACH available mitigates some of the challenges brigade‑level commanders face when Soldiers are taken from the fight due to injuries or illnesses,” Curl said. “Whether it’s extreme heat, heavy rain, or the wildlife, we rely on BJACH’s ability to operate 24/7 as a full‑service hospital. That kind of round‑the‑clock capacity is critical to ensuring Soldiers can be treated and returned to their units quickly. Without it, we’d lose readiness and risk the cohesion and capabilities of our rotational units.”

Curl emphasized that BJACH’s full‑spectrum family health services are also strategic in recruiting and retaining top talent.

“Quality family health services are essential for attracting the best and brightest to serve as observer–coach–trainers at the JRTC,” he said. “They expect comprehensive care for themselves and their families when they come here.”

During his visit, Ferrara met with hospital and installation leadership, toured the emergency department, surgical services, labor, delivery, recovery and postpartum unit, and the mixed medical‑surgical ward. He received briefings on staffing, infrastructure and readiness trends, recognized several BJACH team members, and took questions from staff during an open forum.

“BJACH is more than a hospital-its’ the heartbeat of our community and the backbone of readiness at Fort Polk,” said Col. Patrick W. Miller, commander of Bayne-Jones Army Community Hospital. “Having our capabilities on site not only ensures Soldiers are cared for and returned to duty, but it also shows commitment to their Families and the broader post community. This visit allows us to showcase our scope and ask for the support needed to sustain care for our warfighters-and those they come home to.”

Ferrara also highlighted efforts to improve collaboration across the Military Health System by aligning staffing roles among the services and standardizing clinical qualifications.

“A physical therapist at BJACH, for example, should have the same responsibilities and qualifications as one at Walter Reed or the Naval Medical Center San Diego,” he said. “That kind of consistency improves quality, simplifies staffing, and supports interoperability.”

As part of that effort, Ferrara said his office is focused on seamless data sharing through MHS GENESIS and future AI‑enabled tools to support efficiency, accuracy and reduced provider workload.

Ferrara acknowledged the staffing challenges faced by rural medical treatment facilities and laid out initiatives including recruitment and retention incentives, infrastructure investments, expanded virtual health options and regional partnerships with civilian healthcare systems.

“We’re expanding telehealth, cutting red tape, and looking for smart ways to deliver high‑quality care close to home—especially at facilities like BJACH,” he said. “That means thinking creatively about workforce solutions and partnering where it makes sense, while never compromising the care our beneficiaries deserve.”

“This visit wasn’t just a walk‑through,” Ferrara said. “It was about listening, verifying, and ensuring that our policies align with the operational realities on the ground at places like Fort Polk.”",https://api.army.mil/e2/c/images/2025/06/25/9e957ad9/max1200.jpg,N,0.0,2025-06-25 18:56:24.244600

Stephen Ferrara, acting assistant secretary of defense for health affairs, visited Bayne‑Jones Army Community Hospital on June 24 to gain firsthand insight into the installation’s medical readiness mission and the hospital’s vital role in supporting Soldiers rotating through the Joint Readiness Training Center at Fort Polk.
Gen. Jason A. Curl, commanding general of the JRTC and Fort Polk, stressed the challenges rotational units face while conducting high‑risk activities in the austere conditions of the combat training center.
“BJACH is more than a hospital-its’ the heartbeat of our community and the backbone of readiness at Fort Polk,” said Col. Patrick W. Miller, commander of Bayne-Jones Army Community Hospital.
“It was about listening, verifying, and ensuring that our policies align with the operational realities on the ground at places like Fort Polk.”","FORT POLK, La. —Dr. Stephen Ferrara, acting assistant secretary of defense for health affairs, visited Bayne‑Jones Army Community Hospital on June 24 to gain firsthand insight into the installation’s medical readiness mission and the hospital’s vital role in supporting Soldiers rotating through the Joint Readiness Training Center at Fort Polk.

Ferrara, a retired Navy physician and principal medical advisor to the secretary of defense, said that seeing operations on site is critical to grasp the complexity of military healthcare in rural environments.

“The information I receive at the Pentagon is often a filtered snapshot,” Ferrara said. “Being on the ground provides the context and depth I need to truly understand the challenges our healthcare professionals face—and to identify ways we can better support them through technology, staffing and policy decisions.”

Ferrara emphasized BJACH’s importance to the JRTC mission, where medically ready Soldiers are essential to fully staffed training rotations.

“We must train as we fight,” Ferrara said. “That includes making sure our medics, doctors and nurses are trained and equipped to meet the realities of the battlefield. Our ultimate weapon system is the warfighter, and we must optimize human performance to keep that system strong.”

Ferrara said BJACH’s role in diagnosing, treating and returning Soldiers to duty is essential to operational readiness—helping units maintain deployable strength and ensuring commanders have the medically ready force they need to train and fight.

Brig. Gen. Jason A. Curl, commanding general of the JRTC and Fort Polk, stressed the challenges rotational units face while conducting high‑risk activities in the austere conditions of the combat training center.

“Having BJACH available mitigates some of the challenges brigade‑level commanders face when Soldiers are taken from the fight due to injuries or illnesses,” Curl said. “Whether it’s extreme heat, heavy rain, or the wildlife, we rely on BJACH’s ability to operate 24/7 as a full‑service hospital. That kind of round‑the‑clock capacity is critical to ensuring Soldiers can be treated and returned to their units quickly. Without it, we’d lose readiness and risk the cohesion and capabilities of our rotational units.”

Curl emphasized that BJACH’s full‑spectrum family health services are also strategic in recruiting and retaining top talent.

Additionally, VAHBP providers will not be subject to neutral scheduling for compliance evaluations during this period – though all evaluations are currently being held in abeyance.
The moratorium was later expanded to include VAHBP providers.
The current moratorium extension provides additional time for the OFCCP to develop sub-regulatory guidance specifically addressing VAHBP providers.
While the extension offers some regulatory relief, VAHBP providers must remain aware that the moratorium does not exempt them from nondiscrimination obligations.","In a move the Agency reported is designed to maintain healthcare access for active and retired service members and their families, the Office of Federal Contract Compliance Programs (OFCCP) has announced a two-year extension to the enforcement moratorium for Veterans Affairs Health Benefits Program (VAHBP) providers. This extension, effective June 11, 2025, will now run through May 7, 2027.

The extended moratorium continues to suspend the enforcement of VAHBP providers’ requirement to take affirmative steps to ensure equal opportunity without regard to disability or protected veteran status, obligations typically required of federal contractors and subcontractors. Additionally, VAHBP providers will not be subject to neutral scheduling for compliance evaluations during this period – though all evaluations are currently being held in abeyance.

Presently, the OFCCP retains authority to investigate discrimination complaints filed under Section 503 of the Rehabilitation Act (Section 503) and the Vietnam Era Veterans’ Readjustment Assistance Act (VEVRAA). However, given the current administration’s focus on deregulation and the recent proposed budget that would effectively eliminate the OFCCP, this moratorium extension likely reflects the need to address the previous May 2025 expiration date, rather than an indication that the agency is ramping up its activities.

This extension represents the latest in a series of actions dating back to 2014, when the OFCCP first limited its enforcement activities for TRICARE subcontractors in an effort to balance regulatory requirements and veterans’ access to healthcare, allowing for more time to consider stakeholder feedback. The moratorium was later expanded to include VAHBP providers. Effective August 31 2020, OFCCP’s final rule established that it does not have authority over TRICARE providers. The current moratorium extension provides additional time for the OFCCP to develop sub-regulatory guidance specifically addressing VAHBP providers.

“Since 2022, the Defense Health Agency has repeatedly ordered the base’s hospital to cut critical staff and medical care — which has been devastating for our service members and their families’ access to health care.
And we’re working, like all the other services, to make sure we’re providing the best health care we can for our servicemembers and our families,” Kilby said.
Naval Hospital Bremerton said they were losing all active-duty internal medicine physicians mainly due to retirement and permanent change-of-station orders, but these routine military processes cannot explain the hospital’s chronic shortages, according to Murray.
She said DHA’s failure to address the issue within established staffing systems “ raises serious concerns about whether DHA can address it in a timely manner.” The crisis at Naval Hospital Bremerton, however, reflects broader challenges across the military health system.","Severe medical staffing shortages at Naval Hospital Bremerton have left thousands of service members and their families without access to on-base health care at one of the country’s largest naval installations.

During the Senate Appropriations Committee budget hearing on Tuesday, Sen. Patty Murray (D-Wash.) pressed Navy senior officials about repeated staffing cuts ordered by the Defense Health Agency (DHA) at Naval Base Kitsap — home to more than 15,000 active-duty service members and 18,000 family members and retirees.

The hospital’s internal medicine department currently has no physicians for more than 2,000 patients. With no immediate plans to fill the vacancies, the Defense Health Agency has been directing patients to the nearby Madigan Army Medical Center at Joint Base Lewis-McChord.

“Since 2022, the Defense Health Agency has repeatedly ordered the base’s hospital to cut critical staff and medical care — which has been devastating for our service members and their families’ access to health care. Instead of hiring anyone, DHA is forcing patients to travel over an hour, on a good day, each way. This is just unacceptable,” Murray said.

Navy Secretary John Phelan, who has been touring military installations since taking office, acknowledged widespread problems across the force, including inadequate medical infrastructure.

“As you know, I’ve been visiting a number of different installations of ours, and from some of the conditions of the barracks to some of the conditions in the medical facilities, we have issues at most of them. On that specific one I’m going to have to get back to you and get some more detail on it. Which I will do,” Phelan said.

Murray has repeatedly raised concerns about ongoing staffing shortfalls and reduced services at Naval Hospital Bremerton, which have forced hundreds of patients to seek care at off base medical facilities.

By February 2025, the hospital’s troubled internal medicine department was operating with just one physician for 2,200 patients. That physician has since left — about 700 retirees and veterans have since been transferred to civilian medical facilities across Kitsap County as a result.

“The reassignment of patients to new providers presents significant challenges, including disruptions in continuity of care which has led to gaps in treatment and potential declines in patient outcomes. It is also causing logistical and transportation barriers, particularly for older veterans or those with mobility limitations and difficulties in specialized care coordination, especially in designated Health Professional Shortage Areas (HPSAs). These concerns must be addressed immediately,” Murray wrote in a letter to then-acting DHA Director David Smith in March.

Acting Chief of Naval Operations Adm. James Kilby echoed Murray’s concerns, acknowledging that there are “challenges with DHA across the board.”

“I agree with your assessment. And we’re working, like all the other services, to make sure we’re providing the best health care we can for our servicemembers and our families,” Kilby said.

Naval Hospital Bremerton said they were losing all active-duty internal medicine physicians mainly due to retirement and permanent change-of-station orders, but these routine military processes cannot explain the hospital’s chronic shortages, according to Murray. She said DHA’s failure to address the issue within established staffing systems “ raises serious concerns about whether DHA can address it in a timely manner.”

The crisis at Naval Hospital Bremerton, however, reflects broader challenges across the military health system. Since DHA assumed management of all military treatment facilities, bases nationwide have reported shortages of physicians and nurses, longer wait times for care and increasing reliance on civilian providers.

The situation at Bremerton has worsened over the past several years. In 2021, the hospital’s emergency department was downgraded to an urgent care clinic. In 2023, the Department of Health and Human Services designated Kitsap County as a “high-risk” and “health shortage area.” By 2024, the hospital was struggling to provide access to primary care, mental health services and maternal health.

“This is a readiness issue. It’s a retention issue. It’s personal for these families. So please, if you could get back to me about what steps we are going to take to fix this,” Murray said.

The Texas native's office exclusively shared a letter with News 4 that he sent to Texas veteran service organizations on June 18.

""I was appreciative of the letter. I think it was very general,"" said Mission Alpha Advocacy CEO Kristi Cabiao. ""What we would like to have from Congress is some accountability. For Congress to go to the Defense Health Agency (DHA) and say, 'Did you validate these processes before you awarded the contract?'""

Senator Cornyn says the TriWest region and systems have caused 'avoidable disruptions in the adjustment,' adding that several beneficiaries had their claims automatically rejected.

The letter also highlights beneficiaries' struggles with disenrollment and care approvals and providers' fight against delayed payments.

""My office has been in contact with DHA and TriWest to urge better communication, and we have confirmed that affected beneficiaries can still reinstate their coverage, but only by phone and only until June 30, 2025,"" Cornyn said.

""I am very grateful that Senator Cornyn is still staying the course on this issue,"" Cabiao said. ""He's still following Tricare and the experiences of the military families and providers, because the bottom line is, this is a military readiness issue.""

Cabiao is also a retired veteran's spouse. She said the group met with TriWest representatives Monday, adding that things are slowly improving — but not quickly enough.

""The reality is, it's June 24 and we're still experiencing a lot of the same barriers that families and providers experienced back in January and February,"" she said.

Senator Cornyn promised to stay engaged with the DHA and TriWest to make sure those issues don't go unchecked.

""We will continue to monitor this issue closely to ensure provider confidence and continuity of care... and to ensure access to timely, reliable, and quality care as this transition continues,"" he said.

""I think the issue is that the Defense Health Agency, which is part of the [Department of Defense], has the ultimate responsibility of oversight for our healthcare delivery,"" Cabiao said.

Cornyn also emphasized the importance of healthcare for service members and those around them.

""Our Servicemembers, veterans, and their families deserve dependable healthcare access. My office will stay engaged with DHA and TriWest to ensure these issues are addressed,"" Cornyn said.

""It's a trickle-down effect when the top level doesn't do the appropriate oversight and provide the accountability to validate that the needs can be met,"" Cabiao added. ""Ultimately, the military families pay the price.""

We also reached out to representatives with the TriWest Healthcare Alliance for their thoughts about the letter.

Their spokesperson said, ""We are proud to work with Senator Cornyn and the Texas congressional delegation to help ensure military families receive the care they have earned,"" adding that they plan to continue working to give Texas providers and military families the best service.

They also said the Tricare re-enrollment deadline for people who were rejected has been extended to July 31st.

FULL TRIWEST STATEMENT:

“We are proud to work with Senator Cornyn and the Texas congressional delegation to help ensure military families receive the care they have earned. We have made significant progress since the transition began in January and are proud to report that we have over 227,600 provider locations in Texas; we are processing claims within an average of 8 days, headed toward our goal of under 5; and our average speed to answer a customer service call is under 2 minutes. We will continue working hard to achieve the very best service for providers and military families across Texas. We want to thank Senator Cornyn for helping communicate these important issues to families and providers.”

FULL LETTER FROM SENATOR JOHN CORNYN:

Dear Tricare Beneficiaries and Providers, As your Senator, I want to update you on recent changes to the Department of Defense’s Tricare system that may negatively impact many Texans’ access to care and the steps my office is taking in response.

On January 1, 2025, the Defense Health Agency (DHA) completed a realignment of Tricare coverage areas which moved several states, including Texas, from the Tricare East Region to the Tricare West Region. Additionally, DHA awarded a new contract to manage the Tricare West Region, replacing HealthNet Federal Services with TriWest Healthcare Alliance (TriWest). Humana Military continues to oversee the Tricare East Region.

These two changes were intended to streamline care and improve service, but unfortunately, many Texans have endured avoidable disruptions in the adjustment. Here’s what you need to know and what actions you can take to avoid further disruptions:

1. Many Beneficiaries Were Disenrolled Because Their Credit/Debit Card or Electronic Funds Transfer Payment Information Could Not Be Conveyed from Humana to TriWest.

Due to existing regulations, Humana could not transfer certain types of payment information, such as a beneficiary’s credit/debit card information or electronic funds transfer details, to TriWest once they assumed responsibility for Tricare coverage in Texas on January 1, 2025. Those beneficiaries paying via allotment from a pension or retirement account were not affected. While TriWest and DHA attempted to notify beneficiaries of the need to register payment information with TriWest, several thousand were unable to do so and consequently disenrolled after 90 days of non-payment of applicable fees and charges. My office has been in contact with DHA and TriWest to urge better communication, and we have confirmed that affected beneficiaries can still reinstate their coverage, but only by phone and only until June 30, 2025. After that, the next opportunity for re-enrollment will be the fall Open Season enrollment period, which will begin in November 2025 for 2026 Tricare coverage.

2. Many Beneficiaries Experienced Difficulties in Receiving TriWest Approvals for Specialty Care.

Some Tricare beneficiaries encountered delays receiving care due to issues with civilian provider referrals. These delays were caused by TriWest’s requirement to manually review all referrals, combined with understaffing and slow scheduling with network specialists. DHA responded with a temporary waiver allowing beneficiaries in Texas to seek care without a referral, but that waiver is set to expire on June 30th. My office continues to exercise oversight with regards to delayed referrals and will continue to work with TriWest and DHA to minimize delays with these referrals.

3. Many Healthcare Providers Have Experienced Delays in Receiving Reimbursement for Services Rendered.

My office has heard from many healthcare providers across Texas who experienced significant delays in receiving reimbursements for services rendered once TriWest received the new contract. Our office raised this issue directly with TriWest, DHA, and the incoming Under Secretary of Defense for Personnel and Readiness who has oversight responsibilities for DHA. TriWest indicated that many claims were automatically rejected in error during processing due to minor differences in claim information, such as the provider’s name or address, on the submitted claim did not correspond to the registry data TriWest received from Humana. TriWest has indicated that these data discrepancies have largely been resolved and that since January 1st of this year, roughly 94% of claims have been paid within 30 days. We will continue to monitor this issue closely to ensure provider confidence and continuity of care.

4. What Steps Should or Can You Take, and How We Can Help to Avoid Disruptions With These Ongoing Changes.

If you have been disenrolled, need to verify your coverage, or if you are facing delays in specialty care, call TriWest at 1-888-874-9378 to check your status or see if you qualify for direct access under the waiver.

If you’re unable to get help through TriWest, or if you are a provider and are still not receiving payment, please contact my office online at

Our Servicemembers, veterans, and their families deserve dependable healthcare access. My office will stay engaged with DHA and TriWest to ensure these issues are addressed and to ensure access to timely, reliable, and quality care as this transition continues.",https://news4sanantonio.com/resources/media2/16x9/180/986/1x7/90/b3bcc2f4-9ff5-4368-941e-6c3086696faa-JOHNCORNYNHEADSHOT.jpg,N,-1.0,2025-06-25 06:56:19.887543

The counties affected are Albany, Bronx, Broome, Chenango, Clinton, Columbia, Cortland, Delaware, Dutchess, Essex, Greene, Kings, Madison, Nassau, New York, Oneida, Onondaga, Orange, Otsego, Putnam, Queens, Rensselaer, Richmond, Rockland, Saratoga, Schenectady, Suffolk, Tioga, Ulster, Warren, Washington, and Westchester.

To receive an emergency refill of prescription medications, TRICARE beneficiaries should take their prescription bottle to any TRICARE retail network pharmacy. If the bottle is unavailable or the label is damaged or missing, beneficiaries should contact Express Scripts, Inc., or their retail network pharmacy for assistance.

To find a network pharmacy, beneficiaries may call Express Scripts at 1-877-363-1303, or search the network pharmacy locator (https://militaryrx.express-scripts.com/find-pharmacy).

If possible, visit the pharmacy where the prescription was filled. Prescriptions filled by a retail chain may be filled at another store in that chain. If the clinician who prescribed the medication is available, beneficiaries can ask them to call in a new prescription to any network pharmacy.

As a reminder, TRICARE beneficiaries, other than active duty service members, may receive urgent care from any TRICARE-authorized urgent care center or provider and do not need a referral. This allows beneficiaries to seek nonemergency care for illnesses or injuries if their primary care provider is unavailable because of emergencies. Any TRICARE beneficiary who reasonably believes they have an emergency should always call 911 or, go to the nearest emergency room.

Beneficiaries are advised to visit Express Scripts’ Weather Notices page for updates (https://militaryrx.express-scripts.com/notices/weather).

According to Practice Greenhealth (PGH), the award recognizes USNHO's ongoing commitment to improving its environmental performance and efforts to build sustainability and resilience into its operations and culture. PGH is the organization with which the Defense Health Agency (DHA) has partnered to track suitability metrics, allowing military hospitals and clinics to compare their sustainability performance against that of their civilian counterparts. From the DHA's website: Sustainability and Environmental Programs operate with the understanding that ""there is a direct link between healing the individual and healing this planet… we will not have healthy individuals, healthy families, and healthy communities if we do not have clean air, clean water, and healthy soil.""

The DHA Sustainability Policy, DHA-AI 4710.01, establishes sustainability goals and environmental compliance targets for military hospitals and clinics and requires the formation of cross-functional sustainability teams to promote a resource-aware stewardship culture. DHA has been implementing this program through a rolling start date initiative that USNHO decided to implement early with the mentality of ""why wait.""

Ron Stallings, Safety and Occupational Health Manager, Respiratory Protection Program Manager, Environment of Care Co-Chair, Operational Risk Management Assistant, and Sustainability Champion, was the right person to help bring a committee together to start working towards accomplishing and establishing the DHA's sustainability goals and environmental targets. Mr. Stallings recognized the size and scope of the job. He tasked his committee to not only identify areas that could be improved and projects that needed to be accomplished but also recognize things already being applied or strategies from higher DOD initiatives that were already being implemented in the hospital. Features like water bottle fill stations throughout the hospital save thousands of plastic disposable bottles each year. Stallings also said, ""Once you start thinking about sustainability, you can come up with ideas for incentivizing the staff to participate, too."" He mentioned an idea that would challenge employees to ride a bike to work, promoting a healthy body while simultaneously supporting green initiatives that reduce pollution created by driving cars.

The pharmacy-led initiative involved reducing pharmaceutical waste by leveraging new technology, Q-Anywhere, to prepare medications only when requested by the patient. At USNHO, most outpatient pharmaceutical waste is generated from drugs that are filled but never picked up by the patient. Q-Anywhere is designed to enable patients to communicate electronically with the pharmacy when they have a new prescription that needs to be filled. Since the implementation of Q-Anywhere on 14 March, we have seen a 55% decrease in medications returned to stock. This equals a drug cost savings of approximately $ 1,804. Labor savings of ~ 41.5 hours and supply (vials, labels, paper bag, etc) savings of ~ $82.27. That is 249 medication bottles that did not end up in the trash, which is a huge accomplishment, especially here in Japan, where it is prohibited to recycle any bottles with drug residue. They also helped save what may be the most precious resource time by installing an automated refill prescription kiosk. One benefit of ScriptCenters is that they allow you to pick up your prescription after pharmacies or clinics are closed, providing you with 24/7 access. After-hours prescription pickup is especially helpful if you are unable to visit the pharmacy during regular operating hours. This convenience means you have less congested pharmacy lobbies, increased access to same-day prescription needs, and significantly shorter wait times.

The U.S. Navy Medicine Readiness and Training Command Okinawa (USNMRTCO) supports the Defense Health Agency's U.S. Naval Hospital, Okinawa (USNHO) as the largest OCONUS Navy Medicine medical treatment facility and stands at the ready to respond to contingency operations to support the INDOPACOM region. It is a critical regional asset for direct care delivery, regional referrals, and medical contingency operations. The staff of USNHO understands their vital role as pre-positioned, forward-deployed naval forces within the first island chain, aligned and in support of the joint military commands and operations.

You’ll have no out-of-pocket costs for TRICARE covered preventive services if you see a TRICARE network provider, as described in the TRICARE Costs and Fees Sheet.
Learn more about getting preventive care with your TRICARE plan.
Your TRICARE health plan may cover routine eye exams.
Check out these pages for more information about eye exams and vision coverage: • Eye Exams for Active Duty Service Members • Eye Exams for Active Duty Family Members • Eye Exams for National Guard and Reserve Members and Their Families • Eye Exams for Retirees, Their Families, and All Others Do you need additional vision coverage, like coverage for glasses or contacts?","What’s on your to-do list this summer? Maybe you’re planning to spend time at the pool, go to a barbecue, or take a vacation. But don’t take a vacation from your health this summer.

“Now can be a great time for you and your family to catch up on preventive health care and take care of other health needs,” said Jeannine Pickrell, M.S., RN, director for Population Health and Disease Management, TRICARE Health Plan, at the Defense Health Agency.

Here are four suggested ways you can use your TRICARE benefits this summer.

1. Get preventive care

Getting regular preventive care plays a key role in maintaining good health. That’s because preventive services catch problems before you show symptoms. Examples of preventive services include cancer screenings, immunizations, and Health Promotion and Disease Prevention exams.

Which preventive services do you need? Talk to your primary care manager or provider or check out TRICARE’s list of covered preventive services to learn more. Your age, sex, family history, and other risk factors play a role in which services are recommended for you.

You’ll have no out-of-pocket costs for TRICARE covered preventive services if you see a TRICARE network provider, as described in the TRICARE Costs and Fees Sheet. (Active duty service members need pre-authorization to see civilian providers.) TRICARE Prime and TRICARE Select cover one HP&DP exam annually. Learn more about getting preventive care with your TRICARE plan.

2. Get ready for back to school

Summer is a great time to take care of health checkups for your kids. Your child’s school likely requires students to get an annual health exam and be up to date on vaccines.

TRICARE covers physicals required for school enrollment. Check with your child’s school for their health policy. Depending on these requirements, you may need to schedule more than one office visit for your child, so don’t wait until the last minute to make an appointment.

TRICARE doesn’t cover annual sports physicals, which are separate from school physicals.

Even if your child’s school doesn’t require a physical, kids can still get preventive checkups. Annual HP&DP exams are available to TRICARE enrollees ages 6 and older. TRICARE also covers well-child exams from birth through age 5.

3. Take care of your eyes

Routine eye exams are designed to monitor your eyesight and catch any eye diseases early.

Your TRICARE health plan may cover routine eye exams. Your vision coverage depends on who you are, your plan, and your age.

Check out these pages for more information about eye exams and vision coverage:

• Eye Exams for Active Duty Service Members

• Eye Exams for Active Duty Family Members

• Eye Exams for National Guard and Reserve Members and Their Families

• Eye Exams for Retirees, Their Families, and All Others

Do you need additional vision coverage, like coverage for glasses or contacts? You may be eligible for vision coverage through the Federal Employees Dental and Vision Insurance Program. If you aren’t enrolled in a FEDVIP vision plan, you can enroll following a FEDVIP qualifying life event or during Federal Benefits Open Season each fall. (Keep in mind that FEDVIP QLEs are different from TRICARE QLEs.) Go to BENEFEDS.gov to learn more about FEDVIP eligibility and coverage.

4. Focus on your mental health

Your mental health is an important part of your overall health and well-being. You don’t need to be in crisis to seek help. Early intervention is key to addressing mental health concerns. Early signs of possible problems may include:

• Eating or sleeping too much or too little

• Pulling away from people and usual activities

• Having low or no energy

• Having trouble concentrating

• Feeling numb or like nothing matters

• Experiencing unexplained aches and pains

• Feeling hopeless or helpless

• Smoking or drinking more than usual

TRICARE covers a range of mental health services. Services are available whether you’re seeking support for the short or long term. You can start by:

• Talking to your PCM—depending on your health plan and the type of care you get, you may need a referral or pre-authorization for mental health care.

• Reaching out directly to a TRICARE-authorized provider

• Exploring virtual health options to speak with a provider from home

These are just a few ways to use your TRICARE benefits this summer. Want to learn more about what TRICARE covers? Go to Covered Services to search for covered services by keyword or category.

The company executed the workforce reduction on June 18. According to InvestingPro data, this move comes as the stock has declined over 70% in the past six months.

Zynex anticipates approximately $5 million in annualized cost savings as a result of the reduction. The total estimated costs and cash expenditures related to the workforce reduction are about $0.2 million, with most of these expenses tied to employee severance.

Affected employees were notified of the reduction on or around June 18. Zynex stated that the workforce reduction is part of a planned adjustment to its order processing and billing strategy. The company noted that this action is not related to the temporary suspension of payments by Tricare.

All information is based on a statement in the company’s recent SEC filing.

In other recent news, Zynex Inc. reported its financial results for the first quarter of 2025, which fell significantly short of market expectations.

NEWTON, MA, UNITED STATES, June 24, 2025 /EINPresswire.com/ -- Northeast Health Services is proud to now offer NeuroStar Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (TMS) therapy at its Newton, Massachusetts mental health clinic. TMS is a safe, effective, non-drug treatment for major depression without the common side effects of medication. It is FDA-cleared to treat depression, depression with anxiety, and OCD. Most major insurances cover NeuroStar TMS, including Medicare and Tricare plans nationwide. If you have been diagnosed with major depressive disorder (MDD) and have not experienced relief from antidepressants, NeuroStar TMS might be right for you!

NeuroStar TMS uses focused magnetic pulses (similar in strength to an MRI), to revitalize underactive areas of the brain involved in regulating mood. When these regions are underactive, depression can result. “Waking up” these regions can have a lasting effect on depression, making long-term remission from depression a reality for many people. A typical TMS treatment plan includes 36 sessions that each last between 19-37 minutes. Completing the full treatment course gives the best chance for delivering long-lasting relief from depression. TMS therapy is a highly effective treatment option for individuals battling treatment-resistant depression, offering renewed hope and lasting relief.

A real-world study reported an 83% response rate. This means that 83% of patients that completed their NeuroStar TMS treatment cycle saw measurable improvement in their depression symptoms. The same real-world study reported a 62% remission rate. This means that 62% of patients that completed their NeuroStar TMS treatment cycle likely wouldn’t be diagnosed with MDD if they were first being evaluated by their doctor.

Northeast Health Services is proud to offer a full suite of mental health services including therapy and psychiatric medication management and alternative treatment options like NeuroStar TMS. This collaborative, multidisciplinary approach Northeast Health Services follows in its clinics allows the team to create an individualized treatment plan that is tailored to you.

The Newton clinic is now accepting both new and existing patients for TMS therapy evaluations. For more information or to schedule an appointment, please contact Northeast Health Services at (413)-846-1848 or visit our website at https://nehs.transformationsnetwork.com/schedule-appointment/.

Additionally, VAHBP providers will not be subject to neutral scheduling for compliance evaluations during this period – though all evaluations are currently being held in abeyance.
The moratorium was later expanded to include VAHBP providers.
The current moratorium extension provides additional time for the OFCCP to develop sub-regulatory guidance specifically addressing VAHBP providers.
While the extension offers some regulatory relief, VAHBP providers must remain aware that the moratorium does not exempt them from nondiscrimination obligations.","In a move the Agency reported is designed to maintain healthcare access for active and retired service members and their families, the Office of Federal Contract Compliance Programs (OFCCP) has announced a two-year extension to the enforcement moratorium for Veterans Affairs Health Benefits Program (VAHBP) providers. This extension, effective June 11, 2025, will now run through May 7, 2027.

The extended moratorium continues to suspend the enforcement of VAHBP providers’ requirement to take affirmative steps to ensure equal opportunity without regard to disability or protected veteran status, obligations typically required of federal contractors and subcontractors. Additionally, VAHBP providers will not be subject to neutral scheduling for compliance evaluations during this period – though all evaluations are currently being held in abeyance.

Presently, the OFCCP retains authority to investigate discrimination complaints filed under Section 503 of the Rehabilitation Act (Section 503) and the Vietnam Era Veterans’ Readjustment Assistance Act (VEVRAA). However, given the current administration’s focus on deregulation and the recent proposed budget that would effectively eliminate the OFCCP, this moratorium extension likely reflects the need to address the previous May 2025 expiration date, rather than an indication that the agency is ramping up its activities.

This extension represents the latest in a series of actions dating back to 2014, when the OFCCP first limited its enforcement activities for TRICARE subcontractors in an effort to balance regulatory requirements and veterans’ access to healthcare, allowing for more time to consider stakeholder feedback. The moratorium was later expanded to include VAHBP providers. Effective August 31 2020, OFCCP’s final rule established that it does not have authority over TRICARE providers. The current moratorium extension provides additional time for the OFCCP to develop sub-regulatory guidance specifically addressing VAHBP providers.

While the extension offers some regulatory relief, VAHBP providers must remain aware that the moratorium does not exempt them from nondiscrimination obligations.

We will continue to monitor OFCCP developments and administrative activities for updates.

ICYMI: Murray Sounds Alarm on Chronic Staffing Shortages at Naval Hospital Bremerton, Presses for Answers from Defense Health Agency

***WATCH: Senator Murray’s questioning***

Washington, D.C. — Today, at a Senate Appropriations Defense Subcommittee hearing on the President’s fiscal year 2026 budget request for the Department of the Navy, U.S. Senator Patty Murray (D-WA), Vice Chair of the Senate Appropriations Committee, questioned Secretary of the Navy John C. Phelan and Acting Chief of Naval Operations Admiral James W. Kilby about the Trump administration’s litmus tests to hire for civilian roles, staffing cuts at Naval Hospital Bremerton, and frigate production.

[CIVILIAN STAFFING]

Senator Murray began her questioning by addressing how OPM has encouraged federal workers across the country to leave their jobs, including civilian workers that support key installations and operations, stating: “Puget Sound Naval Shipyard, located in my home state of Washington, is one of the largest shipyards in the country, and the only shipyard on the entire west coast that can dry dock Nimitz Class aircraft carriers. It’s a huge asset to the Navy and the overall Indo-Pacific strategy. Right now, PSNS is undergoing important renovations to address seismic vulnerabilities and prepare for the new Ford Class aircraft carriers. This administration, however, is actively encouraging our shipbuilders to leave their jobs and putting up absurd barriers to hiring new civilian workers. Almost 2,000 naval shipyard workers have already taken the deferred resignation under the threat of looming mass layoffs. And Trump’s Office of Personnel Management is insisting on approving civilians one-by-one, which is creating massive slowdowns and ballooning waitlists to hire the workers that we need at every base in this country. And on top of that, on May 29th, OPM added a requirement for new civilian nonpartisan hires to write about how they would ‘advance the President’s Executive Orders and policy priorities’ as part of the application process.”

“Secretary Phelan, how does a welder’s fluency in, or support of Trump’s Executive Orders relate to their qualifications as a welder?” asked Senator Murray.

Secretary Phelan answered, “I did visit Puget Sound and saw a lot of the impressive work that was done there. As to your question on—I believe what you're referring to is the civilian loyalty oath—and my understanding is the Department of the Navy continues to use the same appointment affidavit it's been using since 2002 for civilian hires. And we are waiting for guidance from the Department of Defense as it relates to any revisions.”

Senator Murray pressed, “Well will you push back on OPM’s political purity tests, and object to them individually approving civilian hires?”

“I will have to wait to see what it is they recommend before I can tell you that,” Secretary Phelan responded.

“Well from my position, a nonpartisan government hire should not need to articulate which Trump policy they like best just to get hired. And a welder should not need to share their favorite Trump Executive Order. This is putting us behind. So, I just think this is something that we all need to take notice of. And I hope, as you get your guidance, that you push back on that,” said Senator Murray.

[NAVAL HOSPITAL BREMERTON]

Senator Murray continued her questioning by turning to the issue of staffing cuts at Naval Hospital Bremerton (NHB) completely eliminating on-base health care for servicemembers and their family at Naval Base Kitsap: “Naval Base Kitsap, also in my state, is the third largest Navy base in the United States. It’s home to 15,000 servicemembers, nearly 18,000 family members and retirees. But since 2022, the Defense Health Agency has repeatedly ordered the base’s hospital to cut critical staff and medical care—which has been devastating for our servicemembers and their families’ access to health care. Right now, in fact, Naval Hospital Bremerton’s Internal Medicine department has no—zero—physicians for over 2,000 patients. Instead of hiring anyone, DHA is forcing patients to travel over an hour, on a good day, each way, to Madigan Army Medical Center at Joint Base Lewis-McChord. Mr. Secretary, this is just unacceptable.”

Senator Murray asked, “Can you fill me in on what the Navy is doing to fill those vacancies at Bremerton?”

“As you know, I've been visiting a number of different installations of ours, and from some of the conditions of the barracks to some of the conditions in the medical facilities, et cetera, we have issues at most of them. On that specific one I'm going to have to get back to you and get some more detail on it. Which, I will do,” Secretary Phelan responded.

“Admiral, do you have anything to add?” Senator Murray asked Admiral Kilby.

Admiral Kilby replied, “I agree with your assessment ma'am, there are challenges with DHA across the board, for the Navy. And we're working, like all the other services, to make sure we're providing the best health care we can for our servicemembers and our families.”

“This is a readiness issue. It's a retention issue. It's personal for these families. So please, if you could get back to me about what steps we are going to take to fix this,” said Senator Murray.

[NAVAL STATION EVERETT FRIGATES]

Senator Murray then asked about years of delays on frigate production, stating: “Finally, let me ask you about Naval Station Everett. It was designated as the home station for the new class of Frigates in 2022. However, the design delays have postponed production for the last three years. I understand you and the Department leadership are considering several options for the future of the Constellation-class frigate—and I’d emphasize this committee needs the budget details to put this bill together. So, if you can make sure we have that and talk for a minute about what you see as the implications for Everett under the different scenarios the Department might propose for the frigate program.”

Secretary Phelan replied, “Let me take that one from the record and come back to you.”

“I would appreciate the response to that. Thank you very much,” concluded Senator Murray.

Maybe you’re planning to spend time at the pool, go to a barbecue, or take a vacation. But don’t take a vacation from your health this summer.

“Now can be a great time for you and your family to catch up on preventive health care and take care of other health needs,” said Jeannine Pickrell, M.S., RN, director for Population Health and Disease Management, TRICARE Health Plan, at the Defense Health Agency.

Here are four suggested ways you can use your TRICARE benefits this summer.

1. Get preventive care

Getting regular preventive care plays a key role in maintaining good health. That’s because preventive services catch problems before you show symptoms. Examples of preventive services include cancer screenings, immunizations, and Health Promotion and Disease Prevention exams.

Which preventive services do you need? Talk to your primary care manager or provider or check out TRICARE’s list of covered preventive services to learn more. Your age, sex, family history, and other risk factors play a role in which services are recommended for you.

You’ll have no out-of-pocket costs for TRICARE covered preventive services if you see a TRICARE network provider, as described in the TRICARE Costs and Fees Sheet. (Active duty service members need pre-authorization to see civilian providers.) TRICARE Prime and TRICARE Select cover one HP&DP exam annually. Learn more about getting preventive care with your TRICARE plan.

2. Get ready for back to school

Summer is a great time to take care of health checkups for your kids. Your child’s school likely requires students to get an annual health exam and be up to date on vaccines.

TRICARE covers physicals required for school enrollment. Check with your child’s school for their health policy. Depending on these requirements, you may need to schedule more than one office visit for your child, so don’t wait until the last minute to make an appointment.

TRICARE doesn’t cover annual sports physicals, which are separate from school physicals.

Even if your child’s school doesn’t require a physical, kids can still get preventive checkups. Annual HP&DP exams are available to TRICARE enrollees ages 6 and older. TRICARE also covers well-child exams from birth through age 5.

3. Take care of your eyes

Routine eye exams are designed to monitor your eyesight and catch any eye diseases early.

Your TRICARE health plan may cover routine eye exams. Your vision coverage depends on who you are, your plan, and your age.

Check out these pages for more information about eye exams and vision coverage:

Eye Exams for Active Duty Service Members

Eye Exams for Active Duty Family Members

Eye Exams for National Guard and Reserve Members and Their Families

Eye Exams for Retirees, Their Families, and All Others

Do you need additional vision coverage, like coverage for glasses or contacts? You may be eligible for vision coverage through the Federal Employees Dental and Vision Insurance Program. If you aren’t enrolled in a FEDVIP vision plan, you can enroll following a FEDVIP qualifying life event or during Federal Benefits Open Season each fall. (Keep in mind that FEDVIP QLEs are different from TRICARE QLEs.) Go to BENEFEDS.gov to learn more about FEDVIP eligibility and coverage.

4. Focus on your mental health

Your mental health is an important part of your overall health and well-being. You don’t need to be in crisis to seek help. Early intervention is key to addressing mental health concerns. Early signs of possible problems may include:

Eating or sleeping too much or too little

Pulling away from people and usual activities

Having low or no energy

Having trouble concentrating

Feeling numb or like nothing matters

Experiencing unexplained aches and pains

Feeling hopeless or helpless

Smoking or drinking more than usual

TRICARE covers a range of mental health services. Services are available whether you’re seeking support for the short or long term. You can start by:

Talking to your PCM — depending on your health plan and the type of care you get, you may need a referral or pre-authorization for mental health care.
