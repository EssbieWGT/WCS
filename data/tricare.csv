Zynex, headquartered in Englewood, CO, is a medical device company that makes electrotherapy devices for pain management and rehabilitation.

According to the lawsuit, Defendants failed to disclose to investors that: (1) Zynex shipped products, including electrodes, in excess of demand; (2) as a result, Zynex was able to inflate its revenue; (3) the Company's practice of filing false claims drew scrutiny from insurers, including Tricare; and (4) thus, it was reasonably likely that Zynex would face adverse consequences, including removal from insurer networks and penalties from the federal government.

On June 4, 2024, medical journal STAT published a report titled ""How a device maker inundated pain patients with unwanted batteries and surprise bills,"" which claimed that Zynex engaged in an ""oversupplying scheme"" by sending inordinate amounts of supplies, such as electrode pads and batteries, in order to ""bill insurers for thousands of dollars more than it otherwise could."" The report further revealed that, as a result of this practice, insurers were ""kicking the company out of network.""

On this news, Zynex's stock price fell $0.50 per share, or 5%, to close at $9.35 per share on June 4, 2024.

On March 11, 2025, Zynex reported Q4 and full-year 2024 financial results, revealing a significant revenue ""shortfall"" in the quarter ""due to slower than normal payments from certain payers."" Zynex further revealed ""Tricare [health insurance program for the U.S. military] has temporarily suspended payments as they review prior claims.""

On this news, Zynex's stock price fell $3.59 per share, or 51%, to close at $3.41 per share on March 12, 2025.

A lead plaintiff is a representative party who acts on behalf of all class members in directing the litigation. The lead plaintiff is usually the investor or small group of investors who have the largest financial interest and who are also adequate and typical of the proposed class of investors. The lead plaintiff selects counsel to represent the lead plaintiff and the class and these attorneys, if approved by the court, are lead or class counsel. Your ability to share in any recovery is not, however, affected by the decision whether or not to serve as a lead plaintiff. Communicating with any counsel is not necessary to participate or share in any recovery achieved in this case. Any member of the purported class may move the Court to serve as a lead plaintiff through counsel of his/her choice, or may choose to do nothing and remain an inactive class member.

Currently, Island Health collects approximate $3.4M in funding from the district’s taxpayers, which is less than 3% of the hospital district’s total revenue.

The proposed new levy could bring in an additional $4 million dollars a year.

The levy would add 41 cents per $1,000 assessed valuation to the current levy of 34 cents for a total of 75 cents per $1,000 valuation. A separate bond levy of 27 cents per $1,000 for construction of the hospital in 2004 will die in 2028.

“With the rising costs of healthcare supplies and labor, expenses have outpaced revenue since the COVID-19 pandemic began in 2020. For example, in 2024, it cost over $330,000 per day ($122M per year) to operate Island Health— a 21% increase over pre-pandemic expenses in 2020,” the news release says.

Island Health says the levy would provide funding for the equipment and facility improvements needed to increase access to critical healthcare services in our rural community, such as 24/7 emergency and intensive care, as well as expand access to specialized care such as cardiology, mental health, obstetrics, orthopedics, pulmonology, senior care and urology.",https://www.anacortesnow.com/images/stories/2025/2024-0407-island-health-1.jpg,N,0.0,2025-04-07 20:56:16.802813

Zynex’s Disappointing Fourth Quarter Results

ZYXI share price depression stems from its disastrous 4Q 2024 earnings release. The Englewood, Colorado-based firm reported fourth-quarter 2024 revenue of $46.0 million, a roughly 2% year-over-year decline, falling short of Wall Street's expectations. The company also swung to a net loss of $0.02 per share, a stark contrast to the $0.04 net income per share reported in the same period last year.

The disappointing results reportedly prompted RBC Capital Markets to downgrade Zynex to Sector Perform from Outperform. According to news outlets, in a report to its clients, RBC analyst Shagun Singh cited a ""lack of visibility"" into the company's operations and commercial outlook, particularly concerning its relationship with Tricare, the military health program that represents a significant portion of Zynex's revenue.

Singh reportedly noted that Tricare, Zynex's largest customer, has temporarily suspended payments amid an ongoing review of prior claims. Singh added that the company's decision to withhold 2025 guidance and implement a 15% workforce reduction further compounded investor concerns. Singh revised RBC’s price target for Zynex shares to $5.50, down from $11.00, warning of a potential ""domino effect"" stemming from Tricare's payment suspension.

Zynex Securities Class Action

Adding to Zynex’s woes, a securities class action lawsuit has been filed in the District Court of Colorado, alleging that the company made false and misleading statements regarding its revenue recognition practices and its relationship with Tricare. The suit, captioned Tuncel v. Zynex, Inc., et al., seeks to represent investors who purchased Zynex securities between March 13, 2023, and March 11, 2025.

The complaint alleges that Zynex engaged in “oversupplying” customers with products, including electrodes, leading to inflated revenue figures. It further claims that this practice drew scrutiny from insurers, including Tricare, and that Zynex failed to disclose the potential for adverse consequences, such as removal from insurer networks and government penalties.

According to the complaint, revelations of Zynex's alleged practices surfaced with a June 4, 2024 report by medical journal STAAT detailing an ""oversupplying scheme"" involving excessive shipments of supplies and subsequent inflated billing. The report also indicated that insurers were ""kicking the company out of network.""

The truth allegedly emerged on March 11, 2025, when Zynex reported its dismal Q4 and FY 2024 financial results. The complaint highlights Zynex CEO Thomas Sandgaard’s attributing the fourth-quarter revenue shortfall to ""slower than normal payments from certain payers"" and the Tricare payment suspension.

Hagens Berman’s Investigation

Hagens Berman is investigating the alleged claims. “We are examining Zynex's financial reporting and business practices. We believe investors deserve a complete and transparent understanding of these events,” said Reed Kathrein, the Hagens Berman Partner leading the firm's probe.

DHA is the federal agency that oversees medical services for the military, currently headquartered in Falls Church, Virginia.
South Beach Project would consolidate some assets and thousands of workers currently scattered in facilities throughout the greater San Antonio area, a DHA spokesman said in 2023, and also allow the agency to manage selected skill sets and functions in one central location.
“Once completed, the DHA / South Beach renovation project will house over 1,000 DHA employees who will be dedicated to the mission of improving health and business readiness here at [Joint Base San Antonio] and the nation’s Joint Military Force.” Original plans date back to 2005, the document says, and a cost update for renovating a four-story building known as South Beach Pavilion is needed.

DHA is the federal agency that oversees medical services for the military, currently headquartered in Falls Church, Virginia.

Established in 2013, the agency manages all military hospitals and clinics and the TRICARE network, employs tens of thousands of civilians and military service members worldwide.

South Beach Project would consolidate some assets and thousands of workers currently scattered in facilities throughout the greater San Antonio area, a DHA spokesman said in 2023, and also allow the agency to manage selected skill sets and functions in one central location.

But San Antonio and Bexar County have long been engaged in an effort to turn the region into a military medical mecca — one that could potentially involve state economic development grants as well.

“We are Military City USA but we are also quickly becoming, if not already, Military Medicine City USA,” Commissioner Grant Moody (Pct. 3) said at a Commissioners Court meeting in December 2023. “With additional DHA employees coming to San Antonio, we’re going to continue to expand and bring additional resources and additional missions here to San Antonio, and I think there’s a lot of synergies that come with that.”

In perhaps the clearest signal yet of their plans, an agenda document from Tuesday’s Bexar County Commissioners Court meeting says the county is engaging an architect to put together plans for a building renovation for DHA at Fort Sam Houston.

“Once completed, the DHA / South Beach renovation project will house over 1,000 DHA employees who will be dedicated to the mission of improving health and business readiness here at [Joint Base San Antonio] and the nation’s Joint Military Force.”

Original plans date back to 2005, the document says, and a cost update for renovating a four-story building known as South Beach Pavilion is needed. The original $30 million plan was based on $10 million contributions from both the city and county, as well as $10,000 in state grants that haven’t yet been applied for.

Also known as Fort Sam Houston Building 2371, the buildings were built in 1931 and converted into a hospital during World War II.

“This project, with funding from three different entities, is intended to be both an economic impact project, as well as help the overall mission of JBSA.”

Zynex’s Disappointing Fourth Quarter Results

ZYXI share price depression stems from its disastrous 4Q 2024 earnings release. The Englewood, Colorado-based firm reported fourth-quarter 2024 revenue of $46.0 million, a roughly 2% year-over-year decline, falling short of Wall Street's expectations. The company also swung to a net loss of $0.02 per share, a stark contrast to the $0.04 net income per share reported in the same period last year.

The disappointing results reportedly prompted RBC Capital Markets to downgrade Zynex to Sector Perform from Outperform. According to news outlets, in a report to its clients, RBC analyst Shagun Singh cited a ""lack of visibility"" into the company's operations and commercial outlook, particularly concerning its relationship with Tricare, the military health program that represents a significant portion of Zynex's revenue.

Singh reportedly noted that Tricare, Zynex's largest customer, has temporarily suspended payments amid an ongoing review of prior claims. Singh added that the company's decision to withhold 2025 guidance and implement a 15% workforce reduction further compounded investor concerns. Singh revised RBC’s price target for Zynex shares to $5.50, down from $11.00, warning of a potential ""domino effect"" stemming from Tricare's payment suspension.

Zynex Securities Class Action

Adding to Zynex’s woes, a securities class action lawsuit has been filed in the District Court of Colorado, alleging that the company made false and misleading statements regarding its revenue recognition practices and its relationship with Tricare. The suit, captioned Tuncel v. Zynex, Inc., et al., seeks to represent investors who purchased Zynex securities between March 13, 2023, and March 11, 2025.

The complaint alleges that Zynex engaged in “oversupplying” customers with products, including electrodes, leading to inflated revenue figures. It further claims that this practice drew scrutiny from insurers, including Tricare, and that Zynex failed to disclose the potential for adverse consequences, such as removal from insurer networks and government penalties.

According to the complaint, revelations of Zynex's alleged practices surfaced with a June 4, 2024 report by medical journal STAAT detailing an ""oversupplying scheme"" involving excessive shipments of supplies and subsequent inflated billing. The report also indicated that insurers were ""kicking the company out of network.""

The truth allegedly emerged on March 11, 2025, when Zynex reported its dismal Q4 and FY 2024 financial results. The complaint highlights Zynex CEO Thomas Sandgaard’s attributing the fourth-quarter revenue shortfall to ""slower than normal payments from certain payers"" and the Tricare payment suspension.

Hagens Berman’s Investigation

Hagens Berman is investigating the alleged claims. “We are examining Zynex's financial reporting and business practices. We believe investors deserve a complete and transparent understanding of these events,” said Reed Kathrein, the Hagens Berman Partner leading the firm's probe.

You read that right: 87,000 hours.

That’s equivalent to 3,625 days, almost a full man-hour decade.

Burned up by staffers tending to their own interests, to the detriment of the troops they’re nominally charged with helping and the taxpayers they’re answerable to: They spent those hours doing things like contract renegotiation and fringe-benefit squeeze-outs.

This info comes in a bombshell new report unearthed by Sen. Joni Ernst (R-Iowa), a veteran and a fierce advocate for the troops as well as a staunch fighter against fraud and waste as head of the Senate DOGE caucus.

Good: The more sunlight into government spending, the better.

Otherwise, there’s no way to ever know which handouts serve to advance America’s national interest and which line the pockets of powerful fiefdoms and their lords.

But it points to a bigger problem, i.e., that public-sector unions are bad news for everyone.

In the private sector, unionized workers use their collective power to win concessions from business owners. If that gums up the works too much, the company suffers and its customers and investors go elsewhere.

Government doesn’t work that way: The dissatisfied can’t escape so easily, and it’s politicians and other officials with no personal skin in the game who make the concessions.

And unionized government workers put the squeeze directly on you.

Every benefit, every pay hike, every extra comes out of the taxpayer’s pocket.

And by shielding the incompetent and criminal, stifling innovation and generally gumming up the works, public-sector unions screw over the people most dependent on government services.

That is, the poor, the disabled and the otherwise marginalized.

Even, in this case, the armed forces.

So the next time National Education Association head Becky Pringle starts in on one of her semi-comprehensible tirades about justice and equity, or any other municipal, state or federal public-union muckamuck throws a weepy, righteous temper tantrum — remember.

The only thing they want is to shove their hand deeper into your pocket.",https://nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/04/general-view-pentagon-reported-billionaire-100854954.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&w=1024,N,-1.0,2025-04-07 13:56:22.116681

Of the $3.3 million spent on “union time,” about $190,000 was spent on negotiating a labor contract for workers at the agency since April 2023.

The Trump administration has since directed federal agencies to furnish that information.","Federal workers tasked with taking care of the men and women in the military spent 87,000 hours and $3.3 million taking care of their own union benefits — and taxpayers footed the bill, The Post has learned.

During fiscal years 2023 and 2024, union staffers at the Defense Health Agency (DHA) — which oversees the TRICARE health benefits for US troops — charged the federal government for the time they spent working on contract negotiations, eking out fringe benefits and other union duties, according to a report obtained by Sen. Joni Ernst’s (R-Iowa) office.

Of the $3.3 million spent on “union time,” about $190,000 was spent on negotiating a labor contract for workers at the agency since April 2023.

“During this period our agency was undergoing a significant transition aimed at stabilizing and enhancing our labor relations process,” DHA said when asked about the large expense.

At the time, only about 36% of seats at the agency’s headquarters were occupied, according to the findings.

DHA’s multimillion expenses on taxpayer-funded union time is the largest figure that Ernst’s office has released during its investigation of the use of taxpayer resources on union-related expenses across federal agencies.

Ernst, an Army veteran and leader of the Senate DOGE caucus, has been probing federal agency use of taxpayer-funded union time and previously championed legislation requiring federal workers to reimburse the government for time and resources spent on union activities.

“This report on the Defense Health Agency highlights everything that’s wrong with the federal workforce,” Ernst told The Post.

“Taxpayers were subsidizing more than $3 million of union activities while the D.C. headquarters sat at just 36% occupancy. Bureaucrats should serve the American people, not themselves.”

Other agencies had significantly lower spending on taxpayer-funded union time. NASA spent about $400,000 last year, while the Nuclear Regulatory Commission spent about $420,000 on it in 2024.

Federal unions are restricted from negotiating benefits and pay by the Federal Service Labor Management Relations Statute. Instead, benefits and pay are determined by law set by Congress and federal regulations.

But federal unions can negotiate over more minor aspects of working conditions.

“This includes things like the height of cubicle panels, securing designated smoking areas on otherwise smoke-free campuses, and the right to wear Spandex at work,” Rachel Greszler, a senior research fellow on workforce and public finance at the Heritage Foundation, previously told The Post.

Back in 2019, the Office of Personnel Management released comprehensive data on taxpayer-funded union time and concluded that the entire federal government had spent at least $135 million on it that year.

After 2019, OPM stopped tracking that data.

Back in February, Ernst requested data from 24 federal agencies. The Trump administration has since directed federal agencies to furnish that information.

The Post reached out to both DHA and its union for comment.",https://nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/04/newspress-collage-aemf359gf-1743784728775.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&1743770372&w=1024,N,0.0,2025-04-06 16:56:16.982884

Catastrophic cap is $1,200 something with Tricare and then all you have to pay is your monthly premium.

From my experience Tricare Reserve Select does a better job with coverage than many others. My wife’s company provided United Healthcare and when she became ill they refused to provide coverage for her therapy, fortunately she was also on TRS and they covered it without question. She is alive today only bc of TRS and at present this is the only reason I remain in the Guard. If you are single, you can’t beat the price for this level of care.

My son got diagnosed with cancer back in November. Catastrophic cap is $1,200 something with Tricare and then all you have to pay is your monthly premium. Tricare has paid out over $500,000 for his treatments among other things (last I checked, its probably more now). Yes, I highly recommend you keep Tricare. I don't worry about insurance stuff which has taken the burden off me about money, so I can actually focus on taking care of my son. I hope nobody else ever runs into this, but I always put this out when this question is asked so Soldiers know how good of an insurance it is.",,N,1.0,2025-04-05 15:56:16.649940

Maj. Troy E. Black, Senior Enlisted Advisor to the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, told a room full of Defense Health Agency staff while pointing to the American flag.

In a town hall meeting, Black told staff at the Defense Health Headquarters in Falls Church, Virginia, the military operates at a “strategic level now, talking about what happens when nation states go to war, and how do we understand the scope and the scale of that? “History is 100% accurate, no matter how we want to read it,” Black added. “There will be another conflict or war. They will go to scale.”

Black said the U.S. military needs to be ready for large-scale conflict like America hasn’t seen since World War II, including to ensure its medical system–military and civilian–is prepared for large and continuous waves of wounded.

He said DHA must proactively align its efforts with the changing character of warfare and the military's needs, rather than waiting for direction. He also noted the importance of close collaboration with the services and combatant commands to understand their evolving requirements and ensure DHA is prepared to provide necessary combat support.

Black emphasized the importance of standardizing medical treatment and casualty care across the services to ensure common standards of care, and the need to assess capabilities and resources to support high-casualty scenarios.

Underscoring the need to collaborate across the services, Black said, “All service branches do it differently. All have different equipment. All have different links of training to meet the same requirement or additional requirements. All do different platforms in a different uniform all the different ways,” adding, “We have to be focused on how we save a human being at the point of injury under fire by an adversary.”

First and foremost, Black stressed, is the need for service members to be ready to fight at a moment’s notice. He reiterated the need to come together to support the warfighter, as “you're dealing with the one thing: preservation of life.”

Black concluded by reminding everyone, “It’s not all bad news! Remember this: We win.”",https://dha.mil/-/media/Project/Images/News-Images/8952221.jpg,N,0.0,2025-04-05 13:56:29.325561
