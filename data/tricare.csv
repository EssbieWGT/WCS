Both times they told me 15 day turn around but when I call, they tell me that doesn't take into account post office hold ups/weather/etc. But they also can't tell me anything else, like when it was sent (obviously my request from April never made it to me, so the weather must have eaten it). They tell me to just to wait more. This doesn't feel right. I'm not asking for anything crazy. I have evidence of my requests from April and June.

The alert came a day after the U.S. announced it bombed multiple nuclear sites in Iran, with President Trump warning of further strikes if Iran retaliates. The U.S. carried out the strikes a little over a week after Israel launched a broad attack on Iran, its top regional rival.

The State Department alert noted that the Middle East conflict has caused travel disruptions and “periodic” airspace closures across the region and also warned of “the potential for demonstrations against U.S. citizens and interests abroad.”

The State Department is urging citizens to check travel advisories and security alerts before traveling abroad.

Understanding Your TRICARE Plan

To maximize your TRICARE benefits, it's essential to understand your plan and its associated costs. TRICARE offers several plans, each with its unique features and benefits.

Choosing the Right TRICARE Plan for Your Needs

When selecting a TRICARE plan, consider the following factors:

Your health needs: If you have ongoing medical conditions or require frequent medical care, TRICARE Prime may be the best option. If you're generally healthy and only require occasional medical care, TRICARE Select may be more suitable.

Your budget: TRICARE Prime typically has lower out-of-pocket costs, but requires a yearly enrollment fee. TRICARE Select has higher out-of-pocket costs, but offers more flexibility in choosing providers.

Your location: If you live in a remote area, TRICARE Select may be a better option, as it allows you to see any TRICARE-authorized provider.

Understanding the Differences Between TRICARE Prime, TRICARE Select, and TRICARE For Life

Here's a brief overview of each plan:

Plan Description Eligibility TRICARE Prime A managed care plan that requires enrollment and a primary care manager (PCM) Active duty service members, retirees, and their families TRICARE Select A fee-for-service plan that allows you to see any TRICARE-authorized provider Active duty service members, retirees, and their families TRICARE For Life A Medicare wraparound coverage plan for TRICARE beneficiaries with Medicare Parts A and B Medicare-eligible TRICARE beneficiaries

Tips for Navigating the TRICARE Claims Process

To ensure smooth claims processing, follow these tips:

Keep accurate records of your medical appointments and expenses

Verify your provider is TRICARE-authorized

Submit claims promptly, as there's a one-year filing deadline

Use the TRICARE Online Patient Portal to track your claims and manage your account

Accessing Specialized Care

TRICARE offers access to specialized care, including specialty care services like cardiology, oncology, and mental health.

How to Access Specialty Care Through TRICARE

To access specialty care, follow these steps:

Consult with your primary care manager (PCM) or healthcare provider to determine the best course of treatment.

Obtain a referral from your PCM or healthcare provider to see a specialist.

Verify the specialist is TRICARE-authorized and participating in the TRICARE network.

Schedule an appointment with the specialist.

Understanding the Process for Referrals and Authorizations

TRICARE requires referrals and authorizations for certain services, including specialty care. Here's what you need to know:

Your PCM or healthcare provider will typically initiate the referral process.

TRICARE will review the referral and determine if the requested service is medically necessary.

If approved, you'll receive an authorization number, which you'll need to provide to the specialist.

Tips for Finding TRICARE-Approved Providers

To find TRICARE-approved providers, use the TRICARE Provider Directory or contact the TRICARE Regional Office in your area. You can also ask your PCM or healthcare provider for recommendations.

Managing Out-of-Pocket Costs

While TRICARE provides comprehensive coverage, you'll still incur out-of-pocket costs, including copays, deductibles, and coinsurance.

Strategies for Reducing Copays and Deductibles

To minimize your out-of-pocket costs, consider the following strategies:

Use TRICARE-authorized providers, as they typically have negotiated rates with TRICARE.

Take advantage of preventive care services, which are often covered at no cost to you.

Use the TRICARE Pharmacy Home Delivery service for maintenance medications.

Consider using a Flexible Spending Account (FSA) or Health Savings Account (HSA) to set aside pre-tax dollars for medical expenses.

Understanding TRICARE's Catastrophic Cap and How to Reach It

TRICARE's catastrophic cap is the maximum amount you'll pay out-of-pocket for covered services in a given year. For 2023, the catastrophic cap is $3,000 for TRICARE Prime families and $4,500 for TRICARE Select families 1.

To reach the catastrophic cap, you'll need to accumulate allowable charges, including copays, deductibles, and coinsurance. Once you reach the cap, TRICARE will cover 100% of allowable charges for the remainder of the year.

The following equation illustrates how to calculate your out-of-pocket costs:

Out-of-Pocket Costs=Copays+Deductibles+Coinsurance \text{Out-of-Pocket Costs} = \text{Copays} + \text{Deductibles} + \text{Coinsurance} Out-of-Pocket Costs=Copays+Deductibles+Coinsurance

For example, if you have a $500 deductible, $1,000 in copays, and $1,500 in coinsurance, your total out-of-pocket costs would be:

Out-of-Pocket Costs=USD500+USD1,000+USD1,500=USD3,000 \text{Out-of-Pocket Costs} = $500 + $1,000 + $1,500 = $3,000 Out-of-Pocket Costs=U​SD5​00+U​SD1​,000+U​SD1​,500=U​SD3​,000

Tips for Managing Out-of-Pocket Costs for Prescriptions and Other Expenses

To minimize your out-of-pocket costs for prescriptions and other expenses, consider the following tips:

Use the TRICARE Pharmacy Home Delivery service for maintenance medications, as it often offers discounted rates.

Use generic or formulary medications when possible.

Take advantage of cost-sharing programs, such as the TRICARE Pharmacy Copayment Waiver.

Consider using a mail-order pharmacy or online pharmacy that participates in the TRICARE network.

Conclusion

Maximizing your TRICARE benefits requires understanding your plan, accessing specialized care, and managing out-of-pocket costs. By following the tips and strategies outlined in this article, you'll be able to get the most out of your military healthcare coverage.

This group establishes unified, high-quality standards for perioperative services across all hospitals and clinics within the Military Health System. By creating the same rules and processes for all operating rooms, the DHA ORESC helps the MHS deliver safe and high-quality care to beneficiaries.

What Is the DHA ORESC?

The DHA ORESC is a team of surgeons, nurses, and anesthesiologists from all nine defense health networks. Their job is to equip ORs with the resourcing and guidance to meet the needs of patients.

“As a nurse nominee, being part of the ORESC ensures that the voices of the nursing staff are heard in key decisions,” said Natalee Day, chief nurse of William Beaumont Army Medical Center – Fort Bliss. “I have the opportunity to advocate for processes that directly impact our team and patient care.”

How the DHA ORESC Works

The DHA ORESC acts as a central decision-making body to standardize processes across the MHS. Members from every DHN share ideas and challenges from their military hospitals and clinics. This teamwork helps create standards that work for most military hospitals and clinics and advance the larger goals of the MHS.

The DHA ORESC also focuses on accountability. U.S. Air Force Lt. Col. Robert McGill, orthopaedic arthroplasty surgeon and DHA’s Surgical Clinical Management Team chief serving as the acting DHA ORESC chair said the committee:

• Hears concerns

• Shares successes

• Leads policy decision making

Every DHN receives one vote for decision making. These decisions improve patient safety and quality of care while also enhancing military medical readiness and resource use.

“By centralizing decision making and standardizing processes, the DHA ORESC ensures that every facility within the MHS knows the steps to operate at the highest level of efficiency and safety,” McGill explained.

Why the DHA ORESC is Important

The DHA ORESC’s work has big benefits:

• Safer surgeries: By creating perioperative best practices, the DHA ORESC makes sure all patients get safe, high-quality care.

• Faster decisions: The group’s clear structure helps solve problems quickly while keeping everyone accountable.

• Better use of resources: Consistent processes and good planning help military hospitals and clinics meet patient needs and keep service members ready.

“The ORESC’s initiatives not only improve surgical care, but also strengthen the overall readiness of our military health care system,” said Dr. Adrienne Cummings, deputy chair of the department of anesthesia at Brooke Army Medical Center. “It’s a win for patients, providers, and the mission.”

The DHA ORESC Impact

The DHA ORESC’s work supports the DHA’s goal of quality care to patients and service member readiness. By improving how military hospitals and clinics run, the DHA ORESC helps keep the military health care system strong and dependable.

“The ORESC has been an invaluable platform for sharing challenges and solutions across networks,” said U.S. Navy Capt. James Solomon, pediatric anesthesiologist, Walter Reed National Military Medical Center, “We all face similar obstacles and are at different stages in developing our network-level OR committees. By collaborating, we ensure that all networks move in the same direction toward optimizing OR operations.”

What’s Next

The DHA ORESC is committed to making surgeries safer, more efficient, and better for everyone. As the team keeps working together, its goal is for surgical care to be top-notch for both patients and providers.",https://militarymedical.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/8941392.jpg,N,1.0,2025-06-23 11:56:25.609074

Tricare will not cover elective abortions. If it’s a medically necessary procedure to save the mother’s life, yes. But then you face the hardship of somebody who will do it. Some doctors use their personal beliefs and their fear of prosecution dictate what they’ll do.

For the most part tricare covers medically necessary medical procedures.

If you choose to seek an abortion electively, that’s completely on you. Travel if necessary and the costs of the procedure.

You can also google “tricare abortion” and find the tricare website explaining.

Oh well that’s shitty! Sorry that happened to you! Sometimes people interpret things in a way we didn’t intend and then everyone runs with it 😩

So pregnant or not, you have the option of Prime vs Select. I have select, so I’m not sure how it works with prime, but I picked my own OB and birthing hospital (lmao I actually WANTED to give birth at the MTF here and they said nope, deferred to the civilian network byeeeee). I didn’t need any referrals and for the most part, they’ve covered everything — but I’m also high risk due to AMA. There’s also birth doula coverage! And def check out parenting and birthing classes offered through your nearest MTF with a birthing center.

For anyone who is wondering, I don’t think any Tricare plan covers TFMR for abnormalities not compatible with life unless they endanger the mother’s life, or the pregnancy is a result of rape or incest.

I would not ask any personal questions on the base or ship Facebook page 🙏. To protect yourself and your sailor. I know you said others do it, that's not something I've seen on any of my pages.

Long story short, I have an ankle injury that’s been bothering me for a month so I went to my Tricare Prime PCM and was scheduled for an MRI. My left leg has lost a lot of muscle and I struggle to walk.

Here’s a breakdown of what you need to know to make informed decisions about your health coverage.

CHAMPVA & Medicare Advantage

CHAMPVA (Civilian Health and Medical Program of the Department of Veterans Affairs) can serve as a secondary payer when you’re enrolled in another health plan, such as a Medicare Advantage plan. This means CHAMPVA helps cover out-of-pocket costs like deductibles, co-pays, and coinsurance after your primary plan pays.

Most healthcare providers will bill your Medicare Advantage plan first, and CHAMPVA will pick up the remaining balance. However, there are exceptions. If you're also covered by Medicaid, Indian Health Services, or certain crime victim benefits, CHAMPVA may act as your primary payer.

TRICARE For Life & Medicare Advantage

Good news for TRICARE For Life beneficiaries: enrolling in Medicare Advantage does not affect your TRICARE coverage. Medicare Advantage becomes your primary insurer, while TFL acts as a secondary payer for TRICARE-covered services.

However, unlike Original Medicare, Medicare Advantage claims do not automatically crossover to TRICARE. This means you may have to manually file claims with TRICARE For Life for reimbursement, unless your provider or Medicare Advantage Health Plan carrier is willing to submit those claims for you on your behalf.

If you receive care through the VA, you can also use Medicare Advantage, Medicaid, or private insurance. While the VA doesn’t bill Medicare, they may bill yourprivate insurance for care provided for non-service-connected conditions.

Providing your health insurance details to the VA can help reduce copayments and improve care coordination. Importantly, your insurance status doesn’t impact your eligibility for VA health care benefits.

Dear Rusty: In your answer to the retired U.S. Navy veteran about why he is forced to enroll in Medicare, you focused on military TriCare’s requirement for the member to enroll in Medicare. But you said nothing about regular VA health care. If a non-career veteran is eligible for VA health care, couldn’t that be used in place of Medicare? Signed: Veteran Advocate

Dear Veteran Advocate: Thank you for your feedback. FYI, I have previously explained numerous times that veterans who rely on the VA for 100% of their healthcare can, indeed, disenroll from Medicare Part B (thus saving the monthly Part B premium). I don’t personally recommend it because of my personal experience, but it certainly is possible to do so.

Personally, I use the VA for some of my healthcare needs – usually an annual checkup and optometry services – at my local VA clinic which is only a mile away from where I live. But for any extensive treatment needs (medical tests, etc.) I must travel about 40 miles to the nearest VA hospital facility. For contrast, I have numerous private healthcare services, specialists, and hospitals very near where I live, but to use them under the VA I must get VA preapproval and use only certain VA-approved providers, which is inconvenient for me. Personally, I prefer the freedom to go to any healthcare service provider I choose, without restriction, at any time I need to. So, I use my VA coverage when it is convenient for me but rely also on non-VA, Medicare-approved specialists who I can choose to use (or not) at will. For me, it’s a matter of convenience and the freedom to use whichever healthcare provider I want. That said, I fully understand that some veterans rely exclusively on the VA for their healthcare needs, and I have explained to many who have written to me that they have that option. I have also published several public articles about this as well.

So, please rest assured that we regularly advise our veterans about their healthcare options under Medicare, including the ability to decline Medicare Part B coverage if they have full VA healthcare coverage. FYI, free Medicare Part A (inpatient hospitalization coverage) is mandatory to collect Social Security after age 65, but Medicare Part B coverage is always optional because there is a premium associated with Part B. A veteran can decline Medicare Part B coverage and save that monthly premium, but they would need to contact Social Security to do so. Social Security will want to interview the veteran to ensure they are aware of the potential financial consequences of not having Medicare Part B. And they may need to file form CMS-1763 (Request for Termination) But a non-career veteran can opt out of Medicare Part B if they get all of their healthcare services through the Veterans Administration.",https://jocoreport.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Social-Security-Ask-Rusty-10-04-18CP-1.jpg,N,0.0,2025-06-22 13:56:15.784746

I thought id be getting out today but turns out that its going to be longer. At least Mon, but they arent sure. Im here because of some complications that put me at risk of a preterm labor, and the fact they found a shorten cervix. A couple of the issues have been resolved I think, but one is still being monitored. My cervix has shortened more within less than 24 hours.

My question is how much can tricare help pay for this? I run a huge risk of leaving too early because if I cramp and get contractions again I can't take the steroids that helped this time for another weeks or two ( Im sorry I can't remember how long. Im really overwhelmed). I need to know how much I could potentially be paying out of pocket if I stay until Monday or even for as long as they need.

""When we ensure fair, competitive pricing for military healthcare, we strengthen both our commitment to those who serve and our responsibility to ourselves as taxpayers.","Pharmacists United for Truth and Transparency calls for national conversation on massive price differences between cash-pay generics and Tricare PBM charges

(PHOENIX, AZ) – [JUNE 16, 2025] – Pharmacists United for Truth and Transparency (PUTT) today announced the launch of its ""Audit TRICARE"" campaign (AuditTRICARE.org), a critical initiative designed to bring transparency to questionable pharmacy benefit manager (PBM) pricing practices that may be costing taxpayers millions while affecting healthcare access for military families.

Using real-time pricing examples and state-based infographics, the campaign aims to start a national conversation about the stark price differences between common generic medications purchased without insurance and the prices charged to the federal government by TRICARE's PBM, Express Scripts. PUTT members whose families are on TRICARE or TRICARE for Life, sourced drug pricing information through TRICARE’s prescription drug pricing portal, comparing the cost of generic medications on TRICARE versus without insurance at pharmacies like Mark Cuban Cost Plus Drugs, Blueberry Pharmacy and DiRx, who provide their medication cash price online.

Exposing Hidden Healthcare Costs

PUTT's preliminary research revealed significant disparities in generic medication pricing that demand immediate attention:

Amlodipine, a commonly prescribed generic blood pressure medication, costs $213.60 on Tricare but less than $6 for the same medication (dose and quantity) at Mark Cuban Cost Plus Drugs

Fluoxetine, the generic version of Prozac®, costs $235.32 on Tricare but $7.74 for the same medication at Blueberry Pharmacy

Omeprazole, a commonly prescribed acid reflux medication, costs $665.58 on Tricare but $14.06 at DiRx

“While civilians can often purchase common generic medications at competitive cash prices, the federal government—through TRICARE—appears to be paying substantially more for identical medications through Express Scripts' managed formulary system,” said PUTT Executive Director Monique Whitney, whose family members’ military service includes the Marines and the Navy. ""This creates a troubling situation where the government serves as both the plan sponsor funding these purchases and the entity responsible for oversight, yet lacks transparency mechanisms to ensure fair pricing. We urge the Department of Defense to conduct an independent audit of TRICARE’s prescription drug program to understand why our military’s prescription medications are so expensive.”

Campaign Objectives

Through the ""Audit TRICARE"" campaign, PUTT aims to:

Demand Transparency: Call for clear, public reporting on the factors contributing to the prescription drug pricing within the TRICARE system, including detailed breakdowns of PBM fees, rebates, and administrative costs

Encourage Oversight: Advocate for federal agencies to regularly and independently audit PBM pricing practices to ensure competitive, fair pricing for generic medications

Protect Military Families: Ensure healthcare decisions - including the patient’s choice of pharmacy - are based on the patient’s best interest, not profit margins or self-dealing business arrangements

Safeguard Taxpayer Dollars: At a time when the federal government is seeking greater fiscal responsibility, ensure government healthcare contractors are acting as fiduciaries, using fair pricing practices and preserving access for service members, veterans and their families

The Stakes for Military Healthcare

The prescription drug pricing disparities highlighted by the campaign have far-reaching implications:

Military families may pay significantly more for common generic medications as a way to offset somewhat lower brand medication prices on TRICARE

Taxpayers fund potentially inflated prescription costs without visibility into pricing rationale

Healthcare resources that could serve more military families may be diverted to pay for excessive PBM administrative costs

""Our military families deserve healthcare transparency, and American taxpayers deserve to know how their dollars are being spent on prescription medications,"" said PUTT’s President Deborah Keaveny, whose daughter is currently on active duty in the Middle East. ""When PBMs operate with limited oversight and zero pricing transparency, everyone loses except the middleman. There is no excuse for charging our service men and women and their families hundreds of times more for generic medications than they could purchase without TRICARE at a local pharmacy. This shouldn’t be how we say ‘thank you for your service and your sacrifices’.”

A Call for Accountability

The ""Audit TRICARE"" campaign is intended to represent more than policy advocacy. PUTT’s goal is to call for the transparency and accountability military families have earned through their service, Ms. Whitney said. PUTT invites healthcare advocates, military families, veterans, and concerned citizens to join this critical conversation.

""Transparency in healthcare pricing isn't a partisan issue—it's an American issue,"" said Brandi Chane, a pharmacy owner based in Weatherford, Texas and PUTT Board member whose mother is on TRICARE for Life. ""When we ensure fair, competitive pricing for military healthcare, we strengthen both our commitment to those who serve and our responsibility to ourselves as taxpayers. It’s the taxpayers who are funding these vital services.”
