In 1942, a California newspaper published a cartoon implying Halloween pranks were in favor of the Axis powers.
As sugar rations were also put in place, treats were replaced with games or snacks that were more readily available, like popcorn or peanuts.
Later, after the end of the war and Halloween restrictions ended, the holiday became far more focused on kids.
This has led to popular events, like battalion-wide Halloween events or trunk-or-treats, where people bring their cars to a location, decorate them with a theme, and hand out candy.","Today, Halloween is one of the biggest sugar-filled days of the year, filled with costumes and treats. But to get that candy in the first place, there’s something kids must say first: “Trick or Treat.” And it’s only in recent decades that we’ve leaned in to treats. Prior to that, it was all about the tricks.

Before knocking on doors became commonplace, seemingly giving folks the option to opt out of their trick, pranks or other destructive behavior was simply part of Halloween. According to Nicholas Rodgers, author of “Halloween: From Pagan Ritual to Party Night,” this practice began as early as 1911, with traditions from other countries blending into American culture. By the mid-30s, kids in costumes saying “treats or tricks” had become popular.

However, older kids would take to their own pastimes. Notably, teenage boys would go out into the night to wreak havoc in their neighborhoods. Gates were left open, fences broken or torn down, tires were deflated, and doorbells rang at all hours.

World War II put that all to an end. In 1942, a California newspaper published a cartoon implying Halloween pranks were in favor of the Axis powers. The picture includes a teenage boy who receives a message from Emperor Hirohito, Adolph Hitler, and Benito Mussolini, “Do something destructive this Halloween… you’ll be helping us.”

Suddenly, the idea of pranks had become anti-American. Additional text explained that pranks would be considered unlawful and would come with corresponding consequences. Further stories were published about pranks performed by sleeping spies, the pranks serving as signs. Others told stories of raid bells causing chaos, all of which was blamed on Halloween. Not only did teenagers have cause to pause, but their parents suddenly had motivation to make sure they behaved, especially on a night meant for mischief.

In addition, towns were observing “dim out” rules to conserve power, meaning it was less likely for kids to go door-to-door after dark. Effectively, this kept most everyone at home for Halloween of 1942, a sentiment that carried into the following year. For some towns, this meant canceled parties and celebrations, even in the daylight. Others created events that were pro-American, like bringing in scrap metal.

In many ways, modern children’s parties can be traced to these early predecessors, who wanted them held in the daylight and to prove that nothing nefarious was taking place.

As sugar rations were also put in place, treats were replaced with games or snacks that were more readily available, like popcorn or peanuts. Later, after the end of the war and Halloween restrictions ended, the holiday became far more focused on kids. This is likely due to those who remembered missing out on their own trick-or-treating days.

In the early 1950s, Disney re-popularized the idea of asking for treats with cartoons like Donald Duck showing how to trick-or-treat. Peanuts did the same, revamping the idea of going door-to-door.

In more modern wars, the U.S. has changed its security measures locally, perhaps altering who can access a military base and what they can do there. This has led to popular events, like battalion-wide Halloween events or trunk-or-treats, where people bring their cars to a location, decorate them with a theme, and hand out candy. This creates a more secure environment while still allowing fun—and sugar—for all involved.

Unless you have been unaware, we have a government shutdown. Although all benefits to veterans have not been held up there are some problems regarding our armed forces that are still serving.

The Veterans of Foreign Wars joined Iraq and Afghanistan Veterans of America, along with fellow organizations that serve the military and veteran communities, at a press conference calling on Congress to end the government shutdown and pass H.R.5401, Pay Our Troops Act of 2026.

VFW National Legislative Associate Director Joy Craig reminded lawmakers, “This shutdown is not just a debate in Washington, it’s a kitchen-table crisis for military and veteran families across the country.”

She cautioned that while current paychecks are being covered through temporary funding shifts, future pay is not guaranteed. Craig added, “No one who has sworn an oath to this nation should have to wonder if their paycheck will come.”

Senate Advances Defense Bill Strengthening Transition & Quality of Life: The Senate united to pass its $925 billion National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2026, marking a bipartisan breakthrough despite the ongoing government shutdown.

The bill includes several provisions long championed by the VFW, including enhanced TRICARE benefits supporting women and family health, increased funding for the Defense POW/MIA Accounting Agency, and the creation of a senior DOD official to oversee military-to-civilian transition policy.

It also directs DOD to pilot a new housing allowance model to improve affordability and accuracy. Senate and House Armed Services Committee leaders will now negotiate a final version for passage before the end of the year.

The Defense POW/MIA Accounting Agency announced no identifications or burial updates this week. This week I would like to highlight the service of John Basiloni. Giovanni (John) was born to a large and loud Italian-American family with roots in Buffalo, New York, and Raritan, New Jersey.

The ten children in this Catholic family would not have been unusual in the early 1900s. John was the sixth child born to Salvatore, who emigrated from Italy, and Theadora, who grew up in New Jersey.

Theadora's parents had also emigrated from Italy. In classic fashion, Sal and Theadora met at a church gathering and they married three years later. John was born on November 4, 1916, at home in Buffalo.

After John Basilone turned 18 years old, he enlisted, in July 1934. As an infantry grunt, Basilone completed basic training and after stateside training, his first overseas assignment was to the Philippines.

Basilone’s tour in the islands would have been exotic for a New Jersey boy with little risk of engagement. He enjoyed the food, temperature, women, and comradery of his Army buddies.

When he left the Army and returned stateside, he often thought about how to get back to Manila. He drove a truck for three years in Raritan, but the tropical breezes of Manila were always on his mind.

The coldest month on average in Manila was 78 degrees and with no snow. John had to feel it was much better than Buffalo, New York, or New Jersey. Good duty if you can get it. John thought about getting back to that good duty and felt his best opportunity to get back to Manila was with the Marines.

He did this initial training like all Marines, although he was older and more experienced based on the Army stint. He was sent to Guantanamo, Cuba, as his first overseas assignment with the Marines. The next assignment would not be as idyllic.

On August 7, 1942, America mounted its first major amphibious landing of World War II at Guadalcanal, using an innovative landing craft built by Higgins Industries in New Orleans.

The goal was to capture a strategic airfield site on the island (later named Henderson Field for a US pilot lost in the Battle of Midway). This island was the farthest south the Rising Sun Empire had captured.

To halt Japanese efforts to disrupt supply routes to Australia and New Zealand victory was paramount but uncertain. The invasion ignited a ferocious struggle marked by seven major naval battles, numerous clashes ashore, and almost continuous air combat over eight months.

After ferrying Marines to Guadalcanal, the U.S. Coast Guardsmen (Coasties) under the command of the Navy, stayed on the island in August 1942. Coasties also served as signalmen from the shore to the ships. Douglas A. Munro set up blinkers to signal the ship at night until he returned to his ship.

As in a long battle, ammunition became critically low. Basilone fought through the hostile ground to resupply his heavy-machine gunners with urgently needed supplies.

Basilone moved an extra gun into position and maintained continual fire against the incoming Japanese forces. He then repaired and manned another machine gun, holding the defensive line until relief arrived.

When the last of the ammunition ran out shortly before dawn on the second day, Basilone, using his pistol and a machete, held off the Japanese soldiers attacking his position.

By the end of the engagement, Japanese forces opposite the Marines' lines had been virtually annihilated. In the Battle of Bloody Ridge, a few Marines - and most notably John Basilone - held the high ground above Henderson Field.

Following the decisive Naval Battle of Guadalcanal, the Japanese abandoned their attempts to retake Henderson Field, though fighting would continue for a few more months.

For his own critical role in the Battle of Bloody Ridge, Sergeant John Basilone was awarded the Medal of Honor. He was sent stateside and performed hundreds of war bond tours and rallies

Manila John asked to go back to the war front, but the Marine Corps denied his request and told him he needed more on the home front. He was offered an officer commission, which he turned down, and was later offered an assignment as an instructor, but refused this as well.

Finally, his request to return to the fighting was approved. This time he did additional training on the west coast at Camp Pendleton. While at Pendleton, Basilone met and married Lena Mae Riggi, a sergeant in the Marine Women's Reserve serving as a field cook. They married in July 1944.

Returning to the fleet, Basilone was assigned to ""C"" Company, 1st Battalion, 27th Marine Regiment, 5th Marine Division. On February 19, 1945, the first day of the invasion of Iwo Jima, he was serving as a machine gun section leader.

While the landing at Guadalcanal was uneventful and even surprised the Japanese, that was not the case on Iwo Jima. While the Marines landed, the Japanese concentrated their fire on the incoming Marines from heavily fortified blockhouses staged throughout the island.

Units were pinned down everywhere. Basilone flanked the side of the Japanese positions until he was directly on top of the blockhouse. He then attacked with grenades and demolitions, single-handedly destroying the entire strong point and its defending garrison.

He then fought his way toward Airfield Number 1 and aided a Marine tank that was trapped in an enemy minefield under intense mortar and artillery barrages. He guided the heavy vehicle over the hazardous terrain to safety, despite heavy weapons fire from the Japanese.

As he moved along the edge of the airfield, he was killed by Japanese mortar shrapnel or small arms fire. Basilone was posthumously awarded the Marine Corps' second-highest decoration for valor, the Navy Cross, for extraordinary heroism during the Battle of Iwo Jim.

John's wife, Lena, originally from Oregon, remained in California after John's death and never remarried. John Basilone died while doing his duty to his utmost.

On his left arm was a tattoo that read ""Death before Dishonor."" John lived by that motto. To this day, ""Manila John"" Basilone is one of Marine's unbelievable stories of heroism.

All who served our nation, served with honor and dedication. Let us remember all who gave the ultimate sacrifice for our country. God bless them all. Remember all those serving our country today and keep them in your thoughts and prayers. God Bless America.

Which TRICARE Plans Include Mental Health Coverage for TMS Therapy?
All major TRICARE plans cover TMS therapy as part of their mental health benefits.
TRICARE covers TMS therapy for active-duty members and military retirees who meet specific eligibility requirements.
Military retirees with TRICARE eligibility, whether through TRICARE Prime, TRICARE Select, or TRICARE For Life, also have access to this coverage under the same clinical criteria.","When trying to determine insurance coverage for mental health treatment in the military, many people wonder, does TRICARE cover TMS Therapy. The answer is yes, Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (TMS) is a covered benefit under TRICARE for eligible beneficiaries who meet specific clinical criteria.

TRICARE began covering TMS as part of its basic benefit package in 2016, recognizing it as an effective treatment option for patients with treatment-resistant Major Depressive Disorder. This coverage applies to active duty service members, military retirees, eligible family members, including spouses and children, and National Guard and Reserve members.

Because TMS is considered a limited benefit under TRICARE, prior authorization is required before beginning treatment using military insurance. While TRICARE covers TMS for Major Depressive Disorder, it does not currently cover the therapy for other conditions, such as PTSD, anxiety disorders, or concussion symptoms when these occur independently. However, coverage may apply when these conditions are present alongside MDD.

Who Qualifies for TRICARE-Covered TMS Therapy?

To qualify for TRICARE coverage of TMS therapy, veterans and active duty military insurance policyholders must meet all of the following criteria:

Medical Requirements:

Be diagnosed with Major Depressive Disorder by a psychiatrist

Have attempted at least four different antidepressant medications that did not work

Be 18 years of age or older

Eligible Beneficiaries:

TRICARE coverage extends to:

Active duty service members – all branches of the military

Military retirees – those who have completed their service and retired from the military

Family members – spouses and children of active duty or retired service members

National Guard and Reserve members – and their eligible family members

Administrative Requirement:

Prior authorization is required before beginning TMS treatment, as it is considered a limited benefit under TRICARE.

Which TRICARE Plans Include Mental Health Coverage for TMS Therapy?

All major TRICARE plans cover TMS therapy as part of their mental health benefits. Here’s the breakdown by plan:

TRICARE Plans That Cover TMS:

TRICARE Prime

A managed-care option where Military Treatment Facilities are the principal source of health care

Requires a referral from your Primary Care Manager for specialty mental health services

Typically has the lowest out-of-pocket costs

TRICARE Select

A fee-for-service option that offers more flexibility in choosing providers

Does not require a referral to see specialists, including for TMS therapy

Higher copayments compared to TRICARE Prime

TRICARE For Life

Provides supplementary health-care coverage for TRICARE beneficiaries 65 years old and older who are entitled to Medicare Part A and enrolled in Medicare Part B

Offers coverage for mental health services, including TMS therapy

TRICARE Reserve Select

Available to certain members of the National Guard and Reserve

Includes mental health coverage for TMS therapy

The cost patients pay depends on the TRICARE plan, whether their sponsor enlisted before or after January 1, 2018, and their status as active duty, retired, or family member. All TRICARE insurance plans for mental health include a variety of treatment options, such as inpatient care, outpatient therapy, prescription medications, and both group and family therapy, with TMS being part of the outpatient mental health benefit.

Is TMS Covered by TRICARE for Veterans and Active-Duty Members?

TRICARE covers TMS therapy for active-duty members and military retirees who meet specific eligibility requirements. Active-duty members across all branches of the military can access TMS therapy as an outpatient treatment for Major Depressive Disorder when a psychiatrist has diagnosed them and has demonstrated treatment resistance by trying at least four different antidepressant medications without success.

Military retirees with TRICARE eligibility, whether through TRICARE Prime, TRICARE Select, or TRICARE For Life, also have access to this coverage under the same clinical criteria. The treatment is available as part of TRICARE’s mental health benefits package.

TRICARE coverage applies specifically to military retirees and active-duty personnel, not all veterans. Veterans who separated from military service without retiring typically receive their healthcare through the Department of Veterans Affairs system rather than TRICARE. VA coverage policies for TMS may differ from TRICARE’s guidelines.

How Does TMS Compare to Other TRICARE Mental Health Treatments?

TMS therapy stands apart from other TRICARE-covered mental health treatments in several significant ways. Unlike traditional antidepressant medications, TMS is a non-invasive, drug-free therapy that uses magnetic fields to stimulate specific nerve cells in the brain associated with mood regulation. This makes it particularly valuable for military members and their families who may wish to avoid medication side effects or reduce their dependence on pharmaceuticals.

TMS requires no anesthesia and does not necessitate hospitalization, with treatment sessions typically lasting only 20-30 minutes and allowing patients to resume normal activities immediately afterward. While conventional psychotherapy and medications remain the first-line treatments covered by TRICARE for depression, TMS is specifically reserved for patients with treatment-resistant Major Depressive Disorder.

The positioning of TMS within TRICARE’s mental health treatment hierarchy reflects its role as an advanced intervention for complex cases. TRICARE covers a comprehensive range of mental health services, including individual and group therapy, psychiatric consultations, inpatient hospitalization, and various medications as standard treatments. However, TMS is designated as a limited benefit requiring prior authorization, signaling that it is a specialized option after traditional approaches have proven insufficient.",https://momentofclarity.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/does-tricare-cover-tms-therapy.jpg,N,0.0,2025-10-24 18:00:02.623275

Forty-one states, including DC, have adopted Medicaid expansion, and nearly seven in ten veterans ages 19 and older who have Medicaid coverage live in a state that has expanded Medicaid.

Without Medicaid, veterans and their families may find that mental health, substance abuse, preventive care, chronic disease management and in-home services are simply unaffordable or unavailable.

Medicaid cuts

The cuts roll out slowly, cutting federal funding for Medicaid by 15 percent, or $1 trillion, over 10 years. The Congressional Budget Office estimates that these cuts will ultimately result in:

11.8 million individuals directly losing their health insurance coverage under Medicaid;

an additional 3.1 million losing Medicaid coverage under ACA marketplace plans;

another 4.2 million covered under marketplace plans would become uninsured with the expiration later in 2025 of the expanded premium tax credits for purchasing the plans. The plans will simply become unaffordable.

According to the American Psychological Association (APA), the fallout from this last requirement represents the largest component of the cuts, totaling $325.8 billion over 10 years.

Five basic facts about the impact of the cuts – what the numbers say

Medicaid provides health care coverage to 1 in 10 veterans (1.6 million people). For some, it is their only source of coverage, especially if they do not qualify for VA health care or TRICARE. A recent study by KFF provides statistical support for five important, and perhaps underappreciated, facts about veterans and Medicaid:

First, the percentage of veterans who depend on Medicaid, either in whole or in part, has increased over the past decade. As the veteran population changes, so too have the pathways to coverage. The Affordable Care Act created a new avenue for veterans who might otherwise have been uninsured. It expands Medicaid eligibility to nearly all adults with incomes up to 138 percent of the Federal Poverty Level ($21,597 for an individual in 2025). Forty-one states, including DC, have adopted Medicaid expansion, and nearly seven in ten veterans ages 19 and older who have Medicaid coverage live in a state that has expanded Medicaid.

Second, Medicaid often supplements coverage for older vets. Many of today’s veterans served during the Vietnam and Gulf Wars. Medicaid often supplements other types of insurance by covering services that other payers may not, such as long-term care. For veterans who are enrolled in Medicare and Medicaid, Medicaid can help cover premiums and cost- sharing responsibilities, reducing out-of-pocket costs for services like doctor visits, hospital stays, and prescription drugs.

Third, veterans with disabilities are more likely to rely on Medicaid than those who do not have disabilities. Age and disability often go hand-in hand. For vets from 50 to 64, slightly more than half of Medicaid enrollees report having a disability. Veterans 65 and older who have Medicaid coverage report a disability rate of 55 percent.

Fourth, Medicaid supports regular access to care for veterans who have high rates of chronic conditions and complex health needs.

In insurance-speak, “chronic conditions” means long-lasting illnesses or injuries like arthritis, diabetes or certain respiratory diseases. In the same strange legal language, “complex health needs” might mean PTSD, traumatic brain injuries, and chronic pain, as well as respiratory conditions, cancers, and other illnesses linked to burn pits, Agent Orange, and other hazards.

All veterans have high rates of chronic conditions and many, including older vets, have complex and layered health needs. Among veterans covered by Medicaid, 41 percent received mental health or substance use treatment in the past year.

Finally, nearly seven in ten veterans under 65 with Medicaid are working, but work varies by age, disability, and parental status:

the share of veterans who are working declines with age, falling to 59 percent of those ages 50 to 64. The share of veterans with a disability drops to 51 percent.

parents are more likely to be in the workforce than veterans without dependent children, which likely reflects their younger age and lower rates of disability.

Beginning in January 2027, most Medicaid recipients will need to meet work requirements of 80 hours per month through employment, training, or volunteer activities to maintain their coverage. According to the APA, the fallout from this requirement represents the largest component of the cuts, totaling $325.8 billion over ten years.

What’s next?

Because the cuts roll out slowly, Congress may still intervene to lessen the blow to veterans. But, at present, the situation does not look rosy for elderly and disabled veterans, who are among the most vulnerable.

The student, between 16 and 17 years old, confided in a professor, providing detailed testimony and recordings that substantiated the claims.

Swift Action Taken Following Report of Sexual Assault

On October 14, the Walton County Sheriff’s Office said campus police alerted deputies after receiving the professor’s report. Investigators identified 45-year-old Charles Marcello Buono as the suspect and located him at his home.

Confession and Arrest of FL Bus Driver

Initially, Buono denied any wrongdoing, but officials stated he later admitted to being the man in one of the videos submitted as evidence and confirmed the nature of the acts described. He was arrested without incident and booked into the Walton County Jail on charges of lewd and lascivious molestation by an offender 24 years or older on a victim aged 16 or 17.

Sheriff Condemns the Crime

Sheriff Michael Adkinson described the case as deeply disturbing, stating, “What happened here is nothing short of evil. Crimes like this shake our sense of humanity, and we will not rest until justice is served.”

Bus Driver Suspended and Investigation Expands

Buono, a bus driver for the Walton County School District, was immediately suspended following his arrest. District officials confirmed he would be recommended for termination at the next board meeting. He was also employed as a contractor with the Defense Health Agency.

The sheriff’s office clarified that the charges do not stem from Buono’s job as a driver and do not involve students on his bus route. However, investigators said they are reviewing all available information and have not ruled out additional victims.

Victim Praised for Courage

Authorities commended the young victim for her bravery and expressed gratitude to the college staff for responding swiftly and responsibly. To protect the victim’s identity, specific details about the case remain confidential.

Ongoing Investigation After Teen Sexually Abused by Bus Driver

Officials confirmed that the investigation is still active, and additional charges could follow as evidence continues to develop.

Legal Pathways for Families After Bus Driver Abuse Cases

When accusations of abuse involve a trusted school employee, families often face confusion about where to turn next. In this interview, Florida abuse lawyer Michael Haggard discusses the rights of victims and their families, how civil action can run alongside criminal proceedings, and what steps can be taken to hold responsible parties accountable.

Laurence Banville, Esq.: When a situation like this involves a school district employee, what legal steps can families take?

Michael Haggard, Esq.: Families can pursue a civil claim not only against the individual offender but potentially against the school district if there’s evidence of negligence—such as inadequate background checks, poor supervision, or failure to respond to warning signs. These cases aren’t only about compensation but also accountability and change.

Banville: How soon should families reach out for legal help?

Haggard: Immediately. Preserving evidence and witness statements is time-sensitive. An attorney can guide the family on reporting requirements and help ensure their rights are protected throughout the process.

Banville: What would you say to families struggling to decide whether to take action?

Haggard: No one should face this alone. Seeking legal representation helps ensure the system holds those responsible to account and that victims receive support for recovery. Legal action can also drive improvements in safety within schools and transportation programs.

Military beneficiaries in Atlanta can now choose CareSource for help, health",Ellen Eldridge,,,,,https://www.gpb.org/news/2025/10/24/for-us-and-by-us-military-beneficiaries-in-atlanta-can-now-choose-caresource-for,"But, until now, he had no choice about who managed his health care plan.
Eligible beneficiaries of Tricare Prime include active duty, military retirees and their families, families of activated National Guard Reservists and Gold Star families.
During open enrollment from Nov. 10 to Dec. 9, eligible beneficiaries who choose Tricare Prime will now see CareSource as another organization that will manage their health plans.
""So, they have a choice (concerning who manages their health plan),"" Martin said.
Martin compared the health plan to buying an automobile that puts military families in the driver's seat.","Jarrad Turner chose to serve his country as an Army medic, even after serious injuries. But, until now, he had no choice about who managed his health care plan. That forced him to obtain referrals for specialists and change providers when he didn't want to.

A year into his second deployment in support of Operation Iraqi Freedom in 2006, Turner was nearly killed by a rocket-propelled grenade.

""As a result of getting injured, I had to have four shoulder surgeries, two elbow surgeries, two surgeries on my jaw, and I got filleted with a piece of shrapnel,"" Turner said.

The Army treated his physical wounds, but Turner didn't realize the toll his mental health took until he was stationed at Fort Sam in Houston, Texas, as a trainer for medics.

""Unfortunately, that's when traumatic brain injury kind of reared its ugly head,"" and post-traumatic stress disorder took over, he said.

While driving during a thunderstorm, a fallen tree branch in the road stopped Turner's truck.

""I knew it was a branch,"" he said. ""I literally had to get out of my truck and literally touch the branch because I had so much fear that it was going to blow up because I was so accustomed to IEDs and daisy-chained improvised bombs.""

RELATED: This PTSD treatment uses eye movement to turn traumatic memories into learning, healing experiences

Turner moved to Atlanta when medically retired in 2010 and started Tricare, the military health insurance program.

""People don't answer the phone call,"" he said. ""You might get somebody to respond in a week. And unfortunately, people did not understand who I was or understand what the rest of my brothers and sisters had gone through.""

Eligible beneficiaries of Tricare Prime include active duty, military retirees and their families, families of activated National Guard Reservists and Gold Star families.

Tricare Prime service areas were built around Base Realignment and Closure (BRAC) sites.

""We lost Fort McPherson, we lost Fort Gillum, but we have so many military retirees here,"" Turner said.

The health plan is managed by the Defense Health Agency and the Department of Defense, but CareSource Miliary & Veterans’ managed care model is intended to increase access to care, while providing personalized support and engagement, to improve health outcomes and quality of life, Care Source Military and Veterans Associate Vice President Selene Martin, said.

During open enrollment from Nov. 10 to Dec. 9, eligible beneficiaries who choose Tricare Prime will now see CareSource as another organization that will manage their health plans.

""So, they have a choice (concerning who manages their health plan),"" Martin said. ""Atlanta-area beneficiaries have only had a choice one other time in the past five years.""

Martin compared the health plan to buying an automobile that puts military families in the driver's seat.

Tricare Prime is the base of the model of car, she said.

""So, with the pilot, you get the base models, but the enhanced benefits that you get include no network referrals,"" Martin said. ""We know that is a barrier and pain point for our military families.""

Anyone who chooses to see a specialist within the network can go see them, which Turner is excited about because he does not want to lose the mental health providers that he counts on.

""There is anxiety about starting all over again,"" he said. ""How many times do we have to tell the story? I don't want to go to another mental health provider, a physical health provider to retell the story.""

""Finally, we got something that is for us and by us,"" Turner said, adding that the CareSource team reflects what the military community is.

""It's a very diverse team of passionate individuals that live by, clearly live by, our ethos.""",https://www.gpb.org/sites/default/files/styles/three_two_702x468/public/2025-10/jarrad_turner_veteran_caresource.jpg?h=9c4c0580&itok=Kb8av7nk,N,0.0,2025-10-24 11:20:28.460623

“TRICARE Open Season is the time to review your coverage and choose the plan that best fits your family’s needs,” said Zelly Zim, senior program analyst, TRICARE Health Plan Policy & Programs, at the Defense Health Agency. “Even if you don’t plan to make a change, it’s good to check your information and confirm your plan still works for you.”

In Virginia Beach this month, a group of veterans, lawmakers, and advocates gathered around one shared concern: how a wave of federal cuts from Republicans’ “One Big Beautiful Bill Act” and a continuing government shutdown could strip away service members’ hard-earned health care and autonomy.

At the event hosted by the Virginia House Democratic Caucus, Delegates Michael Feggans (D-Virginia Beach County), Dan Helmer (D-Fairfax), and Jackie Glass (D-Norfolk), all military veterans themselves, met with Norfolk councilman and Air Force veteran JP Paige to discuss what they called mounting threats to veterans’ health care access. They were joined by Retired Master Chief Petty Officer Susan Hippen, Sentra Health Senior Director of Government & Community Relations Andy Stephenson, and Jamie Lockhart, executive director of Planned Parenthood Advocates of Virginia.

While the roundtable touched on issues ranging from TRICARE costs and mental health support to delayed appointments at the VA, the discussion repeatedly returned to one topic: : reproductive rights and how new federal policies could hinder basic care for women who have served.

Federal fallout

Feggans, a retired Air Force health care administrator, said the federal government shutdown and the passage of Trump’s “One Big Beautiful Bill” are not only halting paychecks for federal workers, but also cutting into veterans’ health care and livelihoods.

“We’re seeing a federal government who is purposely, in many ways, trying to pull funding from many organizations that provide funding for women veterans and [other] veterans,” Feggans said.

“As someone who is currently in the VA system right now, I can tell you the doctors, nurses, technicians, and administrators, they’re doing the very best that they can. Unfortunately though, they’re currently working in a system…that their experiences and capabilities are being curtailed by a federal government and sometimes by a state government that doesn’t support them that way.”

Feggans also called the Trump presidency “the most anti-veteran administration in recent memory,” arguing that decisions in Washington are reshaping how veterans receive care in every part of the system, from the VA to local clinics.

On Oct. 1, the federal government officially entered a partial shutdown after Congress failed to pass a new spending bill. The resulting lapse in funding has paused paychecks for thousands of employees and federal contractors, delayed cemetery services and health benefits, and disrupted agency partnerships that supply veterans with support during transitional periods, career outreach, medical equipment, and prescription deliveries.

But beyond paychecks and paperwork, Feggans said, the steepest consequences are showing up in reproductive health.

Planned Parenthood’s role in veteran care

Planned Parenthood of Virginia operates three centers in Chesapeake, Virginia Beach, and Hampton—though the Hampton location is listed as “temporarily closed” on Google. Lockhart said veterans often turn to their clinics when VA appointments take months or when they want to keep reproductive care private.

Trump’s “One Big Beautiful Bill” included a federal provision barring Medicaid reimbursements to Planned Parenthood. As a result, clinics that once received government reimbursement for preventive services like birth control, STI testing, and cancer screenings can no longer bill Medicaid for that care. Instead, patients must pay out-of-pocket or forgo treatments altogether.

Lockhart said Planned Parenthood was the only organization singled out for defunding efforts and that the removal of Medicaid reimbursements for Planned Parenthood under the bill is already affecting veterans who rely on its clinics for non-abortion care.

READ MORE: At a Virginia roundtable, advocates warn contraception rights are at risk

She also warned of a proposed VA rule that would prohibit VA clinicians from counseling or referring veteran patients for abortion—even in cases of rape, incest, or when the patient’s life is at risk.

“I think it goes without saying that those who fight for our freedom deserve the ability to have the freedom over their own health care decisions,” Lockhart said. “We’re at a really tough time in the compounding of factors.”

The consequences of such a rule reach beyond the VA, a point Del. Helmer drove home.

“When you raise your right hand and join the military, you expect to have the same rights across the United States of America,” he said. “You are going to protect your country, and in return, your country is going to protect you.”

He said that promise is now broken for some.

“Today, a young woman who raises her right hand and swears an oath to defend the Constitution, can be sent all over the country to state in which is she is a victim of rape or some other assault,” Helmer continued. “She is unable to get access to health care.”

Virginia’s unique role

Virginia is home to the largest concentration of women veterans in the country, comprising nearly 16% of the state’s veteran population according to the Virginia Department of Veterans Services’ 2022 Annual Report. This reflects the state’s dense network of military installations across Hampton Roads, Northern Virginia, and Richmond.

That distinction, lawmakers said, makes the Commonwealth’s health policies even more consequential. With more women veterans than anywhere else, Virginia’s reproductive health care laws can influence the experiences of thousands of veterans stationed here.

“There are a lot of individuals who might not even realize that a lot of women veterans receive care at your organization,” Feggans said to Lockhart. “…As we’re seeing a federal government who is purposely, in many ways, trying to pull funding from organizations that provide care for women veterans.”

‘We could not count on the VA’

Del. Jackie Glass, a retired Navy cryptologic technician, said Planned Parenthood filled critical gaps for her and her peers when the VA could not.

“When I was stationed in San Diego, Planned Parenthood was the place for us,” she said. “We could not count on the VA. I didn’t even think of Planned Parenthood as a place where you got an abortion.”

She said that loss of access affects not just individuals but entire units.

“When I think about family planning, when you choose to do that in the military, it is not just about that woman service nowhere, it is about that unit,” Glass said. “And so a loss of Planned Parenthood, it doesn’t just affect the woman service partner, it can affect her partner and the decision that they’re able to make in their career, long term.”

Retired Master Chief Susan Hippen agreed to Glass’ point.

“If I had not had autonomy over my life,” she said, “I don’t know that I could have had career success.”

Beyond reproductive care

While reproductive rights dominated the conversation, speakers at the roundtable said federal decisions threatening abortion and birth control access are simultaneously straining every other corner of veterans’ care, from mental health services to housing supports and rising TRICARE costs.

For many on the panel, the connection was clear: When veterans can’t make decisions about their own health, it ripples into every other part of their lives. Loss of autonomy, they said, leads to lost stability: financial, emotional, and physical.

With a Democratic majority of only one seat in the Virginia House of Delegates and the election looming, Helmer warned that the state’s status as a “safe haven” for reproductive care could quickly be erased.

“On Nov. 5, we could find ourselves in the Commonwealth [with] active duty service members [who] don’t have access to the care they have earned,” he said. “In which they don’t have the rights simply because they are stationed in Virginia. I think that’s unacceptable.”",https://vadogwood.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2025/10/virginia-veterans-warn-trump-s-reproductive-health-cuts-are-taking-freedoms-they-fought-for.jpg,N,0.0,2025-10-23 16:20:51.830405

Video of Exchange (YouTube)

Washington, D.C. — At a hearing of the Senate Special Committee on Aging, Senator Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) asked Mark Cuban, founder of Cost Plus Drugs, and Dr. Jeanne Lambrew, Director of Health Care Reform and Senior Fellow at The Century Foundation, about the potential for greater transparency in the pharmaceutical industry to lower costs for taxpayers and military families.

Express Scripts negotiates contract terms, including reimbursement rates, with pharmacies in the TRICARE network, which is the health care system for the military, retirees, and their families. However, Express Scripts also owns pharmacies that participate in the TRICARE network, creating a conflict of interest that allows Express Scripts to under-reimburse unaffiliated pharmacies and give inflated payments to its own subsidiaries.

Despite this conflict, the Defense Health Agency does not require Express Scripts to report the difference in reimbursement rates between affiliated and unaffiliated pharmacies.

“It would save a lot of money, and it would keep smaller independent pharmacies in business,” Mr. Cuban said about publishing this information.

However, the Congressional Budget Office (CBO) claims doing so would raise TRICARE costs, because unaffiliated pharmacies would allegedly respond by demanding higher reimbursements from TRICARE.

As a result of changes Express Scripts made to the TRICARE pharmacy network, 13,000 pharmacies – the overwhelming majority of which were independent pharmacies – were forced to leave the TRICARE network. The Defense Health Agency (DHA) maintains that military families’ pharmacy access has not been affected by these changes – but this is based on data submitted to the agency by Express Scripts, which the Government Accountability Office (GAO) reported contained multiple inconsistencies. GAO recommended that DHA periodically audit the Express Scripts data for accuracy.

When asked if regularly auditing the Express Scripts data for accuracy, as GAO recommends, would help save taxpayers money, Dr. Jeanne Lambrew replied that it would.

“I hope to work with all of my colleagues to pass proposals to rein in self-dealing by the PBMs in TRICARE and beyond…we need to stop these giant corporations from ripping off American taxpayers and get a little more competition in the drug market,” Senator Warren concluded.

Senator Warren filed amendments to the FY 2026 National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA) to require greater transparency and auditing of the TRICARE pharmacy contract. The amendments were ruled out of order after CBO determined the amendments would raise TRICARE costs. Senator Warren also has a bipartisan bill with Senator Josh Hawley (R-Mo.) that would prohibit joint ownership of pharmacy benefit managers and pharmacies.

Transcript: Hearing on Modernizing Health Care: How Shoppable Services Improve Outcomes and Lower Costs

U.S. Senate Special Committee on Aging

October 22, 2025

Senator Elizabeth Warren: So, military families keep us safe, and DoD’s TRICARE program is supposed to keep those military families healthy. Since 2009, TRICARE pharmacy benefit has been administered by Express Scripts, the nation’s largest pharmacy benefit manager, or PBM. Express Scripts decides which pharmacies are in-network or out, so when one of those 9 million military families needs to pick up a prescription, Express Scripts decides where they can go to have it filled and then they pay the pharmacy.

Now, Express Scripts is owned by the multi-billion health insurance company Cigna, and Cigna also owns a mail order pharmacy called Accredo that participates in TRICARE. In other words, Cigna owns the company that pays pharmacies and it also owns the pharmacy chain that is getting paid. The result? Well, Express Scripts can under-reimburse other pharmacies and give inflated payments to its corporate cousin, Accredo.

Express Scripts has been caught doing exactly that kind of self-dealing in other government programs, but right now, the DoD refuses to check how much it’s costing taxpayers in TRICARE.

Mr. Cuban, you understand this business, so let me ask you. Would requiring Express Scripts to disclose the difference between what it pays its affiliated and the unaffiliated pharmacies help save taxpayers money or cost taxpayers money?

Mark Cuban, Founder of Cost Plus Drugs: It would save a lot of money, and it would keep smaller independent pharmacies in business.

Senator Warren: Okay, you know, that makes sense to me. It seems pretty common sense here: more transparency would save taxpayer money. But the Congressional Budget Office disagrees with you and me on this. According to CBO, price transparency would cost taxpayers money because other pharmacies would allegedly band together to demand higher reimbursements, that’s their argument here.

Mr. Cuban, you talk with pharmacists a lot. Do you think that independent pharmacists don’t know that Accredo, right now, is getting a sweetheart deal and that the independents are just waiting for information to be told so they can demand more money?

Mr. Cuban: I can't speak for all the independents, but I can speak for costplusdrugs.com, and so, I went to TRICARE, and I have done this in the past many times, and looked up the price of some common, low-cost drugs. So I, you know, just recently, I looked up Tadalafil, right? And our price is lower, whether it's 30 or 90 pills, than the TRICARE price is for anybody who is in-network, but off-base, and if they're out-of-network, we're dramatically lower. So we don't need to band together to know that we can be cheaper. All we have to do is look at some of their prices, and it's obvious that we're cheaper.

Senator Warren: Okay, so this information is actually already out there?

Mr. Cuban: Yeah, I mean, it's just by looking at, and I'm just talking about the co-pays.

Senator Warren: Yeah.

Mr. Cuban: We're not even talking about what Express, what the taxpayers still have to pay to Express Scripts, Accredo, right? Which is more, they're not doing this for nothing. And so, I mean, taxpayers are getting ripped off, period. End of story.

Senator Warren: Okay, and this is where I want to see more transparency—

Mr. Cuban: Correct.

Senator Warren: You think that's a good thing?

Mr. Cuban: That's a great thing.

Senator Warren: Okay, that's a great thing. Good. I'll settle for that answer. All right, so, DoD claims that this hasn't affected military families, but that is based on data from—

Senator Rick Scott: They said it hasn’t?

Senator Warren: Has not. This has not affected military families based on data from, you guessed it, Express Scripts.

Mr. Cuban: [Laughs]

Senator Warren: So when the Government Accountability Office reviewed just a little slice of this data, they discovered, quote, “persistent inaccuracies,” including misreporting the number of people who lost access to their local pharmacies because the pharmacies were pushed out of the TRICARE network. They left, for the very reasons you described, but that was just a one time review, so I'm pushing DoD to audit this information every single year. Dr. Lambrew, you served as Commissioner of the Maine Department of Health and Human Services, so you understand the importance of program integrity. Do you think that auditing this program would help save taxpayers money or cost taxpayers money?

Dr. Jeanne Lambrew, Director of Health Care Reform and Senior Fellow at The Century Foundation: Senator, it would save money.

Senator Warren: It would save money. So, you know, I just want to point out here, Mr. Chairman, self-dealing by the pharmacy benefit managers keeps the cost of prescription drugs high, both for the taxpayers and for consumers. I'm going to keep pressing CBO to update their analysis of the PBMs, and I hope to work with all of my colleagues to pass proposals to rein in self-dealing by the PBMs in TRICARE and beyond, including my bill with Senator Hawley that would make the same company, say the same company, cannot own a PBM and an insurance company—and a pharmacy, at the same time. Look, we need to stop these giant corporations from ripping off American taxpayers and get a little more competition in the drug market. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.

This program, formally called the TRICARE Prime Demonstration, allows eligible dependents to opt into coverage administered by CareSource Military & Veterans (CSMV), rather than the standard regional contractor.
CSMV may administer the plan, but it follows the same emergency care rules as the broader TRICARE Prime program.
Your Prime copays, along with cost-sharing, remain consistent whether you choose standard TRICARE Prime or join the demonstration.
The 2026 TRICARE changes aren’t seismic, but they are significant.","Like tectonic plates, TRICARE is shifting again. If you’re a military spouse or family member trying to keep track of what’s changing and what it means for your family’s actual care, it might feel like a 7.5 earthquake. Between coverage adjustments in 2025 and the launch of a new demonstration project in 2026, the headlines may not always clearly explain how these moves impact day-to-day access, costs, and peace of mind. However, this community has been addressing this issue for a long time.

So let’s break it down, in plain language, from the perspective of the people who will feel it most: the families.

What Changed in 2025

Related: 6 dumb things I thought I knew about the military before joining

Some changes already hit in 2025. TRICARE Young Adult coverage now ends at age 21 unless a dependent is a full-time student, in which case it stretches to age 23. Survivors of deceased service members gained additional benefits, including more time in Prime and extended access to transitional coverage.

TRICARE regions also shifted. If your address placed you under a new regional contractor, you may have noticed differences in customer service, networks, or claims processing. Those changes are structural, but the next round is about choice.

Beginning in January 2026, the Defense Health Agency is launching a pilot program in two metro areas: Tampa, Florida, and Atlanta, Georgia. This program, formally called the TRICARE Prime Demonstration, allows eligible dependents to opt into coverage administered by CareSource Military & Veterans (CSMV), rather than the standard regional contractor.

This doesn’t replace TRICARE Prime nationwide. It’s not even automatic for families in those regions. You must enroll in the demo to participate, and enrollment opens during TRICARE’s annual open season.

The goal is to test whether a different contractor can offer improved access and expanded support services while maintaining the same high levels of care, all while adhering to the Prime cost structure. But many families are understandably cautious when they hear the words “pilot” or “demonstration.”

Will they still be covered in the event of an emergency? Can they see their existing providers? Will it cost more?

Emergency Care Under the Demo: What Families Need to Know

This is where intricacy matters most. Some reporting has left families confused about how emergency care will work if they opt into the new demo. Let’s be specific:

If you think it’s an emergency, go to the nearest ER, military or civilian, immediately. No referral or pre-authorization is required.

That’s true under traditional TRICARE Prime; it remains true for CareSource enrollees in the demo as well. Even if the emergency department is out of network, you will be covered at the standard Prime cost-share, as long as the visit meets TRICARE’s definition of an emergency.

The process of filing claims or following up on bills remains the same. CSMV may administer the plan, but it follows the same emergency care rules as the broader TRICARE Prime program.

Why CareSource? Why now?

CareSource isn’t new to managed care by any means. It has a long history with Medicaid within veteran populations and is now being tested in military health. The 2026 demo presents an opportunity for the Defense Health Agency to assess alternative approaches to managing care while preserving existing benefits within its areas of operation.

For families, this could mean better support, more streamlined customer service, and access to providers who may not currently be part of TRICARE’s traditional network. But these are potential benefits, not promises; it’s up to each family to weigh whether opting in makes sense.

What Doesn’t Change

Your DEERS enrollment still governs eligibility. Your Prime copays, along with cost-sharing, remain consistent whether you choose standard TRICARE Prime or join the demonstration. Your right to emergency care doesn’t simply vanish either. Your ability to return to regular Prime? Not a problem if done during future open seasons; this remains in effect.

What to Watch For

If you live in Tampa or Atlanta and receive notice that you’re eligible for the demo, read it carefully. Compare what’s being offered against what you already use. If you have specialists you depend on, call them directly to see if they’re part of the demo network. There are no referrals for in-network specialists. If you join the CareSource Prime Demonstration, and your current specialist is out-of-network, CareSource has a team of specialists that will work with your specialist to bring them in-network.

Most importantly, CareSource will cover a beneficiary’s out-of-network fees to continue seeing the specialist over the first 90 days, ensuring the beneficiary has a seamless experience, while CSMV handles the lift in the background.

Now if you still have questions, press for answers from TRICARE, CareSource, or your local military treatment facility; they will be there for you.

Health care isn’t just about policies; it’s about trust. That’s especially true for families managing moves, deployments, plus everything in between. The 2026 TRICARE changes aren’t seismic, but they are significant. Knowing the facts and being prepared before making a choice is the best decision you can make for your care.

If you’re a military spouse or family member trying to keep track of what’s changing and what it means for your family’s actual care, it might feel like a 7.5 earthquake. Between coverage adjustments in 2025 and the launch of a new demonstration project in 2026, the headlines may not always clearly explain how these moves impact day-to-day access, costs, and peace of mind. However, this community has been addressing this issue for a long time.

So let’s break it down, in plain language, from the perspective of the people who will feel it most: the families.

What Changed in 2025

Related: 6 dumb things I thought I knew about the military before joining

Some changes already hit in 2025. TRICARE Young Adult coverage now ends at age 21 unless a dependent is a full-time student, in which case it stretches to age 23. Survivors of deceased service members gained additional benefits, including more time in Prime and extended access to transitional coverage.

TRICARE regions also shifted. If your address placed you under a new regional contractor, you may have noticed differences in customer service, networks, or claims processing. Those changes are structural, but the next round is about choice.

Coming in 2026: The TRICARE Prime Demonstration

Beginning in January 2026, the Defense Health Agency is launching a pilot program in two metro areas: Tampa, Florida, and Atlanta, Georgia. This program, formally called the TRICARE Prime Demonstration, allows eligible dependents to opt into coverage administered by CareSource Military & Veterans (CSMV), rather than the standard regional contractor.

This doesn’t replace TRICARE Prime nationwide. It’s not even automatic for families in those regions. You must enroll in the demo to participate, and enrollment opens during TRICARE’s annual open season.

The goal is to test whether a different contractor can offer improved access and expanded support services while maintaining the same high levels of care, all while adhering to the Prime cost structure. But many families are understandably cautious when they hear the words “pilot” or “demonstration.”

Will they still be covered in the event of an emergency? Can they see their existing providers? Will it cost more?

Emergency Care Under the Demo: What Families Need to Know

This is where intricacy matters most. Some reporting has left families confused about how emergency care will work if they opt into the new demo. Let’s be specific:

If you think it’s an emergency, go to the nearest ER, military or civilian, immediately. No referral or pre-authorization is required.

That’s true under traditional TRICARE Prime; it remains true for CareSource enrollees in the demo as well. Even if the emergency department is out of network, you will be covered at the standard Prime cost-share, as long as the visit meets TRICARE’s definition of an emergency.

The process of filing claims or following up on bills remains the same. CSMV may administer the plan, but it follows the same emergency care rules as the broader TRICARE Prime program.

Why CareSource? Why now?

CareSource isn’t new to managed care by any means. It has a long history with Medicaid within veteran populations and is now being tested in military health. The 2026 demo presents an opportunity for the Defense Health Agency to assess alternative approaches to managing care while preserving existing benefits within its areas of operation.

For families, this could mean better support, more streamlined customer service, and access to providers who may not currently be part of TRICARE’s traditional network. But these are potential benefits, not promises; it’s up to each family to weigh whether opting in makes sense.

What Doesn’t Change

Your DEERS enrollment still governs eligibility. Your Prime copays, along with cost-sharing, remain consistent whether you choose standard TRICARE Prime or join the demonstration. Your right to emergency care doesn’t simply vanish either. Your ability to return to regular Prime? Not a problem if done during future open seasons; this remains in effect.

What to Watch For

If you live in Tampa or Atlanta and receive notice that you’re eligible for the demo, read it carefully. Compare what’s being offered against what you already use. If you have specialists you depend on, call them directly to see if they’re part of the demo network. There are no referrals for in-network specialists. If you join the CareSource Prime Demonstration, and your current specialist is out-of-network, CareSource has a team of specialists that will work with your specialist to bring them in-network.

Most importantly, CareSource will cover a beneficiary’s out-of-network fees to continue seeing the specialist over the first 90 days, ensuring the beneficiary has a seamless experience, while CSMV handles the lift in the background.

Now if you still have questions, press for answers from TRICARE, CareSource, or your local military treatment facility; they will be there for you.

Health care isn’t just about policies; it’s about trust. That’s especially true for families managing moves, deployments, plus everything in between. The 2026 TRICARE changes aren’t seismic, but they are significant. Knowing the facts and being prepared before making a choice is the best decision you can make for your care.

Subscribe now and take control of your AI investment future!","We came across a bullish thesis on GRAIL, Inc. on Value investing subreddit by BombasticBillionaire. In this article, we will summarize the bulls’ thesis on GRAL. GRAIL, Inc.’s share was trading at $86.41 as of October 16th.

Grail (GRAL) is emerging as a leader in multi-cancer early detection (MCED) with its Galleri blood test, which leverages machine learning on DNA methylation patterns to detect signals from over 50 cancer types, including hard-to-screen cancers like pancreatic and ovarian. The company, originally acquired by Illumina for $8 billion in 2020, was spun off in June 2024 due to antitrust concerns, with Illumina retaining a 14.5% stake.

The spin-off began with approximately $930 million in cash, providing Grail roughly two years of operational runway. Galleri has already demonstrated promising results in the PATHFINDER study and is undergoing validation in two large-scale trials—the NHS-Galleri study with 140,000 participants and PATHFINDER II, which includes over 35,000 Medicare enrollees—expected to report key outcomes between 2025 and 2026.

Supporting its adoption, the VA’s REFLECTION study and TRICARE coverage for older, at-risk members reinforce the test’s clinical potential. If these trials confirm effectiveness and Medicare reimbursement follows, Galleri could achieve annual sales of $2–3 billion, representing a substantial upside relative to Grail’s current sub-$1 billion valuation.

While the opportunity is compelling, the stock remains a high-risk, binary biotech play contingent on clinical and regulatory validation. Investors are positioned for significant potential gains if Grail successfully transitions from promising trials to broad clinical adoption, with Medicare coverage serving as a pivotal catalyst to unlock value.

Previously we covered a bullish thesis on GRAIL, Inc. (GRAL) by mike-some in April 2025, which highlighted its leadership in multi-cancer early detection, promising trial results, and potential Medicare-driven $2.25 billion sales. The company’s stock price has appreciated approximately by 233% since our coverage. The thesis still stands as trials progress. BombasticBillionaire shares a similar thesis but emphasizes updated cash runway, larger trial sizes, and $2–3 billion potential sales.

GRAIL, Inc. is not on our list of the 30 Most Popular Stocks Among Hedge Funds. As per our database, 28 hedge fund portfolios held GRAL at the end of the second quarter which was 25 in the previous quarter. While we acknowledge the risk and potential of GRAL as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter time frame. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than GRAL and that has 10,000% upside potential, check out our report about this cheapest AI stock.

Disclosure: None.

When Jeff Bezos said that one breakthrough technology would shape Amazon’s destiny, even Wall Street’s biggest analysts were caught off guard.

Fast forward a year and Amazon’s new CEO Andy Jassy described generative AI as a “once-in-a-lifetime” technology that is already being used across Amazon to reinvent customer experiences.

At the 8th Future Investment Initiative conference, Elon Musk predicted that by 2040 there would be at least 10 billion humanoid robots, with each priced between $20,000 and $25,000.

Do the math. According to Musk, this technology could be worth $250 trillion by 2040.

Put another way, that’s roughly equal to:

175 Teslas

107 Amazons

140 Metas

84 Googles

65 Microsofts

And 55 Nvidias

And here’s the wild part — this $250 trillion wave isn’t tied to one company, but to an entire ecosystem of AI innovators set to reshape the global economy.

It’s a leap so massive, it could reshape how businesses, governments, and consumers operate worldwide.

Even if that $250 trillion figure sounds ambitious, major firms like PwC and McKinsey still see AI unlocking multi-trillion-dollar potential.

How could anything be worth that much?

The answer lies in a breakthrough so powerful it’s redefining how humanity works, learns, and creates.

And this breakthrough has already set off a frenzy among hedge funds and Wall Street’s top investors.

What most investors don’t realize is that one under-owned company holds the key to this $250 trillion revolution.

In fact, Verge argues this company’s supercheap AI technology should concern rivals.

Before I reveal the details, let’s talk about how some of the richest people on the planet are positioning themselves.

Bill Gates sees artificial intelligence as the “biggest technological advance in my lifetime,” more transformative than the internet or personal computer, capable of improving healthcare, education, and addressing climate change.

Larry Ellison — through Oracle, is spending billions on Nvidia chips and partnering with Cohere to embed generative AI across Oracle’s cloud and apps.

Warren Buffett — not known for tech hype — says this breakthrough could have a ‘hugely beneficial social impact.

When billionaires from Silicon Valley to Wall Street line up behind the same idea — you know it’s worth paying attention to.

Even as we admire what Tesla, Nvidia, Alphabet, and Microsoft have built, we believe an even greater opportunity lies elsewhere…

But the real story isn’t Nvidia — it’s a much smaller company quietly improving the critical technology that makes this entire revolution possible.

And judging by what I’m hearing from both Silicon Valley insiders and Wall Street veterans…

This prediction might not be bold at all:

A few years from now, you’ll wish you’d owned this stock.

The best part? You can discover everything about this company and its groundbreaking technology right now.

I’ve compiled everything you need to know about this groundbreaking company in a detailed, members-only report.

Artificial intelligence is the greatest investment opportunity of our lifetime. The time to invest in groundbreaking AI is now, and this stock is a steal!

AI is eating the world—and the machines behind it are ravenous.

Each ChatGPT query, each model update, each robotic breakthrough consumes massive amounts of energy. In fact, AI is already pushing global power grids to the brink.

Wall Street is pouring hundreds of billions into artificial intelligence—training smarter chatbots, automating industries, and building the digital future. But there’s one urgent question few are asking:

Where will all of that energy come from?

AI is the most electricity-hungry technology ever invented. Each data center powering large language models like ChatGPT consumes as much energy as a small city. And it’s about to get worse.

Even Sam Altman, the founder of OpenAI, issued a stark warning:

“The future of AI depends on an energy breakthrough.”

Elon Musk was even more blunt:

“AI will run out of electricity by next year.”

As the world chases faster, smarter machines, a hidden crisis is emerging behind the scenes. Power grids are strained. Electricity prices are rising. Utilities are scrambling to expand capacity.

And that’s where the real opportunity lies…

One little-known company—almost entirely overlooked by most AI investors—could be the ultimate backdoor play. It’s not a chipmaker. It’s not a cloud platform. But it might be the most important AI stock in the US owns critical energy infrastructure assets positioned to feed the coming AI energy spike.

As demand from AI data centers explodes, this company is gearing up to profit from the most valuable commodity in the digital age: electricity.

The “Toll Booth” Operator of the AI Energy Boom

It owns critical nuclear energy infrastructure assets, positioning it at the heart of America’s next-generation power strategy.

It’s one of the only global companies capable of executing large-scale, complex EPC (engineering, procurement, and construction) projects across oil, gas, renewable fuels, and industrial infrastructure.

It plays a pivotal role in U.S. LNG exportation—a sector about to explode under President Trump’s renewed “America First” energy doctrine.

Trump has made it clear: Europe and U.S. allies must buy American LNG.

And our company sits in the toll booth—collecting fees on every drop exported.

But that’s not all…

As Trump’s proposed tariffs push American manufacturers to bring their operations back home, this company will be first in line to rebuild, retrofit, and reengineer those facilities.

AI. Energy. Tariffs. Onshoring. This One Company Ties It All Together.

While the world is distracted by flashy AI tickers, a few smart investors are quietly scooping up shares of the one company powering it all from behind the scenes.

AI needs energy. Energy needs infrastructure.

And infrastructure needs a builder with experience, scale, and execution.

This company has its finger in every pie—and Wall Street is just starting to notice.

Wall Street is noticing this company also because it is quietly riding all of these tailwinds—without the sky-high valuation.

While most energy and utility firms are buried under mountains of debt and coughing up hefty interest payments just to appease bondholders…

This company is completely debt-free.

In fact, it’s sitting on a war chest of cash—equal to nearly one-third of its entire market cap.

It also owns a huge equity stake in another red-hot AI play, giving investors indirect exposure to multiple AI growth engines without paying a premium.

And here’s what the smart money has started whispering…

The Hedge Fund Secret That’s Starting to Leak Out

This stock is so off-the-radar, so absurdly undervalued, that some of the most secretive hedge fund managers in the world have begun pitching it at closed-door investment summits.

They’re sharing it quietly, away from the cameras, to rooms full of ultra-wealthy clients.

Why? Because excluding cash and investments, this company is trading at less than 7 times earnings.

And that’s for a business tied to:

The AI infrastructure supercycle

The onshoring boom driven by Trump-era tariffs

A surge in U.S. LNG exports

And a unique footprint in nuclear energy—the future of clean, reliable power

You simply won’t find another AI and energy stock this cheap… with this much upside.

This isn’t a hype stock. It’s not riding on hope.

It’s delivering real cash flows, owns critical infrastructure, and holds stakes in other major growth stories.

This is your chance to get in before the rockets take off!

Disruption is the New Name of the Game: Let’s face it, complacency breeds stagnation.

AI is the ultimate disruptor, and it’s shaking the foundations of traditional industries.

The companies that embrace AI will thrive, while the dinosaurs clinging to outdated methods will be left in the dust.

As an investor, you want to be on the side of the winners, and AI is the winning ticket.

The Talent Pool is Overflowing: The world’s brightest minds are flocking to AI.

From computer scientists to mathematicians, the next generation of innovators is pouring its energy into this field.

This influx of talent guarantees a constant stream of groundbreaking ideas and rapid advancements.

By investing in AI, you’re essentially backing the future.

The future is powered by artificial intelligence, and the time to invest is NOW.

Don’t be a spectator in this technological revolution.

Dive into the AI gold rush and watch your portfolio soar alongside the brightest minds of our generation.

This isn’t just about making money – it’s about being part of the future.

This program has provided Applied Behavior Analysis (ABA) therapy to children with autism in military families since 2014.
It recommends reducing administrative barriers that make it harder to start or continue services and allowing ABA providers more flexibility to meet each child’s individual needs.
NASEM also encourages TRICARE to permit ABA services in all appropriate settings, including schools and community environments, where children can best learn and generalize their skills.
Every child deserves access to high-quality ABA services, and every parent deserves a process that supports rather than complicates their child’s care.","The National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine (NASEM) have released an important new report on the Comprehensive Autism Care Demonstration (ACD) program. This program has provided Applied Behavior Analysis (ABA) therapy to children with autism in military families since 2014. After years of study, the report calls for significant changes that could make access to ABA easier, more consistent, and less stressful for families.

The committee’s most important recommendation is that the Defense Health Agency (DHA) should end the ACD and make ABA a basic TRICARE benefit. This would mean ABA is recognized as a medically necessary service, just like speech, occupational, or physical therapy, and would be covered under standard TRICARE benefits rather than through a special demonstration program.

The report also urges DHA to stop requiring unnecessary assessments such as the PDDBI, Vineland-3, and SRS, which have added time and stress for families and providers. It recommends reducing administrative barriers that make it harder to start or continue services and allowing ABA providers more flexibility to meet each child’s individual needs. NASEM also encourages TRICARE to permit ABA services in all appropriate settings, including schools and community environments, where children can best learn and generalize their skills.

These changes would bring TRICARE policies in line with what is already standard practice across most states and insurance plans.

At Butterfly Effects, we strongly support these recommendations. Every child deserves access to high-quality ABA services, and every parent deserves a process that supports rather than complicates their child’s care. This report represents an important step forward in recognizing ABA as an essential, evidence-based service for military-connected families.",https://butterflyeffects.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/butterfly-effects-social-share.jpg,N,0.0,2025-10-22 22:20:04.649245

The at fault driver’s insurance adjuster (from Allstate) reached out to TRICARE to handle the lien process for third party liability.
I’ve tried figuring out who to contact directly, but I’m getting conflicting info about whether it goes through TRICARE West or Carol R Darnall AMC.
Does anyone know: • Which office or contact handles third party liability liens for active-duty service members?
• Is there a specific phone number or email for the Medical Cost Recovery Office or TPO (Third Party Office)?","Hey everyone, I’m hoping someone here can point me in the right direction. The tricare page has been useless so far.

I was involved in an accident in 2024, and was not at fault. The at fault driver’s insurance adjuster (from Allstate) reached out to TRICARE to handle the lien process for third party liability. It’s been about two months, and we still haven’t heard anything back at all from TRICARE.

I’ve tried figuring out who to contact directly, but I’m getting conflicting info about whether it goes through TRICARE West or Carol R Darnall AMC. I’m active duty and the incident happened in Texas.

Does anyone know: • Which office or contact handles third party liability liens for active-duty service members? • Is there a specific phone number or email for the Medical Cost Recovery Office or TPO (Third Party Office)? • Any tips on how to actually get a response from them?

Appreciate any help or insight—this process has been a nightmare to navigate.

Thanks in advance!",,N,0.0,2025-10-22 16:59:29.653942
