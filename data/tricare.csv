Around 9:45 p.m. Thursday, first responders were dispatched to a home in the 1000 block of 11th Avenue in Scottsbluff regarding a fire.

Friday morning, the Scottsbluff Police Department says this turned into a homicide investigation that went into the wee hours of Friday morning.

Captain Lance Kite says that through the course of the investigation, it was determined that 74-year-old Anthony Cervantes had been doused with an accelerant and set on fire, and was found deceased upon first responders arrival. The suspect was identified as Anthony’s son, 44-year-old Elijah Cervantes.

Kite says that both men had resided at that home. An all points bulletin was issued for Elijah Cervantes, and he was subsequently arrested last night on charges of 2nd Degree Murder and 1st Degree Arson.

Also responding last night was the Scottsbluff Fire Department, Gering Police Department, Nebraska State Patrol, Nebraska Fire Marshal’s Office, and the Scott Bluff County CERT Team.

Many of us have heard the sobering facts about China’s growing military might. Beyond its rapidly advancing military, China is also becoming increasingly aggressive in the Indo-Pacific region. In the South China Sea, for example, Chinese military ships continue to harass Filipino vessels to bully the Philippines into submission; and in the Taiwan Strait, China regularly sends military aircraft to intimidate Taiwan.

At some point, China could miscalculate and provoke an all-out war or intentionally initiate military action, potentially drawing the United States into a conflict. A war against a technologically advanced adversary like China would almost certainly result in massive numbers of casualties, unlike anything we’ve seen this century. If deterrence fails, we cannot be caught unprepared, and we must have plans to quickly transport and treat injured servicemembers.

Today, the Military Health System is not prepared to respond to casualties resulting from conflict against a military power such as China. It’s something we must address now—both to fulfill our sacred obligation to those who risk their lives for our country and because our adversaries are becoming increasingly aggressive.

This includes modernizing the National Disaster Medical System (NDMS), which would be called upon to plan, coordinate, and execute our medical response to a mass casualty event like a war. The NDMS is comprised of multiple federal agencies that partner with civilian health care organizations to create a network to care for civilian or military casualties in crises. For this reason, for the past several years I have authorized and funded a pilot program to improve the NDMS, making it easier for different entities to work together and expanding NDMS’s surge capacity to care for more patients.

Last week, during a Senate Armed Services Committee hearing, I questioned experts on how we can continue to strengthen NDMS and prepare our nation for an attack that could quickly overwhelm our health system. At the hearing, the experts urged Congress to find a way to take the lessons learned from the pilot program and apply them going forward.

The experts also underscored the importance of the military partnering with civilian entities such as academic institutions. One institution that works closely with the Military Health System is our own University of Nebraska Medical Center (UNMC). Specifically, UNMC has a leading program for treating patients with highly contagious infectious diseases and on-site training built in partnership with the U.S. Air Force. Military-civilian partnerships like these strengthen the NDMS, while also improving care for both military and civilian patients, by accelerating the exchange of ideas between institutions that would need to collaborate closely if a major war erupted. These partnerships build up future leaders to specialize in medical areas that are relevant to combat.

We all hope that we will never see war against a major military power, but we must live in reality and recognize the growing aggression and capabilities of our adversaries. I’ll be working with my colleagues on the Senate Armed Services Committee to strengthen our national security, which includes improving our Military Health System.

Thank you for participating in the democratic process. I look forward to visiting with you again next week.",https://media-chadronradio.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2024/07/Deb-Fischer.jpg,N,-1.0,2025-03-21 12:56:42.045731

As part of the transition, the DOD is decommissioning the TOL Patient Portal.
Why is the TOL Patient Portal decommissioning?
The MHS GENESIS Patient Portal has replaced the TOL Patient Portal.
Your TOL health records only reflect periods of time when your military hospital or clinic was using TOL.","On April 1, 2025, the TRICARE Online Patient Portal will no longer be available. The Department of Defense’s new electronic health record—MHS GENESIS—has replaced the TOL Patient Portal. As part of the transition, the DOD is decommissioning the TOL Patient Portal.

If you want to keep a copy of your legacy health records for personal use, you must download them from the TOL Patient Portal before April 1, 2025.

“All military hospitals and clinics have transitioned to MHS GENESIS. We encourage you to take these important steps to save your personal health records before the TOL Patient Portal decommissions,” said Rear Adm. Tracy Farrill, Principal Deputy, Assistant Director for Health Care Administration, and Military Health System EHR Functional Champion at the Defense Health Agency. “Your medical history is a valuable resource for managing your health, and saving your records now ensures you have access if you need it.”

Here’s what you need to know before the TOL Patient Portal decommissions.

Why is the TOL Patient Portal decommissioning?

The MHS GENESIS Patient Portal has replaced the TOL Patient Portal. As detailed in the TRICARE Choices in the United States Handbook, MHS GENESIS allows you to access your EHR 24/7. You can also book and cancel appointments, request prescription refills and renewals, see clinical notes and certain test results, and exchange secure messages with your military healthcare team.

The change from TOL to MHS GENESIS eliminates the need to maintain two systems and streamlines EHR management.

What will happen to my records?

Provider access: Your provider will continue to have access to your complete health records.

Personal access: You can use the steps below to download your legacy records for personal use before April 1. You can also request a physical copy from your military hospital or clinic’s records management office. To do this, you’ll need to complete a request form in person, and then return at a later designated time to pick up the records. Beginning April 1, 2025, if you want your legacy health records, you’ll have to follow this process.

Important details

Your records won’t transfer to MHS GENESIS once TOL decommissions.

Your TOL health records only reflect periods of time when your military hospital or clinic was using TOL. Note: If you moved from one duty station to another, and one military hospital or clinic used TOL and the other used MHS GENESIS, your records in MHS GENESIS may have gaps. You’ll find these “gap” records in the TOL Patient Portal. Be sure to download them.

You can only download your records from the past 30 years, from the date you log in to TOL.

Protect your health information. When you download or print your personal health information, it becomes your responsibility to keep it safe. Use secure options. Avoid saving personal data on unsecure devices or platforms.

It’s also important to know that if you’re planning to file a claim with the Department of Veterans Affairs, this decommissioning won’t affect your ability to do so. Providers will still have access to your complete health records.

Can I see my children’s health records?

Yes. You can view all available health data for your children under the age of 12. For children aged 12 to 17, you may view COVID-19, coronavirus, and flu test results, as well as allergies, vitals, and immunization data.

Due to state privacy laws, there are limits to what health data you can view online for your children aged 12 to 17. You can request printed results from your child’s clinic or provider.

Don’t wait—take actionRemember: The TOL Patient Portal will only be available until April 1. Take the time now to download and store your health records to ensure you can easily access them if needed.",https://www.va.gov/img/styles/3_2_medium_thumbnail/public/2025-03/Download%20Files.JPG,N,0.0,2025-03-21 11:56:21.875271

Benadryl Liquid Elixir was sold online for between $16 and $19.","WASHINGTON — Arsell Inc. has announced a voluntary recall of approximately 2,300 bottles of Benadryl Liquid Elixir, sold in 100 mL bottles, due to a potential risk of child poisoning. Impacted products were sold between July 2023 and October 2024 on Amazon.

The recall stems from a violation of the Poison Prevention Packaging Act, which requires child-resistant packaging for products containing diphenhydramine, the active ingredient in Benadryl.

The packaging of the recalled bottles does not meet this safety standard, presenting a risk if young children ingest the medicine.

Recalled products come in a round, dark plastic bottle with a pink and white label that says “Benadryl” in blue text, with safety disclosures and storage instructions on the back. The product was sold in a paper box with a similar design and includes a white label on the bottom with the code “X003VRIGUL.”

There have been no reported incidents or injuries associated with the product, but consumers are urged to immediately remove the product from reach of children.

Arsell is offering full refunds for the recalled bottles. Customers can contact the company by email at recall@arsellsupport.com and will need to provide their Amazon order number and a photo showing the product’s disposal.

Benadryl Liquid Elixir was sold online for between $16 and $19. The product was manufactured in Canada and imported by Arsell Inc. of Brooklyn, New York.

For more information, customers can reach out to Arsell at recall@arsellsupport.com.

The recall comes shortly after Amazon sued the U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission for finding it legally responsible for the recalls of hundreds of thousands of products sold on its site.

The independent federal agency ordered Amazon in January to take several actions, including notifying customers who bought more than 400,000 items covered by recalls and giving refunds to those who could prove the products were properly disposed of or destroyed.",https://media.tegna-media.com/assets/CCT/images/a7c22700-6885-4dd7-b09e-37c99bc8ec9e/20250320T151149/a7c22700-6885-4dd7-b09e-37c99bc8ec9e_1140x641.jpg,N,0.0,2025-03-21 07:56:18.514104

For Berkshire Hathaway employees, the stakes are higher than most.

Warren Buffett, the 94-year-old CEO of Berkshire Hathaway, is offering employees the chance to win $1 million if they correctly predict 30 out of the 32 first-round game winners in this year’s NCAA tournament.

The challenge has become a company tradition, and this year it’s a little easier to win. In the past, employees needed to correctly predict all 32 first-round games. This year, employees must get 30 right.

A perfect bracket through the first 48 games can still unlock a lifetime payout of $1 million annually. This prize was last offered in 2016, but no employee won it.

If no one correctly predicts 30 first-round games, the top employee can still win $250,000.

“I’m getting older,” the 94-year old told The Wall Street Journal about this year’s challenge. “I want to give away a million dollars to somebody while I’m still around as chairman,” he added.

According to NCAA.com, the odds of picking a perfect bracket at random — not even counting the play-in games — is 1 chance out of 2 to the 63rd power, which is 1 in 9,223,372,036,854,775,808, or about 1 in 9.2 quintillion (give or take 20 quadrillion or so). According to University of Hawaii researchers, that is more brackets than the number of grains of sand on Earth.

However, NCAA.com also notes that the odds are more like 1 in 120.2 billion, if the person making the bracket takes into account info about which teams are better and tournament history.

During the 2019 tournament, an Ohio man correctly guessed all the games going into the Sweet 16, according to NCAA.com.

Accreditation Report

Daily Care Fee & RAD Interest Rate Updates

From 1 April 2025, the Maximum Permissible Interest Rate (MPIR) is 8.17%

Since the RAD price approval threshold increased to $750,000 in January 2025, Refundable Accommodation Deposits (RADs) have risen significantly across most aged care homes. For residents, any reduction in the MPIR is a positive change, as it lowers the cost of paying via Daily Accommodation Payments (DAPs).

Key Changes from 20 March 2025:

Basic Daily Care Fee: $63.82 per day

""Fully Supported"" Asset Threshold: $61,500

""Non-Supported"" Asset Threshold: $206,663

Maximum Accommodation Contribution: Refurbished facilities: $69.79 pd Non-refurbished facilities: $45.51 pd

Impact on Aged Care Placements

Aged care facilities continue to prefer residents who pay a RAD upfront rather than those on concessional arrangements. Since lower-tier RADs have increased, the provider-centric income gap between full-paying and concessional residents has widened.

For facilities with more than 40% concessional residents, the effective Refundable Accommodation Contribution (RAC) is now $311,791. However, with the average RAD now sitting well above this amount, it remains challenging for concessional residents to secure placements.

This trend will most likely continue, increasing pressure on those seeking supported placements in aged care homes.

The recall of 46,096 Cybertrucks covers all 2024 and 2025 model years, manufactured from November 13, 2023, to February 27, 2025.
While no injuries have been reported, Tesla showrooms, vehicle lots, charging stations and privately owned cars have been targeted.
Even before the attacks ramped up in recent weeks, Tesla has been struggling, facing increased competition from rival electric vehicles, particularly out of China.
Though largely unaffected by Thursday's recall announcement, Tesla shares have plummeted 42% in 2025, reflecting newfound pessimism as sales crater around the globe.","WASHINGTON, D.C., USA — U.S. safety regulators on Thursday recalled virtually all Cybertrucks on the road, the eighth recall of the Tesla-made vehicles since deliveries to customers began just over a year ago.

The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration's recall, which covers more than 46,000 Cybertrucks, warned that an exterior panel that runs along the left and right side of the windshield can detach while driving, creating a dangerous road hazard for other drivers, increasing the risk of a crash.

The stainless steel strip, called a cant rail assembly, between the windshield and the roof on both sides, is bound to the truck’s assembly with a structural adhesive, the NHTSA report said. The remedy uses an adhesive that’s not been found to be vulnerable to “environmental embrittlement,” the NHTSA said, and includes additional reinforcements.

Tesla will replace the panel free of charge. Owner notification letters are expected to be mailed May 19, 2025.

The recall of 46,096 Cybertrucks covers all 2024 and 2025 model years, manufactured from November 13, 2023, to February 27, 2025. The NHTSA order says that Tesla became aware of the problem early this year.

Videos posted on social media showing people ripping the panels off of Cybertrucks with their hands have gone viral in recent days.

The Cybertruck, which Tesla began delivering to buyers in late 2023, has been recalled eight times in the past 15 months for safety problems, including once in November because a fault in an electric inverter can cause the drive wheels to lose power. Last April, the futuristic-looking trucks were recalled to fix acceleration pedals that can get stuck in the interior trim. Other recalls were related to windshield wipers and the display screen.

It's the latest setback for the Elon Musk-owned electric automaker, which has come under attack since President Donald Trump took office and empowered Musk to oversee a new Department of Government Efficiency that’s slashing government spending.

While no injuries have been reported, Tesla showrooms, vehicle lots, charging stations and privately owned cars have been targeted.

Prosecutors in Colorado charged a woman last month in connection with attacks on Tesla dealerships, including Molotov cocktails thrown at vehicles and the words “Nazi cars” spray-painted on a building.

And federal agents in South Carolina last week arrested a man they say set fire to Tesla charging stations near Charleston. An agent from the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives wrote in an affidavit that authorities found writings critical of the government and DOGE in his bedroom and wallet.

Even before the attacks ramped up in recent weeks, Tesla has been struggling, facing increased competition from rival electric vehicles, particularly out of China.

Kennedy assassination documents released this week, and that is not sitting well with the people affected.
Joseph diGenova, a former campaign lawyer for President Donald Trump, was among those whose personal information was disclosed.
Officials also said new Social Security numbers will be issued to those affected.
The White House did not respond to questions about why the personal information was unredacted.
The National Archive also will offer creditor monitoring services for affected people until they receive their new Social Security numbers, officials said.","DALLAS — Sensitive personal information including Social Security numbers was unveiled in the newly unredacted John F. Kennedy assassination documents released this week, and that is not sitting well with the people affected.

Joseph diGenova, a former campaign lawyer for President Donald Trump, was among those whose personal information was disclosed. He said he is planning to sue the U.S. National Archives and Records Administration for violating privacy laws and is concerned about identity theft.

“It should not have happened,” diGenova said in a phone interview Thursday. “I think it's the result of incompetent people doing the reviewing. I don't believe it had anything to do with rushing the process. The people who reviewed these documents did not do their job.”

His personal information was on documents relating to his work for a U.S. Senate select committee that investigated abuses of power by government officials in the 1970s, including the surveillance of U.S. citizens.

Officials at the White House said Thursday that a plan was in place to help those whose personal information was disclosed, including credit monitoring offered by the National Archives and a screening of the records that began Wednesday to identify all the Social Security numbers that were released. Officials also said new Social Security numbers will be issued to those affected.

The White House did not respond to questions about why the personal information was unredacted.

“President Trump delivered on his promise of maximum transparency by fully releasing the files related to the assassination of President John F. Kennedy,"" White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt said in a statement. ""At the request of the White House, the National Archives and the Social Security Administration immediately put together an action plan to proactively help individuals whose personal information was released in the files.”

The National Archives did not immediately respond to an email seeking comment.

Trump ordered the release of the remaining classified files relating to the 1963 assassination shortly after being sworn into office in January. About 2,200 files consisting of over 63,000 pages were posted on the National Archive's website on Tuesday evening. Many of those pages revealed what had previously been redacted.

The vast majority of the National Archives’ more than 6 million pages of records, photographs, motion pictures, sound recordings and artifacts related to the assassination had previously been released.

The National Archives posted assessments of the newly released documents on its website, but noted that there wasn't enough time as of Wednesday to review more than a small fraction of them. The documents released this week provided more details of Cold War-era covert U.S. operations in other nations, but they didn’t initially lend credence to conspiracy theories about who killed Kennedy.

One of the newly unredacted documents, for example, discloses the Social Security numbers of more than two dozen people seeking security clearances in the 1990s to review JFK-related documents for the Assassination Records Review Board.

Gerald Posner, author of “Case Closed,” which concludes that Lee Harvey Oswald was the lone gunman, said the documents release was rushed, echoing what other researchers believe.

“I know that people will probably shake their head if they hear that — because how could they be rushing in after 62 years?” he said Thursday. “It’s a lot of documents. It’s a lot of files. The Archives in the past has provided a sort of a search guide. So if I want to find James ‘Jesus’ Angleton, for instance, I could do a search and find all the documents he’s in and then I can see what’s different from the last release. This time they didn’t have that.”

Angleton was the CIA's counterintelligence chief from 1954 to 1974,

The National Archives began screening the documents on Wednesday to identify all the Social Security numbers in the assassination records, the White House said.

The National Archives will share those numbers with the Social Security Administration, which will identify the people who are living and issue them new numbers, according to the White House. The National Archive also will offer creditor monitoring services for affected people until they receive their new Social Security numbers, officials said.

Kennedy was killed on a visit to Dallas, when his motorcade was finishing its parade route downtown and shots rang out from the Texas School Book Depository building. Police arrested the 24-year-old Oswald, a former Marine who had positioned himself from a sniper’s perch on the sixth floor. Two days later, Jack Ruby, a nightclub owner, fatally shot Oswald during a jail transfer broadcast live on television.

They argued that DOGE access violates privacy laws and presents serious information security risks.
The staffers were all federal employees allowed to access the data under federal privacy laws, the government argued, and there's no evidence that any personal data was improperly shared.
The Justice Department also said that DOGE access doesn’t deviate significantly from normal practices inside the agency, where employees are routinely allowed to search its databases.","WASHINGTON D.C., DC — A federal judge on Thursday temporarily blocked billionaire Elon Musk’s Department of Government Efficiency from Social Security systems that hold personal data on millions of Americans, calling their work there a “fishing expedition.”

U.S. District Judge Ellen Hollander in Maryland found that the team got broad access to sensitive information at the Social Security Administration to search for fraud with little justification.

“The DOGE Team is essentially engaged in a fishing expedition at SSA, in search of a fraud epidemic, based on little more than suspicion,” she wrote.

The order does allow DOGE staffers to access to data that's been redacted or stripped of anything personally identifiable, if they undergo training and background checks.

“To be sure, rooting out possible fraud, waste, and mismanagement in the SSA is in the public interest. But, that does not mean that the government can flout the law to do so,” Hollander wrote.

The Trump administration says DOGE is targeting waste in the federal government. Musk has been focused on Social Security as an alleged hotbed of fraud, describing it as a “ ponzi scheme ” and insisting that reducing waste in the program is an important way to cut government spending.

The ruling, which could be challenged on appeal, comes in a lawsuit filed by labor unions, retirees and the advocacy group Democracy Forward. They argued that DOGE access violates privacy laws and presents serious information security risks. The lawsuit included a declaration from a recently departed Social Security official who saw the DOGE team sweep into the agency said she is deeply worried about sensitive information being exposed.

DOGE detailed a 10-person team of federal employees at the SSA, seven of whom were granted read-only access to agency systems or personally identifiable information, according to court documents.

The staffers were all federal employees allowed to access the data under federal privacy laws, the government argued, and there's no evidence that any personal data was improperly shared.

The Justice Department also said that DOGE access doesn’t deviate significantly from normal practices inside the agency, where employees are routinely allowed to search its databases. But attorneys for the plaintiffs called the access unprecedented.

Lee Saunders, president of the American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees, called the ruling a “major win for working people and retirees across the country.”

Skye Perryman, president of Democracy Forward, said that “the court recognized the real and immediate dangers of DOGE’s reckless actions and took action to stop it.”

DOGE has gotten at least some access to other government databases, including at the Treasury Department and IRS.

At SSA, DOGE staffers swept into the agency days after Trump’s inauguration and pressed for a software engineer to quickly get access to data systems that are normally carefully restricted even within the government, a former official said in court documents.

The team appeared to be searching for fraud based on inaccuracies and misunderstandings, according to Tiffany Flick, the former acting chief of staff to the acting commissioner.

Hollander, 75, who is based in Baltimore and was nominated by President Barack Obama, is the latest judge to consider a DOGE related case.

The team has drawn nearly two dozen lawsuits. Earlier this week another Maryland judge found that DOGE's dismantling of United States Agency for International Development was likely unconstitutional.",https://media.tegna-media.com/assets/CCT/images/a102139f-c64b-4f6a-8a34-e0fc7147750d/20250319T021908/a102139f-c64b-4f6a-8a34-e0fc7147750d_1140x641.jpg,N,0.0,2025-03-21 04:56:34.078208

What Happened?

On June 4, 2024, medical journal STAT published a report on Zynex entitled “How a device maker inundated pain patients with unwanted batteries and surprise bills.” The report claimed Zynex engaged in an “oversupplying scheme” by sending inordinate amounts of monthly supplies like electrode pads and batteries in order to “bill insurers for thousands of dollars more than it otherwise could.” The report further revealed that, as a result of this practice, insurers were “kicking the company out of network.”

On this news, Zynex’s stock price fell $0.50 per share, or 5%, to close at $9.35 per share on June 4, 2024, on unusually heavy trading volume.

On March 11, 2025, after the market closed, Zynex reported its fourth quarter and full year 2024 financial results, revealing a significant revenue “shortfall” in the quarter “due to slower than normal payments from certain payers.” Zynex further revealed “Tricare has temporarily suspended payments as they review prior claims.” Tricare is the health insurance program for the U.S. military.

On this news, Zynex’s stock price fell $3.59 per share, or 51.3%, to close at $3.41 per share on March 12, 2025, on unusually heavy trading volume.

What Is The Lawsuit About?

The complaint filed in this class action alleges that throughout the Class Period, Defendants made materially false and/or misleading statements, as well as failed to disclose material adverse facts about the Company’s business, operations, and prospects. Specifically, Defendants failed to disclose to investors: (1) that Zynex shipped products, including electrodes, in excess of need; (2) that, as a result of this practice, the Company inflated its revenue; (3) that the Company’s practice of filing false claims drew scrutiny from insurers, including Tricare; (4) that, as a result, it was reasonably likely that Zynex would face adverse consequences, including removal from insurer networks and penalties from the federal government; and (5) that, as a result of the foregoing, Defendants’ positive statements about the Company’s business, operations, and prospects were materially misleading and/or lacked a reasonable basis.

If you purchased or otherwise acquired Zynex securities during the Class Period, you may move the Court no later than 60 days from the date of this notice to ask the Court to appoint you as lead plaintiff.

And at least for one more day, he can enjoy March Madness vicariously through fiancee DaKiyah Sanders. Oh, her? She helped another historically Black university, Southern, reach its own March milestone in the women's NCAA Tournament.

Sanders had four assists, three rebounds, two steals and a block as Southern beat UC San Diego 68-56 in the First Four on Wednesday night for its first March Madness win in seven appearances. Next up for Sanders and Southern is a matchup with No. 1 overall seed UCLA on Friday night.

“It was crazy watching in the hotel the very next day,” Knox said of his fiancee, who played at Alabama State before transferring. “I’m happy for her, and I will be watching her against UCLA.”

Knox's March dance ended Thursday. His buzzer-beater on Tuesday night helped Alabama State edge Saint Francis 70-68 in the First Four. The 16th-seeded Hornets fell 83-63 to No. 1 overall seed Auburn on Thursday in the South Region, with Knox scoring a team-high 18 points.

Tricare covers a range of mental health therapies, including individual therapy, group therapy, and family therapy. Each of these can provide unique benefits. For instance, one-on-one sessions allow for personalized attention while group settings create a community of support. Which one do you think would work best for you?

In addition to therapy, Tricare also supports psychiatry services, which include medication management and psychiatric evaluations. These services can be crucial for those needing medication as part of their recovery. Plus, you might be surprised to learn that Tricare provides coverage for substance use treatment. This comprehensive coverage helps ensure that you get the support you deserve!

Another significant benefit is the coverage for telehealth services. This is particularly helpful for those who may have difficulty accessing in-person appointments. Whether you’re juggling a busy schedule or dealing with mobility issues, virtual therapy can offer the flexibility you need. How convenient is that? 😌

To access these treatments, beneficiaries must work within Tricare’s guidelines. It’s essential to check which providers are in-network to maximize your benefits. Have you considered reaching out to your primary care provider for assistance in navigating your options? They can guide you to the resources best suited to your needs.

Finding Mental Health Providers Accepting Tricare Insurance

When seeking mental health support with Tricare insurance, the quest to find the right provider can feel a bit daunting. But don’t worry! There are plenty of options out there, and knowing where to look makes all the difference. If you’re on Tricare, you have access to a network of mental health professionals who understand your needs and can provide the care you deserve.

One fantastic way to start is by visiting the official Tricare website. Just hop on over there and use their provider search tool! It’s super easy. You can filter your search based on your location, the type of care you want, and whether you prefer in-person or telehealth visits. How cool is that? 🌍💻

Additionally, ask your primary care doctor for recommendations. They often have connections with mental health specialists who accept Tricare. Remember, you deserve a provider who ‘clicks’ with you. Have you considered what qualities are most important to you in a therapist? 🤔

If you’re really looking to broaden your search, consider contacting mental health facilities and private practices directly. Many mental health providers accept various Tricare plans, but they might not always advertise it. Don’t hesitate to reach out and ask! You might discover a great fit that you wouldn’t have noticed otherwise.

Other Resources

Another useful tip? Check out local and national mental health organizations. They often have directories of providers who work with Tricare, and some even offer specific programs designed for active-duty service members and veterans. Remember, you’re not alone in this journey, and there’s support out there waiting for you! 🌟

Finding a mental health provider accepting Tricare can be an adventure in itself, but with these strategies, you’re well on your way to getting the care that will help you thrive. Keep pushing forward—you’ve got this!

Challenges and Limitations of Tricare Mental Health Coverage

Navigating the world of mental health coverage can be daunting, especially when it comes to understanding Tricare’s specific challenges and limitations. While Tricare offers valuable resources for mental health care, it’s important to recognize that there are some hurdles that beneficiaries may face along the way. Have you ever found yourself frustrated when seeking the right support? You’re definitely not alone!

One of the primary challenges with Tricare mental health coverage is the availability of providers. Due to varying reimbursement rates, many mental health professionals might not be inclined to accept Tricare, leading to limited options for beneficiaries. Isn’t it frustrating when you finally find the right therapist but they don’t take your insurance? This can often result in a lengthy search for a provider who meets both your needs and Tricare’s requirements.

Another limitation that many Tricare beneficiaries encounter is the pre-authorization process. It’s not uncommon to have to jump through hoops just to get access to certain services! Some types of therapy may require prior approval, causing potential delays in receiving timely care. Even once you get the green light, remember that coverage can differ based on your location and specific plan. It’s essential to stay informed about your options!

Additionally, certain mental health treatments, like inpatient care or specialized therapies, might have restrictions or require additional documentation. It’s crucial to understand these limitations so you can advocate for your own mental health effectively. What strategies can you employ to ensure you’re getting the best care possible under Tricare? Being proactive and informed is key!

Lastly, the coordination of care can be another challenge. Tricare has different tiers of services, and finding a seamless path between them can be overwhelming. With all these factors in play, it’s vital to keep an open line of communication with your provider and Tricare representatives. Remember, understanding these challenges is the first step in overcoming them on your journey to mental wellness! 💪

Brandon Murray scored 14 of his 21 points in a stifling first half, when the Southland Conference school from Lake Charles, Louisiana, held Clemson to 13 points. After falling behind by as many as 24 in the second, the Tigers rallied, erasing most of a 12-point deficit in the final minute before running out of time.

With its first NCAA Tournament victory, McNeese earned a second-round matchup on Saturday with fourth-seeded Purdue, a 75-63 winner over High Point.

Chris Shumate added 13 points and 11 rebounds for McNeese, which has been best-known this March for its viral, rapping manager and a renegade coach who has reportedly already lined up his next job — at NC State.

The Wolfpack will have to wait at least another 48 hours, because Wade is still needed in Providence.

A 7½-point underdog, McNeese (28-6) held the Tigers to one basket over almost eight minutes during a 17-2 first-half run that turned a tie game into a 23-8 lead. After Clemson (27-7) scored the first three points of the second, the Cowboys ran off nine in a row and led by as many as 24 points.

Jaeden Zackery scored 24 points, Chase Hunter had 21 and Viktor Lakhin grabbed 10 rebounds for Clemson before fouling out with six minutes left in the game.

Takeaways

The once-feared Atlantic Coast Conference is down to two teams: No. 1 seed Duke and North Carolina, one of the last teams in. No. 8 seed Louisville lost to ninth-seeded Creighton in another of the tournament's first games.

Comebacks

With 70 seconds left, Javohn Garcia blocked Zackery twice on the same shot and Shumate streaked toward the basket for the long pass and reverse dunk that gave the Cowboys a 12-point lead.

But Zackery hit a 3-pointer with 45 seconds left to make it a nine-point game, Jake Heidbreder hit one to cut the deficit to six, and then, after Sincere Parker’s reverse dunk brought the crowd to its feet, Zackery hit another 3 to make it 67-62.

After McNeese missed a free throw – one of six missed foul shots in the final six minutes -- Chauncey Wiggins hit a long 3 to make it a 3-point game. Another missed free throw gave Clemson the ball with 10 seconds left, down four.

Hunter drove to the basket, but scored as time expired.

Coaching carousel

Wade was fired from LSU amid an investigation into recruiting violations, and he took a year off before returning to Louisiana at McNeese. In two seasons, he has led the Cowboys to their first back-to-back NCAA Tournament appearances.

Gone cold

Teams have gone cold before – 11 of them have been held to a baker’s dozen or fewer points in the first half – but Clemson is just the second one to do it when seeded fifth or better since the shot clock era began in 1986.

Clemson was 1 for 15 from 3-point range in the first half and made just five baskets before the break.

Up next

The Cowboys head into the Purdue game with a 9-5 record in nonconference games this year, including two losses to SEC teams in the regular season.

It was inside an area the Israeli military ordered evacuated earlier this week, encompassing most of eastern Gaza.
Zaher al-Waheidi, the official in charge of records for the ministry, said a total of 592 people have been killed in Israeli strikes since Tuesday.","GAZA, — Israeli strikes killed at least 85 Palestinians across the Gaza Strip overnight and into Thursday, according to local health officials. The strikes hit multiple homes in the middle of the night, killing men, women and children as they slept.

The Israeli military said it struck militant targets. Later that day, it said that ""projectiles"" fired from Gaza set off air raids sirens in central Israel. It appeared to be the first rocket attack out of Gaza since Israel ended the ceasefire with a surprise bombardment of the territory early Tuesday.

The Israeli military also restored a blockade on northern Gaza, including Gaza City, that it had maintained for most of the war. It warned residents against using the main highway to enter or leave the north and said only passage to the south would be allowed on the coastal road.

It also announced an additional ground operation in northern Gaza near the already largely destroyed town of Beit Lahiya, where strikes have killed dozens over the past 24 hours.

Hundreds of thousands of Palestinians returned to what remains of their homes in the north after a ceasefire took hold in January. Israel resumed heavy strikes across Gaza on Tuesday, shattering the truce that had facilitated the release of more than two dozen hostages. Israel blamed the renewed fighting on Hamas because the militant group rejected a new proposal that departed from their signed agreement.

The Trump administration, which took credit for helping to broker the ceasefire, has voiced full support for Israel. More than 400 Palestinians were killed on Tuesday alone, mostly women and children, according to Gaza's Health Ministry.

The Israeli military said it intercepted a missile launched by Yemen's Iran-backed Houthi rebels early Thursday before it reached Israeli airspace, as air raid sirens and exploding interceptors were heard in Jerusalem. No injuries were reported. It was the second such attack since the United States began a new campaign of airstrikes against the rebels earlier this week.

One of the strikes on Gaza early Thursday hit the Abu Daqa family’s home in Abasan al-Kabira, a village just outside of Khan Younis near the border with Israel. It was inside an area the Israeli military ordered evacuated earlier this week, encompassing most of eastern Gaza.

The strike killed at least 16 people, mostly women and children, according to the nearby European Hospital, which received the dead. Those killed included a father and his seven children, as well as the parents and brother of a month-old baby who survived along with her grandparents.

“Another tough night,” said Hani Awad, who was helping rescuers search for more survivors in the rubble. “The house collapsed over the people’s heads.”

The Israeli military said it had struck dozens of militant targets across Gaza, hitting dozens of fighters as well as military structures.

On Wednesday, Israeli ground troops advanced in Gaza for the first time since the ceasefire took hold in January, seizing part of a corridor separating the northern third of the territory from the south. The announcement about passage to the south indicated troops will soon retake full control over what is known as the Netzarim corridor, stretching from the border to the Mediterranean Sea.

Israel, which has also cut off the supply of food, fuel and humanitarian aid to Gaza's roughly 2 million Palestinians, has vowed to intensify its operations until Hamas releases the 59 hostages it holds — 35 of whom are believed dead — and gives up control of the territory. The Trump administration, which took credit for brokering the ceasefire, says it fully supports Israel.

Hamas has said it will only release the remaining hostages in exchange for a lasting ceasefire and a full Israeli withdrawal from Gaza, as called for in the ceasefire agreement they reached in January after more than a year of mediation by the United States, Egypt and Qatar.

Hamas, which does not accept Israel's existence, says it is willing to hand over power to the Western-backed Palestinian Authority or a committee of political independents but will not lay down its arms until Israel ends its decades-long occupation of lands the Palestinians want for a future state.

Gaza’s Health Ministry said the overnight strikes killed at least 85 people, mostly women and children. Zaher al-Waheidi, the official in charge of records for the ministry, said a total of 592 people have been killed in Israeli strikes since Tuesday.

The Indonesian Hospital said it had received 19 bodies after strikes in Beit Lahiya, near the border.

“It was a bloody night for the people of Beit Lahiya,” said Fares Awad, head of the Health Ministry’s emergency service in northern Gaza, adding that rescuers were still searching the rubble from homes that were hit. “The situation is catastrophic.”

Beit Lahiya was heavily destroyed and largely depopulated during the first phase of the war before January’s ceasefire. On Wednesday, an Israeli strike on a gathering of mourners killed 17 people there, according to health officials.

The war began when Hamas-led militants stormed into southern Israel on Oct. 7, 2023, killing some 1,200 people and taking 251 hostage. Most of the hostages have been freed in ceasefire agreements or other deals. Israeli forces have rescued eight living hostages and recovered the bodies of dozens more.

Israel's retaliatory offensive, among the deadliest and most destructive in recent history, has killed nearly 49,000 Palestinians, according to the Gaza Health Ministry. It does not say how many were militants, but says more than half of those killed were women and children. Israel says it has killed around 20,000 militants, without providing evidence.

The war at its height displaced around 90% of Gaza's population and has caused vast destruction across the territory. Hundreds of thousands of people returned to their homes during the ceasefire, but many found only fields of rubble and the bombed-out shells of buildings.

Judge Mónica Ramírez Almadani granted Carey's request for summary judgment on Wednesday, giving her and co-writer and co-defendant Walter Afanasieff a victory without going to trial.

In 2023, songwriters Andy Stone of Louisiana — who goes by the stage name Vince Vance — and Troy Powers of Tennessee filed the $20 million lawsuit alleging that Carey's 1994 song, which has since become a holiday standard and annual streaming sensation, infringed the copyright of their country 1989 song with the same title.

Their lawyer Gerard P. Fox said he's “disappointed"" in an email to The Associated Press.

Fox said it is his experience that judges at this level ""nearly always now dismiss a music copyright case and that one must appeal to reverse and get the case to the jury. My client will make a decision shortly on whether to appeal. We filed based on the opinions of two esteemed musicologists who teach at great colleges.""

Stone and Powers' suit said their “'All I Want For Christmas Is You' contains a unique linguistic structure where a person, disillusioned with expensive gifts and seasonal comforts, wants to be with their loved one, and accordingly writes a letter to Santa Claus.”

They said there was an “overwhelming likelihood” Carey and Afanasieff had heard their song — which at one point reached No. 31 on Billboard's Hot Country chart — and infringed their copyright by taking significant elements from it.

After hearing from two experts for each side, Ramírez Almadani agreed with those from the defense, who said the writers employed common Christmas cliches that existed prior to both songs, and that Carey's song used them differently. She said the plaintiffs had not met the burden of showing that the songs are substantially similar.

Ramírez Almadani also ordered sanctions against the plaintiffs and their lawyers, saying their suit and subsequent filings were frivolous and that the plaintiffs' attorneys “made no reasonable effort to ensure that the factual contentions asserted have evidentiary support.”

She said they must pay at least part of the defendants' attorney fees.

Defense attorneys and publicists for Carey did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

Carey's Christmas colossus has become an even bigger hit in recent years than it was in the 1990s. It has reached No. 1 on Billboard’s Hot 100 chart the past six years in a row — measuring the most popular songs each week — not just the holiday-themed — by airplay, sales and streaming.

Hundreds of medical groups in the Eastern United States have complained that they are not being reimbursed by TRICARE, which is the primary insurance provider for the military.

Starting January 1st of this year, a new contractor took over reimbursement responsibilities for TRICARE East, which covers all US states East of Mississippi.

But according to Congressman Aaron Bean (R-FL District 4) the rollout has been a disaster.

“Ironically, at least what our research says, that the vendor was changed because there was a problem before,” said Bean.

Bean told Action News Jax hundreds of health care providers, some whose patient populations are as high as 50 percent TRICARE beneficiaries, are not getting reimbursed for the services they’ve provided.

Bean said over 10,000 visits totaling millions of dollars have gone unpaid.

“So, this current vendor is trying to play catch up, but it’s not working,” said Bean.

Bean and Congressman John Rutherford signed onto this letter sent to the Acting Director of the Defense Health Agency demanding answers regarding what steps are being taken to correct the problem, why it happened in the first place, and what will be done to prevent it from happening again.

“Maybe it’s not the vendor. Maybe it’s something else with the payment systems or codes or computer software or something. Whatever it is we gotta fix it,” said Bean.

For now, Bean said military members, like those here in Northeast Florida, still have access to care.

But he fears if this problem goes unresolved, smaller healthcare providers could be put out of business or have to start denying TRICARE patients.

“Men and women shouldn’t have to wait for care, Northeast clinics that treat our men and women in uniform shouldn’t have to worry about the federal government paying the bill. That’s what we do,” said Bean.

Using a non-authorized TRICARE provider means that TRICARE will not cover the bill for the services. The beneficiary is responsible for the total cost of care and does not face fines or loss of privileges. Understanding these rules is vital for managing healthcare expenses efficiently.

Explanation:

Understanding TRICARE and Unauthorized Medical Service Providers

When a TRICARE beneficiary uses a medical service provider that is not authorized by TRICARE, several important consequences can arise. Typically, the most immediate result is that TRICARE will not cover the bill for the services rendered. Beneficiaries are required to seek care from authorized providers to ensure coverage and avoid unexpected expenses.

Using a non-authorized provider does not result in fines for the provider or the beneficiary losing their TRICARE privileges; rather, it simply means that the beneficiary will be responsible for the full cost of the services incurred. Understanding these guidelines is crucial for beneficiaries to effectively manage their healthcare costs while ensuring they receive necessary services.

Conclusion

In summary, using a non-authorized TRICARE provider leads to a lack of coverage for medical expenses, leaving the beneficiary to pay out-of-pocket.

If both Medicare and TRICARE cover a service: • Medicare pays the Medicare-allowed amount.
If you receive a service covered only by Medicare: • Medicare pays the Medicare-allowed amount.
If the service you receive isn’t covered by either Medicare or TRICARE: • Medicare pays nothing.","FALLS CHURCH, Va. – As you age, it’s important to think about your future health needs. If you’re eligible for Medicare at age 65, TRICARE has you covered if you take the appropriate steps. Once you actively have Medicare Part A and Part B, you’re automatically enrolled in TRICARE For Life. TFL coverage allows you to get the care you need while minimizing out-of-pocket expenses.

“TFL is what we call ‘wraparound’ coverage to Medicare for TRICARE-eligible retirees,” said Anne Breslin, TFL program manager, TRICARE Health Plan, at the Defense Health Agency. “Understanding your coverage is key to maximizing benefits and minimizing healthcare costs as you age.”

Here’s what you need to know about TFL.

Signing up for Medicare

You need both Medicare Part A and Part B to get TFL coverage. You’re eligible for Medicare Part A and Part B if you’re:

• Aged 65 or older

• Under age 65 with certain disabilities

• Any age with end-stage renal disease

You must apply for Medicare benefits. As mentioned in the TRICARE For Life Handbook, your initial Medicare enrollment period is a seven-month window. Remember to sign up for Medicare as early as possible. You should sign up for Medicare at least two months before the month you turn 65. This will ensure you don’t experience a gap in coverage.

How to get TFL

Getting TFL coverage is easy–you’ll transition automatically if you:

• Are TRICARE-eligible

• Have Medicare Part A and Part B

You don’t need to fill out any forms, and you don’t pay premiums for TFL coverage.

How Medicare works with TRICARE

Medicare and TRICARE work together to cover your healthcare costs. If both Medicare and TRICARE cover a service:

• Medicare pays the Medicare-allowed amount.

• TRICARE pays the remaining amount.

• You pay nothing.

If you receive a service covered only by Medicare:

• Medicare pays the Medicare-allowed amount.

• TRICARE pays nothing.

• You pay the Medicare deductible and cost-share.

Similarly, if you receive a service covered by TRICARE only:

• Medicare pays nothing.

• TRICARE pays the TRICARE-allowable amount.

• You pay the TRICARE deductible and cost-share.

If the service you receive isn’t covered by either Medicare or TRICARE:

• Medicare pays nothing.

• TRICARE pays nothing.

• You pay any billed charges.

If you have other health insurance based on employment, they pay in the following order:

1. OHI

2. Medicare

3. TRICARE

If your OHI isn’t based on employment, they pay in the following order:

1. Medicare

2. OHI

3. TRICARE

Choosing your provider

To get the most out of your TFL coverage, you should know the difference between Medicare provider types. These include:

• Medicare-participating providers agree to accept the Medicare-allowed amount as payment in full.

• Medicare non-participating providers don’t accept the Medicare-allowed amount as payment in full. They may charge up to 15% above the Medicare-allowed amount, which is then covered by TRICARE.

• Opt-out providers opt out of Medicare and enter private contracts with their patients. Since they opt out, Medicare can’t pay for any healthcare services you receive. TRICARE pays the amount it would’ve paid if Medicare processed the claim. You’re responsible for paying the remaining charges. In this case, you must visit TRICARE-authorized providers and facilities. Otherwise, you may have significant out-of-pocket expenses.

Using TFL overseas

Since Medicare only covers care in the U.S. and U.S. territories (American Samoa, Guam, the Northern Mariana Islands, Puerto Rico, and the U.S. Virgin Islands), there are some key differences you should know. If you get care while living or traveling overseas:

• You must have Part B to remain eligible for TRICARE, even though Medicare doesn't provide coverage overseas.

• TRICARE becomes your primary payer.

• You pay TRICARE’s annual deductible and cost shares.

• You can visit any TRICARE-authorized provider for care.

• Be prepared to pay up front and file a claim within three years of the provided service.

Note that if you’re in the Philippines, you must visit a Philippine Preferred Provider Network or certified providers.

Understanding Medicare Advantage Plans

Although you only need Medicare Part A and Part B to get TFL, you can choose to purchase a Medicare Advantage plan instead. Medicare Advantage plans:

• Are also known as Medicare Part C

• Are offered by private companies that contract with Medicare

• Include services you receive with Medicare Part A and Part B

• Usually include Medicare Part D (pharmacy coverage) and additional benefits

Medicare Advantage plans have additional requirements:

• You may pay a plan premium each month on top of your Medicare Part B premium.

• Generally, you need to use doctors and hospitals within the plan’s network to get the most coverage. This doesn’t apply to emergency services.

• You may have to pay copayments at the time of service. You may need to file your own claim for TRICARE to reimburse copayments for TRICARE-covered services.

Keep in mind, if you have TFL, you still have TRICARE Pharmacy Program benefits at no additional cost. So, you don’t need Medicare Part D to cover your prescription drugs. With Medicare Part D, you may also pay a monthly premium, and you’ll need to follow the plan’s rules for filling prescriptions.

Remember: Coverage rules can change. Always check the official Medicare and TRICARE websites to get the latest information about your coverage.

Dr. Paul Friedrichs testified before the Senate Armed Services Committee on the importance of stabilizing and bolstering America's military healthcare to prepare for future conflicts.

Remote Visualization

Chairman Wicker, Ranking Member Reed and distinguished members of the Committee, thank you for the opportunity to testify on this topic. My last Congressional engagement as the Joint Staff Surgeon in 2023 was with several of you to provide a detailed, classified update on the gaps between Combatant Command requirements for medical support and the readiness of the force elements which the Services organize, train and equip, with support from the Defense Health Agency (DHA), in its role as a Combat Support Agency. It is an honor to be back to share some additional observations on this very timely topic on which Congress needs to act, in order to address critical gaps in our readiness to care for ill and injured Servicemembers.

The opinions and advice I share in this statement and in my testimony are my own; I am not speaking on behalf of any organization with which I am or have been affiliated.

I need to acknowledge several conflicts of interest related to this hearing:

First, and foremost, this is my family’s business…and I care deeply about it. I am the proud son of Seaman Third Class Al Friedrichs, who turned 98 this past January and who served in our Navy at the end of WWII. Multiple other relatives served in the Navy. One of the few really great decisions I have made in my life was to propose to my wife more than thirty years ago, when she was serving as a doctor in the Army. Our kids thought it was incredibly cool that their mom really did wear combat boots. After separating from the Army so that our family could stay together, she has worked for the Veterans Health Administration for decades, continuing her commitment to care for those who volunteer to serve their nation. And one of our children is now a Marine.

Second, I am deeply grateful to have had the opportunity to serve our nation in uniform for 37 years, including three tours as a Commander, as well as service as the Command Surgeon for Alaskan Command, Pacific Air Forces, Air Combat Command and United States Transportation Command, where I oversaw the global aeromedical evacuation system. My last assignment was for four years as the Joint Staff Surgeon, attempting to integrate and synchronize medical support to military operations and family members on every continent and in multiple conflicts and disasters. These experiences have taught me that the rest of the military deploys and fights as a Joint Force, not as individual Service forces. I believe to my core that the military health system is a part of the US military and should adopt the same commitment to joint, integrated capabilities and readiness that the rest of the military has embraced, and I commend Congress for the actions they have taken to try to break down stovepipes and enable greater standardization, interoperability, and integration.

Nearly 250 years ago, our nation was born out of the American Revolution. Historians estimate that between 25,000 and 75,000 members of the Continental Army died during this conflict, with three deaths from illness for every one death from injury. Roughly 1,400 medical personnel served in the Continental Army, but only 10% had any formal medical training. Since then, we have been on a journey to continue improving the care we provide to America’s sons and daughters who serve their nation in uniform and this has resulted in a steady and continuous decline in the percent of injured Service members who died of their wounds. Numerous innovations in both pre-deployment care and the care we provide to deployed personnel have enabled military medics to successfully treat and return to duty more and more ill Service members, enhancing combat capabilities. And for those who sustained injuries in Operational Iraqi Freedom/Operation Enduring Freedom, fewer died than in any conflict in history. This is an extraordinary testimony to the work of countless military doctors, nurses, pharmacists, Corpsmen and other military medics. And it was shaped by Congressional direction in the annual National Defense Authorization Acts (NDAA) and annual appropriations which translated that guidance into reality. Thank you for all that you and your predecessors have done to enable these remarkable results.

As proud as we should be of these unparalleled accomplishments, every organization committed to excellence knows the importance of asking “What could we have done better?” High performing healthcare systems know that “Good enough” is not acceptable, especially when it comes to the health of America’s sons and daughters who choose to defend our nation. Some of our military medical colleagues reviewed the available data on every single Service member who died in recent conflicts and what they found is remarkable: even with nearly total air superiority, unfettered communications, aeromedical evacuation on demand, and largely unhindered supply chains, roughly 25% of those who died prior to 2012 had injuries which should have been survivable. This is an incredibly important—and painful—lesson: We could have done even better.

Unfortunately, we have made insufficient progress towards minimizing preventable battlefield injuries and death. In some cases, we have mistakenly confused loyalty to the patch on our uniforms over our commitment to our patients. We have confused efficiency with effectiveness. We have argued for years about roles and responsibilities and competing interpretations of Congressional intent. Thankfully, because the United States is not involved in large scale combat operations at this time, we have the opportunity, with help from the members of this Committee, to refocus efforts to ensure that, in the next conflict, military members will be medically ready before they deploy and military medics will be well-prepared to care for those Service members who become ill, or who are injured.

The first priority of the military health system must always be our commitment to provide the right care at the right place for every American who volunteers to serve. We must continue to demonstrate to Servicemembers and their families that the military health system will be ready to provide the care they need before they deploy, while in combat, and when they return, and that we will care for their families and for those who have retired from the military. To do so, structural, fiscal and policy changes are needed. After studying this for most of my career, I urge the members of this Committee to reject any recommendations to revert to stovepipes and siloes of care. There is no data to support the premise that any one Service delivered better care in garrison or down range and ample evidence from multiple conflicts that the best outcomes for patients occur when medics work together (like the rest of the military does when it deploys). I am dismayed that some colleagues continue to assert that some members of Congress appear to question the merits of integrating medical capabilities as directed in 2017; this perception has complicated efforts to focus as a Joint medical team on improving care to Servicemembers who rely on military medics to be ready when needed. I strongly oppose any recommendations for another large-scale reorganization of the military health system; these take years to implement and will continue to distract my colleagues from the important job of improving care by requiring them to instead focus on building new bureaucracies. I believe the DOD has the capabilities it needs, although, as I will address below, not the resources, to truly achieve the vision of great care, anywhere for our those who go in harm’s way in defense of our nation. Attachment One, National Defense Authorization Act Recommendations, summarizes recommended language for the Committee’s consideration. (NOTE: For any recommendations which fall outside the purview of this Committee, I respectfully request that Committee staff share the recommendations with the appropriate Committee, and, if possible, convey the intent of this Committee related to the recommendation.)

Roles and Responsibilities: In 39 years of government service, and especially in military health system “governance” meetings, I have been dismayed at the amount of time and energy dedicated to this topic at the expense of discussing how to improve the effectiveness and efficiency of care. I remain deeply grateful for and supportive of the changes directed in the 2017 National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA). Congress wisely recognized that Servicemembers’ anatomy and physiology do not vary based on the patch they wear and that we can deliver better care if we work as an integrated system, rather a system of competing systems. Other than a few niche environments (e.g., care in low gravity environments, undersea medicine, etc.), the Senate should direct standardization of equipment and training for deployable medical force elements, as recommended by the Joint Trauma System (JTS) and also that medical force elements must be interoperable (i.e., a Role 2 medical force element from one Service can combine with a Role III 3 medical force element from another Service, when directed by the Combatant Commander in order to provide the right combination of capabilities to care for ill and injured Service members). Almost every other modern military has already done so, and, as our Israeli and German and other colleagues have repeatedly shown, military medics deliver more effective care more efficiently if we standardize and integrate capabilities. The only structural changes I recommend are:

Dual-hat the Joint Staff Surgeon as the Defense Health Agency Deputy Director for Combat Support and align key operational support capabilities under this two-star leader, as described below and in Attachment 1.

Require the Combatant Commands to implement the Combatant Command Trauma System staffing requirements to ensure readiness to collect, analyze and share data on ill and injured in their Area of Operations in order to continue to improve the care our nation’s defenders receive.

Require the Defense Health Agency (DHA) to reinstate Defense Health Agency Procedural Instruction 6040.06, Combatant Command Trauma Systems.

Evolving Threats: Care for ill and injured is challenging and there are clearly opportunities to improve that care. And the range of threats to which military medics must be prepared to respond is growing.

Disease, Non-Battle Injury (DNBI): Military service is a challenging calling, and many medical conditions impact the ability of an individual to perform his or her duties. The military asks those seeking to enlist or to become officers to voluntarily identify preexisting medical conditions and, based on that information, determines whether the member is likely to be medically qualified to perform their assigned duties. The introduction of electronic health records has made it easier to validate the information provided by those seeking to serve in the military and, in some cases, has identified medical conditions which the applicant did not voluntarily report. Some have claimed that this additional visibility into pre-existing medical conditions is contributing to lower enlistment rates, although there has been limited data to support this assertion. These pre-existing, chronic medical conditions may degrade the member’s readiness and frequently increase the military health system costs once the member is on active duty. Clarifying the impact of identifying pre-existing medical conditions on both recruiting and on military health system costs can help inform decisions about whether to continue to seek this information. Furthermore, roughly 80% of deployed service members who require medical care have medical conditions unrelated to traumatic injuries. The most common medical conditions which cause a Service member to no longer be “medically ready” include dental, musculoskeletal and mental health conditions. Across the Services, more than 7% of the force is not medically ready prior to deployment, immediately decreasing the effectiveness of combat units. To preserve the fighting force, military medics must be able to rapidly diagnose these conditions and safely and effectively treat them as close to the front lines as possible. This committee should:

Require an annual report on actions taken to reduce the number of uniformed personnel who are not medically ready to no more than 5% of the force and the actions taken to improve the ability to care for deployed Servicemembers with DNBI as close to their deployed location as possible in order to sustain the operational capabilities of their unit.

Require the Services to provide an annual report to Congress on the number and type of medical waivers granted to those enlisting in the military (e.g., accession waivers), the number of personnel who receive accession waivers and are later determined to be medically unfit for duty, including the number and type of accession waivers granted as a result of the use of the Military Health System Genesis application (i.e., the military’s electronic health record) and any data on the impact of the use of GENESIS on accession rates.

Antimicrobial Resistance (AMR): One of the risks for Service members with traumatic injuries is developing wound infections, especially in austere environments. Bacteria or fungi which are resistant to multiple antibiotics are growing domestically and globally and this has become an increasing challenge for military casualties in Europe, Asia and Africa. This Committee should require an annual report on steps taken by the Miliary health system to detect and to mitigate AMR in military personnel and should review the proposed Pasteur Act language to enhance support to develop new antimicrobials to protect our Servicemembers.

Emerging Weapons: Mankind has continued to seek new military capabilities which will afford an asymmetric advantage over competitors and potential adversaries. Recently developed new technologies like hypersonic missiles and directed energy weapons do not appear to create revolutionary changes in risk, but, overtime, may cause new patterns of injury which military medical personnel must be prepared to treat. Waiting until new patterns of injury are seen to begin planning for appropriate care should be unacceptable. This Committee should:

Direct the Intelligence Community to prepare an annual report on new and updated weapons which create risk to Service members.

Direct DOD to ensure that the Joint Staff Surgeon and select members of the Joint Trauma System and Service Surgeons’ staffs have sufficient clearances to receive these updates.

Direct the Joint Staff Surgeon, in coordination with the Services, the Joint Trauma Analysis and Prevention of Injury in Combat program and the JTS, to provide Congress with a classified annual assessment of changes needed to training and other military medical capabilities to ensure military medical personnel are ready to care for casualties from these new or upgraded weapons systems, including actions taken by the Services to address findings from prior years’ assessments.

Burden Shifting: In 2020, the National Academies of Science, Engineering and Medicine published an analysis which highlighted the lack of resilience and surge capacity in the US healthcare system. The recent pandemic unfortunately validated that lack of resilience and, as part of the mitigation efforts to protect the American public, as many as 70,000 military medics deployed to augment the US healthcare system through Defense Support to Civil Authorities (DSCA) taskings. The National Disaster Medical System, which was designed to integrate DOD, VA and civilian healthcare systems in case of a surge in military or civilian patients has been allowed to atrophy. The Regional Emerging Special Pathogen Treatment Centers, which are funded to care for patients exposed to, or infected with highly contagious infectious diseases (e.g., Ebola), have very limited bed capacity; and the ability to move these patients depended on capabilities in other agencies which apparently have been eliminated. In addition, only the DOD had the contracting authorities needed to enable Operation Warp Speed to achieve so much so quickly. And recent actions that reduce capabilities in other Federal Departments, including the ability to respond to disasters at home and abroad are typically mitigated by shifting those responsibilities to the Department of Defense. Because of this, the Military Health System is likely to see more taskings in the future to compensate for these reduced capabilities in other parts of the Federal government. I recommend this Committee should:

Require an annual assessment by the Departments of Defense, Health and Human Services and the Veterans Health Administration of the resilience of the US healthcare system and the readiness of the National Disaster Medical System to support DOD operational requirements during Large Scale Combat Operations, including the readiness to transport, receive and care for military personnel, US government employees and US civilians who are exposed to or infected with highly contagious infectious diseases.

Require ASD(HA) to provide an annual summary of all healthcare support provided to other Departments and Agencies which was not funded in the DOD budget, as well as any reimbursements received for that support.

Authorize ASPR to execute the same contracting authorities that DOD utilized during Operation Warp Speed.

Sustain ASPR and CDC programs which help state and local health authorities continue to improve the readiness of their jurisdictions and make that support contingent on a commitment to participate in NDMS and, for those hospitals with the appropriate capabilities, RESPECT.

Biological weapons and other threats: The confluence of artificial intelligence, increasing computational capacity and rapidly evolving biotechnological advances offers incredible potential for new treatments. And there will always be people who will seek to misuse these new technologies for nefarious purposes; these rapid advances significantly lower the bar for state and non-state actors to use good technologies in ways that increase the risk to the American public and to military members in future conflicts. The best deterrent to ensure these weapons are never used is to demonstrate that we will rapidly detect their use, attribute it appropriately, and hold those responsible accountable, while demonstrating the ability of our health system to rapidly mitigate the impact of acute biological threats. The foundational research creating these advances was largely based on research funded by the Federal government through the National Science Foundation, National Institutes of Health, and the Department of Defense. It is critical that the military health system, in collaboration with the Departments of Health and Human Services, Energy, Homeland Security and the Veterans Health Administration continue to invest in research to rapidly develop better tests, treatments and vaccines for new and emerging biological threats, as well as in enhanced domestic and global biosurveillance capabilities. As noted above, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the Administration for Preparedness and Response should continue to help fund state and local preparedness efforts to increase resilience to future biological threats. The Department of State should reinstate funding for programs which enhance biopreparedness capabilities in other countries to improve our ability to detect if a bioweapon or other biological threat is occurring outside the US and to assist in mitigating the impact of those threats. The 2018 National Biodefense Strategy, which was updated in 2022, and the 2023 Biodefense Posture Review outline multiple actions needed to enhance our ability to deter nations and non-nation states from pursuing or considering employing bioweapons. The Bipartisan Commission on Biodefense in 2024 released its updated National Blueprint for Biodefense. The 2020 NDAA also wisely tasked the Defense Science Board to “carry out a study on the emerging biotechnologies pertinent to national security,” and that report should be released this year. Similarly, the report from the National Security Commission on Emerging Biotechnologies (NSCEB) is scheduled for release next month and both these new reports will provide valuable advice to DOD and to Congress to inform how we best leverage these technologies to enhance our national, economic and health security. Unfortunately, it appears that at least some of the progress made during the past 8 years is being undone by sweeping reductions in resourcing for scientific research, surveillance, medical countermeasures and Federal, state and local all hazards response programs. This Committee should:

Direct DOD to provide Congress with a classified and unclassified update on implementation of the 2023 Biodefense Posture Review (BPR) within 6 months, including any remaining gaps in capabilities and mitigation plans to address those gaps.

Direct DOD to publish an update BPR which addresses all recommendations relevant to DOD from the 2024 National Blueprint for Biodefense and the 2025 NSCEB and DSB reports by the end of Fiscal Year 2025.

Direct the DOD to ensure that all DOD hospitals and operational labs, including those located overseas, provide the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention the same data that is submitted by other public health jurisdictions to enhance global and domestic biosurveillance.

Manpower Constraints: Enhancing the readiness of the military health system to care for ill and injured Service members relies, in part, on having the right number and type of military medics. The Health Resources and Services Administration (HRSA), in November, 2024, updated the Health Workforce Projections for multiple career fields. For nursing, they estimate that the current shortages in nursing cannot be significantly mitigated until 2037, at the earliest and noted a “significant geographic maldistribution” of nurses. This appears to be largely in rural areas where many military bases are located. For physicians, the projections are even more dire, with 31 out of 35 physician specialties projected to have insufficient supply by 2037 and an aggregate shortfall of 187,130 physicians across the US. Efficiency advocates have asserted that the military health system can eliminate military medical positions and either hire civilian replacements or shift the care to the private sector. In reality, the military health system is able to sustain the current level of care because it trains many of its medical personnel internally. Given the Congressionally-directed restrictions on increasing civilian physician training programs, closing military training programs will exacerbate both military and civilian medical workforces shortages and further degrade readiness due to even greater shortages of uniformed medical personnel. Efficiency advocates have also attempted to eliminate or substantially reduce military medical billets for specialty codes which are not required in Operational or Contingency plans; this seemingly logical action ignores the reality that mission critical training programs for critical care nurses, trauma surgeons and other specialties needed in wartime cannot maintain their accreditation to continue training unless they are in a hospital with pediatric, obstetrical and other “non-mission critical” departments. And all these workforce challenges are reportedly being exacerbated by decreasing retention of key medical officer and enlisted specialists due to a perception that they cannot sustain their medical skills in the current system due to the low volume of ill or injured patients in most military hospitals. I recommend that this committee should:

Ensure that any proposed reductions in military medical training pipelines are only implemented if Congress authorizes and appropriates funding for additional civilian training capacity to support military requirements.

Require the Services to provide updates to ASD(HA) and the Joint Staff Surgeon on recruiting and retention of officer and enlisted medical personnel by specialty code or equivalent designator and an analysis of reasons for separation by specialty code.

Direct the ASD(HA) and the Veterans Administration Undersecretary for Health to provide an assessment within one year of opportunities to increase physician, nurse and other medical training pipelines by integrating and expanding training programs.

Direct the ASD(HA) to develop a plan and cost estimate to increase the number of officer and enlisted students trained at the Uniformed Services University to address shortfalls in current training pipelines and to assist the Services in improving recruiting and retention of military medical personnel required to meet operational requirements.

Require the Services to account for authorizations required for military medical training as operational requirements, including those for specialties which are required to maintain accreditation of training programs for surgical, critical care, and other operational capabilities.

Logistical Constraints: The military health system (MHS) prepares and sustains the warfighter, while the defense logistics enterprise (DLE) prepares and sustains the equipment and supplies used by the warfighter. The two are inextricably linked. Almost all resupply of medical units depends on non-medical logistical capabilities and capacity. Almost all deploying medical personnel travel on non-medical commercial or military logistical platforms. And almost all movement of ill and injured Service members who cannot return to the fight is conducted on non-medical logistical platforms. The Joint Staff Logistics Director (J4) routinely performs a “Logistic Feasibility Assessment” of Operational and Contingency Plans to determine if the proposed military operation can be logistically supported. No similar analysis has routinely been performed for medical support. In addition, as part of previous efficiency efforts, the military health system converted from a system which planned for combat to one which prioritized the efficiencies garnered from “just in time resupply.” The United States has the highest number of medications in short supply ever recorded; an analysis in 2024 by the Office of Pandemic Preparedness and Response Policy found that these shortages were not consistently found in other key partners (e.g., European countries, Japan, Korea or India), suggesting that policy actions similar to those taken by other countries could mitigate some of these shortfalls. In addition to shortages of finished pharmaceuticals, assessments by the Joint Staff have found that deployable assemblages which are expected to be resupplied during large scale combat operations contain medications and/or equipment from potential adversaries, or from a sole source which may not continue provide these items during a conflict. And recent analyses of generic pharmaceuticals have demonstrated variability in the efficacy of some medications. I recommend that this Committee should:

Direct the CJCS to include a Medical Feasibility Assessment whenever a Logistics Feasibility Assessment is conducted or updated and ensure the two are deconflicted as part of regular updates to Operational and Contingency Plans and ensure the ASD(HA) and Services review the results to identify gaps which can be mitigated through changes to policy or Defense Health Program or Service Operations and Maintenance funding.

Require the CJCS to provide an annual report on DOD operational medical supply chain vulnerabilities and actions taken or needed to reduce these vulnerabilities.

Direct the DOD to provide a report to Congress within one year on options to mitigate gaps in patient movement capabilities and capacity in the Continental United States during execution of the Integrated Continental United States Medical Operations Plan, including leveraging Civilian Reserve Air Fleet assets to execute this mission.

Codify that all future United States Transportation Command Mobility Capability Requirements Studies include medical transportation requirements for personnel, equipment and patient movement, as validated by the Joint Staff Surgeon.

Partnerships: In the operating room, I was part of a team which included nurses and anesthesiologists and other key contributors who cared for the patient who trusted us to cure his or her cancer, or to repair the damage from a traumatic injury. As a flight surgeon on aeromedical evacuation missions, I was part of a team which included medics and pilots and other key personnel who worked together to safely move an ill or injured Servicemember to the care they needed. As a medical leader in our Joint Force, I was part of teams which met Combatant Command requirements by leveraging the best of each Service, and by partnering with key industry and academic and international stakeholders to ensure the next ill or injured Service member was cared for by a military medic who had the appropriate training and equipment and supplies to provide the right care at the right place and time. The American College of Surgeons has been an especially valuable partner for many years, helping to improve care in both the military and civilian healthcare systems by sharing information and research through the Military Health System Strategic Partnership with the American College of Surgeons (MHSSPACS), enabled by the Mission Zero Act. The University of Nebraska and the University of Colorado are two examples of the strong academic partners which have helped military medicine continue to innovate and improve how we train, equip and sustain the skills of military medics. In addition, because so many military bases are located in rural areas, DOD relies heavily on community partners to provide care for Servicemembers and other DOD beneficiaries. Finally, our plans to provide necessary medical care in future conflicts and contingencies are currently built on the assumption that we will be joined by allies and partners, as we have been in every major conflict for more than a century. I recommend this Committee:

Require the DoD to include medical industrial base partners identified by the Services and DHA in future Defense Industrial Base planning efforts and Joint and Service exercises involving other industry partners.

Require ASD(HA) to provide an annual report on access to care in rural communities impacted by changes in funding for Medicaid, Medicare or other Federal health programs.

Direct the DOD to provide a classified report to Congress on any assumptions regarding access to or reliance on allies and partner nations for medical care for US military personnel during future large scale combat operations and the impact on patient care if the United States changes its relationship with these nations.

Reauthorize funding for the Mission Zero Act for military civilian partnerships.

Research and Innovation: The United States has led the world in investments in research which have enabled the United States to be the leader in multiple industries which support military medical care. Academic research centers which have long provided some of the most innovative breakthroughs in medicine are facing significant challenges due to the announced implementation of a standardized 15% Indirect Cost Rate for research funded by the National Institutes of Health, regardless of the complexity of the research performed, as well as the planned 60% reduction in funding for the National Science Foundation, and reductions in research funding from the Veterans Administration and the United Stated Department of Agriculture and the Department of Defense, compounded by the proposed ten-fold increase in taxes on university endowments which might have helped mitigate the impact of some of these changes. Within the military health system, research funding has been divided between the Congressionally Directed Research Program (CDRP), which funds research on topics identified by members of Congress, and the remaining research budget, which should address gaps in knowledge and capabilities impacting care for ill and injured Servicemembers. I recommend that this Committee:

Require the DOD to provide a report to Congress within 60 days of the impact of actual and proposed reductions in Federal research funding on national security and on the ability to continue to pursue innovations and treatments for ill and injured Servicemembers.

Direct CJCS to prepare an annual prioritized list of military medical knowledge gaps requiring research, based on Combatant Command and Service inputs, which will be provided to the ASD(HA) to inform research funded by the Defense Health Program.

Require the Director of the Defense Health Agency to provide an annual report to Congress showing how research oversight by the DHA addresses the operational gaps identified by CJCS, as well as a summary of any patents awarded and peer-reviewed publications in the past year as a result of military health system-funded research.

Share the CJCS-identified priority gaps in knowledge impacting care for ill and injured Servicemembers with members of Congress to help inform decisions about new CDRP projects.

Fiscal Realities: The United States Federal budget dramatically exceeds revenues and is unsustainable. The United States healthcare system is the most expensive system in the world on a per capita basis and delivers some of the worst outcomes of any high income country. With the current workforce, the annual US healthcare inflation rate has averaged 5.11%. The Military Health System is a subset of the US healthcare system; 70% of care for DOD beneficiaries is now purchased in the private sector, but the MHS has seen effectively almost no growth in funding for medical care over the past ten years. In addition, numerous new benefits have been authorized without additional funding. Because our current Tricare contracts are “must-pay” bills for the Department, the only way to cover these rising costs is to divert resources from the direct care system and from accounts which should be funding operational medical requirements. Assertions that care can continue to be diverted to the private sector without impacting readiness or access have not been supported by data and the growing shortages of medical personnel nationally and the rapidly rising cost of commercial care appear to make this unsustainable course to enhance military medical readiness. Until this is addressed, we will continue to see declining operational medical capabilities and rising costs as more and more care is shifted to the private sector. Civilian healthcare is expensive; military healthcare, because of its unique additional requirements, is even more expensive. Like other military capabilities, there are no direct analogues in the civilian or commercial sector for all the capabilities needed by the military health system to be able to care for ill and injured Service members during a conflict. All of the Federal healthcare delivery systems (DOD, Veterans Health Administration, Indian Health Services, etc.) face some of the same challenges and all have very large, unfunded infrastructure requirements to sustain their ability to deliver care (e.g., DOD estimates an additional $10 billion is needed to update or replace existing medical infrastructure). In many communities with aging Federal medical infrastructure, there is an opportunity to develop Joint Venture partnerships similar to the ones at Joint Base Elmendorf-Richardson, or Travis Air Force Base. In addition, creative financing mechanisms, like the Communities Helping Invest through Property and Improvements Needed for Veterans ACT (CHIP-IN Act), which pools Federal, state, local and philanthropic resources to fund infrastructure requirements, should be reauthorized and expanded to include the DOD. Finally, as authorized by Congress in the 2017 NDAA, the DHA must ensure accurate tracking and billing for services provided to non-DOD beneficiaries both within the direct care system and when military medical personnel are working in partner facilities. The mistaken belief that the military or other Federal health systems can be funded at lower rates than the civilian sector while achieving similar or better outcomes and be ready for future conflicts is a remarkably optimistic triumph of hope over reality. To begin to address this foundational problem, this Committee should:

Require that any implementation of new benefits which are authorized in an NDAA cannot occur until there is an assessment by CJCS of operational impacts, an independent government cost assessment of the cost of mitigating the operational impacts and of the cost implementing the benefit in both the direct and private care system, and sufficient additional funding is appropriated in the Defense Health Program to cover these costs.

Direct that any proposed reductions in services at a military treatment facility can only proceed with an endorsement from the CJCS that there is no impact on operational requirements, and an endorsement from the Services that there is no impact on medical officer and enlisted training pipelines, and an independent attestation that there is sufficient excess capacity to absorb the workload to be shifted to the community , as well as Congressional notification at least 180 days prior to implementation.

Direct the ASD(HA) to implement the necessary information technology tools and to promulgate policy on accounting for work done by uniformed medical personnel in civilian or Veterans Health Administration facilities.

Reauthorize the CHIP-IN Act and amend it to include DOD requirements.

Mandate that the DOD and VA provide a report to congress in six months on how to consolidate inpatient care in communities where one or both Departments are requesting funding for infrastructure investments which exceed $100 million annually.

Uniformed Military Medical Leadership: Congress wisely recognized that successful implementation of the reforms mandated by the 1986 Goldwater-Nichols Act required a new type of leader who understood the value of Jointness and who had personal experience in that environment. For a variety of reasons, military medical leaders have been exempted from this requirement, making them the outliers in the Department of Defense, with limited understanding of the opportunities and challenges implicit in the Joint Force. I recommend that this Committee should:

Remove the Goldwater-Nichols Act exception for military medical General and Flag Officers.

Require that any future Directors of the Defense Health Agency must have previously served as either the Joint Staff Surgeon, or as a Combatant Command Surgeon and must have commanded a hospital which supported Graduate Medical Education programs.

The counties impacted are Butler, Jefferson, Maries, Ozark, and St. Louis. The city of St. Louis is also impacted.

To receive an emergency refill of prescription medications, TRICARE beneficiaries should take their prescription bottle to any TRICARE retail network pharmacy. If the bottle is unavailable or the label is damaged or missing, beneficiaries should contact Express Scripts, Inc., or their retail network pharmacy for assistance.

To find a network pharmacy, beneficiaries may call Express Scripts at 1-877-363-1303, or search the network pharmacy locator.

If possible, visit the pharmacy where the prescription was filled. Prescriptions filled by a retail chain may be filled at another store in that chain. If the clinician who prescribed the medication is available, beneficiaries can ask them to call in a new prescription to any network pharmacy.

As a reminder, TRICARE beneficiaries, other than active duty service members, may receive urgent care from any TRICARE-authorized urgent care center or provider and do not need a referral. This allows beneficiaries to seek nonemergency care for illnesses or injuries if their primary care provider is unavailable because of emergencies. Any TRICARE beneficiary who reasonably believes they have an emergency should always call 911 or, go to the nearest emergency room.

Beneficiaries are advised to visit Express Scripts’ Weather Notices page for updates.

How Medicare works with TRICARE Medicare and TRICARE work together to cover your healthcare costs.
If both Medicare and TRICARE cover a service: Medicare pays the Medicare-allowed amount.
If you receive a service covered only by Medicare: Medicare pays the Medicare-allowed amount.
If the service you receive isn’t covered by either Medicare or TRICARE: Medicare pays nothing.","As you age, it’s important to think about your future health needs. If you’re eligible for Medicare at age 65, TRICARE has you covered if you take the appropriate steps. Once you actively have Medicare Part A and Part B, you’re automatically enrolled in TRICARE For Life. TFL coverage allows you to get the care you need while minimizing out-of-pocket expenses.

“TFL is what we call ‘wraparound’ coverage to Medicare for TRICARE-eligible retirees,” said Anne Breslin, TFL program manager, TRICARE Health Plan, at the Defense Health Agency. “Understanding your coverage is key to maximizing benefits and minimizing healthcare costs as you age.”

Here’s what you need to know about TFL.

Signing up for Medicare

You need both Medicare Part A and Part B to get TFL coverage. You’re eligible for Medicare Part A and Part B if you’re:

Aged 65 or older

Under age 65 with certain disabilities

Any age with end-stage renal disease

You must apply for Medicare benefits. As mentioned in the TRICARE For Life Handbook, your initial Medicare enrollment period is a seven-month window. Remember to sign up for Medicare as early as possible. You should sign up for Medicare at least two months before the month you turn 65. This will ensure you don’t experience a gap in coverage.

How to get TFL

Getting TFL coverage is easy–you’ll transition automatically if you:

Are TRICARE-eligible

Have Medicare Part A and Part B

You don’t need to fill out any forms, and you don’t pay premiums for TFL coverage.

How Medicare works with TRICARE

Medicare and TRICARE work together to cover your healthcare costs. If both Medicare and TRICARE cover a service:

Medicare pays the Medicare-allowed amount.

TRICARE pays the remaining amount.

You pay nothing.

If you receive a service covered only by Medicare:

Medicare pays the Medicare-allowed amount.

TRICARE pays nothing.

You pay the Medicare deductible and cost-share.

Similarly, if you receive a service covered by TRICARE only:

Medicare pays nothing.

TRICARE pays the TRICARE-allowable amount.

You pay the TRICARE deductible and cost-share.

If the service you receive isn’t covered by either Medicare or TRICARE:

Medicare pays nothing.

TRICARE pays nothing.

You pay any billed charges.

If you have other health insurance based on employment, they pay in the following order:

OHI

Medicare

TRICARE

If your OHI isn’t based on employment, they pay in the following order:

Medicare

OHI

TRICARE

Choosing your provider

To get the most out of your TFL coverage, you should know the difference between Medicare provider types. These include:

Medicare-participating providers agree to accept the Medicare-allowed amount as payment in full.

Medicare non-participating providers don’t accept the Medicare-allowed amount as payment in full. They may charge up to 15% above the Medicare-allowed amount, which is then covered by TRICARE.

Opt-out providers opt out of Medicare and enter private contracts with their patients. Since they opt out, Medicare can’t pay for any healthcare services you receive. TRICARE pays the amount it would’ve paid if Medicare processed the claim. You’re responsible for paying the remaining charges. In this case, you must visit TRICARE-authorized providers and facilities. Otherwise, you may have significant out-of-pocket expenses.

Using TFL overseas

Since Medicare only covers care in the U.S. and U.S. territories (American Samoa, Guam, the Northern Mariana Islands, Puerto Rico, and the U.S. Virgin Islands), there are some key differences you should know. If you get care while living or traveling overseas:

You must have Part B to remain eligible for TRICARE, even though Medicare doesn't provide coverage overseas.

TRICARE becomes your primary payer.

You pay TRICARE’s annual deductible and cost shares.

You can visit any TRICARE-authorized provider for care.

Be prepared to pay up front and file a claim within three years of the provided service.

Note that if you’re in the Philippines, you must visit a Philippine Preferred Provider Network or certified providers.

Understanding Medicare Advantage Plans

Although you only need Medicare Part A and Part B to get TFL, you can choose to purchase a Medicare Advantage plan instead. Medicare Advantage plans:

Are also known as Medicare Part C

Are offered by private companies that contract with Medicare

Include services you receive with Medicare Part A and Part B

Usually include Medicare Part D (pharmacy coverage) and additional benefits

Medicare Advantage plans have additional requirements:

You may pay a plan premium each month on top of your Medicare Part B premium.

Generally, you need to use doctors and hospitals within the plan’s network to get the most coverage. This doesn’t apply to emergency services.

You may have to pay copayments at the time of service. You may need to file your own claim for TRICARE to reimburse copayments for TRICARE-covered services.

Keep in mind, if you have TFL, you still have TRICARE Pharmacy Program benefits at no additional cost. So, you don’t need Medicare Part D to cover your prescription drugs. With Medicare Part D, you may also pay a monthly premium, and you’ll need to follow the plan’s rules for filling prescriptions.",https://media.defense.gov/2025/Mar/20/2003673262/2000/2000/0/250320-O-D0202-1001.PNG,N,0.0,2025-03-20 14:56:27.667168

The new health care benefit, initiated last September by then-Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin, allows service members to contribute up to $3,300 in pretax earnings per year to an account that can be used to pay for eligible health care expenses that aren't covered by the military health system or Tricare.

Defense officials said the benefit is likely to help service members with families the most, and especially those enrolled in the Exceptional Family Member Program, as they are more likely to encounter unforeseen medical expenses or needs that aren't covered by Tricare.

""No health care, no health insurance program is going to cover every cost, and many costs are unforeseeable,"" Ronald Garner, the Defense Department's assistant director of military compensation policy, said in a news release.

The Internal Revenue Service determines the contribution limits and eligible expenses each year, but they commonly include Tricare deductibles and cost sharing for military families on Tricare Select; over-the-counter medications; medical devices; dental and vision care, including glasses and contact lenses; and non-covered treatments like massage, acupuncture and chiropractic care.

""If your child gets sick in the middle of the night, you're not going to wait until you can go see a doctor to get some cold medicine. You're going to run down to the local pharmacy and grab some cold medicine and bring it back so that you can take care of your child. That's a cost that will be covered,"" Garner said.

Health care FSAs are common in private industry as well as the federal government, where civilian employees have had access to the benefit for years. In announcing the creation of the benefit for service members, Austin said the efforts would improve quality of life, which in turn helps troops focus on their duties.

""Doing right by our all-volunteer joint force and their families is a core readiness issue. Taking care of our people is fundamental to the department's ability to recruit and retain the most talented American patriots and to ensure that the U.S. military remains the most lethal fighting force on the planet -- and it is simply the right thing to do,"" Austin said in a Sept. 13 memo.

According to the DoD, dual-service married couples can maintain two separate accounts and contribute as much as $6,600 each year. Reservists, National Guard members on active Guard and reserve duty, and members of the U.S. Coast Guard Reserve on active duty for more than 180 days also are eligible to participate.

The minimum contribution to open an account is $100 per year.

The current enrollment period runs through March 31. Service members who for now choose not to participate can enroll for 2026 during open season, which runs from November through early December, or can enroll during a qualifying life event, such as a move, birth of a child or marriage.

Garner said families need to look closely at their medical expenses to determine whether an FSA would benefit their financial situation. According to the Federal Flexible Spending Account Program, or FSAFEDS, savings average 30% on eligible health care expenses.

In a statement on the Military Officers Association of America website, Karen Ruedisueli, the organization's director of government relations for health affairs, said the accounts can help military families save money because the funds have no employment or federal taxes deducted and they are excluded from gross income when calculating income tax.

""Health care FSAs can also help with budgeting: By contributing to an FSA, military families can set aside funds for anticipated medical costs, which may make managing expenses more predictable,"" Ruedisueli added.

Troops access their accounts by submitting receipts for expenses to be reimbursed. Funds placed in the accounts must be used by the end of the year. Those who re-enroll for the following year can carry over $660.

To sign up, service members must go to the FSAFEDS website. Accounts typically will be accessible within a few business days of enrolling and the funds available to cover expenses immediately.

According to the DoD, nearly 47% of the service members are married and roughly 37% have children.

""When service members are having to worry less about the welfare of their families and their financial welfare, they are more focused on the mission. And I think that can only benefit the organization,"" Garner said.

So this is where I get confused. If I have to pay the full amount upfront then who reimburses me for the difference between the full amount and the allowed amount plus what 15% of the allowed amount would be.

The provider is legally allowed to charge me 15% of the allowed amount so in this case $4.50 that I would owe the provider. So what happens to the difference between the full amount $100 and the allowed amount $30 + the 15% of the allowed amount $4.50 which would be $65.50 in this case. Who reimburses you that money??

Studying how to prevent or mitigate brain injuries remains a key focus area for the Defense Health Agency. The science of the brain and brain injuries touches every capability that readiness demands.

For 25 years, more than 18,000 people from military families, local communities, and Department of Defense affiliates have visited the National Museum of Health and Medicine to participate in Brain Awareness Week activities.

In 2000, the NMHM partnered with the Dana Alliance for Brain Initiatives (now the Dana Foundation) to develop an educational program to coincide with International Brain Awareness Week. The program led middle- and high-school students (grades 5-12) through activities and stations with neuroscientists from universities, foundations, professional societies, museums, and hospitals to learn about advances in brain research, how the brain works, and possibly to inspire a new generation of neuroscientists.

“Brain Awareness Week came from the desire to expose students to the most powerful organ in the human body in an environment and in a manner that was enjoyable, fun, immersive, and educational at the same time,” said Archie Fobbs, the museum’s neuroanatomical collections manager.

Fobbs has participated as a presenter since the inception of the event. The NMHM Neuroanatomical Collections, one of the most comprehensive brain collections in the world was one of the main motivators to partner with the Dana Alliance and host BAW activities.

Over the years, the number of presenters grew, and the topics and activity stations became more specialized. Stations showed examples of brain injury and disease while discussing prevention and treatment, informed on how sports-related concussions contribute to tactile, speech, and language disorders, and taught about the impacts of traumatic brain injury because of recent military conflicts.

While the museum was housed at the then Walter Reed Army Medical Center, NMHM staff saw firsthand how patients recovered from TBIs. BAW shifted to focus on presenters and activities that centered on brain injury awareness research related to prevention, diagnosis, treatment, and rehabilitation of the warfighter and how it affects advancements in the civilian sector. When the museum moved to its current location in Silver Spring, Maryland, an entire gallery was dedicated to the brain.

One of the museum’s longest-running presenters is the Defense Health Agency’s Traumatic Brain Injury Center of Excellence, whose first BAW activity station occurred in 2002 when the organization was named the Defense and Veterans Brain Injury Center.

""The Traumatic Brain Injury Center of Excellence is proud to have been a part of the museum's Brain Awareness Week activities for over 20 years. Every year, we look forward to the opportunity to educate the public about why it's important to protect, treat, and defend their brain health. We've been able to drive this point home over the years through interactive activities such as egg drops, helmet fitting, and a mirror box that simulates how the brain changes after concussion,” said Dr. Katie Stout, chief of the Traumatic Brain Injury Center of Excellence.

Other presenters throughout the years include National Institutes of Health institutes and centers, the Society for Neuroscience, DoD centers of excellence, Howard University, Rutgers University, University of Maryland, Georgetown University, and the Walter Reed Army Institute of Research’s Sleep Research Center, among others.

During the COVID-19 pandemic, NMHM closed its doors on Friday, March 13, 2020, just a few days before they would have welcomed students and presenters for its 20th BAW.

Not to be deterred, during the next two years, NMHM produced a social media campaign each March called “Back to Basics: The Brain,” with an accompanying online lab notebook for at-home activities. The videos showcased presentations by a collection of DoD partner organizations, including TBICoE, the Psychological Health Center of Excellence, the Hearing Center of Excellence, the Uniformed Services University, the U.S. Army Medical Research and Development Command, WRAIR, and several NIH organizations.

BAW returned in person with Brain Awareness Day as a two-hour public event on March 18, 2023.

“For a quarter century, NMHM has been a forum for expanding awareness for the neurosciences among the public and professionals alike. We often have visitors come back years later after participating in a Brain Awareness Week program, and they tell us how much they were impacted by their experiences interacting with our Neuroanatomical Collections and all of the brain experts. It’s an experience that both inspires curiosity and even careers,” said Andrea Schierkolk, NMHM’s public programs manager.

This year, NMHM celebrated its 25th year of Brain Awareness Week activities with a Brain Awareness Day on Saturday, March 15. Presenters included NMHM Anatomical Collections staff, TBICoE, PHCoE, HCE, the Vision Center of Excellence, Uniformed Services University, Society for Neuroscience, and the National Intrepid Center of Excellence.",https://d1ldvf68ux039x.cloudfront.net/thumbs/photos/2503/8926403/1000w_q95.jpg,N,0.0,2025-03-20 13:56:28.718064

CA Behavioral Health accepts inpatient TRICARE insurance coverage for drug rehabilitation and alcohol recovery.

Inpatient Residential Coverage for Substance Use Disorder (SUD) Treatment in Palm Desert, CA Inpatient residential substance use disorder (SUD) treatment provides a secure environment that prioritizes addiction recovery.
Inpatient Residential Coverage for Dual Diagnosis Treatment in Palm Desert, CA Inpatient residential dual diagnosis treatment in Palm Desert will prioritize residential substance abuse treatment while also addressing any co-occurring mental health disorders.","TRICARE is a program the United States Department of Defense manages, specifically designed for active-duty military personnel and their dependents. Notable aspects of TRICARE’s behavioral health recovery services encompass substance abuse treatment, medication-assisted treatment (MAT), residential inpatient care, medically supervised detoxification, and outpatient services, including partial hospitalization programs (PHPs).

TRICARE is available to active-duty service members, retirees, and their families. As a government-funded health insurance program, it operates differently from the customary underwriting of private insurance plans, such as indemnity agreements. Unlike private insurers that evaluate risk founded on your age, health, and other factors, TRICARE eligibility is determined solely by military service status without considering individual risk factors. Funded by federal resources, TRICARE typically does not rely on reinsurance. This healthcare program also steers clear of endorsements, umbrella policies, or the involvement of insurance adjusters, although it can seek subrogation from responsible third parties.

Insured active-duty service members often will not face any addiction treatment costs. However, other beneficiaries may be responsible for out-of-pocket expenses, including premiums, copayments, or meeting specific deductibles. The fees, which an actuary determines, will vary based on your policy. To minimize claims costs, it is essential to receive treatment from in-network providers. Some services may require prior authorization before treatment, and your unforeseen peril may entail risks for loss. Additionally, TRICARE may have coverage exclusions, including experimental treatments or luxury rehabilitation facilities.

TRICARE does offer coverage for residential inpatient care for alcohol and drug addiction rehab treatment in Riverside County. To amplify your benefits, seeking treatment at rehabilitation centers that accept TRICARE is vital. Additionally, it’s important to understand the coverage levels of your policy thoroughly, including any exclusions, prior authorization requirements, or limitations on the length of treatment.

Key factors are being informed about submitting claims and knowing your deductible. Neglecting this information may result in unexpected out-of-pocket costs. CA Behavioral Health accepts inpatient TRICARE insurance coverage for drug rehabilitation and alcohol recovery. We can authenticate the aspects of your insurance coverage, ensuring you’re well-equipped to make informed choices regarding your rehabilitation needs.

Various inpatient residential treatment programs, including those available at CA Behavioral, accept TRICARE rehab in Southern California. While this is not an exhaustive list, some of the covered residential treatment options include alcohol use disorder (AUD) treatment, substance use disorder (SUD) treatment, and dual diagnosis treatment. To discover more about our in-house recovery options, please contact us at California Behavioral.

Inpatient Residential Coverage for Alcohol Use Disorder (AUD) Treatment in Palm Desert, CA

Residential inpatient care for Alcohol Use Disorder (AUD) provides continuous support with around-the-clock care. These rehab programs help you navigate the initial symptoms of alcohol withdrawal with services, including detoxification, therapy, counseling, medication-assisted treatment (MAT), relapse prevention, and alternative care options.

Inpatient TRICARE insurance coverage for AUD treatment is available in Palm Desert. Typically, covered services include inpatient care, medication-assisted treatment (MAT), detoxification, counseling and therapy, and aftercare planning. It’s crucial to thoroughly understand your policy, as your benefits may require prior authorization and might only provide coverage for a limited duration at a specific facility.

Inpatient Residential Coverage for Substance Use Disorder (SUD) Treatment in Palm Desert, CA

Inpatient residential substance use disorder (SUD) treatment provides a secure environment that prioritizes addiction recovery. Key elements of these programs include a structured daily routine, continuous supervision, medical detoxification, peer support, custom-made treatment plans, and a solid emphasis on achieving lasting sobriety.

TRICARE usually covers inpatient SUD rehabilitation programs, but it is essential to select an in-network facility and likely obtain prior authorization. There may be some financial responsibilities on your part. Additionally, specific exclusions could influence the duration of your treatment and may not cover specific experimental therapies.

Inpatient Residential Coverage for Dual Diagnosis Treatment in Palm Desert, CA

Inpatient residential dual diagnosis treatment in Palm Desert will prioritize residential substance abuse treatment while also addressing any co-occurring mental health disorders. Integrating holistic mental health care is essential for achieving a sustainable recovery from dual diagnosis, as it helps to break the cycle of dependency and relapse that can result from untreated mental health challenges.

TRICARE normally covers inpatient dual diagnosis treatment, but it’s crucial that you choose an in-network facility. It’s also possible that you may have to secure prior authorization. Your coverage levels within your policy will determine your out-of-pocket costs.

The costs related to inpatient addiction treatment under TRICARE insurance in Riverside County will vary based on the specific services needed, the pricing of your chosen treatment center, and your TRICARE plan. TRICARE often covers a significant portion of the treatment expenses; however, it’s possible that you may still have to pay for some out-of-pocket costs, such as co-pays or deductibles.

If you need help navigating your coverage and understanding potential expenses, contact us at California Behavioral Health. Our committed team will provide a comprehensive breakdown of the total cost of your addiction treatment and clarify your insurance benefits.",https://cabehavioral.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/tricare-insurance.png,N,1.0,2025-03-20 17:59:50.138415

Smith, urging to improve TRICARE compensation in Northeast Florida.

As Rep. Bean explained, constituents have worried about the failure of T-5 contracts under the TRICARE program, where delays are common, and millions of dollars in compensation have been unpaid or unprocessed.

""This crisis has put smaller practices at risk of shutting down, jeopardizing access to care for thousands of military families across the country,"" Rep. Bean continued, adding, ""In Northeast Florida, service members and their families are already facing reduced access to medical care. We have heard from mothers pleading for our help to resolve the billing issues to make sure their children do not lose access to physical therapy, behavioral health providers, and surgical services. The most vulnerable are left hanging in the balance as these payment delays continue.""

Moreover, local medical practices serving TRICARE beneficiaries cannot meet demand, reducing or discontinuing services and potentially shuttering.

NBC News covered TRICARE East's slowness at the beginning of March, which affected not only Northeast Florida but also other parts of the East Coast.

As a result, the Florida Congressman demanded answers on how the delays would be solved when healthcare providers would be reimbursed, the number of beneficiaries at risk of losing coverage, and how the DHA would reach out to them.

TRICARE is not the first government service in Northeast Florida that Bean has criticized for working slowly. In October, he demanded answers from the Postal Service (USPS) on why mail had been continually lost or slow.

S.C. - The 628th Medical Group began using the Defense Health Agency virtual care system Feb. 10, providing service members additional access to medical care.
“It's a great new tool in our toolbox,” said U.S. Air Force Maj. Caleb Lesselles, 628th MDG practice manager.
According to Pritchett, people from all walks of life are treated at Joint Base Charleston.
“Moving forward our hope is that members of Joint Base Charleston will receive better medical care and attention using the DHA virtual consultation,” Pritchett expressed.","Joint Base Charleston. S.C. - The 628th Medical Group began using the Defense Health Agency virtual care system Feb. 10, providing service members additional access to medical care.

Virtual consultations allow patients and doctors to discuss symptoms, diagnoses, and prescriptions completely through electronics.

“It's a great new tool in our toolbox,” said U.S. Air Force Maj. Caleb Lesselles, 628th MDG practice manager. “It allows for further reach of the providers to our patient population.”

This new technology ensures a more patient-centered appointment and consultation, providing flexibility for service members and their families.

Patients can now book appointments around job schedules and family needs, mitigating time off of work. The patient receives timely notifications to their phone throughout the duration of the consults, allowing for a more connected and informed experience.

The DHA created the Virtual Education Center tool to help gauge and educate patients. The VEC equips patients to take command of their health-care. According to the DHA, patients who are well informed may make fewer appointments and require fewer medical procedures.

“From a mental health perspective, I think it's honestly super beneficial,” said U.S. Air Force Senior Airman Amanda Pritchett, 628th Operational Medical Readiness Squadron mental health supervisor and Alcohol Drug and Abuse Prevention technician.

According to Pritchett, people from all walks of life are treated at Joint Base Charleston. Whether it's a home situation or work concern, there are issues that need to be talked about. Rather than having to reschedule due to circumstances arising that prevent a patient from attending physically, the option to have a virtual appointment grants the person the same level of care.

The DHA uses virtual technology to partner with outside contracts such as the Enterprise Behavioral-Health Resources and Virtual Resource Clinical Services, that host telehealth psychiatrists to assist patients with virtual consults.

Since the roll-out of the virtual consultation, Lasselle and Pritchett have acknowledged that the overall user feedback has been good, both expressing their desire for patients to receive medical care in a timely fashion.

“Moving forward our hope is that members of Joint Base Charleston will receive better medical care and attention using the DHA virtual consultation,” Pritchett expressed. “And to be more satisfied with the medical staff assigned to the base.”

The DHA's vision transcends traditional healthcare boundaries and provides unwavering and exceptional healthcare support to service members, retirees, and their families.",https://cdn.dvidshub.net/images/dvids_logo.svg,N,1.0,2025-03-20 12:57:02.719453

TriWest Healthcare Alliance has a history of fraud allegations, including a $10 million settlement in 2012 for failing to pass on negotiated discounts to TRICARE and a $179.7 million settlement in 2020 for overpayments related to the VA's PC3 and Choice Programs. Here's a more detailed look: 2012 Settlement: In 2012, TriWest agreed to pay $10 million to resolve allegations that they failed to give TRICARE the benefit of negotiated discounts with service providers, submitting claims at higher rates and pocketing the savings. Whistleblower Lawsuit: The 2012 settlement stemmed from a lawsuit filed by four former TriWest employees under the False Claims Act, alleging that TriWest defrauded the government. 2020 Settlement: In 2020, TriWest agreed to pay $179.7 million to resolve allegations of overpayments from the VA in connection with its administration of the PC3 and Choice Programs. Alleged Overpayments: The 2020 settlement resolved allegations that TriWest retained overpayments from the VA, including payments for the same services twice and payments for services where TriWest received full or partial reimbursement from other healthcare providers. TriWest's Role: TriWest is a contractor to TRICARE Management Activity, administering TRICARE benefits in the West Region. Current Fraud and Abuse Reporting: TriWest utilizes pre-payment and post-payment fraud detection tools and resources to monitor and analyze various beneficiary, provider, and claim data for potential fraud, waste, and abuse.

The recent transition to TriWest Healthcare Alliance as the new contractor for TRICARE West has been marked by significant issues, including problems with beneficiary payment updates, provider network changes, and delays in accessing customer service and processing referrals. Here's a breakdown of the key issues: Payment Update Problems: Beneficiaries who pay for TRICARE coverage with debit, credit card, or bank transfer faced difficulties updating their payment information on the TriWest online portal, with some reporting long wait times to reach customer service. Provider Network Changes: Many beneficiaries and healthcare providers raised concerns about the new TriWest provider network, which was smaller than the previous Health Net Federal Services network. Customer Service Issues: Beneficiaries reported ""unending delays in reaching TriWest customer service"" and difficulties with the TriWest website and call centers. Referral and Authorization Processing: TriWest's referral portal experienced issues, affecting the processing of new referrals and some beneficiaries' specialists couldn't access approvals in the TriWest system. Coverage Gaps and Unpaid Claims: Some beneficiaries reported that they were not able to get their claims processed, leading to coverage gaps and unpaid bills. Extended Deadlines: The deadline for beneficiaries to update their payment information was extended twice, with the final deadline being February 28th. Referral Waiver: A TRICARE referral approval waiver was put in place, effective January 1 – March 31, 2025, to address issues with processing referrals.

Despite efforts by these parties to contact TRICARE independently, many have not seen their issues resolved.
TRICARE beneficiaries are experiencing unfathomable delays.
This crisis has put smaller practices at risk of shutting down, jeopardizing access to care for thousands of military families across the country.""","U.S. Congressman Aaron Bean, representing Florida's 4th District, along with Congressman John Rutherford from the 5th District, have addressed a letter to Dr. David J. Smith, the acting Director of the Defense Health Agency (DHA). The letter raises concerns about reimbursement issues affecting TRICARE beneficiaries and medical providers in Northeast Florida.

Congressman Bean has been receiving feedback from constituents and healthcare providers regarding problems with TRICARE compensation. Despite efforts by these parties to contact TRICARE independently, many have not seen their issues resolved.

The lawmakers stated: ""We have heard from countless concerned constituents that the new T-5 contract has had a severe impact on our military families and community medical providers. Providers across the nation have reported millions of dollars in unpaid or unprocessed claims. TRICARE beneficiaries are experiencing unfathomable delays. This crisis has put smaller practices at risk of shutting down, jeopardizing access to care for thousands of military families across the country.""

The full text of the letter details further issues faced by service members and their families in Northeast Florida who are experiencing reduced access to medical care due to billing problems. Some mothers have expressed concerns over their children's continued access to necessary health services such as physical therapy and surgical services.

Providers serving TRICARE beneficiaries report significant financial strain due to unpaid services, with some clinics owed substantial amounts—upwards of $100,000—which affects around 30% of their patient population who are TRICARE patients.

The congressmen stressed that it is critical for this situation to be resolved swiftly to prevent military families from losing essential healthcare coverage. They posed several questions seeking clarity on when reimbursement delays would be resolved and what measures are being taken to prevent similar issues in the future.",https://s3.amazonaws.com/jnswire/jns-media/84/e0/22543432/webp_ds30s6a6lrwhkf36ohfrkf838kel.webp,N,-1.0,2025-03-20 00:26:11.705782

Any dentist or dental hygienist approved to provide dental care in their state qualifies as an authorized provider. You can receive TDP benefits from any authorized provider, though you’ll usually save money by choosing a network dentist.

Network dentist

A network dentist has signed a contract with United Concordia, the TDP contractor, to accept the TDP’s allowable charge as full payment for covered services. These dentists offer discounted fees compared to the normal rates in your area. You also don’t have to pay for the full cost of care and wait for reimbursement. Network dentists coordinate TDP’s payment with United Concordia directly.

Non-network dentist

This is any dentist who hasn’t signed a contract with United Concordia. While you can still see these providers, you may have higher out-of-pocket costs.

TRICARE OCONUS preferred dentist

TRICARE OCONUS preferred dentists are dentists who have agreements with United Concordia to participate in the TDP. These providers will bill United Concordia directly for the program’s share of costs and offer English-language services. While you can see any licensed dental provider overseas, choosing a TOPD can make the process smoother.

Diagnostic services

These are services that help your dentist decide what dental care you need. Examples include X-rays and periodontal evaluations. These services are essential for proper treatment and procedure planning.

Orthodontic services

These services treat problems with your bite and speech. Common treatments include braces, retainers, and other devices that help align teeth properly.

Periodontal services

These treatments address diseases affecting the tissues surrounding and supporting your teeth, such as your gums. Regular cleanings help prevent periodontal disease, while you might need more advanced treatments for existing conditions.

Plan year

Your annual maximum benefit amount applies to this 12-month period, so keeping track of the plan year helps you manage your dental care expenses.

Understanding these terms can help you make better decisions about your dental care. By knowing how your TDP works, you can maximize your benefits and minimize out-of-pocket costs.

Allowable charge

This is the maximum amount United Concordia will pay for a dental service. For network dentists, the allowable charge is either their normal fee or a negotiated lower rate. If you visit a non-network dentist, you might need to pay the difference between the allowable charge and what your dentist bills.

Coordination of benefits

If you have more than one dental plan, United Concordia will work with your other insurance to determine which plan pays first and which pays second. Always file claims with your primary plan first, then submit to the secondary plan after receiving payment from the primary.

Testimony from Detective Stacey Rutherford:

At 8:15 p.m., a call was received reporting a shooting in Harvest. Just a few minutes later, dispatch confirmed a lone subject inside the store who appeared to be dead. Radio traffic alerted deputies to the situation.

Witnesses reported that Williams attempted to flag down vehicles near a field less than a quarter mile from the scene. Several individuals were in the parking lot, including a couple who were inside the Circle K when the shooting occurred.

Upon arrival, deputies found nothing disturbed in the lobby; all items were behind the counter. However, there were large amounts of blood and some items in disarray.

Detective Rutherford explained that multiple surveillance cameras in the store captured the incident. A screenshot showed the suspect standing at the counter, reaching over the customer closest to the register to produce a firearm and shoot Taylor North.

After executing a search warrant, investigators found clothing matching that seen in the screenshot, as well as pairs of white gloves, a gun, a shirt, and jeans in a bag belonging to Williams. He admitted that the gloves found in the bag were his.

Rutherford stated that the video showed Williams entering the store at 8:03 p.m., shooting North, and leaving in less than 30 seconds. When located later, Williams had changed his clothes.

During questioning from the defense, witnesses Henderson and DJ, who were at the counter during the incident, provided their accounts. A total of 185 crime scene pictures and videos from six surveillance cameras were presented as evidence. The shell casing from the scene and the weapon found were confirmed to be a match through ballistic testing.

Naval Station Guantanamo Bay.","GUANTANAMO BAY, Cuba – Dr. Stephen Ferrara, Acting Assistant Secretary of Defense for Health Affairs, visited U.S. Naval Hospital Guantanamo Bay to engage with leadership and staff on Feb. 27, 2025.

Ferrara’s visit underscores his commitment to engaging with medical personnel at military hospitals and clinics across the Military Health System to better understand their challenges and ensure they have the resources necessary to provide exceptional care.

As the principal advisor to the Secretary of Defense and the Undersecretary of Defense for Personnel and Readiness, Ferrara oversees health policy, programs, and force health protection across the MHS. “There is no substitute for boots-on-the-ground to understand the nature and complexity of any mission, especially one this complex,” Ferrara said. “I wanted to ensure the team was receiving the support they need to execute their mission successfully. U.S. Naval Hospital Guantanamo is a particularly vital military hospital in a remote location with a unique mission set, so seeing both the daily operations and unique operations like the joint expeditionary MEDEVAC training was invaluable for understanding the hospital's specific needs and how I can best support their critical work from my position. As the Acting Assistant Secretary of Defense for Health Affairs, I have a unique responsibility for detainee care, making it important that I gain a firsthand understanding of that unique mission.”

Managing a geographically remote military hospital comes with challenges in manning and occasionally supply chain procurement. Hospital Director U.S. Navy Capt. Tammy Servies, who also serves as commanding officer for U.S. Navy Medicine Readiness and Training Command and commander of Joint Task Force Guantanamo’s Joint Medical Group, doesn’t let that impede the mission with her focus on a ready medical force and a medically ready force. “We were very excited to welcome Dr. Ferrara to Guantanamo,” Servies said. “We provide care to a diverse community, including service members, their dependents, government civilian employees, contractors, and foreign national workers. It was very gratifying to show Dr. Ferrara that no matter who walks through our doors, we are committed to delivering high-quality, reliable health care. Our mission is rooted in operational readiness and wellness, ensuring that those we serve receive the best possible care.

“The health, wellness, and readiness of every service member I lead as the CO of USNMRTC Guantanamo, matters to me personally,” Servies continued. “My team cannot adequately care for others if they are not healthy themselves.”

During his visit, Ferrara met with a cross-section of sailors from every department within the hospital to speak with them and listen to what matters to the most junior members of the hospital team. “The dedication and resilience of the entire medical staff left a lasting impression on me,” Ferrara said. “It's one thing to hear about the demands of operating in a remote location, but witnessing the team's unwavering commitment to providing top-notch care across a range of disparate environments was truly inspiring.”

Servies echoed the significance of Ferrara’s visit, emphasizing the impact of leadership engagement in understanding the realities of providing health care in a remote setting. “Despite the challenges we face, my team never fails to amaze me with their willingness to take on every mission that comes our way,” Servies said. “Whether providing support to Joint Task Force Guantanamo, Joint Task Force Southern Guard, or managing the daily operations and patient load from our local community, these military and civilian personnel show an indomitable spirit and mental toughness that sometimes leaves me in awe.”

Ferrara’s visit highlights the ongoing efforts to strengthen military health care delivery and support the dedicated medical personnel who stand ready to serve whenever and wherever they are needed. “The experience underscored the critical importance of the hospital's mission within the broader context of Guantanamo Bay,” Ferrara said. “The team's ability to maintain a constant state of readiness, adapt to diverse needs, and seamlessly collaborate with other units is a testament to their professionalism and commitment to excellence. The isolation of Guantanamo Bay is also easy to underestimate until walking the spaces. The team here has a mission like no other in the Military Health System.”

The Defense Health Agency manages military hospitals and clinics across the Department of Defense, integrating health care services to enhance readiness, improve patient outcomes, and streamline medical operations.

Desirae Pierce has twice helped transform how naval hospitals care for their tiniest patients. Now, as U.S. Naval Hospital Guam's lead for the innovative Neonatal Stabilization and Treatment (NeST) team, she's enhancing care for newborns who need specialized medical support.

“We are increasing our ability to provide necessary and critical care for our smallest and most vulnerable beneficiaries,” said Dr. Paul Cordts, Deputy Assistant Director, Medical Affairs. “The progress the NeST Working Group has achieved in less than a year is a testament to the entire team, but particularly the team at Naval Hospital Guam.”

NeST is a specialized team of medical professionals comprised of a neonatologist, neonatal intensive care nurses, and respiratory therapists who stabilize premature babies and newborns with health complications until they can be transported to a facility with a neonatal intensive care unit.

While the island of Guam does not have an accredited NICU, Pierce, who is a neonatal nurse practitioner, and her team have significantly increased the hospital's ability to care for newborns who need additional medical support.

Pierce explained that the NeST team has enabled a more nuanced approach to caring for some newborns who require specialized care. ""Previously, an aeromedical evacuation was initiated almost immediately for newborns who required specialized care,"" she said.

While the implementation of NeST does not delay evacuations, ""the team is capable of providing stabilization care and treatment for longer durations of time for newborns” who are stable enough to receive care on island, if the anticipated length of their treatment is about 10 days.

This marks Pierce's second tour advancing neonatal care within military health care. From 2013 to 2016, she helped establish the Special Care Nursery at Naval Hospital Camp Lejeune, eventually serving as its nurse manager. Now at USNH Guam, she's helping to lead another transformative effort in neonatal care.

""In my 17 years of service, I have twice had the privilege of playing a direct part in advancing neonatal care within a Naval Hospital,"" Pierce said. ""The path has been arduous, but with the continued support of the hospital and the Defense Health Agency, the future of neonatal care where America's day begins looks bright.""

Evolution of Care

The NeST program evolved from its predecessor, the Neonatal Stabilization Team (NeoSTAT) model, to expand specialized care for newborns born prematurely or with health complications. Recognizing Guam's geographic isolation—more than 1,400 miles from the NICU at USNH Okinawa and nearly 4,000 miles from Tripler Army Medical Center’s NICU in Hawaii—the hospital augmented its capabilities to address the reality that aeromedical evacuations can take up to seven days to coordinate, plus 8-16 hours of flight time.

The impact is significant for military families stationed in Guam. For example, a baby born at 35 weeks of pregnancy who is experiencing respiratory distress can now receive treatment locally rather than requiring immediate medical evacuation. This means some families can remain together on the island during their baby's treatment.

""Our priority is delivering the highest quality care to our service members and their families,"" said U.S. Naval Hospital Guam’s Director Capt. Joel Schofer. ""The NeST program demonstrates our commitment to enhancing our capabilities and ensuring our beneficiaries have access to safe, quality health care when and where they need it.""

Cutting-Edge Technology

The NeST team uses state-of-the-art equipment to provide specialized care to their tiny patients. Their advanced respiratory support system delivers nitric oxide generated from room air to help newborns with persistent pulmonary hypertension, a serious condition affecting oxygen and blood flow to the lungs. They also use specialized breathing equipment that delivers precise, tiny breaths to protect delicate newborn lungs, and an innovative cooling system designed to minimize brain injury in babies who experienced oxygen deprivation during birth.

""These devices allow the team to provide very specialized care that can minimize life-long consequences to the newborn.” Pierce explained. ""The technology helps us deliver the highest level of care possible within our capabilities.""

The team recently achieved a significant milestone when they successfully administered a medication that helps premature babies breathe more easily by coating their tiny lungs with a substance similar to what full-term babies naturally produce. By delivering this medication through a special airway mask—a first for the hospital—they helped a premature baby's lungs work better while avoiding the need for more invasive treatment.

Comprehensive Care Approach

""Staff develop a deep sense of commitment to providing the best care possible with the goal of improving patient outcomes,"" Pierce said. ""Neonatal patients don't have the luxury of choosing the circumstances to which they are born into and every intervention made will affect the rest of that infant’s life.""

The team also provides education and training to other hospital staff, participating in emergency response drills and teaching life-saving resuscitation skills. This commitment to education extends to support departments like radiology, pharmacy, laboratory, and the blood bank, whose staff have enhanced their capabilities to support neonatal patients.

Looking to the Future

With USNH Guam anticipating a potential growth in deliveries by 2033, the evolution of the NeST program ensures military families and other TRICARE-eligible beneficiaries have access to the highest level of care.

""NeST is evolving into what we hope will be a self-sustaining group of NICU-experienced staff who are more permanent to U.S. Naval Hospital Guam,"" Pierce said.

While Pierce is optimistic about the future, she wants expectant mothers to understand the scope of care available to them. The island of Guam does not have an accredited NICU and the naval hospital’s NeST program, while designed to ensure newborns have access to the best care possible until they can be stabilized or transported to a higher level of care, is not a NICU.

""The NeST team is enhancing U.S. Naval Hospital Guam's ability to provide exceptional neonatal care anytime, anywhere—always,"" Pierce said.

All counties are impacted.

To receive an emergency refill of prescription medications, TRICARE beneficiaries should take their prescription bottle to any TRICARE retail network pharmacy. If the bottle is unavailable or the label is damaged or missing, beneficiaries should contact Express Scripts, Inc., or their retail network pharmacy for assistance.

To find a network pharmacy, beneficiaries may call Express Scripts at 1-877-363-1303, or search the network pharmacy locator.

If possible, visit the pharmacy where the prescription was filled. Prescriptions filled by a retail chain may be filled at another store in that chain. If the clinician who prescribed the medication is available, beneficiaries can ask them to call in a new prescription to any network pharmacy.

As a reminder, TRICARE beneficiaries, other than active duty service members, may receive urgent care from any TRICARE-authorized urgent care center or provider and do not need a referral. This allows beneficiaries to seek nonemergency care for illnesses or injuries if their primary care provider is unavailable because of emergencies. Any TRICARE beneficiary who reasonably believes they have an emergency should always call 911 or, go to the nearest emergency room.

Beneficiaries are advised to visit Express Scripts’ Weather Notices page for updates.

Smith, the acting Director of the Defense Health Agency (DHA), raising concerns about ongoing reimbursement failures and their effects on Northeast Florida military families and medical providers.

Over the last several weeks, Congressman Bean has heard from concerned constituents and providers about significant issues with their TRICARE compensation. Despite their efforts to reach out independently to TRICARE, many constituents have not had their issues addressed.

In part, the Northeast Florida lawmakers wrote:

“We have heard from countless concerned constituents that the new T-5 contract has had a severe impact on our military families and community medical providers. Providers across the nation have reported millions of dollars in unpaid or unprocessed claims. TRICARE beneficiaries are experiencing unfathomable delays. This crisis has put smaller practices at risk of shutting down, jeopardizing access to care for thousands of military families across the country.”

The full text of the letter may be found here and below.

Dear Dr. Smith,

We write to express our deep concerns regarding the impact of ongoing TRICARE East reimbursement issues on our military families and community medical providers. Our military families deserve the best possible care and support, and the current state of affairs is unacceptable.

We have heard from countless concerned constituents that the new T-5 contract has had a severe impact on our military families and community medical providers. Providers across the nation have reported millions of dollars in unpaid or unprocessed claims. TRICARE beneficiaries are experiencing unfathomable delays. This crisis has put smaller practices at risk of shutting down, jeopardizing access to care for thousands of military families across the country.

In Northeast Florida, service members and their families are already facing reduced access to medical care. We have heard from mothers pleading for our help to resolve the billing issues to make sure their children do not lose access to physical therapy, behavioral health providers, and surgical services. The most vulnerable are left hanging in the balance as these payment delays continue.

Additionally, we are hearing from providers who serve TRICARE beneficiaries that they are already notifying patients that their services will be greatly reduced or discontinued. For one clinic, TRICARE patients comprise roughly 30% of their total patient population and they are owed around $100,000 for unpaid services. With providers not being reimbursed, small businesses with a heart for serving military and veteran families are at risk of shuttering.

It would be unacceptable for military families to lose access to critical health care coverage. This crisis must be immediately rectified, so that TRICARE payment services are restored, and providers can remain operational. To provide transparency and ensure accountability, we respectfully request answers to the following questions:

When do you anticipate the current reimbursement delays will be resolved?

What steps are you taking to ensure these delays are resolved?

When should providers who have not yet received payment for their services expect to be reimbursed by TRICARE?

How many TRICARE beneficiaries are expected to lose coverage due to a lack of recurring payment information, and what steps are being taken to proactively reach out to them?

What proactive steps are being taken to ensure that we do not face this critical payment issue again in the future?

Thank you for your prompt attention to this urgent matter.

This critical legislation would align the VHA with current Defense Health Agency policy that allows both Certified Registered Nurse Anesthetists (CRNAs) and physician anesthesiologists to be autonomous providers of anesthesia, while strengthening safety and transparency within the VHA.

The VHA has created unnecessary inefficiencies in providing anesthesia care for veterans. Ongoing physician anesthesiologist shortages and an increasing demand of aging veterans who need care mean that cumbersome supervision models are untenable. As CRNAs are trained as autonomous healthcare professionals who increasingly provide a greater share of safe anesthesia care nationwide, removing these barriers to care will benefit both veterans and taxpayers. Specifically, duplication in providing anesthesia care through unnecessary physician anesthesiologist supervision of CRNAs has consistently led to increased costs, longer wait times and delays, and even cancellations of care for veterans.

“As a veteran and practicing CRNA, I am excited to see Representatives Underwood and Kiggans introduce this critical legislation to help our veterans get the prompt care they deserve,” said Jan Setnor, MSN, CRNA, Col. (Ret), USAFR, NC president of American Association of Nurse Anesthesiology (AANA). “For too long Veterans have been denied timely access to care within the VHA due to outdated barriers and red tape that this bill would finally address.”

The failure of VHA’s current anesthesia models was highlighted by reports out of both the Denver Veterans Affairs Medical Center (VAMC) and the Hampton Roads VAMC, where burdensome models led to delays and cancellations of surgeries.

CRNAs are able to practice without the supervision of a physician anesthesiologist in 49 states and the District of Columbia, but the VHA continues to utilize inefficient models that are increasingly detrimental. Multiple independent groups have supported CRNA full practice authority within the VHA, including a recent report commissioned by Temple University.

“This bill brings the first major step towards improving and streamlining veterans’ care and experience through the VHA,” added Setnor. “Allowing CRNAs to practice autonomously, like all other advance practice nurses do within the system, would immediately increase the capacity of the VHA to provide anesthesia care or other airway management skills to Veterans and decrease costs.

However, empathy is currently underrepresented in medical education. Currently, no guidelines exist for integrating empathy training into medical schools or residency programs. The goal of this study was to pilot a workshop for medical students, residents, and fellows designed to enhance functional empathy skills and awareness. The relationship between physician empathy and improved patient outcomes is well-documented in the literature and is not the focus of this manuscript. This study concentrates on the development of new empathy training and its integration into the medical curriculum.

Materials and methods: The participants were medical students, residents, and fellows who rotated through the Walter Reed Pain Clinic. All participants attended a 1-h virtual workshop via an online platform focused on empathy. The workshop was composed of preparatory reading materials, a simulation video, and a case discussion led by three facilitators. This workshop occurred once a month and each rotation included a different set of attendees. A total of 13 monthly seminars were run from May 2023 to August 2024. The impact of this activity was measured with a series of three surveys, which asked learners to directly assess the efficacy of the workshop and to self-evaluate their competencies in key areas. There was a pre-workshop survey to establish a baseline for participants' empathy self-assessments, an immediate post-workshop survey with an aim to measure the perceived quality of the curriculum, and a 1-month check-in designed to measure if the workshop improved participants' self-assessed empathy skills.

Results: The primary outcome was the change in participants' self-assessed empathy 1 month after the workshop. Data from the 1-month follow up demonstrate that there was significant improvement in self-assessments of empathy by learners after the workshop. The secondary outcome was the participant analysis of the workshop curriculum. A total of 94% of participants indicated they would recommend the workshop to their colleagues. In all, 76% of participants indicated they will be changing the way they practice because of the workshop.

Attacks on property carrying the logo of Elon Musk's electric-car company are cropping up across the U.S. and overseas. While no injuries have been reported, Tesla showrooms, vehicle lots, charging stations and privately owned cars have been targeted.

There's been a clear uptick since President Donald Trump took office and empowered Musk to oversee a new Department of Government Efficiency that's slashing government spending. Experts on domestic extremism say it's impossible to know yet if the spate of incidents will balloon into a long-term pattern.

In Trump’s first term, his properties in New York, Washington and elsewhere became a natural place for protest. In the early days of his second term, Tesla is filling that role.

“Tesla is an easy target,” said Randy Blazak, a sociologist who studies political violence. “They’re rolling down our streets. They have dealerships in our neighborhoods.”

Musk critics have organized dozens of peaceful demonstrations at Tesla dealerships and factories across North America and Europe. Some Tesla owners, including a U.S. senator who feuded with Musk, have vowed to sell their vehicles.

But the attacks are keeping law enforcement busy.

Prosecutors in Colorado charged a woman last month in connection with attacks on Tesla dealerships, including Molotov cocktails thrown at vehicles and the words “Nazi cars” spray-painted on a building.

And federal agents in South Carolina last week arrested a man they say set fire to Tesla charging stations near Charleston. An agent from the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives wrote in an affidavit that authorities found writings critical of the government and DOGE in his bedroom and wallet.

“The statement made mention of sending a message based on these beliefs,” the agent wrote.

Some of the most prominent incidents have been reported in left-leaning cities in the Pacific Northwest, like Portland, Oregon, and Seattle, where anti-Trump and anti-Musk sentiment runs high.

An Oregon man faces charges after allegedly throwing several Molotov cocktails at a Tesla store in Salem, then returning another day and shooting out windows. In the Portland suburb of Tigard, more than a dozen bullets were fired at a Tesla showroom last week, damaging vehicles and windows, the second time in a week that the store was targeted.

Four Cybertrucks were set on fire in a Tesla lot in Seattle earlier this month. On Friday, witnesses reported a man poured gasoline on an unoccupied Tesla Model S and started a fire on a Seattle street.

In Las Vegas, several Tesla vehicles were set ablaze early Tuesday outside a Tesla service center where the word “resist” was also painted in red across the building’s front doors. Authorities said at least one person threw Molotov cocktails — crude bombs filled with gasoline or another flammable liquid — and fired several rounds from a weapon into the vehicles.

“Was this terrorism? Was it something else? It certainly has some of the hallmarks that we might think — the writing on the wall, potential political agenda, an act of violence,” Spencer Evans, the special agent in charge of the Las Vegas FBI office, said at a news conference. “None of those factors are lost on us.”

Tesla becomes a target for the left

Tesla was once the darling of the left. Helped to viability by a $465 million federal loan during the Obama administration, the company popularized electric vehicles and proved, despite their early reputation, that they didn’t have to be small, stodgy, underpowered and limited in range.

More recently, though, Musk has allied himself with the right. He bought the social network Twitter, renamed it X and erased restrictions that had infuriated conservatives. He spent an estimated $250 million to boost Trump’s 2024 Republican campaign, becoming by far his biggest benefactor.

Musk continues to run Tesla — as well as X and the rocket manufacturer SpaceX — while also serving as Trump’s adviser.

Tesla stock doubled in value in the weeks after Trump’s election but has since shed all those gains.

Trump gave a boost to the company when he turned the White House driveway into an electric-vehicle showroom. He promoted the vehicles and said he would purchase an $80,000 Model S, eschewing his fierce past criticism of electric vehicles.

Tesla didn't respond to a request for comment. Musk briefly addressed the vandalism Monday during an appearance on Sen. Ted Cruz’s podcast, saying “at least some of it is organized and paid for” by “left-wing organizations in America, funded by left-wing billionaires, essentially.”

“This level of violence is insane and deeply wrong,” Musk wrote Tuesday on X, sharing a video of burning Teslas in Las Vegas. “Tesla just makes electric cars and has done nothing to deserve these evil attacks.”

The progressive group Indivisible, which published a guide for supporters to organize “Musk Or Us” protests around the country, said in a statement that all of its guidance is publicly available and “it explicitly encourages peaceful protest and condemns any acts of violence or vandalism.”

Some Tesla owners have resorted to cheeky bumper stickers to distance themselves from their vehicle’s new stigma and perhaps deter would-be vandals. They say things like “I bought this before we knew Elon was crazy” or “I just wanted an electric car. Sorry guys.”

Prices for used Cybertrucks, Tesla’s most distinctive product, have dropped nearly 8% since Trump took office, according to CarGurus, which aggregates used-car vehicle listings. The market as a whole remained steady over the period.

The White House vows a crackdown

The White House has thrown its weight behind Musk, the highest-profile member of Trump's administration and a key donor to committees promoting Trump's political interests. Trump has said Tesla vandalism amounts to “domestic terror,” and Trump has threatened retribution, warning that those who target the company are “going to go through hell.”

Attorney General Pam Bondi said she’d opened an investigation “to see how is this being funded, who is behind this.”

“If you’re going to touch a Tesla, go to a dealership, do anything, you better watch out because we’re coming after you,” Bondi said Friday on Fox Business Network. In a statement Tuesday, she vowed to “continue investigations that impose severe consequences,” including for “those operating behind the scenes to coordinate and fund these crimes.”

Colin Clarke, a senior research fellow at the Soufan Center, said left-wing political violence tends to target property rather than people. He views the rise of neo-Nazi groups as a bigger security threat at this point.

“It’s not the type of act that I would prioritize,” Clarke said. “Not right now compared to all the other threats that are out there.”

Theresa Ramsdell is the president of the Tesla Owners of Washington state, a club for Tesla enthusiasts, and she and her husband own three of them.

“Hate on Elon and Trump all you want — that’s fine and dandy, it’s your choice,” she said. “It doesn’t justify ruining somebody’s property, vandalizing it, destroying it, setting it on fire. There’s other ways to get your voice heard that’s more effective.”

Someone recently slapped a “no Elon” sticker on the tailgate of her Cybertruck, but she said she doesn’t intend to stop driving her Teslas. Other club members have taken a similar view, she said.",https://media.tegna-media.com/assets/CCT/images/ccbf403b-d60b-4d44-ba14-19a7adc6f1e7/20250319T135235/ccbf403b-d60b-4d44-ba14-19a7adc6f1e7_1140x641.jpg,N,0.0,2025-03-19 16:56:41.377478

Here’s how it works: Employer-sponsored and private insurance: OHI pays first.
TRICARE pays last, after Medicare and OHI, as described in the TRICARE For Life Handbook.
Travel insurance: If you buy a temporary plan for travel, TRICARE will process your claims only after your travel insurance.
You must submit a TRICARE Other Health Insurance Form to Express Scripts.","MARCH 19, 2025 – Do you or your spouse have health coverage through an employer? Or maybe you’ve been shopping for additional coverage due to a change in your health needs.

TRICARE may not be the only health coverage you have. If you have health insurance through an employer, a spouse’s plan, or a private insurer, it’s considered other health insurance.

OHI can affect how TRICARE processes your claim. TRICARE and OHI work together to help cover your health care and services, as described in Chapter 4, Section 1 of the TRICARE Reimbursement Manual.

Understanding how TRICARE coordinates with OHI can help ensure your claims are processed correctly, helping to avoid unexpected costs.

Which insurance pays first?

In most cases, TRICARE pays after your OHI has processed your claim. Here’s how it works:

Employer-sponsored and private insurance: OHI pays first. After your OHI processes the claim, TRICARE may cover some—or all—of the balance.

Medicare, OHI, and TRICARE For Life:

Whether Medicare or your OHI pays first depends on several factors: whether your OHI is based on current or former employment (and the number of employees), and if you have end-stage renal disease. Medicare only coordinates with one other health plan.

If OHI pays after Medicare, and there is a remaining balance, you’re responsible for filing a claim with TRICARE.

TRICARE pays last, after Medicare and OHI, as described in the TRICARE For Life Handbook.

If you have Medicare and have questions about who pays first, or if your coverage changes, call Medicare’s Benefits Coordination and Recovery Center at 855-798-2627 (TTY: 855-797-2627) .

Travel insurance: If you buy a temporary plan for travel, TRICARE will process your claims only after your travel insurance.

There are a few times when TRICARE pays first. This includes when you have:

Medicaid

TRICARE supplemental plans

Eligibility for state victims of crime compensation programs

Other federal government programs identified by the Defense Health Agency

If TRICARE mistakenly pays first when it shouldn’t, it may take back the payment and reprocess your claim after your OHI has processed it.

OHI for active duty service members

Active duty service members can use OHI under certain circumstances. If you use OHI, keep the following in mind:

You’re responsible for all costs.

TRICARE won’t be second payer. There’s no coordination of benefits with your OHI and TRICARE.

You must disclose your military status to your OHI to avoid denials or recoupments.

If you get care from a civilian provider, you must comply with service regulations.

Unauthorized care may affect your fitness for duty status.

What you need to do

To avoid claims processing delays, let your TRICARE contractor and care providers know you have OHI. You can report your OHI by:

Phone: Call your regional TRICARE contractor.

Online: Fill out and submit your contractor’s OHI questionnaire.

Mail or fax: Complete and send your TRICARE contractor OHI questionnaire.

If your OHI coverage changes, notify your TRICARE contractor right away. Losing OHI is a Qualifying Life Event, so you’ll have 90 days to make changes to your plan.

Using OHI with TRICARE pharmacy and dental coverage

Pharmacy benefits: If your OHI includes pharmacy coverage, your OHI will pay first. You must submit a TRICARE Other Health Insurance Form to Express Scripts. For lower costs, use a pharmacy that’s in both your OHI’s network and the TRICARE network.

Dental plans: If you’re enrolled in the TRICARE Dental Program or the Federal Employees Dental and Vision Insurance Program, your dental insurance provider will determine the order of payment based on your plan.

Stay informed and notify TRICARE

Properly coordinating your OHI with TRICARE ensures you maximize your benefits and avoid delays in claims processing. If you have OHI:

Tell your TRICARE contractor and healthcare providers about your OHI.

Make sure your claims are submitted in the correct order.

Notify TRICARE if your OHI coverage changes.

Unlock your health by taking these simple steps today. When everyone is informed and working together, you’ll ensure that your health coverage is maximized.

The recall affects 66 Large Chicken Boxes (84 oz.) and 74 Small Chicken Boxes (21 oz.) with the lot code/best by date of 11152026. The affected products were distributed to retailers in California, Colorado, New York, Pennsylvania and Washington.

New York City health officials this week urged consumers to avoid Savage Pet products because of the cats' illnesses.

One cat fell ill and died this month after eating the Savage Pet products. Final test results are pending, but a preliminary test for H5N1 was “nonnegative,” which indicates that a certain amount of virus was detected, a department spokesperson said.

A second cat was diagnosed with H5N1 and died — and tests suggested it was infected with a strain related to that found in the recalled Savage Pet food. However, that cat did not eat the food; it was exposed to a third cat that fell ill after eating the food from the implicated lot. That cat survived but was not tested.

The recall is the latest in recent months tied to products potentially contaminated with the virus that has sickened and killed cats in several states.

Earlier this month, Wild Coast Raw, of Olympia, Washington, recalled frozen boneless raw chicken cat food after it was linked to illnesses and deaths in cats in Oregon and Washington. In December, Morasch Meats of Portland, Oregon, recalled its Northwest Naturals brand of raw and frozen turkey pet food after it tested positive for the virus and was linked to the death of a local cat.

Health officials advise cat owners to monitor their pets for symptoms including fever, lethargy, low appetite, eye inflammation, discharge, breathing difficulties, and neurological signs such as tremors or seizures. Seek veterinary care immediately if such symptoms appear.

No human infections have been reported from handling raw pet food products, but health authorities warn that humans can become infected if live virus enters the eyes, nose, or mouth. People who have handled the recalled products should watch for symptoms such as eye irritation, cough, sore throat, fever, and respiratory difficulties.

By noon on Tuesday, Nasser Hospital had received the bodies of at least 28 children killed in recent violence, according to records shared by Ahmed Al-Farra, head of pediatrics and obstetrics.
Gaza’s Health Ministry said the strikes killed at least 404 people and wounded more than 560.","DEIR AL-BALAH, Gaza Strip — Israel launched airstrikes across the Gaza Strip early Tuesday that killed more than 400 Palestinians, local health officials said, shattering a ceasefire in place since January as it vowed to force Hamas to release more hostages and relinquish control of the territory.

Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu ordered the strikes after Hamas refused Israeli demands to free half of the remaining hostages as a precondition for extending the ceasefire. Israel’s deadliest bombardment of the territory in the 17-month war killed mostly women and children, according to the Gaza Health Ministry.

Netanyahu said the attack was “only the beginning” and that Israel would press ahead until it achieves all of its war aims — destroying Hamas and freeing all hostages held by the militant group.

Hamas said at least six senior officials were killed in Tuesday’s strikes. Israel said they included the head of Hamas’ civilian government, a justice ministry official and two security agency chiefs.

All further ceasefire negotiations will take place “under fire,” he said in a statement aired on national television. The White House said it had been consulted and voiced support for Israel’s actions.

The Israeli military ordered people to evacuate eastern Gaza and head toward the center of the territory, indicating that Israel could soon launch renewed ground operations. The new campaign comes as aid groups warn supplies are running out two weeks after Israel cut off all food, medicine, fuel and other goods to Gaza’s 2 million Palestinians.

The pre-dawn barrage across Gaza struck homes and shelters and set a tent camp ablaze as families slept or prepared the “sohour,” the meal Muslims eat before they start the daily fast in the holy month of Ramadan. In Gaza City, Omar Greygaa said that after the strikes, he ran out to help survivors in a nearby stricken building.

“In every room I found the dead. ... I finish in one place and go to another, and I find more dead,” he said. “I don't know if we're in a state of war or truce.”

The attack could signal the full resumption of a war that has already killed tens of thousands of Palestinians and caused widespread destruction across Gaza. It also raised concerns about the fate of the roughly two dozen hostages held by Hamas who are believed to still be alive.

A senior Hamas official said Netanyahu’s decision to return to war amounts to a “death sentence” for the remaining hostages. Izzat al-Risheq accused Netanyahu of launching the strikes to save his far-right governing coalition.

There were no reports of any attacks by Hamas several hours after the bombardment.

But Yemen’s Houthi rebels fired rockets toward Israel for the first time since the ceasefire began. The volley set off sirens in Israel’s southern Negev desert but was intercepted before it reached the country’s territory, the military said. The U.S. over the weekend launched deadly strikes against the Iranian-backed Houthis.

Israel’s return to a military campaign came as Netanyahu faces mounting domestic pressure, with mass protests planned over his handling of the hostage crisis and his decision to fire the head of Israel’s internal security agency. His latest testimony in a long-running corruption trial was canceled after the strikes.

The strikes appeared to give Netanyahu a political boost. A far-right party led by Itamar Ben-Gvir that had bolted the government over the ceasefire announced Tuesday it was rejoining.

The main group representing families of the hostages accused the government of “deliberately dismantling” the ceasefire. Thousands of Israelis packed a Tel Aviv square Tuesday evening to protest Netanyahu’s intention to fire the country’s domestic security chief and demand the government to resume negotiations for a hostage deal.

“Today Netanyahu did not open the gates of hell on Hamas. He opened the gates of hell on our loved ones,” said Einav Zangauker, whose son is among the hostages.

After two months of relative calm during the ceasefire, stunned Palestinians found themselves once again digging loved ones out of rubble and holding funeral prayers over the dead at hospital morgues.

“Nobody wants to fight,” Nidal Alzaanin, a resident of Gaza City, said. “Everyone is still suffering from the previous months.”

A hit on a home in Rafah killed 17 members of one family, according to the European Hospital, which received the bodies. The dead included five children, their parents, and another father and his three children. Another in Gaza City killed 27 members of a family, half of them women and children, including a 1-year-old, according to a list of the dead put out by Palestinian medics.

By noon on Tuesday, Nasser Hospital had received the bodies of at least 28 children killed in recent violence, according to records shared by Ahmed Al-Farra, head of pediatrics and obstetrics.

At Khan Younis’s Nasser Hospital, patients lay on the floor, some screaming. A young girl cried as her bloody arm was bandaged. Wounded children overwhelmed the pediatric ward, said Dr Tanya Haj-Hassan, a volunteer with Medical Aid for Palestinians aid group.

She said she helped treat a 6-year-old girl with internal bleeding. When they pulled away her curly hair, they realized shrapnel had also penetrated the left side of her brain, leaving her paralyzed on the right side. She was brought in with no ID, and “we don’t know if her family survived,” Haj-Hassan said.

Gaza’s Health Ministry said the strikes killed at least 404 people and wounded more than 560. Zaher al-Waheidi, head of the ministry’s records department, said at least 263 of those killed were women or children under 18. He described it as the deadliest day in Gaza since the start of the war.

In his statement Tuesday, Netanyahu blamed Hamas for civilian casualties, saying it operates among the population.

The war has killed over 48,500 Palestinians, according to local health officials, and displaced 90% of Gaza’s population. The Health Ministry doesn’t differentiate between civilians and militants but says over half of the dead have been women and children.

The war erupted when Hamas-led militants stormed into southern Israel on Oct 7, 2023, killing some 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and taking 251 hostages. Most have been released in ceasefires or other deals, with Israeli forces rescuing only eight and recovering dozens of bodies.

The White House blamed Hamas for the renewed fighting. National Security Council spokesman Brian Hughes said the militant group “could have released hostages to extend the ceasefire but instead chose refusal and war.”

The ceasefire deal that the U.S. helped broker, however, did not require Hamas to release more hostages to extend the halt in fighting beyond its first phase.

An Israeli official, speaking on condition of anonymity to discuss the unfolding operation, said Israel was striking Hamas’ military, leaders and infrastructure and planned to expand the operation beyond air attacks.

The official accused Hamas of attempting to rebuild and plan new attacks. Hamas militants and security forces quickly returned to the streets in recent weeks after the ceasefire went into effect. Hamas on Tuesday denied planning new attacks.

Under the ceasefire that began in mid-January, Hamas released 25 hostages and the bodies of eight more in exchange for more than 1,700 Palestinian prisoners as agreed in the first phase.

But Israel balked at entering negotiations over a second phase. Under the agreement, phase two was meant to bring the freeing of the remaining 24 living hostages, an end to the war and full Israeli withdrawal from Gaza. Israel says Hamas also holds the remains of 35 captives.

Instead, Israel demanded Hamas release half of the remaining hostages in return for a ceasefire extension and a vague promise to eventually negotiate a lasting truce. Hamas refused, demanding the two sides follow the original deal, which called for the halt in fighting to continue during negotiations over the second phase.

Israel says it will not end the war until it destroys Hamas’ governing and military capabilities and frees all hostages — two goals that could be incompatible.

A full resumption of the war would allow Netanyahu to avoid the tough trade-offs called for in the second phase and the thorny question of who would govern Gaza.",https://media.tegna-media.com/assets/CCT/images/c393859d-1fbf-4225-a3b6-782f2371486e/20250318T112728/c393859d-1fbf-4225-a3b6-782f2371486e_1140x641.jpg,N,0.0,2025-03-19 12:57:01.221766

After a confusing weekend, the Department of Veterans Affairs has confirmed that they will no longer offer treatment for gender dysphoria to veterans who aren’t already receiving gender-affirming care through the department.

It’s been a difficult year for trans service members and their families. One of former president Joe Biden’s final acts in office was to sign a National Defense Authorization Act that denied coverage for gender-affirming care through TRICARE, service members’ primary healthcare insurance provider, the first federally enacted anti-LGBTQ+ law since the 1996 Defense of Marriage Act.

Then, immediately after taking office and during a whirlwind of anti-trans executive orders being issued, Trump declared that transgender Americans would no longer be allowed to serve in the military. Early this month, the Pentagon issued new directives to identify and fire service members who have, or have a history of, gender dysphoria starting next month. The blatantly discriminatory firing of more than 15,000 service members, many of whom likely occupy key positions in the hierarchy of the United States military, will certainly destabilize an armed forces that’s already struggling to meet recruitment quotas.

Whether or not you see that as a silver lining, it’s hard to celebrate more than 15,000 unemployed transgender people. That ban is currently blocked by a federal court order, but it remains to be seen if the Trump administration and the Department of Defense will obey the courts.

Now, after previously denying a change in policy, the VA has confirmed that they will no longer be treating new patients for gender dysphoria. They are rescinding Directive 1341, which provided detailed guidance for the kinds of care veterans can receive at a VA facility, and refusing to provide gender-affirming care for any veterans who aren’t already receiving treatment for gender dysphoria.

VA Secretary Doug Collins said in a press release on Monday, “I mean no disrespect to anyone, but VA should not be focused on helping Veterans attempt to change their sex. The vast majority of Veterans and Americans agree, and that is why this is the right decision … [if] veterans want to attempt to change their sex, they can do so on their own dime.”

This seems especially buffoonish coming from the organization that, need I remind you all, spends tens of millions of dollars annually on dick pills for troops. Not that I have anything against the concept of providing truly gluttonous amounts of Viagra for our fighting men and women… or whatever… but it just seems a tad hypocritical, considering trans troops and veterans cost the government barely a fraction of the money they spend on those dick pills.

The VA assures that non-GAC healthcare for LGBTQ+ veterans won’t be affected by these changes, but that’s cold comfort for the people who sacrificed years of their lives to earn lifetime care from the fed, only to be told now that they can’t be treated for a specific disorder—their doctors told that they cannot practice certain kinds of medicine and provide appropriate treatment to their patients—because of an ongoing culture war between the fascists in power and a minority group that constitutes maybe one percent of the entire national populace. To say nothing of the fact that LGBTQ+ veterans have a higher rate of suicide than the general veteran population, which is already higher than that of the civilian population.

I would advise trans veterans to prepare for the goal posts to be moved even further in the coming days.",http://static1.squarespace.com/static/633303d5ccf756402b93f25c/t/67da4246834e1b4e4537e4f9/1742357062503/va-1024x708.jpg?format=1500w,N,0.0,2025-03-19 06:56:27.296932

As a retired military family who has had personal experience with U.S. Rep. Jen Kiggans’ constituent services, I read with interest the letter of Mr. Charles W. Robinson (“Kiggans fails constituents,” March 12).

We had a serious coverage issue arise involving Tricare (Humana Military) regarding our dependent adult child. We initially went through Tricare in a futile attempt to resolve the issue: an issue where we had recorded evidence they were in the wrong. We were told by their representatives, basically, that they don’t correct these types of errors, sorry, you’re on the hook. This error was going to leave our adult dependent on the hook for over $100,000 in charges. This dependent has a chronic disease and medical expenses add up every year. It looked hopeless.

I then decided to contact Rep. Kiggans’ constituent office to see if there was anything they could do to help us with this federal agency. Her constituent services put in a congressional inquiry to Tricare. It was that congressional inquiry that got the ball rolling. It was a matter of a couple of days that our child had a representative from Tricare assigned to her case to work through the issue. We never received a response to our submitted paperwork via the Tricare system to dispute the charges. It was only due to the work of Rep. Kiggans’ office that anything was done on our behalf.

To say Rep. Kiggans and her staff fail her constituents is disingenuous. Her office saved our family over $100,000 in potential medical bills. Her office came through when, if we’d just stuck with what Tricare was telling us, we’d be looking at paying back a lot of medical debt that was their error.

Regarding the other issues Mr. Robinson brought up in his letter, Rep. Kiggans addresses these issues via her social media. Maybe Mr. Robinson doesn’t follow Rep. Kiggans on the various social media platforms or isn’t signed up for her newsletter.

We are one retired military family that is grateful for Rep. Kiggans and the work her office has done and continues to do on our behalf.

“The experience underscored the critical importance of the hospital's mission within the broader context of Guantanamo Bay,” Ferrara said.
As part of this system, USNH Guantanamo Bay plays a vital role in delivering health care to service members, civilians, and their families stationed at U.S.
Naval Station Guantanamo Bay.","GUANTANAMO BAY, Cuba – Dr. Stephen Ferrara, Acting Assistant Secretary of Defense for Health Affairs, visited U.S. Naval Hospital Guantanamo Bay to engage with leadership and staff on Feb. 27, 2025.

Ferrara’s visit underscores his commitment to engaging with medical personnel at military hospitals and clinics across the Military Health System to better understand their challenges and ensure they have the resources necessary to provide exceptional care.

As the principal advisor to the Secretary of Defense and the Undersecretary of Defense for Personnel and Readiness, Ferrara oversees health policy, programs, and force health protection across the MHS.

“There is no substitute for boots-on-the-ground to understand the nature and complexity of any mission, especially one this complex,” Ferrara said. “I wanted to ensure the team was receiving the support they need to execute their mission successfully. U.S. Naval Hospital Guantanamo is a particularly vital military hospital in a remote location with a unique mission set, so seeing both the daily operations and unique operations like the joint expeditionary MEDEVAC training was invaluable for understanding the hospital's specific needs and how I can best support their critical work from my position. As the Acting Assistant Secretary of Defense for Health Affairs, I have a unique responsibility for detainee care, making it important that I gain a firsthand understanding of that unique mission.”

Managing a geographically remote military hospital comes with challenges in manning and occasionally supply chain procurement. Hospital Director U.S. Navy Capt. Tammy Servies, who also serves as commanding officer for U.S. Navy Medicine Readiness and Training Command and commander of Joint Task Force Guantanamo’s Joint Medical Group, doesn’t let that impede the mission with her focus on a ready medical force and a medically ready force.

“We were very excited to welcome Dr. Ferrara to Guantanamo,” Servies said. “We provide care to a diverse community, including service members, their dependents, government civilian employees, contractors, and foreign national workers. It was very gratifying to show Dr. Ferrara that no matter who walks through our doors, we are committed to delivering high-quality, reliable health care. Our mission is rooted in operational readiness and wellness, ensuring that those we serve receive the best possible care.

“The health, wellness, and readiness of every service member I lead as the CO of USNMRTC Guantanamo, matters to me personally,” Servies continued. “My team cannot adequately care for others if they are not healthy themselves.”

During his visit, Ferrara met with a cross-section of sailors from every department within the hospital to speak with them and listen to what matters to the most junior members of the hospital team.

“The dedication and resilience of the entire medical staff left a lasting impression on me,” Ferrara said. “It's one thing to hear about the demands of operating in a remote location, but witnessing the team's unwavering commitment to providing top-notch care across a range of disparate environments was truly inspiring.”

Servies echoed the significance of Ferrara’s visit, emphasizing the impact of leadership engagement in understanding the realities of providing health care in a remote setting.

“Despite the challenges we face, my team never fails to amaze me with their willingness to take on every mission that comes our way,” Servies said. “Whether providing support to Joint Task Force Guantanamo, Joint Task Force Southern Guard, or managing the daily operations and patient load from our local community, these military and civilian personnel show an indomitable spirit and mental toughness that sometimes leaves me in awe.”

Ferrara’s visit highlights the ongoing efforts to strengthen military health care delivery and support the dedicated medical personnel who stand ready to serve whenever and wherever they are needed.

“The experience underscored the critical importance of the hospital's mission within the broader context of Guantanamo Bay,” Ferrara said. “The team's ability to maintain a constant state of readiness, adapt to diverse needs, and seamlessly collaborate with other units is a testament to their professionalism and commitment to excellence. The isolation of Guantanamo Bay is also easy to underestimate until walking the spaces. The team here has a mission like no other in the Military Health System.”

The Defense Health Agency manages military hospitals and clinics across the Department of Defense, integrating health care services to enhance readiness, improve patient outcomes, and streamline medical operations.

How to prepare for going to the dentist

Prepare a list of questions. Before your appointment, prepare a list of questions. Ask about preventive measures specific to your needs, like the best flossing technique for your teeth or the ideal frequency of cleanings based on your risk factors.

Don’t hesitate to ask questions. During your appointment, ask clarifying questions about procedures if you’re feeling unsure, discuss the pros and cons of different treatment options, and inquire about potential risks and side effects. If a procedure is suggested, ask about alternative methods, the cost associated with each, and whether your insurance covers the procedure.

Be clear and direct. At any time during the appointment, be clear and direct in expressing any discomfort or concerns. Don't suffer in silence. If a procedure is painful or uncomfortable, inform your dentist immediately. They can adjust their technique or provide pain relief.

Use active listening. Make sure you understand what your dentist is saying about your diagnosis, treatment plan, and aftercare instructions. You can repeat the information back to your dentist to ensure you’ve understood correctly.",https://media.defense.gov/2025/Mar/18/2003669042/1920/1080/0/250318-O-D0202-1001.JPG,N,1.0,2025-03-18 16:56:32.090496

Clarkson opened up the episode with a ""Kellyoke,"" where she sang ""Flames"" by New Zealand artist Will Swenson. Soon after wrapping the song, the music star jumped right into interviewing ""Severance"" actor Adam Scott.

The 42-year-old singer did not publicly address her absence from the show's past several episodes. Reports surfaced last week that the ""American Idol"" winner was fine herself but was ""dealing with a personal matter.""

When everyone is informed and working together, you’ll ensure that your health coverage is maximized.","FALLS CHURCH, Va. – Do you or your spouse have health coverage through an employer? Or maybe you’ve been shopping for additional coverage due to a change in your health needs.

TRICARE may not be the only health coverage you have. If you have health insurance through an employer, a spouse’s plan, or a private insurer, it’s considered other health insurance.

OHI can affect how TRICARE processes your claim. TRICARE and OHI work together to help cover your health care and services, as described in Chapter 4, Section 1 of the TRICARE Reimbursement Manual.

Understanding how TRICARE coordinates with OHI can help ensure your claims are processed correctly, helping to avoid unexpected costs.

Which insurance pays first?

In most cases, TRICARE pays after your OHI has processed your claim. Here’s how it works:

• Employer-sponsored and private insurance: OHI pays first. After your OHI processes the claim, TRICARE may cover some—or all—of the balance.

• Medicare, OHI, and TRICARE For Life:

• Whether Medicare or your OHI pays first depends on several factors: whether your OHI is based on current or former employment (and the number of employees), and if you have end-stage renal disease. Medicare only coordinates with one other health plan.

• If OHI pays after Medicare, and there is a remaining balance, you’re responsible for filing a claim with TRICARE.

• TRICARE pays last, after Medicare and OHI, as described in the TRICARE For Life Handbook.

• If you have Medicare and have questions about who pays first, or if your coverage changes, call Medicare’s Benefits Coordination and Recovery Center at 855-798-2627 (TTY: 855-797-2627) .

• Travel insurance: If you buy a temporary plan for travel, TRICARE will process your claims only after your travel insurance.

There are a few times when TRICARE pays first. This includes when you have:

• Medicaid

• TRICARE supplemental plans

• Eligibility for state victims of crime compensation programs

• Other federal government programs identified by the Defense Health Agency

If TRICARE mistakenly pays first when it shouldn’t, it may take back the payment and reprocess your claim after your OHI has processed it.

OHI for active duty service members

Active duty service members can use OHI under certain circumstances. If you use OHI, keep the following in mind:

• You’re responsible for all costs.

• TRICARE won’t be second payer. There’s no coordination of benefits with your OHI and TRICARE.

• You must disclose your military status to your OHI to avoid denials or recoupments.

• If you get care from a civilian provider, you must comply with service regulations.

• Unauthorized care may affect your fitness for duty status.

What you need to do

To avoid claims processing delays, let your TRICARE contractor and care providers know you have OHI. You can report your OHI by:

• Phone: Call your regional TRICARE contractor.

• Online: Fill out and submit your contractor’s OHI questionnaire.

• Mail or fax: Complete and send your TRICARE contractor OHI questionnaire.

If your OHI coverage changes, notify your TRICARE contractor right away. Losing OHI is a Qualifying Life Event, so you’ll have 90 days to make changes to your plan.

Using OHI with TRICARE pharmacy and dental coverage

• Pharmacy benefits: If your OHI includes pharmacy coverage, your OHI will pay first. You must submit a TRICARE Other Health Insurance Form to Express Scripts. For lower costs, use a pharmacy that’s in both your OHI’s network and the TRICARE network.

• Dental plans: If you’re enrolled in the TRICARE Dental Program or the Federal Employees Dental and Vision Insurance Program, your dental insurance provider will determine the order of payment based on your plan.

Stay informed and notify TRICARE

Properly coordinating your OHI with TRICARE ensures you maximize your benefits and avoid delays in claims processing. If you have OHI:

• Tell your TRICARE contractor and healthcare providers about your OHI.

• Make sure your claims are submitted in the correct order.

• Notify TRICARE if your OHI coverage changes.

Unlock your health by taking these simple steps today. When everyone is informed and working together, you’ll ensure that your health coverage is maximized.
