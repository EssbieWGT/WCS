Charles Marcello Buono, 45, was taken into custody on Tuesday following an investigation by the Walton County Sheriff’s Office. The case began when a local college professor reported that one of their students had disclosed being abused. Campus police then notified sheriff’s investigators.

According to the Sheriff’s Office, the victim provided a detailed statement and recordings that corroborated her account. When confronted with evidence, Buono initially denied the allegations but later admitted to being depicted in one of the videos investigators presented to him.

Buono was arrested without incident and charged with lewd and lascivious molestation by an offender 24 years or older on a victim 16 or 17 years of age. His bond was set at $100,000, and he remains in custody as of Wednesday.

“What happened here is nothing short of evil,” Sheriff Michael Adkinson said in a statement. “Crimes like this shake our sense of humanity, and we will not rest until justice is served.”

The Walton County School District suspended Buono immediately after his arrest and has begun termination proceedings. He also worked for the Defense Health Agency as a Department of Defense contractor, the Sheriff’s Office confirmed.

Authorities emphasized that the charges are unrelated to Buono’s duties as a bus driver and that there is no indication the victim was a student on his route. However, investigators have not ruled out the possibility of other victims and are encouraging anyone with information to come forward.

“This investigation remains ongoing,” the release stated, “and additional charges may be forthcoming.”",https://midbaynews.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/BUS-DRIVER-ARRESTED-ON-ABUSE-CHARGES.png,N,0.0,2025-10-15 18:01:18.707409

By combining their innovation with our federal market expertise, we’re making it easier for clinicians to access tools that enhance preventive care and protect our Veterans’ long-term health.”

— Chris Lovell, CEO of Lovell Government Services.

PENSACOLA, FL, UNITED STATES, October 15, 2025 /EINPresswire.com/ -- Lovell® Government Services and The Electrode Store, a leader in developing accessible, technology-driven electrodiagnostic solutions for better health outcomes, announced today that they have partnered to serve federal healthcare systems such as the Veterans Health Administration (VHA), the Military Health System (MHS), and the Indian Health Service (IHS). Lovell Government Services will serve as The Electrode Store’s Service-Disabled Veteran-Owned Small Business (SDVOSB) vendor to serve these customers through federal contracting systems.

The Electrode Store’s newest product, DPNCheck 2.0 (model NC-040), is a handheld, point-of-care device that delivers quantitative sural nerve conduction measurements in just 30–60 seconds. Unlike subjective methods such as monofilament testing, DPNCheck provides objective, reproducible data to detect peripheral neuropathy early, often before symptoms become clinically evident. Supported by optional Reporter software for detailed reporting and data archiving, DPNCheck empowers clinicians across care settings to make faster, more informed decisions that protect mobility, reduce complications, and improve long-term patient outcomes.

As DPNCheck’s SDVOSB Vendor, Lovell is excited to bring this product to federal healthcare providers. DPNCheck is now available the Department of Veterans Affairs’ Federal Supply Schedule (FSS), GSA Advantage, the Defense Logistics Agency’s Electronic Catalog (ECAT), and the Department of Defense’s Distribution and Pricing Agreement (DAPA). By listing products on contract vehicles with Lovell streamlines the acquisition process while helping government agencies meet their SDVOSB procurement goals.

“We’re proud to partner with The Electrode Store to bring the DPNCheck 2.0 to federal healthcare systems,” said Chris Lovell, Major, USMC (Ret.), CEO of Lovell Government Services. “By combining their innovation with our federal market expertise, we’re making it easier for VA and DoD clinicians to access tools that enhance preventive care and protect our Veterans’ long-term health.”

“Our nation’s Veterans deserve the very best in preventive care, and neuropathy is too often overlooked until it has already caused serious complications,"" said Steve Obey, CEO of The Electrode Store. ""By partnering with Lovell, we can put accurate, early detection tools directly into the hands of VA and DoD clinicians, helping them to protect mobility, reduce pain, and improve long-term quality of life for those who have served.""

Craig J. Bryan, Psy.D., from The Ohio State University in Columbus, and colleagues examined the efficacy of BCBT for reducing suicide attempts and suicidal ideation among high-risk military personnel and veterans in a two-arm parallel randomized clinical trial.

Participants were randomly assigned to BCBT, a psychotherapy that teaches emotional regulation skills or present-centered therapy (PCT), a problem-solving psychotherapy. A total of 108 individuals were enrolled.

The researchers found that fewer patients receiving BCBT than PCT attempted suicide during follow-up (estimated proportion, 5.6 versus 27.9 percent). The mean time to first suicide attempt was 638.6 versus 755.9 days in the PCT versus BCBT groups.

BCBT should be a recommended treatment for preventing suicide attempts and disseminated throughout the military health system.

There was a significant reduction in the risk for any suicide attempt (hazard ratio, 0.25) and in the rate of follow-up suicide attempts (0.06 versus 0.18 attempts per participant-year; risk ratio, 0.24) with BCBT. In both groups, suicidal ideation decreased significantly, with no between-group differences noted.

“BCBT should be a recommended treatment for preventing suicide attempts and disseminated throughout the military health system,” the authors write.

However, if you receive medical services on or after October 1, 2025, your claims may not be processed or paid until funding returns.

An official TRICARE statement notes, ""TRICARE may not process or pay medical claims for services received on or after October 1, 2025, until funding is restored.""

DHA says pharmacy services, network care, and other TRICARE functions continue but could be affected if the shutdown persists. TriWest, managing the TRICARE West Region, also warns of possible payment delays until funding resumes.

What’s Still Working (For Now)

Military Treatment Facilities remain open. TRICARE Pharmacy services are available, though hours or support could change with staffing or funding issues.

Both network and non-network civilian providers still offer care. Emergency services are not affected.

What’s at Risk for Military Families

If you see a civilian provider after October 1, claims may not be processed until the government reopens. Families could face reimbursement delays or may need to pay upfront. Some civilian clinics, reliant on TRICARE payments, already ask for payment before appointments or delay non-urgent visits.

When funding returns, TRICARE will process a backlog of claims, referrals, and authorizations. Recovery may take weeks or months. Small and specialty clinics, especially those for children, behavioral health, or physical therapy, may struggle financially during payment delays.

Pharmacies are open, but prolonged shutdowns could delay refills or prescription verification if contractor staff are furloughed.

What You Can Do Right Now

Step 1: Track and note your care dates to identify which appointments could be impacted based on whether they occurred before or after October 1. This will help you determine which claims might be delayed.

Step 2: Ask your healthcare provider whether payment will be required at the appointment or if services might be delayed until funding resumes. Confirm their payment and scheduling policies in advance.

Step 3: Keep all your Explanation of Benefits, receipts, and authorization documents organized to ensure smooth reimbursement processing when claims resume. Have these materials ready to submit if needed.

Step 4: Check the TRICARE Shutdown Information Page regularly to receive the most current updates and alerts that may affect your care or claims.

Step 5: If your provider will not file claims or is unsure how to proceed, contact your regional TRICARE contractor (Humana Military for the East, TriWest for the West) to get guidance and resolve questions.

Step 6: Proactively set aside extra funds so you are prepared to cover any temporary out-of-pocket medical expenses if payment is needed up front during the shutdown.

The Big Picture & What Comes Next

The government shutdown began on October 1, 2025, after Congress did not pass new spending bills. While mandatory programs such as Social Security continue, much of the Defense Health Agency’s operations depend on annual appropriations.

Active-duty service members, retirees, and families still receive care, but civilian claims processing may pause until lawmakers act. The longer the shutdown lasts, the broader the impact across clinics, pharmacies, and family finances.

“Our goal is to minimize disruption,” the Defense Health Agency emphasized, “but TRICARE services may be affected by a prolonged lapse.”

In the end, the shutdown’s effect on TRICARE is not just about funding. It also affects the health and readiness of every military household.

Once Congress restores funding, TRICARE contractors will resume full operations. Families should expect a backlog and longer processing times as the system catches up.

Stay proactive, keep records organized, and talk with healthcare providers. TRICARE is the core of military healthcare, but a shutdown can challenge even strong systems.

It is part of a breakthrough ceasefire after two years of war between Israel and Hamas in the devastated Gaza Strip.

U.S. President Donald Trump is in the region to discuss the U.S.-proposed deal and postwar plans with other leaders.
A surge of humanitarian aid was expected into famine-stricken Gaza, where hundreds of thousands of people have been left homeless.","President Trump directs DoD to ensure funds are available to pay troops during shutdown, Hamas releases all 20 prisoners, and Tricare warns that shutdown could impact payments.

1. President Donald Trump said Saturday that he has directed the Defense Department to use “all available funds” to ensure U.S. troops are paid Wednesday despite the government shutdown, a short-term fix that will not apply to the hundreds of thousands of federal workers who have been furloughed. Trump said in a social media post that he was acting because “our Brave Troops will miss the paychecks they are rightfully due on October 15th.” The president’s directive removes one of the pressure points that could have forced Congress into action, likely ensuring that the shutdown — now in its 11th day and counting — extends into a third week and possibly beyond. But no similar action seems forthcoming for federal employees also working without pay while thousands are now being laid off during the lapse in government operations. The White House budget office started the layoffs on Friday.

2. Hamas released all 20 of the last living hostages on Monday, the Israeli military said. It is part of a breakthrough ceasefire after two years of war between Israel and Hamas in the devastated Gaza Strip. Buses carrying dozens of freed Palestinian prisoners drove to the West Bank city of Ramallah and the Gaza Strip, the Hamas-run Prisoners Office said. Israel is freeing more than 1,900 prisoners as part of the ceasefire deal. U.S. President Donald Trump is in the region to discuss the U.S.-proposed deal and postwar plans with other leaders. A surge of humanitarian aid was expected into famine-stricken Gaza, where hundreds of thousands of people have been left homeless. While major questions remain about the future of Hamas and Gaza, the exchange of hostages and prisoners marked a key step toward ending the deadliest war ever between Israel and the militant group.

3. President Donald Trump on Sunday warned Russia that he may send Ukraine long-range Tomahawk missiles if Moscow doesn’t settle its war there soon — suggesting that he could be ready to increase the pressure on Vladimir Putin’s government using a key weapons system. “I might say, ’Look: if this war is not going to get settled, I’m going to send them Tomahawks,” Trump told reporters aboard Air Force One as he flew to Israel. “The Tomahawk is an incredible weapon, very offensive weapon. And honestly, Russia does not need that.” Trump also said, “I might tell them that if the war is not settled -- that we may very well.” He added, “We may not, but we may do it. I think it’s appropriate to bring up.” His comments came after Trump spoke with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, and Trump said he mentioned possibly sending Tomahawks during that conversation.

4. As the federal government shutdown continues, some Tricare medical providers are being told their claims for services for military families may not be paid until government funding is restored, according to contractors, advocates and the Tricare.mil website. It’s not clear why those claims are delayed or why the money isn’t available now to pay claims for that care, as the Defense Department’s shutdown guidance specifically exempts private-sector care under Tricare from the shutdown’s effects. “You can’t tell providers to keep seeing people free of charge,” said Kristi Cabiao, CEO and founder of Mission Alpha Advocacy, an organization that works to improve quality of life for military families with special needs. “I thought this was an entitlement. I’m really concerned for our families.”",https://www.legion.org/assets/dist/images/favicons/favicon-32x32.png,N,0.0,2025-10-13 11:56:43.481722

Sanchez, 38, is facing multiple charges, including felony battery, for his altercation with 69-year-old Perry Tole, in which Sanchez was stabbed multiple times. Tole claimed he was defending himself from the former NFL star. Sanchez was released from jail following his booking Sunday.

Sanchez told reporters that he is recovering slowly and that “it is a long process.”

Tole has sued Sanchez and Fox Sports for his injuries that he said he received in the Oct. 4 incident in Indianapolis.

Though the shutdown officially began Oct. 1, outside funds from donations and endowments allowed a brief extension. Now, its administrators said, the Smithsonian complex must cease public operations until a budget deal.

The closures affect what had been one of the most accessible forms of public education and sightseeing in the United States With 21 museums, 14 research centers and the National Zoo, the Smithsonian is the largest museum and research network in the world.

The absence of open museums cast a palpable gloom over the capital. Though the weekend brought rainy weather that may have suppressed tourism anyway, the lack of activity around the National Mall left the area unusually quiet.

Washington’s reputation as a destination for cultural visitors has long been tied to its museums, and their closure underscores how dependent the city is on federal operations and how vulnerable that model becomes in shutdowns.

Moreover, many district residents work at various Smithsonian complexes, and the shutdown means a majority of Smithsonian staff members have been furloughed. Some essential operations, like at the National Zoo, must continue for animal care, using existing reserves.

The 163-acre public zoo is home to more than 2,200 animals. The private Conservation Biology Institute is in Front Royal Va., 73 miles away. The two employ in total more than 300 staff members and scientists.

For residents and tourists, the museums and zoo had been a “free of cost” option for learning and cultural engagement.

Most of its museums cluster along or near the National Mall, with several other in the D.C. metro area and two facilities in New York City — also closed because of the shutdown.

The portfolio includes institutions devoted to natural history, air and space, African American history and culture, American art and many specialized fields.

In addition to public galleries and exhibitions, the Smithsonian operates research and education centers. These focus on areas like the cnservation Institute, tropical research Institute and conservation biology.",https://media.breitbart.com/media/2025/10/wi/upi/smithsonian-closes-museums-zoo-government-shutdown-smithsonian-closes-museums-zoo-government.jpg,N,0.0,2025-10-13 11:56:48.861444

Stop playing politics for your beloved illegal aliens and PUT OUR MILITARY FAMILIES FIRST!🔵🔵🔵 As the Schumer @senschumer shutdown moves through its second week, health care providers are not being compensated for services provided to military service members and their families. Some doctors and health care providers in San Antonio who rely on TRICARE to pay for services provided to military members and dependents say they are now starting to feel the pinch.

The Democrats’ stated priority of extending federal subsidies related to Obamacare coverage may now be endangering the health care services for United States military service members, retirees, and their dependents. Although the financial hardships facing medical providers who rely on TRICARE are of nationwide concern, the issue is perhaps more visible in San Antonio, often referred to as “Military City USA” due to the number of Department of War installations located within the city.

San Antonio is home to Joint Base San Antonio, the U.S. military’s largest joint base operation that includes Lackland Air Force Base, Randolph Air Force Base, Fort Sam Houston, and Camp Bullis. Soldiers and Airmen assigned to the bases and their families rely on TRICARE to reimburse civilian health care providers who are now feeling the financial impact of the shutdown. Military retirees also rely on TRICARE insurance for healthcare needs.

In a recent San Antonio News4SA report, one health care provider servicing families with children with developmental disorders was already struggling to stay open. Dr. Britt Sims, Executive Director of Integrated Behavior Solutions, told News4SA, “We can last a couple of weeks on what I have personally, but now, I’m done. I’m spent. If by some miracle, something happens, then I don’t know. We’ll keep fighting somehow.”"".",Not Available,https://scontent-iad3-2.cdninstagram.com/v/t51.82787-15/563888927_18412480666116778_6754570071581282722_n.jpg?stp=c275.0.827.826a_dst-jpg_e35_s640x640_tt6&_nc_cat=105&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=18de74&efg=eyJlZmdfdGFnIjoiRkVFRC5iZXN0X2ltYWdlX3VybGdlbi5DMyJ9&_nc_ohc=RiB_XiUw01AQ7kNvwELfbbR&_nc_oc=Adm70aFHISLAC-lUWB35eYma2mzxhPwEKy4T9K8X0_M5yCtozSVG3YNW65lL4zbzpxE&_nc_zt=23&_nc_ht=scontent-iad3-2.cdninstagram.com&_nc_gid=AE6QEg_FelWLykkL2gV8KQ&oh=00_Afcr2LWiGNvGcJpoGGfNBYtD7D0GWzeCMIjBiPB_id2pYg&oe=68F20733,N,1.0,2025-10-12 18:56:17.921714
