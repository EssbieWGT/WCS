In the middle of unpacking boxes and switching to a new TRICARE region, there’s barely time to catch your breath — let alone monitor every unfamiliar phone call or credit card charge.

Maybe you’ve stopped screening calls like you used to or maybe you’ve let autopay handle your finances this month. It’s easy to miss a red flag — or worse, engage with something you shouldn’t.

That’s exactly how scammers slip through the cracks.

Anyone who grew up alongside the evolution of dial-up to Starlink knows better than to wire money to a whining Nigerian prince, but scammers have evolved far beyond those early internet cons.

Tactics have become more sophisticated, and phone and email filters are constantly playing catch-up. With caller ID spoofing and AI-generated messages, it’s getting harder to tell what’s real and what’s a scam.

Phishing emails are the most common entry point for identity theft in the world, according to the Cybersecurity & Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA). These messages are crafted to look official, complete with logos, familiar language, and links that closely mimic legitimate websites.

Military personnel were even the target of a scam that the Federal Trade Commission flagged in 2023. In this scheme, fraudsters pose as representatives from the Defense Finance and Accounting Service (DFAS), claiming there’s a problem with your pay and pressuring you to confirm personal information or send money through third-party apps. The FTC and most financial institutions emphasize: they’ll never call out of the blue or request payment through apps like Zelle or PayPal. What sounds like a routine customer service message might actually be a red flag.

How to protect yourself

Fortunately, staying safe from identity theft doesn’t require a degree in cybersecurity — just a healthy dose of skepticism and a willingness to second-guess anything that feels off.

Secure your devices and logins: Use multi-factor authentication on accounts like MyPay, TRICARE, and VA. Avoid public Wi-Fi for anything sensitive unless you have a VPN (your TAD hotel lobby isn’t the place to check your bank balance). And yes, those software update pop-ups matter. Keep your antivirus protection and operating system up to date.

Monitor your financial accounts: Make it a habit to scan your bank and credit card statements regularly. Set up transaction alerts so you know if something weird pops up. Some third-party identity monitoring services, like LifeLock, can notify you anytime your social security number is used in an application for a new account. This can help you catch fraud before it snowballs. And if something does seem off? Fortunately, your bank and the major credit bureaus have systems in place to help, especially when caught early.

Be skeptical of unfamiliar contacts: Scammers count on you being too busy (or too polite) to second-guess a sketchy message. Don’t click links in unsolicited texts or emails, no matter how official they seem. If someone calls claiming you have an overdue tax bill or a warrant out for your arrest, hang up and call back using the organization’s publicly listed number. If it’s legit, they’ll understand. If it’s not, enjoy the relief of having dodged a scam.

Use resources designed for military families: Free active-duty credit monitoring is available, and you can check your credit report annually at annualcreditreport.com. DFAS also offers guidance on their website; this one is worth bookmarking before you actually need it.

If you think your information has been compromised, act fast. Report suspicious activity to your bank and credit card company immediately. File a report with the FTC on their website, and place a credit freeze or fraud alert with the three major credit bureaus.

Unfortunately, protecting yourself from identity theft isn’t a one-and-done task. It takes ongoing awareness. So, stay alert, ask questions, and trust your gut. But also know that you can contact your base legal office or Military OneSource for guidance and support.",https://militaryfamilies.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/shutterstock_2189791535-scaled.jpg,N,0.0,2025-09-22 10:56:23.236269

From extreme weather changes to limited communications and infrastructure, the Arctic poses unique challenges for troops and medical personnel. Senior leaders and health experts agree that medical and operational readiness is vital in the region as its strategic importance grows.

Why the Arctic matters

The Arctic spans three continents and encompasses eight nations, seven of which are NATO members. New trade routes have opened in the region — enabling faster global shipping and easier access to untapped resources. It can be described as a region of extremes: extreme cold, extreme seasonal changes in daylight, extreme winds, and extreme terrain.

For the U.S. military, an Arctic presence secures national defense, maritime access, and humanitarian support, while also addressing environmental concerns, said U.S. military medical experts.

Medical operations in Arctic environments were topics at two major Military Health System conferences this year, in April at the 2025 MHS Annual Conference and in August at the 2025 MHS Research Symposium.

“While the Arctic was once envisioned as a neutral zone where research and conservation could promote deeper international cooperation, multiple developments since then have turned it into a site of competition,” said Air Force Col Gabriel DiNofrio, Deputy Command Surgeon, U.S. Northern Command, during the 2025 MHS Conference.

Medical care in the extreme cold

Operating in the Arctic pushes medical systems and equipment to their limits. Cold affects every aspect of care, from supplies to personnel.

“When everything freezes — blood, tubing, and medical machines — how do you provide medical care in this environment?” asked Army Col. Manuel Menéndez, Special Operations Forces North Command surgeon, at the 2025 MHS Conference. Most medical equipment is not designed for extreme cold. Batteries drain quickly, plastics become brittle, adhesives don’t stick, and medications can freeze before use.

“Plastics freeze and snap. Fluids will flash-freeze,” said Marine Capt. Jeffrey Feinberg, Marine Forces Europe Africa command surgeon. “For all those super great things we have, the batteries are going to last a fraction of the time.”

Andres Martinez Murillo, a biomedical engineer at Naval Medical Research Unit - San Antonio, stressed the importance of reliable gear and equipment at the 2025 MHS Research Symposium. “It is important to know that our medical equipment works in these Arctic conditions. Storage and the materials used to make these materials need to improve to withstand the extreme cold.”

His team at NAMRU-SA is studying the effects of cold weather on military equipment and developing solutions. They discovered that commonly used medical items, such as stethoscopes and medical tubing, crack in extreme cold weather.

Exposure injuries can rise sharply in the Arctic. Hypothermia and frostbite can appear within minutes, and half of frostbite cases never fully recover. “Even mild hypothermia triples the risk of death after injury.” Feinberg said.

Lack of familiarity

One of the biggest challenges for U.S. troops, according to Feinberg, is inexperience with Arctic conditions.

“We are not used to cold climates. We don’t have a lot of people who can inherently look at that and go, those are the wrong shoes,” Feinberg said. “When we first take a force up there, they don’t know what right looks like.”

Menéndez agreed, “You have to be out there. You have to experience the environment, and then you learn a lot of lessons.”

DiNofrio highlighted three key readiness focus areas: “Understanding what is required physically, how to move people and equipment without freezing, and how to provide medical care in this environment.”

The critical role of gear

The first line of defense is what service members wear. Layered clothing, insulated boots, and protective gloves are essential.

“Every time you don’t have to take your gloves off to do something, that’s a personal win,” said Jeffrey B. Phillips, a senior research scientist at the Florida Institute for Human & Machine Cognition, said at MHS Research Symposium. “Gloves that allow dexterity while preserving heat can mean the difference between staying effective or suffering frostbite.”

Boots must resist moisture and allow movement in snow and ice. Service members also depend on insulated layers that trap body heat without restricting motion. When combined, this gear forms personal heat protection that allows survival long enough to fight, move, and provide care.

The military is also implementing cold-weather gear in exercise drills. Menéndez discussed the success of experiments at a 2025 training exercise, including the use of nanofibers on socks and gloves to assess insulation and the use of biosensors on operators to monitor heart rate, body temperature, and exertion.

Training and readiness

To close gaps in training and mission readiness, U.S. forces are relying on realistic exercises that mimic Arctic conditions.

Special Operations Command North has piloted a program, Special Operations Forces Arctic Medic, that teaches service members how to stay warm, move patients, and deliver care without leaving thermal or electronic signatures. Lessons include skiing during storms to avoid detection, carrying blood inside clothing to prevent freezing, and creating “heat bubbles” to protect patients, according to Menéndez.

In one exercise, medics performed real surgery on perfused cadavers aboard a moving train in Alaska, guided in real time by surgeons at Brooke Army Medical Center in Texas. The test showed how augmented reality and satellite communications can bridge gaps in expertise far from hospitals.

Mental readiness also matters — extended periods of darkness, isolation, and extreme cold can strain morale. Several speakers at the conferences emphasized buddy checks, nutrition, and realistic expectations to help service members adjust to their new environment.

Working with international partners vital to mission success

International collaboration is critical in the Arctic, spanning multiple nations. Evacuations often require patient transfers across agencies and allies.

Exercises such as Arctic Edge, the Norwegian military-led Cold Response, and Joint Viking allow U.S. forces to train alongside allies in Norway, Sweden, Finland, and Canada.

“If you can’t hand a patient from SEALS to Special Forces to the Coast Guard to the Air Force without changing out tubing, you’re not going to succeed,” said Menéndez.

Feinberg noted that allies are eager to train together, to collaborate, and to become familiar with their backyard.

For the U.S. military, learning how to adapt to the Arctic is a mission readiness requirement — and staying fit to fight is imperative when cold weather can be the biggest threat. “The environment is trying to kill both of us: us and the enemy,” said Menéndez, “but if I can move faster … further than the enemy … I win.”",https://d1ldvf68ux039x.cloudfront.net/thumbs/photos/2502/8892007/1000w_q95.jpg,N,0.0,2025-09-22 10:56:28.182273

WASHINGTON, Sept. 22, 2025 /PRNewswire/ -- The National Coalition for Access to Autism Services (NCAAS) today hailed the release of the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine's comprehensive report confirming what military families, autism care providers, and advocates have long argued: Applied Behavior Analysis (ABA) is a medically necessary service for many autistic individuals and should be treated as a standard benefit by TRICARE, the military services' healthcare program for active-duty service members and veterans.

The 336-page congressionally mandated study, The Comprehensive Autism Care Demonstration: Solutions for Military Families, rejects the Department of Defense's prior conclusions about ABA and calls on TRICARE to recognize ABA as a core benefit for military families.

""This report is a watershed moment for our military families,"" said Mike Moran, chairman of NCAAS. ""The National Academies recommended that the Department of Defense should discontinue its current autism care program and authorize coverage of applied behavior analysis—a primary and highly personalized therapeutic approach to autism—as a basic benefit under the TRICARE program, including moving the ABA billing program off the No Government Pay List.""

TRICARE is an outlier. While nearly all commercial and self-funded employer plans, Medicaid, CHIP, FEHBP, and CHAMPVA cover ABA, TRICARE still treats it as a temporary demonstration. The National Academies study not only identifies ABA as a standard of care to address autism, but it recommends that ABA services be available to address maladaptive behaviors and activities of daily living affecting the health and well-being of children with autism, including:

Removal of current restrictions that do not allow medically necessary ABA services in schools and other community settings for purposes of targeting behaviors and skills outside the home.

Allowing reimbursement for higher staff-to-client ratios and crisis intervention procedures were deemed necessary by the ABA provider.

NCAAS first became concerned in 2018 about the Department of Defense's reports to Congress questioning the efficacy of the Department's Autism Care Demonstration, which were predicated on conclusions drawn from the DoD's incorrect use of a widely used assessment tool and TRICARE's misuse of patient data in the Autism Care Demonstration—conclusions that have been invalidated by the National Academies report. NCAAS raised these concerns with Pentagon officials and the Congressional Armed Services Committees, which led to Congress directing National Academies to undertake the independent analysis that it issued this month.

""For years, military families were told that the Defense Health Agency's data showed ABA was ineffective. The National Academies found those conclusions were based on misused measures that could never capture children's real progress,"" said Julie Kornack, an NCAAS board member. ""Now we have the definitive word: the problem was not ABA, but the way TRICARE measured it. Military families deserve better, and this report makes clear the system must change.""

Together, the APs provide wireless coverage spanning more than 500,000 square feet, ensuring seamless connectivity throughout Kenner’s footprint.
“The new wireless access points will provide better performance, boosted security, and better redundancy while moving about the clinics,” said Mr. John Carter, Chief Information Officer and day shift lead.
In addition, the team installed 60 new network switches across Kenner’s facilities and 29 Uninterruptible Power Supplies (UPS) in all communications closets to maintain network stability during power outages.
With the upgrades complete, Kenner Army Health Clinic has significantly enhanced its digital backbone, supporting both mission-critical operations and daily patient care with reliable, high-speed connectivity.","Patients, staff, and visitors at Kenner Army Health Clinic can now expect stronger wireless connections and improved network reliability thanks to a sweeping upgrade completed across the main clinic and all outlying buildings.

The project included the installation of 188 Aruba wireless access points (APs), each covering an average of 2,500 to 3,500 square feet. Together, the APs provide wireless coverage spanning more than 500,000 square feet, ensuring seamless connectivity throughout Kenner’s footprint.

“The new wireless access points will provide better performance, boosted security, and better redundancy while moving about the clinics,” said Mr. John Carter, Chief Information Officer and day shift lead. “They also allow us to connect our personal devices to the DHA Guest wireless.”

To support the expanded system, the Network team re-wired every communications closet and added 47 additional lines and data drops where needed. More than 10,000 feet of CAT 6 ethernet cable—nearly two miles—were laid during the project.

In addition, the team installed 60 new network switches across Kenner’s facilities and 29 Uninterruptible Power Supplies (UPS) in all communications closets to maintain network stability during power outages. The extensive effort required round-the-clock work, with day shifts managed by Carter and Mr. Timothy Hurd, and night shifts led by Mr. Michael Losoya and Mr. James Corbin.

Project Contributors

The success of this large-scale project was made possible by the collaboration and expertise of the following team members:

• Mr. Rodney Fontenette (Network NE&S) • Mr. Trevor James (Network Administrator) • Mr. Charles Toms (Senior System Administrator) • Mr. James Gammon (System Administrator) • Mr. Timothy Holcey (System Administrator) • Mr. Keoua Foust (Project Manager) • Mr. James Corbin (Night shift lead/Genesis Trainer) • Mr. Michael Losoya (Night shift lead/D.CIO) • Mr. Timothy Hurd (Day shift lead/ISSM-ISSO) • Mr. John Carter (Day shift lead/CIO)

Before installation, the Defense Health Agency’s WLAN team conducted a “heat mapping” of the clinic—walking each space with specialized equipment to pinpoint signal weak spots and guide the placement of access points.

The Mission Within the Mission Raising a neurodivergent child in the military isn’t about fixing them.","Some 36 hours into a cross-country PCS, a seven-year-old autistic military child declared, mid-interstate meltdown, that he was “never speaking to another base housing office again.” It was his fourth move in five years, and he was done with it all.

Meanwhile, his mother juggled Waze directions, a spilled Capri Sun, and a Bluetooth call with the gaining base’s EFMP coordinator. The family dog barked nonstop. Her spouse was somewhere behind them in convoy formation. In the midst of the chaos, she had an epiphany: this wasn’t just another move.

This was going to be one of those chapters, the ones where resilience stops being a mantra reiterated ad nauseam and starts being actual survival.

When Military Life Complicates Neurodivergence

In civilian life, stability serves as an anchor for neurodivergent children. In military life, stability is a pipe dream, one routinely overruled by mission requirements.

Each new base means a new school, a new search for therapy services (if they exist at all), a fresh diagnostic process, and a familiar refrain: “We’re not taking new patients right now.”

It’s like the movie Groundhog Day, but with more paperwork and less personal growth.

Individualized Education Programs (IEP) rarely transfer smoothly. Applied Behavior Analysis therapy has waitlists longer than some deployments. And ever-looming is the fear that this PCS will be the one where a child falls through the cracks.

EFMP: Exceptional, Frustrating, Mostly Paperwork

The Exceptional Family Member Program (EFMP) is designed to help families with unique medical or educational needs. And sometimes, it does.

It’s the reason one family didn’t get sent OCONUS. It’s also the reason they’ve filled out the same dozen forms in triplicate every year since diagnosis.

There are standout EFMP coordinators, heroes who deserve medals and raises. But the program’s effectiveness often depends on local execution, and not every base is equipped (or wholly motivated) to support neurodiversity well.

Still, a flagged assignment is better than the alternative: being stationed somewhere without adequate services and watching a child regress while the system shrugs its shoulders.

What Actually Helps

Resources like Military OneSource, grassroots Facebook groups, and that one eager parent who shows up at the playground with spreadsheets are invaluable tools.

Read: The field guide to finding the ‘seasoned milspouse’ in the wild

There are organizations designed to help. Autism Speaks will provide resources, including their Military Families and Autism Advocacy program. While Operation Autism was launched to provide a resource guide, one complete with information specifically for military families with autistic children.

Support can come from unexpected places: pediatricians who understand sensory needs, virtual OT sessions from licensed providers across state lines, even a chaplain who learned to sign “stim” to connect with a child on base.

However, it goes even deeper. Organizations like Partners in PROMISE are advocating for systemic change in how EFMP operates. The ARC’s Center for Future Planning offers tailored guidance for military families navigating long-term care. Base-level support services, such as School Liaison Officers (SLOs), Family Advocacy Programs, and installation-specific EFMP case managers, can be game changers when families know how to access them.

Tricare’sAutism Care Demonstration (ACD) covers autism services, including Applied Behavior Analysis, occupational therapy, physical therapy, speech therapy, counseling, and even respite care. Their expanded telehealth coverage has been a blessing in remote duty stations, especially for families in rural or overseas locations. And for those facing relocation, STOMP (Specialized Training of Military Parents) offers trainings that demystify IEPs, 504s, and procedural safeguards.

The help exists. But finding it often takes persistence, networking, and a bit of luck. Sometimes it requires an e-tool; other times, a backhoe might be necessary.

The Mission Within the Mission

Raising a neurodivergent child in the military isn’t about fixing them. It’s about creating a sense of stability—a foundation that can adapt with each PCS, each deployment, and each EFMP update.

The victories are small but strong: a grocery run without a meltdown equals a win. A teacher who proactively uses visual aids is a godsend. A command team that treats neurodivergent families as assets, not admin burdens, is a family.

There are no parades. But there is strength, not in spite of the chaos, but forged like coal into a diamond; the pressure is what defines and creates hardiness.

For families searching for “autism services near Fort Wherever,” know this: you’re not alone. There are groups of those who walk the same miles in the same shoes out there. And they’ve got your six.",https://www.wearethemighty.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/neurodivergent-child-EFMP.jpg,N,1.0,2025-09-21 14:56:36.637799

Now a congressional committee is also calling for changes to benefits for people living with autism.

A new study shows the old way of coverage isn't working.

Families could be near the end of their battle for effective healthcare coverage. The Defense Health Agency (DHA) could soon make changes to the way some military families get autism therapy services they need.

""There were a lot of hoops to jump through,"" said military spouse Rebecca Brown.

Her 6-year-old daughter is autistic and needs Applied Behavioral Analysis (ABA). It's a type of therapy specifically tailored to her needs; right now, it's not the easiest to get enrolled in.

""In the Autism Care Demonstration (ACD), there are different assessments that we're required to complete -- both the families and the ABA therapy providers,"" Brown said.

The ACD program has been around since 2014. Brown said she's faced struggles since learning of her daughter's diagnosis.

""Every three months I was spending, no joke, about eight hours on the computer going through each of these and there wasn't any change in the services that my daughter received based on the outcomes of those tests,"" Brown said.

""Autism care services have really evolved over the last 10 years. We need to evolve and be dynamic along with it,"" said Eric Flake, an developmental behavioral pediatrician.

In 2023, Congress called for recommendations on how to better serve military families with an autism diagnosis as part of the National Defense Authorization act. The National Academy of Science published those recommendations this month, Eric Flake was on the committee commissioned by the DHA to write them.

""One of the things that we did recognize is that there is enough evidence at this time to now move it from a demonstration to a basic benefit,"" Flake said. ""We think that that's a timely recommendation.""

That means, instead of going through the 'hoops' Rebecca described, families can get a referral from a doctor and go straight to an ABA specialist. In the report, the committee said the ACD ""lags behind current clinical science and best practices"", calling for ABA to becoming a basic Tricare benefit.

RELATED |

""The requirement to do all these extra things when we know that we need access to this service was just a huge barrier for families like mine,"" Brown said.

Now, congress has a decision to make.

""We are hopeful and excited that the Defense Health Agency, that nonprofit organizations, that congress who asked us to put this together will look at the recommendations and act,"" Flake said.

""This panel, that DoD commissioned themselves, has given them the results that it is effective,"" Brown said. ""It should be covered..we should get that change done, and -- done quickly.""

We reached out to the DHA for comment about those recommendations. Their team sent us a statement saying they're carefully reviewing the entire report to determine their way forward with the ACD program. Until they finish their review, DHA will keep their services under the ACD program.

We'll keep you updated in their final decision.

Judicial Watch Sues FBI for Communications with Anti-Trump Organization

Judicial Watch is still actively working to reveal the anti-Trump lawfare shenanigans of the Biden Justice Department and FBI.

We filed a Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) lawsuit against the U.S. Department of Justice for communications between former Assistant Special Agent in Charge Timothy Thibault and the anti-Trump organization American Oversight (Judicial Watch Inc. v. U.S. Department of Justice (No. 1:25-cv–02556)).

Judicial Watch sued in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia after the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) failed to respond to a January 31, 2025, FOIA request for:

Records and communications between Timothy Thibault, former [Assistant Special Agent in Charge, Washington Field Office] and the non-profit organization American Oversight, 1030 15th St. NW, B255, Washington, D.C. 20005, email domain: @americanoversight. The search terms for this request are a) Trump b) Electors c) Investigation d) election

In July 2022, U.S. Senator Chuck Grassley (R-IA) reportedly warned then-Attorney General Merrick Garland that Thibault and an official in the Justice Department’s Public Integrity Section, Richard Pilger, were “deeply involved in the decisions to open and pursue election-related investigations against President Trump. At the time, whistleblowers told Grassley that the Thibault-Pilger investigation’s predicating document was based on information from ‘liberal nonprofit American Oversight.’” Thibault retired in August 2022.

Earlier this year, Senators Grassley and Ron Johnson (R-WI) publicized records dating back to 2022 about Thibault’s targeting of Trump:

Internal FBI emails and predicating documents provided to Grassley and released jointly by the two senators show Timothy Thibault, a former FBI Assistant Special Agent in Charge (ASAC) who was forced to retire from the Bureau after Grassley exposed his public anti-Trump bias, authored the initial language for what ultimately became Jack Smith’s federal case against Trump regarding the 2020 presidential election. Records show Thibault essentially opened and approved his own investigation.

American Oversight describes itself as “founded in 2017 in response to the unprecedented challenges that the Trump administration posed to our nation’s democratic ideals and institutions.…” Earlier this year, Politico described it as, “A left-leaning watchdog group … working to gather materials that could feed Congressional investigations into the Trump administration.”

It’s a shame that we must sue to get these records about how the Biden gang at the FBI and DOJ tried to rig an election by jailing Trump for disputing the 2020 election. It’s past time for these institutions to focus on transparency under law, so the American people can know the full truth of the lawfare attack perpetrated on Trump.

We have actively pursued transparency for the lawfare waged against Trump.

In June 2025, we launched a related lawsuit against the Justice Department for records about the FBI’s investigation of Trump codenamed “Arctic Frost,” which was part of the Biden administration effort to prosecute and jail President Trump for disputing Biden’s controversial election victory (Judicial Watch, Inc. v. U.S. Department of Justice (No. 1:25-cv-02011)).

In March 2025, we sued the Justice Department for details of any investigations, inquiries, or referrals concerning potential misconduct of any person working for Special Counsel Jack Smith (Judicial Watch Inc. v U.S. Department of Justice (No. 1:25-cv-00801)).

Also in March, Georgia District Attorney Fani Willis was ordered to turn over 212 pages of records to a state court judge. The court also ordered Willis to detail how the records were found and the reason for withholding them from the public. The records were belatedly disclosed in response to a Judicial Watch request and lawsuit for communications with Special Counsel Jack Smith and the House January 6 Committee. In January, we were awarded $21,578 for “attorney’s fees and costs” incurred in the case. The court previously found Willis in default and stated: “The Court finds Defendant [Willis, in her official capacity] is in default and has been since 11 April 2024”(Judicial Watch Inc. v. Fani Willis et al. (No. 24-CV-002805)).

In January 2025, a federal court ordered the Justice Department to provide us information on communications between Special Counsel Jack Smith and Willis regarding the prosecution of then-former President Donald Trump. In May, the Justice Department was directed to search text messages from the Special Counsel’s Office for responsive records (Judicial Watch v U.S. Department of Justice (No. 23-cv-03110).

In January 2025, records from the U.S. Department of Homeland Security (DHS) showed it and the FBI warning that law enforcement agencies should be prepared for a surge in threats from so-called Domestic Violence Extremists (DVEs) following the August 8, 2022, FBI raid on Trump’s Mar-a-Lago estate in Palm Beach, Florida (Judicial Watch Inc. v U.S. Department of Homeland Security (1:22-cv-03275)).

In May 2024, we uncovered a recording of a phone message left by an FBI special agent for someone at the Secret Service in the context of the raid on Trump’s Mar-a-Lago home (Judicial Watch Inc. v. U.S Department of Homeland Security (No. 1:22-cv-03147)).

In February 2024, the Justice Department asked a federal court to allow the agency to keep secret the names of top staffers working in Special Counsel Jack Smith’s office that was targeting Trump and other Americans (Judicial Watch Inc. v U.S. Department of Justice (No. 1:23-cv-01485)).

In August 2022, we successfully sued to unseal the search warrant affidavit used to justify the unprecedented raid on Trump’s home (U.S. v. Sealed Search Warrant (No. 9:22-mj-08332)).

Judicial Watch Sues Justice Department for Communications on Biden-Hur Audio, Epstein Memo

The American public deserves to know the details surrounding the leaks of “exclusive” U.S. Department of Justice information on the Biden-Hur interviews and the Epstein client list memo.

Judicial Watch filed a Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) lawsuit against the Justice Department for its communication with the media outlet Axios regarding the outlet’s “exclusives” on the release of audio of then-President Joe Biden’s August 2023 interview with then-Special Counsel Robert Hur regarding Biden’s handling of secret documents and the July 2025 memo that states there is no Jeffrey Epstein “client list” (Judicial Watch Inc. v. U.S. Department of Justice (No. 1:25-cv-03225)).

We sued the Justice Department after it failed to comply with two FOIA requests. In May 2025, we filed a FOIA request for the Justice Department’s contacts with Axios regarding the Biden-Hur audio recordings. We also had submitted a July 2025 FOIA request for the Justice Department’s communications with Axios pertaining to the investigation of Jeffrey Epstein.

We have been at the forefront of these investigations.

Regarding the Biden-Hur records, in March 2024, we filed the first FOIA lawsuit and were the lead plaintiff asking for the Special Counsel’s interviews of Biden (Judicial Watch, Inc. v. U.S. Department of Justice (No. 1:24-cv-00700)). In June 2024, the Justice Department admitted that the Special Counsel’s transcript was inaccurate.

Justice Department emails in a related case showed White House staffers suggesting edits to transcripts of Biden’s interview with Hur (Judicial Watch v. U.S. Department of Justice (No. 1:24-cv-02176)).

In May 2025, we forced the release of the audio recordings of Biden’s October 2023 interview with Hur. The recordings are available here: justice.gov/storage/Biden-interview-with-Hur-part-1-October-8th.mp3 and justice.gov/storage/Biden-interview-with-Hur-part-2-October-9th.mp3. In July 2025, we reached a settlement in which the government agreed to pay $10,000 for attorneys’ fees and other costs associated with the successful lawsuit that forced release of the audio tapes of Biden’s interview with Hur.

Regarding Jeffrey Epstein, in April 2025, we filed a FOIA lawsuit against the Justice Department for records on the identities of clients or associates of Epstein (Judicial Watch Inc. v. U.S. Department of Justice (No. 1:25-cv-01056)). In July, the Justice Department reported to the court that it was continuing to search for and review records, which is at odds with the leaked, unsigned and undated Justice Department/FBI memo that suggested no more Epstein records would be disclosed to the American public. The memo was first disclosed late on July 6.

We also sued in July for records related to Epstein’s victim Virginia Louise Giuffre.

Hundreds More Illegal Alien Gang Members, Murderers Arrested in Houston

Every town in America is now a border town, but Texas is at the frontier and facing some of the worst consequences of the Biden era’s open-door policy for illegal aliens. Our Corruption Chronicles blog reports.

Texas’s largest city appears to be a cesspool of undocumented criminals where just weeks after federal authorities announced the arrest of hundreds of violent gang members with a combined 1,700 criminal convictions, another 822 illegal immigrant offenders have been apprehended. This batch also includes gangbangers, convicted murderers, child predators, and other egregious criminals. In the last few weeks, during two separate operations, Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) revealed that it has taken more than 1,000 dangerous criminal aliens off the streets in Houston, Texas’s biggest city—and the nation’s fourth largest—with a population of around 2.4 million. The perpetrators rounded up in the first operation completed in early August entered the United States illegally a combined 1,400 times under the Biden administration’s disastrous open border policies that welcomed a record-breaking 7.6 million illegal aliens, including hundreds of thousands with serious criminal records and over 1.7 million from countries the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) says pose a national security threat to the U.S.

In an effort to mitigate the damage the Trump administration launched a nationwide initiative known as Operation Take Back America that aims to repel the invasion of illegal immigration and protect American communities from perpetrators of violent crimes. Cracking down on criminal aliens released throughout the nation under Biden is a key component of the effort and the administration assures it is targeting the “worst of the worst,” for arrest and removal even as most media outlets spin the narrative to focus exclusively on polices open border groups claim separate immigrant families and victimize hard-working migrants. The mainstream media ignored last month’s announcement involving ICE’s Houston operation even though it nabbed hundreds of illegal immigrants who are mostly members of violent gangs, including the renowned Mara Salvatrucha (MS-13), Tren de Aragua, Latin Kings, 15th Street Gang, Sureños, Paisas and Tango Blast and the majority of the perpetrators have been convicted of serious crimes such as homicide, sex trafficking, domestic violence, burglary, arson and unlawful possession of a firearm. The feds made it incredibly easy to report the story by providing mug shots and detailed criminal information of the worst offenders, illustrating the urgency to enforce immigration laws after four years of devastating open border policies.

As expected, the most recent Houston operation has also been disregarded by the media though it was just as alarming. In only a week ICE Enforcement and Removal Operations (ERO) arrested over 800 criminal aliens, many of them transnational gang members, with disturbing records. More than 320 of the offenders had previously been deported from the U.S. and 112 illegally reentered the country at least once after getting deported. “During the past four years, transnational gang members, foreign fugitives and other violent criminal aliens took advantage of the crisis at our southern border to illegally enter the country,” said Houston’s ICE ERO Director Gabriel Martinez in a statement issued by the agency a few days ago. “Many of them remained in the Houston area and have gone on to wreak havoc in our local communities.” Martinez added that the most recent weeklong operation focused on targeting those threats to public safety and resulted in the arrest of 822 illegal aliens, including five transnational gang members, seven child predators and three criminal aliens convicted of homicide-related offenses.

Here are a few examples of the criminal aliens arrested recently in Houston: Jorge Eliseo Torres-Soto, a 30-year-old child predator from Guatemala convicted of sexual assault of a child; William Alexander Telles Amaya, a 35-year-old from El Salvador convicted three times of child sex offenses, including aggravated sexual assault of a child, failure to register as a sex offender and sexual indecency with a minor; Cruz Leandro Martinez Leiva, a 25-year-old from El Salvador and MS-13 gang member convicted of robbery and armed carjacking; Carlos Vega-Ramirez, a 38-year-old Mexican deported from the U.S. twice and convicted of sexual indecency with a minor, enticement of a minor for indecent purposes, driving while intoxicated, fleeing police and forgery; Manuel Ivan Castillo Estrada, a 36-year-old child predator from Mexico deported from the U.S. three times and convicted of alien smuggling and sexually assaulting a minor; Francisco Eduardo Bonilla, a 37-year-old from El Salvador, convicted of sexual indecency with a minor; Alejandro Perez Miramontes, a 54-year-old Mexican deported from the U.S. 12 times and convicted eight times of illegal reentry and twice each of robbery, larceny and burglary as well as trespassing and evading arrest.

Defense Department Being Sued to Restore Kids’ Transgender Treatments

Three military families are suing the U.S. Department of Defense to reverse a provision in the 2024 National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA), signed by former President Biden, which bans Tricare from covering hormone therapy and puberty blockers for transgender minor children of service members. Our Corruption Chronicles blog explains:

Although the Defense Authorization Act signed by former President Biden blocks the U.S. Military’s healthcare system from providing specialized treatments to the transgender children of service members, three families are suing the Department of Defense (DOD) to reinstate the benefit, claiming they have been left with “significant”and “crushing out-of-pocket costs.” Leftist groups were outraged when the measure passed late last year andcalled on Biden to veto it because it bans the military’s Tricare Health Plan from covering gender-affirming care such as hormone therapy and puberty-suppressants to treat “gender dysphoria.” An analysis cited by the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU), a leader in the campaign opposing the military’s transgender healthcare ban, estimates that 2,500 minor patients receive care for gender dysphoria through Tricare and 900 get puberty-suppressants or gender-affirming hormones.

In their lawsuit against the DOD, military personnel with transgender children claim that Tricare’s sudden refusal to cover medically necessary care has inflicted profound harm and that plaintiffs’ families now face significant and crushing out-of-pocket costs. “This is not an abstract policy shift – it is an immediate and devastating disruption of essential health care that affects the physical and psychological well-being of plaintiffs and other young people throughout the country,” according to the complaint filed this month by two LGBTQ+ rights groups on behalf of the families. The transgender patients are not named to protect their privacy and are identified in the complaint as Diana Doe, Nathan Noe, and Parker Poe. The first two were taking hormones prescribed at Walter Reed National Military Medical Center in Maryland and were recently told by doctors that the treatments would no longer be covered under Tricare. The third plaintiff, Poe, is identified in the lawsuit as a young adult who has been taking testosterone covered by Tricare at an unnamed medical facility. Without Tricare coverage the testosterone prescription is “too expensive to purchase out-of-pocket,” the complaint states, adding that the “process has resulted in unnecessary stress and panic.”

Servicemembers and their families have been able to obtain puberty blockers or cross-sex hormone therapy for their transgender children through the military insurance for nearly a decade, one of the LGBTQ+ groups that filed the lawsuit writes in a statement that blames President Trump for ordering the DOD to terminate the essential care. “As a result of the Trump administration’s directive, the families’ trusted doctors cannot provide ongoing care and families are unfairly forced to take on this financial burden,” according to the group, which accuses the Trump administration of waging a relentless assault on transgender Americans and issuing a barrage of discriminatory executive orders designed to strip away their basic legal rights and deny them recognition. The reality is that the defense bill signed by Biden back in December 2024 bans gender-affirming care for transgender youth whose parents are active-duty military personnel. Leftist groups like the ACLU mounted a campaign to pressure Biden to veto the bill, but he signed it even though it prohibits insurance coverage for “medical interventions for the treatment of gender dysphoria,” including the hormone therapy and puberty-suppressants taken by the minors in this lawsuit.

Tricare has never covered the costly transgender sex change operations for adults but until recently provided hormone therapy and psychological counseling for gender dysphoria, which is identified by the plan as “psychological distress that results from an incongruence between one’s sex assigned at birth and one’s gender identity.” Before Trump’s second presidency, Tricare allowed active-duty service members to request a waiver for “medically necessary gender affirming surgery,” but the pricey operation was typically denied and two enlisted men who identify as women sued the DOD claiming the policy discriminates based on sex and transgender status. Less than a year ago, an Obama-appointed federal judge ruled in their favor, determining that the military’s health insurance plan is discriminatory and violates Equal Protection rights under the Fifth Amendment of the United States Constitution by failing to pay for gender transition surgeries, which the judge compared to mastectomies and hysterectomies due to cancer.

Renaissance Ranch, a ""Best in State"" family-owned provider, opens a faith-based treatment center in St. George, addressing men’s substance abuse and mental health struggles.

(PRUnderground) September 19th, 2025

Renaissance Ranch, a family-owned organization dedicated to addiction recovery, has opened a new residential substance abuse and mental health treatment facility for men in St. George, Utah. The Ranch is known for its award-winning, faith-based addiction recovery programs with inpatient and outpatient centers throughout Utah and Idaho.

The new St. George drug rehab offers detox, residential treatment, outpatient treatment, and sober living. Understanding that no two addictions are the same, the Ranch starts treatment with a consultation and builds a customized plan for each client. Participants move through the highly successful 12-step program and receive intensive individual and group counseling to address the issues at the root of their addiction. Graduates of the program can enjoy the lifetime support of the Ranch’s Band of Brothers, which is one of the country’s largest addiction recovery alumni programs for men.

The Ranch believes family involvement is the key to successful addiction recovery, so they also offer an addiction education program for family members, which includes webinars, classes, and family counseling.

The Ranch’s new St. George residential facility expands the organization’s footprint in Utah, complementing its existing outpatient program in the same city. The new faith-based treatment center reflects Renaissance Ranch’s commitment to meeting the growing demand for comprehensive addiction treatment services in southern Utah.

“Utah is a beautiful, family-friendly state with a deep commitment to religion, but it also has a significant substance abuse problem — and too many addictions go untreated. We are committed to cutting through the stigma surrounding addiction and helping individuals and families get the help they need. We are excited to be part of the solution through our beautiful new residential treatment center in St. George,” said Preston Dixon, COO of Renaissance Ranch.

Dixon is no stranger to addiction — he and his brother Tyson, who serves as CEO of the Ranch, both became addicted to drugs as teenagers. After addiction treatment centers transformed their lives, they, along with their parents, purchased the original Renaissance Ranch facility in Bluffdale, Utah, and dedicated themselves to helping others overcome the effects of addiction.

Renaissance Ranch has received Utah’s “Best of State” award for its addiction recovery centers. It accepts most insurances, including Tricare and Medicaid.

Yet today, many military families face frequent relocations and deployments that can disrupt services and jeopardize long-term outcomes for autistic children.

A new independent review by the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering and Medicine recognizes these gaps and provides strong recommendations to make TRICARE more responsive, less burdensome and better aligned with best practices for the autism community.

For over a decade, the Department of Defense (DoD) has offered autism therapy only through the temporary Comprehensive Autism Care Demonstration (ACD). During this time, applied behavior analysis (ABA), a well-established, evidence-based therapy, has been added as a basic health benefit to almost all other health care plans. However, TRICARE continues to exclude ABA as a permanent benefit, and instead has added barriers to accessing this therapy under ACD. While more than 35,000 beneficiaries rely on this program for ABA, families face uncertainty about its future, additional red tape and restrictions that limit access to proven care.

“The disruptions we experienced in receiving ABA services were extremely detrimental to my daughters’ ability to progress with their treatment goals and reduction in self-injurious behaviors,” shared Jennifer Penhale, Air Force spouse and mother to three children with autism. “Our family served the country with the promise from DoD that the most medically fragile and vulnerable of our military community would be taken care of, and we feel that promise has been broken.”

To improve care for TRICARE beneficiaries, the new report recommends that the DHA:

Cover ABA as a basic TRICARE benefit.

Eliminate requiring assessment tools and stress indices that add burden on families without improving care.

Give providers and families flexibility to tailor interventions to individual needs.

Align coverage with current standards of care and industry guidelines.

Establish an independent advisory council—including family members, providers and experts—to guide implementation and monitor delivery of ABA services.

Military families, providers and advocacy organizations like Autism Speaks have for years been raising concerns and advocating for TRICARE to cover ABA as a basic health care benefit.
