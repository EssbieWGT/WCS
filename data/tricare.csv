This is a catch-all term so you might hear it used by providers to describe services, but it is also often used to describe state-run programs.
Early Intervention is available in every US state and territory.
Everyone is eligible to apply for early intervention services.

This is a catch-all term so you might hear it used by providers to describe services, but it is also often used to describe state-run programs. Early Intervention is available in every US state and territory. These publicly funded programs provide services for free or at reduced cost for any child who is eligible.

Everyone is eligible to apply for early intervention services. The state-run program will perform an evaluation of your child’s skills and abilities to see what services they qualify for.

If you, your child’s doctor, or other care provider is concerned about your child’s development, ask to be connected with the local brand of your state’s early intervention program to find out if your child can get services to help. If your doctor is not able to connect you, you can reach out yourself. A doctor’s referral is not necessary.

Unfortunately, this process might take a while. You should expect to have to wait for the evaluation (possibly several weeks). Many early intervention programs have a waitlist because they don’t have enough staff to meet demand for services. However, if your child does qualify, you’ll be assigned a case manager who should help you navigate the program. This case manager will help you get started with services as soon as possible.

Janey Macey and Associates, a pediatric therapy clinic in Bossier City, faces serious operational challenges due to significant TRICARE payment delays. The clinic, which has provided services to military families for over twenty years, is at risk as they have not received payments for the first four months of 2025. Medical providers across Shreveport report similar issues, resulting in financial strain. Meanwhile, a federal grand jury has charged individuals in a bank fraud scheme, highlighting ongoing challenges for military families in the region.

Bossier City, Louisiana – A local pediatric therapy clinic, Janey Macey and Associates, is facing significant challenges due to delayed insurance payments from TRICARE. The clinic has served military families for over twenty years, specializing in behavioral therapy for children with autism. However, TRICARE has not processed any payments to the clinic in the first four months of 2025, putting its operations at risk.

Previously, Janey Macey and Associates could expect payments from TRICARE within two to three days after claims submission. The disruption in payments is attributed to Louisiana’s transition from the TRICARE East region to TRICARE West, which is managed by the TriWest Healthcare Alliance. Providers across Shreveport and the surrounding areas are reporting similar issues, with some clinics forced to close down or lay off staff due to the financial strain.

TriWest Healthcare Alliance has acknowledged the ongoing issues and has committed to processing outstanding claims. In an effort to improve operations, they are increasing staffing at their customer service center. The reaction from the clinics has been mixed, but after being featured in a KTBS interview regarding the payment delays, Janey Macey received its first payment of the year from TRICARE.

Aside from the complications faced by the pediatric therapy clinic, a separate legal issue has arisen in the Bossier City area. A federal grand jury in the Western District of Louisiana has charged twenty-one individuals in a bank fraud scheme targeting major institutions like USAA Bank, Chase Bank, and Navy Federal. The alleged conspiracy resulted in nearly $7 million being stolen through fraudulent activities from January 2021 to October 2022.

The scheme involved acquiring personal account information from employees of a call center and producing counterfeit checks. Co-conspirators primarily targeted older bank customers, who were less likely to monitor their accounts regularly. The fraudulent activities came to light due to numerous checks bouncing, prompting an investigation that involved multiple law enforcement agencies, including the FBI and the Secret Service.

The U.S. Attorney for the district highlighted the importance of safeguarding personal information to combat instances of fraud. As these investigations unfold, awareness of protection against identity theft is increasingly relevant, especially for vulnerable populations.

Additionally, a legislative change affecting military personnel has led to confusion regarding the financing of Guaranteed Asset Protection (GAP) insurance. A recent interpretation of the Military Lending Act has prohibited the financing of GAP insurance, a product that can be beneficial to service members. This change poses new financial challenges for military families who total their vehicles, as they are still able to purchase this coverage outright but cannot finance it alongside their car loans.

These developments underscore the complexities and challenges facing military families in the region, both in terms of healthcare access and financial products. The pediatric therapy clinic’s situation reveals the critical need for reliable insurance processing, while the bank fraud case highlights ongoing issues of consumer protection and financial security.

In conclusion, the Bossier City pediatric therapy clinic and military families face significant hurdles as TRICARE payment delays threaten essential services. Meanwhile, a high-profile bank fraud case adds further strain to the community. Addressing these challenges will require concerted efforts from various stakeholders, including healthcare providers, insurance administrators, lawmakers, and community organizations.

But the following groups are at increased risk for complications: Children younger than age 5 Adults older than age 20 Pregnant women People with weakened immune systems Recognizing measles signs and symptoms Measles symptoms usually appear between seven and 14 days after infection.
The measles, mumps, and rubella, or MMR, vaccine protects against measles as well as mumps and rubella.","JULY 12, 2025 – You may have heard about the ongoing measles outbreak in the U.S. As of July 8, there have been 1,288 confirmed cases in 2025, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. While most of these cases are in Texas, cases have been rising across the country.

Anyone who isn’t protected against measles can get the illness—and children are especially at risk of getting seriously sick. You may be wondering how to keep your family safe.

“Measles is more than just a rash; it can lead to severe illness, and it’s extremely contagious—you can catch it just from being in the same room as an infected person,” explained Dr. Eric Deussing, Public Health Emergency Officer for the Defense Health Agency. “So, it’s important to take steps to keep you and your loved ones protected and learn how to recognize potential symptoms. Two doses of the measles, mumps, and rubella, or MMR, vaccine provide the best protection against measles.”

Here’s what you need to know.

What is measles?

Measles is a highly contagious illness that can cause serious complications. It spreads through the air when an infected person coughs or sneezes—sometimes, this happens up to four days before they’re even showing symptoms.

People of any age can get serious cases of measles. But the following groups are at increased risk for complications:

Children younger than age 5

Adults older than age 20

Pregnant women

People with weakened immune systems

Recognizing measles signs and symptoms

Measles symptoms usually appear between seven and 14 days after infection.

Initial symptoms typically include:

High fever (sometimes above 104 degrees)

Cough

Runny nose

Red, watery eyes

Two to three days after the start of symptoms, you may see tiny white spots (Koplik spots) in your mouth.

In three to five days, you may develop the measles rash—flat red spots that usually start on the face, and then spread down the body towards the feet.

Common complications of measles are ear infections and diarrhea. More severe complications can include pneumonia, swelling of the brain, and other conditions that can lead to hospitalization.

Are you or a family member showing signs of measles? Call the Military Health System Nurse Advice Line at 800-TRICARE (874-2273). Describe your symptoms to a registered nurse, who can advise you on what to do next.

Preventing measles

Your best defense against measles is getting vaccinated. Most people who got their vaccination have protection against measles for life, as described by the CDC.

The measles, mumps, and rubella, or MMR, vaccine protects against measles as well as mumps and rubella. This vaccine is available to those older than 12 months old.

The measles, mumps, rubella, and varicella, or MMRV, vaccine protects against these illnesses as well as chickenpox. This vaccine is only available to children 12 months old through 12 years old.

Both the MMR and MMRV vaccines are administered in two doses. Children under age 12 should get the first dose between 12 and 15 months old, and the second between 4 and 6 years old. (Children may also get the MMRV second dose three months after the first dose.)

Older children, teenagers, and adults should get one or two doses of the MMR vaccine if they don’t have evidence of immunity. (Note: You’re considered immune if you were born before 1957, since it’s likely you were infected naturally.) Doses should be given at least 28 days apart.

TRICARE covers age-appropriate doses of these vaccines, as recommended by the CDC. You don’t need a referral or other approval to get these vaccines. As described in the TRICARE Pharmacy Program Handbook, you can get these vaccines at no cost, as long as you:

Go to a military hospital or clinic

Go to a TRICARE retail network pharmacy. Make sure the person who gives you the vaccine is a pharmacist. If another type of provider gives you a vaccine at a retail pharmacy, you may have out-of-pocket costs.

See a TRICARE-authorized civilian provider. However, if you get other services at the same time, you may have to pay copayments or cost-shares. These costs vary based on your health plan.

If you live overseas, you can get vaccinated at your local military hospital or clinic or by a TRICARE-authorized civilian provider.

Do you have more questions about the measles or getting an MMR or MMRV vaccine for yourself or your child? Talk to your healthcare provider or contact the MHS Nurse Advice Line.",https://www.militaryspot.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/TRICARE-measles.png,N,,2025-07-12 02:56:12.676356

REF F IS THE DOD IMPLEMENTATION GUIDANCE FOR MANAGING BRAIN HEALTH RISKS FOR

BLAST OVERPRESSURE//

RMKS/1. The Department of the Navy (DON) remains committed to the health and

safety of our Sailors and Marines. Decades of combat operations have taught

us that some injuries particularly to the brain may not be immediately

apparent and repeated exposure to certain conditions can have cumulative

effects. The science surrounding these exposures continues to evolve, and we

recognize a strong relationship between Blast Overpressure (BOP) and the

Warfighter Brain Health (WBH).

2. As discussed in reference (a), the WBH Initiative addresses concussions

and other forms of Traumatic Brain Injury (TBI). Brain injuries may result

from direct impacts, exposure to blasts or low-level blasts or operation of

certain weapons systems. BOP encompasses exposure to events that release

energy through multiple pathways (impulse noise, pressure waves, body

acceleration, and vibration), potentially causing injury. These exposures

may occur in combat, operational evolutions and training environments.

3. Managing risks related to BOP and WBH spans across operations, training,

safety, medical and information communities. Reference (b) establishes four

pounds per square inch (psi) as the action threshold for BOP exposure.

Per reference (c), the four psi action threshold is consistently reached or

exceeded by operators of shoulder- fired weapons. Other activities, such as

training involving detonations, have the potential to exceed four psi and may

amplify or prolong exposures of any level. Therefore, DON categorizes such

personnel as high risk based on the definition below, and these personnel

must complete a Cognitive Monitoring Program (CMP) baseline assessment by

September 30, 2025 as required by reference (b). The Department of Defense

(DoD) tool to complete a CMP baseline is the Automated Neuropsychological

Assessment Metrics.

a. High-risk is defined as all Active Component personnel assigned to

units where they will or are likely to engage in training or operational

activities that place them in the proximity of weapons systems recognized or

suspected to produce hazardous BOP exposures often within a 12-month period.

The term ""often"" means a more frequent or regular exposure, such as daily or

multiple times per week, with little variability. The term ""high-risk"" would

traditionally include those assigned to ""warfighter"" and training units.

4. All other DON active-duty military members must be baselined by September

30, 2027. These efforts are directly tied to overall force readiness.

5. CMP baseline assessments have been a longstanding pre- deployment

requirement per references (d) and (e), though previously, shipboard

personnel were exempt. Reference (b) rescinds that exemption. Currently,

baseline assessment capabilities exist at several locations, including Camp

Lejeune, Camp Pendleton and Marine Corps Air Ground Combat Center Twentynine

Palms. A complete list of all CMP testing sites can be found at:

https://esportal.med.navy.mil/bumed/rh/m3/M33/Pages/TBI.aspx.

As there are many additional sites being created across the DoD, this list

will be updated regularly.

6. Chief of Naval Operations and Commandant of the Marine Corps will:

a. Designate a Navy and a Marine Corps BOP Management Action Lead at the

O-7 level or above to be responsible and accountable for implementing BOP and

WBH requirements including those listed in the references. Notify Assistant

Secretary of the Navy for Energy, Installations, and Environment (ASN (EI&E))

via Memorandum of the BOP Management Action Lead designations no later than

July 24, 2025. ASN

(EI&E) will coordinate with the BOP Management Action Leads to ensure

implementation of all requirements.

7. The Management Action Leads for the Navy and the Marine Corps will ensure

that Commanders and Commanding Officers:

a. Leverage existing capabilities at installations conducting live-fire

activities to facilitate baseline cognitive assessments for personnel who are

deemed high-risk based on the guidance above.

b. Utilize remaining capabilities to assess personnel who are deemed

increased-risk based on the guidance above, followed by all remaining

personnel if resources are available.

c. Support the establishment of additional testing locations, including

but not limited to, providing physical space for testing sites (when

necessary) and identifying personnel who can serve as proctors for testing.

d. Direct exposed personnel to existing training sites as capacity

becomes available.

8. All DON personnel will:

a. Be vigilant for symptoms which may be attributable to exposure to BOP

in oneself and others. An excellent resource created by the Defense Health

Agency Traumatic Brain Injury Center of Excellence is the following:

https://health.mil/Reference-Center/Fact-Sheets/2024/10/16/Low-Level-BlastService-Members-Fact-Sheet

b. Promptly report suspected brain injuries to the cognizant medical

department and chain of command.

9. Every member of the DON is responsible for minimizing the risk of brain

injury. Through vigilance and proactive behavior, we strengthen our

collective ability to protect our mission and our people.

10. Our success depends on the commitment of every Sailor, Marine, civilian,

and contractor. Together, we will maintain a secure environment that

protects both mission accomplishment and the safety of our force.

Abbott’s TriClip G5 device, the only FDA-approved T-TEER device, will now be covered by Medicare, ensuring long-term, predictable access to a minimally invasive treatment option for eligible Medicare and Medicare Advantage beneficiaries. This important decision marks a pivotal development in expanding access to a potentially lifesaving treatment for the approximately 1.6 million people in the U.S. with moderate or severe TR who currently have limited options.

For many patients who are not candidates for open-heart surgery, TriClip offers a path to significantly improved quality of life and a reduction in heart failure hospitalizations.

These plans serve active duty service members, National Guard and Reserve members, military retirees, and family members living overseas.

“Getting care while living overseas doesn’t have to be difficult,” said Michelle Donnelly, health system specialist, TRICARE Area Office – Latin America and Canada, TRICARE Health Plan, at the Defense Health Agency. “It’s important to know which health plan options you’re eligible for, so you can ensure a smooth process for getting care.”

Here’s what you should know about getting and using TRICARE health plans overseas.

Plan options

TRICARE Prime plans for active duty families

There are two TRICARE Prime health plans for ADSMs and their command-sponsored family members overseas:

TRICARE Prime Overseas

TRICARE Prime Remote Overseas (only in overseas areas remote from a military hospital or clinic)

These plans work like health maintenance organizations in the U.S. You receive most of your health care from your primary care manager. For those enrolled in TRICARE Prime Remote Overseas, the overseas contractor, International SOS, serves as your PCM. Key features include:

No enrollment fees

No out-of-pocket costs when you visit your PCM

Possible additional costs if you see providers outside the TRICARE network

But there are different requirements for ADSMs and active duty family members:

ADSMs stationed overseas must use TRICARE Prime Overseas or TRICARE Prime Remote Overseas, as described in the TRICARE Overseas Program Handbook.

Eligible command-sponsored ADFMs can enroll in TRICARE Prime Overseas, TRICARE Prime Remote Overseas (based on your location), or TRICARE Select Overseas.

Families can split their coverage when some family members live in the U.S. and others live overseas. This allows each family member to have the most appropriate plan for their needs and location.

TRICARE Select plans

TRICARE Select Overseas is available to:

ADFMs

Retired service members and their family members

National Guard and Reserve members and their family members

Survivors of deceased service members

Medal of Honor recipients and their family members

Some former spouses who qualify for benefits

TRICARE Select plans typically allow you to visit health care providers of your choice. However, you should know that:

You need to pay for care at the time you receive it.

You must file claims for reimbursement.

Some countries have rules that might limit provider choice.

You don’t need referrals for most medical care with a TRICARE Select plan. However, some treatments and procedures need approval before you receive care. You might also have the option to get care at a military hospital or clinic if space is available.

Other TRICARE plan options

You or your family members may qualify for other TRICARE plans overseas. These other health coverage options include:

TRICARE For Life: For beneficiaries who have Medicare Part A and Part B

TRICARE Young Adult: For qualified adult children who have aged out of TRICARE

TRICARE Reserve Select: For Selected Reserve members and their family members

TRICARE Retired Reserve: For Retired Reserve members and their family members

National Guard and Reserve members can enroll in these plans at any time during the year. If you’re activated for more than 30 days, you automatically receive active duty health benefits.

How care overseas differs from care in the U.S.

Getting medical care overseas differs in several important ways from care in the U.S.:

You have three years to file claims for care received overseas, compared to one year in the U.S., Puerto Rico, and U.S. territories. Check out the TRICARE Newsroom to learn more about overseas claims and how TRICARE has improved overseas claims processing. Filing claims online through the TRICARE Overseas Program Beneficiary Secure Claims Portal gives you the fastest service.

Providers can charge more than the rates TRICARE has established as allowable. You’re must pay any costs above the TRICARE allowable charge.

Some services may need pre-authorization before you receive them.

If you live overseas, you may have access to some additional tools to help you get care. These include:

Beneficiary Support Center: The Beneficiary Support Center is available 24/7. They’ll connect you with telephonic language assistance, answer questions about enrollment, claims, and more. Call the TRICARE Overseas Program Regional Call Center to contact the BSC.

MyCare OverseasTM Beneficiary App: The MyCare OverseasTM app helps you access information about your health plan. You can explore your options for overseas providers, appointments, referrals, claims, and more. You can download the mobile app for free. Visit the International SOS website to learn more.

Near Patient Program: If you have TRICARE Prime Overseas or TRICARE Prime Remote Overseas, the NPP can help facilitate your health care in ten overseas locations. The program uses teams of in-country medical professionals who speak the local language to help you navigate your local health care system. If you aren’t in an NPP location, the TOP Regional Call Center can provide support. Visit the International SOS website to learn more.

Preparing to move overseas

If you receive orders overseas:

Complete a thorough health screening before your departure.

Update your personal address in the Defense Enrollment Eligibility Reporting System after you’ve arrived at your overseas address.

Get recommended vaccinations.

Bring enough medication to last throughout your move and initial weeks.

Take care of routine health needs before moving overseas.

When you complete your permanent change of station overseas, you have 90 days to change your TRICARE health plan, as this counts as a TRICARE Qualifying Life Event. Update your personal address in DEERS after you’ve arrived at your overseas address.

Note: You need to see a certified or preferred provider if you live or travel in the Philippines. Use the Philippine Provider Search Tool to locate a provider near you.

,,2025-07-11 20:39:58+00:00,Instagram,Is your healthcare provider worried about decreasing TRICARE reimbursement rates ... - Instagram,Not Available,,,,,https://www.instagram.com/p/DL-QYMzO423/,"0 likes, 0 comments - missionalphaadvocacy on July 11, 2025: ""Is your healthcare provider worried about decreasing TRICARE reimbursement rates?

Here's why...

TRICARE calculates reimbursement rates on Medicare rates. In the mid-1990s TRICARE and other commercial insurance companies paid roughly 120% of Medicare rates.

Then TRICARE began to pay 80% of the Medicare rates and other commercial insurances followed their example.

This leads to the bigger issue... Medicare reimbursement rates continue to decrease even though the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) project another 3.5% rise in the Medicare Economic Index (this index measures the cost of running a medical clinic).

👎The bottom line: Rising cost to run a medical clinic but decreasing reimbursement rates.

Now compound the reimbursement rate issues with the hassle of navigating the complicated TRICARE system that is rife with provider reimbursement delays, heavy administrative burden, referral issues, provider credentialing issues, and poor customer services.

The leads to many providers asking the question ""Is it a smart business decision to continue taking TRICARE patients?""

Until Congress acts to correct the TRICARE reimbursement calculation and prevent further decrease in Medicare reimbursement rates, providers will continue to migrate to greener pastures. They will choose to work with easier insurance companies.

Military families will more frequently face provider shortages and receive assignments to medical deserts.

Poor access to healthcare is a military readiness issue.

Military Health System Saves His Sight “They just came up with the best plan of action: take me out of the theater and take me over to Iraq and get medical treatment.
Seeking Help, Setting Sights on the Games After three months of comprehensive treatment, Brown regained 90% of sight in his injured left eye thanks to the care of his Military Health System team.
While his sight was back, he was finding it hard to navigate life—until he reached out for mental health support at the hospital.
He also sought out the U.S. Army’s Soldier Recovery Unit, where he found a new purpose, a new mission: working on himself.","While deployed to Syria in 2023, U.S. Army Master Sgt. Earlie Brown served as a construction engineer supervisor for infrastructure development projects in the Middle East—a job where vision played a crucial role.

“I was in charge of 30 people, going over blueprints and diagrams, building a landing pad that can land six helicopters and two walls in the middle of them,” he recalled. “So, if drones and bombs were coming in, it couldn’t destroy a whole fleet of helicopters.”

Being deployed near enemy lines, his eyes were more than just a part of construction work–they were critical to the mission.

“You need to try to understand who your enemy is, to understand the direction in which an attack is coming, to be aware of your surroundings, and to be able to shoot down your target that's 300 meters away,” Brown said.

Working in an austere environment, dealing with lots of sand, debris and dust, he knew the importance of wearing protective eyewear and “would always cover my eyes with protection when my guys were out in the field working.”

Yet the job site had other dangers. “In our facility, we had bad water out there because of the waters from the rivers, and that's what we were taking showers with. I think it was a combination between the water and a lot of dust that got in my eyes.”

The pain in Brown’s eyes intensified over time, so much that even looking at dim light was agony.

“I went out to take a shower at nighttime. With just a little bit of light that I encountered, it hurt my eyes so bad,” he said. “I was trying to heal myself with eye drops, and I told the doctor, ‘I'm fine. Just let me keep going on with my mission.’”

Despite the eye pain, Brown tried to push through. “For about a week, I hid in the tent and supervised my guys from there. I'm like, ‘Listen, I'm feeling really bad right now and it’s really hurting my eyes, so I'm going to give you all the directions and instructions for the day and carry out the mission.’”

When he started to lose his vision, Brown went to the military doctor assigned to the base and “asked him to give me some steroid eye drops so I can continue treating myself. I was trying to fight to stay with my guys in Syria, but my eyes weren’t getting any better.” In looking at his red, dry, and swollen eyes, the doctor knew the master sergeant wasn’t fine.

Brown was medically evacuated.

Military Health System Saves His Sight

“They just came up with the best plan of action: take me out of the theater and take me over to Iraq and get medical treatment. Once I got to Iraq, the symptoms got even worse,” Brown said. “I’ve never felt pain like that in my life. I went down to about 20% of vision … it was scary to think that I might lose my vision and my left eye.”

He learned that with eye health, what’s important is what lies beneath.

Even though the doctors told him they could see the damage in the back of his eye, he was still in a deployed hospital with limited resources. Brown was facing another prognosis: orders to go home to be treated properly.

Brown fondly looked back on the effort to get him home. A medevac unit -- call sign Dust Off -- flying back from a deployment stopped in Iraq because they knew they had to “get this guy back to America, ASAP,” he said. “And I remember them doing that for me … in my treatment, I've seen a lot of people going out of their way and just making me a priority and I know they have my back, and they have my best intentions with my health.”

He was flown first to Landstuhl Regional Medical Center and then to Walter Reed National Military Medical Center, where he saw ophthalmologists and optometrists, was put on steroid therapies, and treated for uveitis, a condition where the middle layer of the eye becomes inflamed.

Seeking Help, Setting Sights on the Games

After three months of comprehensive treatment, Brown regained 90% of sight in his injured left eye thanks to the care of his Military Health System team.

“A lot of times when we go through stuff we deal with, we push through, but this was the type of pain that I needed medical care and help with,” Brown said. “The people who treated me care for you like you're one of their children.”

Yet he struggled with being “away from the fight” and his responsibility to his platoon. While his sight was back, he was finding it hard to navigate life—until he reached out for mental health support at the hospital. There, he said, he “found his compass.”

“The mental health professionals are your counselors and without that compass, there's a good chance that you might get lost. So, use your tools,” he said.

He also sought out the U.S. Army’s Soldier Recovery Unit, where he found a new purpose, a new mission: working on himself.

“It's always our job to take care of the people and to make sure the mission is straight. But now, the No. 1 mission is just self-healing, self-awareness, and self-improvement.”

While he still served, the SRU brought him many opportunities to plan for his next steps after retiring. “They put me on with a mentorship program, helped me get back into college with Veteran Readiness and Employment, which is an amazing program … I'm working on my degree in business management, so I might be able to get an office job. I’m now able to do what most soldiers do—find a way to stay in a fight. Just because we’re dealing with something doesn’t mean that we're defeated.”

Through the SRU’s adaptive sports program, Brown found a new vision for his future: athlete for Team Army in the 2025 Department of Defense Warrior Games.

He’s competing in wheelchair basketball, wheelchair rugby, sitting volleyball, and swimming.

To him, it’s not just a sports competition. “All opportunities that can come from it, the support that you get from it, and traveling that you get to do—being a part of it gives you the ability to bond with a whole lot of other soldiers, and everybody's going through something, whether it's mentally or physically.”

As he heads into the competition in July 2025, Brown will have eyes on the finish line, with his family—who have a legacy of military service—by his side.

“When my brothers joined, I had seen them becoming men and that inspired me. My main purpose was to turn me into what they were. Something I could be proud of,” said Brown who has served in the U.S. Army for 24 years. “And my mom, she's just very supportive and she's very proud that she gets to be here for me.”",https://d1ldvf68ux039x.cloudfront.net/thumbs/photos/2504/8955734/1000w_q95.jpg,N,,2025-07-11 16:56:35.900169

Contact Information: Bragar Eagel & Squire, P.C.","NEW YORK, July 10, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Bragar Eagel & Squire, P.C., a nationally recognized shareholder rights law firm, is investigating potential claims against Zynex, Inc. (NASDAQ:ZYXI) on behalf of long-term stockholders following a class action complaint that was filed against Zynex on July 9, 2025 with a Class Period from March 13, 2023, to the present. Our investigation concerns whether the board of directors of Zynex have breached their fiduciary duties to the company.

The complaint alleges that the Individual Defendants began artificially inflating Zynex’s stock price by issuing or allowing false and misleading statements about the Company’s financial performance, operational practices, and compliance with insurance reimbursement policies. These statements concealed a systemic “oversupplying scheme” whereby Zynex shipped excessive quantities of supplies, such as electrode pads and batteries, to patients, billing insurers for thousands of dollars more than necessary. Zynex’s undisclosed practices drew scrutiny from insurers, including Tricare (the federal health insurer for the military), which represented 20–25% of its annual revenue.

The full extent of Zynex’s misconduct was finally revealed on March 11, 2025, when the Company issued a press release announcing fourth-quarter and full-year 2024 results. The release disclosed a significant revenue “shortfall” due to “slower than normal payments from certain payers” and revealed, “Tricare has temporarily suspended payments as they review prior claims.” The March 11, 2025, press release admitted that Tricare, representing 20% to 25% of Zynex’s annual revenue, was scrutinizing prior claims, threatening the Company’s financial stability.

The next day, on March 12, 2025, Zynex’s stock price plummeted $3.59 per share, or 51.3%, closing at $3.41 per share. This catastrophic decline wiped out significant shareholder value, reflecting the market’s reaction to Zynex’s exposure to regulatory and financial risks concealed by the Individual Defendants.

More significantly, under the criminal health care fraud statute, criminal charges may be pursued for schemes to defraud health care benefit programs (which include commercial health plans), requiring proof of willful intent beyond a reasonable doubt.
Defensive Strategies Health care providers may have several strong defenses against these potential claims.
The Broader Context The DOJ’s announcement represents a significant development in federal health care fraud enforcement.","In a brief press release published on July 9, 2025, the Department of Justice (DOJ) announced the issuance of more than 20 subpoenas to doctors and clinics as part of investigations into health care fraud, false statements, and related federal violations. The actions specifically target health care providers involved in transgender medical procedures for minors, representing a significant enforcement response that warrants careful analysis.

Understanding the Legal Landscape

Any health care provider facing a federal subpoena regarding this issue should understand the likely legal theories the DOJ will pursue and the defensive strategies available. Based on the announcement’s emphasis on “health care fraud” and a recent memorandum published by the DOJ’s Civil Division, several federal statutes appear relevant, including the False Claims Act (FCA), the Food, Drug & Cosmetic Act (FD&C Act), and the criminal health care fraud statute.

The government is likely to allege that providers submitted false claims to federal health care programs, such as Medicaid or TRICARE. The FCA targets anyone who “knowingly presents, or causes to be presented, a false or fraudulent claim for payment or approval.” Claims can be considered factually false (billing for services not rendered) or legally false (failing to comply with material requirements). The DOJ could also attempt to apply FD&C Act misbranding provisions to physicians prescribing Food & Drug Administration (FDA)-approved medications for off-label uses, although such claims would be relatively novel and would represent a potentially problematic expansion of traditional enforcement. More significantly, under the criminal health care fraud statute, criminal charges may be pursued for schemes to defraud health care benefit programs (which include commercial health plans), requiring proof of willful intent beyond a reasonable doubt.

Defensive Strategies

Health care providers may have several strong defenses against these potential claims. For example, if faced with FCA or criminal fraud claims, a provider might argue that care was medically necessary and demonstrate that treatments followed established standards of care recognized by major medical associations. If coding is an issue, a provider could try to show that their coding was accurate based on diagnosed conditions and services rendered. In any case, the provider could argue good faith and the absence of intent to defraud the government, as required by the FCA’s “knowingly” standard. Defenses to misbranding allegations due to off-label prescribing of FDA-approved medications could be that such activity falls within accepted medical practice and professional judgment, or that private physician communications with individual patients about the risks and benefits of an off-label treatment do not cause drug products to be misbranded under the FD&C Act.

Challenging Federal Subpoenas

A provider may have several grounds for filing a motion to quash under Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 17(c)(2), including that the subpoena is unduly burdensome in proportion to any legitimate need or that it constitutes a “fishing expedition” rather than a targeted investigation of specific misconduct. Constitutional privacy protections also could be raised by arguing that the sensitive medical information of minors outweighs investigative interests. A provider also could argue that the subpoena violates the patient-provider privilege or that it otherwise encroaches on the practice of medicine. However, during a recent Federal Trade Commission (FTC) workshop entitled “The Dangers of ‘Gender-Affirming’ Care for Minors,” the FTC Chairman asserted that government enforcement actions of this nature do not interfere with the practice of medicine.

Strategic Considerations for Providers

A provider who receives a subpoena related to gender-affirming care should take immediate action in light of the complexities of federal investigations. For example, an internal audit of billing and clinical documentation practices under the protection of attorney-client privilege should be considered.

Broader coordinated defense strategies may be warranted, including joint defense groups with other targeted providers, to facilitate information sharing, coordinated legal strategy, and the pooling of resources. For example, engaging shared medical experts to establish standard of care evidence may effectively counter government narratives. Also, seeking support from medical associations and professional organizations through amicus curiae briefs can provide additional credibility and educational value for courts unfamiliar with the medical standards at issue.

The Broader Context

The DOJ’s announcement represents a significant development in federal health care fraud enforcement. The scope and coordination of subpoenas suggest a comprehensive investigation that may set precedents for future enforcement actions in contested areas of medical practice. Health care providers should recognize that federal investigations of this magnitude typically involve substantial resources and extended timelines, so early preparation and strategic legal counsel are essential for protecting both professional interests and patient care obligations.

The next targets are likely to be pharmaceutical manufacturers and distributors as well as online pharmacies. As discussed in a recent post, the Civil Division has announced its intent to use the FD&C Act and other laws to pursue manufacturers and distributors for making false representations about the use of FDA-approved products to facilitate a minor’s so-called “gender transition,” as well as “dealers” suspected of illegally selling such products (e.g., pharmacies).

Conclusion

While the legal theories that may underlie these investigations face significant challenges, the federal government’s enforcement capabilities require serious attention from targeted providers. The intersection of health care fraud law, constitutional privacy rights, and professional medical practice creates a complex legal environment that demands experienced counsel.

Providers facing federal subpoenas should act promptly to protect their interests while maintaining their commitment to patient care. As the legal landscape in this area continues to evolve, staying informed about developments is crucial for health care professionals operating in this regulatory environment.",https://www.mintz.com/sites/default/files/media/images/2020-02-14/Health-Care_Small_Viewpoints.png,N,,2025-07-11 14:56:27.527022

Joe, without the threat of GI flow!” Food safety Critical to Warfighter Lethality A foodborne illness can shut down a unit faster than an ambush.","When service members are deployed, their safety depends on much more than their personal protective equipment and extensive training. Safety starts with what’s on their plate.

Behind every meal served to a soldier, sailor, airman, Guardian, or Marine, the U.S. Army Veterinary Corps is working hard to make sure that food is safe to eat, whether in the field or at the installation dining facility.

The mission of the veterinary corps goes beyond taking care of animals. Its expertise plays a vital role in ensuring food safety and public health protection across the Department of Defense.

Food Safety Starts Long Before the First Bite

Specialized Medical Detachment (Veterinary Service Support) teams, or MDVSSs, evaluate food safety in the field and at military bases, said U.S. Army Chief Warrant Officer 5 Oscar Carrión, Interagency Integrator (Food Protection) at Defense Health Agency Veterinary Services Division in Falls Church, Virginia. These detachments work under defined guidelines based on troop numbers and operational scope, providing scalable support whether the mission involves 60,000 troops in combat or 12,000 in humanitarian-support roles.

The veterinary corps accomplishes these actions not only with active duty assets, but the U.S. Army Reserve constantly supports the global combatant commands as well, said Carrión. “Our USAR MDVSSs fill constant rotations to U.S. Central Command and support U.S. Southern Command,” he said. “Without the USAR VC component, the active duty VC assets would be stretched thin.”

These teams support high-profile training exercises, overseas deployments, disaster relief operations, and U.S. Navy resupply missions, said Carrión. Their role is crucial in maintaining food safety whether at sea, on the ground, or in the air. “We are key participants in pre-deployment activities and high-visibility exercises around the world,” said Carrión.

The MDVSSs not only evaluate the quality of food upon arrival, but they also inspect and test items for signs of spoilage, contamination, and storage issues, said Carrión. Their inspections include visual checks and rapid-diagnostic tests to catch threats early. These checks ensure all food received is safe and originates from DOD-approved sources. “We’re focused on food safety for all service members,” said Carrión. “MDVSS teams conduct sanitation audits of food vendors and facilities to ensure compliance with military food safety standards. Field units often rely on local suppliers, so these audits are essential to avoid introducing unfamiliar or unregulated risks into the supply chain.”

Battling Invisible Enemies

U.S. Army Lt. Col. Melissa Hehr, deputy chief, DHA Veterinary Services Division, says the U.S. Army Veterinary Corps treats bacteria and viruses like an enemy force. “If we think of foodborne pathogens as an enemy force, with the capability to move virtually undetected throughout the operational environment, then the connection between illness prevention and warfighter lethality becomes much clearer,” she said.

The enemy in this case includes norovirus, salmonellosis, listeriosis, toxoplasmosis, campylobacteriosis and infections caused by Staphylococcus aureus and E. coli. Some of these pathogens are common at home and in base or garrison environments, while others, such as cholera or brucellosis, and intestinal parasites are more likely to be encountered overseas.

“The veterinary corps’ deterrence strategy is to deploy capabilities that will disrupt pathogen freedom of movement from the environment to a food source, whether it’s an animal intended for food, or a fresh fruit or vegetable,” said Hehr. “We do this by inspecting food sources for evidence of disease or contamination, then neutralizing any detected threats.”

The food safety management system uses hazard analysis and critical control points, or HACCP, to ensure that even if a pathogen does infiltrate food-processing operations, it is still denied access, said Hehr. By setting up layered safety mechanisms such as temperature controls, secure transport, and facility sanitation audits, the veterinary corps helps intercept these threats before they can reach a service member’s tray or mess kit.

“Pathogens that make it through are met with control points we monitor vigilantly, and if needed, we destroy them with heat or chemicals,” she said. “Essentially, the veterinary corps’ offensive posture towards foodborne illness enemies enables the warfighter to focus on being G.I. Joe, without the threat of GI flow!”

Food safety Critical to Warfighter Lethality

A foodborne illness can shut down a unit faster than an ambush. It doesn’t matter how advanced U.S. warfighting technology is—or even how robust U.S. military healthcare capabilities are—food safety is an essential requirement for combat effectiveness, said Hehr.

The dangers of contaminated food range from minor gastrointestinal distress to full-blown outbreaks that can leave dozens of personnel unable to perform their duties. “Without life-sustaining food, warfighters are 100% combat-ineffective,” she said. “Protecting the food supply is paramount to maintaining force health and combat readiness. That’s why the veterinary corps works tirelessly around the globe to lead DOD’s food protection mission, diligently defending the food supply from threats, expertly ensuring food safety, and resolutely enabling lethality.”

Creating a Culture of Clean and Safe Meals

Food safety isn’t a one-person job. It requires training, teamwork, and leadership support. “A culture of food safety is a team effort,” said Carrión. “It depends greatly on the unit’s leadership and combatant commanders to support it just as much as any other safety measure critical to the DOD mission.”

The veterinary corps partners with culinary specialists, preventive medicine teams, and unit field sanitation crews to build that culture, said Carrión. From handwashing stations to kitchen audits, every piece matters. Field sanitation teams are particularly important for teaching troops how to maintain personal hygiene in austere environments. “We eat at least three meals every day,” said Carrión. “So, the safety of our food, the cooking process, and sanitation at our dining facilities are critical, especially during deployments.”

Creating a strong food safety culture also involves education. The Joint Culinary Center of Excellence and U.S. Army Medical Center of Excellence provide training for food service personnel and public health specialists. This training reinforces the idea that preventing illness is just as important as preparing tasty meals.

The Quiet Professionals

Service members may not see the behind-the-scenes work the veterinary corps does every day, and that’s okay with Carrión. Their goal is to prevent problems before they start. Even small actions such as checking the temperature of food, ensuring clean water sources, or inspecting local vendors can have a major impact on the health of deployed forces. When illnesses do occur, these teams are ready to assist preventive medicine assets in investigating outbreaks, tracing sources, and implementing corrective actions immediately. “Our silent public health and culinary service assets are always on duty protecting the force,” he said.

So, the next time you unwrap an MRE or head through the chow line, remember that your meal is not just food—it’s fuel—and the Army Veterinary Corps’ professionals are there to ensure you can consume it safely.

But you said nothing about regular VA health care. If a non-career veteran is eligible for VA health care, couldn’t that be used in place of Medicare? Signed: Veteran Advocate

Dear Veteran Advocate: Thank you for your feedback. FYI, I have previously explained numerous times that veterans who rely on the VA for 100% of their healthcare can, indeed, disenroll from Medicare Part B (thus saving the monthly Part B premium). I don’t personally recommend it because of my personal experience, but it certainly is possible to do so.

Personally, I use the VA for some of my healthcare needs – usually an annual checkup and optometry services – at my local VA clinic which is only a mile away from where I live. But for any extensive treatment needs (medical tests, etc.) I must travel about 40 miles to the nearest VA hospital facility. For contrast, I have numerous private healthcare services, specialists, and hospitals very near where I live, but to use them under the VA I must get VA preapproval and use only certain VA-approved providers, which is inconvenient for me. Personally, I prefer the freedom to go to any healthcare service provider I choose, without restriction, at any time I need to. So, I use my VA coverage when it is convenient for me but rely also on non-VA, Medicare-approved specialists who I can choose to use (or not) at will. For me, it’s a matter of convenience and the freedom to use whichever healthcare provider I want. That said, I fully understand that some veterans rely exclusively on the VA for their healthcare needs, and I have explained to many who have written to me that they have that option. I have also published several public articles about this as well. Here is one such article:

So, please rest assured that we regularly advise our veterans about their healthcare options under Medicare, including the ability to decline Medicare Part B coverage if they have full VA healthcare coverage. FYI, free Medicare Part A (inpatient hospitalization coverage) is mandatory to collect Social Security after age 65, but Medicare Part B coverage is always optional because there is a premium associated with Part B. A veteran can decline Medicare Part B coverage and save that monthly premium, but they would need to contact Social Security to do so. Social Security will want to interview the veteran to ensure they are aware of the potential financial consequences of not having Medicare Part B. And they may need to file form CMS-1763 (Request for Termination) But a non-career veteran can opt out of Medicare Part B if they get all of their healthcare services through the Veterans Administration.",https://thepaper24-7.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/cropped-place-holder-image-32x32.jpg,N,,2025-07-11 10:56:18.588265

These plans serve active duty service members, National Guard and Reserve members, military retirees, and family members living overseas.

“Getting care while living overseas doesn’t have to be difficult,” said Michelle Donnelly, health system specialist, TRICARE Area Office – Latin America and Canada, TRICARE Health Plan, at the Defense Health Agency. “It’s important to know which health plan options you’re eligible for, so you can ensure a smooth process for getting care.”

Here’s what you should know about getting and using TRICARE health plans overseas.

Plan options

TRICARE Prime plans for active duty families

There are two TRICARE Prime health plans for ADSMs and their command-sponsored family members overseas:

TRICARE Prime Overseas

TRICARE Prime Remote Overseas (only in overseas areas remote from a military hospital or clinic)

These plans work like health maintenance organizations in the U.S. You receive most of your health care from your primary care manager. For those enrolled in TRICARE Prime Remote Overseas, the overseas contractor, International SOS, serves as your PCM. Key features include:

No enrollment fees

No out-of-pocket costs when you visit your PCM

Possible additional costs if you see providers outside the TRICARE network

But there are different requirements for ADSMs and active duty family members:

ADSMs stationed overseas must use TRICARE Prime Overseas or TRICARE Prime Remote Overseas, as described in the TRICARE Overseas Program Handbook.

Eligible command-sponsored ADFMs can enroll in TRICARE Prime Overseas, TRICARE Prime Remote Overseas (based on your location), or TRICARE Select Overseas.

Families can split their coverage when some family members live in the U.S. and others live overseas. This allows each family member to have the most appropriate plan for their needs and location.

TRICARE Select plans

TRICARE Select Overseas is available to:

ADFMs

Retired service members and their family members

National Guard and Reserve members and their family members

Survivors of deceased service members

Medal of Honor recipients and their family members

Some former spouses who qualify for benefits

TRICARE Select plans typically allow you to visit health care providers of your choice. However, you should know that:

You need to pay for care at the time you receive it.

You must file claims for reimbursement.

Some countries have rules that might limit provider choice.

You don’t need referrals for most medical care with a TRICARE Select plan. However, some treatments and procedures need approval before you receive care. You might also have the option to get care at a military hospital or clinic if space is available.

Other TRICARE plan options

You or your family members may qualify for other TRICARE plans overseas. These other health coverage options include:

TRICARE For Life: For beneficiaries who have Medicare Part A and Part B

TRICARE Young Adult: For qualified adult children who have aged out of TRICARE

TRICARE Reserve Select: For Selected Reserve members and their family members

TRICARE Retired Reserve: For Retired Reserve members and their family members

National Guard and Reserve members can enroll in these plans at any time during the year. If you’re activated for more than 30 days, you automatically receive active duty health benefits.

How care overseas differs from care in the U.S.

Getting medical care overseas differs in several important ways from care in the U.S.:

You have three years to file claims for care received overseas, compared to one year in the U.S., Puerto Rico, and U.S. territories. Check out the TRICARE Newsroom to learn more about overseas claims and how TRICARE has improved overseas claims processing. Filing claims online through the TRICARE Overseas Program Beneficiary Secure Claims Portal gives you the fastest service.

Providers can charge more than the rates TRICARE has established as allowable. You’re must pay any costs above the TRICARE allowable charge.

Some services may need pre-authorization before you receive them.

If you live overseas, you may have access to some additional tools to help you get care. These include:

Beneficiary Support Center: The Beneficiary Support Center is available 24/7. They’ll connect you with telephonic language assistance, answer questions about enrollment, claims, and more. Call the TRICARE Overseas Program Regional Call Center to contact the BSC.

MyCare OverseasTM Beneficiary App: The MyCare OverseasTM app helps you access information about your health plan. You can explore your options for overseas providers, appointments, referrals, claims, and more. You can download the mobile app for free. Visit the International SOS website to learn more.

Near Patient Program: If you have TRICARE Prime Overseas or TRICARE Prime Remote Overseas, the NPP can help facilitate your health care in ten overseas locations. The program uses teams of in-country medical professionals who speak the local language to help you navigate your local health care system. If you aren’t in an NPP location, the TOP Regional Call Center can provide support. Visit the International SOS website to learn more.

Preparing to move overseas

If you receive orders overseas:

Complete a thorough health screening before your departure.

Update your personal address in the Defense Enrollment Eligibility Reporting System after you’ve arrived at your overseas address.

Get recommended vaccinations.

Bring enough medication to last throughout your move and initial weeks.

Take care of routine health needs before moving overseas.

When you complete your permanent change of station overseas, you have 90 days to change your TRICARE health plan, as this counts as a TRICARE Qualifying Life Event. Update your personal address in DEERS after you’ve arrived at your overseas address.

Note: You need to see a certified or preferred provider if you live or travel in the Philippines. Use the Philippine Provider Search Tool to locate a provider near you.

How to change your enrollment

You can enroll in a TRICARE plan through these methods:

Going online to the milConnect website

Visiting a TRICARE Service Center in person

Calling International SOS, the TRICARE Overseas contractor

Mailing a completed enrollment form

What Are LLMs and Why Do They Matter in Insurance?

Large Language Models like OpenAI’s GPT series, Google’s Gemini, Meta’s LLaMA, and open-source frameworks like Falcon and Mistral are trained on billions of data points. In the healthcare insurance space, they unlock deep insights from complex datasets — medical records, insurance claims, policy documents, customer conversations, and regulatory guidelines.

Their ability to reason contextually, synthesize information across sources, and generate human-like language at scale enables automation and personalization that wasn’t possible before.

Real-Time Claims Processing and Automation

One of the most tangible impacts of LLMs in healthcare insurance is claims automation. Traditionally, claims go through a lengthy, manual process involving multiple checkpoints. LLMs can:

Automatically extract structured data from unstructured claim forms.

Understand clinical notes and ICD/CPT codes with medical NER (Named Entity Recognition).

Flag inconsistencies, missing data, or signs of fraud.

Auto-generate claims summaries and submit them to approval pipelines.

Companies like Anthem and UnitedHealth are already piloting LLM-driven claims workflows that reduce processing time by over 60% and increase accuracy significantly.

AI-Powered Fraud Detection

Healthcare insurance fraud costs the industry over $100 billion annually. LLMs bring a new edge to fraud analytics by:

Detecting linguistic patterns that deviate from normative claim behavior.

Performing semantic analysis across prior patient interactions and claim histories.

Working in tandem with anomaly detection models to flag suspicious activity in real-time.

For example, LLMs can detect when similar wording is reused across multiple claims, suggesting fraud rings or copy-paste schemes.

Personalized Policy Recommendations

Modern consumers expect hyper-personalized experiences — and LLMs are at the forefront of delivering them. Insurers can now:

Leverage LLMs to scan a member’s medical history, demographics, and lifestyle data.

Generate personalized policy explanations, guiding users to optimal coverage options.

Craft contextual communication that resonates with specific customer profiles.

By integrating LLMs into digital advisors and chatbots, providers are now able to deliver Netflix-style personalization — in the language of healthcare.

Enhancing Regulatory Compliance

Healthcare insurance is a compliance-heavy industry. From HIPAA to CMS rules, regulatory burden is immense. LLMs are proving vital in:

Continuously scanning regulatory documents and identifying policy impact zones.

Auto-generating compliance documentation for internal audits.

Monitoring agent communication to ensure policy adherence and avoid misrepresentation.

In fact, some insurers are using LLMs to generate instant compliance risk summaries before launching new products in different states.

Integrating LLMs into the Healthcare Insurance Tech Stack

The integration of LLMs requires thoughtful architecture. Leaders in this space are combining:

Vector Databases (like Pinecone, Weaviate) for semantic search.

RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) for grounding LLMs in up-to-date policy and claim data.

APIs and LLMOps platforms for secure deployment (Azure OpenAI, AWS Bedrock, Google Vertex AI).

A hybrid architecture — combining foundation models with insurer-specific data — ensures scalability, accuracy, and explainability.

What’s Next? The Future of LLMs in Insurance

The next frontier includes:

Multimodal LLMs integrating text, images, and lab results for deeper diagnostics.

Federated learning to protect patient privacy across distributed datasets.

Explainable AI (XAI) for regulatory transparency and trust.

In time, LLMs will become the core engine behind autonomous insurance systems — not just optimizing current operations but redefining how healthcare insurance works.

Final Thoughts

Large Language Models are not just another IT upgrade. They’re ushering in a paradigm shift — transforming healthcare insurance from a reactive, rule-based domain into a proactive, intelligent, and empathetic system.

For providers, payers, and patients alike, the promise is clear: faster care, fewer errors, deeper personalization, and fairer pricing.

The insurance companies that embrace LLMs now will not only gain a competitive edge — they’ll be designing the future of healthcare itself.
