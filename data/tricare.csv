You can drive to Kouri Island from Okinawa Island by way of the 1.3-mile-long Kouri Bridge – Japan’s third-longest toll-free bridge.
Both of these bowls are seasoned with Shirasa Shokudo’s original sauce made from sesame oil and salt.
It used to offer its extremely popular “uni-don” (sea urchin bowl) but has since removed it from the menu temporarily due to a decrease in the local sea urchin population, according to Kikuchi.
Be sure to try Shirasa Shokudo during your next drive to Kouri Island.","An old Ryukyuan legend has it that a young couple accidentally fell from the sky onto Kouri Island, becoming the first inhabitants of what we know call the Okinawan islands.

As beautiful as it is mysterious, this tiny island is an ideal day trip. And the rice-bowl dishes topped with fresh local ingredients served at Shirasa Shokudo make it an ideal eatery for anyone to drop in on.

Luckily, you needn’t take to the skies to get there.

You can drive to Kouri Island from Okinawa Island by way of the 1.3-mile-long Kouri Bridge – Japan’s third-longest toll-free bridge.

“The view from our restaurant is fantastic,” says owner Sonoko Kikuchi. Located smack-dab in the middle of a sightseeing attraction, most patrons are travelers. “From here, you can see all of majestic Kouri Bridge with the beautiful white beach and blue sea right in front of you.”

Shirasa Shokudo’s popular “kaisen-don,” or seafood bowl, for 1,500 yen ($13) is an attraction unto itself. It comes with large servings of tuna, salmon, white fish and “umibudo,” the local favorite “sea grape” type of seaweed with a crispy texture that pops in the mouth like caviar. The dish is garnished with various seasonal vegetables and, if available, island octopus. It’s all served atop vinegar-seasoned rice.

The umibudo-don (sea grape bowl), for 1,200 yen, is another option.

Both of these bowls are seasoned with Shirasa Shokudo’s original sauce made from sesame oil and salt.

“Although soy sauce is usually used for rice-bowl dishes, we don’t use it because its dark-brown color spoils the colors of other ingredients,” Kukuchi explains. “Our house-made transparent sauce can keep or even brighten the colors of the other ingredients while highlighting the flavor of each fresh local food.”

According to Kikuchi, all the dishes in her restaurant are cooked completely from scratch.

“We don’t use any precooked stuff in our dishes,” she says. “In order to serve dishes made 100-percent from scratch, we always start preparing our ingredients at 3 a.m.”

In addition to these rice-bowls, the restaurant offers taco rice, fried rice, and “goya champuru” (bitter melon stir fry). It used to offer its extremely popular “uni-don” (sea urchin bowl) but has since removed it from the menu temporarily due to a decrease in the local sea urchin population, according to Kikuchi.

“Sea urchin cannot be cultured,” she says. “So instead of using imported sea urchin as a substitute, we decided to stop serving it until the local population increases.”

The restaurant’s seating options include tables as well as traditional tatami floor seating, accommodating about 80 people in all.

Be sure to try Shirasa Shokudo during your next drive to Kouri Island. Better yet – now you have one more reason drop in on this mysterious island.

In addition, the jury determined that Omnicare's parent company, CVS Health Corporation (CVS), which acquired Omnicare in 2015, caused the false claims to be submitted.
The government further alleged that CVS ""caused"" the claims to be submitted, as it was aware of deficiencies in Omnicare's practices but failed to correct them.
After the government rested its case, CVS filed a motion for a directed verdict, arguing that the government failed to satisfy its burden that CVS ""caused"" the false claims to be submitted.
Judge McMahon reserved judgment on the motion, finding that there was enough evidence for the jury to determine false claims liability for CVS.","On April 29, 2025, a federal jury in the Southern District of New York found Omnicare liable for illegally dispensing drugs to elderly and disabled people in long-term care facilities without legitimate prescriptions. A unanimous jury concluded that Omnicare, the largest long-term care pharmacy in the United States, fraudulently billed Medicare, Medicaid, and TRICARE, a government military healthcare program, for more than three million false claims totaling more than $135 million in damages — one of the largest jury verdicts ever in an FCA case. If trebled, damages could reach more than $400 million, plus penalties. In addition, the jury determined that Omnicare's parent company, CVS Health Corporation (CVS), which acquired Omnicare in 2015, caused the false claims to be submitted.

The relator, an Omnicare pharmacist, filed suit in 2015, and in 2019 the federal government, 29 states, and the District of Columbia intervened. The four-week jury trial began on April 1, 2025. The government alleged that Omnicare dispensed drugs to individuals in assisted living and other long-term residential facilities that were not supported by valid prescriptions under state law and then submitted claims for reimbursement for those prescriptions to the federal healthcare programs. The government further alleged that CVS ""caused"" the claims to be submitted, as it was aware of deficiencies in Omnicare's practices but failed to correct them. CVS focused its defense heavily on a materiality argument, arguing that the practice at issue was allowed by law in many states and accepted by the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services.

After the government rested its case, CVS filed a motion for a directed verdict, arguing that the government failed to satisfy its burden that CVS ""caused"" the false claims to be submitted. Judge McMahon reserved judgment on the motion, finding that there was enough evidence for the jury to determine false claims liability for CVS. Specifically, she found the evidence showed that CVS ""had ultimate oversight over Omnicare's compliance with Government program regulations — indeed, was required to do so by virtue of the [Corporate Integrity Agreement]"" that CVS had entered into in 2016 related to different conduct by Omnicare; and ""that [CVS] was aware of the compliance issues that underlie this case, and the fact that certain fixes had been proposed to remedy them"" but ""opted not to force [Omnicare] to adopt those fixes.""

The parties will submit briefing over the next month addressing the penalties to be assessed under the FCA, and CVS has said that it plans to appeal the decision. We at Qui Notes will continue to keep you updated on developments in the case.

New York, New York--(Newsfile Corp. - May 17, 2025) - Faruqi & Faruqi, LLP, a leading national securities law firm, is investigating potential claims against Zynex, Inc. (""Zynex"" or the ""Company"") (NASDAQ: ZYXI) and reminds investors of the May 19, 2025 deadline to seek the role of lead plaintiff in a federal securities class action that has been filed against the Company.

Faruqi & Faruqi is a leading national securities law firm with offices in New York, Pennsylvania, California and Georgia. The firm has recovered hundreds of millions of dollars for investors since its founding in 1995. See www.faruqilaw.com.

As detailed below, the complaint alleges that the Company and its executives violated federal securities laws by making false and/or misleading statements and/or failing to disclose: (1) that Zynex shipped products, including electrodes, in excess of need; (2) that, as a result of this practice, the Company inflated its revenue; (3) that the Company's practice of filing false claims drew scrutiny from insurers, including Tricare; (4) that, as a result, it was reasonably likely that Zynex would face adverse consequences, including removal from insurer networks and penalties from the federal government; and (5) that, as a result of the foregoing, Defendants' positive statements about the Company's business, operations, and prospects were materially misleading and/or lacked a reasonable basis.

On June 4, 2024, medical journal STAT published a report on Zynex entitled ""How a device maker inundated pain patients with unwanted batteries and surprise bills."" The report claimed Zynex engaged in an ""oversupplying scheme"" by sending inordinate amounts of monthly supplies like electrode pads and batteries in order to ""bill insurers for thousands of dollars more than it otherwise could."" The report further revealed that, as a result of this practice, insurers were ""kicking the company out of network.""

On this news, Zynex's stock price fell $0.50 per share, or 5%, to close at $9.35 per share on June 4, 2024, on unusually heavy trading volume.

On March 11, 2025, after the market closed, Zynex reported its fourth quarter and full year 2024 financial results, revealing a significant revenue ""shortfall"" in the quarter ""due to slower than normal payments from certain payers."" Zynex further revealed ""Tricare has temporarily suspended payments as they review prior claims."" Tricare is the health insurance program for the U.S. military.

On this news, Zynex's stock price fell $3.59 per share, or 51.3%, to close at $3.41 per share on March 12, 2025, on unusually heavy trading volume.

The court-appointed lead plaintiff is the investor with the largest financial interest in the relief sought by the class who is adequate and typical of class members who directs and oversees the litigation on behalf of the putative class. Any member of the putative class may move the Court to serve as lead plaintiff through counsel of their choice, or may choose to do nothing and remain an absent class member. Your ability to share in any recovery is not affected by the decision to serve as a lead plaintiff or not.

Faruqi & Faruqi, LLP also encourages anyone with information regarding Zynex's conduct to contact the firm, including whistleblowers, former employees, shareholders and others.

Previously, she was the chief health officer for Viking Cruises, establishing an industry-leading C-suite model that re-started and sustained the cruise line during the COVID-19 Global Pandemic. Before Viking, she was a gubernatorial appointee as the director of Washington State COVID-19 Health System Response Management, subsequently leading the state’s Pandemic Health Response.

She is a senior fellow with the Johns Hopkins University Applied Physics Laboratory. As the former chief executive officer (CEO) and director of the Defense Health Agency (DHA), Dr. Bono led a joint, integrated combat support agency that enabled all branches of the U.S. military—Army, Navy, Air Force and Marines —medical services to provide health care services to combatant commands. She integrated an unprecedented $50 billion worldwide health care enterprise composed of 50 hospitals and 300 clinical facilities that provide care to 9.5 million military beneficiaries; oversaw the Department of Defense (DoD) deployment of the electronic health record (EHR) system; and advanced the development of an integrated health system with the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs.

Dr. Bono’s leadership positions in the DoD include: CEO/director, DHA (2015-2019); CEO/director, National Capital Region Medical Directorate (2013-2015); acting commander, Joint Task Force (JTF), National Capital Region (2013); command surgeon, U.S. Pacific Command (2011-2013); chief of staff, TRICARE, DoD (2008-2010); commanding officer (CEO), Naval Hospital, Jacksonville, Florida (2005-2008); and was deployed to the first Gulf War as head of casualty receiving, Operations Desert Shield and Desert Storm (1990-1991).

She received her bachelor’s degree from the University of Texas, Austin, her Master of Business Administration from Washington State University, Spokane and her medical degree from Texas Tech Health Sciences Center, Lubbock. She completed her surgical internship and residency at the Naval Medical Center, Portsmouth, Virginia, and performed a trauma and critical care fellowship at the Eastern Virginia Graduate School of Medicine, Norfolk, Virginia.

“Dr. Bono is a pioneering leader in military medicine, a national healthcare strategist, and someone who has made a career of stepping up when the stakes are highest,” said Salus at Drexel president Michael H. Mittelman, OD ‘80, MBA, MBA FAAO, FACHE. “From the battlefield to the boardroom, from military hospitals to international business, Dr. Bono has consistently demonstrated what true leadership looks like—visionary, compassionate, and unflinching in the face of complexity.”

To receive an emergency refill of prescription medications, TRICARE beneficiaries should take their prescription bottle to any TRICARE retail network pharmacy. If the bottle is unavailable or the label is damaged or missing, beneficiaries should contact Express Scripts, Inc., or their retail network pharmacy for assistance.

To find a network pharmacy, beneficiaries may call Express Scripts at 1-877-363-1303, or search the network pharmacy locator.

If possible, visit the pharmacy where the prescription was filled. Prescriptions filled by a retail chain may be filled at another store in that chain. If the clinician who prescribed the medication is available, beneficiaries can ask them to call in a new prescription to any network pharmacy.

As a reminder, TRICARE beneficiaries, other than active duty service members, may receive urgent care from any TRICARE-authorized urgent care center or provider and do not need a referral. This allows beneficiaries to seek nonemergency care for illnesses or injuries if their primary care provider is unavailable because of emergencies. Any TRICARE beneficiary who reasonably believes they have an emergency should always call 911 or, go to the nearest emergency room.

Beneficiaries are advised to visit Express Scripts’ Weather Notices page for updates.

They are accused of running a pill mill that generated millions of dollars.

RELATED STORIES

Stephen Burklow has been monitored by the FDLE since 2013, long before his ownership of Pace Pharmacy. They say he had a ""continued pattern of questionable behavior throughout his pharmacy career.""

Stephen and Monique Burklow own Pace Pharmacy. Both are charged with conspiring to traffic prescription pills.

The FDLE says Stephen defrauded TRICARE -- a federal healthcare program for active and retired military members -- out of $30 million in just 10 months. That was in 2015 at ""Burklow Pharmacy.""

Stephen sold the pharmacy in 2016. That's when the new owner saw financial records that didn't add up. Stephen then went to work for Pace Pharmacy in 2017.

In 2020, authorities learned narcotics were sold without a prescription for cash through the back door and drive thru there. In 2021, investigators convinced an informant to go undercover and he purchased narcotics from Pace Pharmacy.

The informant secured hundreds of bottles of prescription drugs with labels saying they were dispensed by Stephen.

Pharmacist David Winkles worked at Pace Pharmacy. Investigators say he sold 20,000 oxycodone pills for $35 a pill to a single person every week. That would fetch him $70,000 every week.

When Stephen and Monique bought Pace Pharmacy in 2022, the previous owners had already noticed finances weren't adding up.

Investigators say Stephen sold codeine, Percocet, oxycodone and hydrocodone for cash. He is also believed to have made his own stronger version of oxycodone to sell, using pill pressers at home.

Authorities say Monique also sold prescriptions without authorization, some narcotics packaged and labeled as ""COVID-19 kits.""

Investigators believe the scheme used half a dozen doctors' identities that produced thousands of fraudulent prescriptions.

To receive an emergency refill of prescription medications, TRICARE beneficiaries should take their prescription bottle to any TRICARE retail network pharmacy.

To find a network pharmacy, beneficiaries may call Express Scripts at 1-877-363-1303, or search the network pharmacy locator.

If possible, visit the pharmacy where the prescription was filled. Prescriptions filled by a retail chain may be filled at another store in that chain. If the clinician who prescribed the medication is available, beneficiaries can ask them to call in a new prescription to any network pharmacy.

As a reminder, TRICARE beneficiaries, other than active duty service members, may receive urgent care from any TRICARE-authorized urgent care center or provider and do not need a referral. This allows beneficiaries to seek nonemergency care for illnesses or injuries if their primary care provider is unavailable because of emergencies. Any TRICARE beneficiary who reasonably believes they have an emergency should always call 911 or, go to the nearest emergency room.

Beneficiaries are advised to visit Express Scripts’ Weather Notices page for updates.

Hi Justine,

The Extremity Trauma and Amputation Center of Excellence, otherwise known as EACE, leads the advancement of extremity trauma-related research and clinical practice in the Military Health System—aiming to ensure a better future for those with extremity trauma. The center is run by the Defense Health Agency.

For answers, we turned to Andrea Crunkhorn, who applies her doctorate in physical therapy and status as the chief of clinical programs for EACE to support our injured warfighters and the clinicians who care for them. She had this to say.

EACE serves as the Defense Health Agency’s center of excellence for limb trauma and limb loss. We focus on the best-supported scientific and medical data and health care for service members and other Department of Defense community members with these injuries. We foster clinical practice and provide support tools to clinicians, patients, families, and caregivers. We help the clinicians who work with these patients be as efficient and effective as possible.

EACE assists our providers as they rehabilitate our wounded warriors and create a new normal for all patients with extremity trauma and amputation. Our specialists and staff work with the Department of Veterans Affairs to create internationally recognized clinical practice guidelines, so all limb rehabilitation follows the same best evidence.

The DOD and VA published the current upper limb amputation clinical practice guideline in 2022. These documents are regularly reviewed and updated to add new treatments and programs that improve patient care. DOD-VA published our revised clinical practice guideline for lower limb amputation rehabilitation in January 2025.

EACE offers every patient like your husband a guide called “Within Reach: The Journey After Upper Limb Amputation.” The guide provides information on coping skills, pain management, caring for your remaining limb, physical rehabilitation, and artificial limbs. The guide is available digitally on the EACE website under clinical affairs.

For soon-to-be parents, parents, families, and caregivers, we have a helpful handout, “Pregnancy, Childcare and Parenting after Upper Limb Amputation Rehabilitation.” It includes tips such as how to manage child care tasks.

The DOD Amputation Prosthetics Clearinghouse is a new portal for advice, discussion, and referral to one of the three Advanced Rehabilitation Centers in the DHA. The three ARCs are located at Walter Reed National Military Medical Center in Bethesda, Maryland, where I work; Brooke Army Medical Center in San Antonio, Texas; and Naval Medical Center San Diego, in San Diego, California.

These programs lead to advances in treating and restoring function after limb trauma and amputation. The centers are the only military hospitals that fabricate and modify artificial limbs. They also provide high-quality care from before surgery until you can return to your community.

You and your military hospital or clinic providers can reach out to me and my staff with questions at either of these emails: dha.ncr.Medical-Affairs.mbx.amputation-prosth-coe@health.mil. Additionally, phone numbers for contacts at each ARC are available on the fact sheets.

Other resources include the VA’s Amputation System of Care or its Polytrauma/TBI System of Care.

EACE also has information on surgeries such as directly attaching an artificial limb to the patient’s bone. This surgery can help patients who have difficulty tolerating a socket.

EACE focuses on research that can save injured limbs, avoid amputations, and preserve and restore injured limb function. We work to make our patients return to the highest possible level of physical, mental, and emotional function. Our warfighters deserve no less. We truly appreciate all that you do.

Justine,

As you can tell, you and your husband have a lot of support in this recovery. Stay safe out there.",https://dha.mil/-/media/Project/Images/News-Images/8763232.jpg,N,0.0,2025-05-17 12:56:42.262577

You probably will hit your catastrophic cap this year and have no more out of pocket costs for wife and baby.

The $660 is probably all of your copays totaled up for your wife and baby after tricare paid their portion. You probably will hit your catastrophic cap this year and have no more out of pocket costs for wife and baby. You should always view your EOB for tricare and compare it to the hospital bill just to make sure no errors were made, but you probably just had a lot of small copays add up to a large bill.

Tricare select is still so much easier than dealing with tricare prime for spouses, so I’d recommend sticking with select vs prime for the family if you are using civilian healthcare providers. I’m switching from prime to select once my husband’s current orders are up so I don’t have to deal with getting a referral for literally everything.

I would recommend calling Tricare (tbh, they’ve been insane on wait times tho. They messed up bad switching who covered claims, and haven’t been paying out their share to drs, to the point where some people lost providers (myself included) and asking what’s going on.

We are also select and about to hit our catastrophic cap, I was looking at the EOB on the Tricare website literally yesterday because I was adding up our costs (including prescriptions) for the year. Once you hit that cap, even cost shares should be covered (unless the dr is out of network).

This bill; one of the drs could have been out of network (you can always have that happen. A dr will work somewhere but that specific dr might not take insurance. Happened to me years ago, with an emergency surgery and insurance didn’t cover the anesthesia/doctor (not tricare)). I agree with whoever said get an itemized bill of charges, sometimes they’ll charge an insane amount for Tylenol or some OTC stuff. Or add in charges because people rarely ask for itemized, esp. if insurance is covering it all.

Also adding in, sometimes tricare isn’t caught up and will bill you. We’ve gotten refund checks (albeit, end of year) from Tricare in recent years because they charged, we paid, and had overpaid.

Best of luck to you, your spouse and the new baby! Congratulations!!

We are getting told the same cost-share BS from Tricare that our hospital “actually isn’t in network.” Our hospital is literally listed on Tricare’s website as being in-network. We have called the hospital and OB office multiple times and they have confirmed they are in-network, too. We’ve escalated our case pretty high up and are waiting to hear back. Aside from the deductible and copay, you shouldn’t have to pay anything else for your baby. We’re in the thick of it too. Just keep fighting! It absolutely sucks but it’s all you can do.

Definitely look at the EOB and see if it matches up. Take diligent notes every time you call Tricare. Get names, reference numbers, etc. And be prepared to get contradictory information depending on who takes your calls. Ask to speak to supervisors if at all possible. It is a full-time job battling them. And it especially sucks battling while having a newborn. It’s not right.",,N,0.0,2025-05-16 20:56:17.575757

NEW YORK, May 16, 2025 /PRNewswire/ -- Faruqi & Faruqi, LLP, a leading national securities law firm, is investigating potential claims against Zynex, Inc. (""Zynex"" or the ""Company"") (NASDAQ: ZYXI) and reminds investors of the May 19, 2025 deadline to seek the role of lead plaintiff in a federal securities class action that has been filed against the Company.

Faruqi & Faruqi is a leading national securities law firm with offices in New York, Pennsylvania, California and Georgia. The firm has recovered hundreds of millions of dollars for investors since its founding in 1995. See www.faruqilaw.com.

As detailed below, the complaint alleges that the Company and its executives violated federal securities laws by making false and/or misleading statements and/or failing to disclose: (1) that Zynex shipped products, including electrodes, in excess of need; (2) that, as a result of this practice, the Company inflated its revenue; (3) that the Company's practice of filing false claims drew scrutiny from insurers, including Tricare; (4) that, as a result, it was reasonably likely that Zynex would face adverse consequences, including removal from insurer networks and penalties from the federal government; and (5) that, as a result of the foregoing, Defendants' positive statements about the Company's business, operations, and prospects were materially misleading and/or lacked a reasonable basis.

On June 4, 2024, medical journal STAT published a report on Zynex entitled ""How a device maker inundated pain patients with unwanted batteries and surprise bills."" The report claimed Zynex engaged in an ""oversupplying scheme"" by sending inordinate amounts of monthly supplies like electrode pads and batteries in order to ""bill insurers for thousands of dollars more than it otherwise could."" The report further revealed that, as a result of this practice, insurers were ""kicking the company out of network.""

On this news, Zynex's stock price fell $0.50 per share, or 5%, to close at $9.35 per share on June 4, 2024, on unusually heavy trading volume.

On March 11, 2025, after the market closed, Zynex reported its fourth quarter and full year 2024 financial results, revealing a significant revenue ""shortfall"" in the quarter ""due to slower than normal payments from certain payers."" Zynex further revealed ""Tricare has temporarily suspended payments as they review prior claims."" Tricare is the health insurance program for the U.S. military.

On this news, Zynex's stock price fell $3.59 per share, or 51.3%, to close at $3.41 per share on March 12, 2025, on unusually heavy trading volume.

The court-appointed lead plaintiff is the investor with the largest financial interest in the relief sought by the class who is adequate and typical of class members who directs and oversees the litigation on behalf of the putative class. Any member of the putative class may move the Court to serve as lead plaintiff through counsel of their choice, or may choose to do nothing and remain an absent class member. Your ability to share in any recovery is not affected by the decision to serve as a lead plaintiff or not.

Faruqi & Faruqi, LLP also encourages anyone with information regarding Zynex's conduct to contact the firm, including whistleblowers, former employees, shareholders and others.

To learn more about the Zynex, Inc. class action, go to www.faruqilaw.com/ZYXI or call Faruqi & Faruqi partner Josh Wilson directly at 877-247-4292 or 212-983-9330 (Ext. 1310).

This is a success story.” That’s Dan Cnossen, a seven-time Paralympic medalist, former Navy SEAL and keynote speaker at the 2025 Military Health System Conference in Cleveland, Ohio.
“It’s steep, it’s too dark, it’s too rocky.
Speaking on how Ferrara saved his life, Cnossen said, “I owe him more than I can say.
Unparalleled Care, Perspective, and Focus Recalling his experience under the compassionate care of the doctors and nurses throughout the MHS, Cnossen wouldn’t have wanted to receive care anywhere else.","“Your mission is vital. I think you're going to see in my story that I'm alive here, up on this really high platform, because of the Military Health System. This is a success story.”

That’s Dan Cnossen, a seven-time Paralympic medalist, former Navy SEAL and keynote speaker at the 2025 Military Health System Conference in Cleveland, Ohio.

Cnossen delivered his powerful story of perseverance and overcoming extraordinary challenges to nearly 2,000 conference participants, inspiring the audience with his captivating ability to set goals and shift perspective—even when it feels impossible.

In September 2009, Cnossen led a platoon in Taliban-controlled Helmand Province in Afghanistan. As he and his team moved into position on top of a hill overlooking the platoon’s target compound, everything changed in a flash of an instant.

“We got to the designated point and proceeded up the hill. It was about a 20-minute walk. We got to the top. I remember taking a step, and cautiously taking another step. I paused. Next thing I know, I saw a flash of light under my goggles,” he said.

Cnossen stepped on an improvised explosive device. “I needed my teammates. I remember feeling a rising sense of internal panic. I couldn’t do anything,” he said.

The details, he recalls, are few and far between. “It’s steep, it’s too dark, it’s too rocky. I remember landing on sharp rocks. It was slow and damaging to my body. [My team] dragged me by shoulder straps, rocks cutting into my body like knives. The medic was telling me to stay awake. That was my personal fight. I lack the words to describe this experience in detail. But for my teammates, it’s very tiring to do a body drag. It’s like a 60-second sprint.”

‘I Owe Him More Than I can Say’

As his teammate dragged him down the hill and into a helicopter, Cnossen blacked out. Thanks to the fast action of his team in Helmand, Cnossen was airlifted to Kandahar where a team of U.S. military doctors were ready to act. One of those doctors was Dr. Stephen Ferrara, now the acting assistant secretary of defense for health affairs.

Eleven days later, Cnossen awoke from a medically induced coma at Bethesda Naval Hospital in Maryland, now known as Walter Reed National Military Medical Center. His legs were gone, but he was alive.

Speaking on how Ferrara saved his life, Cnossen said, “I owe him more than I can say. He could have gone anywhere in the world to serve, but he accepted the call to serve in Afghanistan.”

A National Hero

A testament to his character, Cnossen recalls the worst part of his experience. Even after losing his legs, shattering his pelvis, and enduring seven-to-10 hours of painful surgeries week after week throughout his two-year recovery, the worse thing, he said, was “dealing with lying in an ICU bed, stuck. The platoon is going to deploy. I’m not there to share the risk. I’m here in this bed and I cannot get out. That was corrosive.”

Cnossen’s inspirational character and commitment to his team and mission were not lost on Ferrara. “We have a national hero and all-around amazing person here. A true American hero in every sense of the word,” said Ferrara of Cnossen during his opening remarks at the conference.

Enduring two years of pain, rehabilitation, and emotional distress, Cnossen did not give up. He made a conscious effort to change his mindset and overcome what many would consider unbearable.

""There’s this notion of perspective,” he said. “The way you look at a moment, there are many angles to look at a scenario. Ultimately, I had to look at the totality of the situation. Challenge yourself—there’s at least one good thing to find. My arms could work. My legs were long enough for prosthetics. My limbs were long enough. Maybe, I’ll get to run. That’s another thing I can look forward to. That was motivating.”

Bringing humor to his story, Cnossen shared that, as a double leg amputee, he would finally be over six feet tall. “Humor can really help,” he said.

Unparalleled Care, Perspective, and Focus

Recalling his experience under the compassionate care of the doctors and nurses throughout the MHS, Cnossen wouldn’t have wanted to receive care anywhere else. “All this care I was getting, this is the best place to be. The prosthetics I’m going to get, they’re the best. There’s no better place to be in this condition,” he said.

By intentionally shifting his perspective and focus, Cnossen found a path forward, first in rehabilitation at WRNMMC and eventually as a Paralympic athlete representing Team USA. He shifted his focus from what was lost to what remained: his functioning arms, his gratitude, and his life. This generated psychological momentum, driving him toward recovery and eventually, athletic excellence.

He also focused on making small steps: getting out of bed, meeting visitors, getting his wheelchair and eventually prosthetics, and just making it through the day. This gave him renewed purpose.

“That bomb in Afghanistan took my legs. Ultimately, it had to be up to me if it would take my life,” he said.

Cnossen was awarded a Purple Heart and a Bronze Star with Valor from the Secretary of the Navy. He is currently training to compete with Team USA in the 2026 Paralympic Games.

His captivating speech kicked off the four-day annual MHS Conference, hosted by the Office of the Assistant Secretary of Defense for Health Affairs, which convened to share knowledge, advance innovation, and highlight new initiatives within the MHS. In his closing remarks on May 1, Dr. Ferrara emphasized the quality of the stories and information shared to improve the health care of the warfighter, saying the conference was “moving and inspiring, and helped bring us back to the center of what the nature of our mission is all about.”",https://d1ldvf68ux039x.cloudfront.net/thumbs/photos/2504/9004779/1000w_q95.jpg,N,1.0,2025-05-16 12:56:25.340847

Tricare dental pays a percentage of the total cost of the work you're having done. Depending on the type of work the percentage will change. The percentage is also different depending on in network or out of network dentist.

You can search for an in-network dentist using the Tricare dental portal. It'll also show you a chart of the percentages that they cover for the different types of work being done.

Yea, dental and eye care are separate here in the US. Most insurance companies require you to sign up for each plan, separately, including tricare.

So one, make sure you’re enrolled!

Two, it should be easy to find care if you’re in a military town (town with a large base) as most places will advertise in large lettering TRICARE ACCEPTED on a sign outside their business. Otherwise going to MilConnect can help u find dentists that are in network. Also we just called down to the closest one (we can walk to it) and asked them if they took tricare. He’s been our dentist for years now. Millconnect will use your DEERS login. Calling the tricare west or tricare east line is also helpful as the wait isn’t long but I wouldn’t recommend them to find care. Only to change PCM. I find calling dentists and just asking to be the easiest. I used to work in medical reception and that was our most common call. If we took their insurance. So it’s completely normal and they’ll know the answer. And in the US, all insurance companies work with various practitioners so regardless of your insurance if you want them to cover you have to be seen “in-network” so practices are used to getting asked what insurance that take. It’s also why they advertise! Best wishes!",,N,0.0,2025-05-16 11:56:16.887921
