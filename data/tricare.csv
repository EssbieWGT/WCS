All this happened on a platform that, since Elon Musk acquired it in 2022, has lost one fifth of its daily active users in the United States.","Elon Musk's public image has shifted from being admired to being surrounded by constant controversies. His reputation as a visionary leader in the technology and electric car industries has taken a serious hit in recent times. While Tesla faces an economic crisis and a loss of trust, Musk has starred in a new controversial episode, this time directed at Laurene Powell Jobs, widow of Apple co-founder Steve Jobs.

Tesla at a Low Point and Musk Under Pressure

Musk's company, Tesla, is experiencing one of its worst moments in the United States: sales have dropped significantly and investors are showing distrust. Some Tesla car owners have even reacted by putting stickers on their vehicles apologizing for having bought the car ""before Elon went crazy."" The stock value has fallen, and the company is facing serious problems, with government contracts that could be lost.

Meanwhile, Musk seems more focused on his personal and political controversies than on saving his company. This decline has been accompanied by a drop in Musk's public image. What was once seen as brilliance and innovation is now criticized as erratic and confrontational, earning the dislike of many sectors of society.

The Confrontation with Steve Jobs's Widow

The most recent episode involving Musk came after the publication of an article in The Atlantic, owned by Laurene Powell Jobs, Steve Jobs's widow. Powell described Musk's time at the White House as a disaster. In response, Musk harshly attacked Laurene, stating that ""Steve would be very disappointed.""

But it didn't stop there. He used his new name on the social network X, ""Kekius Maximus,"" and an AI-caused image emulating a Roman centurion, launching a digital war full of sarcasm and mocking emojis. The situation became even more surreal when Elon Musk joked with users that Steve Jobs's ghost should ""haunt"" his widow from the grave.

All this happened on a platform that, since Elon Musk acquired it in 2022, has lost one fifth of its daily active users in the United States. By contrast, The Atlantic, led by Powell, increased subscribers, surpassing 1M last year.

A Fall from Grace and the Loss of Allies

The article that irritated Musk portrays his time at the White House as a failure, where he ended up isolated and at odds with key figures in the current U.S. government. It recounts a scene in which the Treasury Secretary shouted ""Fuck you!"" several times in the presence of former President Trump. This anecdote reflects the difficult political and personal situation of the magnate.

To make matters worse, Musk showed controversial behavior in a recent interview with Bloomberg, where he called journalist Mishal Husain an ""NPC"" for questions he considered standard. ""NPC"" refers to a non-playable character that appears in video games and is not controlled by a player, but by the game's system itself. These actions reflect a lack of self-criticism that has caused confusion and rejection among the public and the media.",https://elcierredigital.com/filesedc/uploads/image/post/sanchez-aragones-1_1200_800.webp,N,0.0,2025-05-31 15:56:21.288724

The combined benefit allows people who already receive Social Security payments, such as Supplemental Security Income (SSI), to also access other benefits.
Pay Attention to This from US Social Security: What Is the Combined Benefit Both programs are administered by the federal government and can be applied for simultaneously without one affecting the other.
Additionally, in some states such as California and Alaska, additional stimulus checks have been implemented to support residents.
For example, in California, the Sacramento Family First program offers monthly payments of $725 to families that meet certain income criteria.","A recent news story has caused excitement among many families in the United States. The possibility of receiving a combined benefit that merges Social Security payments with those from the SNAP program represents significant financial relief for those facing economic hardship.

The combined benefit allows people who already receive Social Security payments, such as Supplemental Security Income (SSI), to also access other benefits. This refers to the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP), known for providing food coupons.

Pay Attention to This from US Social Security: What Is the Combined Benefit

Both programs are administered by the federal government and can be applied for simultaneously without one affecting the other. To qualify, it is necessary to meet certain requirements. Gross monthly income must be below the established limits, which vary depending on household size.

For example, for a household of four people, the limit is $3,250. In some states, there are limits on the amount of assets a family can have to be eligible, and these generally range between $3,000 and $5,000.

Adults between 18 and 54 years old without dependents must work or participate in training programs at least 80 hours per month to receive benefits for more than three months in a three-year period. There are exceptions for people with disabilities, pregnant women, veterans, and other specific groups.

This Is How You Can Apply for Benefits: Take Note

The process to apply for SNAP varies by state, but generally includes completing an application. This can be done online, by mail, or in person at the local SNAP office.

After submitting the application, an interview is conducted, which can be by phone or in person. Evidence of identity, income, expenses, and immigration status, if applicable, is required. Once approved, an EBT card is received, which can be used to purchase food at authorized establishments.

Why Is This Double Payment So Important?

Assistance from the SSA through these programs is crucial for many families. SNAP provides assistance for purchasing food, while SSI offers financial support to older adults or people with disabilities. The combination of both benefits can make a significant difference in the well-being of low-income households.

Additionally, in some states such as California and Alaska, additional stimulus checks have been implemented to support residents. For example, in California, the Sacramento Family First program offers monthly payments of $725 to families that meet certain income criteria.",https://elcierredigital.com/filesedc/uploads/image/post/montaje-de-fotos-persona-sorprendida-dolares-de-fondo_1200_800.webp,N,0.0,2025-05-31 13:56:23.579532

This is the tax relief program known as the ""Anti-Displacement Tax Relief Fund,"" promoted by Invest Atlanta. This aims to ease the property tax burden for the most vulnerable homeowners.

SSA knows that many Americans need this relief: Pay attention if you live in this state

This program's main goal is to help homeowners in Atlanta face the increase in property taxes. This increase has been driven by the growth and revaluation of properties in the city.

With a $10M fund, financed in part by the Centennial Yards Housing Trust Fund, the program will cover any increase in property taxes above a set base over a period of 20 years for qualifying applicants.

Who can apply in Atlanta? SSA makes it clear

To be eligible for this program, applicants must meet the following requirements. For example, they must be at least 60 years old as of May 1, 2025, and have been the owner and resident of a home in the city of Atlanta since 2015.

Applicants must be actively enrolled in the city and county homestead exemption programs and have a clear property title, free of liens. In addition, they must not have any unsolved property tax appeals with the city at the close of the application period. The total household income must also be equal to or less than 60% of the Area Median Income (AMI).

According to SSA, applications for the program are open until today, May 31, 2025. It is crucial for interested parties to submit their application before the deadline, as no applications will be accepted after this period.

How to apply? A truly significant relief for these residents

Interested parties can submit their application online through Invest Atlanta's official platform. In addition, informational sessions have been organized to help applicants understand the process and program requirements.

With Atlanta's rapid growth and development, many long-term residents, especially older adults, face the threat of being displaced. This is all due to the increase in housing costs and property taxes. This program aims to provide significant relief to these residents, ensuring that they can remain in their homes and communities.",https://elcierredigital.com/filesedc/uploads/image/post/imagen-donald-trump-aguantando-dinero-manos-cartel-seguridad-social_1200_800.webp,N,0.0,2025-05-31 13:56:32.265684

Unlock your health by taking that first step—because mental health care is health care.","MAY 31, 2025 – Mental health is a vital part of your overall well-being. Whether you’re having difficulty managing day-to-day stress or navigating more complex challenges, TRICARE offers mental health support when—and where—you need it.

“Getting care early is just like preventive medicine, such as labs or regular checkups,” said Jeannine Pickrell, director for Population Health and Disease Management, TRICARE Health Plan, at the Defense Health Agency. “You can prevent smaller issues from becoming big ones by checking in with yourself through a TRICARE mental health provider. TRICARE offers a variety of ways to find and get the care you need.”

More than ever, people recognize the importance of mental well-being. Unlock your health by understanding how to access care based on your TRICARE plan.

Ways to access care

TRICARE has options for different mental health needs. Services are available whether you’re seeking support for the short or long term. Depending on your health plan, you may need a referral or pre-authorization.

You can start by:

Talking to your primary care manager

Reaching out directly to a TRICARE-authorized provider

Exploring virtual health options to speak with a provider from home

Not sure what applies to you? Check with your TRICARE contractor.

Covered mental health services

As described in the Mental Health and Substance Use Disorder Services Fact Sheet, TRICARE covers services can include:

Outpatient counseling like individual, group, or family therapy

Intensive outpatient programs that meet throughout the week

Partial hospitalization programs that meet throughout the week

Inpatient care at a hospital or other facility

Are virtual health services a better fit for you? TRICARE covers many virtual options for getting mental health care from your own home. Options include telemental health services through virtual-only providers, as well as local providers who may offer a combination of in-person and virtual health services.

How you access them is specific to your region:

East Region: The East Region contractor, Humana Military, offers services through Doctor on Demand, Teladoc, Telamynd, and Talkspace, as well as other smaller provider groups.

West Region: The West Region contractor, TriWest Healthcare Alliance, offers services through Doctor on Demand, Teladoc, Telemynd, Skytherapist, Fusion Care Group, NVelUp, Open Mind Health, Talkspace, and Veterans Room, as well as other smaller provider groups.

Overseas: If you’re overseas, the country where you live must allow virtual health services. Your provider must be licensed to practice where you live. Contact your TRICARE Overseas Regional Call Center for more information, including eligibility of providers. Visit the Overseas virtual health page to learn more about the overseas requirements.

However, there may be limitations on these services in certain areas to include Medication-assisted treatment, substance use disorder, and applied behavior analysis services may not be included.

To request telemental health services:

Use the Find a Doctor tool to search your regional contractor’s network provider directory.

Contact your regional contractor. You can learn more about the options available to you based on who you are and where you live.

Types of mental health care

TRICARE provides mental health coverage for all eligible beneficiaries. How you access them depends on your health plan, category, and whether care is immediate or ongoing.

Emergency mental health care

If you or someone you know is at immediate risk of self-harm, or harm to others, this is a medical emergency. Emergency mental health care doesn’t require a referral. You should:

Call 911 or go to the nearest emergency room.

Your TRICARE regional contractor should be contacted within 24 hours or next day, if admitted.

You can also call the Veterans Crisis Line:

Call 988, option 1.

Text 838255.

Chat online.

Again, if you or a loved one is in danger or needs urgent support, go to the nearest emergency room or call 911.

Nonemergency mental health care

You don’t need to be in crisis to seek help. TRICARE covers a range of mental health services. How you access them depends on your beneficiary group.

Here’s how it works:

Active duty service members

Care must begin at a military hospital or clinic, or a TRICARE-authorized provider for those enrolled in TRICARE Prime Remote.

ADSMs may also request an evaluation from their supervisor without providing a reason. These are confidential and protected. This is part of the Brandon Act implementation, which aims to reduce the stigma of seeking mental health care.

Referrals and pre-authorizations are required outside military hospitals or clinics.

All other TRICARE beneficiaries

Do you have TRICARE Prime?

You don’t need a referral if you see a TRICARE network provider.

Beyond basic outpatient care, a referral may be required.

Start with your PCM if you’re unsure what you need.

Do you have TRICARE Select?

You can visit any TRICARE-authorized provider for mental health services.

Referrals aren’t required, but you’ll pay lower out-of-pocket costs by choosing a network provider.

You don’t need a pre-authorization for routine care, but some specialty services may require one.

Do you have TRICARE For Life?

You should see a Medicare provider. Follow Medicare’s rules for mental health care until those benefits are exhausted.

Medicare is your primary payer. TRICARE is secondary.

If Medicare benefits are exhausted, you’ll need a referral and pre-authorization from TRICARE before you get care.

Are you a National Guard and Reserve member or family member?

Your eligibility and TRICARE coverage depend on the National Guard or Reserve member’s duty status. You should contact your unit’s personnel office with eligibility questions. You can review your eligibility in milConnect. When getting care, seeing a TRICARE network provider can reduce your costs. If you’re on active duty orders for:

More than 30 days: You’re eligible. You receive the same benefits as ADSMs.

30 days or less: You may be eligible to enroll in TRICARE Reserve Select.

Do you have a TRICARE health plan overseas?

Availability varies by location and some services may be limited. Contact the TRICARE Overseas contractor for help finding what is right for you.

Other resources include:

The Psychological Health Resource Center (866-966-1020) for community resources

The Military Health System Nurse Advice Line (800-874-2273, option 1) for mental health questions

Military OneSource (800-342-9647) for non-medical counseling services

Unit or military chaplains for non-medical support

U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs or VetCenter for eligible veterans

Taking the first step

When it comes to mental health challenges—or maintaining good mental health—you’re not alone. It’s okay to reach out to find the services right for you, and TRICARE has your back every step of the way.

During the pre-COVID-19 period, 19.1% of ADSW had at least one mental disorder diagnosis compared to only 16.3% of ADSW during the COVID-19 period.

Results: We identified a total of 325,147 ADSW from October 2016 to February 2020 and a total of 305,626 ADSW from March 2020 to September 2022. During the pre-COVID-19 period, 19.1% of ADSW had at least one mental disorder diagnosis compared to only 16.3% of ADSW during the COVID-19 period. Adjusted regression analyses revealed that non-Hispanic Black, Hispanic, and Asian/Pacific Islander ADSW are less likely to have a mental disorder diagnosis compared to non-Hispanic White ADSW; however, interaction testing revealed a significant interaction between race/ethnicity and rank, resulting in higher odds of a mental disorder diagnosis across all ranks, excluding ""other"" rank, among non-Hispanic Black and Hispanic ADSW, and higher odds in Asian/Pacific Islander and American Indian/Alaska Native ADSW in enlisted ranks.

It was on the occasion of the recent school graduation of Infanta Sofía. On this very special occasion, to the surprise of many, the snapshots shared by Casa Real reveal an unknown and endearing aspect of Leonor and her sister's life.

Queen Letizia, just like her sister Telma, was an excellent ballet student during her childhood in Oviedo. Both were trained from an early age in this artistic discipline that requires perseverance, effort, and a remarkable ability to concentrate.

Those dance classes, beyond being merely an extracurricular activity, deeply shaped their way of facing life, cultivating values such as perfectionism and self-discipline.

Casa Real confirms the big news about Princess Leonor

Now, those lessons seem to have transcended generations. One of the photographs released by Zarzuela has especially caught the public's attention.

In it, Princess Leonor and Infanta Sofía appear hugging, dressed in identical leotards and ruffled skirts, both with impeccable tight buns and a light touch of makeup. The image, apparently captured before or after a school performance, shows not only their involvement in the activity but also the shared excitement of Leonor and Sofía.

Despite the age difference between them, two years, Leonor and Sofía wear the same outfit. This reinforces the idea that it is a joint performance, probably part of their extracurricular training. This image has been interpreted as a clear confirmation that the young royals have inherited the same passion for ballet as their mother.

Casa Real wants Leonor to be closer to the citizens

Casa Real hasn't issued a formal statement about this lovely hobby, but the gesture of sharing such a meaningful image hasn't gone unnoticed. At a time when the Royal Family is committed to closeness, showing Leonor's more human side helps strengthen the emotional bond between the public and the future queen.

Thus, Princess Leonor stands out not only for her military training or her impeccable institutional agenda, but also for an artistic sensitivity that connects with her maternal lineage. A detail that, without a doubt, adds a new dimension to her public figure and proves that in Zarzuela, passions that shape the soul, not just the crown, are also cultivated.",https://elcierredigital.com/filesedc/uploads/image/post/montaje-primer-plano-princesa-leonor-infanta-sofia-desenfocadas-camara-emoji-sorpresa_1200_800.webp,N,0.0,2025-05-31 07:56:20.516816

A brand with a long history and known for its sliders has decided to reclaim the spotlight. After years without opening new locations, Krystal announces an ambitious plan to launch more than 200 stores across the United States in the coming years.

The Return of an Iconic Brand

Krystal, founded in Tennessee in 1932, is famous for its small sliders and chili cheese pups. Its name was popularized by celebrities such as Elvis Presley, Jimmy Carter, and Ronald Reagan, who enjoyed its products. However, in the last decade, the chain was stagnant, with no new openings.

The reactivation began with the opening of a store in Tyler, Texas, on April 15. This store is Krystal's first to open 24 hours and is located inside a travel center, a strategic location to attract high-traffic customers. This launch marks only the beginning of an expansion that will lead the brand to open hundreds of new stores.

Strategy to Grow with Nostalgia and Modernity

The franchisee Highway 31 Food Service, responsible for the Tyler store, has plans to open more restaurants in Texas. Their vision is clear: to leverage the nostalgia that Krystal generates among customers, but with a format adapted to current times. The combination of convenience, accessibility, and a steady flow of visitors is the core of their model.

Despite having had a complicated path, the company has managed to reinvent itself. In January 2020, Krystal faced serious financial problems and filed for bankruptcy with a debt close to $100 million. However, after its acquisition by Fortress Investment Group, parent company of SPB Hospitality, its situation improved significantly.

Renewal and Competition in the Sector

Since changing hands, Krystal has improved its sales and doesn't plan to close stores. While many large chains have reduced their number of locations, Krystal is betting on transformation and sustained expansion. Part of that renewal includes modernizing its restaurants, with digital menus and improvements in drive-thru services.

Thus, the chain seeks not only to attract its loyal customers as always, but also new generations who seek speed and convenience. This resurgence marks a new stage for Krystal and presents a clear challenge to giants such as Burger King. The story of this iconic burger chain is far from over and promises to keep making headlines in the U.S. market.",https://elcierredigital.com/filesedc/uploads/image/post/montaje-exterior-restaurante-burger-king-chico-sorprendido_1200_800.webp,N,0.0,2025-05-31 05:56:23.036503

In November 2018, both families gathered in A Coruña to attend the wedding of Marta Ortega and Carlos Torretta.
The Origins of Carmen Echevarría, Marta Ortega's Mother-in-Law Carmen Echevarría was born in 1950 into a family settled in Oviedo.","Zara has commemorated the 50th anniversary (50th) of the opening of its first store in A Coruña. This is a very special anniversary for Inditex, which has placed the Ortega Pérez clan in the spotlight. Meanwhile, behind them, the Torretta family has ""reigned"" in the shadows since 2018, whose matriarch is Carmen Echevarría (Oviedo, 1950), the mother-in-law of Marta Ortega.

People say that Carmen is a key figure in the life of Inditex's non-executive chairwoman. She also plays an important role in the company her husband, designer Roberto Torretta, launched in 1996. But what role does Carmen Echevarría really play in Marta Ortega's life? What are her origins?

The ""Other Pillar"" of Inditex: Her Relationship With Marta Ortega

In 2017, businesswoman Carmen Echevarría made headlines nationwide. That year, her son, Carlos Torretta, and Marta Ortega, then the ""heiress"" of the Inditex empire, announced their engagement.

Until that moment, Carmen had been a very discreet figure in the glossy magazines despite being the ""matriarch"" of the Torretta family, one of the most renowned dynasties in international fashion.

Carlos and Marta's relationship was in the media spotlight from the beginning. However, people say that Carmen advised her son to keep a low profile. This is because Carmen is said to have had a significant influence on him since his childhood.

In November 2018, both families gathered in A Coruña to attend the wedding of Marta Ortega and Carlos Torretta. Carmen acted as the matron of honor and showed off her remarkable elegance, dressed in a black outfit, her signature color.

Since then, there has been much speculation about the relationship the Asturian businesswoman keeps with the Ortega Pérez family. Meanwhile, in particular, with her daughter-in-law Marta Ortega.

Apparently, the two are very close and they have shown it over the years at events such as equestrian days where the Torretta and Ortega Pérez families gather.

Marta and Carmen share a passion for fashion. Currently, the Asturian plays a key role in Roberto Torretta's company, where she works in the commercial department.

Together with her husband, she forms an iconic professional partnership and enjoys a life away from the spotlight in their exclusive villa in Torrelodones. Beyond business, Carmen is also delighted with her new role as grandmother to Matilda and Manuel, Carlos Torretta's children, and the three daughters of María Torretta.

The Origins of Carmen Echevarría, Marta Ortega's Mother-in-Law

Carmen Echevarría was born in 1950 into a family settled in Oviedo. She is very close to her sister Conchita, about whom little is known regarding her personal life.

The Asturian capital was where Carmen spent her childhood and adolescence, during which she studied economics. However, her destiny would take a different path.

The ""Matriarch"" of the Torretta Family

In the mid-seventies, Spain witnessed a process of opening up on all levels. The Transition had come to stay, and in 1977, Carmen Echevarría's life took a radical turn.

That year, the Oviedo native spent her summer vacation in Ibiza with her family. At that time, the Pityusic island was a true hippie paradise, where a young Argentine named Roberto Torretta arrived, making a living by selling pants on the island.

A spark ignited between them that culminated in 1981 when they decided to take their relationship a step further and got married. The couple chose the Pacha nightclub, one of the trendiest spots in Ibiza, to seal their story. They returned there years later to celebrate their silver wedding anniversary.

After getting married, Carmen Echevarría and Roberto Torretta settled in Madrid. The couple bought a house on the central Barquillo street. Both began to make their way in the fashion industry, which was booming at the time.

Carmen joined the team at the Loewe store on Serrano street. Later, she decided to open a costume jewelry boutique on the same street where she lived.

The Asturian's name began to resonate strongly in high society and fashion circles after the opening of Berlín, a multi-brand store where Roberto Torretta began selling garments from Snif, the first brand the Argentine launched on the market.

The opening of Berlín revolutionized fashion in Madrid. Carmen introduced new brands such as the exclusive Tod's, and her client list included personalities like socialite Marta Chávarri, Infanta Elena, or members of well-known dynasties such as the Martínez-Bordiú family.

Carlos and María Torretta, the couple's two children, grew up among fabrics and designs. Carlos was born in 1984 and María in 1986.

For Carmen, her children have been the most important thing in her life. In an interview, María Torretta confessed: ""My mother has made both my brother Carlos and me who we are.""

Both Carlos and María are very close to their parents and, since childhood, they have witnessed their effort and sacrifice.

Her Friendship With Massiel

Since settling in the Spanish capital, Roberto Torretta and Carmen Echevarría have always attended the major ""parties"" and premieres that brought together figures from the worlds of culture, politics, or music.

According to reports, Carmen Echevarría's circle includes names such as former politician Ana Botella and singer Massiel, whose friendship dates back to their childhood.

Massiel and Carmen met in Asturias. The ""Tanqueta de Leganitos"" spent much of her childhood between Gijón and Oviedo, as her parents, Emilio Santamaría and Concepción Espinosa, were Asturian.

The two became very close, and in fact, Massiel played a key role in Carmen's early business ventures in Madrid. The singer partnered with the Asturian in opening the jewelry boutique in the heart of Chueca (Madrid).

However, the business did not continue, but their friendship endured. So much so that Carmen and Roberto chose the Madrid-born singer as godmother for their daughter María's baptism.",https://elcierredigital.com/filesedc/uploads/image/post/captura-de-pantalla-2025-05-29-a-las-164447_1200_800.webp,N,0.0,2025-05-31 01:56:18.231301

Even with his positive attitude, the fight against cancer hasn't been free of difficulties. On March 27, Charles III was hospitalized due to complications from his treatment, which forced him to cancel several official engagements and caused concern among the public.

However, sources close to the king's circle confirmed that his recovery has been gradual and favorable. A few days after his hospital admission, the monarch reappeared in public, dispelling the most alarming rumors about his condition. His presence proved that, although the illness is a challenge, Charles III keeps the strength needed to continue with his life and his duties.

This combination of personal strength and institutional commitment has been key for the British monarch to face this chapter of his life with complete dignity and responsibility. His example has served to inspire many people who are going through similar situations.",https://elcierredigital.com/filesedc/uploads/image/post/montaje-primer-plano-carlos-iii-traje-azul-alarma_1200_800.webp,N,0.0,2025-05-30 21:56:18.490397

So even if you pay out of pocket, you still have Tricare. They likely won’t work with people on any government insurance to avoid any conflicts with government regulations (which are pretty in-depth) Because even if you are choosing not to bill Tricare you still fall under the regulations that Tricare has.

There is always a possibility that a person still manually submits a claim even if they don’t so it’s easier for them to just deny services altogether.

We're caught in a squeeze between insurance providers and the medical industry. Each is doing what ever they can to maximize their profits. Medical is charging as much as possible (Tricare limits what they can charge as another poster said) while insurance is denying as much as possible. The result is medical is disconnecting themselves from Tricare completely (it's better to make no money than to lose money) while Tricare will soon be bombarded by congressional inquires. Once Tricare is force to speak to congress, they will explain how the annual fees and copays are too low and need to be raised to continue to operate. They will also take the opportunity to scale back coverages further reducing their liability. Next, congress will agree to allow Tricare to raise annual fees and copays. Things will get better for some time but in 2 or 3 years we'll do this dance again. There's only 3 ways to solve this, first you can forgo your health and die, second you can forgo your insurance and pay cash for service, third you can vote for congressional / presidential representatives who are supportive of a national health plan based on annual income and completely dismantle the medical insurance companies.

The agency is demanding the return of $69,087.50 for overpayments related to benefits her late husband, Ed, received before passing away in 2012 due to leukemia. According to Podmanik, her husband Ed had repeatedly informed SSA that he had returned to work, but the agency kept sending him benefits.

Pensioner is forced to return nearly $70,000 to US SSA: she's outraged

Years later, upon retiring and beginning to claim the benefits corresponding to her husband, Ruth was informed that she had to return the full amount. Amid fears of losing her home, she emphasizes that the error was SSA's and not hers or her husband's.

This case has caused outrage and has exposed SSA's practices regarding the recovery of overpayments. The agency has been criticized for the measures they take against beneficiaries who received improper payments, many of whom are not at fault and can't afford to return the money. Recently, SSA announced actions to address the problem of overpayments and the associated injustices.

This may not be enough for people like Ruth Podmanik

Among the measures adopted, the SSA has reduced the automatic overpayment recovery rate to 10% of the monthly benefit, instead of the 100% that was previously applied. In addition, the agency has made it easier to request recovery waivers for those who are not at fault or can't return the money.

However, these measures may not be enough for people like Ruth Podmanik, who are facing significant debts due to administrative errors. SSA has stated that they are working to ensure that their overpayment recovery policies are fair and equitable, and that they do not unduly harm beneficiaries.

The Ohio pensioner still trusts SSA will acknowledge their error

Ruth's case has drawn media attention and sparked a debate about SSA's responsibility in managing benefits. Many are questioning how it is possible that administrative errors can have such serious consequences for people who depend on these benefits to survive.

Meanwhile, Ruth Podmanik is waiting for a favorable resolution to her situation.

Mental health is a vital part of your overall well-being. Whether you’re having difficulty managing day-to-day stress or navigating more complex challenges, TRICARE offers mental health support when — and where — you need it.

“Getting care early is just like preventive medicine, such as labs or regular checkups,” said Jeannine Pickrell, director for Population Health and Disease Management, TRICARE Health Plan, at the Defense Health Agency. “You can prevent smaller issues from becoming big ones by checking in with yourself through a TRICARE mental health provider. TRICARE offers a variety of ways to find and get the care you need.”

More than ever, people recognize the importance of mental well-being. Unlock your health by understanding how to access care based on your TRICARE plan.

Ways to access care

TRICARE has options for different mental health needs. Services are available whether you’re seeking support for the short or long term. Depending on your health plan, you may need a referral or pre-authorization.

You can start by:

Talking to your primary care manager

Reaching out directly to a TRICARE-authorized provider

Exploring virtual health options to speak with a provider from home

Not sure what applies to you? Check with your TRICARE contractor.

Covered mental health services

As described in the Mental Health and Substance Use Disorder Services Fact Sheet, TRICARE covers services can include:

Outpatient counseling like individual, group, or family therapy

Intensive outpatient programs that meet throughout the week

Partial hospitalization programs that meet throughout the week

Inpatient care at a hospital or other facility

Are virtual health services a better fit for you? TRICARE covers many virtual options for getting mental health care from your own home. Options include telemental health services through virtual-only providers, as well as local providers who may offer a combination of in-person and virtual health services.

How you access them is specific to your region:

East Region: The East Region contractor, Humana Military, offers services through Doctor on Demand, Teladoc, Telamynd, and Talkspace, as well as other smaller provider groups.

West Region: The West Region contractor, TriWest Healthcare Alliance, offers services through Doctor on Demand, Teladoc, Telemynd, Skytherapist, Fusion Care Group, NVelUp, Open Mind Health, Talkspace, and Veterans Room, as well as other smaller provider groups.

Overseas: If you’re overseas, the country where you live must allow virtual health services. Your provider must be licensed to practice where you live. Contact your TRICARE Overseas Regional Call Center for more information, including eligibility of providers. Visit the Overseas virtual health page to learn more about the overseas requirements.

However, there may be limitations on these services in certain areas to include Medication-assisted treatment, substance use disorder, and applied behavior analysis services may not be included.

To request telemental health services:

Use the Find a Doctor tool to search your regional contractor’s network provider directory.

Contact your regional contractor. You can learn more about the options available to you based on who you are and where you live.

Types of mental health care

TRICARE provides mental health coverage for all eligible beneficiaries. How you access them depends on your health plan, category, and whether care is immediate or ongoing.

Emergency mental health care

If you or someone you know is at immediate risk of self-harm, or harm to others, this is a medical emergency. Emergency mental health care doesn’t require a referral. You should:

Call 911 or go to the nearest emergency room.

Your TRICARE regional contractor should be contacted within 24 hours or next day, if admitted.

You can also call the Veterans Crisis Line:

Call 988, option 1.

Text 838255.

Chat online.

Again, if you or a loved one is in danger or needs urgent support, go to the nearest emergency room or call 911.

Nonemergency mental health care

You don’t need to be in crisis to seek help. TRICARE covers a range of mental health services. How you access them depends on your beneficiary group.

Here’s how it works:

Active duty service members

Care must begin at a military hospital or clinic, or a TRICARE-authorized provider for those enrolled in TRICARE Prime Remote.

ADSMs may also request an evaluation from their supervisor without providing a reason. These are confidential and protected. This is part of the Brandon Act implementation, which aims to reduce the stigma of seeking mental health care.

Referrals and pre-authorizations are required outside military hospitals or clinics.

All other TRICARE beneficiaries

Do you have TRICARE Prime?

You don’t need a referral if you see a TRICARE network provider.

Beyond basic outpatient care, a referral may be required.

Start with your PCM if you’re unsure what you need.

Do you have TRICARE Select?

You can visit any TRICARE-authorized provider for mental health services.

Referrals aren’t required, but you’ll pay lower out-of-pocket costs by choosing a network provider.

You don’t need a pre-authorization for routine care, but some specialty services may require one.

Do you have TRICARE For Life?

You should see a Medicare provider. Follow Medicare's rules for mental health care until those benefits are exhausted.

Medicare is your primary payer. TRICARE is secondary.

If Medicare benefits are exhausted, you’ll need a referral and pre-authorization from TRICARE before you get care.

Are you a National Guard and Reserve member or family member?

Your eligibility and TRICARE coverage depend on the National Guard or Reserve member’s duty status. You should contact your unit’s personnel office with eligibility questions. You can review your eligibility in milConnect. When getting care, seeing a TRICARE network provider can reduce your costs. If you’re on active duty orders for:

More than 30 days: You’re eligible. You receive the same benefits as ADSMs.

30 days or less: You may be eligible to enroll in TRICARE Reserve Select.

Do you have a TRICARE health plan overseas?

Availability varies by location and some services may be limited. Contact the TRICARE Overseas contractor for help finding what is right for you.

“This opportunity stems from the initiative and vision of Lt. Cmdr.","Naval Medical Center Camp Lejeune promotes a culture of excellence through building great people, leaders, and teams who exemplify clinical excellence, academic distinction, and outstanding leadership across all levels of professional practice.

Major recognition of that excellence came during the 2025 Military Health System Conference in Cleveland, Ohio when Navy Medicine announced that nurses from NMCCL were awarded the MHS Nursing Leadership Excellence Award in all three military categories. Awardees included Navy Cmdr. Reginald Middlebrooks as Senior Officer, Lt. Cmdr. Alainna Crotty as Midgrade Officer, and Lt. j.g. Jesse Brooks as Junior Officer.

According to award criteria, the MHS Nursing Leadership Excellence awards honors military nurses who have “demonstrated exemplary leadership skills and exceptional compassion and commitment to patients, colleagues, and the profession of nursing, resulting in noteworthy clinical or administrative accomplishments and contributing to the improved image and practice of nursing within the Military Health System.”

“Receiving the award is awesome, but it’s less of a reflection of what I did, and more a reflection on the leadership putting me in that position,” said Brooks. “In a culture like this one, I think setting the standard is important, and Cmdr. Middlebrooks and Lt. Cmdr. Crotty are different from other leaders; they engaged me, made suggestions… but in the end, let me make the decisions and run with it. I think that’s something to emulate, and it made an impression on me.”

Crotty mirrored his sentiments citing leadership engagement style as the reason for her success.

“Our culture here starts from our senior leaders who allow us to take the opportunities to drive enterprise level change,” said Lt. Cmdr. Alainna Crotty. “I am not given directives; they let me lead and gain experience that I need to move forward. They push us to jump on enterprise level initiatives that really put our names out [into the community].”

In addition to the awards, Middlebrooks, along with Cmdr. Sarah Louk, were selected as fellows in the University of Pennsylvania/Johnson & Johnson Nurse Innovation Fellowship – a first in NMCCL history.

“This opportunity stems from the initiative and vision of Lt. Cmdr. Alainna Crotty who led much of the groundwork behind our successful application,” said Middlebrooks. “This fellowship is designed to advance health care and drive transformative change within the organization.”

The fellowship is a combination of in-person and virtual sessions running through May 2026 and will allow the fellows to solve some of health care’s biggest challenges while maintaining an environment that fosters innovation within NMCCL.

“Camp Lejeune nurses are not only excelling within the walls of NMCCL but are also shaping policy, leading [Defense Health Agency]-level committees, and earning competitive research funding – securing over $200,000 in grants to advance evidence-based practice,” said Middlebrooks. “Each day, our nurses demonstrate a deep commitment to improving the care for our warfighters and beneficiaries. I believe the recent wave of recognition simply reflects a long-standing culture of excellence that our nurses have worked hard to build.”

(Tess Vrbin/Arkansas Advocate)

Two federal lawsuits filed Thursday argue that a new state law will harm hundreds of thousands of Arkansans by affecting access to needed medications.

Two of the country’s largest pharmacy benefit managers (PBMs) filed the complaints in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Arkansas, both arguing that Act 624 of 2025 violates the U.S. Constitution by interfering with interstate commerce. The suits also allege that federal law preempts state laws that affect employee health plans and Medicare coverage.

The suits filed by Express Scripts Inc. and CVS Pharmacy Inc. name the eight members of the Arkansas State Board of Pharmacy and its executive director as defendants. The new law empowers the pharmacy board to enforce its provisions.

Both complaints ask the court to bar enforcement of the law as well as declare it unconstitutional.

Act 624 “imperils the health” of 50,000 Arkansans who rely on Express Scripts for pharmacy benefits through their health insurance, the PBM’s complaint says.

The General Assembly created the law “for the exclusive benefit of Arkansas-based pharmacies who spearheaded the legislation in order to increase their market share by eliminating out-of-state competition,” the complaint states.

Health insurer Cigna owns Express Scripts; CVS Pharmacy owns the PBM Caremark Rx. Together with OptumRx, owned by United Healthcare, the PBMs manage 79% of prescription drug claims for approximately 270 million people, according to a 2024 Federal Trade Commission report.

Arkansas became the first state in the nation to ban large, vertically integrated healthcare companies from also operating drugstores in the state when Gov. Sarah Huckabee Sanders signed House Bill 1150 into law in mid-April. The law doesn’t take effect until January 2026.

“If left to stand, the law will have devastating consequences across Arkansas – including forcing numerous pharmacies operating in the state out of business, costing the more than 600 Arkansans employed at those pharmacies their jobs, and creating pharmacy ‘deserts’ for the nearly 40% of Arkansans who live in rural areas that often lack brick-and-mortar pharmacies,” Express Scripts asserts in its complaint.

“The law will also dangerously limit patient choice and deny access to lifesaving drugs at affordable prices by high-quality pharmacy providers. And it will create mass confusion among Arkansans about where and how they can receive needed prescription medications,” the suit adds.

In its complaint, CVS says that if the law takes effect on Jan. 1, the company “will have to cease not only its operations at 23 CVS retail pharmacies across the State, but also its mail-order and specialty-pharmacy services. Indeed, the law will likely shut down a substantial portion of all mail-order and specialty-pharmacy prescriptions flowing into the State because the majority of such providers are out-of-state pharmacies with PBM affiliations.”

The complaint notes that CVS’s 23 pharmacies served more than 340,000 patients and filled over 2.4 million prescriptions in 2024.

Complying with the law will impose undue burdens on CVS because of the intricacies of its corporate structure, the complaint says. CVS further claims the law already has begun affecting its business, as it has lost patients to in-state competitors and it’s become harder to attract and retain employees in Arkansas.

The CVS complaint calls Act 624 “a blatantly protectionist measure,” a characterization echoed in Express Script’s argument for a court-ordered injunction: “Because Act 624 is unconstitutionally protectionist, unconstitutionally punitive, and preempted by federal law, enforcement of the statute must be enjoined.”

Both lawsuits argue that the Arkansas law violates various commerce provisions of the Constitution, and CVS argues that it violates the equal protection clause by banning CVS and most other PBM-affiliated pharmacies from Arkansas while exempting “the only Arkansas-based pharmacy affiliated with a PBM [Walmart], without a rational justification for this distinction.”

Express Script’s complaint also notes that Act 624 will adversely affect members of the military, their families and veterans because the PBM is the primary mail-order pharmacy provider for Tricare, the military’s health insurance program.

The law allows the state pharmacy board to issue limited permits to PBMs if they provide “drugs that are otherwise unavailable in the market to a patient or a pharmacy that would otherwise be prohibited” under the law. Republican Sen. Kim Hammer of Benton, the law’s co-sponsor, told the Senate this will allow Tricare beneficiaries to continue receiving medications while PBMs transition out of Arkansas.

Attorney General Tim Griffin said in a statement that “Arkansas is standing up to PBMs on behalf of consumers” via Act 624 and vowed to defend the law.

“Pharmacy benefit managers wield outsized power to reap massive profits at the expense of consumers. The rise of PBMs as middlemen in the prescription drug market has resulted in patients facing fewer choices, lower quality care, and higher prices. PBMs leverage their affiliated pharmacies to manipulate prices, corrupt the market, and destroy competition,” Griffin said, echoing many of the talking points of the law’s proponents as it made its way through the Legislature.

Shortly before Act 624 became law, Griffin was the lead signatory of a bipartisan letter to Congress from attorneys general in 39 states and territories, advocating for the policy in Act 624 to be enacted federally.

My Social Security benefits will not pay for my mandatory Medicare because I can’t start collecting full Social Security benefits until I’m 67!
And, since you are not yet collecting Social Security, you will be required to separately pay the Medicare Part B premium directly to Medicare (they will bill you when you enroll in Medicare).
So, is it unfair that you must pay for Medicare Part B before you are collecting Social Security?
You can visit this site to see how to pay your Medicare premiums until it is later deducted from your Social Security payment: www.medicare.gov/basics/costs/pay-premiums/online-bill-pay.","DEAR RUSTY: I’m a retired Navy veteran who is going to be turning 65 years old this year. My question is concerning mandatory Medicare sign-up requirements. Why do I have to sign up for Medicare coverage at 65 when I can’t start collecting full Social Security benefits until I turn 67? My Social Security benefits will not pay for my mandatory Medicare because I can’t start collecting full Social Security benefits until I’m 67!

I currently pay for Tricare and utilize my local Veterans Administration medical facilities and referrals for my healthcare. With me turning 65 and having to wait until I’m 67 for my full Social Security benefits, it just seems unfair that I’ll have to pay out-of-pocket Medicare monthly expenses for two years! Is there any way to avoid this unfair penalty? — Retired Navy Vet

DEAR RETIRED NAVY VET: First, I want to thank you for your military service to our country. Please know that here at the AMAC Foundation we care a lot about our veterans, and you may find the “For Veterans” section of our Foundation website interesting (amacfoundation.org).

Regarding your question, you should be aware that enrolling in Medicare is not mandatory, but there are consequences if you do not enroll when you become eligible (normally at age 65). For one thing, if you are a retired veteran on military TriCare, you will lose your TriCare benefits if you don’t enroll in Medicare when you are eligible (TriCare requires that you enroll in Medicare when eligible). And, since you are not yet collecting Social Security, you will be required to separately pay the Medicare Part B premium directly to Medicare (they will bill you when you enroll in Medicare).

Another potential consequence is that if you do not enroll in Medicare Part B when you are first eligible, you may incur a lifetime late enrollment penalty for enrolling in Part B later.

Something else to keep in mind is that there are two “parts” to Medicare — Part A (which is coverage for inpatient hospitalization services), and Part B, which is coverage for outpatient healthcare services (doctors, medical tests, etc.). Medicare Part A is free to you, but there is a premium for Medicare Part B ($185/month for 2025). Note that you will need to pay a Part B premium as long as you are enrolled in Medicare Part B (it doesn’t go away after you are collecting Social Security, but it is taken from your Social Security payment).

And there is no way for you to avoid the Part B premium after enrolling, and enrolling in Part B is necessary for you to continue your military TriCare-for-life benefits. Note that Medicare Part A and Part B do not include prescription drug coverage, but your TriCare coverage usually does.

It’s important to note that Medicare and Social Security are two independent senior programs with different eligibility rules. As you may know, you can collect early (reduced) Social Security at age 65 (and have your Medicare Part B premium deducted from your SS payment). But you would be collecting Social Security early and, in addition to a reduced benefit, you would also be subject to Social Security’s annual earnings test if you are still working. The SS earnings test limits how much you can earn before some of your SS benefits are taken away (if you exceed the earning limit prior to your full retirement age).

So, is it unfair that you must pay for Medicare Part B before you are collecting Social Security? Well, I think not, because the two programs are completely independent benefits (the Social Security Administration merely administers Medicare payments as a convenience). Remember, your Medicare Part A is free, but you must pay a premium for Part B, and you must take both to retain your military TriCare-for-Life benefits. You can visit this site to see how to pay your Medicare premiums until it is later deducted from your Social Security payment: www.medicare.gov/basics/costs/pay-premiums/online-bill-pay.

My Military Health allows providers and service members a flexible way to meet and securely talk about mental health care.","Good mental health is crucial for the well-being and readiness of our military force. My Military Health—the Defense Health Agency’s new care model—is changing how service members get mental health care by making the experience more convenient and user-friendly.

“My Military Health has rolled out to all Defense Health Agency military hospitals and clinics worldwide with significant potential to enhance patient convenience and expand access to care,” said Dr. Julie Freeman, DHA’s chief strategic innovation officer. “Virtual mental health care is just one of the options offered to patients.”

Studies show the great potential for virtual mental health care to improve access, reduce costs, and enhance patient engagement. Virtual mental health visits see greater adherence to follow through on care plans. Patients often feel like there is less stigma and greater confidentiality if they aren’t seen going to a mental health clinic.

Meet U.S. Air Force Maj. Betsy Trahan

Trahan, a clinical psychologist, works at the 96th Medical Group at Eglin Air Force Base, Florida. Eglin is one of five My Military Health venture sites that are testing new technologies and streamlining processes to enhance the overall patient experience. Trahan helps bring this system to life by working with experts from all military branches to make the program better.

Benefit 1: Getting Care Faster

My Military Health makes it easier for service members to get the help they need when they need it.

""We've seen big improvements in access to care at Eglin,"" Trahan said. “The program gives us more flexibility in how we deliver care and more creative ways to help patients.”

Trahan reported, “New patient appointments have increased by 61% since we started. Before, patients waited about 30 days for mental health care. Now, we can see them in just one week.”

For service members who need mental health care, this shorter wait can make a significant difference.

Benefit 2: Continuity of Care

Military life often means moving or deploying, which too often prevents patients from continuing treatment. My Military Health offers an option to keep care available no matter where service members are stationed.

“Patients can now see their provider when they want to,” said Trahan. She stressed how important it is for patients to “work with a provider who really knows them” and have “flexible options for getting care.”

This steady, consistent support from a team of available providers helps patients build trust in the system. Wherever they are, patients know they can find a provider who knows their history. This care also supports military readiness—the ability of service members to fulfill their mission anywhere in the world.

Mental health is a core component of readiness. My Military Health makes it possible for service members to stay healthy wherever they serve.

Benefit 3: Using Cutting Edge Technology to Support Patients Better

My Military Health uses digital tools like Scheduled Virtual Visits to make health care easy for patients and providers. Scheduled Virtual Visits enables providers to see their patients quickly which can help patients avoid wait times during a mental health episode.

When doctors find patients who can use digital tools for their current needs, they can act right away. As another Eglin team member put it, “If you have the patient on the phone, we can connect them right now through a virtual visit as one way to improve accessibility.”

By adding digital tools to therapy, patients get more complete care in a way that fits their individual needs and schedules.

Benefit 4: Working as a Team to Improve Patient Care

My Military Health helps different types of providers work better together, which Trahan said is a key to success.

“Working as a team has been vital to the program's success,” she explained. “We work with primary care and specialty clinics to learn from each other and coordinate each patient’s level of care. By doing so, we are improving patient care.”

Benefit 5: Improvements in Access and Satisfaction

Eglin is seeing big improvements thanks to My Military Health. Not only has it improved wait times, but patients are coming back to Eglin because they find it easier to connect with providers there.

Trahan acknowledged many other benefits coming to DHA. “Our staff and providers are more satisfied,” which helps address the burnout problem common in military health. She continued, “My Military Health helps providers feel part of positive change.”

Benefit 6: Potential to Change the Game Across the Enterprise

The success at Eglin shows how My Military Health can help DHA better support military readiness through improved mental health care. My Military Health allows providers and service members a flexible way to meet and securely talk about mental health care. It gives patients an opportunity to have conversations in real time to get support whenever and wherever they need it.

“We know mental health is a major concern, and there's limited care available on and off base,"" Trahan said. “We need smart ways to reach patients where they are.”

My Military Health offers exactly this kind of smart solution, balancing better access with provider well-being. Trahan said this as an ongoing effort, “This is a continuing project. We keep finding new ways to help our staff and patients thrive.”",https://dha.mil/-/media/Project/Images/News-Images/9068085.jpg,N,1.0,2025-05-30 15:56:21.919182

All counties are affected.

To receive an emergency refill of prescription medications, TRICARE beneficiaries should take their prescription bottle to any TRICARE retail network pharmacy. If the bottle is unavailable or the label is damaged or missing, beneficiaries should contact Express Scripts, Inc., or their retail network pharmacy for assistance.

To find a network pharmacy, beneficiaries may call Express Scripts at 1-877-363-1303, or search the network pharmacy locator.

If possible, visit the pharmacy where the prescription was filled. Prescriptions filled by a retail chain may be filled at another store in that chain. If the clinician who prescribed the medication is available, beneficiaries can ask them to call in a new prescription to any network pharmacy.

As a reminder, TRICARE beneficiaries, other than active duty service members, may receive urgent care from any TRICARE-authorized urgent care center or provider and do not need a referral. This allows beneficiaries to seek nonemergency care for illnesses or injuries if their primary care provider is unavailable because of emergencies. Any TRICARE beneficiary who reasonably believes they have an emergency should always call 911 or, go to the nearest emergency room.

Beneficiaries are advised to visit Express Scripts’ Weather Notices page for updates.

In Norway, the youngest son of Prince Haakon and Princess Mette-Marit, Sverre Magnus, has just carried out his first solo engagement with great success. This participation was not only highlighted in his country, but it also sparked interest in international media, amid a challenging time for the royal family.

A Desired and Very Well Received Debut

On May 27, Sverre Magnus welcomed Norwegian athletes and all the staff who participated in the Special Olympics World Games in Turin at an official reception. The young prince's presence was described as confident and natural. ""He was smiling and talkative, and said he was happy to be here,"" Norwegian media reported.

Caroline Vagle, a royalty expert, especially valued the way he interacted with the athletes: ""He's really good at talking with them, he asks questions, tells jokes, and creates a relaxed atmosphere. He was literally born for this."" From France, the press was impressed by his bearing and height, noting that ""he's at least two heads taller than the others.""

The Norwegian Royal Family and Their Current Challenges

While Sverre Magnus is gaining prominence, the royal family is facing delicate situations. His older sister, Ingrid Alexandra, has started her studies in social sciences with a specialization in international relations and political economy, far from home, at the University of Sydney. Another chapter of the Norwegian Royal House is the scandal involving Marius Borg Høiby, Mette-Marit's eldest son from a previous relationship.

Marius Borg was detained in August 2024 and faced serious charges that led to a week of preventive detention. The young man admitted to addiction problems and underwent treatment at a specialized clinic in London. Family members have acknowledged that they're going through a difficult time; Princess Mette-Marit herself commented that ""it's been very, very hard for us.""

Mette-Marit's Health Also Raises Concerns

In addition to the family crisis, Mette-Marit is suffering a worsening of her chronic lung disease and this problem has forced her to cancel several public appearances. In March, the palace confirmed that the princess is experiencing ""daily symptoms and ailments"" that affect her official duties. ""She needs more rest and her daily routine is changing more quickly than before,"" they noted.

But Ryder’s responsibilities stretch far beyond health care administration.
In her role as commander of Medical Readiness Command Bravo, she prepares Air Force medical teams for deployment to conflict zones around the world.
It was also at BC that Ryder met an Air Force recruiter who offered her an intensive six-month obstetrics internship as part of her enlistment.
For instance, today her charge includes providing medical care at some of the most highly classified workplaces in the country: United States Space Force installations, where military and civilian personnel monitor satellites and cybersecurity, among other duties.","On the evening of September 11, 2001, as much of the nation sat stunned and weeping before television screens, Major General Jeannine Ryder—then a young Air Force captain—received a call that would test her mettle in a time of crisis. Her commander summoned her to Dover Air Force Base, home to the US military’s largest mortuary, where she was to lead a team of medics in the duty of identifying victims of the attack on the Pentagon. With Americans still reeling from the deadliest terrorist attack on domestic soil, Ryder marshaled her team, guided them in grief through their urgent responsibility, and fulfilled the crucial mission of the moment. The weight of the experience set a course for the rest of her life. “I knew from then on,” Ryder said, “that my job was to save every casualty we could.”

It’s this combination of commitment, compassion, and resolve that has defined Ryder’s thirty-four-year military career, in which, among many other positions, she has previously served as chief nurse of the Air Force Nurse Corps. Today, Ryder occupies two of the most critical health care leadership roles in the United States military. As director of Defense Health Network Continental, she oversees a $1.1 billion budget and twenty-six military hospitals and clinics across the country that care for more than half a million patients, including active duty service members and veterans. But Ryder’s responsibilities stretch far beyond health care administration. In her role as commander of Medical Readiness Command Bravo, she prepares Air Force medical teams for deployment to conflict zones around the world. As global tensions rise and conflicts grow more complex, Ryder’s job is to ensure that military medical personnel—including doctors, medics, and lab technicians—are ready to respond however needed, whether that means performing air evacuations, responding to emergencies in flying intensive care units, or delivering lifesaving care on the ground under the most extreme conditions. “It’s about organizing, training, and equipping, to make sure that we have the right force for the next fight,” Ryder said, speaking from the Defense Health Agency headquarters just outside of Washington, DC. “When our medical personnel step off the plane, they need to be ready.”

Ryder said she was instilled with a strong sense of responsibility and caring for others while growing up in Pittsfield, Massachusetts. Her father, a high school principal, would show up early to greet teachers and students, while her grandfather, a first-generation Italian American and state legislator, cared for Ryder’s grandmother, a former nurse, after a debilitating stroke.

At Boston College, where she studied nursing, Ryder found a community that shared her values of hard work and integrity. “The instructors didn’t coddle us. We had hard clinical assignments,” she recalled of her training at local hospitals. It was also at BC that Ryder met an Air Force recruiter who offered her an intensive six-month obstetrics internship as part of her enlistment. “I wanted to gain clinical experience and grow as an independent person,” said Ryder, who took her enlistment oath in the living room of her six-person BC Mod, number 37A, on the morning of the Commencement Ball. “There was a crew of us there to support her,” recalled Patty Leyden Paul, Ryder’s then-roommate and a close friend today. Paul said Ryder, besides being a fun and supportive friend, was already showing leadership qualities. She was the one who woke up before everybody else to exercise, head to work, or study, Paul said. “There was a maturity to her. She was your wing woman.”

At the end of her Air Force internship—and after marrying her husband, Terry, with whom she now has three children—Ryder was deployed to Germany, where she quickly distinguished herself in a high-volume maternity ward. It wound up being the first stop in a long and successful career. Ryder has received two dozen assignments, including deployments to command medical operations in Southwest Asia and Afghanistan during Operation Enduring Freedom, which followed the 9/11 attacks. She was part of the first medical evacuation piloted by American-trained Afghans, and earned a Bronze Medal, awarded for achievement in combat zones.Her success was no surprise, said Lieutenant Colonel Kathy Conrad, who oversaw Ryder’s Air Force recruitment. “I knew even then—this woman was going places,” Conrad said. “She can be tough, and she’s not afraid to confront people who aren’t doing the right thing. But she’s also understanding and an excellent communicator.”

Ryder’s responsibilities have evolved along with the world and the military. For instance, today her charge includes providing medical care at some of the most highly classified workplaces in the country: United States Space Force installations, where military and civilian personnel monitor satellites and cybersecurity, among other duties. Ryder, a marathoner, said her greatest professional challenge is staying two steps ahead. What will global conflicts look like in the future, and what tools and training will medics need to respond? To prepare, she’s championing new training technologies, such as virtual reality simulations, and the development of enhanced equipment and supplies to support the agility of the Air Force’s mobile medical teams.The responsibility is great, but Ryder said it’s nothing compared with serving her country and saving the lives of those who protect it. “We have,” she said, “the best job in the world.”",http://bc.edu,N,0.0,2025-05-30 06:56:19.741999

What You Need to Know: CMS is now accepting 2025 MIPS hardship and exception applications, with expanded eligibility that allows physicians to request exemptions from the Cost performance category and administrative claims-based measures. Practices facing disruptions—such as cyberattacks or EHR issues—can apply through Dec. 31, 2025, to avoid penalties.

The Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) recently opened the 2025 Merit-based Incentive Payment System (MIPS) Extreme and Uncontrollable Circumstances (EUC) Exception and Promoting Interoperability (PI) Hardship Exception applications. Notably, CMS has expanded eligibility criteria to allow exemptions from the Cost performance category and administrative claims-based measures, providing significant relief for practices facing operational disruptions for an extended period, for example due to a cyberattack.

Individual clinicians, groups and virtual groups can submit a MIPS EUC exception application for one or more MIPS performance category (quality, cost, improvement activities, and Promoting Interoperability) due to extreme and uncontrollable circumstances for the 2025 MIPS performance period now through Dec. 31, 2025, at 8:00 p.m. Eastern time.

Alternate Payment Model (APM) entities can submit applications as well, but they must apply for all performance categories.

Key updates for 2025:

Expanded EUC exceptions: Physicians, groups and virtual groups can apply for reweighting of one or more MIPS performance categories—Quality, Cost, Improvement Activities, and Promoting Interoperability—if they experience circumstances that:

Prevent data collection necessary for MIPS reporting.

Hinder data submission for an extended period (e.g., inability to collect quality data for three months).

Disrupt normal operations, affecting performance on Cost measures and other administrative claims-based measures.

PI hardship exceptions: Eligible clinicians may request reweighting of the Promoting Interoperability category due to:

Decertified electronic health record (EHR) technology.

Insufficient internet connectivity.

Extreme and uncontrollable circumstances such as natural disasters, practice closures, severe financial distress, or vendor issues.

Lack of control over the availability of certified EHR technology.

These updates offer critical flexibility to address unforeseen challenges that may impact MIPS reporting. Practices are encouraged to assess their eligibility and submit applications as needed to avoid potential payment penalties.

If your application is approved, you will not be required to report data for the performance category or categories included in your approved application. However, please note that a qualifying data submission will override approved reweighting on a category-by-category basis. Any qualifying data you, or someone on your behalf, submits will be scored, and those performance categories will contribute to your final score.

For more information and to access the applications, visit the QPP Exception Applications page.

St. Louis-based Express Scripts is the pharmacy benefit management arm of The Cigna Group, a multinational health care and insurance company.

LITTLE ROCK, Ark. – A lawsuit was filed in Little Rock federal court on Thursday to overturn an Arkansas law preventing pharmacy benefit managers from operating pharmacies in the state.

The suit filed by the pharmacy benefit management firm Express Scripts by Evernorth claims that Act 624 of 2025 violates the Constitution and federal law. It requests that the court prevent Act 624 from going into effect.

St. Louis-based Express Scripts is the pharmacy benefit management arm of The Cigna Group, a multinational health care and insurance company. Pharmacy benefits managers act as intermediaries between pharmaceutical companies and insurance companies to set rates, including the compensation amounts paid to pharmacies.

Act 624 prohibits pharmacy benefit managers (PBMs) from owning pharmacies in Arkansas.

The lawsuit claims that Act 624 violates the Constitution’s Commerce Clause and the Privileges & Immunities Clause. It also states the law violates the Constitution’s Attainder Clause, which prevents laws from being passed that punish individuals or groups without a trial.

The lawsuit continues to claim that it interferes with federal law since the act would prevent Express Scripts from honoring its TRICARE contract with the Department of Defense. TRICARE is the health plan, including pharmacy support, for active duty National Guard, reserve, and retired military members and their families.

The suit has multiple plaintiffs under the Express Scripts umbrella and is filed against the state pharmacy board and its members.

Evernorth Health Services Vice President of Pharmacy Practice and pharmacist Susan Peppers said the suit was filed to ensure continued access to care.

“Our family of pharmacies—including Express Scripts Pharmacy, Accredo Specialty Pharmacy and Freedom Fertility Pharmacy—are proud to serve Arkansans, and this law will disrupt their access to the care we provide,” Peppers said. “If this law takes effect in January, hundreds of thousands of Arkansans will be left scrambling to navigate the forced closure of pharmacies and finding new ways to get their medicines and critical clinical support.”

Peppers continued that Evernorth was doing “everything we can” to protect Arkansas patients.

Attorney General Tim Griffin, whose office will defend against the case, stated that PBMs hinder access and quality.

“Pharmacy benefit managers wield outsized power to reap massive profits at the expense of consumers,” Griffin said. “The rise of PBMs as middlemen in the prescription drug market has resulted in patients facing fewer choices, lower quality care, and higher prices.”

Griffin added that PBMs “leverage their affiliated pharmacies to manipulate prices, corrupt the market, and destroy competition. Through Act 624, Arkansas is standing up to PBMs on behalf of consumers, and I will vigorously defend our law.”",https://www.myarklamiss.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/15/2025/05/pharmacy.jpg?w=1280,N,0.0,2025-05-29 21:56:29.622210

Mental health is a vital part of your overall well-being. Whether you’re having difficulty managing day-to-day stress or navigating more complex challenges, TRICARE offers mental health support when—and where—you need it.

“Getting care early is just like preventive medicine, such as labs or regular checkups,” said Jeannine Pickrell, director for Population Health and Disease Management, TRICARE Health Plan, at the Defense Health Agency. “You can prevent smaller issues from becoming big ones by checking in with yourself through a TRICARE mental health provider. TRICARE offers a variety of ways to find and get the care you need.”

More than ever, people recognize the importance of mental well-being. Unlock your health by understanding how to access care based on your TRICARE plan.

Ways to access care

TRICARE has options for different mental health needs. Services are available whether you’re seeking support for the short or long term. Depending on your health plan, you may need a referral or pre-authorization.

You can start by:

• Talking to your primary care manager

• Reaching out directly to a TRICARE-authorized provider

• Exploring virtual health options to speak with a provider from home

Not sure what applies to you? Check with your TRICARE contractor.

Covered mental health services

As described in the Mental Health and Substance Use Disorder Services Fact Sheet, TRICARE covers services can include:

• Outpatient counseling like individual, group, or family therapy

• Intensive outpatient programs that meet throughout the week

• Partial hospitalization programs that meet throughout the week

• Inpatient care at a hospital or other facility

Are virtual health services a better fit for you? TRICARE covers many virtual options for getting mental health care from your own home. Options include telemental health services through virtual-only providers, as well as local providers who may offer a combination of in-person and virtual health services.

How you access them is specific to your region:

• East Region: The East Region contractor, Humana Military, offers services through Doctor on Demand, Teladoc, Telamynd, and Talkspace, as well as other smaller provider groups.

• West Region: The West Region contractor, TriWest Healthcare Alliance, offers services through Doctor on Demand, Teladoc, Telemynd, Skytherapist, Fusion Care Group, NVelUp, Open Mind Health, Talkspace, and Veterans Room, as well as other smaller provider groups.

• Overseas: If you’re overseas, the country where you live must allow virtual health services. Your provider must be licensed to practice where you live. Contact your TRICARE Overseas Regional Call Center for more information, including eligibility of providers. Visit the Overseas virtual health page to learn more about the overseas requirements.

However, there may be limitations on these services in certain areas to include Medication-assisted treatment, substance use disorder, and applied behavior analysis services may not be included.

To request telemental health services:

• Use the Find a Doctor tool to search your regional contractor’s network provider directory.

• Contact your regional contractor. You can learn more about the options available to you based on who you are and where you live.

Types of mental health care

TRICARE provides mental health coverage for all eligible beneficiaries. How you access them depends on your health plan, category, and whether care is immediate or ongoing.

Emergency mental health care

If you or someone you know is at immediate risk of self-harm, or harm to others, this is a medical emergency. Emergency mental health care doesn’t require a referral. You should:

• Call 911 or go to the nearest emergency room.

• Your TRICARE regional contractor should be contacted within 24 hours or next day, if admitted.

You can also call the Veterans Crisis Line:

• Call 988, option 1.

•Text 838255.

• Chat online.

Again, if you or a loved one is in danger or needs urgent support, go to the nearest emergency room or call 911.

Nonemergency mental health care

You don’t need to be in crisis to seek help. TRICARE covers a range of mental health services. How you access them depends on your beneficiary group.

Here’s how it works:

Active duty service members

• Care must begin at a military hospital or clinic, or a TRICARE-authorized provider for those enrolled in TRICARE Prime Remote.

• ADSMs may also request an evaluation from their supervisor without providing a reason. These are confidential and protected. This is part of the Brandon Act implementation, which aims to reduce the stigma of seeking mental health care.

• Referrals and pre-authorizations are required outside military hospitals or clinics.

All other TRICARE beneficiaries

Do you have TRICARE Prime?

• You don’t need a referral if you see a TRICARE network provider.

• Beyond basic outpatient care, a referral may be required.

• Start with your PCM if you’re unsure what you need.

Do you have TRICARE Select?

• You can visit any TRICARE-authorized provider for mental health services.

• Referrals aren’t required, but you’ll pay lower out-of-pocket costs by choosing a network provider.

• You don’t need a pre-authorization for routine care, but some specialty services may require one.

Do you have TRICARE For Life?

• You should see a Medicare provider. Follow Medicare's rules for mental health care until those benefits are exhausted.

• Medicare is your primary payer. TRICARE is secondary.

• If Medicare benefits are exhausted, you’ll need a referral and pre-authorization from TRICARE before you get care.

Are you a National Guard and Reserve member or family member?

• Your eligibility and TRICARE coverage depend on the National Guard or Reserve member’s duty status. You should contact your unit’s personnel office with eligibility questions. You can review your eligibility in milConnect. When getting care, seeing a TRICARE network provider can reduce your costs. If you’re on active duty orders for:

• More than 30 days: You’re eligible. You receive the same benefits as ADSMs.

• 30 days or less: You may be eligible to enroll in TRICARE Reserve Select.

Do you have a TRICARE health plan overseas?

• Availability varies by location and some services may be limited. Contact the TRICARE Overseas contractor for help finding what is right for you.

Other resources include:

• The Psychological Health Resource Center (866-966-1020) for community resources

• The Military Health System Nurse Advice Line (800-874-2273, option 1) for mental health questions

• Military OneSource (800-342-9647) for non-medical counseling services

• Unit or military chaplains for non-medical support

• U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs or VetCenter for eligible veterans

Taking the first step

When it comes to mental health challenges—or maintaining good mental health—you’re not alone. It’s okay to reach out to find the services right for you, and TRICARE has your back every step of the way.

My Military Health—the Defense Health Agency’s new care model—is changing how service members get mental health care by making the experience more convenient and user-friendly.

“My Military Health has rolled out to all Defense Health Agency military hospitals and clinics worldwide with significant potential to enhance patient convenience and expand access to care,” said Dr. Julie Freeman, DHA’s chief strategic innovation officer. “Virtual mental health care is just one of the options offered to patients.”

Studies show the great potential for virtual mental health care to improve access, reduce costs, and enhance patient engagement. Virtual mental health visits see greater adherence to follow through on care plans. Patients often feel like there is less stigma and greater confidentiality if they aren’t seen going to a mental health clinic.

Meet U.S. Air Force Maj. Betsy Trahan

Trahan, a clinical psychologist, works at the 96th Medical Group at Eglin Air Force Base, Florida. Eglin is one of five My Military Health venture sites that are testing new technologies and streamlining processes to enhance the overall patient experience. Trahan helps bring this system to life by working with experts from all military branches to make the program better.

Benefit 1: Getting Care Faster

My Military Health makes it easier for service members to get the help they need when they need it.

""We've seen big improvements in access to care at Eglin,"" Trahan said. “The program gives us more flexibility in how we deliver care and more creative ways to help patients.”

Trahan reported, “New patient appointments have increased by 61% since we started. Before, patients waited about 30 days for mental health care. Now, we can see them in just one week.”

For service members who need mental health care, this shorter wait can make a significant difference.

Benefit 2: Continuity of Care

Military life often means moving or deploying, which too often prevents patients from continuing treatment. My Military Health offers an option to keep care available no matter where service members are stationed.

“Patients can now see their provider when they want to,” said Trahan. She stressed how important it is for patients to “work with a provider who really knows them” and have “flexible options for getting care.”

This steady, consistent support from a team of available providers helps patients build trust in the system. Wherever they are, patients know they can find a provider who knows their history. This care also supports military readiness—the ability of service members to fulfill their mission anywhere in the world.

Mental health is a core component of readiness. My Military Health makes it possible for service members to stay healthy wherever they serve.

Benefit 3: Using Cutting Edge Technology to Support Patients Better

My Military Health uses digital tools like Scheduled Virtual Visits to make health care easy for patients and providers. Scheduled Virtual Visits enables providers to see their patients quickly which can help patients avoid wait times during a mental health episode.

When doctors find patients who can use digital tools for their current needs, they can act right away. As another Eglin team member put it, “If you have the patient on the phone, we can connect them right now through a virtual visit as one way to improve accessibility.”

By adding digital tools to therapy, patients get more complete care in a way that fits their individual needs and schedules.

Benefit 4: Working as a Team to Improve Patient Care

My Military Health helps different types of providers work better together, which Trahan said is a key to success.

“Working as a team has been vital to the program's success,” she explained. “We work with primary care and specialty clinics to learn from each other and coordinate each patient’s level of care. By doing so, we are improving patient care.”

Benefit 5: Improvements in Access and Satisfaction

Eglin is seeing big improvements thanks to My Military Health. Not only has it improved wait times, but patients are coming back to Eglin because they find it easier to connect with providers there.

Trahan acknowledged many other benefits coming to DHA. “Our staff and providers are more satisfied,” which helps address the burnout problem common in military health. She continued, “My Military Health helps providers feel part of positive change.”

Benefit 6: Potential to Change the Game Across the Enterprise

The success at Eglin shows how My Military Health can help DHA better support military readiness through improved mental health care. My Military Health allows providers and service members a flexible way to meet and securely talk about mental health care. It gives patients an opportunity to have conversations in real time to get support whenever and wherever they need it.

“We know mental health is a major concern, and there's limited care available on and off base,"" Trahan said. “We need smart ways to reach patients where they are.”

My Military Health offers exactly this kind of smart solution, balancing better access with provider well-being. Trahan said this as an ongoing effort, “This is a continuing project. We keep finding new ways to help our staff and patients thrive.”",https://d1ldvf68ux039x.cloudfront.net/thumbs/photos/2505/9068085/1000w_q95.jpg,N,1.0,2025-05-29 15:56:30.055217

Related: A Decade After Scandal, VA Health Care May Be at Another Crossroads Story Continues","The Department of Veterans Affairs and Pentagon will work more closely to ensure that veterans have an easier time accessing health care and benefits as they leave the U.S. military, the departments' secretaries announced Wednesday.

VA Secretary Doug Collins and Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth signed a memorandum last week pledging that their departments will collaborate on care for veterans and enroll troops in VA care before they leave the service. They also plan to improve support for service members diagnosed with mental health conditions as they transition to civilian life.

The two men released a video Wednesday saying the cooperation is a priority to ensure that service members and veterans get the benefits they have earned.

""We believe that Americans who raise their right hand and serve deserve a Department of Defense and VA that work in tandem looking out for their best needs,"" Collins said.

""It's a shame that for far too many years that pipeline, there's been a disconnect,"" Hegseth said.

Roughly 200,000 service members leave the armed forces each year. And while they are required to take transition assistance classes beginning at least a year before they plan to leave the military, many don't, receiving waivers from their commanding officers, according to the Government Accountability Office.

The two-day programs provide information on career development, VA benefits, education and other support services. But veterans advocates say that allowing service members to opt out of the courses or rush through the curriculum is a disservice to veterans.

During a hearing in March, veterans service organizations said that, without attending the Transition Assistance Program in a timely manner, veterans may not apply for benefits or prepare adequately for their transition.

""Systemic delays must be remedied to ensure service members thrive rather than struggle in life post military service. Veterans who experience a turbulent transition will surely influence how friends, family and siblings view service in the military,"" Andrew Petrie, senior policy associate at the American Legion, said in a statement to the House Veterans Affairs subcommittee on economic opportunity.

The departments have increased transition support in the past several years, creating a transition program for service members with mental health issues to provide referrals and coaching, and making phone calls to new veterans.

But those programs required active participation by the service members -- enrolling in VA health services or requesting assistance from providers with knowledge of the programs.

In their memo signed May 23, Hegseth and Collins pledged that the two departments would ""optimize shared use of health care resources, facilities and workforce.""

The departments already operate a joint medical facility, the James Lovell Federal Health Care Center in North Chicago Illinois, and have agreements at roughly a dozen Defense Department clinics to allow VA medical professionals to see veterans in those facilities. But the new memo pledges to increase joint planning and shared expertise and infrastructure even more, although it does not include specific steps the departments plan to take.

According to the agreement, the VA and DoD also are working on a plan that would allow service members to enroll in VA health care before their end of service date.

And they pledged to improve continuity of care for service members with mental health conditions -- for example, communication between providers and pre-scheduled appointments.

""Providing continuity of care is more than just policy; it will help save lives,"" they wrote.

""This is only the beginning. From the unified electronic health record and a Joint Separation Health Assessment to strengthen suicide prevention initiatives, our departments will continue breaking down barriers to better serve those who serve,"" they wrote.

They include Express Scripts and CVS Caremark, which is owned by the same parent company that runs CVS retail pharmacies around the country.
Independent pharmacies have lobbied the Arkansas Legislature for years for protections against what they say are uncompetitive practices by PBMs.
Now Express Scripts, which does a robust mail-order pharmacy business in Arkansas, is leading the legal charge against what is now Act 624.
Express Scripts is owned by The Cigna Group, a Connecticut-based insurance and health care company ranked 15 on the Fortune 500 list.","One of the largest health care companies in the country announced Thursday it’s suing Arkansas over a new law, signed by Gov. Sarah Sanders in April, that would bar it from operating pharmacies in the state.

The plaintiff, Express Scripts, is a pharmacy benefit manager, or PBM, a corporate middleman that handles prescription drug claims and negotiates prices on behalf of insurers. PBMs help determine how much pharmacies get paid for filling prescriptions — but the nation’s three biggest PBMs are owned by health care conglomerates that also run their own in-house pharmacies. They include Express Scripts and CVS Caremark, which is owned by the same parent company that runs CVS retail pharmacies around the country.

Independent pharmacies have lobbied the Arkansas Legislature for years for protections against what they say are uncompetitive practices by PBMs. This spring, lawmakers passed a bill that prohibits a company that operates a PBM from also holding a pharmacy license in the state. The ban, which takes effect in January, includes online pharmacies that handle mail-order prescriptions.

CVS fought hard against the bill, mounting an aggressive PR campaign and saying the company’s 23 retail locations in Arkansas could be forced to close if it were signed into law. (CVS has said more recently it’s searching for a way to keep those stores open but warned they’re still at risk of closure.)

Now Express Scripts, which does a robust mail-order pharmacy business in Arkansas, is leading the legal charge against what is now Act 624.

In a complaint filed in federal court in Little Rock on Thursday, Express Scripts argues the new state law “imperils the health” of more than 50,000 Arkansans who depend on various pharmacies operated by the company. Among them are members of the military and their families who are covered by TRICARE, which provides health insurance for servicemembers.

Express Scripts “has served for more than 20 years as the principal mail-order pharmacy provider for the U.S. Department of Defense’s TRICARE program, which provides healthcare services to military members, retirees, and families,” the complaint says. “Last year, Express Scripts Pharmacy dispensed more than 386,000 prescriptions to over 20,000 TRICARE beneficiaries in Arkansas.”

Express Scripts also operates a separate mail-order pharmacy, Accredo Health Group, that it says provides specialty medications to over 5,700 patients in Arkansas with complex and chronic medical conditions “including cancer, bleeding disorders, multiple sclerosis, and numerous rare diseases.” Many of those prescriptions have gone to TRICARE beneficiaries, the complaint says.

A third pharmacy group affiliated with the company, Freedom Fertility Pharmacy, is “the nation’s leading fertility pharmacy” and serves hundreds of Arkansans trying to “grow their families,” the complaint says.

Express Scripts says the new Arkansas law is “unconstitutional several times over.” It violates the U.S. Constitution’s commerce clause and prohibitions on states unfairly “burdening out-of-state citizens” and punishing “specifically designated persons or groups,” the company argues. And it impermissibly attempts to preempt federal statutes and regulations governing TRICARE, the complaint says.

Arkansas Attorney General Tim Griffin said the state was “standing up to PBMs on behalf of consumers” in passing Act 624 and vowed to defend the law in court.

“Pharmacy benefit managers wield outsized power to reap massive profits at the expense of consumers,” he said in an emailed statement. “The rise of PBMs as middlemen in the prescription drug market has resulted in patients facing fewer choices, lower quality care, and higher prices. PBMs leverage their affiliated pharmacies to manipulate prices, corrupt the market, and destroy competition.”

All of the “big three” PBMs are affiliated with corporations that dominate the U.S. health insurance landscape. Express Scripts is owned by The Cigna Group, a Connecticut-based insurance and health care company ranked 15 on the Fortune 500 list. CVS Caremark is owned by CVS Health, which also owns insurer Aetna along with some 9,000 retail pharmacy locations nationwide; it’s the sixth-largest company in the country.

The third big PBM, Optum Rx, is owned by UnitedHealth Group, the fourth-largest company in the U.S., behind only Walmart, Amazon and Apple.

The complaint says the law — and comments made by state legislators who argued for the bill this spring — make it “abundantly clear that the statute’s purpose and effect is to protect local pharmacies domiciled in Arkansas from out-of-state competition, and to do so by punishing specific out-of-state competitors.”

If the Legislature can ban large out-of-state companies to protect local independent pharmacies, the plaintiffs argue, it could do so in other sectors as well.

“Imagine, for example, a bill that bans out-of-state movie streaming services such as Netflix from serving customers in Arkansas because movie streaming services compete with local, independent movie theaters,” the complaint says. “Myriad examples of similar protectionist legislation involving a range of businesses, from grocery and hardware stores to gas stations, are easy to envision.”

""Importantly, this progress sets us on an efficient and expeditious path to potentially deliver TSHA-102 to patients and families suffering from this devastating disease with high unmet need.""

The FDA advised Taysha to submit the pivotal part B trial protocol and associated statistical analysis plan as an amendment to its investigational new drug (IND) application, which would eliminate the need for a formal end-of-phase meeting, Taysha said. The company expects to submit this amendment this quarter and initiate the pivotal trial in the third quarter of 2025.

Taysha developed the pivotal trial design after analyzing natural history data from a longitudinal study from the International Rett Syndrome Foundation, in which investigators found patients at least 6 years of age tended to reach a developmental plateau with a low likelihood of gaining new or regaining developmental milestones.

In part A of the REVEAL trials, 10 patients with Rett syndrome between 6 years and 21 years of age have received TSHA-102, which is designed to deliver a truncated version of the gene that's abnormal in Rett syndrome patients, MECP2. The transgene, which the company refers to as miniMECP2, functions like the full-length MECP2 gene, according to Taysha.

All patients gained at least one developmental milestone related to fine motor, gross motor, or communication skills after receiving the gene therapy, with patients who received a higher dose responding 25 percent faster than those who received a low dose. Investigators did not observe serious adverse events or dose-limiting toxicities related to TSHA-102, and treatment-emergent adverse events were mild to moderate in severity.

Separately on Wednesday, Taysha announced the pricing of an underwritten public offering from which it expects to earn gross proceeds of approximately $200 million. The public offering, which is expected to close on or about Friday, covers 46,868,687 shares of Taysha's common stock at a price to the public of $2.75 per share and, for certain investors, pre-funded warrants to purchase 25,858,586 shares at an offering price of $2.749 per pre-funded warrant. Taysha also granted underwriters a 30-day option to purchase up to an additional 10,909,090 shares at the public offering price.",https://crain-platform-precisiononcologynews-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/app-icons/favicon.ico,N,0.0,2025-05-29 13:56:21.854969

One of the best-known is Medicare, a health care program primarily aimed at people over 65 years old.
Social Security clarifies TRICARE is a health care program managed by the Defense Health Agency (DHA).

One of the best-known is Medicare, a health care program primarily aimed at people over 65 years old. However, there is another less well-known but equally important program: TRICARE.

What is TRICARE and who can benefit? Social Security clarifies

TRICARE is a health care program managed by the Defense Health Agency (DHA). It is designed to provide medical coverage to active and retired members of the U.S. armed forces, as well as their families. This includes members of the National Guard and Reservists.

TRICARE beneficiaries have access to a wide range of medical services, including hospital care, medical consultations, dental and vision services, and prescription medications. In addition, for those who are also eligible for Medicare Part A and B, TRICARE acts as a supplement, covering deductibles and copayments that Medicare doesn't cover.

How to access easily? You must meet this in the U.S.

Eligibility for TRICARE depends on the sponsor's military status. Active duty service members and their families are automatically enrolled. Retirees and their dependents must make sure to keep their information updated in the Defense Enrollment Eligibility Reporting System (DEERS) to continue receiving benefits.

TRICARE offers numerous advantages. Among them, comprehensive coverage of medical services, low out-of-pocket costs, and access to a wide network of health care providers stand out. In addition, for beneficiaries who are also enrolled in Medicare, TRICARE provides additional coverage that helps reduce total medical expenses.

SSA's commitment to beneficiaries and recent changes in the law

The Social Security Administration (SSA) has shown its commitment to beneficiaries through the implementation of the Social Security Fairness Act. This law eliminates provisions that reduced benefits for certain workers, such as teachers and firefighters, who also received pensions not covered by Social Security.

As a result, more than 3M people have seen increases in their monthly benefits, some exceeding $1,000. Recently, changes have been implemented in identity verification to access SSA services.

All with the goal of improving security and efficiency in the administration of benefits. These changes reflect SSA's ongoing commitment to adapt to beneficiaries' needs and ensure the integrity of their programs.",https://elcierredigital.com/filesedc/uploads/image/post/montaje-donald-trump-seguridad-social-y-dolares_1200_800.webp,N,0.0,2025-05-29 13:56:26.028215

I know claims are being denied across the board for a lot of people, but is anyone else experiencing randomized claims being denied?

I have 19 claims throughout the year that are denied and yet some to the same exact provider were paid. They are billing the same way because I called them and asked. Tricare keeps saying that I'm out of their system for those bills. I have done a three-way call with DEERS and Tricare to ensure that I am in fact in their systems under the same numbers that both of them have.

At this point I have over $30,000 in bills from 7 different billing agencies and of course no one bills in proper time so early ones from the year are past a 90-day claim appeal. I have no clue what to do anymore. I've already been escalated to level three claims with Tricare and they are obviously not doing anything despite a case being opened for me. They don't know why I keep being randomly denied except to say that I wasn't in their system at the time. The providers have resubmitted the bills and they are still not being paid despite Tricare agreeing I should have been in the system. Bonus: I'm Triwest region so I have to wait for them to open before being transferred to Eastern time for claims.

Serious question: Am I allowed to sue Tricare at this point? $30,000 is more than my entire savings and even if I could get a loan to pay it all and avoid going to collections, I'd have less than zero left.
