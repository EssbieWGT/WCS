Navy tests new digital health system to modernize at-sea care Mass Communication Specialist 2nd Class Sasha Ambrose

MAYPORT, Fla. – Navy Medicine conducted its first pilot test of the Operational Medicine Care Delivery Platform (OpMed CDP) aboard the Arleigh Burke-class destroyer USS Carney (DDG 64) to bring modern, seamless patient care to service members aboard ships, Dec. 1-12.

The Joint Operational Medicine Information System (JOMIS), under the Program Executive Office for Defense Healthcare Management Systems, developed OpMed CDP as part of modernized health IT software suite. This pilot program was established through a partnership with the U.S. Navy Bureau of Medicine and Surgery (BUMED), U.S. Fleet Forces Command (USFFC), Commander, Naval Surface Force Atlantic (CNSL), Commander, Naval Medical Forces Atlantic (NMFL), and JOMIS to gain fleet approval of the software’s functionality.

“The JOMIS ecosystem will transform the way our clinicians, physicians, and corpsmen provide care to warfighters in operational settings to maintain patient data flow through the continuum of care,” stated Lt. Cmdr. Erik Lawrence, U.S. Navy chief nursing informatics officer for JOMIS assigned to BUMED.

During the 12-day test, the ship’s crew received comprehensive, user-centered training on the system. The goal was to make documenting and accessing a patient’s electronic health record simple and accurate – from pharmacy and lab work to general check-ups – and to ensure connectivity with the Military Health System’s MHS GENESIS platform.

“We’re still learning how it [OpMed CDP] works, but the team has been really helpful with answering questions and listening to feedback, so I’m really excited to keep moving,” described Hospital Corpsman 3rd Class Johnny Percadoni, assigned to Carney, during a hands-on, scenario-based session. “It’s a different day and a new system, but I think it’s going to become a lot more prevalent and useful for us.”

This phased, structured training install approach – also called fielding – is critical to implementing OpMed CDP across the Navy. The JOMIS Fielding Plan is designed to ensure a disciplined rollout that allows for agile development, continuous user feedback, and alignment with operational readiness cycles.

“We’ve been developing this agile software for the past three and a half years to provide better decision support at the point of care for medical providers,” explained Cmdr. John de Geus, the U.S. Navy’s chief health informatics officer. “But also to provide data to operational commanders in dynamic, real-time environments.”

Based on the initial trial, CNSL has decided to move into the next phase: an extended pilot to ensure that the final product will be resilient, effective, and ready for the demands of the fleet.

""A successful fielding isn't just about delivering software; it's about delivering the right capability,” concluded de Geus. “The initial pilot provided crucial insights, which is why we are moving to an extended pilot. This decision reinforces our commitment to a truly feedback-driven process, prioritizing the needs of our Sailors above all else.”

Once all phases are complete, Carney will be the first ship to use OpMed CDP for daily medical operations. This will modernize Navy Medicine’s readiness and ensure seamless data sharing, ultimately help to prepare warfighters for their missions at sea.

For 250 years, Navy Medicine – represented by more than 44,000 highly-trained military and civilian healthcare professionals – has delivered quality healthcare and enduring expeditionary medical support to the warfighter on, below, and above the sea, and ashore.",,N,0.0,2025-12-29 21:56:20.082007

MAXWELL AIR FORCE BASE, Ala. – The Maxwell Medical Group's Dental Flight is taking a significant step to boost Airman readiness by restoring advanced in-house oral surgery capabilities and integrating digital dentistry to provide faster, more comprehensive care to the installation's active-duty population.

To better support this readiness posture, the clinic is now equipped to handle complex procedures that were previously outsourced.

“They've been referring out a lot of procedures: root canals, implants, wisdom teeth,” said U.S. Air Force Capt. Thomas Hardison, Maxwell Medical Group comprehensive dentist. “And so being here and having the training to do those procedures brought a lot of care back in-house.”

The dental flight’s role is critical in clearing Airmen for deployment, often requiring the team to react with urgency to meet short-notice mission requirements.

“When patients are deploying, we ensure that they are ready to go. If they do have things that are limiting them from going, we will stop what we're doing to get them out the door,” said U.S. Air Force Tech. Sgt. Ernessie Ladouceur, Maxwell Medical Group dental flight chief.

While bringing back sedation capabilities has been the most recent focus at the clinic, there are several types of procedures the flight also aims to bring back.

“We'll do implants, sinus lifts, ridge augmentation, and other periodontal surgeries,” said Hardison.

Modernization has been a key component of the clinic's enhanced capabilities, with a renewed focus on digital dentistry. This shift reduces chair time for patients and improves the precision of care through advanced technology.

“We have two 3D printers up and running now,” said Hardison. “We do most everything digitally now. So, we scan everything, 3D print models, and mill restorations.”

Keeping these advanced procedures within the military health system provides a direct benefit to the patient by ensuring all their medical information is centralized and accessible.

“I think the impact is the continuity of care. More patients are being able to have their care here with us and not seeing a provider off base,” said Ladouceur. “It’s one less thing they have to worry about.”

The flight’s core function is ensuring every Airman is medically prepared for global operations.

“The unit's overall mission is to make sure that our active-duty members are able to be fit and ready,” said Ladouceur. “So that way when they're out there, they're not having to worry about something like a toothache.”",,N,1.0,2025-12-29 21:56:30.235908

Take steps to safeguard your growing family Marriage is a major life milestone — and it’s also a TRICARE Qualifying Life Event.","Getting married is an exciting milestone in your life! It’s also a time when many changes come along, including changes to your health coverage. Whether you’re a service member, a retiree, or marrying someone who is, it’s important to understand how marriage can affect your TRICARE eligibility and coverage.

“There is sometimes a misconception that TRICARE benefits will update automatically after you get married, but that’s not the case,” said Shane Pham, an analyst with TRICARE Policy and Programs at the Defense Health Agency. “If you don’t add your spouse to the Defense Enrollment Eligibility Reporting System, they won’t be able to use TRICARE. A small step makes a big difference.”

Marriage is a TRICARE Qualifying Life Event, meaning that you have 90 days from the date of marriage to make any changes to your TRICARE health plan. Spouses of service members are eligible for coverage, including active duty spouses, retiree spouses, and National Guard and Reserve spouses.

Stepchildren are also eligible for TRICARE if the parent of the child and the sponsor are married. The sponsor doesn’t need to adopt the stepchildren. But if the sponsor does adopt stepchildren, they may be eligible to keep their TRICARE coverage even if their parent divorces the sponsor.

Update DEERS

After getting married, one of the most important steps is to update your information in DEERS in person. DEERS is a database that TRICARE uses to determine eligibility. You must update DEERS within 90 days of your marriage to make changes to your TRICARE plan.

Although there are many changes you can make online in DEERS, you must add your spouse in person. You can visit any Uniformed Services ID card office to add your spouse and any stepchildren to DEERS. Make sure that you bring your:

Marriage certificate

Spouse's birth certificate

Spouse's Social Security card

Spouse's photo ID

Choosing the right health plan for your family

Once you’ve added your spouse and any stepchildren to DEERS, you can enroll them in a TRICARE plan. The options available depend on your status and where you live. Options include:

TRICARE Prime

TRICARE Select

US Family Health Plan

TRICARE Prime Demo (available only in Atlanta, Georgia and Tampa, Florida areas)

TRICARE Select Overseas

TRICARE For Life (Note: Enrollment isn’t required for TFL. Your coverage is automatic if you have Medicare Part A and Part B and you’re eligible for TRICARE.)

For active duty families, other options may include:

TRICARE Prime Remote

TRICARE Prime Overseas

TRICARE Prime Remote Overseas

If you and your spouse are both active duty service members, you’ll each have your own DEERS profile. If you and your partner have children, you’ll need to choose one parent to be their sponsor in DEERS.

Dental coverage

Your spouse is also eligible for dental coverage. This isn’t automatically covered in TRICARE medical plans. As described in the TRICARE Dental Program Brochure, the TRICARE Dental Program is available for family members of ADSMs and National Guard and Reserve members. In some cases, retirees and their family members may be eligible for dental insurance through the Federal Employees Dental and Vision Insurance Program.

Vision options

Eligible beneficiaries who are enrolled in a TRICARE health plan can also enroll in a vision plan through FEDVIP. Eligible beneficiaries include:

Active duty family members

National Guard and Reserve members and their family members

Retirees and their family members

When marriage may mean loss of coverage

In some cases, getting married may actually mean that you’ll lose TRICARE eligibility. In the following situations, getting married causes your eligibility to end:

A surviving (widowed) spouse remarries

A former spouse remarries

An adult child using TRICARE Young Adult gets married (unless they marry a service member)

If any of these applies to you or a family member, it’s important to plan ahead. Losing TRICARE eligibility means you’ll need to explore other health coverage options to avoid a gap in care.

Take steps to safeguard your growing family

Over a 15-month period, the medical center performed 78 robotic navigational bronchoscopy procedures, achieving a diagnostic accuracy rate of 91 percent. This performance places Madigan among the top facilities nationwide using similar technology and exceeds the averages reported in recent studies.

A majority of the positive diagnoses made at Madigan during this period were cases of lung cancer. In total, 56 cancer cases were identified, along with several cases involving infection, inflammation, or other non-cancerous conditions. The program’s findings also helped guide decisions about surgical treatment. More than 50 patients were referred for surgery based on the results of their robotic bronchoscopy, and in 44 of those cases, the cancer diagnosis was confirmed after the tissue was removed. This high confirmation rate reflects the accuracy of the robotic system in identifying malignant nodules and ensuring patients receive the right care at the right time.

Several features contribute to the program’s outcomes. The Ion system’s shape-sensing technology enables physicians to precisely navigate to the target area, while rapid on-site evaluation allows pathologists to examine biopsy samples immediately during the procedure. Together, these capabilities help clinicians quickly determine whether enough tissue has been collected, reducing the need for repeat procedures.

With its strong performance, low complication rate, and ability to diagnose and guide treatment in a single visit, Madigan’s Ion program represents a major step forward in lung cancer care within the Military Health System. The early results show that robotic-assisted bronchoscopy can improve the accuracy of lung cancer detection while easing the overall process for patients, offering a promising model for future expansion across military and civilian hospitals alike.

“It’s all about providing the right care at the right time.” The Primary Care department, which includes pediatrics, adolescent and young adult medicine (AYA), and internal medicine, now offers expanded hours.

Through Walter’s Way, a new “one-call solution” initiative, patients can reach their care team directly, get advice from a nurse, schedule appointments, and even request prescription renewals, all in one call.

“The idea behind Walter’s Way is putting our patients and their needs first with a one-call solution to take care of their needs,” said U.S. Army Lt. Col. Elizabeth Simmons, Deputy Director for the Department of Medicine and Primary Care lead for Walter’s Way. “Whether it’s nursing advice, same-day appointments, or medication renewals, we want to go above and beyond for our Walter Reed family.”

Callers reach a staffed line that pairs nurses and medical support assistants (MSAs). The team can schedule well visits, same-day or next-day acute care, check referral status, and begin prescription-renewal processes. Walter’s Way also now includes nurse triage on the initial call, so patients receive clinical guidance immediately.

“Our triage nurses can help determine if any issue can be managed at home, needs medical advice, or requires an in-person or virtual visit,” said Simmons. “It’s all about providing the right care at the right time.”

The Primary Care department, which includes pediatrics, adolescent and young adult medicine (AYA), and internal medicine, now offers expanded hours. Early morning, evenings and Saturday clinics will help patients fit their care into busy schedules. Internal medicine provides virtual Saturday appointments and pediatrics offer early appointments for school-day families and full Saturday clinics.

“We’ve designed our schedule to meet patients where they are. That flexibility is a big part of Walter’s Way,” said Simmons.

The initiative also helps strengthen continuity of care by connecting patients to their primary care team more consistently. The program standardizes triage protocols and ensures that patients are scheduled appropriately for in-person or virtual visits, improving both access and clinical outcomes.

Patients have already noticed the difference. One family praised a Walter’s Way nurse who “went above and beyond to help us get my son scheduled for an appointment.”

The phrase National Guard Substance Abuse Program is often used as a catch-all for the prevention, education, screening, referral, and treatment pathways available to National Guard members who are dealing with alcohol or drug-related concerns.

In real life, it is not always one single, uniform program that looks the same in every unit and every state. It commonly reflects how Guard resources, duty status rules, and clinical care options work together for a particular member at a particular time.

If you are searching for a substance abuse program for National Guard members, the practical answer is that support is usually available. However, the “right” pathway depends on who you are (service member or family), your duty status, and what level of care you need.

Our latest resource from TriCareRehabs.com is here to help you fully understand the landscape involved in what is covered for both National Guard members and their families when it comes to addiction and mental health treatment.

What is the National Guard Substance Abuse Program?

At its core, the National Guard Substance Abuse Program is a structured approach to reduce risk, identify concerns early, and connect active duty service members to appropriate support.

For some people, that support starts with education, drug abuse prevention, suicide prevention, or a brief intervention. For others, it includes clinical evaluation and engagement in national guard substance abuse treatment that matches the severity of the issue and the realities of military life.

An important detail for many Guardsmen is that treatment may occur in civilian settings. National Guard members live and work in their communities, so care is often delivered by licensed civilian providers even when the Guard is involved in referral, coordination, or readiness considerations.

Who Is Eligible for National Guard Substance Abuse Program Support?

Eligibility is often broad, but the route into services can vary based on the service component and individual circumstances. In general, any National Guard member who has concerns about alcohol or drug use, impairment, or related consequences may be able to access screening, referral guidance, or treatment coordination through Guard channels.

Eligibility and Duty Status: Title 10, Title 32, and Drilling Status

Duty status matters because it can determine which policies apply and which systems you are operating within. This is one reason online answers can sound inconsistent.

Two people can ask the same question and get two different correct answers if their duty statuses are different.

Family Members and Dependents

Families often want to know whether they can access help through the same “program.” Guard-facing programs tend to focus on the service member, but family members may have access to separate support resources.

In some situations, family involvement may also be clinically appropriate within the service member’s treatment plan.

Confidentiality and Command Involvement

Many Guardsmen hesitate because they worry that asking for help automatically becomes a disciplinary matter. How confidentiality works depends on the type of service being used (non-medical counseling versus medical treatment), safety requirements, and the policies that apply in your current context.

A useful way to think about it is that different doors have different rules, and part of getting oriented is knowing which door you are walking through.

Are National Guardsmen Covered By ASAP?

The question: Are Guardsmen Covered By ASAP? Comes up frequently because ASAP is a well-known Army framework. The evergreen answer is: it depends on status and context.

Some Guard members may fall under ASAP rules in certain circumstances, while others will follow Guard-specific pathways, state-directed procedures, or civilian clinical systems.

When ASAP May Be the Right Framework

ASAP may be relevant when a Guardsman is operating in an Army active-duty environment or when Army policy is the controlling structure for prevention, drug testing, referral, or rehabilitation processes.

When Guard-Specific Pathways Are More Common

For many drilling members, the pathway may look more like Guard coordination plus civilian clinical care. TriCareRehabs typically frames this point neutrally: the name of the program matters less than identifying which pathway applies to your duty status and location, because that determines what happens next.

What National Guard Substance Abuse Treatment Can Look Like

There is no single template for National Guard substance abuse treatment or for substance-impaired soldiers, but most well-designed pathways include three building blocks: assessment, a level-of-care match, and coordination around real-world obligations.

Screening and Assessment

Treatment commonly begins with an evaluation of drug abuse(frequency, loss of control, risk behaviors), mental health symptoms (such as anxiety, depression, trauma symptoms, or sleep problems), medical considerations, and safety risks.

The goal is to determine what level of care is appropriate and whether additional support at a treatment facility is needed for co-occurring concerns.

Levels of Care and Medical Coverage Basics

When treatment is medically necessary, coverage rules and available services can include inpatient treatment, intensive outpatient services, partial hospitalization, medication-assisted treatment, and withdrawal management (detoxification support).

The appropriate level of care is based on clinical need, not just convenience, and there may be specific rules or limits depending on plan and setting.

Coordinating Care With Drills, Training, and Possible Activation

Guard members have unique scheduling constraints, including drill weekends, annual training, and potential mobilization. Treatment planning sometimes includes practical coordination so care can remain consistent and clinically appropriate even when obligations shift.

Using Support Resources That Are Not Formal Addiction Treatment

Many service members and families benefit from confidential, short-term counseling supports for stress, relationships, reintegration challenges, grief, or parenting pressures that may surround or worsen substance use or other drug abuse.

It is important to understand what these services are and are not.

Non-medical counseling can be helpful for life stressors and navigation, but it is not the same as clinical substance use disorder treatment and is not designed to replace it, nor does it serve as a drug abuse deterrence when a person is actively struggling.

Get Substance Abuse Support in the Guard Today

A National Guard Substance Abuse Program is best understood as coordinated pathways that help National Guard members access education, screening, referral support, and National Guard substance abuse treatment when needed.

The question: Are Guardsmen Covered By ASAP? Does not have one universal answer, because duty status and service context can determine which policy framework applies.

What remains consistent is that there are usually multiple avenues for support, and the most clinically sound approach is to match the level of care to the seriousness of need while accounting for the realities of Guard service.

We know this can sound daunting, which is why TriCareRehabs.com offers confidential placement support for guardsmen at some of the top facilities nationwide that offer accredited support programs to support sustainable recovery.

All calls are confidential, so please reach out for trusted TRICARE treatment options now.
