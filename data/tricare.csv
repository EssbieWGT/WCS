Many of the VA’s open priority recommendations are related to the department’s attempts to replace its legacy health records system.
The VA’s oldest unresolved priority recommendation concerns its “incomplete” sexual harassment policies and dates back to a 2020 report.
After the War Department and the VA, the Departments of Energy, Homeland Security and Health and Human Services have the most unresolved GAO recommendations, at 163, 160, and 149, respectively.
About 6% of the War Department’s unresolved recommendations are classified as priority, while 12% of the VA’s are.","(The Center Square) – Of the 15 federal executive departments that compose the president’s Cabinet, the Departments of War and Veterans Affairs have the most unresolved, open recommendations for improvement from congressional watchdog, the Government Accountability Office.

The Department of War, which is overwhelmingly the largest executive branch department with about 3 million military and civilian personnel, has the most by far, with 778 open recommendations stretching back to 2011. Forty-eight of those were marked as priority. The Department of Veterans Affairs is the second-largest executive department, with more than 450,000 employees, and it has the second-highest, with 180 unresolved recommendations going back to 2012 and 22 flagged as priority.

The Government Accountability Office was established by Congress in 1921 as an independent, non-partisan congressional watchdog agency founded to “investigate all matters related to the use of public funds.” It provides reports to congressional committees and subcommittees on various government departments, agencies and projects to inform legislation and oversight.

Those reports typically include a list of recommendations for how the report’s subject can be improved. The recommendations are divided into priority action items and non-priority action items based on what is most pressing or important.

The War Department has some unresolved open priority recommendations from the office dating back to 2013 on topics like the poor living conditions in military barracks, improper TRICARE payments, fraud risk management and sustainment of the F-35 fighter jet program. Of all of the department’s open priority recommendations, it has partially addressed 15.

Many of the VA’s open priority recommendations are related to the department’s attempts to replace its legacy health records system. It rolled out a new electronic health records system starting with five medical centers in 2023 and was “making incremental improvements” to the new system as of March 2025, according to GAO, but there was still a lot to be done. There are approximately 170 VA Medical Centers.

The VA’s oldest unresolved priority recommendation concerns its “incomplete” sexual harassment policies and dates back to a 2020 report. The department has resolved all priority recommendations through 2019, according to GAO records, meaning the 22 that are open only date back to 2020. Of those, the VA has partially addressed five.

Some departments have open recommendations dating back to the early 2000s.

After the War Department and the VA, the Departments of Energy, Homeland Security and Health and Human Services have the most unresolved GAO recommendations, at 163, 160, and 149, respectively.

,,2025-11-22 14:10:06+00:00,Insurance News | InsuranceNewsNet,'Ghost networks' leave Arizona families searching for behavioral health care,Not Available,,,,,https://insurancenewsnet.com/oarticle/ghost-networks-leave-arizona-families-searching-for-behavioral-health-care-3,"Joseph's mother, Seetha DeMarco, said they never struggled to find mental health providers under TRICARE.
""There was a large list, the carrier was very easy to work with,"" said DeMarco, a mother of three and a behavioral health professional.
Arizona is not new to the managed care model, which means the state does not directly provide or administer most care.
In the Medicare Advantage plans, 55% of listed behavioral health providers were inactive; in Medicaid managed care plans, 28% were inactive.
HHS-OIG surveyed providers to understand why they stop participating in Medicaid managed care and Medicare Advantage networks.","PHOENIX -- Joseph DeMarco was about to turn 19 when he first showed the signs of a severe mental health condition.

By then, his family had already switched insurance plans from TRICARE, a health plan for military personnel, retirees and their families, to Mercy Care, a large nonprofit insurer that contracts with AHCCCS, Arizona's Medicaid program.

Joseph's mother, Seetha DeMarco, said they never struggled to find mental health providers under TRICARE.

""There was a large list, the carrier was very easy to work with,"" said DeMarco, a mother of three and a behavioral health professional. ""I didn't contact a provider that was no longer enrolled with TRICARE.""

Things changed after the switch, she said.

""Each and every time I've contacted Mercy Care to identify a provider in the network, they direct you to a website with a list,"" she said. ""It would take days to go through that list and find a provider that is active and enrolled with Mercy.""

She said they didn't find a competent provider until 2025, nearly 10 years later.

The impact extends beyond inconvenience: without timely care, people with serious mental illness often experience worsening symptoms, instability or repeated crises.

DeMarco's experience reflects what federal investigators have identified as ""ghost networks.""

A ""ghost network is really a directory of providers that's just largely unreachable, out of network or doesn't accept new patients,"" said Meridith Seife, deputy regional inspector general and a co-author of the recent report from the Office of Inspector General (OIG) at the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services.

Companies that operate private Medicare Advantage and Medicaid managed care plans have inflated and inaccurate lists of psychologists, psychiatrists, social workers and other mental health providers they say are available to subscribers, the report found.

That runs counter to federal rules requiring plans to keep their directories current. The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services mandates updates every quarter or within 30 days when a provider's status changes.

Arizona is not new to the managed care model, which means the state does not directly provide or administer most care. The state pioneered Medicaid managed care by creating AHCCCS, the first mandatory statewide program, funded mainly by the federal government, with the remaining quarter covered by the state.

The program's proposed budget for fiscal 2025 is approximately $22.3 billion. Private insurers that contract with AHCCCS to deliver most of the physical and behavioral health services to eligible Arizonans are paid monthly per-member capitation payments from those public funds.

""There was a significant percentage of providers that were inactive, meaning they had not provided a single service throughout an entire year,"" Seife said. ""Almost three-quarters of them should not have been listed in those network directories.""

HHS-OIG reviewed plans across 10 counties in five states, sampling one urban and one rural county in each, targeting ""geographically representative samples around the country."" Urban Maricopa and rural Santa Cruz counties in Arizona were included in the report. In the Medicare Advantage plans, 55% of listed behavioral health providers were inactive; in Medicaid managed care plans, 28% were inactive.

HHS-OIG surveyed providers to understand why they stop participating in Medicaid managed care and Medicare Advantage networks. Many described the administrative workload as overwhelming.

""Keeping up with them (administrative requirements) is nearly impossible and clinical staff feel like they are just cogs in a wheel versus clinicians,"" Seife said.

Other providers cited reimbursement rates that do not cover the cost of care, making continued participation financially unsustainable.

To address these issues, HHS-OIG recommends steps to reduce the administrative requirements and create a centralized, nationwide directory that would be a ""single place that providers could list all the insurance plans they participate in, their correct addresses,"" Seife said.

In a written statement to Cronkite News, AHCCCS acknowledged the challenges and outlined ongoing efforts, stating the agency recognizes ""that timely access to behavioral health services is critical to the well-being of our members, and we share the OIG's commitment to improving transparency and accountability in provider networks.""

The AHCCCS statement highlighted ongoing efforts to improve care access, including increased monitoring of network adequacy, reducing administrative hurdles for providers, investing in behavioral health workforce development and exploring improvements to public-facing provider search tools.

The state agency noted that rural and tribal communities remain the most impacted by provider shortages.

Cronkite News reached out to a number of private insurance companies operating in Arizona; however, none had responded by the time of publication.

Seetha DeMarco said improvement must move beyond policy announcements.",https://insurancenewsnet.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/inn-social-default.jpg,N,0.0,2025-11-22 12:56:33.824779

Frequently Asked Questions Does Tricare cover all weight loss medications?","Key Takeaways

Zepbound is an FDA-approved medication for chronic weight management and obesity-related obstructive sleep apnea.

Tricare coverage for Zepbound depends on specific plan details and medical necessity criteria.

Patients often need prior authorization and must meet clinical guidelines to qualify for coverage.

Combining Zepbound with lifestyle changes enhances treatment effectiveness.

Doctronic.ai offers convenient telehealth services that can help patients navigate treatment options and prescriptions.

Zepbound, a breakthrough in pharmacotherapy, works by targeting specific pathways in the brain that regulate appetite and metabolism, making it a vital tool for those struggling with obesity. The medication not only aids in weight loss but also plays a crucial role in improving overall health outcomes, particularly for individuals suffering from obesity-related conditions such as type 2 diabetes and hypertension. Clinical trials have shown that patients using Zepbound alongside a structured diet and exercise program can achieve significant weight loss, which in turn can lead to reductions in the severity of sleep apnea symptoms, enhancing sleep quality and overall well-being.

Understanding the nuances of insurance coverage can be daunting for patients considering Zepbound. Each Tricare plan has its own set of criteria for medication approval, which often includes documentation of previous weight loss attempts and current health assessments. This process can be streamlined with the help of healthcare providers who are familiar with the necessary paperwork and guidelines. Telehealth services like those provided by Doctronic.ai are particularly beneficial in this context, as they allow patients to consult with healthcare professionals from the comfort of their homes, ensuring they receive timely advice and support as they navigate the complexities of treatment options and insurance requirements.

Understanding Zepbound and Its Medical Uses

What Is Zepbound?

Zepbound, known generically as tirzepatide, is a once-weekly injectable medication approved by the FDA to help adults manage chronic weight issues. It targets two hormone pathways, GIP and GLP-1, which regulate appetite, digestion, and insulin release. By reducing hunger and slowing stomach emptying, Zepbound supports significant weight loss over time. This dual-action approach not only enhances the body’s ability to manage glucose levels but also promotes a feeling of fullness, making it easier for individuals to adhere to dietary changes. Clinical trials have demonstrated that patients using Zepbound can achieve substantial weight loss compared to those on a placebo, highlighting its potential as a transformative option for weight management.

How Zepbound Helps with Obstructive Sleep Apnea

Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is often worsened by excess weight, which can cause fat deposits around the airway, leading to airway collapse during sleep. Zepbound does not act directly on sleep centers but helps improve OSA by reducing weight, thereby decreasing airway obstruction. Patients with obesity-related OSA may see meaningful improvements in their symptoms with sustained weight loss on Zepbound. As weight loss progresses, many patients report enhanced sleep quality, increased energy levels, and improved overall health, which can contribute to better daytime functioning. The relationship between weight management and sleep apnea underscores the importance of a comprehensive approach to treating OSA, where lifestyle changes and medical interventions work in tandem to achieve optimal results.

Important Considerations and Side Effects

While Zepbound offers promising benefits, it is not suitable for everyone. People with a personal or family history of medullary thyroid carcinoma or multiple endocrine neoplasia syndrome type 2 should avoid this medication. Common side effects include nausea, appetite changes, diarrhea, and abdominal discomfort. Consistent dosing and follow-up with healthcare providers are essential for safety and effectiveness. Patients should be aware that while some side effects may diminish over time, others may require medical attention. It is crucial for patients to maintain open communication with their healthcare team to monitor their progress and adjust treatment plans as necessary. Lifestyle modifications, such as incorporating regular physical activity and a balanced diet, can enhance the efficacy of Zepbound and contribute to long-term weight management success.

Does Tricare Cover Zepbound?

Tricare Overview

Tricare is the health insurance program serving military members, retirees, and their families. It offers various plans with different coverage rules depending on the beneficiary’s status and location. Understanding whether Tricare covers a specific medication like Zepbound requires looking at plan details and medical necessity requirements.

Coverage Criteria for Weight Management Medications

Tricare generally covers medications for chronic conditions if they are FDA-approved and medically necessary. For weight management drugs, coverage often hinges on documented obesity or related health issues, such as type 2 diabetes or obstructive sleep apnea. Patients must typically demonstrate previous attempts at lifestyle modification before coverage is approved.

Is Zepbound Included?

As a newer medication, Zepbound’s inclusion on Tricare’s formulary may vary. Some Tricare plans might cover it under specialty drugs or weight management categories, but prior authorization is almost always required. This process involves submitting medical records and evidence that the patient meets clinical guidelines for use.

Steps to Confirm Coverage

Check your specific Tricare plan formulary online or contact Tricare customer service.

Consult your healthcare provider to determine if Zepbound is appropriate for your condition.

Ask your provider to submit a prior authorization request if needed.

Consider alternative medications if Zepbound is not covered or if authorization is denied.

Maximizing the Benefits of Zepbound

Combining Medication with Lifestyle Changes

Monitoring and Follow-Up

Regular medical follow-up is crucial to track progress, manage side effects, and adjust treatment as needed. Telehealth services like Doctronic.ai make it easier to maintain consistent communication with healthcare providers, ensuring ongoing support throughout your weight loss journey.

Tricare and Zepbound

Tricare coverage for Zepbound is possible, but it depends on your specific plan and meeting medical necessity criteria. Prior authorization and documentation are usually required. Patients interested in this medication should work closely with their healthcare providers to explore options and ensure proper use.

Buyers in the U.S. who rushed to secure incentives in September left a gap that quickly showed up in October sales. New EV sales fell to an estimated 74,835 units, down 48.9 per cent from September and 30.3 per cent year over year. EV market share slid to 5.8 per cent from September’s 11.6 per cent.

Declines were widespread: luxury EVs fell 39 per cent and non-luxury dropped 65 per cent. Tesla led with 40,650 units sold, down 35.3 per cent month over month, but still gained share to reach 54.3 per cent as competitors posted deeper losses. Rivian recorded the smallest decline among major brands at 14.7 per cent.

Used EV sales reached 31,610 units, down 20.4 per cent from September but still 36.2 per cent higher than a year earlier. Market share slipped to 1.9 per cent. Tesla again led the segment with 11,927 units.

Inventory levels rose as demand cooled. New EV days’ supply climbed to 79, up sharply from September’s 48-day low. GMC posted the highest supply at 91 days, while Subaru remained lean at eight days. Used EV days’ supply increased to 39, though still below ICE levels.

Prices continued to rise. The average new EV transaction price reached $59,125, up 1.6 per cent month over month. Used EV listing prices surged 8.6 per cent to $37,538, widening the gap with ICE models.

The province’s year-to-date total now sits 0.5 per cent below the same period last year, marking a shift for a market that typically anchors national performance.

The decline comes as last year’s rush to capture outsized EV incentives continues to distort year-over-year comparisons. That late-2024 surge also contributed to the province’s muted results through the first three quarters of 2025.

Quebec wasn’t alone. Dealers in the Atlantic provinces recorded single-digit declines across the board after outperforming the market for much of the year. Alberta and Manitoba also saw sales fall in October, contributing to a patchwork of provincial results. Andrew King, managing partner at DAC, said sales volatility remains a defining feature of the current landscape.

“Provincial level sales performances can vary significantly depending on market conditions, but the segment level is where the market is most vulnerable to changing market dynamics and where market disruptions can be felt most keenly,” he said in a statement. “Compact car sales, as one example, saw a significant drop in October despite seeing strong growth throughout much of the year.”

King added that while the market is in a turbulent period, shaped by shifting ZEV policies, trade uncertainty, economic softness, pricing pressures and surprising employment growth — October’s overall showing was still respectable. “October itself was actually a solid sales month, just one that ran up against a difficult comparable.”

Nationally, 159,000 new light vehicles were sold in October, down 1.8 per cent from the 162,000 units posted a year earlier.

The exercise was designed to sharpen medical readiness and force health protection, a commitment to mission endurance reinforced by Mosaic Tiger 26-1. Organized by the 23rd Wing wing inspection team, the exercise brought together multiple base agencies to practice real-world procedures, mirroring the Agile Combat Employment principles of rapid response and distributed operations tested during MT 26-1.

The scenario began with a surge of simulated patients reporting to the 23rd Medical Group clinic with symptoms consistent with foodborne illness following a fictional dining facility event. The rapidly escalating reactions simulated a complex, high-stress environment, demanding immediate communication, medical attention and security action.

""The surge of patients highlighted the urgent need for collaborative organization to ensure that all patients receive the same amounts of high-quality care,"" said Staff Sgt. Jose Alvarez, 23d MDG Community Health noncommissioned officer in charge. ""Our Public Health Airmen demonstrated their adaptability by skillfully conducting patient interviews to close in on our case definition and were able to seamlessly transition to manpower roles to ensure that patients were appropriately placed for the necessary care.""

The key to the exercise’s success was the swift integration of multiple-based agencies. The Public Health team worked closely with installation-wide teams to identify the source of the outbreak and establish proper containment protocols. This interagency cooperation echoes the need to defend bases and protect power projection platforms.

“Preventative Medicine takes place in the shadows,” said Master Sgt. Samantha Henry, 23d Operational Medical Readiness Squadron public health flight chief. “The continuous communication through Force Support Squadron, Defense Commissary Agency, Army and Air Force Exchange Services and Public Health mitigates outbreaks such as the one in the exercise. Because of the foundational work we have established with these agencies, if and when these issues happen, we are confident that our teams will pull together to identify and contain the cause for concern.”

This exercise reinforced the 23rd WG’s operational resilience and its ability to evolve its warfighting unit to meet modern threats. By sharpening Airmen’s ability to respond to complex emergencies and strengthening collaboration across the installation, Moody AFB ensures it can sustain and surge forces in conflict.",https://media.defense.gov/2025/Nov/21/2003830254/2000/2000/0/251119-F-IQ323-2209.JPG,N,0.0,2025-11-21 18:56:58.479462

It's been documented that any type of nicotine usage can compromise not just a user's personal well-being but also affect their own operational readiness status.
Those who smoke, dip or vape can also affect those around them.
Show your strength by asking them to quit with you and let them know it’s easier to quit together.
NHB Tobacco Cessation [360-475-4818] and NHB Health Promotion [360-475-5588] offer tailored support to keep anyone's wellbeing from going up in smoke.","Heard the joke about the servicemember who smoked, dipped, and vaped, who asked his provider one day during a routine physical examination, “What’s the end result of having a nicotine habit?”

“Coffin. Not coughing,” replied the physician.

The servicemember didn’t get it.

Defense Health Agency military treatment facilities like Naval Hospital Bremerton do their best to ensure no servicemember ends up the butt of a bad pun due to nicotine usage.

Towards that goal, NHB’s Health Promotion and Wellness Center, in conjunction with Mental Health Directorate’s Tobacco Cessation counselors, uses the American Cancer Society Great American Smoke Out – held on the third Thursday of November - as a designated date to focus on the perils of puffing, the danger of dipping, and hazards to health from toxic vape vapors.

""The GASO provides a national focal point for our annual public health campaigns and allows us to partner with other healthcare professionals to increase awareness, amplify the risks associated with tobacco and nicotine use and encourage tobacco users to quit, at least for one day, and support breaking the nicotine addiction,"" said Patricia Skiner, Health Promotion and Wellness Center department head.

""Our collaborative approach with Mental Health offers a myriad of cessation support to include education, counseling, resources, and medication,"" Skinner added.

From the initial event in the 1970s when smoking and secondhand smoke were commonplace, the goal remains to reach smokers across the nation to use the date and make a plan to quit, or plan in advance and then quit smoking - and dipping and vaping - for just that one day.

Yet old habits die hard. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the Department of Health, Disability and Ageing and numerous additional highly accredited agencies, nicotine is highly addictive.

Dispelling the prevailing smokescreens is a challenge. Health Promotion's campaign has included several static displays offering visual reminders on nicotine peril.

As an example, there are a host of myths associated with e-cigarettes and vaping. One such falsehood is that most e-cigs do not contain nicotine when in fact most e-cigs do contain nicotine, with some as much nicotine as 20 cigarettes. The American Heart Association notes that another fallacy is that vaping is a safe alternative to smoking. Not so. Most e-cigarettes deliver nicotine, which is highly addictive.

Skinner adamantly pointed out vaping awareness is crucial for understanding misconceptions about the product.

""Many people, especially youth, believe vapes contain only water vapor or harmless flavorings, when in fact, e-cigarette aerosol contains cancer-causing agents, heavy metals and flavorings linked to serious lung diseases,"" explained Skinner, adding that using a vape - also referred to as e-cigarette - product comes with huge health hazard.

""[There's] addiction risks. Vaping can lead to nicotine addiction, which is difficult to break and can make individuals more vulnerable to other substance addictions in the future.""

It's been documented that any type of nicotine usage can compromise not just a user's personal well-being but also affect their own operational readiness status. Quitting improves a person’s night vision, enhances mental activity, increases lung capacity, amongst other gains.

""Brain development and physical health! Nicotine is highly addictive and harmful to the brain and body. Awareness helps prevent issues with attention, learning, mood, and impulse control,"" said Skinner.

Those who smoke, dip or vape can also affect those around them.

""The impact of vaping extends beyond the user! Secondhand aerosol can expose bystanders, like family members, friends, and coworkers to nicotine, volatile organic compounds, like benzene, and heavy metals,"" shared Skinner.

Over the years, NHB’s Substance Abuse Rehabilitation Program team has confronted a variety of reasons why a person started using tobacco. There’s also a host of rationalizations that a user will fall back on to convince others, as well as themselves that it’s okay to still go ahead and smoke or dip. Nicotine does not like to be told what not to do.

Butt, it can be done by anyone who is persistent, patient and passionate to quit.

The Department of Defense YouCanQuite2 program recommends the following six steps to quit vaping [ [https://www.ycq2.org/wp-content/uploads/YouCanQuit2_Quit-Vaping-Factsheet.pdf](https://www.ycq2.org/wp-content/uploads/YouCanQuit2_Quit-Vaping-Factsheet.pdf) ]

Remember why you want to quit.

Maybe you want to quit to break the tie to nicotine or protect your health. Keep that reason in your back pocket at all times. Literally. Make your reason the background on your phone or keep a note in your pocket – personal motivation is powerful when quitting.

Identify triggers.

When you try to quit, certain places (like the bar) or your buddies vaping around you, may make you want to join in. Make a plan to avoid triggers as much as possible and find replacement activities for the times you used to vape.

Fight cravings like a pro.

Some vape products have more nicotine than traditional cigarettes. Know exactly how to fight

nicotine cravings so that when you feel one coming on, you hit the gym, grab some lemon water or call a friend to redirect your attention. Talk to your health care provider about other options such as nicotine replacement therapy.

Talk to your support system.

The people who care about you want to see you succeed. Share how you are feeling - the good, the bad, the ugly and everything in between.

Quit together.

Quitting may not seem like the “cool thing” to do, but as the dangers of vaping become clearer, it’s possible your buddy wants to quit too. Show your strength by asking them to quit with you and let them know it’s easier to quit together.

Celebrate your accomplishments.

Every milestone is important during your quit journey – starting with conquering those first 24

hours vape free. Celebrate these moments because it will help you fight cravings and stress.

Add into the mix that there are even associated smoldering safety fears to consider with using e-cigs. There have been explosions and small fires attributed to them, either due to some type of battery malfunction, overheating, or detonation. Users have been scorched and torched.

NHB’s Tobacco Cessation program - the longest running and most successful in the Navy - has been managed clinically by Substance Abuse Rehabilitation Program counselors since 1998 when it was recognized that nicotine dependence was like alcohol or any other substance and it needed to be treated as such.

We’ll include another somber one-liner to wrap up: Nicotine products are also a leading cause of statistics with over 1,000 people stop smoking, dipping and vaping every day.

Punchline: That's because they've all taken their last breath.

Higher Rates of Autism Found in Kids Whose Parents Served in the Military appeared first on Children’s Health Defense.","By Brenda Baletti, Ph.D.

Children in U.S. military families are diagnosed with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) at higher rates than children in civilian families, according to a new preprint study by scientists at Children’s Health Defense (CHD).

CHD scientists Karl Jablonowski, Ph.D., and Brian Hooker, Ph.D., examined nearly eight years of data from the U.S. Census Bureau’s National Survey of Children’s Health (NSCH).

“The signal for autism in children of U.S. military service personnel has lain undetected in census bureau data for many years. The men and women who serve in our military deserve better,” Jablonowski told The Defender.

“Everyone who wears the uniform knows there is an individual risk to service,” he added. “These findings show there is also a previously unknown risk to the neurological health of their children. ‘The ultimate sacrifice’ has more than one meaning.”

The researchers analyzed more than 330,000 child health records collected between 2016 and 2023, focusing on two questions. Were the children covered by military insurance (Tricare or other military health plans)? And did their parents ever serve in the U.S. Armed Forces, Reserves or National Guard?

They also wanted to know if the parents were male or female, if they were active duty or in the reserves, and if either of those factors affected whether or not the children developed autism.

Among the 333,152 children included in the analysis, 3.19% of children covered by civilian insurance and 4.12% of children covered by Tricare or other military insurance had an ASD diagnosis.

After statistical adjustments, the data showed that children with military insurance were 30.73% more likely to have an ASD diagnosis compared with children covered by civilian insurance. In every year examined, the autism rate for Tricare-insured children was higher than that of their civilian counterparts.

They also found that children of mothers with any military service were 46.19% more likely to be diagnosed with ASD than children whose mothers did not serve in the military.

Children of fathers with any service history were 42.74% more likely to have an ASD diagnosis than children of fathers with no military history.

Among those children, the severity pattern was even more pronounced. Those children were 37.37% more likely to be diagnosed with mild ASD, 45.64% more likely to be diagnosed with moderate ASD and 82.73% more likely to be diagnosed with severe ASD than children whose fathers didn’t serve in the military.

For fathers, the authors documented a clear gradient: the likelihood of ASD was lowest among children of non-military fathers and highest among children whose fathers were deployed while on active duty.

Possible causes ‘must be investigated with all due haste’

The authors argued that because “toxic exposures play a large part in metabolic and neurologic dysfunction,” environmental or occupational exposures associated with military service may contribute to the higher rates of diagnosis.

Although the study does not directly measure such exposures, the authors highlighted several examples of known or suspected hazards within military settings.

Some bases, such as Camp Lejeune, have had drinking water contamination issues in the past.

Other possible toxic exposures include exposure to PFAS (per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances) through firefighting foams; medical exposures unique to deployed environments; or other industrial and environmental toxins generally associated with military operations, and increased vaccination rates among military families.

They suggested that the stronger associations seen with moderate and severe ASD may indicate a “severity-response” pattern consistent with harmful exposures, though they emphasize that more precise data are required to evaluate this possibility.

The authors explained that there could be some bias in the data that affects the results, including: survey bias, where military parents whose children have an ASD diagnosis may be more inclined to complete the National Survey of Children’s Health; selection patterns, where service members may be more or less likely to adopt or care for children with disabilities; or diagnostic differences, where variations in healthcare access or evaluation practices between military and civilian systems may influence how often ASD is identified.

“Though there are several explanations for the results of this analysis, child exposure to toxins, either directly or through their parents, cannot be ignored and must be investigated with all due haste,” the authors wrote.

BACKGROUND

Dyspnea has been described in up to 10–30% of patients post-SARS-CoV-2 infection. The underlying pathology for these persistent symptoms remains poorly understood. This study aimed to characterize changes in cardiopulmonary anatomical structure and physiology that may explain ongoing dyspnea after COVID-19.

METHODS

Participants had a history of symptomatic COVID-19, were between 18 and 65 years of age, and without significant pre-existing cardiopulmonary disease. Each participant underwent prospective chest high resolution computed tomography (HRCT), transthoracic echocardiography (TTE), electrocardiogram (ECG), pulmonary function testing (PFT) with lung volumes and diffusing capacity for carbon monoxide (DLCO), impulse oscillometry (IOS), and a six-minute walk test (6MWT) with Borg dyspnea scoring.

RESULTS

Among 115 enrolled participants, 39 had persistent dyspnea. The mean forced expiratory volume at 1 s/forced vital capacity (FEV1/FVC) ratio was higher in those with persistent dyspnea, but within normal ranges for both groups. There were no other statistically significant differences in FEV1, FVC, and DLCO between the groups. Those with ongoing dyspnea had a decreased walk distance (difference of 50.4 m, P = .01). Resting and post-6MWT Borg scores were 0.9 and 1.3 higher in those with persistent dyspnea, respectively (P-values <.001). There were no significant differences in IOS, HRCT, TTE, or ECG findings between groups.

CONCLUSIONS

This study demonstrated a difference in 6MWT distance and Borg scores between those with and without persistent dyspnea. There were no clear PFT, cardiac test, or HRCT findings that explained these persistent symptoms. Overall, this study demonstrates both subjective and objective differences between those with ongoing dyspnea following COVID-19 that are not explained by standard investigations typically ordered in clinical care for chronic dyspnea. These findings underscore the importance of further research into the etiology of post-COVID-19 dyspnea, including other investigations which may detect more subtle alterations in pulmonary physiology.

Unsere Geschichte:

Die 1889 gegründete Buchhandlung Ernster nahm ihre Geschäftstätigkeit an einem günstig gelegenen Ort in der Oberstadt auf, in der Nähe des Athénée du Luxembourg. Pierre Ernster, der zunächst als Schulbuchautor und Verleger hervorgetreten war, entschied sich dann dafür, die Seite zu wechseln und eröffnete seine eigene Allgemeinbuchhandlung im Zentrum der Hauptstadt in jenem Gebäude, in dem das Unternehmen noch heute seinen Sitz hat.

In den 20er Jahren des letzten Jahrhunderts übernahm sein Sohn Ferdinand die Geschäftsleitung. Nach Ferdinands Tod 1939 führte seine Frau Claire das Unternehmen so gut wie möglich durch die Wirren des Zweiten Weltkriegs.

1958 war es Pit Ernster, der Vater des derzeitigen Geschäftsführers Fernand Ernster, der die Geschäftsanteile seines Bruders und seiner Schwester aufkaufte und so die Weiterführung des Familienbetriebs gewährleistete.

Fernand Ernster trat 1984 im Alter von 24 Jahren in das Unternehmen ein und betrieb die Eröffnung der ersten Buchhandlung der Gruppe in einem Einkaufszentrum, der Belle Etoile. Er trug im Laufe der Zeit zur Expansion und zur Diversifikation der Unternehmenstätigkeiten bei, unter anderem durch die Einführung einer computergestützten Verwaltung. Als erster Betrieb dieser Branche stellte Ernster die Warenwirtschaft auf EDV um, errichtete eine Internetseite und stieg in den Onlinehandel ein. Seit 1999 hält er den Anteil am Unternehmen allein.

2018 stieg Paul, der zweitälteste Sohn, in den Familienbetrieb ein und setzte eine Reihe von Projekten zur Weiterentwicklung des Unternehmens um.

Das Warenangebot beschränkt sich heutzutage nicht mehr auf Schulbücher wie in den Anfangstagen der Buchhandlung Ernster. Die Gruppe umfasst mittlerweile zehn Standorte, die sich an den aktuellen Kundenwünschen orientieren, und beschäftigt mehr als 100 Mitarbeiter. Noch immer als

Select is available to family members everywhere regardless of how close you are to a military installation.

I cannot suggest US Family Health Plan more!","Are you guys near a military installation or are you being seen off base with Prime? (Just clarifying) because if you ARE seen off base, you can switch your PCM to any provider that takes your insurance.

And if you’re being seen on base, I believe you can still switch your plan back to select?

I have the John’s Hopkins in Norfolk. I like it overall, but it can be a pain having to get referrals for everything. I can usually do telehealth with my PCM or with any of their available doctors to get a referral, so I have never had to wait more than a few days for any appt. I’ve had it for two years and don’t plan to change it. I don’t have kids, so can’t speak to that, but I have had to see a few specialists and didn’t have any issues with getting timely appts. The only downside is no one has heard of this insurance, and they’re always confused when I first explain what it is.

Select is available to family members everywhere regardless of how close you are to a military installation. If you are still in your Qualifying Life Event window from moving you can switch immediately. If you’re not, it’s currently open enrollment. You can switch and it takes affect January 1.

When we were stationed in NY, I was on US Family Health Plan under Martins Point. It was the best insurance experience I’ve ever had. I would kill to be back on US Family Health Plan. I could pick any doctor who took it. Never paid for anything out of pocket except for pharmacy which was CHEAP. And due to having a very rare cancer in the past, when it was time for yearly checks, they worked with my doctor outside of coverage range (like over 700 miles away) to cover everything (including CT scans) without needing prior authorization. I cannot suggest US Family Health Plan more!",,N,1.0,2025-11-20 20:56:25.801343

“This bipartisan legislation will provide critical transparency to military families, and keep the rug from getting ripped out from under them.
Especially amid rising health care costs in the Hudson Valley and nationwide, we have to be all-hands-on-deck to deliver much-needed relief to military families across the country.
Our military families have stepped up and sacrificed for us, now we need to do right by them.” The introduction of the legislation follows Ryan’s recent reintroduction of the bipartisan “Health Care Fairness for Military Families Act” in July.
Military families and retirees currently face complex healthcare transitions that can cause confusion and unexpected costs, a news release said.","KINGSTON, N.Y. — U.S. Rep Pat Rayan, an Iraq War veteran, has continued his push to help military families by co-sponsoring a bill that, if enacted, would give “adequate, advanced information before any changes to their (healthcare) coverage go into effect,” the congressman’s office said.

Ryan, D-Gardiner, who represents the 18th Congressional District, has co-sponsored the “TRICARE Transition Transparency Act.” It is designed to to ensure “that the rug cannot be ripped out from under military families with regard to their health care, and that they have the time and information they need to plan, budget, and make informed decisions,” his office said in a news release Tuesday.

“Military families have sacrificed so much for this country — it’s absolutely unacceptable that their coverage can be ripped away without notice. It’s entirely un-American,” Ryan said in a statement. “This bipartisan legislation will provide critical transparency to military families, and keep the rug from getting ripped out from under them. Especially amid rising health care costs in the Hudson Valley and nationwide, we have to be all-hands-on-deck to deliver much-needed relief to military families across the country. Our military families have stepped up and sacrificed for us, now we need to do right by them.”

The introduction of the legislation follows Ryan’s recent reintroduction of the bipartisan “Health Care Fairness for Military Families Act” in July. That legislation has not received a vote on the House floor.

The legislation also aims to fix inequities in healthcare by extending TRICARE eligibility to 26-year-olds and saving an estimated 367,000 American military families as much as $8,724 per year in healthcare costs, according to Ryan’s office.

Military families and retirees currently face complex healthcare transitions that can cause confusion and unexpected costs, a news release said.

Under current rules, dependent children lose regular TRICARE eligibility at age 21 (or 23 if enrolled in school). Families may purchase TRICARE Young Adult coverage until age 26, but premiums exceed $570 per month for TYA Prime and $300 per month for TYA Select. At age 65, beneficiaries must enroll in Medicare Part B to maintain TRICARE for Life coverage — a requirement many retirees learn about too late.

“These transitions often come with little advance notice, leading to missed enrollment windows, coverage gaps, and higher out-of-pocket expenses,” the release said. “This bill ensures beneficiaries receive timely, repeated notifications and clear guidance, allowing them to plan ahead, avoid coverage gaps, and manage costs.”

The “TRICARE Transition Transparency Act” will:

• Require the Department of Defense to notify TRICARE beneficiaries one year, 180 days, and 30 days before a coverage change takes effect.

• Apply to any TRICARE coverage transition requirement, including age-based changes like switching from regular TRICARE to TRICARE Young Adult (TYA) at age 21 (or 23 if a full-time student) and transitioning to TRICARE for Life at age 65.

• Mandate that notices be delivered electronically and supported by an outreach campaign through TRICARE’s website, social media, and family readiness groups.

• Require an annual report to Congress with metrics on outreach effectiveness and recommendations for improvement.",https://www.dailyfreeman.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/DFN-L-pat-ryan-hed-01.jpg?w=1024&h=575,N,0.0,2025-11-20 18:56:27.667897

""There was a large list, the carrier was very easy to work with,"" said DeMarco, a mother of three and a behavioral health professional.
Arizona is not new to the managed care model, which means the state does not directly provide or administer most care.
In the Medicare Advantage plans, 55% of listed behavioral health providers were inactive; in Medicaid managed care plans, 28% were inactive.
HHS-OIG surveyed providers to understand why they stop participating in Medicaid managed care and Medicare Advantage networks.","PHOENIX -- Joseph DeMarco was about to turn 19 when he first showed the signs of a severe mental health condition.

By then, his family had already switched insurance plans from TRICARE, a health plan for military personnel, retirees and their families, to Mercy Care, a large nonprofit insurer that contracts with AHCCCS, Arizona's Medicaid program.

Joseph's mother, Seetha DeMarco, said they never struggled to find mental health providers under TRICARE.

""There was a large list, the carrier was very easy to work with,"" said DeMarco, a mother of three and a behavioral health professional. ""I didn't contact a provider that was no longer enrolled with TRICARE.""

Things changed after the switch, she said.

""Each and every time I've contacted Mercy Care to identify a provider in the network, they direct you to a website with a list,"" she said. ""It would take days to go through that list and find a provider that is active and enrolled with Mercy.""

She said they didn't find a competent provider until 2025, nearly 10 years later.

The impact extends beyond inconvenience: without timely care, people with serious mental illness often experience worsening symptoms, instability or repeated crises.

DeMarco's experience reflects what federal investigators have identified as ""ghost networks.""

A ""ghost network is really a directory of providers that's just largely unreachable, out of network or doesn't accept new patients,"" said Meridith Seife, deputy regional inspector general and a co-author of the recent report from the Office of Inspector General (OIG) at the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services.

Companies that operate private Medicare Advantage and Medicaid managed care plans have inflated and inaccurate lists of psychologists, psychiatrists, social workers and other mental health providers they say are available to subscribers, the report found.

That runs counter to federal rules requiring plans to keep their directories current. The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services mandates updates every quarter or within 30 days when a provider's status changes.

Arizona is not new to the managed care model, which means the state does not directly provide or administer most care. The state pioneered Medicaid managed care by creating AHCCCS, the first mandatory statewide program, funded mainly by the federal government, with the remaining quarter covered by the state.

The program's proposed budget for fiscal 2025 is approximately $22.3 billion. Private insurers that contract with AHCCCS to deliver most of the physical and behavioral health services to eligible Arizonans are paid monthly per-member capitation payments from those public funds.

""There was a significant percentage of providers that were inactive, meaning they had not provided a single service throughout an entire year,"" Seife said. ""Almost three-quarters of them should not have been listed in those network directories.""

HHS-OIG reviewed plans across 10 counties in five states, sampling one urban and one rural county in each, targeting ""geographically representative samples around the country."" Urban Maricopa and rural Santa Cruz counties in Arizona were included in the report. In the Medicare Advantage plans, 55% of listed behavioral health providers were inactive; in Medicaid managed care plans, 28% were inactive.

HHS-OIG surveyed providers to understand why they stop participating in Medicaid managed care and Medicare Advantage networks. Many described the administrative workload as overwhelming.

""Keeping up with them (administrative requirements) is nearly impossible and clinical staff feel like they are just cogs in a wheel versus clinicians,"" Seife said.

Other providers cited reimbursement rates that do not cover the cost of care, making continued participation financially unsustainable.

To address these issues, HHS-OIG recommends steps to reduce the administrative requirements and create a centralized, nationwide directory that would be a ""single place that providers could list all the insurance plans they participate in, their correct addresses,"" Seife said.

In a written statement to Cronkite News, AHCCCS acknowledged the challenges and outlined ongoing efforts, stating the agency recognizes ""that timely access to behavioral health services is critical to the well-being of our members, and we share the OIG's commitment to improving transparency and accountability in provider networks.""

The AHCCCS statement highlighted ongoing efforts to improve care access, including increased monitoring of network adequacy, reducing administrative hurdles for providers, investing in behavioral health workforce development and exploring improvements to public-facing provider search tools.

The Army Substance Abuse Program (ASAP) is the U.S. Army’s comprehensive substance abuse program designed to strengthen the overall fitness and effectiveness of military and civilian personnel while maintaining combat readiness.

This command-directed initiative addresses alcohol and other drug abuse through prevention strategies, drug abuse deterrence, and treatment services for active duty soldiers, civilian corps members, and family members.

The Army ASAP program operates under AR 600-85 to enhance the combat readiness of the Army’s workforce while providing critical intervention services for substance-impaired soldiers and civilian personnel assigned to Army installations.

Our guide from TriCareRehabs.com will break down the details on what you need to know, so that you (or your loved one) can get answers and the proper forms of support.

What This Guide Covers

This comprehensive guide covers ASAP program structure, eligibility requirements, enrollment procedures, and available treatment resources. It does NOT include detailed medical treatment protocols or clinical procedures, and should not be construed as medical advice, but focuses on practical information for accessing services and understanding program benefits.

Who This Is For

This guide is designed for active duty soldiers, commanders, military families, DA civilian employees, and Army National Guard members. Whether you’re seeking prevention education, need treatment referral information, or want to understand command responsibilities, you’ll find actionable guidance for navigating ASAP services.

Why This Matters

Substance abuse issues can jeopardize readiness, reduce individual fitness, and impact overall unit readiness. ASAP provides essential services to maintain maximum productivity, reduce absenteeism, and preserve military careers while ensuring personnel assigned to Army units remain mission-ready. For those requiring additional support beyond ASAP services, consulting with TriCareRehabs.com provides access to confidential TRICARE-approved treatment options.

Understanding the Army Substance Abuse Program (ASAP)

The Army Substance Abuse Program is a command program that implements alcohol and other drug abuse deterrence, prevention education, while providing rehabilitation services to restore personnel to continued military service.

ASAP operates as both a prevention initiative and clinical treatment resource, designed to achieve maximum productivity among military personnel while reducing substance abuse-related attrition. It is akin to similar programs in other branches of the Armed Forces, such as:

The Navy SARP Program

The Air Force ADAPT and DDRP Programs

The Coast Guard Substance Abuse Program

The Marine Corps Substance Abuse Program

National Guard Substance Abuse Programs

The program’s mission focuses on strengthening workforce effectiveness through comprehensive drug abuse prevention and treatment services. ASAP aims to improve readiness by extending services to soldiers, civilian corps members, and eligible family members while maintaining the overall fitness of Army units.

Program Administration and Governance

ASAP operates under the Army Center for Substance Abuse Programs (ACSAP) authority, following regulations including AR 600-85, MEDCOM Reg 40-51, and DA Pam 600-85. This oversight structure ensures appropriately trained ASAP staff deliver consistent services across installations while maintaining command support for substance abuse prevention and education efforts.

Local installation ASAP offices implement prevention strategies that respond to unit-specific needs while coordinating with commanders to encourage alcohol and drug-free environments. This connects to overall program effectiveness because standardized policies ensure all personnel assigned receive military medical services access regardless of duty location.

Core Program Components

ASAP delivers prevention education through campaigns like “Too Much to Lose,” emphasizing alcohol and other drug awareness among foreign national employees, citizen DOD civilian employees, and military personnel. These drug abuse deterrence prevention initiatives target high-risk behaviors such as on-duty intoxication and DUI activity before they impact unit readiness.

Building on prevention efforts, treatment programs provide comprehensive intervention for substance misuse cases. Treatment services include assessment, counseling, and rehabilitation designed to return to duty those substance-impaired soldiers who can successfully continue military service.

ASAP Eligibility and Enrollment

ASAP services extend to multiple Army populations with varying levels of access based on duty status and location. The program objectives increase individual fitness while providing services to maximize treatment accessibility across Army components.

Who Qualifies for ASAP Services?

Active duty soldiers automatically receive military medical services access, including ASAP prevention and treatment programs. These personnel can access both prevention education and clinical treatment services at their assigned installations.

DA civilian employees with occupational health services access qualify for ASAP services, including alcohol and other drugs prevention education and employee assistance programs. Retired military personnel may receive services on a space-available basis, depending on installation capacity.

Army National Guard and Reserve members receive services when on active duty, with space-available access during non-active periods. This ensures readiness by extending services to all Army components while managing resource allocation effectively.

Referral Pathways for ASAP Participation

Command referral represents the primary pathway for accessing ASAP services, where commanders identify soldiers requiring intervention and direct participation in prevention or treatment programs. This process encourages commanders to address substance abuse issues before they impact overall unit readiness.

Self-reporting and self-referral protections under AR 600-85 allow personnel to voluntarily seek ASAP services without immediate career consequences. These protections emphasize alcohol and other drug abuse prevention while encouraging early intervention for substance abuse issues.

Medical referral occurs when healthcare providers identify potential substance misuse during routine care or emergency treatment. This pathway ensures comprehensive screening and appropriate treatment referrals for prescription drug misuse and other substance abuse concerns.

Geographic Coverage and Installation Programs

Installation-specific ASAP offices operate at major Army posts, including Fort Hood, Fort Irwin, and other locations worldwide. Each office provides services tailored to local unit needs while maintaining standardized prevention strategies that respond to installation-specific risk factors.

Service coordination ensures soldiers under other service branches can access appropriate substance abuse prevention and education when stationed at joint installations. This maintains consistency in drug abuse deterrence and prevention education across military services.

What is the ASAP Process and Program Structure?

ASAP operates through structured procedures that balance military requirements with clinical best practices. The program combines immediate intervention capabilities with long-term prevention strategies to maintain the effectiveness of the army’s substance abuse response.

Step-by-Step: ASAP Enrollment Process

When to use this: Guidance for commanders, soldiers, and family members initiating ASAP services.

Initial Contact: Contact the installation ASAP office to schedule an assessment appointment within 72 hours of referral identification.

Comprehensive Assessment: Complete clinical evaluation, including substance use history, risk factors, and treatment recommendations by appropriately trained staff.

Treatment Planning: Develop an individualized plan addressing specific needs, whether prevention education, counseling, or intensive treatment services.

Program Participation: Attend scheduled sessions, including individual counseling, group education, or specialized treatment based on assessment results.

Progress Monitoring: Regular evaluation with ASAP staff and command to ensure treatment compliance and readiness maintenance.

Comparison: Prevention vs Treatment Tracks in the Army ASAP

Feature Prevention Track Treatment Track Duration 4-8 hours of education 3-6 months intensive Intensity Group workshops Individual + group therapy Career Impact Minimal documentation Formal treatment record Outcomes Education completion Rehabilitation goals

Prevention tracks focus on drug abuse deterrence and prevention education for low-risk personnel, while treatment tracks provide comprehensive intervention for diagnosed substance abuse cases.

Community programs hosted by ASAP raise awareness about alcohol and drug misuse and include initiatives for suicide prevention.

This structure allows commanders to match intervention intensity with individual needs while maintaining overall fitness and effectiveness.

Common Challenges and Solutions for Recovery Support in the Army

ASAP implementation faces recurring obstacles that can impact program effectiveness and soldier participation. These challenges require proactive solutions to maintain the program’s role in reducing absenteeism and attrition among civilian corps members and military personnel.

Challenge 1: Fear of Career Impact

Solution: Self-reporting and referral protections under AR 600-85 prevent immediate punitive action for voluntary participation in ASAP services. Commanders must provide reasonable accommodation for treatment participation while maintaining mission requirements.

AR 600-85 specifically protects soldiers who self-identify substance abuse issues before misconduct occurs, enabling early intervention without career termination. This encourages participation in prevention strategies that respond to individual risk factors.

Self-reporting before a failed drug test in the Army is a proactive way of getting support, and our caring, expert staff at TriCareRehabs.com can assist with a confidential consultation.

Challenge 2: Accessing Services at Remote Locations

Solution: Space-available services ensure personnel assigned to remote locations can access ASAP resources through regional offices or temporary duty assignments. Virtual counseling and community partnerships expand service availability beyond installation boundaries.

Installation coordination allows soldiers at smaller posts to receive services through larger regional ASAP offices, ensuring consistent access to abuse prevention and education regardless of assignment location.

Challenge 3: Balancing Mission Requirements with Treatment

Solution: Commanders must accommodate treatment schedules while maintaining operational readiness through flexible scheduling and duty modifications. ASAP staff coordinate with units to minimize mission impact during intensive treatment phases.

Treatment planning includes mission consideration to ensure continued military service remains viable while addressing substance abuse effectively. This balance maintains unit readiness while providing necessary clinical intervention.

Transition: Addressing these challenges supports successful ASAP participation and opens discussion of additional treatment resources.

Neuronetics remains the only TMS manufacturer with a dedicated health policy team, positioning the company to accelerate payer adoption as demand for non-pharmacological depression treatments grows.

(NASDAQ: STIM) announced a significant coverage expansion for its NeuroStar transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) therapy, as TriWest — the regional administrator for TRICARE — updated its medical policy to include adolescents aged 15 and older. The change is effective immediately and applies across 26 states, marking one of the broadest adolescent mental health coverage decisions yet for TMS.

TRICARE serves active-duty military members, retirees, and eligible dependents. With the inclusion of adolescents, military families in states spanning from California and Texas to Illinois and Washington now have access to a non-drug treatment option for major depressive disorder (MDD) at a time when adolescent depression rates continue to rise.

“TRICARE’s decision to expand coverage for TMS to adolescents is a significant step forward,” said Keith J. Sullivan, President and CEO of Neuronetics. He emphasized that the update reinforces the need for evidence-based treatments and expands access to patients who have historically faced limited therapeutic options.

Geoffrey Grammer, MD, the company’s Chief Medical Officer and a retired U.S. Army Colonel, noted the unique emotional burdens faced by children of service members. He said the decision ensures that military families “receive the care and support that honors their families’ service to our nation.”

Roughly 4.3 million U.S. adolescents aged 15–21 are affected by major depression. Treatment options approved for adolescent patients remain limited, giving TMS an increasingly important role as a first-line or add-on therapy. NeuroStar received FDA clearance for adolescents in 2024, and coverage has since expanded across multiple major insurers, including Aetna, Humana, Cigna’s Evernorth, and BlueCross BlueShield HCSC.

Category 1—Active-duty service members.

Category 2—Command-sponsored family members of active-duty and survivors of service members who died on active-duty and are enrolled at NMRTC Sigonella or its Branch Health Clinics.

Category 3—Active-duty family members that are not command sponsored and/or the sponsor is not assigned to a command supported by NMRTC Sigonella. This category also includes retirees and their family members.

Category 4—Other eligible beneficiaries. This includes employees of the Department of Defense Education Activity (DoDEA), contractors, retirees, family members of these beneficiaries, and survivors of service members who died on active duty who are not enrolled in TRICARE.

Civilian employees, contractors, retirees, veterans, non-activated reservists, and their respective dependents are eligible only for limited emergency care and will receive a bill for their visit. However, retirees who completed 20 years of service will not be billed for emergencies.

As highlighted by TRICARE’s official enrollment guide, active duty members must enroll in TRICARE Prime or Prime Remote, while others have more options.","Who Qualifies for TRICARE? Understanding Your Eligibility

Before diving into the registration process, let’s clarify who actually qualifies for TRICARE. This health care program is designed primarily for military service members, their families, retirees, and survivors. But it’s not as straightforward as just having a military connection. Your eligibility depends on your relationship to the military and your status.

For example, active duty service members must be enrolled in specific plans like TRICARE Prime or TRICARE Prime Remote. Also, National Guard and Reserve members who aren’t on active duty might have different options or eligibility windows.

Eligible family members include spouses, children under 21 (or 23 if dependent and enrolled in school), and even some former spouses depending on circumstances. Retired military personnel and their families also qualify, as well as survivors of deceased service members.

It’s worth noting that certain categories such as Medal of Honor recipients and their families may qualify for specialized TRICARE plans.

To double-check if you qualify, the TRICARE website maintains a handy eligibility quiz and detailed guides for each category. It’s a quick first step that saves headaches down the line.

Step 1: Gathering Essential Documents for a Smooth Registration

Nothing slows things down faster than realizing you don’t have the paperwork you need when signing up. Before you touch the enrollment portal, gather these key documents:

Military ID or DD-214 — Proof of your service status or retirement

Social Security Number (SSN) — Required for all applicants

Dependent Information — Birth certificates, marriage certificates, or adoption papers for beneficiaries

Proof of Residence — Utility bill or similar document showing your current address

Primary Care Manager (PCM) details (if you have a preference or are transferring plans)

Having these ready can make the enrollment process much faster and keep frustration at bay. Also, keep a valid email address handy since TRICARE will send updates and confirmations digitally.

A little heads-up: if you plan to enroll online, it’s smart to create a MyTRICARE account first, which simplifies the whole login and tracking experience.

Step 2: Navigating the TRICARE Enrollment Portal Like a Pro

The main tool for registration nowadays is the Beneficiary Web Enrollment (BWE) system. This online portal is user-friendly and designed to make your life easier — no need to juggle paperwork or wait on hold.

Here’s the basic flow:

Visit the official enrollment page, which you can find here.

Create or log in to your MyTRICARE account.

Fill in your personal information and upload your documents as required.

Select your preferred TRICARE plan and choose your Primary Care Manager if applicable.

Review your application carefully, then submit.

Watch your inbox for confirmation and further instructions.

A useful tip: you can pay your initial enrollment fees directly on the portal if your plan requires it.

And yes, the portal also lets you update your information or change plans down the road, which is handy.

For those who prefer video guidance, check out this walkthrough on how to register for TRICARE Online Secure Messaging. Seeing the steps in action can make the process feel a lot less intimidating.

Learning to use secure messaging through MyTRICARE not only speeds up communication with providers but also tracks your health info easily. Worth your time!

How to Choose the Right TRICARE Plan Based on Your Lifestyle

Picking the right TRICARE plan is all about what fits your day-to-day life—and your budget. The main options break down like this:

Main TRICARE Plans Overview Plan Who It’s For Costs Key Features TRICARE Prime Active Duty & families, retirees Low copays, enrollment fees for retirees Primary care manager required, referrals needed TRICARE Select Retirees & families No enrollment fee, higher copays than Prime No PCM, self-referral allowed, more flexibility TRICARE Reserve Select Guard and Reserve members (inactive) Affordable monthly premiums Coverage similar to Select, for Reservists

Now, which one fits best depends on your unique needs. Are you someone who values low out-of-pocket costs and doesn’t mind a primary care manager? TRICARE Prime could be your go-to. Prefer more freedom to pick providers and manage your care? TRICARE Select might suit you better.

As highlighted by TRICARE’s official enrollment guide, active duty members must enroll in TRICARE Prime or Prime Remote, while others have more options. Knowing these requirements ahead of time lets you pick a plan that actually works without surprises.

Avoid These Common Registration Pitfalls and Save Time

Let’s be honest: if you’re not familiar with the TRICARE registration flow, it’s easy to slip up. Here are some headaches you can dodge by watching for these common slip-ups:

Submitting incomplete or outdated documents. Triple-check the expiration dates and signatures to keep your application from being kicked back.

Missing enrollment deadlines. Especially during Open Season, late sign-ups can mean paying more or losing coverage temporarily.

Not updating your information after life changes. Moving, adding family members, or retiring should be reported promptly.

Confusing different plan options and requirements. Enrolling in the wrong plan happens more often than you’d think.

A quick call or chat with TRICARE Support can clear requirements or clarify which plan suits your circumstances. It beats that frustrating back-and-forth emails and helps you get things right the first time.

Expert Tips to Maximize Your TRICARE Benefits Throughout the Year

So, you’ve got yourself registered. Nice! But what about squeezing every bit of value from your coverage?

Here are some insider tips to help maximize your benefits year-round:

Use in-network providers when possible. This usually means lower costs and smoother claims.

Schedule annual check-ups. Preventive care is often fully covered and helps keep you healthy.

Keep track of your copayments and deductibles. Watching these over the calendar year can avoid unexpected bills.

The landscape of warfare is rapidly evolving, and the ongoing conflict in Ukraine has underscored the critical role of drone technology in military operations. As autonomous systems (drones) are increasingly utilized for various purposes, including prolonged field care, medical logistics, and patient evacuation, it has become essential for military personnel to become proficient in their use.

Recognizing the increasing importance of sUAS in modern warfare, particularly for medical logistics and prolonged field care, KACH has partnered with the United States Military Academy’s (USMA) Robotics Research Center, within the Electrical Engineering and Computer Sciences (EECS) Department, to address the training gap in drone technology for Army Medical Department (AMEDD) personnel. This collaboration aims to build a foundational understanding of sUAS capabilities among active-duty soldiers and improve patient experience. The partnership exemplifies a forward-thinking approach necessary to enhance healthcare delivery in combat settings.

On September 16-17, 2025, KACH’s Col. Sean J. Hipp, Commander, Lt. Col. Samuel Teague, Chief, Primary Care Dept., Maj. Wesley Snow, Chief, Pharmacy Dept., and Sgt. 1st Class Jamez White, Non-Commissioned Officer-in-Charge, Primary Care Dept., participated in the Medical Autonomous Care-State of the Science (MAC-SOS) Conference at the University of Pittsburgh. MAC-SOS was sponsored by the Defense Health Agency, and brought together experts from government, industry, academia, and regulatory agencies to discuss the development of autonomous care, focusing on both military and civilian applications.

During this event, KACH showcased their poster presentation titled “Overcoming Barriers: Implementing Small Unmanned Aircraft Systems (sUAS) Technology for Medication Delivery at West Point.” The presentation featured the collaborative effort between KACH and the USMA EECS Dept. to deliver medications via sUAS to Cadet Candidates at the United States Military Academy Preparatory School which lacks onsite medical assets.

“Our research focuses on streamlining medical logistics in combat through drone technology,” said Teague. “We believe that by optimizing the delivery of medications and supplies, we can significantly improve response times and ultimately save lives on the battlefield.”

Collaboration began in November 2024, and the successful test flight took place in April 2025 with daily flights expected by the end of December 2025. This project will ensure KACH soldiers can work with sUAS every day and highlights the importance of leveraging drone technology to enhance operational efficiency in military healthcare while ensuring that soldiers gain hands-on experience with these critical tools.

“We are trying to create a system that ensures AMEDD personnel can proficiently operate the sUAS equipment and soldiers will have the ability to have immediate access to medications they require, regardless of where they are located,” said Hipp.

Furthermore, USMA cadets are contributing to the effort through research and development. Cadets Jacob Crossman, Daniel Orfao, and Anant Sabata presented their work on ""Medical Delivery Drones for Combat Operations"" at the MAC-SOS Conference, which was selected as the top abstract. This work emphasizes the potential of sUAS to streamline logistics in combat scenarios.

“By leveraging our backgrounds in electrical engineering, computer science, and drone warfare, we aim to provide KACH with a practical solution for integrating drone technology into their medical training programs,” said Crossman. “We're focused on creating systems that are not only effective but also user-friendly for soldiers in the field.”

The initiative underscores the need to familiarize soldiers with drone technology, providing them with the skills to leverage these tools in combat scenarios. As drones become increasingly embedded in military tactics, training soldiers to understand and operate these technologies is essential for ensuring their safety and effectiveness in the field.

“The collaboration fosters an environment of interdisciplinary learning and innovation, benefiting both KACH staff and USMA cadets,” said Hipp. “The initiative aims to pave the way for effective integration of drone technology into garrison medical operations to build foundational understanding of sUAS capability among active duty while enhancing the patient experience.”",https://d1ldvf68ux039x.cloudfront.net/thumbs/photos/2511/9399759/1000w_q95.jpg,N,0.0,2025-11-20 15:56:32.630369

Although the intent may have been administrative alignment, the unintended consequences for military readiness and orthopaedic access have been severe.

Orthopaedic conditions remain the leading cause of non-deployability among active-duty service members. Injuries such as shoulder instability, anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) tears, and ankle sprains often require timely surgical intervention with implantable devices — such as suture anchors, screws, and graft fixation systems — to restore function and expedite return to duty. Although TRICARE does reimburse for certain implants, it imposes caps that frequently fall short of covering the number and type of implants required to perform these common procedures to modern standards. This shortfall puts surgeons in a difficult position: Either absorb the cost, modify the procedure, or defer care altogether.

Many orthopaedic surgeons may not realize that a significant number of service members are referred to civilian providers because their care either exceeds the capabilities of the local military treatment facility (MTF) or the MTF lacks the capacity — limited OR time, surgeon availability, or access to required resources. Civilian support is not an exception; it is a critical extension of the military medical system.

Reimbursement rates for procedures involving implants — particularly those performed in ASCs — have changed significantly under the new model. Procedures such as shoulder arthroscopy, which are staples of orthopaedic sports and military medicine, have seen dramatic reductions in facility payments. For many civilian practices near military installations, these reimbursement shifts have made it financially unviable to continue offering critical care to TRICARE patients, increasingly leading to access limitations for service members and their families.

To quantify the impact of this update, the Society of Military Orthopaedic Surgeons recently surveyed large orthopaedic private practices near major military installations. Responses from practices in both the Eastern and Western TRICARE regions revealed troubling trends:

More than 60% of respondents reported a significant decrease in the number of TRICARE patients they have seen since October 2023.

More than half have discussed or implemented caps on TRICARE patients or specific procedures — particularly arthroscopic surgeries involving implants.

Nearly 80% of respondents reported challenges including delays in care, inability to cover implant costs, and a reduced willingness to accept TRICARE patients.

The responses included powerful statements:

“We’ve had to cancel several scheduled ACL reconstructions because reimbursement wouldn’t cover even the implant costs.”

“We used to perform these procedures weekly for military dependents; now we refer them elsewhere — sometimes out of network or out of state.”

“Our surgeons want to support the mission, but the current rates are financially unsustainable for our ASC partners.”

Compounding the issue is the limited capacity of MTFs. Already stretched by deployments, training, and staffing shortfalls, many MTFs rely on partnerships with civilian ASCs to meet the surgical demands of TRICARE beneficiaries. These partnerships are now collapsing.

This is more than a billing issue — it’s a readiness crisis, and orthopaedic surgeons are on the front lines. When service members wait weeks or months for care that should be provided within days, their ability to return to duty is jeopardized. The nation cannot afford that delay in an era of global uncertainty.

Orthopaedic surgeons understand the financial pressures that may force practices to limit care for TRICARE patients. They recognize that the current reimbursement model makes it difficult — if not impossible — to provide essential procedures in civilian ASC settings.

But this is also the orthopaedic community’s moment to advocate. Orthopaedic surgeons across the country — particularly those in practices near military installations — can make their voices heard by reaching out to their elected federal and state senators and representatives. Surgeons can also share their experiences with national and state surgical societies, participate in data-collection efforts that demonstrate the impact of these policy changes, and educate local military leadership on the challenges and barriers to timely care for their personnel.

The collective voice of the orthopaedic community is powerful. Surgeons can use it to restore access, preserve readiness, and ensure that their nation’s service members receive the care they deserve.
