“We have some very, very strange patterns of deposits [from Humana],” Myers said.
“If things don’t improve, we will have to make some really difficult decisions because we have lost our trust in TRICARE and in Humana Military,” Myers said.
Meanwhile, Rep. Jen Kiggans (R-Va. Beach) announced Monday she wants to expand the TRICARE program.
Kiggans wants to align TRICARE eligibility for dependents with the Affordable Care Act for civilians.","VIRGINIA BEACH (WAVY) — The co-owner of a behavioral health practice in the Lynnhaven area of Virginia Beach said “it’s been a nightmare” dealing with TRICARE claims after Humana Military switched its claims processor to PGBA at the beginning of the year.

“We’ve always had issues, but never to this degree,” said Suzanna Myers in a Monday morning interview. She, her business partner and 12 other providers treat military kids with autism at Pennington Group Full Spectrum Services.

Myers said the bureaucratic hassles have entered a new more frustrating phase.

“We are seeing a lot of erroneous denials,” she said. “There has been a lot of confusion, and we’ve gotten a lot of mixed messages.”

Myers said the problems really began to spiral downward in January when Humana entered a contract with PGBA. She had a banking background before her son with autism inspired her to change careers.

“We have some very, very strange patterns of deposits [from Humana],” Myers said. “And when we have gotten paid, it’s been an administrative and accounting nightmare for us.”

Myers said about 95% of her practice is military families, with annual revenue about $1.5 million.

“It’s a couple hundred thousand dollars a month that is kind of in limbo,” she said. “My business partner and I actually issued loans to our providers using our own personal savings because it was just dire. People were not going to be able to keep a roof over their head or food on the table. So this has been very stressful.”

It was stressful enough for some of her staff to head for the door.

“I have lost two providers because of this,” Myers said, adding that chasing down reimbursement from Humana is keeping her from her core mission. “Personally, I love practicing and working hands-on with my patients. I was unable to do any work with my patients for the first four months of the year.”

10 On Your Side reached out to Humana for comment and they did not immediately respond.

In addition to waiting for reimbursement, Myers said Humana recently sent a number of documents with patients’ private information to the wrong address, one her practice hasn’t used for six years.

“If things don’t improve, we will have to make some really difficult decisions because we have lost our trust in TRICARE and in Humana Military,” Myers said.

Meanwhile, Rep. Jen Kiggans (R-Va. Beach) announced Monday she wants to expand the TRICARE program. Kiggans is a veteran Navy helicopter pilot and mother of four.

Kiggans wants to align TRICARE eligibility for dependents with the Affordable Care Act for civilians. The ACA permits dependents to remain on their parents’ plan until age 26. Currently, TRICARE permits coverage for dependents on parents’ plans only until 21.

“As a Navy veteran, military spouse and Mom, I know firsthand how much military families sacrifice,” Kiggans said in a news release Monday afternoon. “The fact that they’re forced to pay hundreds of dollars a month to keep their young adult children on TRICARE — while civilians can keep theirs covered at no cost until age 26 — is simply unfair. I’m proud to support this bipartisan legislation to fix that. Our military families deserve the same peace of mind as every other American family — especially when it comes to healthcare.”",https://www.wavy.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2025/07/snapshot-2025-07-28T194200.880.jpg?w=1280,N,0.0,2025-07-29 00:02:35.889496

“I’m proud to introduce the Health Care Fairness for Military Families Act, bipartisan legislation to ensure adult children from military families can keep their TRICARE coverage until they are 26, the same as private insurance plans.

Nearly 33,000 military families have dependents enrolled in the TRICARE Young Adult program; however, military families must spend between $337 and $727 per month to cover the full cost of the program via a separate monthly premium.","Concord, N.H. – Congresswoman Maggie Goodlander, a member of the House Armed Services Committee, helped introduce the Health Care Fairness for Military Families Act, bipartisan landmark legislation to extend health care coverage to TRICARE (Active Duty and Retired) beneficiaries who have adult children younger than 26 years old, lowering costs and ensuring access for hundreds of thousands of military families across the country. This legislation is sponsored by Congressman Pat Ryan (NY-18).

“We have a sacred obligation to our servicemembers and our military families – that includes ensuring they have the same access to health care coverage as every other American,” said Congresswoman Goodlander. “I’m proud to introduce the Health Care Fairness for Military Families Act, bipartisan legislation to ensure adult children from military families can keep their TRICARE coverage until they are 26, the same as private insurance plans.

By providing coverage for military dependents until age 26, the Health Care Fairness for Military Families Act will lower healthcare costs for military families and establish equity between TRICARE and private plans,” said With Honor Co-Founder & CEO Rye Barcott. “With Honor Action is proud to endorse this bipartisan legislation as we continue to support service members and their families and honor the sacrifices they’ve made for our country.”

Under current law, TRICARE dependents may only remain on their parents’ policy until they are 21 years old. If they are enrolled as a full-time student in an approved institution and if their parent pays more than half of their financial support, the dependent may remain on their parents’ policy until they turn 23 years old or are out of school, whichever comes first. But, under the Affordable Care Act (ACA), children up to the age of 26 can remain on their parents’ health insurance plans with no additional out-of-pocket cost. This legislation would ensure equity for military families by bringing eligibility for young adult dependents in line with that offered by private insurance plans.

Nearly 33,000 military families have dependents enrolled in the TRICARE Young Adult program; however, military families must spend between $337 and $727 per month to cover the full cost of the program via a separate monthly premium. At a time when costs are rising and families across the country are feeling a strain on their wallets, this legislation will deliver much-needed relief.

Act 624 of 2025 was passed in the most recent Arkansas legislative session and is scheduled to take effect on January 1, 2026.
The Monday ruling places a preliminary injunction on Act 624 pending its full hearing before the court.
In both cases, these are federal constructs that supersede state law.
“We’re pleased with the Court’s decision to grant a preliminary injunction to stop the implementation of Act 624,” a CVS spokesperson said.","LITTLE ROCK, Ark. – A decision in federal court on Monday blocks an Arkansas law from going into effect that blocks PBMs from owning pharmacies.

Act 624 of 2025 was passed in the most recent Arkansas legislative session and is scheduled to take effect on January 1, 2026. It prevented Pharmacy Benefit Managers (PBMs) from owning pharmacies in the state.

A PBM stands between prescription drug plans and pharmacies to set drug prices.

The Monday ruling places a preliminary injunction on Act 624 pending its full hearing before the court. In assigning the injunction, the judge stated the lawsuit seeking to overturn the law will likely succeed based on the act being preempted by the Commerce Clause and the TRICARE prescription claims.

In both cases, these are federal constructs that supersede state law. TRICARE is the pharmacy benefit program for uniformed service members, retired service members and their families.

The opinion also stated that Arkansas has other means to control PBMs than the act’s punitive effect.

Among the groups that lobbied against Act 624 was CVS, which stated that it would be forced to close 28 pharmacies in the state upon the law’s implementation. It filed the lawsuit against the act in May.

“We’re pleased with the Court’s decision to grant a preliminary injunction to stop the implementation of Act 624,” a CVS spokesperson said. “We continue to be focused on serving people in Arkansas and are actively looking to work together with the state to reduce drug prices and ensure access to pharmacies.”

An appeal of the Monday ruling is expected.

He is one of the best doctors I have ever had in my life – a perfect combination of being knowledgeable about kidney transplant and health.
Thank you to the entire Nephrology team!” A Heartwarming Reunion Several months after her life-saving transplant, Higginbotham received another heartwarming surprise.","Tripler Army Medical Center — A U.S. Marine Corps spouse is thriving today because of a life-saving 2024 kidney transplant and collaboration between Walter Reed National Military Medical Center and Tripler Army Medical Center. The seamless coordination between the two military treatment facilities, spanning from Hawaii to Maryland, highlights a commitment to comprehensive care for military families and demonstrates the power of collaboration within the Military Health System.

Initial Diagnosis and Challenges

After moving to Oahu following a permanent change of station, Catherine Higginbotham sought iron supplementation due to concerns about fatigue, swelling and anemia. However, a routine checkup at TAMC revealed a diagnosis of kidney disease in July 2023.

Reviewing her records with her doctor, Higginbotham learned that the kidney disease likely began in 2013, following a bacterial pneumonia contracted years prior while stationed at Camp Pendleton.

“I didn’t know the bacterial pneumonia was the cause of the acute kidney injury,” Higginbotham said. “Looking back at my health records showed me exactly when the kidney disease began.”

Dr. Myungjin Kim, a nephrologist at TAMC, diagnosed Higginbotham with Stage 5 kidney disease and recommended she be added to a transplant list in July 2023. After being informed of an eight -to-nine year wait list at a local Hawaii hospital due to her blood type, Higginbotham sought evaluation at Walter Reed National Military Medical Center (WRNMMC). She then returned to TAMC for further assessment to confirm her candidacy for a transplant at WRNMMC.

Higginbotham underwent a comprehensive series of tests to assess her suitability and minimize potential complications. These included blood tests to evaluate overall health, kidney function, and blood type compatibility, as well as screening for immune system antibodies that could cause rejection of a donor kidney. Evaluations of heart and lung health were also conducted, along with a general health assessment to determine her overall fitness for the procedure.

“The good news was that I was perfectly healthy except for my kidneys. That was reassuring,” Higginbotham said. “What I learned is that I had to approach the process step by step. I broke it up into manageable parts, focusing on each appointment as it came.”

Fortunately, as Dr. Kim transitioned to WRNMMC, she connected Higginbotham with Dr. Christopher Middleman, a nephrologist who was simultaneously transferring from WRNMMC to TAMC. This seamless handover ensured continuity of care during the doctors’ moves.

After testing and health assessments confirmed her eligibility, Higginbotham was placed on the active kidney transplant waitlist. Concerned about her lack of nearby family support on the island, she took a friend’s advice and posted in a social media group that supports active-duty service members, retirees and service members’ families.

A Social Media Connection

“I woke up in the middle of the night, sobbing, overwhelmed and scared for my kids,” Higginbotham said. “I was on the bedroom floor crying when I heard my friend’s name, Michelle, come into my mind.” Remembering Michelle’s advice prompted her to grab her iPad and post in the group on Sept. 20 about her kidney failure, saying she needed a kidney donor.

Megan Boyd, a U.S. Marine Corps military spouse in Virginia, quickly responded to Higginbotham’s post just two days later, offering to be tested as a potential kidney donor. Boyd underwent testing at WRNMMC on Sept. 22 to determine if she was a potential kidney donor for Higginbotham.

A Perfect Match and a Successful Transplant

“Every single step, it was perfect. It was completely aligned. There was no hesitation,” Higginbotham said. “Just everything matched so well. Walter Reed was systematic in their transplant center. That transplant center should be world renowned. That’s how wonderful it is. They are caring, extremely organized, and empathetic. They have a wonderful team that works together.”

Testing confirmed that Higginbotham and Boyd were a perfect match for a kidney transplant. The transplant was quickly scheduled. Higginbotham described her experience at WRNMMC as calm and reassuring, saying she and Boyd felt well cared for.

The kidney transplant took place on Mar. 28 and was deemed a success. Higginbotham said she was able to briefly meet Boyd the day after the transplant surgery. Boyd knocked on Higginbotham’s door.

“The minute she came in and I saw her, it’s a moment I will never forget for the rest of my life,” Higginbotham said. “I hugged her, and she hugged me. What do you say to someone who has saved your life? All I could say was thank you.”

Initial Recovery and Return to Hawaii

Following her kidney transplant, Higginbotham spent two months in Bethesda, Maryland, receiving ongoing care with frequent visits between the Navy Lodge and WRNMMC. She consistently expressed profound gratitude for the dedication and support of the WRNMMC nursing staff, who played a vital role in her recovery. Higginbotham also acknowledged the unwavering support of her family, emphasizing their crucial role throughout the entire process. “The surprising thing was how much better I felt immediately following the surgery,” Higginbotham said. “Before I went into surgery, my kidney function was at seven percent. And now it’s almost at 80 percent.”

Higginbotham returned to Hawaii on Mother’s Day in May 2024 and began post-transplant care with the Nephrology department at TAMC.

Long-Term Care at Tripler and Dr. Middleman’s Role

Kidney transplant recipients face a lengthy recovery process involving a strict medication schedule and regular monitoring to prevent organ rejection and manage side effects. Patients typically take immunosuppressant drugs for life, requiring frequent blood tests to adjust dosages and monitor kidney function. Achieving milestones – such as stable blood pressure, normal lab values, and a gradual return to activity – is crucial. Long-term care also includes vigilant monitoring for infections, as immunosuppressants weaken the immune system, and lifestyle adjustments to promote overall health and protect the transplanted kidney.

Dr. Christopher Middleman continued to oversee Higginbotham’s care upon her return to TAMC, ensuring a seamless transition and providing consistent monitoring and support. Higginbotham credits his dedication to her positive progress and peace of mind.

“I wanted to express my gratitude to Dr. Middleman,” Higginbotham said. “I wasn’t scared to come back home, because I knew he would be there waiting. He is one of the best doctors I have ever had in my life – a perfect combination of being knowledgeable about kidney transplant and health. He also has the rare capability of caring for his patients. It’s a combination of listening to you because he cares about you. He is wonderful. Thank you to the entire Nephrology team!”

A Heartwarming Reunion

Several months after her life-saving transplant, Higginbotham received another heartwarming surprise. Boyd’s Marine Corps family received permanent change of station orders to the island, bringing the two women together once more.

“When I found out Megan was moving to Hawaii, I was overjoyed,” Higginbotham said. “It felt like a gift on top of a gift.”

A strong bond quickly formed between the two military spouses, blossoming into a wonderful and lasting friendship between Higginbotham and Boyd. They now regularly enjoy coffee and long conversations, and Higginbotham considers Boyd more than just her donor. She is a cherished friend and forever part of her family.

“Megan and her family have become an integral part of our lives,” Higginbotham said. “I am eternally grateful for her selfless act, and I cherish the friendship we’ve built. I never felt afraid and had a sense of peace going through the transplant. This experience has been a constant reminder of the incredible power of human connection, kindness, and God’s grace in our lives even during times of challenge.”

The streamlined process makes it much easier to ensure the readiness of our warfighters to deploy at a moment’s notice.”

These events streamline routine care by providing services such as immunizations, labs, vision, hearing, and periodic health assessments, allowing service members to stay focused on training and mission tasks without prolonged clinic wait times, according to U.S. Army Staff Sgt. Emilio Rios, the clinic’s noncommissioned officer in charge.

Medical ‘team effort’

Each readiness event is coordinated across multiple military health units.

“It’s a team effort across the installation to utilize all of our providers, staff, and medics to support this event to ensure the readiness of warfighters who attend from across the NCR,” said Matack.

Bringing in professionals from multiple departments and locations is key for the success of the rodeo, according to U.S. Army Capt. Anna Zhang, clinic director of readiness and optometry. “While a majority of core staff are from Rader, we also call upon medics from the 3rd U.S. Infantry Regiment and providers from McNair Health Clinic.”

“Our monthly readiness rodeos provide service members with an opportunity to address all their medical readiness concerns in one visit,” Zhang added. “Vision, immunizations, audiology, and laboratory services are available on a walk-in basis daily at Andrew Rader Health Clinic—but on rodeo days, we have providers performing the periodic health assessment as a walk-in service as well.”

Health readiness rodeos ensure ready medical force

The rodeo isn’t just good for troops. It also strengthens medical staff.

Matack emphasized the critical, multiple roles of his medics to ensure service members meet mission demands, calling them the “Swiss-Army knives” of the team. He credited Rios, and active duty logistics and medical staff for their work to “cross-train their medics to make them more versatile.”

“Our medics and staff get regular, hands-on experience across multiple readiness tasks, keeping their clinical skills sharp and ensuring they’re just as ready to deploy as the service members they support,” said Rios.

Busy rodeo events help them get practice working quickly and effectively, he said, skills they’ll need during emergencies or deployments.

“Our high-traffic rodeo days can help our healthcare professionals hone their ability to efficiently and effectively operate at scale if and when necessary,” said Zhang.

Medics crucial in battlefield and at home

The health readiness rodeo is testament to the crucial trust between provider and patient.

“As warfighters, we would not be able to accomplish our mission without medics and other healthcare professionals,” Simmons said. “Every time we step on the battlefield, we’re comforted to know that a medic is nearby. If we get hit, our survivability rate goes up exponentially when the medic responds to us quickly.”

In today’s high-demand operational environment, that trust is essential to mission success.

“Trust is the foundation of a patient-provider relationship,” Zhang said. “Patients depend on healthcare professionals to fix and address their ailments, which makes them feel safe, creating mental resilience.”

The services offered by the rodeo cultivate this trust, and “ultimately, preserve the fighting force,” she said.

The event, ultimately, demonstrates one crucial constant: the unwavering support of the medics, health professionals, and the Defense Health Agency to ensure warfighter readiness.

“A medically ready force is a ready force,” Zhang said. “By ensuring our service members have every opportunity to maintain their well-being, we enable our warfighters to deploy on a dime to win America’s battles.”",https://d1ldvf68ux039x.cloudfront.net/thumbs/photos/2507/9223400/1000w_q95.jpg,N,0.0,2025-07-28 16:56:11.543333

The seamless coordination between the two military treatment facilities, spanning from Hawaii to Maryland, highlights a commitment to comprehensive care for military families and demonstrates the power of collaboration within the Military Health System.

Initial Diagnosis and Challenges

After moving to Oahu following a permanent change of station, Catherine Higginbotham sought iron supplementation due to concerns about fatigue, swelling and anemia. However, a routine checkup at TAMC revealed a diagnosis of kidney disease in July 2023.

Reviewing her records with her doctor, Higginbotham learned that the kidney disease likely began in 2013, following a bacterial pneumonia contracted years prior while stationed at Camp Pendleton.

“I didn’t know the bacterial pneumonia was the cause of the acute kidney injury,” Higginbotham said. “Looking back at my health records showed me exactly when the kidney disease began.”

Dr. Myungjin Kim, a nephrologist at TAMC, diagnosed Higginbotham with Stage 5 kidney disease and recommended she be added to a transplant list in July 2023. After being informed of an eight -to-nine year wait list at a local Hawaii hospital due to her blood type, Higginbotham sought evaluation at Walter Reed National Military Medical Center (WRNMMC). She then returned to TAMC for further assessment to confirm her candidacy for a transplant at WRNMMC.

Higginbotham underwent a comprehensive series of tests to assess her suitability and minimize potential complications. These included blood tests to evaluate overall health, kidney function, and blood type compatibility, as well as screening for immune system antibodies that could cause rejection of a donor kidney. Evaluations of heart and lung health were also conducted, along with a general health assessment to determine her overall fitness for the procedure.

“The good news was that I was perfectly healthy except for my kidneys. That was reassuring,” Higginbotham said. “What I learned is that I had to approach the process step by step. I broke it up into manageable parts, focusing on each appointment as it came.”

Fortunately, as Dr. Kim transitioned to WRNMMC, she connected Higginbotham with Dr. Christopher Middleman, a nephrologist who was simultaneously transferring from WRNMMC to TAMC. This seamless handover ensured continuity of care during the doctors’ moves.

After testing and health assessments confirmed her eligibility, Higginbotham was placed on the active kidney transplant waitlist. Concerned about her lack of nearby family support on the island, she took a friend’s advice and posted in a social media group that supports active-duty service members, retirees and service members’ families.

A Social Media Connection

“I woke up in the middle of the night, sobbing, overwhelmed and scared for my kids,” Higginbotham said. “I was on the bedroom floor crying when I heard my friend’s name, Michelle, come into my mind.” Remembering Michelle’s advice prompted her to grab her iPad and post in the group on Sept. 20 about her kidney failure, saying she needed a kidney donor.

Megan Boyd, a U.S. Marine Corps military spouse in Virginia, quickly responded to Higginbotham’s post just two days later, offering to be tested as a potential kidney donor. Boyd underwent testing at WRNMMC on Sept. 22 to determine if she was a potential kidney donor for Higginbotham.

A Perfect Match and a Successful Transplant

“Every single step, it was perfect. It was completely aligned. There was no hesitation,” Higginbotham said. “Just everything matched so well. Walter Reed was systematic in their transplant center. That transplant center should be world renowned. That’s how wonderful it is. They are caring, extremely organized, and empathetic. They have a wonderful team that works together.”

Testing confirmed that Higginbotham and Boyd were a perfect match for a kidney transplant. The transplant was quickly scheduled. Higginbotham described her experience at WRNMMC as calm and reassuring, saying she and Boyd felt well cared for.

The kidney transplant took place on Mar. 28 and was deemed a success. Higginbotham said she was able to briefly meet Boyd the day after the transplant surgery. Boyd knocked on Higginbotham’s door.

“The minute she came in and I saw her, it’s a moment I will never forget for the rest of my life,” Higginbotham said. “I hugged her, and she hugged me. What do you say to someone who has saved your life? All I could say was thank you.”

Initial Recovery and Return to Hawaii

Following her kidney transplant, Higginbotham spent two months in Bethesda, Maryland, receiving ongoing care with frequent visits between the Navy Lodge and WRNMMC. She consistently expressed profound gratitude for the dedication and support of the WRNMMC nursing staff, who played a vital role in her recovery. Higginbotham also acknowledged the unwavering support of her family, emphasizing their crucial role throughout the entire process. “The surprising thing was how much better I felt immediately following the surgery,” Higginbotham said. “Before I went into surgery, my kidney function was at seven percent. And now it’s almost at 80 percent.”

Higginbotham returned to Hawaii on Mother’s Day in May 2024 and began post-transplant care with the Nephrology department at TAMC.

Long-Term Care at Tripler and Dr. Middleman’s Role

Kidney transplant recipients face a lengthy recovery process involving a strict medication schedule and regular monitoring to prevent organ rejection and manage side effects. Patients typically take immunosuppressant drugs for life, requiring frequent blood tests to adjust dosages and monitor kidney function. Achieving milestones – such as stable blood pressure, normal lab values, and a gradual return to activity – is crucial. Long-term care also includes vigilant monitoring for infections, as immunosuppressants weaken the immune system, and lifestyle adjustments to promote overall health and protect the transplanted kidney.

Dr. Christopher Middleman continued to oversee Higginbotham’s care upon her return to TAMC, ensuring a seamless transition and providing consistent monitoring and support. Higginbotham credits his dedication to her positive progress and peace of mind.

“I wanted to express my gratitude to Dr. Middleman,” Higginbotham said. “I wasn’t scared to come back home, because I knew he would be there waiting. He is one of the best doctors I have ever had in my life – a perfect combination of being knowledgeable about kidney transplant and health. He also has the rare capability of caring for his patients. It’s a combination of listening to you because he cares about you. He is wonderful. Thank you to the entire Nephrology team!”

A Heartwarming Reunion

Several months after her life-saving transplant, Higginbotham received another heartwarming surprise. Boyd’s Marine Corps family received permanent change of station orders to the island, bringing the two women together once more.

“When I found out Megan was moving to Hawaii, I was overjoyed,” Higginbotham said. “It felt like a gift on top of a gift.”

A strong bond quickly formed between the two military spouses, blossoming into a wonderful and lasting friendship between Higginbotham and Boyd. They now regularly enjoy coffee and long conversations, and Higginbotham considers Boyd more than just her donor. She is a cherished friend and forever part of her family.

“Megan and her family have become an integral part of our lives,” Higginbotham said. “I am eternally grateful for her selfless act, and I cherish the friendship we’ve built. I never felt afraid and had a sense of peace going through the transplant. This experience has been a constant reminder of the incredible power of human connection, kindness, and God’s grace in our lives even during times of challenge.”

The legislation, titled the “Health Care Fairness for Military Families Act,” would extend TRICARE coverage for active duty and retired beneficiaries up to 26 years old without paying an additional premium — a standard that exists for civilians with private insurance.

The House and Senate bills were introduced by veterans in Congress who say it would save military families money each year. The bill has support from members of both parties and was previously introduced in 2021 and 2023.

Currently, TRICARE dependents can remain on their parents’ insurance policy until they are 21, or 23 if a full-time student, without extra fees. Full-time students must prove that their parents provide more than half of their financial support.

But unlike civilian insurance plans, keeping a dependent on TRICARE until they are 26 comes with a separate monthly premium, a rule established by the Young Adult Program in the 2011 National Defense Authorization Act. Nearly 33,000 military dependents have TRICARE coverage under the Young Adult Program and spend between $337 and $727 each month for a premium, according to a release from Sen. Mark Kelly (D-N.J.), one of the bill sponsors.

“The fact that they’re forced to pay hundreds of dollars a month to keep their young adult children on TRICARE — while civilians can keep theirs covered at no cost until age 26 — is simply unfair,” House bill sponsor Rep. Jen Kiggans (R-Va.) said in a release.

The Affordable Care Act, or ACA, requires that most insurance plans offer dependent coverage until age 26. The ACA was signed into law in March 2010 and has survived several attempts by Republicans to repeal the law.

The ACA’s age rules aimed to bridge a health insurance gap faced by many young workers and recent college graduates. According to the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, nearly 30% of adults between 18 and 26 do not have insurance and make up more than one in five of the uninsured across the U.S. This group also has the lowest rate of access to insurance through their employers because they often hold entry-level, part-time or small business jobs with limited insurance offerings.

While many adults in this age range can be covered by a parent’s insurance — which parents often receive through their employer — the children of active duty or retired military members covered by TRICARE face an additional premium.

“Military families shouldn’t have to pay more than civilians to provide healthcare to their young adult children,” Besa Pinchotti, CEO of the National Military Family Association, said in a press release. “Military families are paying hundreds of dollars each month to provide health coverage for the young adults in their families, while civilian families face no increase in cost related to age.”

Rep. Pat Ryan (D-N.Y.), one of the bill’s sponsors, said in a release that extending TRICARE coverage could save hundreds of thousands of military families more than $8,700 each year.

The legislation is endorsed by a host of veteran service organizations and military family advocacy groups like the American Legion, Blue Star Families, Gold Star Spouses of America, Iraq and Afghanistan Veterans Association, National Guard Association of the United States, Service Women’s Action Network, Tragedy Assistance Program for Survivors, and Veterans of Foreign Wars.",https://taskandpurpose.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/9094900_dd9e36-e1753728257232.jpg,N,0.0,2025-07-28 16:56:19.381382

A new augmented reality tool will soon provide enhanced decision-making and training for medics and corpsmen.

A 21st century augmented reality visualization tool developed by the U.S. Army Research Institute of Environmental Medicine (USARIEM) will soon give medics and corpsman the ability to “see” 3D anatomy graphics and triage information as they are treating wounded warfighters in the field.

The potential benefits? The ability to assess and treat battlefield casualties more quickly and more effectively with fewer medical personnel, in addition to providing medical units with a 21st century training tool for enhanced training and increased readiness.

Initiated by the Defense Health Agency Small Business Innovation Research program in 2019, the USARIEM then designed augmented reality software for the Army’s Integrated Visual Augmentation System (IVAS) as a wearable tool designed to provide enhanced training through high-tech visual capabilities for Army combat medics and Navy hospital corpsman. While wearing the IVAS goggles equipped with the USARIEM software, a medic or corpsman can visualize the internal anatomy of a wounded warfighter by projecting a morphed version of preprogrammed anatomy onto the real-world view of the warfighter.

The tool has already been demonstrated at several Army, National Guard and Navy sites, but is currently being evaluated for transition to the U.S. Marine Corps to help wounded warfighters.

BENEATH THE SURFACE

When the IVAS goggles are activated, the user can see the simulated internal anatomy of the whole warfighter and use brief verbal commands to select the anatomical systems that they wish to have displayed in their field of view overlayed on the view of the warfighter.

For example, if a warfighter sustains a leg injury, the medic or corpsman wearing the goggles can focus on the femur, tibia, fibula or any other bones or tissue affected in their visual scene to assist in decision-making, increasing the efficiency of treatment. Another key aspect of this software is that a user can pull advisory text from the Tactical Combat Casualty Care Quick Reference Guide and then list procedural information on the side of the field of view. This has the dual utility of providing more lengthy guidance during training and providing terse critical information that can be called up in combat as an instant refresh to the medic or corpsman.

Recently, one of USARIEM’s industry collaborators produced graphical guidance in the form of a virtual “expert” that appears in the user’s IVAS field of view. The expert’s hands are recorded by the user or a senior medical professional in a previous rehearsal session. Visible on IVAS, the hands can facilitate an expert training of the medic or corpsman and provide guidance for battlefield procedures that require prolonged field care.

TECHNOLOGY FOR THE FUTURE OF TRAINING

Navy Lt. Anh Nguyen, a student in the Cyber Systems and Operations Department at the Naval Postgraduate School, is studying the virtual expert software as part of his master’s thesis, titled “An Evaluation of Perceptually Enabled Task Guidance to Enhance Training and Operational Effectiveness for the U.S. Marine Corps.” Nguyen’s ongoing study is quantifying the effectiveness of usage by providing just-in-time perceptual cues through visual and auditory feedback. In addition, he is recording his perceptions during use to explore the psychological and physical side effects of prolonged augmented reality system use.

Marine corpsmen, like Army medics, typically operate in unique and diverse environments based on mission requirements. Often serving alongside Marine infantry, corpsmen must complete specialized field medical training, in addition to basic medical training. Corpsmen can be relatively young, from 19 years old to their early 20s, as most enlist right out of high school. They receive their basic medical training at the Medical Education and Training Campus in San Antonio, Texas, where they learn their foundational medical knowledge, terminology, anatomy, physiology and lifesaving skills.

Corpsmen receive their specialized field medical training at the Field Medical Training Battalion (FMTB) at one of two locations—FMTB West at Camp Pendleton, California, or FMTB East at Camp Lejeune, North Carolina. This training qualifies them to become Fleet Marine Force hospital corpsmen. The FMTB schoolhouse teaches corpsmen specialized skills for operating within Marine units, providing combat medicine and tactical combat casualty care training. As corpsmen are often embedded with Marine units, their roles require them to be highly adaptable to meet both the physical and clinical demands of a combat environment.

Corpsmen, like medics, face complex environmental stressors—such as treating wounded warfighters while under fire. Cutting-edge technologies like the IVAS can augment their experience and provide additional aids for timely decision-making, including the virtual expert guidance, which can serve as a valuable source of supplemental training or a refresher. The IVAS does not require network or cloud communications and can function in all domestic and international environments. These technologies are designed to enhance knowledge and skill, but they are also created to not overwhelm or add to the stress of the user.

CONCLUSION

The main advantage of augmented reality software and goggles or glasses is the ability to put graphical and textual information directly into the field of view of the user at the moment it’s needed. This approach is a powerful source of information not satisfied by old technology, hard copy manuals, training videos or other traditional training aids. The corpsmen and medic tool is designed to be an application of state-of-the-art technology to provide combat support for medical readiness and to support timely return-to-duty. It is a prime example of bringing information on demand, at any time and in any environment to the user, with the user in control of content and delivery.

,,2025-07-28 15:42:05+00:00,www.nytimes.com,America Needs to Take Better Care of Its Military - The New York Times,"Dan Caldwell, Darin Selnick, www.nytimes.com, dan-caldwell, darin-selnick",,,,,https://www.nytimes.com/2025/07/28/opinion/american-military-war.html,"A critical challenge the second Trump administration inherited is the state of the Military Health System.
The system is responsible for caring for over nine million uniformed service members, military families, retirees and contractors around the world, while also providing care for wounded service members at home.
In March, a military health care expert testifying before Congress warned that without major interventions to fix deficiencies in the system, the M.H.S.
Military housing and health facilities can’t sink Chinese ships in the Taiwan Strait or shoot down Iranian ballistic missiles in the Persian Gulf.
But the administration must understand that future diversions will continue to erode the quality of the Military Health System and military housing, undermining personnel morale, readiness and retention and diluting recruiting power.","For 12 days in June, the United States teetered on the edge of yet another war in the Middle East. We seem to have avoided the worst for now, but there is a chance that fighting between Israel and Iran could resume — especially if diplomatic efforts to restrain Iran’s nuclear ambitions fail. And pressure on President Trump from prominent interventionist Republican policymakers remains to support a regime change operation against Iran, which also risks reigniting the conflict.

At the same time, the threat of war with China looms large. China continues to rapidly expand its Navy and build capabilities that would enable it to seize Taiwan if it so chooses. We are now less than 18 months away from 2027, the year that Admiral Phil Davidson, a former commander of the military Indo-Pacific Command, once said China could be able to seize Taiwan through force. A war with nuclear-armed China would be several orders of magnitude more dangerous than a war with Iran.

Regardless, the United States still must be prepared to wage a major conflict. And while there is no doubt that the U.S. military remains the most powerful and capable fighting force in the world, it is suffering from systemic challenges in a critical component of warfighting success: personnel readiness.

Even on the modern high-tech battlefield, war is still a people business. For the Department of Defense, this means it must care for its people along with developing its weapons in order to maintain lethality while also creating an environment that incentivizes Americans to continue to serve. When service members and their families cannot rely on the programs that are intended to ensure their quality of life, it distracts them from their duties, which inevitably limits their effectiveness in combat.

A critical challenge the second Trump administration inherited is the state of the Military Health System. The system is responsible for caring for over nine million uniformed service members, military families, retirees and contractors around the world, while also providing care for wounded service members at home. But the system has been declining, and budgets for military hospitals have fallen by nearly 12 percent since 2015. As a result, its ability to provide adequate care to these groups and support the Defense Department in a major military conflict has become severely compromised.

Military treatment facilities currently face a global maintenance backlog exceeding $10 billion, which has led many M.H.S. hospitals to fall into disrepair. The Walter Reed National Military Medical Center outside of Washington, D.C., which routinely treats presidents and members of Congress, had to evacuate several clinics earlier this year, owing to burst pipes that resulted from delayed maintenance.

In March, a military health care expert testifying before Congress warned that without major interventions to fix deficiencies in the system, the M.H.S. would slide into “medical obsolescence.” Jeremy Cannon, a retired Air Force trauma surgeon and medical professor, estimated that in a war with a high volume of casualties, “many of these patients will have survivable injuries, yet one in four will die at the hands of an unprepared system.”

Military housing is also in disarray. In October 2024, the Government Accountability Office found that persistent housing shortfalls for military families in some areas threaten overall quality of life and financial stability for service members and could lead to “negative effects on performance and mission, especially for lower ranked, junior personnel.” Other facilities and services designed to support military families — in particular day care centers on military bases — are increasingly strained as well.

The Navy secretary John Phelan was apparently shocked after touring barracks for sailors and Marines in Guam in May. The barracks were plagued with mold, exposed electrical wiring and damaged plumbing, which made the building practically unlivable. That situation is unfortunately not unique; the Marine Corps alone reportedly estimated it will need $1.5 billion a year over the next decade to bring its barracks around the world up to standard.

Fortunately, Mr. Trump’s recently passed domestic policy law includes nearly $9 billion to improve military quality of life, with a significant portion of that money earmarked to address the poor state of military health care facilities and housing that the Trump administration inherited.

It is also imperative that both Congress and the administration resist pressure or temptation to redirect this money to other priorities, as has happened in the past. The lobbying power of major defense acquisition programs far outmatches those speaking up for military personnel. The military, too, has had to redirect money from quality of life initiatives to other more urgent priorities. This occurred most recently when the Defense Department planned to shift $1 billion away from barracks improvements to support efforts to improve border security. That mission is critical to our nation’s safety, but there have been times when the Pentagon has prioritized funds to sustain missions less essential to national security, such as the Iraq war, which shouldn’t have been fought in the first place, and nation-building in Afghanistan.

Leaders at the Pentagon and in Congress must avoid these diversions and the pressure to start more unnecessary wars that further undermine readiness to deal with actual threats to our safety. Military housing and health facilities can’t sink Chinese ships in the Taiwan Strait or shoot down Iranian ballistic missiles in the Persian Gulf. But the administration must understand that future diversions will continue to erode the quality of the Military Health System and military housing, undermining personnel morale, readiness and retention and diluting recruiting power.

The individuals who serve in our military are some of the best, brightest and bravest our country has to offer. This was recently exemplified by the dozens of pilots who flew a 37-hour round-trip mission to strike Iran’s nuclear facilities, a feat unmatched in American military aviation history. But in order for service members to be successful at fighting and winning America’s wars, they must have quality housing, health care and services that enable them to focus on their core responsibilities.

About AL001

AL001 is a novel lithium-delivery system that has the potential to provide the benefits of marketed lithium salts while mitigating or avoiding currently experienced toxicities associated with lithium. Results from Alzamend’s completed Phase IIA multiple-ascending dose study of AL001 in Alzheimer’s patients and healthy subjects identified a maximum tolerated dose (“MTD”), as assessed by an independent safety review committee. This MTD is designed to be unlikely to require therapeutic drug monitoring while providing lithium at a relatively modest but effective dose. AL001 is designed to favorably distribute lithium in the brain resulting in lower exposure of other body organs and an improved safety profile compared to currently marketed lithium salts. This can serve to mitigate or obviate the disadvantageously low ceiling for toxicity of marketed lithium salts that has limited their usefulness to patients and prescribers.

In collaboration with Massachusetts General Hospital as its clinical trial site, Alzamend initiated the first of five Phase II clinical studies of AL001 in May 2025, with the first study in healthy human subjects. Alzamend aims to explore the unique properties of AL001 and its potential to deliver lithium more effectively in the brain compared to marketed lithium salts. The study in healthy human subjects will serve as a baseline and assist Alzamend in determining the best path forward in Alzheimer’s, BD, MDD and PTSD patients by demonstrating AL001’s targeted effectiveness and reduced systemic side effects. Previous studies in mice have shown that AL001 ensures better brain absorption while maintaining lower levels of lithium in the blood, paving the way for safer and more efficient treatments. Alzamend expects to present topline data from this study by the end of 2025.

Prebiotic foods include apples, artichokes, asparagus, bananas, berries, green vegetables, onions, tomatoes and garlic.
Talk to your doctor about any nutrient deficiencies you may have, as these can affect feelings of stress and mental well-being.
Foods to Alleviate Stress Foods to combat stress include the minerals, zinc and magnesium, and vitamins C, B, and E, according to CHAMP.
Foods high in these nutrients are the foods of choice.","Mental well-being is as crucial to a warfighter’s medical readiness as physical fitness. While nutrition is well known for its contributions to physical fitness, it’s often lesser known for its cognitive benefits.

“Overall dietary pattern is more important than any one singular food for mental performance and emotional well-being,"" said U.S. Army Lt. Col. Tanisha Currie, associate director of Center for Enabling Capabilities located at the Walter Reed Army Institute of Research.

Through psychological, social, nutritional, spiritual, and physical fitness resources, the Consortium for Health and Military Performance at the University of Uniformed Services—otherwise known as CHAMP—has tools to fuel for the fight, guides for optimal nutritional fitness, and a food journal to give you insight into your nutrition intake. The resources also provide advice on what to eat to perform at your best—both in body and mind.

Eating Habits to Support Emotional Well-Being

According to Currie “A strategy that warfighters can incorporate in their day-to-day routine is to “eat the rainbow,” a simple phrase that refers to eating colorful fruits and vegetables which can contribute to your mental well-being.”

CHAMP provides simple guidelines to be mindful of what you eat to meet your mental and physical occupational and training demands, such as:

Eat small, well-rounded meals throughout the day to provide your brain and body with steady energy to avoid hypoglycemia and be prepared to handle stressors.

Follow the anti-inflammatory Mediterranean diet, which is high in unsaturated fats, omega-3 fatty acids, colorful fruits and vegetables, and high-fiber whole grains.

Include prebiotics and probiotics in your day. Prebiotic foods include apples, artichokes, asparagus, bananas, berries, green vegetables, onions, tomatoes and garlic. Sauerkraut, miso, tempeh, pickles, yogurt, milk, kefir, and kombucha are just a few foods that include probiotics.

Choose foods for what they can do for you, rather than how they make you feel. Nutrient-dense foods build stress resilience.

Boost your intake of magnesium to regulate muscle and nerve functions, blood sugar levels, and blood pressure. Foods like legumes, nuts, seeds, whole grains, green leafy vegetables fortified breakfast cereals, milk, and yogurt, are high in magnesium.

Eat plenty of foods high in B vitamins. These nutrients support metabolism, brain development, blood and nerve cell health, DNA production, and the development of serotonin, which affects mood, memory, and emotions. Foods like poultry, fish, potatoes, noncitric fruits, beef, liver, clams, fish, and milk are all high in B vitamins.

Fuel your body consistently. Balance meals and snacks with whole grains, lean protein, fiber, and healthy fats to help keep your blood sugar steady. Avoid skipping meals.

Rethink your meal choices on the night shift. At night, your body’s metabolic processes slow down. Eating at night has been shown to be bad for your health, though the right type and number of foods and beverages can help keep up your blood sugar to stay alert.

Be aware of foods or beverages with stimulants or hidden caffeine sources.

Get a caffeine boost, but not too much. Caffeine improves alertness, vigilance, attention, and reaction time when taken in small to moderate amounts. Caffeine may also help mental performance in sleep-deprived situations.

Drink enough water. Water is the most abundant component of the human body—around 50–70% of your weight—so your body needs fluids regularly to function properly.

Increase Vitamin D in your diet. Foods with naturally occurring vitamin D include fatty fish, fish oils, egg yolks, butter, and liver. You can also get vitamin D from “fortified foods,” which is where vitamins or minerals are added to foods during processing to increase their nutritional value. Vitamin D keeps bones healthy and has anti-inflammatory and antioxidant benefits.

Talk to your doctor about any nutrient deficiencies you may have, as these can affect feelings of stress and mental well-being. Too little energy, carbohydrates, and micronutrients can increase your vulnerability to stress.

Foods to Alleviate Stress

Foods to combat stress include the minerals, zinc and magnesium, and vitamins C, B, and E, according to CHAMP. The B vitamins and magnesium are involved in the production of serotonin, which helps regulate mood and relieve stress. Foods high in these nutrients are the foods of choice.

Also, “foods rich in antioxidants such as fruits, teas, and dark chocolate can help to reduce oxidative stress, provide neuroprotection, and mood regulation,” said Currie. “Particularly, berries offer great sources of vitamin c and potent antioxidants. Bananas, which are rich in vitamin B6, and tryptophan are also known to promote positive mood.”

To alleviate or prevent some of the consequences of chronic stress, CHAMP recommends the following food list to minimize weight gain due to overeating and excess intake of high-fat or high-sugar foods. These foods include:

Almonds

Beets

Blueberries

Broccoli

Cantaloupe and other melons

Carrots

Garlic

Goat cheese

Green and herbal teas

Green beans

Grapes

Kiwi

Lemon water

Peas

Salmon and other cold-water fish

Sushi

Sweet potatoes

Tomatoes

Whey

Whole-grain rice

Zucchini

CHAMP also recommends avoiding the following foods that may add to stress, including:

Caffeine

Hard liquor

Tobacco

Trans-fats from fried foods, red meats, and highly processed foods

“Warfighters can benefit greatly by understanding the basic elements of foods that can bolster their cognitive health and mood. However, they do not have to go at understanding the basics of nutrition alone. There are terrific and credible Department of Defense resources such as CHAMP, Armed Forces Wellness Center, Operation Supplement Safety, and registered dietitians and healthcare providers to assist them navigating their personal well-being journey together.” said Currie.

If you already done that check if they have sleep center at your VA hospital, they have one here in St Louis. They gave me a new cpap machine then a number to call for my supplies. Now, I ordered it online via the VA website and they give me 6 month supply at a time

I’m retired and only go to VA for my twice a year visit with my Primary and get my eyeglasses. Rest of the time I used my TRICARE Prime

I am in a similar situation and won’t say I’ve cracked the code on the VA, but would suggest you keep at it.

Admittedly, not everyone’s VA is equal. I am fortunate that my local VAMC is excellent and there is a relatively small Veteran population. Does not mean I don’t have to wait for an appointment, but rather the level of care and treatment is excellent since the VAMC is paired with one of the best teaching hospitals in the US.

A lot depends on one’s rating, but guessing by your need for CPAP supplies, your rating is at least 50 percent. Which means your healthcare costs are covered by VA.

The process for CPAP supplies is evolving for the better. Yes, you have to call a number (or two) to then leave a voice mail, but I am getting what I need as once a year I am shipped a box with a year (or more’s) worth of supplies. (I think VA has centralized this.)

Medications are another thing that VA has taken steps to improve the Veterans’ experience. I like that they are sending me text messages to remind me about refills.

Keep plugging away and receive the benefits you’ve earned. And than you for your service!

I am retired and prefer to go to the VA for most things. You need to get established with a primary care provider and have the first visit. From there, it opens everything up. You can then have that doc put in for a referral to the sleep clinic. You don’t have to be seen, you just need to talk to them and tell them what you need. That has been my experience at least. The sleep dudes at the VA are really nice but totally swamped. Using the message system on the app or website for your medical stuff is key.

120+ Essential TRICARE Messaging Templates for Healthcare Providers and Military Families

Military families navigate a complex healthcare system that civilian providers often struggle to understand. According to the Military Family Life Project, 73% of military spouses report communication barriers with healthcare providers as their primary healthcare concern.

I've spent years working with military treatment facilities and TRICARE providers, watching families get lost in translation between military protocol and healthcare needs. The messaging templates in this guide bridge that gap, offering ready-to-use communications that speak both languages fluently.

These templates aren't just convenient—they're essential for maintaining the trust and clarity that military families deserve from their healthcare system.

TRICARE Enrollment and Eligibility Messages

New military families often feel overwhelmed by TRICARE's enrollment complexity and multiple plan options.

TRICARE enrollment messages provide clear guidance on eligibility requirements, plan selection, and enrollment deadlines while maintaining compliance with military healthcare protocols.

Tip: Consider recommending budget planning apps to help military families track healthcare expenses across different TRICARE plans.

Appointment Scheduling and Confirmation Communications

Military treatment facilities and civilian network providers require different scheduling protocols and communication approaches.

TRICARE appointment messages must include military-specific protocols, provider network details, and clear instructions for both MTF and civilian healthcare settings.

Custom Message Creation Tips

Creating effective TRICARE messages requires understanding both military culture and healthcare communication best practices. Start with clear, action-oriented language that respects military protocol while remaining accessible to family members of all backgrounds.

Always include specific contact information, authorization numbers, and deadlines. Military families appreciate precision and clear next steps. According to the Department of Defense's 2023 Military Family Readiness Report, 89% of service members prefer healthcare communications that include multiple contact options and backup procedures.

Remember HIPAA compliance in every message. Never include sensitive medical information in text messages, and always provide opt-out options. Cultural sensitivity matters too—military families come from diverse backgrounds and may need information in multiple languages or formats.

Conclusion

These TRICARE messaging templates bridge the communication gap between military healthcare complexity and family needs. They're designed to reduce confusion, improve compliance, and strengthen the trust between healthcare providers and military families.

Customize these templates for your specific facility or practice, but maintain the clear, respectful tone that military families expect. Share them with your team to ensure consistent, professional communication across all patient touchpoints.

Remember: All TRICARE communications must comply with federal healthcare regulations, HIPAA privacy requirements, and military communication standards—always include appropriate opt-out language and contact information.

What information must be included in TRICARE appointment confirmation messages?

TRICARE appointment confirmations must include date, time, provider name, facility location with building/room numbers, required documents (military ID, referrals), contact information for changes, and arrival instructions.

How quickly should TRICARE emergency authorizations be communicated to patients?

Emergency TRICARE authorizations should be communicated immediately, typically within 15-30 minutes of approval, including authorization numbers, covered services, facility information, and 24-hour contact numbers.

What compliance requirements apply to TRICARE prescription messages?

TRICARE prescription messages must comply with HIPAA privacy rules, include pharmacy contact information, specify copay amounts, provide refill instructions, and offer opt-out options for future communications.

Are there special considerations for deployment-related TRICARE messages?

Deployment TRICARE messages require family emergency contacts, command notification procedures, overseas coverage details, time zone considerations, and Red Cross emergency communication information for urgent situations.

How should mental health TRICARE messages address stigma concerns?

Mental health TRICARE messages should emphasize confidentiality, clarify that seeking help won't affect security clearances, use strength-based language, provide multiple contact options, and normalize mental healthcare as military readiness.",https://smartsmssolutions.com/images/favicon/favicon-96x96.png#joomlaImage://local-images/favicon/favicon-96x96.png?width=96&height=96,N,0.0,2025-07-26 17:56:08.688271
,,2025-07-26 20:07:57+00:00,kiggans.house.gov,Rep. Kiggans Leads Bipartisan Bill to Expand TRICARE Coverage for Military Families,Not Available,,,,,https://kiggans.house.gov/posts/rep-kiggans-leads-bipartisan-bill-to-expand-tricare-coverage-for-military-families,"“As a Navy veteran, military spouse, and Mom, I know firsthand how much military families sacrifice,” said Congresswoman Kiggans.
This bill will deliver much-needed relief to military families across the country.
“The Health Care Fairness for Military Families Act is a commonsense solution.” “Ensuring our nation’s all-volunteer force remains strong means prioritizing the health and well-being of military families.
This bipartisan fix is long overdue.” “Military families who rely on TRICARE for health care coverage should be treated the same as their civilian counterparts.
Save an estimated 367,000 military families up to $8,724 annually in healthcare costs.","WASHINGTON, D.C. — Congresswoman Jen Kiggans (VA-02), a Navy veteran, military spouse, and Mom of four, announced her co-leadership of the bipartisan Health Care Fairness for Military Families Act, which would allow TRICARE dependents to remain on their parents’ plan until age 26. The legislation closes a longstanding gap in military healthcare by aligning TRICARE eligibility with civilian standards under the Affordable Care Act.

The bill reflects a broad, bipartisan commitment to supporting not just those who serve in uniform, but the families who serve alongside them. Congresswoman Kiggans is leading the effort in the House with Rep. Pat Ryan (D-NY), while Senators Mark Kelly (D-AZ) and Lisa Murkowski (R-AK) are spearheading the Senate companion.

“As a Navy veteran, military spouse, and Mom, I know firsthand how much military families sacrifice,” said Congresswoman Kiggans. “The fact that they’re forced to pay hundreds of dollars a month to keep their young adult children on TRICARE—while civilians can keep theirs covered at no cost until age 26—is simply unfair. I’m proud to support this bipartisan legislation to fix that. Our military families deserve the same peace of mind as every other American family—especially when it comes to healthcare.”

Under current law, TRICARE dependents may remain on a parent’s health plan until age 21—or 23 if enrolled as a full-time student. After that, families must purchase separate coverage through the TRICARE Young Adult program, which can cost between $337 and $727 per month. Nearly 33,000 families currently pay these premiums, creating a significant financial burden.

“Military families have sacrificed so much for this country—it’s absolutely unacceptable that they don’t have access to the same health care as every other American,” said Congressman Pat Ryan. “I’m proud that this legislation will right this wrong, especially amid rising health care costs in the Hudson Valley and nationwide. This bill will deliver much-needed relief to military families across the country. By extending TRICARE eligibility to 26, hundreds of thousands of military families will save as much as $8,724 per year. Our military families have stepped up and sacrificed for us, now we need to do right by them.”

The legislation has garnered the support of more than 35 bipartisan House cosponsors and a broad coalition of national military family organizations.

Supporting Statements:

“If civilians can keep their family members on their healthcare coverage until age 26, it’s just wrong that military family members are treated differently,” said Senator Murkowski. “This common-sense fix will raise the age limit, allowing military dependents to stay on their parent’s insurance plan until 26, the same age as civilians, without a premium increase.”

“As a Navy combat veteran, I know firsthand the sacrifices military families make,” said Senator Kelly. “They’ve earned access to the same high-quality health care that American families expect. That’s why we’re fixing this gap in TRICARE coverage, so young adult children in military families aren’t left behind.”

“Military families shouldn’t have to pay more than civilians to provide healthcare to their young adult children,” said Besa Pinchotti, CEO of the National Military Family Association. “The Health Care Fairness for Military Families Act is a commonsense solution.”

“Ensuring our nation’s all-volunteer force remains strong means prioritizing the health and well-being of military families. A key part of that effort is making TRICARE a competitive, modern health benefit that supports both recruiting and retention,” said Military Officers Association of America President and CEO Lt. Gen. Brian T. Kelly, USAF (Ret). “The post-9/11 generation of military kids are now approaching adulthood. While media coverage of emotional homecomings offered a glimpse into their sacrifices, it barely scratched the surface of the unique challenges they faced. It’s time to honor these sacrifices by ensuring young adults from military families have the same health care protections as their civilian peers. MOAA thanks Congressman Pat Ryan for reintroducing the Health Care Fairness for Military Families Act that would align TRICARE with federal requirements for commercial health plans. We appreciate his leadership and are committed to supporting this important effort.”

“Our military families should not be asked to accept less than what’s standard in the private sector,” said Keith A. Reed, CEO of the Air Force Sergeants Association (AFSA). “This bill promotes fairness and strengthens readiness.”

“By extending TRICARE eligibility up to age 26, thousands of military dependents and surviving children will be ensured access to health care and critical mental health care, saving military and surviving families nearly $8,000 per child each year,” said Bonnie Carroll, President and Founder of TAPS.

“Gold Star Spouses of America strongly supports the Health Care Fairness for Military Families Act to end the unjust TRICARE premium requirement for military families with young adult children,” said Gold Star Spouses of America National President Tamra Sipes. “Our military kids already shoulder the weight of sacrifice, and they should never pay extra for the same health care access their civilian peers receive without added cost. This bipartisan fix is long overdue.”

“Military families who rely on TRICARE for health care coverage should be treated the same as their civilian counterparts. By providing coverage for military dependents until age 26, the Health Care Fairness for Military Families Act will lower healthcare costs for military families and establish equity between TRICARE and private plans,” said With Honor Co-Founder & CEO Rye Barcott. “With Honor Action is proud to endorse this bipartisan legislation as we continue to support service members and their families and honor the sacrifices they’ve made for our country.”

In this role, she provides administrative direction for primary and specialty care clinics, evaluating performance trends and business practices to improve healthcare delivery. As a reservist with the 908th ASTS, she coordinates health services for the 908th Flying Training Wing, overseeing operations and readiness.

""I enjoy knowing that my work contributes to positively impact our patients,"" Hightower said. ""Both of my jobs go hand in hand with ensuring medical readiness of our active duty and ensuring the care of their loved ones.""

Hightower's career began in aeromedical evacuation, inspired by her grandfather, a wounded Army Ranger who was medically airlifted during the Vietnam War. She later became an instructor flight medic, and followed in her mother's footsteps by commissioning as a Medical Service Corps officer after earning her master’s in business administration.

A memorable moment for Hightower was when the 42nd MDG received recognition from the Defense Health Agency for its access to care standards, achieved even with two primary care managers deployed.

""Facilitating teamwork in an already stressful environment is my most proud moment,"" she said.

Originally from Columbus, Georgia, but raised in Opelika, Alabama, Hightower enjoys cooking, baking, and crafting. A mother to a 9-year-old athlete, she often creates items for his team and enjoys attending sporting events, particularly those involving the University of Alabama.

Hightower credits her children and husband for her daily motivation. Her mother, a former enlisted member of the 25th Aerial Port Squadron at Maxwell, who became a nurse practitioner and officer, serves as a role model.

""I am always following in her footsteps to be the best version of myself so I am the best mom I can be for my kids,"" Hightower said. ""She has shown us what hard work and sacrifice looks like while also being the best mom.""

Emphasizing the importance of teamwork, Hightower advises those starting in her field to be patient, innovative, and collaborative. ""Never work alone, and always seek help and assistance,"" she said. ""Stay open-minded, and don't let failed attempts stop you from getting better and achieving your goals.

The general consensus is that the thigh might reduce side effects, if the stomach or arm bother you.","That's fantastic! So exciting to get that approval!

Yes, your sleep apnea probably was the final factor. I don't have the link to the Tricare approval form readily available, but they've got a decision chart to determine eligibility.

I'm not sure what I'd do with the compound. Hmmm. Make note of the expiration date; it's probably 9+ months out. You might use it if you have problems with the pharmacy being slow to fill, but the Zepbound supply is pretty solid right now. I guess I'd just treat it like an insurance policy -- glad you have it, hope you never need it. And be thankful if you only ever need the one order!

When to inject: I've done morning, afternoon, and evening; I have no preference or difference in side effects. I've mainly stuck with Fridays, but have taken it between Thursday and Sunday depending on travel or events or other factors. The paper insert in your box will tell you about shifting shot day. (Basically, every 7 days, but no closer than 72 hours. Just stick with 6-8 days as much as possible, and you should be fine.)

I took mine on a Friday, so I would have Saturday and Sunday to deal with any side effects. My most noticable one was achy shoulders for 2 days, just with that first shot. Many people never have side effects, and most that do have some are able to manage them well with OTC meds and/or dietary changes.

FDA insert: https://www.accessdata.fda.gov/drugsatfda_docs/label/2025/217806Orig1s020lbl.pdf

Re exercise: Add movement that's safe and enjoyable when you're able. Don't over do it. If you're tired, take a day or two off. Or more; some people get a little fatigued. But other people get energized; that's been a ""side effect"" for my friend on Zepbound, but not for me, lol.

I think that's what I've got for your questions. Here are some of my other top tips:

Read the FAQ and the Beginner’s Guide; there’s a lot of great info there. https://www.reddit.com/r/Zepbound/wiki/index/faq/ and https://www.reddit.com/r/Zepbound/wiki/index/beginners-guide/

The Beginner's Guide has a great spreadsheet, with a page for measurements. Take measurements, and take pics; they'll help you see/quantify progress when the scale or mirror aren't showing you what you want. Pics can go in a Locked or Private album if you don't want them in your main camera roll.

If you’re interested in free mail-back sharps containers, request one here -- https://www.pureway.com/novocare-rx-system-request-page -- select “1.2 gallon sharps disposal system.” You can also check https://med-project.org for free mail-back sharps containers.

Watch for NSVs -- non-scale victories. It's exciting when clothes start getting loose, you can get off the floor easily, don't need a seatbelt extender on an airplane, etc.

You and your dr should be on the same page re titration (stepping up in strength). Here's the prescribing info: ""With multiple options, you and your doctor can work together to find the once-weekly dose of Zepbound that fits your body's changing needs. Zepbound dosing is increased gradually over time. You’ll begin treatment at a recommended 2.5 mg starting dose. After 4 weeks, your doctor will increase your dose to 5 mg. Your doctor may increase the dosage in 2.5 mg increments after at least 4 weeks on the current dose until recommended maintenance dosage is achieved.” Going up after 5.0 is a ""may,"" not a ""will"" -- many people find a ""sweet spot"" dosage below 15 that works for months. https://zepbound.lilly.com/weight/how-to-use

I suggest you reread the package insert and injection directions before shots #2 and #3. Some people forget to remove the gray pen cap for their second or third dose, and it is SAD to waste a dose. I take a look at the needle tip as verification that I've removed the cap. :) (Not an issue with the vials, of course.)

Lilly has great videos teaching how to use the pen and the vials. https://zepbound.lilly.com/support-resources

Here’s the Instructions For Use, with pics on how to inject: https://pi.lilly.com/us/zepbound-pen-us-ifu.pdf

Here's one way to do the back of your arm yourself: https://www.youtube.com/shorts/T26Wmg9_EFw -- I also just kind of ""hug"" myself to reach the back of my arm, but that depends on your range of motion.

You can try all the injection sites and see what you think. I've tried them all with no significant difference. The general consensus is that the thigh might reduce side effects, if the stomach or arm bother you. And the arm is kinda inconvenient, lol. But see what you like.

Every photo field is covered by the Keywords search routine.

The Keywords field is ideal for searching for such specifics as aircraft registrations, photographers' names, specific airport/city names, specific paintschemes (i.e. 'Wunala Dreaming'), etc.

To use the Keywords field, begin by selecting a Keyworld search field. You may select either a specific database field (airline, aircraft, etc.), or choose to match your keyword to all database fields.

Next, select a Keyword limiter. There are three options from which to choose:

- is exactly

- starts with

- contains

Select the appropriate limiter for your search, then enter the keyword(s) you wish to search in the box on the right.

The Keywords search field is not case-sensitive.

Use this option to include only photos taken in a specific year in your search.

This pulldown menu, in addition to each year available as a search limiter, also shows the number of photos currently in the database for each specific year, enclosed in brackets. For example, an option of:

- 2003 [55000]

.. indicates that there are 55,000 total photos taken in the year 2003 currently in the database.

*Note: The total number of photos, enclosed in brackets, is updated four (4) times hourly, and may be slightly inaccurate.

Additionally, decade ranges (1990-1999, etc.) are available as selections in this menu. Selecting a decade range will show all photos matching your other search criteria from the selected decade.

The 'All Years' selection is the default selection for this option.",https://www.jetphotos.com/assets/img/logo-social.png,N,0.0,2025-07-26 12:56:18.937484

,,2025-07-26 09:32:46+00:00,Catalunya Diari EN,Official: This SSA update on Medicare catches the attention of many Americans - Catalunya Diari,Another Take,,,,,https://catalunyadiari.com/en/news/demonstrated-progress-ssa-tricare-medical-care-program,"Through new announcements, the agency points out that Tricare is not exclusive to active military members, but also covers retirees, family members, National Guard members, and Social Reservists.
Conditions to meet to access Tricare The SSA clarifies that, upon turning 65 years old, military retirees must enroll in Medicare Part A and B to keep their Tricare active (known as Tricare For Life).
When both programs cover the same service, Medicare pays first and Tricare covers the remainder.
The SSA has started to actively inform about how Tricare can be integrated with Medicare.
Tricare expands coverage: there are services covered that Medicare doesn't offer, and Tricare can cover copays or additional expenses.","The Social Security Administration (SSA) in the United States has led a major advancement in the information they provide about a program that interests many citizens. This advancement is generating relief and satisfaction among thousands of Americans.

In essence, the SSA is promoting greater awareness of the real meaning of Tricare, how it works, and who can be beneficiaries. Through new announcements, the agency points out that Tricare is not exclusive to active military members, but also covers retirees, family members, National Guard members, and Social Reservists.

Important message from the SSA: everything you need to know about Tricare

Tricare, managed by the Defense Health Agency (DHA), provides comprehensive medical care: doctors, hospitals, mental health, pharmacy services, and even vaccines, including against flu and shingles. This allows many families in the military community to access a level of care similar to Medicare, but with extensive additional coverage.

The program is aimed at several categories: active duty armed forces personnel, retirees with or without 65 years old, their spouses, children, and survivors. It also covers National Guard members and Reservists.

Conditions to meet to access Tricare

The SSA clarifies that, upon turning 65 years old, military retirees must enroll in Medicare Part A and B to keep their Tricare active (known as Tricare For Life). If they don't do so, they may face penalties and lose medical coverage.

This requirement is vital: without enrollment in Medicare B, Tricare will become a secondary payer, and some services could be out of reach. When both programs cover the same service, Medicare pays first and Tricare covers the remainder.

The SSA has started to actively inform about how Tricare can be integrated with Medicare. They have published guides in Spanish and conduct educational campaigns so beneficiaries understand their benefits. This way, they explain the exact meaning of access and the necessary conditions, avoiding confusion and mistakes in enrollment dates.

Why should you consider this option?

Tricare expands coverage: there are services covered that Medicare doesn't offer, and Tricare can cover copays or additional expenses. Having both programs reduces direct costs for the beneficiary and it's vital to meet the conditions and avoid losing access due to delays or lack of knowledge.

For families with a military connection, this can mean access to high-quality medical care, without surprises or unexpected costs. It's thanks to better information from the SSA that many people are discovering this double coverage they can have without excessive expenses.",https://catalunyadiari.com/filesedc/uploads/image/post/2025/07/estados-unidos-seguridad-social-jubilado_1200_800.webp,N,0.0,2025-07-26 14:56:16.153690
