This group establishes unified, high-quality standards for perioperative services across all hospitals and clinics within the Military Health System. By creating the same rules and processes for all operating rooms, the DHA ORESC helps the MHS deliver safe and high-quality care to beneficiaries.

What Is the DHA ORESC?

The DHA ORESC is a team of surgeons, nurses, and anesthesiologists from all nine defense health networks. Their job is to equip ORs with the resourcing and guidance to meet the needs of patients.

“As a nurse nominee, being part of the ORESC ensures that the voices of the nursing staff are heard in key decisions,” said Natalee Day, chief nurse of William Beaumont Army Medical Center – Fort Bliss. “I have the opportunity to advocate for processes that directly impact our team and patient care.”

How the DHA ORESC Works

The DHA ORESC acts as a central decision-making body to standardize processes across the MHS. Members from every DHN share ideas and challenges from their military hospitals and clinics. This teamwork helps create standards that work for most military hospitals and clinics and advance the larger goals of the MHS.

The DHA ORESC also focuses on accountability. U.S. Air Force Lt. Col. Robert McGill, orthopaedic arthroplasty surgeon and DHA’s Surgical Clinical Management Team chief serving as the acting DHA ORESC chair said the committee:

• Hears concerns

• Shares successes

• Leads policy decision making

Every DHN receives one vote for decision making. These decisions improve patient safety and quality of care while also enhancing military medical readiness and resource use.

“By centralizing decision making and standardizing processes, the DHA ORESC ensures that every facility within the MHS knows the steps to operate at the highest level of efficiency and safety,” McGill explained.

Why the DHA ORESC is Important

The DHA ORESC’s work has big benefits:

• Safer surgeries: By creating perioperative best practices, the DHA ORESC makes sure all patients get safe, high-quality care.

• Faster decisions: The group’s clear structure helps solve problems quickly while keeping everyone accountable.

• Better use of resources: Consistent processes and good planning help military hospitals and clinics meet patient needs and keep service members ready.

“The ORESC’s initiatives not only improve surgical care, but also strengthen the overall readiness of our military health care system,” said Dr. Adrienne Cummings, deputy chair of the department of anesthesia at Brooke Army Medical Center. “It’s a win for patients, providers, and the mission.”

The DHA ORESC Impact

The DHA ORESC’s work supports the DHA’s goal of quality care to patients and service member readiness. By improving how military hospitals and clinics run, the DHA ORESC helps keep the military health care system strong and dependable.

“The ORESC has been an invaluable platform for sharing challenges and solutions across networks,” said U.S. Navy Capt. James Solomon, pediatric anesthesiologist, Walter Reed National Military Medical Center, “We all face similar obstacles and are at different stages in developing our network-level OR committees. By collaborating, we ensure that all networks move in the same direction toward optimizing OR operations.”

What’s Next

The DHA ORESC is committed to making surgeries safer, more efficient, and better for everyone. As the team keeps working together, its goal is for surgical care to be top-notch for both patients and providers.",https://militarymedical.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/8941392.jpg,N,1.0,2025-06-23 11:56:25.609074

Tricare will not cover elective abortions. If it’s a medically necessary procedure to save the mother’s life, yes. But then you face the hardship of somebody who will do it. Some doctors use their personal beliefs and their fear of prosecution dictate what they’ll do.

For the most part tricare covers medically necessary medical procedures.

If you choose to seek an abortion electively, that’s completely on you. Travel if necessary and the costs of the procedure.

You can also google “tricare abortion” and find the tricare website explaining.

Oh well that’s shitty! Sorry that happened to you! Sometimes people interpret things in a way we didn’t intend and then everyone runs with it 😩

So pregnant or not, you have the option of Prime vs Select. I have select, so I’m not sure how it works with prime, but I picked my own OB and birthing hospital (lmao I actually WANTED to give birth at the MTF here and they said nope, deferred to the civilian network byeeeee). I didn’t need any referrals and for the most part, they’ve covered everything — but I’m also high risk due to AMA. There’s also birth doula coverage! And def check out parenting and birthing classes offered through your nearest MTF with a birthing center.

For anyone who is wondering, I don’t think any Tricare plan covers TFMR for abnormalities not compatible with life unless they endanger the mother’s life, or the pregnancy is a result of rape or incest.

I would not ask any personal questions on the base or ship Facebook page 🙏. To protect yourself and your sailor. I know you said others do it, that's not something I've seen on any of my pages.

Long story short, I have an ankle injury that’s been bothering me for a month so I went to my Tricare Prime PCM and was scheduled for an MRI. My left leg has lost a lot of muscle and I struggle to walk.

To my understanding, prime pays for the imaging since it was a referral, but I will need to make copays for the physical therapy sessions to come.

Here’s a breakdown of what you need to know to make informed decisions about your health coverage.

CHAMPVA & Medicare Advantage

CHAMPVA (Civilian Health and Medical Program of the Department of Veterans Affairs) can serve as a secondary payer when you’re enrolled in another health plan, such as a Medicare Advantage plan. This means CHAMPVA helps cover out-of-pocket costs like deductibles, co-pays, and coinsurance after your primary plan pays.

Most healthcare providers will bill your Medicare Advantage plan first, and CHAMPVA will pick up the remaining balance. However, there are exceptions. If you're also covered by Medicaid, Indian Health Services, or certain crime victim benefits, CHAMPVA may act as your primary payer.

Other Insurance Certification Form – VA Form 10-7959c

TRICARE For Life & Medicare Advantage

Good news for TRICARE For Life beneficiaries: enrolling in Medicare Advantage does not affect your TRICARE coverage. Medicare Advantage becomes your primary insurer, while TFL acts as a secondary payer for TRICARE-covered services.

However, unlike Original Medicare, Medicare Advantage claims do not automatically crossover to TRICARE. This means you may have to manually file claims with TRICARE For Life for reimbursement, unless your provider or Medicare Advantage Health Plan carrier is willing to submit those claims for you on your behalf.

If you receive care through the VA, you can also use Medicare Advantage, Medicaid, or private insurance. While the VA doesn’t bill Medicare, they may bill yourprivate insurance for care provided for non-service-connected conditions.

Providing your health insurance details to the VA can help reduce copayments and improve care coordination. Importantly, your insurance status doesn’t impact your eligibility for VA health care benefits.

Dear Rusty: In your answer to the retired U.S. Navy veteran about why he is forced to enroll in Medicare, you focused on military TriCare’s requirement for the member to enroll in Medicare. But you said nothing about regular VA health care. If a non-career veteran is eligible for VA health care, couldn’t that be used in place of Medicare? Signed: Veteran Advocate

Dear Veteran Advocate: Thank you for your feedback. FYI, I have previously explained numerous times that veterans who rely on the VA for 100% of their healthcare can, indeed, disenroll from Medicare Part B (thus saving the monthly Part B premium). I don’t personally recommend it because of my personal experience, but it certainly is possible to do so.

Personally, I use the VA for some of my healthcare needs – usually an annual checkup and optometry services – at my local VA clinic which is only a mile away from where I live. But for any extensive treatment needs (medical tests, etc.) I must travel about 40 miles to the nearest VA hospital facility. For contrast, I have numerous private healthcare services, specialists, and hospitals very near where I live, but to use them under the VA I must get VA preapproval and use only certain VA-approved providers, which is inconvenient for me. Personally, I prefer the freedom to go to any healthcare service provider I choose, without restriction, at any time I need to. So, I use my VA coverage when it is convenient for me but rely also on non-VA, Medicare-approved specialists who I can choose to use (or not) at will. For me, it’s a matter of convenience and the freedom to use whichever healthcare provider I want. That said, I fully understand that some veterans rely exclusively on the VA for their healthcare needs, and I have explained to many who have written to me that they have that option. I have also published several public articles about this as well.

So, please rest assured that we regularly advise our veterans about their healthcare options under Medicare, including the ability to decline Medicare Part B coverage if they have full VA healthcare coverage. FYI, free Medicare Part A (inpatient hospitalization coverage) is mandatory to collect Social Security after age 65, but Medicare Part B coverage is always optional because there is a premium associated with Part B. A veteran can decline Medicare Part B coverage and save that monthly premium, but they would need to contact Social Security to do so. Social Security will want to interview the veteran to ensure they are aware of the potential financial consequences of not having Medicare Part B. And they may need to file form CMS-1763 (Request for Termination) But a non-career veteran can opt out of Medicare Part B if they get all of their healthcare services through the Veterans Administration.",https://jocoreport.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Social-Security-Ask-Rusty-10-04-18CP-1.jpg,N,0.0,2025-06-22 13:56:15.784746

""When we ensure fair, competitive pricing for military healthcare, we strengthen both our commitment to those who serve and our responsibility to ourselves as taxpayers.","Pharmacists United for Truth and Transparency calls for national conversation on massive price differences between cash-pay generics and Tricare PBM charges

(PHOENIX, AZ) – [JUNE 16, 2025] – Pharmacists United for Truth and Transparency (PUTT) today announced the launch of its ""Audit TRICARE"" campaign (AuditTRICARE.org), a critical initiative designed to bring transparency to questionable pharmacy benefit manager (PBM) pricing practices that may be costing taxpayers millions while affecting healthcare access for military families.

Using real-time pricing examples and state-based infographics, the campaign aims to start a national conversation about the stark price differences between common generic medications purchased without insurance and the prices charged to the federal government by TRICARE's PBM, Express Scripts. PUTT members whose families are on TRICARE or TRICARE for Life, sourced drug pricing information through TRICARE’s prescription drug pricing portal, comparing the cost of generic medications on TRICARE versus without insurance at pharmacies like Mark Cuban Cost Plus Drugs, Blueberry Pharmacy and DiRx, who provide their medication cash price online.

Exposing Hidden Healthcare Costs

PUTT's preliminary research revealed significant disparities in generic medication pricing that demand immediate attention:

Amlodipine, a commonly prescribed generic blood pressure medication, costs $213.60 on Tricare but less than $6 for the same medication (dose and quantity) at Mark Cuban Cost Plus Drugs

Fluoxetine, the generic version of Prozac®, costs $235.32 on Tricare but $7.74 for the same medication at Blueberry Pharmacy

Omeprazole, a commonly prescribed acid reflux medication, costs $665.58 on Tricare but $14.06 at DiRx

“While civilians can often purchase common generic medications at competitive cash prices, the federal government—through TRICARE—appears to be paying substantially more for identical medications through Express Scripts' managed formulary system,” said PUTT Executive Director Monique Whitney, whose family members’ military service includes the Marines and the Navy. ""This creates a troubling situation where the government serves as both the plan sponsor funding these purchases and the entity responsible for oversight, yet lacks transparency mechanisms to ensure fair pricing. We urge the Department of Defense to conduct an independent audit of TRICARE’s prescription drug program to understand why our military’s prescription medications are so expensive.”

Campaign Objectives

Through the ""Audit TRICARE"" campaign, PUTT aims to:

Demand Transparency: Call for clear, public reporting on the factors contributing to the prescription drug pricing within the TRICARE system, including detailed breakdowns of PBM fees, rebates, and administrative costs

Encourage Oversight: Advocate for federal agencies to regularly and independently audit PBM pricing practices to ensure competitive, fair pricing for generic medications

Protect Military Families: Ensure healthcare decisions - including the patient’s choice of pharmacy - are based on the patient’s best interest, not profit margins or self-dealing business arrangements

Safeguard Taxpayer Dollars: At a time when the federal government is seeking greater fiscal responsibility, ensure government healthcare contractors are acting as fiduciaries, using fair pricing practices and preserving access for service members, veterans and their families

The Stakes for Military Healthcare

The prescription drug pricing disparities highlighted by the campaign have far-reaching implications:

Military families may pay significantly more for common generic medications as a way to offset somewhat lower brand medication prices on TRICARE

Taxpayers fund potentially inflated prescription costs without visibility into pricing rationale

Healthcare resources that could serve more military families may be diverted to pay for excessive PBM administrative costs

""Our military families deserve healthcare transparency, and American taxpayers deserve to know how their dollars are being spent on prescription medications,"" said PUTT’s President Deborah Keaveny, whose daughter is currently on active duty in the Middle East. ""When PBMs operate with limited oversight and zero pricing transparency, everyone loses except the middleman. There is no excuse for charging our service men and women and their families hundreds of times more for generic medications than they could purchase without TRICARE at a local pharmacy. This shouldn’t be how we say ‘thank you for your service and your sacrifices’.”

A Call for Accountability

The ""Audit TRICARE"" campaign is intended to represent more than policy advocacy. PUTT’s goal is to call for the transparency and accountability military families have earned through their service, Ms. Whitney said. PUTT invites healthcare advocates, military families, veterans, and concerned citizens to join this critical conversation.

""Transparency in healthcare pricing isn't a partisan issue—it's an American issue,"" said Brandi Chane, a pharmacy owner based in Weatherford, Texas and PUTT Board member whose mother is on TRICARE for Life. ""When we ensure fair, competitive pricing for military healthcare, we strengthen both our commitment to those who serve and our responsibility to ourselves as taxpayers. It’s the taxpayers who are funding these vital services.”

Together, this collaboration ensures continuity of care for beneficiaries—even during real-world contingencies—while supporting the dual mission of healthcare delivery and operational preparedness.

HLA Hospital Jerez Puerta del Sur has long been a crucial partner with the Navy, serving as a key pillar in the extended healthcare network that benefits service members, their families, and other U.S. beneficiaries stationed in the region. The hospital's state-of-the-art facilities and commitment to excellence in medical care have played a significant role in filling gaps and providing seamless healthcare solutions.

During the visit, discussions centered around the hospital's latest advancements in technology, specialized medical services, and infrastructure developments. Both teams emphasized the importance of sharing knowledge and collaborating on best practices to ensure the highest quality care for patients. This partnership reflects a dedication to fostering a healthcare environment that is proactive, inclusive, and responsive to the needs of the community.

Dr. Antonio Amaya, chief executive officer of HLA Hospital Jerez Puerta del Sur, expressed his gratitude for the collaboration, noting that such partnerships are instrumental in achieving healthcare goals that transcend institutional boundaries. ""Our shared vision of patient-centric care strengthens the bond between our organizations, and we remain committed to delivering excellence together,"" said Amaya.

USNH Rota leadership echoed that sentiment, emphasizing the vital role HLA Hospital Jerez Puerta del Sur plays in maintaining continuity of care and reinforcing a trusted network of support. Hospital Director, and NMRTC Commanding Officer Capt. Michael Mercado highlighted the importance of this enduring alliance, “Collaborations with trusted partners like HLA Hospital Jerez Puerta del Sur are vital to maintaining operational readiness and ensuring our warfighters and their families receive the highest level of care. We value the shared dedication to excellence and the continued strength of this relationship.”

This engagement marks another step forward in optimizing healthcare delivery and sustaining a resilient, responsive network for U.S. beneficiaries abroad. Both institutions remain committed to innovation, excellence, and a shared mission of delivering world-class medical care. At the same time, NMRTC Rota remains focused on maintaining an operational medical force capable of supporting missions wherever and whenever needed.

NMRTC Rota serves as a force multiplier in Navy Medicine’s strategic global medical support mission throughout Europe, Africa, and the Middle East while also supporting operational readiness and maintaining a strategic repository of expertise at the Naval Hospital Rota Military Training Facility within the Iberian Peninsula.

The Naval Dosimetry Center (NDC), located at Walter Reed National Military Medical Center in Bethesda, Maryland, serves as the U.S. Navy’s premier facility for radiation exposure monitoring, dosimetry processing, and radiological consultation.
As a critical enabler of force health protection and mission assurance, the NDC plays a vital role in sustaining a medically ready force and a ready medical force.","BETHESDA, Md. (June 11, 2025) – The Naval Dosimetry Center (NDC) marked a major milestone in its enduring mission to protect the health and operational readiness of Sailors and Marines with the official opening of its new, state-of-the-art facility at Walter Reed National Military Medical Center on June 11, 2025.

The ribbon-cutting ceremony, attended by senior Navy leaders, commemorated the completion of a multi-year transition to modernize NDC’s capabilities and reinforce its strategic role in supporting Fleet and force health protection.

The newly constructed facility provides a permanent, purpose-built home for the Navy’s centralized hub for radiation dosimetry processing, oversight, and consultation. The NDC’s mission spans the full spectrum of naval operations—delivering precision radiation monitoring for commands operating nuclear-powered platforms, supporting medical departments utilizing diagnostic and therapeutic radiation, and maintaining safety for industrial applications like radiographic inspection and nuclear weapons security. With a comprehensive registry of ionizing radiation exposure records dating back to 1947—now covering over 600,000 individuals—the center plays a foundational role in protecting the long-term health of Navy and Marine Corps personnel.

“This new facility is a testament to the relentless hard work and dedication of the entire NDC team,” said Cmdr. Jeff Delzer, Officer in Charge of the Naval Dosimetry Center. “We are the stewards of radiation safety across the Fleet, and this modernized center ensures we can continue that mission with the highest level of accuracy, efficiency, and accountability. It represents not just a new building, but a renewed commitment to our operational partners and the warfighters we serve.”

The facility was constructed to meet the stringent performance and environmental control standards required by the National Voluntary Laboratory Accreditation Program (NVLAP), which provides internationally recognized accreditation for the precision and reliability of dosimetry measurements.

“Maintaining NVLAP accreditation is fundamental to everything we do,” said Lt. Cmdr. Jessica Saunders, Science and Research Officer. “It guarantees to the Fleet and our joint partners that our results are accurate, legally defensible, and mission ready. This facility was engineered from the ground up to support quality, safety, and scientific excellence—hallmarks of Navy Medicine’s operational commitment.”

The center’s seamless transition into the new space was made possible through careful coordination with Defense Health Agency planners and key contract partners.

“Mission continuity was non-negotiable,” said Master Chief Hospital Corpsman Casey Potvin, Senior Enlisted Leader. “We executed each phase of this relocation with precision to ensure no interruption in support to the Fleet. Every service member relying on our monitoring continued to receive uninterrupted coverage—a direct result of our team’s professionalism and foresight.”

With roots tracing back to 1947 and centralized processing established in 1968 at Naval Hospital Bethesda, the Naval Dosimetry Center has long been a quiet but critical enabler of Fleet safety and survivability. The current relocation was driven by requirements under the 2005 Base Realignment and Closure legislation and the Walter Reed Medical Center Addition/Alteration project. While temporarily operating from an interim facility during construction, the NDC continued delivering uninterrupted support to operational forces, setting the stage for this long-awaited milestone.

Now fully operational in its new home, the Naval Dosimetry Center is better positioned than ever to uphold its legacy of excellence and ensure the radiation readiness and safety of the U.S. Navy and Marine Corps for generations to come.

The Naval Dosimetry Center (NDC), located at Walter Reed National Military Medical Center in Bethesda, Maryland, serves as the U.S. Navy’s premier facility for radiation exposure monitoring, dosimetry processing, and radiological consultation.

To receive an emergency refill of prescription medications, TRICARE beneficiaries should take their prescription bottle to any TRICARE retail network pharmacy.

To find a network pharmacy, beneficiaries may call Express Scripts at 1-877-363-1303, or search the network pharmacy locator.

If possible, visit the pharmacy where the prescription was filled. Prescriptions filled by a retail chain may be filled at another store in that chain. If the clinician who prescribed the medication is available, beneficiaries can ask them to call in a new prescription to any network pharmacy.

As a reminder, TRICARE beneficiaries, other than active duty service members, may receive urgent care from any TRICARE-authorized urgent care center or provider and do not need a referral. This allows beneficiaries to seek nonemergency care for illnesses or injuries if their primary care provider is unavailable because of emergencies. Any TRICARE beneficiary who reasonably believes they have an emergency should always call 911 or, go to the nearest emergency room.
