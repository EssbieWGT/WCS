Call Tricare and ask for claims and then ask to speak with a supervisor in claims. Always get a call reference number and keep notes on what day and time you called.

I would send a letter to your congressman- they take veteran care seriously and usually will act on the situation if they start to have complaints- there was a survey that someone posted in reference to the issue also to collect information- if someone has that could they repost the link to it?",,N,-1.0,2025-03-30 14:56:14.826864

Further details can be found at https://sayarc.com/tricare-approved-iop/

According to the Department of Veterans Affairs, substance abuse is a growing issue in the armed forces, with nearly 10% of veterans reporting substance use problems in the past year. This statistic underscores the increasing need for specialized programs tailored to the unique challenges faced by military personnel, and the IOP at the Addiction Resource Center provides a structured treatment option.

The center explains that IOPs are especially suitable for active duty service members who require more support than traditional outpatient therapy but do not need inpatient rehabilitation. This program focuses on helping individuals manage their substance use challenges while fulfilling their responsibilities at home, work, or within their military units.

The IOP's structure includes evidence-based treatment methods, such as group and individual therapy, designed to address the root causes of addiction. The program’s flexibility accommodates the unpredictable schedules of active duty members, with evening and weekend sessions to ensure that military duties can be prioritized alongside recovery.

The Addiction Resource Center’s clinicians are trained to address the unique stressors that military personnel face, such as deployment, PTSD, and reintegration into civilian life. Each treatment plan is personalized to meet the individual needs of the participant, ensuring that they receive care that is both effective and culturally sensitive. Tricare insurance coverage ensures that the program remains affordable, significantly reducing out-of-pocket costs for service members

In addition to individual and group therapy, the program includes family therapy and support to help loved ones navigate the recovery process. The Addiction Resource Center emphasizes the importance of providing a confidential, judgment-free environment to support the long-term recovery of military personnel.

About ARC

The Addiction Resource Center, with over 50 years of combined experience in evidence-based care, is committed to serving those who serve the country.

SOURCE Faruqi & Faruqi, LLP","(MENAFN- PR Newswire) Faruqi & Faruqi is a leading national securities law firm with offices in New York, Pennsylvania, California and Georgia. The firm has recovered hundreds of millions of dollars for investors since its founding in 1995. See .

As detailed below, the complaint alleges that the Company and its executives violated federal securities laws by making false and/or misleading statements and/or failing to disclose: (1) that Zynex shipped products, including electrodes, in excess of need; (2) that, as a result of this practice, the Company inflated its revenue; (3) that the Company's practice of filing false claims drew scrutiny from insurers, including Tricare; (4) that, as a result, it was reasonably likely that Zynex would face adverse consequences, including removal from insurer networks and penalties from the federal government; and (5) that, as a result of the foregoing, Defendants' positive statements about the Company's business, operations, and prospects were materially misleading and/or lacked a reasonable basis.

On June 4, 2024, medical journal STAT published a report on Zynex entitled ""How a device maker inundated pain patients with unwanted batteries and surprise bills."" The report claimed Zynex engaged in an ""oversupplying scheme"" by sending inordinate amounts of monthly supplies like electrode pads and batteries in order to ""bill insurers for thousands of dollars more than it otherwise could."" The report further revealed that, as a result of this practice, insurers were ""kicking the company out of network.""

On this news, Zynex's stock price fell $0.50 per share, or 5%, to close at $9.35 per share on June 4, 2024, on unusually heavy trading volume.

On March 11, 2025, after the market closed, Zynex reported its fourth quarter and full year 2024 financial results, revealing a significant revenue ""shortfall"" in the quarter ""due to slower than normal payments from certain payers."" Zynex further revealed ""Tricare has temporarily suspended payments as they review prior claims."" Tricare is the health insurance program for the U.S. military.

On this news, Zynex's stock price fell $3.59 per share, or 51.3%, to close at $3.41 per share on March 12, 2025, on unusually heavy trading volume.

The court-appointed lead plaintiff is the investor with the largest financial interest in the relief sought by the class who is adequate and typical of class members who directs and oversees the litigation on behalf of the putative class. Any member of the putative class may move the Court to serve as lead plaintiff through counsel of their choice, or may choose to do nothing and remain an absent class member. Your ability to share in any recovery is not affected by the decision to serve as a lead plaintiff or not.

Senator Murray has repeatedly voiced serious concerns over staffing shortages and decline in services at Naval Hospital Bremerton, spoke with Naval leadership about the issue last May on a visit to Puget Sound Naval Shipyard — PHOTOS HERE

Washington, D.C. — Today, U.S. Senator Patty Murray (D-WA), Vice Chair of the Senate Appropriations Committee, sent a letter to the Acting Director of the Defense Health Agency (DHA), Dr. David Smith, expressing serious concerns over chronic staffing shortages at Naval Hospital Bremerton (NHB), which have forced the hospital to send hundreds of patients off base for medical care. In the letter, Murray outlined her alarm over the pattern of declining care and personnel mismanagement at one of the nation’s largest Naval bases and pressed Acting Director Smith for answers to questions including how the Military Health System and Defense Health Network plan to fill the vacancies in NHB’s Internal Medicine department.

“Naval Base Kitsap Bremerton is the third-largest Naval base in the country with 15,000 service personnel and 18,000 family members and retirees. Ensuring access to medical care for its servicemembers, retirees, and their families is crucial to maintaining military readiness. Yet NHB continues to experience staffing shortages, and no plan has been outlined to address them,” Murray wrote in the letter sent March 26th.

“In February, NHB spokesperson Doug Stutz confirmed that, since late November, the hospital’s internal medicine clinic has been staffed by only one physician for 2,200 patients. As a result, 700 retired military personnel and veterans have been transferred to facilities across Kitsap County. The reassignment of patients to new providers presents significant challenges, including disruptions in continuity of care which has led to gaps in treatment and potential declines in patient outcomes. It is also causing logistical and transportation barriers, particularly for older veterans or those with mobility limitations and difficulties in specialized care coordination, especially in designated Health Professional Shortage Areas (HPSAs). These concerns must be addressed immediately,” Murray continued.

“The fact that DHA has struggled to resolve this issue with NHB within established military staffing systems raises serious concerns about whether DHA can address it in a timely manner. Furthermore, physician shortages have been an ongoing issue for the Kitsap County community, exacerbating NHB’s difficulties in recruiting and retaining medical personnel. Unfortunately, this downsize is part of a continuous trend in the declining quality of care at NHB,” Senator Murray wrote. “This pattern of declining care and personnel mismanagement at one of the largest Naval bases in the nation suggests a lack of attention to the healthcare needs of servicemembers, veterans, and their families in Kitsap County.”

Murray concluded by requesting a briefing from DHA detailing its plan to resolve long-term staffing shortages at NHB and prevent similar issues at other military medical facilities, and for answers to the following questions:

When will the Military Health System and Defense Health Network fill the vacancies in NHB’s Internal Medicine department?

What long-term policies and procedures are being implemented to improve NHB’s trajectory and ensure better quality of care for servicemembers, veterans, and their families?

How does DHA prioritize staffing of medical professionals based on base size and installation locations in high-risk and health shortage areas?

In a Senate Appropriations Defense subcommittee hearing last year, Senator Murray raised this issue with former Navy Secretary Carlos Del Toro, pressing him on the Navy’s efforts to ensure adequate health care services are available at NHB as the facility faces a provider shortage combined with an increase in service members seeking care. And in a visit to Puget Sound Naval Shipyard last May, Murray spoke with Naval leadership about the reduction of services at NHB. Murray also sent a letter with former U.S. Representative Derek Kilmer raising concerns about the closure of the Labor and Delivery Department at NHB, among other issues, in October 2023.

For overseas maternity care: If you have TRICARE Prime Overseas, you’ll get care at military hospitals and clinics when available.
If you have TRICARE Prime Remote Overseas, you should contact the TRICARE Overseas contractor, International SOS, for assistance.
A: You must have TRICARE Prime, TRICARE Prime Remote, or TRICARE Select.
You have 90 days from the date of DEERS registration to change your child’s enrollment to TRICARE Prime Overseas or TRICARE Prime Remote Overseas (if available and command-sponsored).","Are you expecting a baby in 2025? TRICARE covers many services to help you through pregnancy, childbirth, and after your baby is born. Prenatal and postpartum care helps keep both you and your baby healthy by catching any problems early—and, recent updates to the Childbirth and Breastfeeding Support Demonstration now bring more support options to families worldwide.

“These expanded services help military families get the support they need during a critical time in their lives,” said Jennifer Stankovic, health systems specialist, TRICARE Health Plan, at the Defense Health Agency. “Our goal is to make sure military families have access to quality maternity support no matter where they live around the world.”

Coverage for maternity care and childbirth

As detailed in the TRICARE Maternity Care Brochure, TRICARE covers:

Obstetric visits during pregnancy

Ultrasounds

Prenatal and postpartum physical therapy and pelvic floor therapy

Prenatal carrier screening

Management of high-risk pregnancies

Hospital care during and after birth

Deliveries at TRICARE-certified and authorized birthing centers or deliveries planned at home (in the U.S.)

Breastfeeding support and breast pumps

Anesthesia for pain management during labor and delivery

Caesarean sections

Your costs depend on your TRICARE plan. Active duty service members and their family members with TRICARE Prime have no costs for maternity services.

How to get maternity care

Your path to maternity care depends on which TRICARE plan you have.

If you have TRICARE Prime:

Start by calling your primary care manager. Your PCM will help coordinate all your maternity care.

Does your military hospital or clinic have maternity services? If so, you’ll continue to receive care there.

If maternity care isn't available at your military hospital or clinic, your PCM will refer you to a civilian provider.

You don’t have copayments or cost-shares for covered services.

If you have TRICARE Prime Remote:

Your assigned PCM will direct your care.

You can see any TRICARE-authorized civilian provider with pre-approval from your regional contractor. Your PCM will help you with the pre-approval process.

If you have TRICARE Select:

You can see any TRICARE-approved provider without a referral.

If you see a network provider, you’ll pay less out-of-pocket, and they'll file claims for you.

Non-network providers might charge more, and you may need to file your own claims.

If you have TRICARE Young Adult:

You follow the same rules as the plan you chose—either TYA Prime or TYA Select.

With TYA Prime, you'll work with your assigned PCM for referrals.

With TYA Select, you can see any TRICARE-approved provider without a referral.

Remember: If you have a baby while on TYA, your child isn’t automatically covered by TRICARE unless the child's other parent is a military sponsor.

For overseas maternity care:

If you have TRICARE Prime Overseas, you’ll get care at military hospitals and clinics when available. Otherwise, your PCM will refer you to a civilian provider.

If you have TRICARE Prime Remote Overseas, you should contact the TRICARE Overseas contractor, International SOS, for assistance.

If you have TRICARE Select Overseas, you can see almost any TRICARE-authorized provider. You may need to pay upfront and file for reimbursement.

Dental care during your pregnancy

The TRICARE Dental Program provides a third cleaning in a 12-month period during pregnancy. To use this benefit, let your dental provider know that you're pregnant when scheduling your appointment.

Childbirth and Breastfeeding Support Demonstration updates

The Childbirth and Breastfeeding Support Demonstration gives you access to additional pregnancy and postnatal support. This program helps military families by covering services from specialized providers whose services aren’t otherwise covered by TRICARE.

Here are some answers to frequently asked questions about the CBSD.

Q: Can I use the CBSD?

A:

You must have TRICARE Prime, TRICARE Prime Remote, or TRICARE Select. (Note: You aren’t eligible if you have TRICARE For Life, the US Family Health Plan, or the Continued Health Care Benefit Program.)

You need to be at least 20 weeks pregnant for childbirth support or 27 weeks for breastfeeding support.

You must plan to give birth outside a military hospital or clinic.

Q: How has CBSD coverage changed in the U.S.?

A:

Doulas must now sign a participation agreement.

You now get a total of six hours of doula support (before or after birth) that can be divided by 15-minute increments, plus unlimited support during birth.

Doulas can’t charge you for covered services after you meet your deductible. They also can’t ask you to file your own claims.

Q: The CBSD expanded overseas Jan. 1. How do I access CBSD services overseas?

A: You can register for CBSD services with International SOS at any point in pregnancy, before getting any services. They'll try to find a provider within 14 days. You can start receiving care at 20 weeks of pregnancy.

The CBSD covers certified labor doulas who support you during pregnancy, birth, and postpartum, as well as lactation consultants and counselors who help with breastfeeding.

It’s important to know that TRICARE can’t guarantee CBSD services overseas. International SOS will try to find a provider for every eligible and interested beneficiary, but it may not always be possible.

Do you think you may move during your pregnancy? Contact your regional contractor to keep your care on track.

This demonstration runs through Dec. 31, 2026.

Coverage for your baby

Your baby gets their own TRICARE coverage after birth. But you need to take action to ensure continuous coverage:

Register your baby in the Defense Enrollment Eligibility Reporting System within 90 days in the U.S. or 120 days overseas.

To register in DEERS, the sponsor must go to a Uniformed Services ID card office. Bring your baby's official birth certificate or FS-240 Consular Report of Birth Abroad.

If you miss the registration deadline, your baby will only be able to use military pharmacy services and get care at military hospitals and clinics if space is available.

After registering in DEERS, coverage works differently based on sponsor status:

Children of ADSMs are automatically enrolled in TRICARE Prime (if they live in a Prime Service Area in the U.S.) or TRICARE Select. Overseas, children are enrolled to TRICARE Select Overseas. You have 90 days from the date of DEERS registration to change your child’s enrollment to TRICARE Prime Overseas or TRICARE Prime Remote Overseas (if available and command-sponsored). You can change your child's plan within 90 days of DEERS registration.

Children of retirees aren’t automatically enrolled. You must submit enrollment forms to your regional contractor.

Children of TRICARE Reserve Select or TRICARE Retired Reserve enrollees aren’t automatically enrolled. You must submit enrollment forms to your regional contractor.

To check your child’s enrollment, visit milConnect within 90 days of birth.

Childbirth is also a Qualifying Life Event. This means you have 90 days to switch your family’s TRICARE health plan, if you want to make a change. All family members are eligible to change their health plan after a QLE.

The agency announced Thursday that patients now have until April 30 to update their payment information with TriWest, get specialty care without prior authorization from the company, and receive care from non-network providers authorized by Tricare under the extension.

The postponement marks the fourth time patients have received a reprieve to update their payment information if they pay TriWest by bank draft or credit card. The original deadline was Dec. 31; it had been extended through Jan. 30 and subsequently Feb. 28 and March 31.

The deadline to receive specialty care without prior approval from TriWest -- a requirement for patients who use the Tricare Prime program -- also has been extended from March 31 until April 30. The waiver was initiated in late January due to problems with TriWest's referral portal that affected processing, according to Jacob Sanchez, referral management subject-matter expert for Tricare at the DHA.

And an original March 31 deadline regarding ""point of service"" care, or services provided by Tricare-authorized health providers who aren't in TriWest's network, also has been extended to April 30, according to DHA officials.

TriWest was awarded a 9-year, $65 billion contract to manage health care for 4.5 million beneficiaries in Tricare's West Region in December 2022; after a series of bid protests, it became effective in January.

Even before the contract began Jan. 1, however, patients and providers had concerns over the transition from former contractor Health Net Federal Services, with some providers saying they weren't aware of the change and patients worried that they would be required to switch physicians.

A Tricare West Region patient who requested anonymity to protect her health information said her primary care provider wasn't aware of any changes to the Tricare contract until just last week -- nearly four months into the transition -- and didn't know she had to apply to become part of TriWest's network.

""I still have no idea who I'm supposed to see,"" the patient said in an email to Military.com. ""I would prefer to stay with my current provider.""

For now, the Tricare patient will be able to see that provider until April 30. The point-of-service waiver allows patients to continue seeing doctors who were in Health Net's network who aren't yet enrolled with TriWest or will not become part of the new network.

According to the DHA, patients seeking care under the point-of-service waiver will still pay copayments, and they should ask any non-network providers whether they are authorized by Tricare.

""This means they're licensed by a state, accredited by a national organization, or meet other standards of the medical community [and] certified to provide benefits under Tricare,"" officials wrote in a statement.

Under the extension for specialty care, Tricare Prime beneficiaries still will need to see their primary care physicians for a referral but will not have to get authorization from TriWest to get care.

According to Tricare, they must have a copy of a referral from their primary care provider dated between Jan. 1 and April 30, as well as a copy of the waiver approval letter, which is available on the Tricare website.

The waiver for specialty care authorization does not apply to inpatient care, autism services, laboratory developed tests, and services under the Extended Care Health Option, a program that provides support for beneficiaries with special needs.

Patients enrolled in a Tricare premium-based plan, including Tricare Young Adult, Tricare Reserve Select and Tricare Retired Reserve also were given until April 30 to update their payment information with TriWest, according to Thursday's announcement.

Tricare officials said that if beneficiaries don't update their payment information or any fees before April 30, they will be disenrolled, retroactive to Jan. 1.

None of the enrollment requirements applies to Tricare for Life, the program for beneficiaries eligible for Medicare.

More information is available on the Tricare West Region website.

DOD’s acquisition and sustainment communities are primarily responsible for ensuring warfighters have the tools to fight and win in any conflict.
Michael said he’d work to rebuild the department’s relationship with the defense technology sector if confirmed.
“The military health system is a global leader in delivering world-class care, unmatched in excellence and second to none,” he said.
“A strong military health system is the cornerstone of our National Defense Strategy, and maintaining a medically ready force requires [an] integrated, innovative and adaptive health care system.” By C. Todd Lopez, DOD News","MARCH 28, 2025 – More efficient and faster acquisition, better technology and military hardware, and better medical care to keep service members healthy were among the commitments made on Capitol Hill by three Defense Department nominees.

Lawmakers from the Senate Armed Services Committee heard testimony from Michael P. Duffey, nominated for undersecretary of defense for acquisition and sustainment; Emil G. Michael, nominated for undersecretary of defense for research and engineering; and Keith M. Bass, nominated for assistant secretary of defense for health affairs.

“If confirmed, I would assume responsibility to implement President [Donald J.] Trump’s mandate and [Defense] Secretary [Pete] Hegseth’s priorities by providing the military with the capabilities and force structure necessary to deter our adversaries and, if necessary, prevail in conflict,” Duffey said.

DOD’s acquisition and sustainment communities are primarily responsible for ensuring warfighters have the tools to fight and win in any conflict. Duffey said he would change how the department operates to achieve that goal.

“This will require the department to modernize how it manages the integration of requirements, budgeting and acquisition processes, aligning incentives to deliver results,” he said. “We must deepen our understanding of the strengths and vulnerabilities within our defense industrial base and seek to revitalize through reindustrialization, increased investment, flexible contracting, enhanced workforce recruitment and training and increased competition.”

If confirmed, Duffey told senators he’d focus on four priorities:

Accelerating the delivery of tools to warfighters.

Increasing the speed, performance and affordability of acquisition systems.

Strengthening the defense industrial base.

Bringing modern business systems and management practices to DOD.

Michael told senators that China is a strong competitor, and the U.S. must adapt to remain stronger.

“Time must be a factor in all of our decisions as we confront an increasingly sophisticated adversary in China, which not only has lower labor costs but is notorious for intellectual property theft, making its research and development costs even faster and less expensive than we could have imagined only a decade ago,” he said.

Michael said he’d work to rebuild the department’s relationship with the defense technology sector if confirmed.

“The DOD needs to foster a more robust and competitive defense industrial base by providing more realistic requirements, inviting [in] smaller and innovative companies with less burdensome processes, [and] becoming more agile in how and when we grant contracts,” he said.

It’s not the first time Michael has worked for the Defense Department. He told lawmakers he worked for then-Defense Secretary Robert Gates and played a role in developing the mine-resistant, ambush-protected vehicle and Joint Improvised Explosive Device Defeat Organization.

“If confirmed, I’d bring my decades of experience in the technology industry and management of large, complex, global organizations to ensure that the United States has the most technologically sophisticated defense systems in history,” he said.

If confirmed, Bass would be responsible for executing DOD’s medical mission and providing and maintaining readiness for medical services and support to service members.

“The military health system is a global leader in delivering world-class care, unmatched in excellence and second to none,” he said. “I’m excited about the future of military medicine and the opportunity to drive innovation and improve patient outcomes. By continuing to focus on modernization, technology, research, [and] care delivery, we can strengthen our operational readiness and set new standards.”

Bass said pressing issues in the military health care system include ensuring the readiness of American forces, recruiting and retaining medical personnel, and adapting to rapid technological advances.

“If confirmed, my highest priority will be ensuring the medical readiness of our forces [and] stabilizing the military health system to provide [the most] advanced care possible both on and off the battlefield,” he said. “A strong military health system is the cornerstone of our National Defense Strategy, and maintaining a medically ready force requires [an] integrated, innovative and adaptive health care system.”

The award recognizes entire departments for their safety practices and was presented to the ED for its proactive patient safety event reporting efforts from March 2024 to February 2025.

“A high-reliability culture requires staff at every level to feel comfortable sharing information and concerns with others, and they should be recognized when they do,” said Chief Medical Officer, Cmdr. Andrew McDermott.

Individual staff members were recognized with a “Good Catch!” award, which highlights safety events or potential problems identified and reported before they could cause harm to a patient.
