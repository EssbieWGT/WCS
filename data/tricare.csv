His top nutritional lifestyle suggestion is the long-popular and varied Mediterranean diet. The diet includes a variety of fruits, vegetables, whole grains, potatoes, beans, nuts, and seeds; olive oil as a primary fat source; and dairy products, eggs, fish, and poultry in low to moderate amounts.

Work in the private sector is generally more volatile and it is incredible to not be dependent on your employer for healthcare and never having to change plans.

My buddy gets $14,000/yr bonus for using Tricare.

I went reserves when I left AD for grad school, partially for this reason. I would say it's worth it in some contexts, if your civilian job doesn't have very good insurance and you don't mind having a part-time job cutting into your free time, but take a really good look at what's available from your employer.

(NASDAQ: ZYXI) securities between March 13, 2023 to March 11, 2025. Zynex is a medical device manufacturer that produces and markets electrotherapy devices for use in pain management and physical rehabilitation.

The Allegations: Robbins LLP is Investigating Allegations that Zynex, Inc. (ZYXI) Inflated its Revenue and Filed False Claims

According to the complaint, during the class period, defendants failed to disclose to investors: (1) that Zynex shipped products, including electrodes, in excess of need; (2) that, as a result of this practice, the Company inflated its revenue; (3) that the Company's practice of filing false claims drew scrutiny from insurers, including Tricare; and (4) that, as a result, it was reasonably likely that Zynex would face adverse consequences, including removal from insurer networks and penalties from the federal government.

On March 11, 2025, Zynex reported its fourth quarter and full year 2024 financial results, revealing a significant revenue ""shortfall"" in the quarter ""due to slower than normal payments from certain payers."" Zynex further revealed ""Tricare has temporarily suspended payments as they review prior claims."" Tricare is the health insurance program for the U.S. military. On this news, Zynex's stock price fell $3.59 per share, or 51.3%, to close at $3.41 per share on March 12, 2025.

What Now: You may be eligible to participate in the class action against Zynex, Inc. Shareholders who want to serve as lead plaintiff for the class must file their papers with the court by May 19, 2025. A lead plaintiff is a representative party who acts on behalf of other class members in directing the litigation. You do not have to participate in the case to be eligible for a recovery.

Review Your New Employer’s Health Plan If you’ve landed a new civilian job, review the health insurance benefits they offer.
Most employers provide a health plan that will serve as your primary coverage, like the TRICARE coverage you had while serving.
Some employers have a High Deductible Health Plan (HDHP), which can be part of a PPO or HMO.
Health care through the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) may be an option.","Tackling life after the military comes with its challenges, and one of the biggest decisions separating Service members face is figuring out health insurance. Whether you’re heading into a new job, enrolling in a different healthcare plan, or planning to retire, it’s important to know what options are available for you and your family. While most military retirees can continue using TRICARE, let’s go over what’s out there, especially if you’re separating or transitioning to civilian healthcare.

Review Your New Employer’s Health Plan

If you’ve landed a new civilian job, review the health insurance benefits they offer. Most employers provide a health plan that will serve as your primary coverage, like the TRICARE coverage you had while serving. You’ll likely need to sign up for your new employer’s plan as part of the onboarding process. Health insurance plans come in many shapes and sizes, but two of the most common types you’ll encounter are Health Maintenance Organizations (HMO) and Preferred Provider Organizations (PPO).

HMOs usually require you to choose a primary care physician (PCP), who then refers you to specialists if needed. These plans are cost-effective, but they do come with some restrictions, like only being able to see in-network doctors.

PPOs, on the other hand, are more flexible. You can see any specialist or doctor without needing a referral, and while in-network care is cheaper, you can still go outside the network for a higher cost. PPOs tend to have higher premiums but offer more freedom when it comes to choosing providers.

Some employers have a High Deductible Health Plan (HDHP), which can be part of a PPO or HMO. These plans have higher deductibles but lower premiums, making them potentially more affordable to healthy participants. HDHPs are often paired with a Health Savings Account (HSA), which allows you to save money tax-free for medical expenses. If you are generally healthy and expect to need minimal coverage, a HDHP with an HSA could be a good way to manage your healthcare costs and save for future medical expenses.

Explore Other Coverage Options

If you’re a military retiree, you’re eligible to keep using TRICARE for your healthcare, with additional costs. This could include annual enrollment fees, deductibles, copays, and premiums, depending on the plan you select.

If you’re transitioning out of service and aren’t retiring, there are still a few options available:

The Continued Health Care Benefit Program (CHCBP) offers temporary civilian health coverage if you lose eligibility for TRICARE, but you’ll need to sign up for this within 60 days of losing coverage.

The Transitional Assistance Management Program (TAMP) provides 180 days of coverage for certain service members transitioning from active duty.

Health care through the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) may be an option. The VA generally covers veterans only, so it is important to know how to obtain coverage for your family members. However, if a veteran is rated permanently and totally disabled or died from a service-connected disability, their spouse and dependent children may qualify for coverage under the Civilian Health and Medical Program of the Department of Veterans Affairs (CHAMPVA).

If you don’t qualify for any of these programs, you can check out the Affordable Care Act (ACA) marketplace for health plans.

Don’t Forget Your Health Records

Finally, before you separate or retire, make sure you gather all your health records, including those for your family members. Having a complete copy of your medical history, including prescriptions, will make it easier to transition to new care providers regardless of which health insurance plan you choose. If you have ongoing medical needs, this is especially important for making sure your new provider has all the necessary information. Receiving these records can take a while, so jump on this request sooner rather than later.",https://usaaef.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/USAAEF_March31_Blog.png,N,0.0,2025-03-31 23:56:23.001675

Military health insurance in Illinois is provided by a federal military insurance provider called TriWest. It's part of a national program known as TriCare. Many medical providers who accept the insurance say their bills haven't been paid since Jan. 1, when the program underwent restructuring. TriWest previously claimed its payment delays would be resolved by the end of March.

NBC 5 Responds started investigating payment delays in February. After our report, one medical clinic in Lake Forest was able to get tens of thousands of dollars in claims paid by TriWest. Yet providers nationwide told NBC 5 Responds they are still waiting for the insurance provider to release payment to them.

Staff at 360° Wellness & Coaching in Lake Forest, which provides mental health treatment to active-duty military, veterans and their families, say they currently have 243 unpaid claims with TriWest. They say there's been no transparency or structured plan presented to resolve the balance.

While 360° Wellness & Coaching will continue offering services for the time being, other clinics are beginning to ask for payment up front or refusing to take TriWest all together.

On TikTok, a woman with PTSD told NBC 5 Responds: ""My therapist who I see for PTSD has not been paid … since December. I am currently paying full price for my sessions so she can keep seeing me, pay her own bills and not go out of business.""

Another woman with a chronic illness shared: ""Every appointment has thousands in lab work. I need new referrals, but TriCare isn't paying doctors or approving referrals. ... I can't risk thous $$$.""

Sophia Slain, clinical director of 360° Wellness & Coaching, said TriWest also added hurdles for patients and providers when it comes to getting insurance authorizations for new or continuing treatment.

In the past, getting treatment authorized meant Slain could see a patient for up to 24 sessions. Now, Slain said, the length and frequency of treatment must be approved much more frequently, creating delays and red tape for patients who need services.

""More than half of our patients need new authorizations by March 31st,"" said Slain, who adds her clinic was told patients would need reauthorization just last week. ""In order to get those authorizations, they have to do three different touch points over at the federal hospital. ... And then in addition, we need to write up a blurb explaining the medical necessity for them getting that additional authorization.""

Slain also said TriWest hasn't explained the new changes to patients either.

""If it's taking this much time to get those authorizations and people aren't being informed about the authorizations, and now they're giving you a ridiculous deadline that's essentially a week out, that's a real issue. These people need their services. They need those services to go off smoothly,"" said Slain.

In a statement, TriWest told us it expedited the review and payment of claims from 360° Wellness and Coaching after NBC 5 Responds brought the ""provider's claim issues to [their] attention.""

TriWest also said that it's processed more than 25,000 clams in Illinois and 3.5 million claims nationwide since January. It did not answer questions about how many outstanding claims remain in Illinois.

TriWest said it is processing more than 91 percent of claims within 30 days and that it continues ""to work toward reaching our target of 98% within 30 days or less.""",https://media.nbcchicago.com/2019/09/060809-military-generic-p1-1-1.jpg?quality=85&strip=all&resize=1200%2C675,N,-1.0,2025-03-31 22:56:18.356107

A contract change that brought in TriWest to handle enrollees within the area has brought about confusion, delays, and plenty of frustration among the military community. Hopefully, this extension will help those still not set up get everything in line, but if recent history is any indication, keep an eye out for updates.

TRICARE Deadline Extended for TriWest Enrollees Throughout April

The transfer from Health Net Federal Services (HNFS) to TriWest has not been smooth. Yet another TRICARE deadline is being extended as a result to help enrollees get their accounts in order.

There have been multiple extensions, with the original deadline being December 31, 2024. Now, the deadline of March 31, 2025, has been moved to April 30, 2025.

Patients continue to voice frustrations with moving contractors as well as the healthcare they are receiving, with this being the fourth deadline alteration so far.

Healthcare Confusion Continues

By April 30, patients in the TRICARE West Region will need to update their payment information with TriWest.

The deadline for TRICARE Prime patients to receive specialty care, without prior TriWest approval, has also been extended to April 30 due to referral portal issues.

Despite receiving a 9-year, $65 billion contract, TriWest has proven to fumble the beginning of the transfer, as displeasure has been voiced since December 2022 from many of the 4.5 million beneficiaries the company is now responsible for.

Reaching out for clarity has been a problem among enrollees, and even healthcare providers are finding the change difficult.

Reports have come in of primary care providers still being unaware of changes until the end of March, despite being almost four months into the transition.

The result? Patients have been left to apply to join TriWest's network, healthcare professionals are left in a difficult spot, and everyone suffers in confusion.

Beneficiaries in Limbo

Because some healthcare providers were in Health Net’s network but haven’t enrolled with TriWest yet, patients stuck in limbo can use a point-of-service waiver so that they can see their doctor in the meantime.

However, if you do use the point-of-service waiver, copayments are still your responsibility, and it’s advised that anyone using this method asks non-network providers if they have authorization from TRICARE.

According to an official statement, “This means they're licensed by a state, accredited by a national organization, or meet other standards of the medical community (and) certified to provide benefits under TRICARE.""

The TRICARE deadline extension may not require authorization from TriWest for those enrolled in Prime but referrals from primary care physicians are still a requirement.

TRICARE requires a referral dated between January 1 and April 30 and a waiver approval letter, which you can find by clicking the link.

The specialty care waiver excludes inpatient care, autism services, lab-developed tests, and Extended Care Health Option services.

Premium-based plan enrollees, including TRICARE Young Adult, Reserve Select, and Retired Reserve, have until April 30 to update payment info with TriWest or face disenrollment retroactive to January 1. However, these requirements do not apply to TRICARE for Life.

Latest TRICARE Deadline Extension Casts Another Spotlight on Frustrations

The repeated TRICARE deadline extensions may be working to help the military community, but at the end of the day, they’re also highlighting the many blights brought about by the system.

Transferring millions of beneficiaries to TriWest was never going to be an easy task; however, it’s also clear that the military community deserves better.

The lack of communication for families is bad enough, but with newer reports of confusion from providers, it’s curious to see just how far the lack of transparency goes.

Regardless, if you haven’t already taken advantage of the previous efforts, the April 30 TRICARE deadline extension is available. Be sure to act soon so that you don’t lose access to your healthcare coverage.

The counties impacted are Cameron, Hidalgo, Starr, and Willacy.

To receive an emergency refill of prescription medications, TRICARE beneficiaries should take their prescription bottle to any TRICARE retail network pharmacy.

Spectral AI, Inc., a company specializing in AI-based predictive medical diagnostic tools, has released its annual 10-K report, detailing significant financial and operational achievements over the past year. The report highlights the company's improved financial performance, strategic initiatives, and the challenges it faces in the evolving cybersecurity landscape.

Financial Highlights

Research and development revenue: $29.581 million, reflecting an increase from the previous year's $18.056 million, primarily driven by contracts with BARDA and other U.S. governmental authorities.

Gross profit: $13.274 million, showing an improvement from $7.880 million in the prior year, indicating enhanced efficiency in managing cost of revenue.

Operating loss: $(6.582) million, a reduction from the previous year's operating loss of $(12.984) million, suggesting improved operational efficiency and cost management.

Net loss: $(15.315) million, compared to a net loss of $(20.854) million in the previous year, reflecting a decrease in total other expenses and improved gross profit.

Net loss per share of common stock: $(0.85), compared to $(1.48) in the prior year, indicating a reduction in net loss per share due to improved financial performance.

Business Highlights

Cybersecurity Risk Management: The company employs a comprehensive cybersecurity strategy overseen by the Audit Committee and Board, focusing on emerging risks such as phishing, supply chain threats, and geopolitical tensions. A multi-layered defense system and a robust incident response plan are in place to manage potential cybersecurity incidents.

Human Risk Management Program: A comprehensive program is in place to educate employees on cybersecurity threats, including phishing, malware, and data handling, to serve as the first line of defense against cyber threats.

Third-Party Risk Management: The company maintains a program to assess the security controls of third-party service providers, ensuring that their cybersecurity incidents do not impact the company.

Geographical Performance: The company operates in the US and UK, with significant operations in Dallas, Texas, and a presence in the UK. The company also engages with US government agencies for research and development contracts.

New Product Development: The company is focused on developing the DeepView System, an AI-based predictive medical diagnostic tool for burn wounds, with ongoing efforts to expand its capabilities and obtain FDA approval.

Contract with BARDA: The company has a multi-year contract with BARDA valued at up to $150 million, supporting the clinical validation and FDA clearance of the DeepView System. As of December 31, 2024, $22.9 million remains under the initial award.

MTEC Agreement: The company is developing a handheld version of the DeepView System for military use, with a $4.9 million grant from MTEC and an additional $0.5 million from the Defense Health Agency.

Future Outlook: The company plans to continue its focus on research and development of the DeepView System, leveraging contracts with BARDA and MTEC to support its growth and expansion into new markets.

Strategic Initiatives

Business Combination: The company executed a business combination with Legacy Spectral, resulting in a reverse recapitalization. This strategic move was aimed at enhancing the company's market presence and operational capabilities.

Formation of Spectral IP, Inc.: The company formed a new subsidiary, Spectral IP, Inc., to advance artificial intelligence intellectual property with a focus on healthcare, supported by a $1 million investment from an affiliate of its largest shareholder.

Capital Management: The company entered into a Standby Equity Purchase Agreement (SEPA) with Yorkville, allowing the sale of up to $30 million in common stock, and a Common Stock Purchase Agreement with B. Riley for up to $10 million. These agreements are part of the company's strategy to manage liquidity and fund operations.

Equity and Debt Financing: The company completed an equity financing and entered into a long-term debt financing agreement with Avenue Venture Opportunities Fund II, L.P., with an initial draw-down of $8.5 million. Furthermore, the company issued 2,415,900 shares for net proceeds of approximately $3.1 million through at-the-market equity issuances.

Future Outlook: The company plans to continue leveraging its SEPA and B. Riley agreements to support its liquidity needs and operational funding. It also aims to utilize the proceeds from its recent equity and debt financings to further its strategic initiatives, including the development of its DeepView System and expansion into new markets. The company is focused on maintaining its Nasdaq listing to ensure continued access to capital markets.

Challenges and Risks

The company faces significant cybersecurity risks as part of its overall enterprise risk management strategy. Emerging threats include phishing attacks, third-party supply chain risks, and geopolitical tensions that could lead to sabotage, espionage, and cyber-attacks. The company has implemented a comprehensive human risk management program and a multi-layered cybersecurity technology approach to mitigate these risks. Despite these efforts, there is no assurance that security measures will prevent all incidents, which could adversely affect the business.

CyPath® Lung Reimbursed by Medicare and Private Insurance: The unique CPT code for CyPath® Lung was added to the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) 2024 clinical laboratory schedule effective January 1, leading to reimbursement of the test by both Medicare and private insurers.

My hospitals where I have been seeing my doctors all these years now appear as out of network! So now I have to pay the 20 perfect of whatever Tricare paid the hospital for its services! I also am paying Quest diagnostics co-pays! 20 percent of whatever tricare covered! Never in my life o had to pay for quest labs! Specially when the labs are a covered service! All this is due to the debacle of this new contract! I already called thousands of times and they do recognize is due to the way claims are being processed and that they cannot do anything until they fix the issue.

For background, I'm a retired reservist who recently turned age 60 and enrolled in Tricare Select. I live in the US but have family in the Philippines and visit at least once per year, sometimes twice. Later this year I'm planning to visit for over a month, and I'm hoping to have a comprehensive ""executive physical"" done while I'm there, the kind that checks everything.

I've read that St. Luke's BGC offers an ExecuHealth physical, and also that St. Luke's is in Tricare's preferred provider network (PPN).

So my broad question is, is there anyone here with experience using Tricare at St. Luke's for an elective (non-emergency) procedure like that? And if so can you share what your experience was in scheduling it and paying for it using Tricare?

My more narrow questions are:

- How would a physical exam like this be pre-approved by Tricare? I am under Tricare Select, not Tricare Select Overseas, since I would just be visiting.

- How would this be scheduled with St. Luke's? Do I start with them and have them get Tricare's approval, since they are in Tricare's network (PPN). or do I get it pre-approved through my Tricare region contractor? I presently do not have a primary care physician (PCP), and would like to select a doctor at St, Luke's BGC as my PCP. Some info on Tricare's web site seems to indicate that I can just go do it and then get reimbursed, minus my co-pay.

- How does payment work? I have read that I would probably have to pay up front (up to 15k pesos) but that St. Luke's would process the claim for reimbursement for me.

Any insight or partial info would be greatly appreciated!",,N,0.0,2025-03-31 10:56:39.823733

Tricare/Triwest have issues with claims right now. Do not pay anything until they fix it on their end, esp since they also stated that your provider is in network.

Call Tricare and ask for claims and then ask to speak with a supervisor in claims. Always get a call reference number and keep notes on what day and time you called.

I would send a letter to your congressman- they take veteran care seriously and usually will act on the situation if they start to have complaints- there was a survey that someone posted in reference to the issue also to collect information- if someone has that could they repost the link to it?",,N,-1.0,2025-03-30 14:56:14.826864

But after college, I never looked back it.

Now I'm wondering if I needed to still keep status / ID established? Or did all of that effectively ""expire"" when I aged out of TRICARE?
