Mark Loftis, 38, of Cushing, Oklahoma, was the owner of a medical supply company called Back Pain Home Supplies LLC, which did business as EZ Medical Supply. As alleged, Loftis paid illegal kickbacks to marketers in exchange for the referral of Medicare patients, and to marketers and telemedicine companies in exchange for signed doctors’ orders that could be used to support claims to health care benefit programs. The telemedicine providers did not engage in meaningful evaluation of the patients before signing the orders. Loftis allegedly caused Back Pain to bill Medicare, TRICARE and CHAMPVA for DME that was medically unnecessary, obtained through the payment of illegal kickbacks, and not provided as billed. In total, Back Pain submitted about $30 million in false and fraudulent claims, for which the three health care programs paid about $8 million.

Loftis converted the money he received from the Provider Relief Fund (PRF) for his own use and the use of others, pursuant to the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act. PRF funds were appropriated to help healthcare providers financially impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic, as well as to provide care to patients suffering from COVID-19 and compensate providers for the cost of that care. As alleged, Loftis received more than $133,000 in PRF funds and then falsely attested to a series of conditions to retain the funds, including that he would use the funds for health care expenses and to replace revenue lost due to the pandemic. In reality, Loftis used a portion of the funds to further the DME fraud scheme and for a variety of personal expenses.

Loftis is charged with one count of conspiracy to commit health care fraud and wire fraud, one count of conspiracy to defraud the United States and to offer, pay, solicit, and receive kickbacks, and two counts of theft of government property. If convicted, he faces a maximum penalty of 20 years in prison on the health care and wire fraud conspiracy count, five years in prison on the conspiracy and kickback count, and 10 years in prison on each of the theft of government property counts. A federal judge will determine any sentence after considering the U.S. Sentencing Guidelines and other statutory factors.

I’m pregnant, FTM and recently had routine prenatal genetic carrier screening done through my OB’s office (blood was already drawn and sent to the lab). I’m on TRICARE Select.

After the draw, I received a prior authorization denial from TRICARE saying the testing was denied for “failure to establish medical necessity.” However, when I log into my TRICARE portal, the claim is still listed as “in progress” and I have no EOB yet. But I saw an amount for almost $6000!

What’s confusing is that I personally know other patients at the same OB practice, with TRICARE Select, no high-risk pregnancy or family history, who had the same genetic testing done and it was approved and covered, they didn’t have to pay out of pocket.

The lab used for mine was NxGen MDx (through my OB). I’ve been told the OB has to handle prior auth / appeals, not the front desk billing team.

I’m trying to understand:

• Has anyone had TRICARE deny the prior authorization but show the claim as in progress and still end up paying? • Did anyone have this reversed after the OB resubmitted or appealed? • Did you end up with a self-pay cap, write-off, or full insurance payment?

I’m not trying to get out of something I shouldn’t have. I just want to understand why identical patients at the same OB with the same insurance get different outcomes, and what actually happens next in real life.

Any experiences (good or bad) with TRICARE + prenatal genetic testing would really help. Thanks!",,N,0.0,2026-01-09 17:56:37.874632

“We’ve seen a significant nationwide drop in blood donations during December and January,” said Col. Christopher Evans, Army Blood Program director. “Because blood products have a natural expiration date, we can’t stockpile indefinitely to cover this gap. To solve this, the Army Blood Program has designated Fort Leonard Wood as the West winter blood collection hub. We are conducting this targeted drive to aggressively counter the winter slump and ensure our supply chain remains unbroken heading into the new year.""

Blood will flow from 7 a.m. to 6 p.m. daily and all military units on Fort Leonard Wood, government civilian employees and Tricare beneficiaries in the local community are asked to give.

Donated blood helps service members and their families throughout the Department of War have a better chance of winning their battle against illness and injury.

Blood donors must weigh at least 116 pounds, be at least 17 years old and have been feeling well for at least three days before the drive. They must also be well hydrated and have eaten something before donating. Those wanting to donate should know what foreign countries they’ve traveled to in the past 12 months and bring a photo ID with them to verify eligibility.

Fort Leonard Wood Regulation 690-12, Civilian Personnel Leave Administration, encourages government employees to donate blood and grants excused absence for the time necessary to do so as well as recuperate afterwards and travel to and from the donation site. The maximum excused absence can’t exceed four hours, and supervisor coordination is required.

“Having an ample blood supply available for combatant commanders and special operations forces is a must to keep our forces fit to fight,” Evans said. “We’re thankful we can surge resources at Fort Leonard Wood to meet mission requirements effectively, leveraging our trainee and permanent party populations to save lives.""

Maj. Gen. Christopher Beck, Maneuver Support Center of Excellence and Fort Leonard Wood commanding general, said he’s excited to accept this challenge and show everyone the post’s compassion.

“Currently, the Department of War’s blood inventories are below optimal levels and we need to do all we can to replenish those critical supplies,” he said. “At Fort Leonard Wood, we’re committed to supporting the medical needs of our military community and uphold the values of service and sacrifice. The Armed Services Blood Program enables high-quality care for Department of War beneficiaries, ultimately enhancing the readiness and resilience of our forces.”

Evans said failing to collect the required units at the winter drive is not an option.

""If we do not meet these goals, we place an immediate strain on our military treatment facilities and contingency blood supplies globally,” Evans said. “Failure here creates a gap in coverage that could impact wounded warriors downrange.”

While many early cancer detection tests are highly sensitive, their performance in early stage breast cancer lags behind other types of cancer.
""We're measuring and teasing out this unique fingerprint that breast cancer leaves in the presence of the immune system,"" he said.
In a clinical study testing 1,500 patients — 144 of whom had cancer — Onco-ID Breast was able to detect breast cancer in 97 percent of stage I and stage II patients.
It also intends to work with corporate healthcare plans that have shown interest in utilizing innovative screening modalities for early cancer detection, Lozuk said.","NEW YORK – Liquid biopsy firm Syantra has taken another step forward toward commercialization with the launch of a new study it intends to use for clinical implementation of its early breast cancer detection test.

The Onco-ID Breast assay is a multi-target whole-blood mRNA test that is intended for use as a screening tool for women with elevated risk of breast cancer. The University of Calgary spinout announced last month that it is partnering with Vincere Cancer Center on a clinical trial to support clinical implementation and market access for the test.

The multicenter study, led by Weill Cornell Medicine in collaboration with the University of Calgary, will include 2,000 women ages 30 to 75 with an elevated risk of developing breast cancer and will focus particularly on women with dense breasts, which makes detection through mammography difficult. Breast cancer screening for such women is particularly difficult because mammography is ""horribly inefficient"" in dense breast tissue, Syantra CEO Rob Lozuk noted in an interview.

Syantra's Onco-ID platform does not rely on cell-free or circulating tumor DNA like many other liquid biopsy tests, Lozuk said, because cfDNA and ctDNA alone are not sensitive enough for early detection of breast cancer. While many early cancer detection tests are highly sensitive, their performance in early stage breast cancer lags behind other types of cancer.

Syantra, in contrast, is looking at the immune system's response to the presence of cancer, specifically epigenetic shifts that happen early in cancer, in whole blood. The firm's platform measures the regulation of selected biomarkers that are generally associated with the immune system, which allows it ""to look very early into the process"" and detect cancer, Lozuk said.

""We're measuring and teasing out this unique fingerprint that breast cancer leaves in the presence of the immune system,"" he said.

Vershalee Shukla, a radiation oncologist and cofounder of Vincere Cancer Center who is helping with Syantra's multicenter study, noted that breast cancer is hard to detect through liquid biopsy because the tumor doesn't shed much in the blood. While imaging does a ""good job"" of picking up ductal carcinoma in situ, it also has a high rate of false positives, resulting in patients undergoing unnecessary biopsies.

Shukla said she's optimistic Syantra's technology can help reduce those false positives and ensure women who have dense breast tissue are adequately screened.

The firm's technology was first developed in the laboratory of Tina Rinker, a biomedical engineering professor at the University of Calgary and Syantra's cofounder, when the team used its previous cell-based discovery work to inform breast cancer biomarker discovery more than a decade ago. Funding for that project enabled her team to develop the concept that the Onco-ID technology is based on.

Syantra researchers used clinical samples to develop a prototype test, and began international prospective clinical studies in 2018, Rinker said. The team then identified a panel of transcripts specific to the early detection of breast cancer and the development of predictive models informed by machine learning algorithms. These components form the basis of Onco-ID, which uses qPCR to return a result that says whether the patient is recommended for either follow-up imaging or continued routine screening.

The company's test uses off-the-shelf components for everything except the plate, the chemistry, and its software, Lozuk added. The assay can be run by standard laboratory personnel, and Syantra is currently validating its analytic software, Rinker said.

In a clinical study testing 1,500 patients — 144 of whom had cancer — Onco-ID Breast was able to detect breast cancer in 97 percent of stage I and stage II patients.

The company is currently completing that study, which is expected to finish at the end of the first quarter of 2026 and plans to begin early access commercial pilot programs at multiple sites at the start of Q2 targeting women with dense breast tissue, Lozuk said. Syantra plans to publish the results of its clinical study in a peer-reviewed paper early in Q2, he added.

The firm has also submitted a health economic study to a peer-reviewed publication to make the economic argument for its test and the benefits, he said, adding the company is working to roll out a clinical utility study early this year.

Rinker noted that the company plans to continue running studies on other indicated at-risk populations to strengthen its validation and secure additional reimbursement. It also intends to work with corporate healthcare plans that have shown interest in utilizing innovative screening modalities for early cancer detection, Lozuk said.

The firm's goal is not to commercialize the test itself, but to work with commercial partners to ""take it to the masses,"" he added. While it will make ""nominal"" commercialization efforts in Canada, throughout the rest of the world Syantra intends to use existing companies' infrastructure to ensure access to the test.

Three primary models will be used for commercialization, Lozuk said. One will be test send-out agreements with certain laboratories where Syantra will perform the assay as a laboratory-developed test in its CLIA-certified lab, another approach will involve licensing the technology to other large players in the diagnostic industry, and the final model will be limited direct commercialization in Canada.

""We want to be an innovation center of excellence that enables the most rapid introduction of our methodology to the market, Lozuk said.

Vincere's Shukla said the test's ultimate goal is to help with screening but said she also could see the test having a role in diagnostics to determine whether something found on a mammogram needs to be biopsied or for minimal residual disease detection.

Thus far, Syantra has done preliminary work in lung and pancreatic cancer to show that the ""fingerprint"" it is detecting exists and is unique in each cancer type, he added.

Lozuk also noted that if the firm's technology garners interest from another company looking to acquire one of its tests, it would be interested in selling the technology while continuing development of its other assays.

Syantra recently finished a funding round last fall that raised $7.3 million to ensure its operations will continue through this year and plans to raise an additional $10 million to $20 million in a Series B round to commercialize the breast cancer test, finish development of the lung cancer assay, and make ""meaningful progress"" on the pancreatic cancer assay, Lozuk said.",https://crain-platform-360dx-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/app-icons/favicon.ico,N,0.0,2026-01-09 11:56:43.123240

She noted that within the USPHS, the award is highly competitive, with only three nurses selected for recognition from the 30 to 50 nominees received each quarter.

“She did not win this lightly,” said Haney. “It really is a testament to her work.”

Lassiter’s nomination highlighted her focus on workforce well-being and growth, aligning her leadership with the U.S. surgeon general’s Framework for Workplace Mental Health and Well-Being. The award also honored her mentorship of junior officers and more than 300 interagency staff members, fostering connections and professional development across teams.

“She champions opportunities for nurses through national training programs, guiding DHA development of nursing training requirements and capability-building initiatives,” said Kraft. “Her work in behavioral health, HIV/AIDS care, and trauma-informed practices ensures dignity and meaning in clinical practice.”

Lassiter revived development opportunities for her staff by securing funding, travel, and continuing education credits for events such as the 2025 Defense Health Information Technology Symposium, the 2025 Military Health System Research Symposium, and the 4th Annual AI for Defense Summit.

DHA leaders said the award reflects both Lassiter’s accomplishments and the example she sets.

“Keyonica is a fantastic asset to DHA,” said Michael Swayze, DHA chief of the capability requirements management division.

Capt. Danilo Garcia-Duenas, deputy assistant director of operations in DHA's Office of Operations, Plans, Education and Training said, “This is a very prestigious award at this level for the USPHS, and we are so grateful for having her on our staff and being able to recognize her in this way.”

As part of the recognition, Lassiter received a certificate, a DAISY pin, and a stone sculpture called “The Healer’s Touch.”

She expressed gratitude for the renowned recognition: “Thank you to the DAISY Foundation. Thank you for encouraging me.”

Recognizing Swayze’s guidance, Lassiter said, “You have been so supportive from the day that I walked in.” She highlighted the opportunity to urge other USPHS officers to consider assignments with the DHA.

“To anybody listening in the USPHS: Please come here,” she said. “DHA looks out for their people. I’m so thankful for the work I’ve been able to be a part of. It’s been tough, but I’m excited.”",https://d1ldvf68ux039x.cloudfront.net/thumbs/photos/2601/9472825/1000w_q95.jpg,N,0.0,2026-01-09 10:57:13.575603

""We do think that being part of a legislative hearing is clearly signaling the committee's prioritization of getting PAMA reform done,"" she said.
Another one-year delay is also a possibility if Congress does not pass the RESULTS Act.
This scoring change could also make the RESULTS Act more attractive to Congress in comparison.
Because CBO has previously scored permanent PAMA reform bills as costing money but temporary bills as saving money, it has made permanent reform a more difficult lift.","NEW YORK – Congress took up discussion of permanent reform of the Protecting Access to Medicare Act (PAMA) Thursday in a move that clinical lab industry stakeholders suggested was a promising sign for the prospects of the Reforming and Enhancing Sustainable Updates to Laboratory Testing Services (RESULTS) Act.

The bill, which aims to reform PAMA by using a third-party database of private payor claims to establish Medicare payment rates for laboratory tests, was one of several pieces of healthcare legislation considered during a hearing by the Health Subcommittee of the House of Representatives' Energy & Commerce (E&C) Committee.

Susan Van Meter, president of the American Clinical Lab Association (ACLA), which has been one of the bill's most prominent advocates, told 360Dx that the subcommittee's consideration of the bill was ""a huge milestone,"" noting that such hearings are typically ""a necessary part of the legislative process to move [a] bill forward.""

Van Meter, who spoke as a witness at the subcommittee hearing, suggested that the inclusion of the RESULTS Act among the bills discussed indicated it is a priority for the E&C Committee.

""We do think that being part of a legislative hearing is clearly signaling the committee's prioritization of getting PAMA reform done,"" she said.

Introduced in September, the RESULTS Act would significantly revamp the process for establishing Medicare reimbursement rates for lab testing to address the challenge of obtaining representative private payor lab reimbursement data, an issue that has hampered implementation of PAMA from the beginning.

The bill has substantial bipartisan support, with 58 cosponsors in the House and four cosponsors in the Senate, but it is uncertain whether it is a high enough priority for lawmakers to be included in any larger legislative vehicle, as would likely be necessary for it to pass. The bill's inclusion in the Thursday subcommittee hearing is an encouraging sign in that regard.

PAMA was originally scheduled to go into effect at the beginning of 2026. The continuing resolution recently passed by Congress to fund the federal government through the end of January included a one-month delay pushing PAMA implementation off through the end of January. If no action is taken in coming weeks, however, reimbursement cuts and price reporting requirements under the law will go into effect at the beginning of February.

Among the legislators to discuss the RESULTS Act during the hearing were Reps Gus Bilirakis, R-Fla., John Joyce, R-Pa., Troy Balderson, R-Ohio, and Thomas Kean, R-N.J., all cosponsors of the bill. All spoke supportively of the bill, raising concerns that in its current form, PAMA could limit patient access to lab testing and hamper innovation within the diagnostics industry.

House members including Balderson and Rep. Erin Houchin, R-Ind. specifically highlighted concerns that PAMA has negatively impacted laboratories serving rural areas and patient access in those communities.

Rep. Jay Obernolte, D-Calif., the former chair of the House task force on AI, raised the issue of AI-related innovations and their applications to the lab space, saying that ""of all the applications of AI, really the low-hanging fruit, the way it can most immediately contribute to the well-being of people is through the healthcare space and certainly the lab space, as well.""

Kean, in his comments and questions to Van Meter, also noted that if PAMA were to go into effect at the beginning of February as currently scheduled, the US Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) would be setting test prices based on private payor rates reported seven years ago, the last time lab price data was collected under the law.

This is because for the last six years Congress has passed a series of one-year delays putting off PAMA implementation. The statute has not been otherwise updated, however, meaning pricing will still be set based on 2019 data.

Another one-year delay is also a possibility if Congress does not pass the RESULTS Act. However, changes in how the Congressional Budge Office (CBO) scores the financial impact of such a temporary delay could make such legislation more difficult to pass than in previous years.

CBO has previously scored temporary PAMA delays as cost savings, which has made them an attractive option for Congress as those savings could then be used to offset other spending. The office scored the recent one-month delay, however, as costing $49 million over 10 years.

This scoring change could also make the RESULTS Act more attractive to Congress in comparison. Because CBO has previously scored permanent PAMA reform bills as costing money but temporary bills as saving money, it has made permanent reform a more difficult lift.",https://crain-platform-360dx-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/styles/1200x630/s3/AdobeStock_926841666.jpeg,N,0.0,2026-01-09 11:56:49.034557

Unlike other arms of the military, the Marines pride themselves on consistently hitting their enlistment goals. But that mission is becoming increasingly difficult despite an overall upswing in military recruitment.

From old-school methods feeling outdated to a dwindling birth rate, recruiters who are already stretched to the limit are facing more challenges, writes BI's Kelsey Baker.

It's the final installment in Kelsey's fascinating four-part investigation into the Marine Corps recruiting practices that are ""burning Marines,"" according to one Great Plains sergeant. She spoke to nearly four dozen recruiters and officials and obtained documents from a Marine Corps investigation and two Marine Corps Inspector General reports.

Kelsey's reporting found Marine Corps recruiters face an unusual degree of depression, emotional stress, and elevated risks of divorce, with 15 apparent suicides between 2015 and 2024.

Some of the challenges Marine recruiters face will sound familiar to anyone in sales.

They have a quota (enlisting two people a month) and deal with frustrating tracking tools that can slow down the process (Military Health System Genesis).

It's one thing to try to get an executive to buy some software, but it's another convincing a high schooler to sign an enlistment contract.

The situation can even become hostile, with three recruiters telling Kelsey they had guns pulled on them when visiting homes of potential enlistees.

In some cases, the pressure to meet targets led recruiters to falsify records and forge signatures. It's an issue that didn't just impact the rank-and-file recruiters, but higher-ups in the Marine Corps, as well.

The Marine Corps told Kelsey in a statement that the overwhelming majority of recruiters complete their tours successfully. ""We are not yet where we ultimately want to be,"" the service said. ""But trends are undeniably moving in the right direction.""

In the meantime, the military is getting creative with attracting enlistees. BI's Jake Gabbard observed US Army influencers at Fort Knox. You can watch the video here.",https://i.insider.com/6960304204eda4732f2ec02c?width=1200&format=jpeg,N,0.0,2026-01-09 08:56:49.436411

With today’s overly complex, burdensome duty status system, servicemembers doing similar jobs often receive different benefits due to the sheer number of duty statuses.
“The Duty Status Reform Act is a commonsense win for our Reserve and National Guard servicemembers,” said Bergman.
I’m proud to support this modernization effort to strengthen readiness and reduce bureaucracy.” “Efforts to simplify the complex duty status system began over two decades ago.
I am proud to introduce this bipartisan legislation with Rep. Bergman, who knows firsthand the issues with the current structure, and I look forward to working with the Administration and my colleagues in Congress on this critical reform.” “Duty Status Reform is a long overdue step forward for our force and the nation.","WASHINGTON DC – On Thursday, Congressmen Jack Bergman (MI-01) and Gil Cisneros (CA-31) introduced the bipartisan Duty Status Reform Act which would reduce the Reserve Component’s (RC’s) duty statuses from roughly 30 to four.

This change would create a coherent structure, ensuring our servicemembers receive equitable benefits and pay when called to service.

The legislation is cosponsored by Reps, Ted Lieu (CA-36) and Sam Graves (MO-6).

The bill is endorsed by the National Guard Association of the United States (NGAUS), Reserve Organization of America (ROA), Enlisted Association of the National Guard of the United States (EANGUS), and Military Officers Association of America (MOAA).

With today’s overly complex, burdensome duty status system, servicemembers doing similar jobs often receive different benefits due to the sheer number of duty statuses. This construct has created major disparities for troop pay and benefits like TRICARE and the Post-9/11 GI Bill.

Under the new duty statuses established in this bill, servicemembers carrying out assignments within the same category will receive the same pay and benefits package.

“The Duty Status Reform Act is a commonsense win for our Reserve and National Guard servicemembers,” said Bergman. “It cuts through decades of red tape to make sure those who serve get consistent benefits, clear orders, and the support they’ve earned – whether they’re responding to disasters at home or missions abroad. I’m proud to support this modernization effort to strengthen readiness and reduce bureaucracy.”

“Efforts to simplify the complex duty status system began over two decades ago. We owe it to our servicemembers to deliver this much-needed change and ensure they are receiving equitable pay and benefits,” said Cisneros. “This was my number one priority returning to Congress. Having worked on this issue during my time at the Pentagon, I learned about the complexity of the current duty status system and how it hurts our readiness and quality of life for servicemembers. I am proud to introduce this bipartisan legislation with Rep. Bergman, who knows firsthand the issues with the current structure, and I look forward to working with the Administration and my colleagues in Congress on this critical reform.”

“Duty Status Reform is a long overdue step forward for our force and the nation. The National Guard has protected the homeland for nearly four centuries. As our tempo of operations has increased, it requires increased accessibility and flexibility,” said Major General (retired) Francis McGinn, president of NGAUS. “This legislation streamlines an overly complex system of over 30 duty statuses into four categories, cleans up nearly 300 laws, saves taxpayer dollars, and requires no additional scoring. We are grateful to Congressmen Cisneros and Bergman for leading this charge and we look forward to working with Congress to accomplish this much needed reform.”

“This is a great step forward for the eight hundred thousand plus men and women of the Reserve Components,” Command Sergeant Major (retired) John D. Gipe, Executive Director of EANGUS “Duty Status Reform has been a topic of discussion and studies for over fifteen years. Finally, with the help of Representatives Cisneros and Bergman, this important modernization of the laws that support our Servicemembers and their Families is moving forward. Our Warriors will finally get the benefits they deserve for performing their service in uniform. The Soldiers and Airmen of the National Guard, along with their Reserve counterparts, are grateful to all who have had a hand in bringing this issue to the forefront.”

“Duty Status Reform replaces a burdensome maze of statutory authorities governing reserve service with a clear, predictable framework, allowing the military to operate faster and directly tying service to defined pay and benefit entitlements,” said Major General (retired) John Hashem, CEO of ROA. “It ensures uniform benefit accrual, reduces record disputes, and delivers equal DoD/W and VA benefits for identical service.”

“This legislation addressing Duty Status Reform simplifies the Pentagon’s access to the Reserve Forces helping maintain mission readiness and enhancing force posture,” said Jimmy Santos, Director of MOAA. “For servicemembers in the Reserve, it guarantees equal delivery of benefits to include healthcare and the housing allowance.”",https://ogden_images.s3.amazonaws.com/www.thealpenanews.com/images/2022/10/09200626/bergman-WEB-667x500.jpg,N,0.0,2026-01-09 08:56:53.738339

To better support this readiness posture, the clinic is now equipped to handle complex procedures that were previously outsourced.

“They've been referring out a lot of procedures: root canals, implants, wisdom teeth,” said U.S. Air Force Capt. Thomas Hardison, Maxwell Medical Group comprehensive dentist. “And so being here and having the training to do those procedures brought a lot of care back in-house.”

The dental flight’s role is critical in clearing Airmen for deployment, often requiring the team to react with urgency to meet short-notice mission requirements.

“When patients are deploying, we ensure that they are ready to go. If they do have things that are limiting them from going, we will stop what we're doing to get them out the door,” said U.S. Air Force Tech. Sgt. Ernessie Ladouceur, Maxwell Medical Group dental flight chief.

While bringing back sedation capabilities has been the most recent focus at the clinic, there are several types of procedures the flight also aims to bring back.

“We'll do implants, sinus lifts, ridge augmentation, and other periodontal surgeries,” said Hardison.

Modernization has been a key component of the clinic's enhanced capabilities, with a renewed focus on digital dentistry. This shift reduces chair time for patients and improves the precision of care through advanced technology.

“We have two 3D printers up and running now,” said Hardison. “We do most everything digitally now. So, we scan everything, 3D print models, and mill restorations.”

Keeping these advanced procedures within the military health system provides a direct benefit to the patient by ensuring all their medical information is centralized and accessible.

“I think the impact is the continuity of care. More patients are being able to have their care here with us and not seeing a provider off base,” said Ladouceur. “It’s one less thing they have to worry about.”

The flight’s core function is ensuring every Airman is medically prepared for global operations.

“The unit's overall mission is to make sure that our active-duty members are able to be fit and ready,” said Ladouceur. “So that way when they're out there, they're not having to worry about something like a toothache.”","https://www.montgomeryadvertiser.com/gcdn/authoring/authoring-images/2026/01/01/PMOY/87981865007-251009-fuq-9301378.jpg?crop=6047,3402,x0,y0&width=3200&height=1801&format=pjpg&auto=webp",N,0.0,2026-01-09 08:56:59.662217

The defense health agency data platform is changing how the U.S. military delivers healthcare to 9.6 million beneficiaries worldwide. Here’s what you need to know:

Key Components:

MHS Information Platform (MIP) – The largest secondary repository of health data in the DoD, consolidating over 1 petabyte of data from 35+ sources

MHS GENESIS – The modernized electronic health record system replacing fragmented legacy systems

Common Data Model – Standardizes health data vocabulary across all systems for seamless interoperability

Operation Helios – The largest data migration in DHA history, moving 30 years of health records into a unified platform

Primary Goals:

Enable real-time, data-driven clinical decisions

Support military readiness through predictive analytics

Eliminate data silos across 164,000 daily patient encounters

Prepare infrastructure for AI/ML adoption

Ensure secure, compliant data governance (HIPAA, FISMA)

For decades, military healthcare relied on disconnected systems—53 inpatient platforms, 140 outpatient systems, and hundreds of business intelligence tools scattered across the globe. This fragmentation meant providers couldn’t access complete patient histories. Service members carried paper records. Critical health data sat trapped in silos while decisions waited.

That era is ending. Through strategic modernization initiatives like the Military Health System Information Platform (MIP) and the deployment of MHS GENESIS, the Defense Health Agency is building a unified, secure, and intelligent data ecosystem. The goal isn’t just better technology—it’s better outcomes. Faster care. Lives saved.

I’m Maria Chatzou Dunford, CEO and Co-founder of Lifebit, where we’ve spent over a decade building federated data platforms that enable secure, real-time analytics across complex healthcare ecosystems. Our work with public sector institutions mirrors many of the challenges the defense health agency data platform addresses—breaking down data silos, enabling AI-ready infrastructure, and ensuring compliance without sacrificing speed or collaboration.

The primary goal driving the Defense Health Agency’s (DHA) data platform change is nothing less than enhancing military readiness, boosting operational effectiveness, and ensuring patient safety. Imagine a world where every service member, veteran, and their family receives seamless, personalized care, no matter where they are or when they need it. This vision is being realized by changing raw data into a strategic, trusted asset.

From Chaos to Clarity: Breaking Down Data Barriers

For too long, the military health system wrestled with data silos – a hidden threat to both care and readiness. Before the current change, the DHA grappled with “a hodgepodge of older, distributed systems” from the 1990s, including 53 instances of inpatient systems and 140 outpatient systems. This fragmentation meant that health authorities and contractors would often stay up late trying to gather and coordinate information from 451 military treatment facilities. This disconnected approach led to inefficiencies, duplicate efforts, and a lack of a comprehensive patient view.

Our experience building federated data platforms for governments and public health agencies in the UK, Canada, Singapore, and across Europe has shown us that this fragmentation isn’t unique to any single system. It’s a common pain point that demands a strategic response.

The modernization mandate for DHA is clear and urgent. The COVID-19 pandemic, for instance, significantly accelerated the need for modernized data platforms in military medicine, highlighting the critical importance of rapid data access for decision-makers. The DHA’s 2023 Strategic Plan outlines a clear path towards an “agile, data-driven, virtual-first, human-centered model of care.” This ambitious plan aims to support wartime skills, clinical currency, medical readiness requirements at a global scale, and deliver value- and outcome-based care.

This strategic plan is also building a crucial foundation for AI and advanced analytics. The DHA is actively preparing its data infrastructure to effectively support and leverage cutting-edge technologies like Artificial Intelligence (AI), Machine Learning (ML), Natural Language Processing (NLP), and Optical Character Recognition (OCR). A modernized data platform, as described by experts, allows decision-makers to work faster and enables AI to augment their work, turning complex data into actionable insights.

The Key Players and Their Roles

A change of this magnitude requires dedicated leadership and specialized teams. At the helm of the DHA is Lt. Gen. Telita Crosland, who serves as the director, overseeing nine medical centers, 36 hospitals, 525 clinics, and 138 dental facilities worldwide, serving 9.6 million beneficiaries. Under her guidance, the DHA’s data strategy is firmly aligned with the broader Department of Defense (DoD) Data Strategy and AI readiness roadmap.

The Enterprise Intelligence and Data Solutions (EIDS) Program Management Office (PMO) plays a pivotal role in this change. EIDS manages the Military Health System Information Platform (MIP), which is the largest secondary repository of health-related data in the DoD. EIDS offers five core capabilities: Legacy Data Consolidation, Workflow Application, Information Portal, Analytics Workbench, and a Data Science Laboratory.

Other key Program Management Offices (PEOs) driving this integration include the Program Executive Office (PEO) for Medical Systems, which is an acquisition organization attached to the DHA. This office is responsible for acquiring and delivering healthcare technology. The DHMSM PMO oversees the deployment and sustainment of MHS GENESIS, while the Joint Operational Medicine Information Systems (JOMIS) PMO develops and sustains IT systems for deployed forces. These PEOs are instrumental in delivering digitally centered health care to warfighters around the world, ensuring that the necessary technologies are in place and functioning effectively.

Inside the Defense Health Agency Data Platform

At the heart of the DHA’s data strategy is the Military Health System Information Platform (MIP). This platform represents a monumental leap forward in consolidating and managing vast amounts of healthcare data. The MIP is not just a storage facility; it’s a dynamic system designed to make data accessible and actionable.

The MHS Information Platform (MIP): DHA’s Data Powerhouse

The scale of the MIP is truly staggering. Through a strategic modernization initiative known as Operation Helios, the DHA has completed what’s been called the largest data standardization and migration operation in its history. This involved moving over 1 petabyte of data, which is a mind-boggling one quadrillion bytes, or one million gigabytes. This massive undertaking, executed in carefully planned phases, consolidated data from over 35 disparate sources, including the Armed Forces Health Longitudinal Technology Application (AHLTA), the Composite Health Care System (CHCS), and Essentris®, as well as various ancillary pharmacy, lab, and radiology systems. The process involved complex Extract, Transform, and Load (ETL) pipelines built to handle the unique formats and structures of each legacy system. Hosted on a secure government cloud environment, these pipelines performed intensive data validation and cleansing before loading the information into the MIP, processing an astounding 60 billion records annually.

This isn’t just about moving data; it’s about changing it into a powerful tool for analytics. Previously, analysts would spend up to 80% of their time simply trying to find, access, and merge data from separate repositories like the MHS Data Repository (MDR) and MHS Mart (M2), often with conflicting or incomplete results. Now, the MIP lays the essential groundwork for advanced data analytics capabilities, including big data analysis, Natural Language Processing (NLP), visualizations, and semantic analysis. This means we can move from simply storing information to actively leveraging it for real-world impact, providing seamless data services and decision support for clinicians, patients, beneficiaries, analysts, researchers, and DoD leadership.

By creating a single source of truth, the MIP is designed to eliminate redundant data, reduce operational costs, and significantly improve the provider experience. This consolidation is a critical step towards a more efficient and effective military health system.

Standardizing the Language of Health: The Common Data Model

Imagine trying to understand medical records from different hospitals, each using their own unique terms for the same condition. It would be a nightmare! This is why data standardization is the backbone of interoperability, and why the DHA’s adoption of a Common Data Model (CDM) is so crucial.

The DHA’s Strategic Plan for fiscal years 2023-2028 emphasizes the adoption of a CDM to standardize data definitions. For example, a diagnosis of “obstructive sleep apnea” might have been recorded in one legacy system using an ICD-9 code (327.23), in another as free text in a clinical note, and in MHS GENESIS with an ICD-10 code (G47.33). The OMOP CDM, through standardized vocabularies like SNOMED CT, maps all these variations to a single, unambiguous concept ID. This allows researchers to query for “all patients with obstructive sleep apnea” and receive a complete, accurate cohort without needing to understand the idiosyncrasies of dozens of legacy systems. This vocabulary standardization is vital for enabling seamless care and research. Our experience shows that a standardized vocabulary is foundational for any effective federated data platform, allowing disparate datasets to speak the same language.

The DHA is leveraging the Observational Medical Outcomes Partnership (OMOP) common data model, a widely adopted standard developed through a public-private collaboration. The choice of OMOP was strategic, driven by its robust open-source toolset, strong international community support via the Observational Health Data Sciences and Informatics (OHDSI) community, and its design for enabling large-scale observational research—a key goal for the DHA. This community, boasting over 2,000 collaborators across 74 countries and health records for about 810 million unique patients, provides invaluable guidance and tools.

This standardization effort directly benefits patient care and military readiness by leading to more reliable diagnoses and treatment. It also streamlines research by enabling faster integration of data, even across international partners. Interoperability with other federal agencies, such as the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), becomes a reality. The VA, in fact, is undergoing a similar initiative, and the close collaboration on CDM mapping is not just about technical alignment; it aims to enable joint research on health issues affecting both populations, such as traumatic brain injury (TBI) and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), and to create a foundation for a truly seamless lifetime health record for service members as they transition to veteran status.

Governance and Security: Building Trust in Every Byte

In the complex world of military healthcare, data isn’t just information; it’s a matter of national security and individual well-being. Therefore, robust governance and uncompromising security are paramount. Our work with governments and public health agencies across the UK, Europe, Canada, and Singapore underscores the critical importance of these pillars in any successful data platform.

Federated Governance: Secure Collaboration Without Centralization

The DHA aims to create a unified, secure, intelligent, and compliant data ecosystem without centralizing data into a single platform. This is a nuanced but powerful approach, embracing a decentralized data model. This strategy is about empowering domain experts and maintaining data sovereignty, allowing data to reside where it is generated while still being accessible for analysis.

The DHA is utilizing a prototype data mesh architecture to modernize its enterprise data infrastructure, supporting domain-driven data ownership and federated governance. This approach aligns perfectly with our philosophy at Lifebit, where our federated AI platform enables secure collaboration across hybrid data ecosystems without ever moving sensitive data. It means data can be exchanged and analyzed securely, preserving privacy and ensuring that control remains with the data owners. This is particularly vital for national defense, where data sovereignty is a non-negotiable requirement.

Protecting Patient Data: Compliance and Security in Action

Protecting patient data is not just a best practice; it’s a legal and ethical imperative. The DHA’s data framework is built to meet the highest standards of regulatory compliance, including the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA), and protecting Personally Identifiable Information (PII) and Protected Health Information (PHI). Given the military context, compliance also extends to the Federal Information Security Modernization Act (FISMA) and other stringent DoD cybersecurity requirements.

These protections are implemented through multiple layers:

Access Controls: Rigorous role-based access control (RBAC) ensures that only authorized personnel can access specific data elements. As seen in the VA’s Health Data and Analytics Platform (HDAP), access is carefully managed and monitored.

Encryption: Data is encrypted both at rest and in transit, safeguarding it from unauthorized access during storage and transmission.

Auditing: Comprehensive auditing and logging mechanisms track all data access and activity, providing an immutable record for accountability and compliance checks.

Continuous Monitoring and Risk Management: The DHA implements robust risk management measures and continuous monitoring to identify and mitigate potential vulnerabilities proactively. The VA’s HDAP, for instance, undergoes regular risk reviews and maintains a FIPS 199 classification of MODERATE, indicating a strong security posture.

Formalizing data stewardship and lifecycle management is also a critical component, with clear roles, responsibilities, and accountability for data ownership established across the enterprise. This holistic approach ensures that every byte of data is handled with the utmost care and integrity.

The Future Is Now: AI, Analytics, and Real-World Impact

The change of the defense health agency data platform isn’t just about organizing existing data; it’s about releaseing its full potential through advanced technologies. The future of military healthcare is being shaped by AI, ML, and sophisticated analytics, turning data into actionable insights that save lives and improve care.

AI in Action: Changing Military Readiness and Patient Care

The DHA is actively preparing its data infrastructure to support and leverage advanced technologies like AI, ML, and NLP. This preparation lays the foundation for future data analytics capabilities, including big data analysis, advanced visualizations, and semantic analysis. Our experience building AI-driven platforms for large-scale biomedical research demonstrates that clean, harmonized data is the fuel for these powerful engines.

Augmented Decision-Making for Clinicians and Commanders: A modernized data platform allows decision-makers to work faster and enables AI to augment their work. This means clinicians can make more informed diagnoses and treatment plans, while commanders have a clearer common operating picture to make critical operational decisions. This “augmented leadership decision-making” is a direct benefit of the data change.

Predictive Health: Stopping Problems Before They Start: The ability to leverage predictive analytics means anticipating needs and preventing crises. By analyzing vast datasets, the system can identify patterns and risks, helping clinicians “head off costly medical situations” before they escalate. This proactive approach shifts healthcare from reactive to preventive.

Operational Triage: Prioritizing Care When Seconds Count: In high-stress environments, seconds count. Integrated medical systems can deliver critical information needed for health and injury concerns, providing predictive analytics and machine teaming to “save lives and improve operational triage.” This ensures that the right care is delivered to the right person at the right time.

Personalized Medicine: Tailoring Care to Every Service Member: The DHA is shifting from a “one-size-fits-all approach to a personalized healthcare experience” for service members and veterans. Integrating clinical and genomic data, as we do in our platforms, is crucial for personalized medicine and accelerated research translation. This allows for tailoring care to every individual, optimizing outcomes based on their unique health profile.

Real Benefits for Service Members and Veterans

This data change translates into tangible benefits for service members, veterans, and their families:

Longitudinal Patient Records: Seamless Care Across Deployments: With a unified system, service members no longer have to carry paper medical records. Instead, a “longitudinal patient record” ensures that all relevant data is available to providers, regardless of where the care is delivered—whether in the US, Germany, or Korea. This drastically improves continuity of care across deployments and transitions.

Proactive Healthcare: From Reactive to Preventive: The ability to use predictive analysis means healthcare can be more proactive, identifying potential issues before they become major problems. This leads to better long-term health outcomes.

Reduced Paperwork, Improved Safety, Family Health Support: Digitization promises to boost efficiency by reducing the burden of paperwork. With comprehensive data, patient safety is improved through more informed decisions. Furthermore, the goal is to provide a “digital front door” for patients, allowing self-service tasks like prescription refills, appointment scheduling, and secure communication, extending support to families as well.

Challenges and the Road Ahead

Changing an organization as vast and complex as the DHA is no small feat. We’ve seen similar challenges in our work with large-scale government and public health initiatives globally. The road ahead for the defense health agency data platform involves navigating several significant problems.

Overcoming Problems: How DHA Is Building a Resilient Data Platform

Data Quality: Cleaning Up Decades of Legacy Data: One of the most significant challenges is ensuring data quality. Migrating over 1 petabyte of data, including 30 years of MHS data from legacy systems like the MHS Data Repository (MDR) and MHS Mart (M2), inevitably involves tackling inconsistencies and ensuring accuracy. This process involves more than just mapping fields; it requires sophisticated algorithms for patient de-duplication to create a single “golden record” for each beneficiary who may have been registered multiple times across different facilities over 30 years. Automated data quality rules are run continuously to flag anomalies, such as illogical dates or out-of-range lab values, while teams of data stewards manually curate and correct critical data elements. The accuracy of this historical data is paramount for longitudinal studies and predictive modeling.

Cultural Shift: Training and Change Management: Technology adoption is as much about people as it is about platforms. There’s a need for a “cultural shift at the speed of relevance for patients,” acknowledging that users vary widely in their readiness for digital tools. To manage this, the DHA has implemented a multi-faceted change management strategy. This includes role-based training modules for clinicians, nurses, administrators, and researchers, ensuring each user group understands how the new tools impact their specific workflows. Furthermore, a network of “clinical champions” and super-users has been established at military treatment facilities worldwide. These individuals receive advanced training and act as on-the-ground peer leaders, advocating for the new system, providing immediate support, and channeling user feedback directly to the program offices to drive iterative improvements.

Legacy System Integration: Bridging Old and New: The DHA has had to replace a “hodgepodge” of older systems, consolidating disparate networks into a unified system and implementing MHS GENESIS. The challenge lies in seamlessly integrating these new platforms with remaining legacy systems during the transition, ensuring that historical data is accessible and future data flows smoothly without interruption to clinical care. This requires building and maintaining a complex web of interfaces and application programming interfaces (APIs) that can bridge the gap between modern, cloud-native applications and decades-old mainframe systems until the latter can be fully and safely decommissioned.

User Adoption: Making the Platform Work for Everyone: With over 20,000 users impacted by these changes, minimizing disruption and ensuring that the new platform is intuitive and beneficial is crucial for successful user adoption. The feedback loops created through the clinical champion network are vital for this, allowing for rapid adjustments to user interfaces and workflows based on real-world use.

Scalability: Preparing for Tomorrow’s Demands: The data infrastructure must be resilient and scalable to handle ever-increasing volumes of data and new technological demands, especially as AI and ML capabilities expand. Our federated cloud-native architectures are designed specifically for this kind of future-proofing, ensuring platforms can grow with demand.

Tackling technical debt and legacy complexity has required a monumental effort. The DHA’s “Desktop to Datacenter” program, for example, consolidated separate Army, Navy, and DHA Medical networks into one unified network with a single help desk. Aligning stakeholders and securing funding has also been critical, involving extensive collaboration across multiple program offices, military hospitals, clinics, and global leaders.

Finally, inter-agency collaboration is breaking down bureaucratic barriers. The close partnership with the VA on data standardization, for instance, ensures interoperability and common approaches. This collaboration is formalized through joint working groups and leverages the Federal Health Information Exchange (HIE) to enable bidirectional data sharing. The ultimate goal is a more integrated federal health ecosystem where a service member’s complete health record is securely and seamlessly available to VA providers the day they transition to veteran status, eliminating dangerous gaps in care and the administrative burden on the individual.

Conclusion The 2026 TRICARE updates reinforce a familiar reality for therapy practices.","2026 has officially begun, bringing new updates across the healthcare industry, particularly within TRICARE. These annual updates are designed to align coverage, costs, and care delivery with federal guidelines and evolving healthcare needs.

For 2026, TRICARE has introduced meaningful changes related to cost structures, coverage expansion, and care supervision. They directly influence reimbursement, patient access, compliance requirements, and billing workflows.

Staying informed is essential for therapy providers. Understanding these changes early helps practices adapt smoothly, reduce administrative disruptions, and continue delivering consistent care to TRICARE beneficiaries.

This blog outlines the key TRICARE updates for 2026, including industry-wide and regional changes, while focusing on how they impact therapy specialties.

What’s New in TRICARE for 2026?

In 2026, TRICARE introduced several updates affecting plan costs, pharmacy benefits, regional plan administration, and expanded medical coverage. While not all changes directly alter therapy services, they influence overall patient costs, access patterns, and admin conversations within therapy practices.

Industry-Wide Updates and Benefit Changes

Increased Plan Costs: Most TRICARE plan costs, including enrollment fees, deductibles, copayments, and premiums, increased modestly for 2026, generally aligning with annual retiree COLA adjustments.

Pharmacy Copayment Changes: For most beneficiaries using retail network pharmacies and home delivery services, pharmacy copayments have increased with variations across formulary tiers.

Expanded Medical Coverage: TRICARE implemented routine coverage updates for 2026, including formulary adjustments and alignment with updated clinical guidelines. These changes are administrative and clinical refinements, not major benefit expansions, and have minimal direct impact on therapy services.

Please note that these medical coverage updates do not change eligibility or reimbursement rules for ABA, PT, OT, or speech therapy services.

Regional Updates

New TRICARE Prime Competitive Plans Demonstration: Beginning January 1, 2026, eligible beneficiaries in select ZIP codes within metro Atlanta, GA, and Tampa, FL, can enroll in a new TRICARE Prime option managed by CareSource Military & Veterans (CSMV).

Enrollment Flexibility Update: TRICARE previously used temporary waivers allowing some beneficiaries to remain enrolled after certain relocations. These flexibilities have now ended, and standard Prime access rules apply.

For detailed TRICARE health plan cost information, beneficiaries should refer directly to the official TRICARE website.

How 2026 TRICARE Updates Impact Therapy Specialties?

TRICARE updates affect multiple areas of the healthcare system, including therapy services such as ABA, physical therapy, speech therapy, and occupational therapy. While coverage structures remain largely intact, several operational and access-related changes influence how therapy services are delivered and reimbursed.

Expanded Virtual Care: Telehealth and virtual care remain a permanent part of TRICARE coverage, whenever clinically appropriate and allowed by benefit rules.

Provider Network Stability Concerns: Some therapy practices reported unpaid claims and credentialing challenges following the 2025 transition to new regional contractors. This can affect continuity of care as providers exit networks, especially in the West Region under TriWest Healthcare Alliance. Therapists must regularly update their information with regional contractions (Humana Military for East, TriWest for West), to avoid payment delays.

Autism Care Demonstration (ACD): ABA remains covered under the Demonstration and has not yet been transitioned into a basic TRICARE benefit. Providers must continue meeting all compliance and documentation requirements to maintain coverage and reimbursement.

What do These Changes Mean for Therapy Practices?

While the 2026 TRICARE updates do not significantly alter therapy benefit structures, they introduce operational challenges. Changes in costs, regional administration, and referral workflows require therapy practices to focus on accuracy, oversight, and clear communication across clinical and administrative teams.

Some of the key operational impacts include:

Increased Billing Complexity: Annual cost adjustments, regional contractor workflows, and ongoing specialty-specific requirements make TRICARE billing complex.

Higher Claim Denial Risks: Even minor issues in eligibility verification, referrals, or authorizations can result in delayed or denied claims under TRICARE.

Eligibility and Authorization Errors: Inaccurate DEERS information, outdated referrals, or missed authorization renewals for programs like ACD can disrupt care and reimbursement.

Greater Patient Inquiries About Costs and Coverage: Rising copayments and plan cost changes often lead to increased questions from beneficiaries, placing additional demands on front-desk and billing teams.

For therapy practices, it’s essential to stay ahead of these operational impacts by implementing proactive systems and consistent verification processes. Additionally, they can improve performance by gaining clear visibility into patient eligibility, authorizations, and claims status.

How TherapyPM Helps You Stay Compliant with 2026 TRICARE Updates?

Adapting to the 2026 TRICARE updates doesn’t have to feel like walking through fog. TherapyPM equips your practice with the tools to navigate eligibility changes, manage authorizations, and simplify billing workflows. The therapy software reduces your administrative burden and costly errors.

Here’s how TherapyPM supports your team with these TRICARE changes:

Centralized Authorization Management: Track referral and authorization status in real time, receive alerts for upcoming renewals, and store documentation in structured and searchable folders.

Efficient Insurance Billing: Verify TRICARE eligibility and benefits before service delivery, submit claims with clean & compliant data, reduce manual data entry, monitor claim status, and resolve denials faster.

Fewer Eligibility Errors, Faster Patient Service: Catch potential errors earlier, such as incorrect DEERS data or outdated referrals. Verify coverage and confirm authorizations before treatment starts, to keep patients informed and reduce frustration.

Better Patient Communication Around Costs & Coverage: With plan cost changes in TRICARE for 2026, patients are more likely to ask questions about copays, deductibles, and benefits. TherapyPM gives your team clear visibility into benefit details, so you can answer confidently and schedule smoothly.

TherapyPM doesn’t just help you process TRICARE claims. It gives your practice the controls and visibility you need to stay compliant, avoid denials, and manage administrative tasks confidently.

Conclusion

The 2026 TRICARE updates reinforce a familiar reality for therapy practices. While coverage structures may remain largely stable, the administrative and operational demands continue to evolve. Changes in plan costs, regional administration, and ongoing compliance requirements, particularly for programs like Autism Care Demonstration (ACD), require therapy providers to stay proactive and well-informed.

For ABA, physical, speech, and occupational therapy practices, success in 2026 depends on accurate eligibility verification, timely authorizations, and clean billing workflows. Staying ahead of these requirements not only helps prevent denials and payment delays. It also ensures uninterrupted care for TRICARE beneficiaries and their families.

With TherapyPM, navigating TRICARE updates becomes easier. Therapy practices can use these tools to improve visibility, reduce administrative errors, and simplify day-to-day operations. This can help maintain compliance, efficiency, and help patients focus on what matters the most, i.e., delivering high-quality care.

During the Building a Healthy Home Front forum, at the Association of the United States Army’s 2025 annual meeting, Lt. Gen. Mary K. Izaguirre, Surgeon General of the Army, said, “We’re working with our partners at the Defense Health Agency to effectively support that treatment part of the health, bringing virtual care to remote areas…(and) leveraging technology…and humans to provide care.”

“If we can leverage AI to be that entryway, and then triage, then we can preserve those human touchpoints that need that level of care,” she said.

BRAVE has hosted approximately 60,000 virtual therapy sessions since it was launched three years ago. The program is now available at 84 locations across the U.S., Europe and Indo-Pacific region. DHA plans for BRAVE to be available worldwide by the end of this year.

In a release from DHA, the agency said BRAVE has used teleconferencing to reduce patient wait times and provide confidential access to therapy services. The platform’s team of service providers consists of licensed clinical social workers, psychologists and therapists.

BRAVE is managed by the DHA Virtual Medical Center, which offers several other telehealth tools, including the VMC Virtually Integrated Provider Readiness and Remote Clinic, the MHS Patient Portal and MHS Nurse Advice Line. DHA VMC ensures that members of the Army community receive the best possible care through modernized military medicine.

DHA’s BRAVE virtual services are not to be confused with My Military Health's SilverCloud, which ended in July of this year.

Maj. Manuel Cruz hosted a conversation with DHA headquarters staff from Falls Church, Virginia, Dec. 12.

Smith expressed his gratitude to the workforce for their dedication and resilience in 2025 and relayed positive feedback he received from engagements with combatant command leadership, citing recent visits with leaders at U.S. Northern Command as “one of our biggest advocates” as well as similar comments from U.S. Space Command. He acknowledged the key role of DHA’s liaison officers and staff assigned to serve at combatant command headquarters in “helping us understand what we can do to support” the COCOM missions with DHA’s medical capabilities. “It’s such an honor to be a part of this team. I really appreciate what you all do,” he added.

Smith discussed recent leadership changes and announced Force Master Chief PatrickPaul C. Mangaran as the new DHA Command Senior Enlisted Leader as of Jan. 6, 2026.

A clear focus for every team member

Both Smith and DHA Chief of Staff, Maj. Gen. Timothy Brennan highlighted the FY26 Mission Focused Directive to reinforce the importance of preparedness for a future conflict and the agency’s sacred obligation to provide lifesaving care on and off the battlefield. “From tracking global blood supply to bed spaces across military hospitals and clinics,” Brennan challenged the team to constantly ask hard questions about our readiness to support combat operations. ""Are we ready today to start picking up that mantle and ensure service members forward deployed have everything they need to be successful?” he added.

He stressed that every member of the DHA team contributes to the agency’s lines of effort as outlined in the FY26 Mission Focused Directive.

Innovation to support the mission

Smith highlighted key initiatives designed to modernize the enterprise and empower the workforce, including the October 2025 rollout of universal credentialing and privileging for all active duty, Reserve, and government civilian providers to improve medical readiness and access to care.

He also hailed the limited fielding of the ambient listening tool as a “true game changer for our ability to provide health care … and a real win for the enterprise.” Generating patient notes in minutes, the tool will free up providers from documenting the encounter to focus on the patient’s care during the visit. The limited release took place at Madigan Army Medical Center, Naval Medical Center Portsmouth, Wilford Hall Ambulatory Surgical Center, and Naval Medical Center Camp Lejeune in advance of projected enterprise rollout early next year.

Supporting our most valuable asset: our people

Rounding out the briefing, Cruz highlighted the importance of checking in with teammates ahead of the holidays. He discussed the robust employee support resources available through DHA’s civilian Employee Assistance Program and Military OneSource. The National Resource Directory managed by Warrior Care is another useful resource.

Reflecting on DHA’s core values of dependability, humility and agility, Cruz emphasized that “DHA is every single one of you … you are valued and the work you do is valued … it takes all of us together to make the mission happen.”

During the Q&A session, leaders fielded questions on the effects of the federal hiring freeze on senior leader positions, requirements-based budget requests, feedback from combatant commands on DHA’s combat support activities, and more.

Within that arm of the study, both patients and providers knew their test results, which could have influenced their behaviors.
""That limitation is precisely why preterm birth remains such a persistent public health problem,"" Iriye said.
Zhenya Lindgardt, president and CEO of Sera Prognostics, said via email that the PRIME study provides strong evidence that the PreTRM Test improves outcomes.
Lindgardt said that Sera will continue to mine the PRIME study dataset while maintaining a ""steady cadence"" of research publications and presentations.","NEW YORK – Results of a clinical trial of over 5,000 women showed that Sera Prognostics' PreTRM liquid biopsy paired with targeted treatments reduced the risk of preterm births and improved outcomes for infants born with certain complications.

The PreTRM assay is a mid-second-trimester maternal blood liquid biopsy that analyzes the ratio of insulin-like growth factor-binding protein 4 (IGFBP4) to sex hormone-binding globulin (SHBG), both circulating proteins that are associated with preterm birth.

The effectiveness of this lab-developed test (LDT) in identifying women with higher risk of spontaneous preterm birth and in helping physicians tailor treatment plans was assessed in the randomized, controlled PRIME study, conducted at 19 sites across the US. The results were published on Wednesday in the journal Pregnancy.

In it, researchers primarily sought to compare newborn morbidity and mortality between patients randomized to receive a bundled treatment consisting of daily vaginal progesterone, low-dose aspirin, and nurse-led care management based on their PreTRM results and those assigned to receive standard care (the control arm). Other outcomes measured in the study included comparisons of the overall length of hospital stays for newborns, length of NICU stays, and any increases in gestation times.

The study's authors found that biomarker testing combined with targeted therapy resulted in overall hospital stays that were approximately 6 percent shorter, on average, than stays by newborns in the control arm.

Although the length of time spent by newborns in the NICU did not significantly differ between study arms, participants in the trial's PreTRM arm saw approximately 20 percent fewer babies admitted to the NICU compared to the control arm. The study's authors calculated that this translates to screening approximately 39 women using Sera Prognostics' test to prevent a day in the NICU. By comparison, the study authors estimated that 150 women would need to be screened using standard approaches for the same effect.

Gestational age at birth –– the point during the pregnancy when a baby is born –– also did not significantly differ between groups, overall, although investigators did observe generally fewer preterm births in the PreTRM group, particularly for births occurring prior to weeks 32 through 35.

Newborns in the biomarker screening group also tended to experience fewer postnatal complications than those in the control arm. Two newborns in the control arm died from complications related to premature birth, while no deaths were recorded in the biomarker screening arm.

Importantly, the trial excluded women with prior spontaneous preterm birth or premature cervical shortening at enrollment, helping to ensure that its results are relevant to populations not typically flagged by current screening approaches.

The study's investigators acknowledged that the trial's open-label design and unblinded biomarker screening and treatment arm could have influenced its results. Within that arm of the study, both patients and providers knew their test results, which could have influenced their behaviors. Providers, for example, might have altered treatment strategies by increasing surveillance and/or treatments, while patients may have altered certain behaviors to reduce any perceived risks.

However, the authors argued that blinding the screening group was not completely feasible due to the associated treatment bundle, and that in any case, this more closely reflected what one would expect from the real-world clinical implementation of this strategy.

Brian Iriye, president of Hera Women's Health and principal investigator for the PRIME study, said via email that a reliable early screening tool such as the PreTRM test constitutes a meaningful advance in managing the risk of preterm birth as few scalable and effective interventions for it currently exist, particularly in the general obstetric population.

""That limitation is precisely why preterm birth remains such a persistent public health problem,"" Iriye said.

Zhenya Lindgardt, president and CEO of Sera Prognostics, said via email that the PRIME study provides strong evidence that the PreTRM Test improves outcomes.

""We’re confident that providers and payers who understand the impact of the test will want it for their patients and members,"" she said. ""Having gold standard evidence in a peer-reviewed publication allows policy review coverage processes to commence to evaluate PreTRM for reimbursement.""

Lindgardt said that Sera is now focused on driving awareness of the PRIME study's results across clinical and payer communities through education programs, conference participation, and field sales campaigns.

In a statement from the company, Lindgardt also noted that the PRIME study's results reinforce those from the earlier AVERT PRETERM study, an earlier trial sponsored by Christiana Care Health Services that similarly evaluated the impact that screening via the PreTRM assay had on neonatal morbidity and mortality. The results of that study also showed reductions in hospital stays and medical complications among the newborns of women who had been screened with the PreTRM test and received the same treatments as those in the PRIME study.

Iriye said that several follow-on efforts are currently underway, building on the results of PRIME. He and his colleagues, for instance, are conducting an economic analysis of the PRIME trial.

""Given that NICU admissions and neonatal lengths of stay represent some of the largest drivers of perinatal healthcare costs, understanding the cost-effectiveness and budget impact of a biomarker-guided strategy is an essential next step,"" he said.

These data will likely play a large role in pursuing payer adoption, which Iriye described as the most immediate barrier to its broader implementation.

""Introducing any new screening strategy requires payers to assess not only the upfront cost of the test, but also the downstream clinical and economic impact,"" he said, adding that costs associated with the approximately 10 percent of infants who require neonatal care roughly equal the total professional fees of maternal care of the entire population.

""Those neonatal savings may not be immediately visible without careful analysis, even though they are substantial,"" he said.

Additionally, Iriye and his colleagues are examining the performance and impact of the biomarker-guided screening strategy in other populations, including Medicaid-insured patients, who account for 40 to 45 percent of all deliveries in the US and who often have higher rates preterm births and downstream morbidity, he said.

""Evaluating how biomarker-guided screening performs in these settings is important for both equity and health system planning,"" he noted.

Army Veteran Ann Hoffman received her first mammogram out of necessity, not choice. When her husband, a Navy and Army National Guard Veteran, went on Medicare and Tricare for Life in 2010, his insurance required her to get a mammogram.

She was 53 at the time and had never received one. Like many, she assumed she didn’t need it. Nothing was wrong. She smoked, but no signs of cancer. No lumps. No symptoms. Nothing.

She surrendered for the betterment of insurance coverage… and in response to her husband’s and daughter’s pestering. Thinking it would be a quick, easy trip to the doctor’s office, the results showed she had breast cancer in two spots.

Hoffman had a lumpectomy, and a second surgery helped to increase the margins around the cancer spots in hopes of avoiding future issues.

The power of knowing

Although a scary diagnosis, Hoffman says she never actually felt she had cancer, which undoubtedly was impacted by not requiring chemotherapy or radiation for treatment. And, to top things off, another bonus was her newly found disgust for smoking.

“I’d smoked for 41 years, but we went out to breakfast shortly after my first surgery,” she shared. “As we walked in, a smoker had just put out a cigarette, and it made me nauseous. I never smoked again.”

Now 68, she continues to battle chronic health issues from chemical exposure while serving at Fort McClellan, Ala. But she’s been cancer and cigarette free for 14 years. She has one daughter and will celebrate her 40th wedding anniversary in February.

And she’s still getting that annual mammogram.

“I’m lucky they found cancer the first time because I probably would have never gone back for another mammogram, thinking I was right and didn’t need it. I never felt like I had cancer; I always felt everything was going to be fine, and it was, and still is. The only thing I have to do is get a mammogram annually, which I’m happy to do.”

TRICARE is more than just an insurance plan; it's a lifeline for those who have served our country and their families.
So, what does TRICARE cover?
First off, there are three main plans: TRICARE Prime, TRICARE Select, and TRICARE for Life.
For instance, if you're enrolled in TRICARE Prime—a managed care option—you'll likely enjoy lower out-of-pocket costs when using network providers.","Imagine standing at a crossroads, where the path to healthcare is lined with questions and uncertainties. For many military families and veterans, understanding what TRICARE covers can feel like navigating a maze without a map. But let’s break it down together.

TRICARE is more than just an insurance plan; it's a lifeline for those who have served our country and their families. It offers various coverage options tailored to meet diverse needs—whether you’re active duty, retired, or part of the National Guard or Reserve.

So, what does TRICARE cover? First off, there are three main plans: TRICARE Prime, TRICARE Select, and TRICARE for Life. Each has its own unique features but generally includes essential health services such as doctor visits, hospital stays, preventive care (like vaccinations), mental health support, and even some specialty care.

For instance, if you're enrolled in TRICARE Prime—a managed care option—you'll likely enjoy lower out-of-pocket costs when using network providers. This means that routine check-ups or specialist appointments could cost you significantly less compared to other plans. On the flip side, TRICARE Select gives you more flexibility in choosing your healthcare provider but may come with higher deductibles.

What about prescriptions? Well, TRICARE also provides robust pharmacy benefits through its formulary system—essentially a list of covered medications that ensures access to necessary drugs while keeping costs manageable. Whether it’s maintenance medication for chronic conditions or short-term prescriptions after surgery, you’ll find support here too.

But wait! There’s more! Did you know that certain types of therapy—like physical therapy following an injury—are also covered under specific circumstances? And if you're expecting little ones? Maternity care is included as well! From prenatal visits to delivery expenses—the peace of mind knowing these essentials are taken care of can be invaluable during such significant life events.

Now let's talk about dental and vision coverage because they often slip through the cracks when discussing overall health benefits. While basic dental services might not be fully covered under all plans (especially for adults), children typically receive comprehensive dental benefits up until age 21—and vision coverage varies by plan too!

Of course, it’s crucial to remember that each family situation is different; therefore reviewing your specific eligibility criteria based on factors like location or service history will help clarify any remaining doubts regarding what's available specifically for you.

In summary: TRICARE aims not only at providing medical assistance but fostering wellness among service members’ families across generations—a mission rooted deeply within our nation’s commitment towards those who protect us daily.",https://www.oreateai.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/a6p7qra6p7qra6p7.png,N,1.0,2026-01-07 21:12:12.511968
,,2026-01-07 23:19:01+00:00,Federal News Network - Helping feds meet their mission.,Bipartisan bill seeks to create joint DoD–VA credentialing system - Federal News Network,Anastasia Obis,,,,,https://federalnewsnetwork.com/congress/2026/01/bipartisan-bill-seeks-to-create-joint-dod-va-credentialing-system/,"Currently, the DoD and the VA rely on separate credentialing and privileging systems to approve their clinicians.
It would also require recommendations for scaling those systems with the goal of establishing a single, uniform credentialing and privileging system across both departments.
Under the bill, the Pentagon and the VA would have to jointly select a single credentialing and privileging system by January 2027 and notify Congress that the system is operational by 2028.
The DoD only recently streamlined its privileging process, which now allows medical providers to move between military treatment facilities with minimal administrative delays.
“Enterprise-wide privileging is just one of many efforts to make the Military Health System more agile.","A bipartisan group of lawmakers wants the Defense Department and the Department of Veterans Affairs to use a single credentialing and privileging system for medical providers, which would allow clinicians to move between DoD and VA facilities without having to go through months-long approval processes.

Currently, the DoD and the VA rely on separate credentialing and privileging systems to approve their clinicians. But those approvals don’t transfer between the two agencies, forcing providers who switch facilities to restart the approval process from the beginning. The process can take several months, during which clinicians are unable to see patients, which delays access to care and leaves facilities understaffed.

The legislation, introduced by Sens. Jacky Rosen (D-Nev.) and Marsha Blackburn (R-Tenn.), would require DoD and VA to provide Congress with a report on the medical provider credentialing and privileging systems they currently use. The report would assess what data each system stores, how portable provider’s credentialing and privileging information is, how interoperable the systems are and where gaps or limitations exist in their interoperability. It would also require recommendations for scaling those systems with the goal of establishing a single, uniform credentialing and privileging system across both departments.

Under the bill, the Pentagon and the VA would have to jointly select a single credentialing and privileging system by January 2027 and notify Congress that the system is operational by 2028.

“Health care providers shouldn’t be hindered by bureaucratic red tape when caring for the men and women who have bravely served our nation. Our bipartisan legislation would end unnecessary duplication so that medical providers can move between the DoD and VA more quickly, ensuring service members and veterans get the high-quality care they need without delay,” Blackburn said in a statement.

The credentialing process ensures that providers treating service members and veterans meet required qualifications. Meanwhile, privileging determines the medical services a provider can deliver based on their qualifications and experience.

Reps. Greg Murphy (R-N.C.) and Susie Lee (D-Nev.) introduced a companion bill in the House titled the “Department of Defense and Department of Veterans Affairs Medical Credentialing Integration Act of 2025.”

“This legislation is a strategic opportunity for the advancement of healthcare priorities throughout the federal sector healthcare system that strengthens workforce recruitment and retention, refines effective government health agency practices and provides for service members and veterans, all while safeguarding and better utilizing Americans’ hard-earned tax dollars,” Murphy said in a statement.

It is unclear what strategy the lawmakers plan to pursue — while it’s a bipartisan effort, standalone bills often face political hurdles, and lawmakers frequently try to attach such proposals to larger legislative packages like the annual National Defense Authorization Act to increase their chances.

The DoD only recently streamlined its privileging process, which now allows medical providers to move between military treatment facilities with minimal administrative delays.

As of October, providers no longer have to reapply for their clinical privileges when moving within the enterprise, including across stateside and overseas military hospitals and clinics.

“Health care providers should be able to focus on their patients. With portable privileges, they can do so more quickly,” Stephen Ferrara, acting assistant secretary of defense for health affairs, said in a statement. “Enterprise-wide privileging is just one of many efforts to make the Military Health System more agile. Previously, our health care providers renewed their privileges every two years. With this expanded policy, we have extended the renewal window to three years to reduce their administrative load.”

The Military Health System said the process of obtaining clinical privileges remains the same under the new policy.

Certain state veterans cemeteries across the country received a near total of $80 million in grants in fiscal 2025 for their improvement from the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs, officials recently announced.

The department granted 20 state veterans cemeteries over $77 million in fiscal 2025 for their improvement, expansion, reimbursements and the new establishment of one in Alaska, according to a VA statement released Dec. 30.

“Under President Trump, VA is committed to ensuring America’s Veterans cemeteries have the resources they need to provide excellent memorial benefits and services to our nation’s Veterans and their families, and these grants underscore that fact,” VA Secretary Doug Collins said in the release.

The cemeteries awarded grants include cemeteries in Arizona, Arkansas, Kansas, Kentucky, Massachusetts, Montana, New Mexico, North Carolina, Tennessee, South Carolina, Texas, Virginia and Wisconsin, as well as the establishment of the Interior Alaska Veterans Cemetery in Fairbanks.

VA’s National Cemetery Administration works to reimburse states for their state-run veterans cemeteries’ building, improvement or expansion costs.

The administered grants usually fund items such as improvements necessary for burials and operations and the construction of pre-placed crypts or columbaria, per the memo.

In fiscal 2025, more than 43,705 veterans and eligible family members were interred in VA grant-funded cemeteries, making up roughly 25% of the 174,705 total annual interments in all national and VA grant-funded veterans cemeteries.

The department has long strived to establish a veterans cemetery close to where almost every American veteran resides to improve burial options.

Currently, just under 94% of veterans nationwide have “reasonable access” to one, meaning about 77 million veterans live within 75 miles of a national, state or tribal veterans cemetery, according to the VA.

Since 2023, VA officials have set the goal to 95%, but the task requires a mix of federal and local funding as well as a commitment from regional leaders for preservation of the cemeteries.

The VA has awarded a total of over $1.1 billion in grants since 1980 to 124 veterans cemeteries in 47 states, 14 tribal nations and three territories, working in tandem with the VA’s 157 national cemeteries to provide more access for veterans.

The Reserve Advisory Council (RAC), a 12-member body representing both officers and enlisted Airmen across multiple career fields, partnered with the AFRC Congressional Affairs team and the Reserve Organization of America (ROA) to bring the “voice from the field” to Capitol Hill on Sept. 25. Together, with 20 additional Airmen from the National Capital Region, met with congressional staffers from the House of Representatives and Senate to share firsthand experiences from Reservists and advocate for the realities of today’s Citizen Airmen.

During “Hill Day,” members were divided into four teams accompanied by ROA and Congressional Affairs subject-matter experts and participated in 21 meetings with congressional staffers. Some topics under discussion included Inactive Duty Training (IDT) travel reimbursement policies for Reservists commuting long distances due to limited local unit availability; the extension of Tricare Reserve Select to Air Reserve Technicians, the Transition Assistance Program, and more.

“The Air Force Reserve Congressional Engagements Team provides Reserve-centric insight to Congress, helping lawmakers understand the Reserve’s unique capabilities and ensuring Air Force Reserve Command has the support and resources it needs to deliver combat-ready forces,” said Lt. Col. Zachary Roberts, Chief, Congressional Issues and Initiatives. “Thank you to the RAC and ROA teams for partnering with us to meet with the professional staff supporting key committees that play a pivotal role in the political process and in making ‘Hill Day’ a success.”

These interactions highlighted how open dialogue between Reservists and congressional staff helps shape a deeper understanding of the Reserve mission.

“We experienced a wide range of discussions with some conversations centered on listening to staffers and how they viewed defense-related topics and budget considerations, while others offered the opportunity to share personal experiences and highlight issues that matter directly to Reservists on the ground,” said Lt Col Jessica Greening, IMA to Director of Assignments, Air Reserve Personnel Center and outgoing RAC President. “The engagement is part of an ongoing effort to strengthen programs and support for Citizen Airmen. Improvement is a continual process, and our work as a council supports the natural evolution of programs, policies and regulations over time.”

The RAC is a professional development platform that empowers its members to help inform bipartisan legislative and policy recommendations focused on improving the quality of life for the Air Force Reserve. Past accomplishments include recognizing an enlisted educational board deficiency in coordination with the AFRC/CCC; the Council spearheaded the Enlisted Education Board Transformation by pioneering an ROE that expanded 40 percent of the board selection rate and advocated for more enlisted course opportunities for Airmen across the ARC.

Council membership is an additional duty and a three-year commitment, with new representatives rotating in and out annually. Each November and December, the Air Force Reserve opens its application window for Airmen interested in serving on the RAC and contributing to meaningful policy conversations and ensure Reservists’ perspectives are heard at the national level.",https://d1ldvf68ux039x.cloudfront.net/thumbs/photos/2601/9470354/1000w_q95.jpg,N,0.0,2026-01-07 15:56:35.574457

Eisenhower Army Medical Center, U.S. Senator Jon Ossoff today announced passage of a new provision in the NDAA to protect health care for military servicemembers.

Sen. Ossoff announced the passage of a key provisionThis is an external link in this year’s National Defense Authorization Act that will help protect health care by increasing oversight over the Department of Defense’s ability to modify or downsize military hospitals and clinics.

The provision will require the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff and Surgeon General of the relevant military department to review proposed changesThis is an external link to military treatment facilities to determine their impact on military readiness before changes can be made.

Additionally, the provision will require the Director of the Defense Health Agency (DHA) to explainThis is an external link how servicemembers, families, and retirees would receive medical care if hospital cuts would affect their typical access to health care.

The NDAA became law last month.

This comes after Sen. Ossoff launched an inquiry in November with the Acting Director of the Defense Health Agency (DHA) requesting more information about reported plans to reduce services at Eisenhower Army Medical Center, which serves between 30,000 to 40,000 active-duty servicemembers, retired servicemembers, their families, and DoD civilians in and around the CSRA.

In response to Sen. Ossoff’s inquiry, the Acting Director of the DHA told Sen. Ossoff, “It is premature for the DHA to address your detailed and thoughtful questions one by one.”

“Any potential reductions in care at Dwight D. Eisenhower Army Medical Center risks putting further strain on the Augusta Veterans Affairs Medical Center and surrounding hospitals in the region. This new provision will strengthen oversight to protect our servicemembers, their families, and veterans from potential hospital cuts that could risk their access to life-saving care,” Sen. Ossoff said.

The provision would have expanded TRICARE, the military’s health insurance program, to cover IVF services for service members and their families.
“Most people in the military are young, generally under 25, so the need for IVF is likely limited,” Tipton said.
“The military healthcare system should focus on catastrophic illnesses and essential needs,” Smith said.
“We anticipate the introduction of a freestanding bipartisan bill this month to provide these services for the military,” he said.","(The Center Square) – Illinois U.S. Sen. Tammy Duckworth, D-Schaumburg, criticizes the House speaker and the president after a provision expanding in-vitro fertilization coverage for military families was stripped from the defense bill. Opponents cite cost, capacity and ethical concerns.

Sean Tipton, chief advocacy and policy officer for the American Society for Reproductive Medicine, said Speaker Mike Johnson’s decision was rooted in ideology rather than fiscal realities.

“This provision passed in an overwhelming bipartisan way in both the House and the Senate,” said Tipton. “And the speaker just decided he was going to take it out. It’s undemocratic. It’s cruel to the military.”

Critics, including David Smith of the Illinois Family Institute, argue the federal government should not require taxpayers to fund IVF, which they view as an elective medical procedure.

“Taxpayers should not be funding this dubious medical procedure,” said Smith. “This is an elective medical treatment, and the government has no business expanding into that kind of care.”

In a video circulating on social media, Duckworth called on lawmakers to restore the provision.

“It should be a no-brainer that we pass IVF benefits for our military men and women and their families,” said Duckworth in the video. “The people who deserve IVF first and foremost are the men and women who go to war to defend us.”

Tipton said Duckworth’s experience as a wounded combat veteran and a mother who used IVF gives her firsthand understanding of how fertility care affects service members and military retention.

The provision would have expanded TRICARE, the military’s health insurance program, to cover IVF services for service members and their families. Tipton rejected claims that including IVF would “crowd out” other healthcare services, arguing that providing fertility care would not prevent the military from funding essential medical treatments for service members.

“I cannot follow the logic of that at all,” Tipton said. “That’s like saying if you treat a patient’s flu and don’t let them die from it, eventually you’re going to have to pay for the next disease they get. Any excuse is a lie other than his specific religious objections to reproductive healthcare. Providing healthcare for the military costs money. You can’t expect people to serve and then not get healthcare.”

Advocates of taxpayer-funded IVF projected the expansion would cost about $1.6 billion over 10 years, arguing it would be a relatively small investment to support military morale and retention.

“Most people in the military are young, generally under 25, so the need for IVF is likely limited,” Tipton said. “But for highly specialized personnel, such as fighter pilots, the military has invested significant time and resources in their training. Fertility benefits can be an important incentive for those service members to remain in the military.”

Some Republican lawmakers, including Congressmen Matt Rosendale of Montana and Josh Breechen of Oklahoma, however, have cited estimates closer to $1 billion per year.

Smith said taxpayer-funded IVF goes beyond the military’s essential responsibilities.

“The military healthcare system should focus on catastrophic illnesses and essential needs,” Smith said. “Not elective procedures that should be left to the private sector.”

TRICARE currently limits fertility coverage to service members whose infertility is a result of illness or injury sustained while on active duty.

Tipton said the debate is likely to continue.
