He previously pleaded guilty to a two-count information charging him with conspiracy to violate the Federal Anti-Kickback statute and conspiracy to commit health care fraud.
The leads consisted of information about Medicare and other beneficiaries and pre-written doctors’ orders for DME.
Authorities allege Foote paid bribes and kickbacks to telemedicine companies, which in turn paid bribes and kickbacks to doctors to obtain doctors’ orders for DME based on the leads.
“Foote then sold the signed doctors’ orders to others with whom he had kickback arrangements.","A Connecticut man has been sentenced to 30 months in prison for his role in a $7.8 million health care fraud and kickback scheme.

Jesse Foote, 60, of Fairfield faced sentencing on Wednesday in federal court in Newark, New Jersey, according to the U.S. Attorney’s Office.

He previously pleaded guilty to a two-count information charging him with conspiracy to violate the Federal Anti-Kickback statute and conspiracy to commit health care fraud.

Between December 2017 and March 2021, Foote conspired with overseas telemarking call centers, durable medical equipment suppliers, telemedicine companies and doctors to submit fraudulent claims to health care benefit programs like Medicare and TRICARE, federal officials said. The fraud was described by authorities as a “a circular scheme of kickbacks and bribes.”

Authorities said Foote controlled a marketing company through which he purchased patient “leads” from overseas telemarking companies. The leads consisted of information about Medicare and other beneficiaries and pre-written doctors’ orders for DME.

Officials said the call centers targeted Medicare beneficiaries and others with health insurance to persuade them to accept DME, including orthotic braces, whether they needed them or not. Authorities allege Foote paid bribes and kickbacks to telemedicine companies, which in turn paid bribes and kickbacks to doctors to obtain doctors’ orders for DME based on the leads.

“The doctors often approved the DME orders without having any contact with the beneficiary and without making a bona fide assessment that the DME was medically necessary,” the U.S. Attorney’s Office wrote. “Foote then sold the signed doctors’ orders to others with whom he had kickback arrangements. The doctors’ orders were ultimately submitted to DME suppliers, including DME suppliers controlled by Foote, which submitted fraudulent claims for reimbursement to health care benefit programs including Medicare, TRICARE, and private insurance companies.”

A total of more than $7.8 million worth of false and fraudulent claims were submitted to health care benefit programs through the scheme, officials said.

During his sentencing, Foote was ordered to serve three years of supervised release once he is released from prison and to pay about $7.8 million in restitution.",https://www.courant.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/court_gavel.jpg?w=640&h=373,N,-1.0,2025-12-21 09:56:19.272177

Rep. Vern Buchanan, a Republican from Florida known for advocating animal rights, has been a vocal proponent of this change.

This decision follows advancements in simulation technology that have rendered the practice obsolete. The prohibition on “live fire” training involving animals is part of this year’s annual defense bill, although certain forms of animal use for wartime training will still be permitted.

Rep. Vern Buchanan, a Republican from Florida known for advocating animal rights, has been a vocal proponent of this change. He lauded the decision as a significant step in alleviating unnecessary suffering in military training practices. “With today’s advanced simulation technology, we can prepare our medics for the battlefield while reducing harm to animals,” Buchanan stated. As Co-Chair of the Animal Protection Caucus, he expressed pride in leading efforts to eliminate traditional and inhumane training methods.

Despite this ban, the Defense Department will continue to permit various forms of training that involve inflicting trauma on animals. This includes operations that involve stabbing, burning, and blunt force, as well as the testing of weapons on live animals. While proponents of these practices assert that animals are anesthetized during such training and testing, animal rights groups argue that the use of animals in any form of trauma training should be discontinued altogether.

The Pentagon has deferred media inquiries regarding the new policy to the Defense Health Agency, which is responsible for overseeing training protocols. In response to the new ban, the agency indicated that it is reviewing the guidelines.

Advocacy groups, including People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals (PETA), have heralded the change as a victory for animal welfare. They claim it will spare thousands of animals from suffering and marks a transformative move towards more humane and relevant training technologies.

Historically, the military’s use of animals for trauma training has been questioned, with previous legislation aiming to curtail these practices. A Government Accountability Office (GAO) report indicated that the military had received mandates to transition toward human-based training methods. Specifically, a 2013 defense bill required the Pentagon to devise a strategy to reduce animal use, while a 2018 statute urged the maximum practical use of simulation technologies.

The GAO’s findings highlighted that while animals have been employed in medical training due to their biological similarities to humans, the effectiveness of using anesthetized pigs and goats has come under scrutiny. Critics, including the Physicians Committee for Responsible Medicine, argue that simulated training via “cut suits” worn by human actors provides a more accurate representation of battlefield wounds and conditions. Retired Navy doctor Erin Griffith emphasized the distinction, noting the critical difference in realism between caring for a living creature and responding to a wounded soldier requiring immediate intervention.

As the military moves forward with this revised policy, the focus remains on developing more humane and effective training methodologies that can better prepare medics for real combat scenarios.",https://news.ssbcrack.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/US-Military-Ends-Use-of-Live-Animals-for-Medic-Training.jpg,N,0.0,2025-12-20 15:56:20.089882

The Military CARE Act addresses access-to-care gaps by creating a secure, standardized digital platform for TRICARE beneficiaries to submit and monitor care issues, requiring real-time notifications to patient advocates, directing the Defense Health Agency to analyze complaint trends each quarter, and mandating annual reports to Congress that outline challenges and corrective actions.

“Our military families deserve timely care and a clear path to raise concerns when the system falls short. The Military CARE Act gives service members and their families a direct line to report care access issues and track their resolution, while ensuring Congress has the data needed to identify and fix systemic problems across the military health system,” Rep. Bacon said. “I’m pleased to co-lead this vital effort with Rep. Horsford to strengthen access to care for the families who sacrifice so much in service to our nation.”

“Military families serve our nation and sacrifice so much for it, and they deserve a health care system that serves them just as well,” Rep. Horsford said. “Too many families struggle to get timely appointments or clear information, and they’re left without a reliable way to raise concerns or track whether problems are fixed. This bipartisan bill gives military families a real voice, gives providers the tools to respond quickly, and gives Congress the oversight needed to ensure servicemembers and their loved ones are never left behind.When we support our families, we strengthen the entire force.”

“Access to timely, reliable health care is both a personal issue and a readiness issue. Too often, military families hit administrative roadblocks or long delays with no clear way to raise concerns or track whether problems are being fixed,” Rep. Houlahan said. “The Military CARE Act brings transparency and accountability to the system by giving TRICARE beneficiaries a straightforward way to report access issues and ensures those concerns reach patient advocates and senior leaders. This bipartisan, commonsense bill helps Congress identify systemic gaps and ensures our military health system works for the people it’s meant to serve.”

“Today, America’s servicemembers, veterans, and military families are forced to fight endless red tape and navigate a confusing and deeply frustrating system to get the healthcare they have earned,” Rep. Goodlander said. “That’s not right. Our commonsense bipartisan bill will cut senseless red tape, restore basic accountability, and return the power back where it belongs: with patients. This bill is about ensuring accountability, strengthening readiness, and keeping the sacred promise we make to those who serve our country.”

“Without reliable data and transparency, access-to-care problems in the military health system remain unseen and unresolved,” Lt. Gen. Brian Kelly, USAF (Ret), President and CEO, Military Officers Association of America said. “The Military CARE Act ensures beneficiary experiences are captured, tracked, and reported – giving leaders and Congress the visibility needed to identify systemic issues and drive meaningful, lasting improvements for military families. MOAA is grateful for the bipartisan leadership of Reps. Horsford, Kiggans, Bacon, and Houlahan in advancing this critical reform and MOAA priority.”

The bipartisan Military Care Act, co-led by Reps. Don Bacon (NE-02) Steven Horsford (NV-04), Jen Kiggans (VA-02), Chrissy Houlahan (PA-06) also includes the following original cosponsors: Reps. Sanford Bishop (GA-02), Maggie Goodlander (NH-02), Sarah McBride (DE-AL), and James Moylan (GU-AL).

The initiative was notably pushed forward by Congressman Vern Buchanan, a Republican from Florida, who has been a vocal advocate for animal rights. He described the decision as “a major step forward in reducing unnecessary suffering in military practices,” emphasizing that modern simulation techniques allow for effective preparation of medics without harming animals. Buchanan, serving as Co-Chair of the Animal Protection Caucus, expressed pride in contributing to efforts aimed at phasing out what he considers outdated and inhumane practices.

Despite this prohibition, Buchanan’s office noted that the Department of Defense will still permit training exercises that involve invasive procedures on animals, including stabbing and burning, as well as “weapon wounding,” which entails testing weaponry on animals. Animal rights advocates argue that animals used in these scenarios are typically administered anesthesia to minimize suffering.

The Defense Health Agency, responsible for overseeing medical training, affirmed its commitment to transitioning away from animal models while maintaining high standards of medical training. The establishment of a defense medical modeling and simulation office was highlighted as part of its ongoing efforts to provide realistic training scenarios for service members.

Organizations such as People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals (PETA) heralded this decision as a victory, claiming it will save thousands of animals each year and represents a progressive shift towards cutting-edge, human-relevant simulation technology.

While the exact frequency of animal use in military training remains unclear, there have been ongoing legislative efforts aimed at curtailing such practices. A 2022 Government Accountability Office (GAO) report indicated that previous defense bills have urged the military to adopt human-based training methods. The 2013 defense bill required the Pentagon to outline strategies for transitioning away from animal involvement in trauma training, while a 2018 law mandated that simulation technology be utilized as widely as possible, barring instances where animal use was deemed necessary by higher medical authorities.

The GAO report highlighted that live animals like pigs and goats were traditionally used in trauma training due to their anatomical similarities to humans, which provided needed realism in medical training situations. However, critics argue that these methods are inadequate in truly preparing medics for the realities of combat. The Physicians Committee for Responsible Medicine has stated that using anesthetized animals does not effectively simulate the experience medics face when treating injured soldiers. Erin Griffith, a retired Navy doctor and member of the committee, remarked that while the idea of caring for a living being may add a layer of realism, it does not capture the chaotic environment of real combat scenarios where injuries occur.

This unique partnership allows them to rotate through the Intensive Care Unit, Pediatric Intensive Care Unit, Operating Room, Respiratory Care Department, and Emergency Department, actively contributing to day-to-day healthcare delivery for TRICARE beneficiaries, while honing their expertise.” According to the Air Force Medical Service, the CCAT mission falls under Air Mobility Command. CCATT members are experienced in the care of critically ill or injured patients with multisystem trauma, head injuries, shock, burns, respiratory failure, multiple organ failure, and other life-threatening complications.

Some of the most common procedures and medications CCATT members administer in-flight include anti-blood clot medications, painkillers, and providing oxygen and ventilation.

The typical patient load for a standard CCATT is up to three critical patients, or up to six stabilized patients. The value of the CCATT was demonstrated last January, when a fireworks explosion on Oahu resulted in a mass casualty event with severely burned patients requiring advanced ventilatory support. PACAF CCATT, in collaboration with the U.S. Army Institute of Surgical Research Burn Team, successfully executed the first transport of six intubated patients in over two decades, onboard a C-17 Globemaster III, to a specialized burn center.

Maj. Broekelmann stated, “this mission highlighted the strategic value of having a highly trained, rapidly deployable critical care capability in the Indo-Pacific theater.”

The PACAF CCATT ensures the best possible chance of survival and recovery for those in dire need. In addition to fielding PACAF’s CCATT, 15 MDG supports the U.S. Air Force’s 15th Wing and operates a medical and dental clinic as part of Defense Health Network Indo-Pacific, delivering patient-centered and cost-effective outpatient health care for three wings and 65 geographically separated units across Joint Base Pearl Harbor-Hickam.",https://cdn.dvidshub.net/images/dvids_logo.svg,N,0.0,2025-12-20 11:56:30.442475

The frequency of animal use in military training has been somewhat ambiguous.

This decision, rooted in advancements in simulation technology, is part of the annual defense bill and reflects a broader shift towards more humane training methods.

The prohibition on “live fire” training involving animals has been supported by Rep. Vern Buchanan, a Republican from Florida known for his advocacy on animal rights issues. Buchanan characterized this policy change as a major advancement in alleviating unnecessary suffering within military training practices. He emphasized the potential of modern simulation technology to effectively prepare medics for battlefield scenarios without harming animals, stating, “With today’s advanced simulation technology, we can prepare our medics for the battlefield while reducing harm to animals.”

While the ban specifically targets the use of pigs and goats in live training exercises, the Defense Department will still allow some forms of animal involvement, including practices that may involve stabbing or burning, as well as weapon testing on animals. Animal rights organizations argue that these animals are meant to be anesthetized during such procedures.

The Pentagon has assigned commentary on this new policy to the Defense Health Agency, which oversees medical training and has indicated that it is reviewing the implications of this ban. Advocacy groups, including People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals (PETA), have hailed the decision as a victory, suggesting it will save thousands of animal lives each year and marks a substantial move towards utilizing more modern, humane simulation technology.

The frequency of animal use in military training has been somewhat ambiguous. Previous defense bills have attempted to curtail the dependency on live animals for trauma training. A 2022 report from the Government Accountability Office highlighted that earlier legislation has aimed at transitioning to human-based training methods. Earlier directives also required that the military use simulation technology “to the maximum extent practicable” unless animal use was sanctioned by the medical chain of command.

Historically, live animals like pigs and goats have been utilized in trauma training due to physiological similarities to humans, as their organs and tissues can offer valuable insights into medical treatment. Nevertheless, critics, including groups like the Physicians Committee for Responsible Medicine, argue that the use of anesthetized animals fails to accurately simulate real-life emergencies. They advocate for the use of “cut suits,” which can mimic actual human injuries and provide a more relevant training experience.

Erin Griffith, a retired Navy doctor and member of the Physicians Committee, articulated a critical perspective on the training methods, asserting that the inherent realism in caring for a living creature does not equate to the chaotic circumstances faced in combat situations. She underscored the vast differences between working with an unconscious animal and treating a wounded service member who is fully aware and responsive to their injury.

As the military turns towards updated training technologies, this shift potentially marks a turning point not only for combat medic training but also for the ethical considerations surrounding animal welfare in military practices.",https://news.ssbcrack.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/US-Military-Bans-Use-of-Animals-in-Trauma-Training-Amid.jpg,N,0.0,2025-12-20 01:56:27.126718

They struggle with #mentalhealth, they flirt with #suicide, they confront the juggernaut of the U.S. government in an aim to recoup the benefits and entitlements they were promised when they entered the service. There are no mass marches on Washington (yet), and no clashes with our currently-serving forces (except perhaps in the ideology arena), but the fight is just as real, and the reasons are eerily similar to those of our WWI veteran predecessors – a constant uphill fight for justice and the stinging sentiment of betrayal.
