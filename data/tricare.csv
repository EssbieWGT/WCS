FAIRFIELD, CT — Federal authorities have charged a 74-year-old Fairfield man, and a Florida man, in connection with an alleged scheme to fraudulently bill more than $500 million to Medicare, Medicaid, TRICARE, and private insurers for COVID-19 testing services that were never provided, prosecutors announced Thursday.

Fairfield resident Dr. Martin Perlin, and Cemhan ""Jimmy"" Biricik, 46, of Boca Raton, FL were charged with conspiracy to commit health care fraud and more than 50 counts of health care fraud, according to U.S. Attorney Jerome F. Gorgon Jr. in the Eastern District of Michigan.

Biricik, the CEO and sole member of New York-based Fast Lab Technologies, LLC, and Perlin, the company’s medical director, were arrested Thursday morning.

According to the indictment, during the COVID-19 pandemic, Fast Lab promoted free testing through its website, collecting insurance information from individuals who requested test kits. Prosecutors allege that the company then used that information to submit false claims for both antigen and PCR tests, including multiple claims for the same individuals.

The indictment states that Fast Lab falsely represented that tests were supervised by medical professionals, that saliva samples were collected and returned for analysis, and that lab testing was conducted. In most cases, prosecutors allege, tests were taken at home without supervision, saliva samples were never submitted, and no laboratory analysis occurred.

Perlin is accused of authorizing the tests despite having no treating relationship with the individuals. Authorities also allege that Fast Lab often submitted claims before the test kits were shipped.

Biricik is accused of billing or directing the billing of more than $500 million and receiving over $50 million in payments.

The investigation involves multiple federal agencies, including the Department of Health and Human Services Office of Inspector General, the FBI, the Department of Labor, the IRS, the Defense Criminal Investigative Service, and the U.S. Postal Inspection Service, among others.

Gorgon emphasized that both men are presumed innocent unless proven guilty. The case is being prosecuted by Assistant U.S. Attorneys Regina R. McCullough and Ryan A. Particka.

According to the settlement agreement and the complaint in partial intervention, Exposito and her company altered patients’ medical diagnoses to obtain prior authorizations on behalf of pharmacies, including PerforMix Specialty Pharmacy, a compounding pharmacy located in Amherst. This resulted in the submission of false claims to Medicare and TRICARE.

“Submitting false claims to federal health care programs like Medicare and TRICARE undermines the integrity of our health care system and diverts critical resources away from patients who need them,” said U.S. Attorney Jay McCormack. “Accountability in cases like this helps restore trust in our health care system and ensures taxpayer dollars are protected.”

“The submission of falsified prior authorization requests undermines an important safeguard against unnecessary Medicare costs,” said Special Agent in Charge Roberto Coviello of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, Office of Inspector General (HHS-OIG). “This settlement highlights HHS-OIG’s ongoing commitment to combatting fraud in the taxpayer-funded Medicare program, and we will continue to thoroughly pursue allegations of False Claims Act violations.”

The False Claims Act permits whistleblowers to file civil lawsuits alleging that false claims have been submitted to the United States. This FCA settlement resolves allegations against Georgina Exposito’s company originally brought in a lawsuit filed by a whistleblower. As part of the settlement the whistleblower will receive a portion of the settlement amount.

The claims resolved by the settlement are allegations only, and there has been no determination of liability. The United States’ case against the other defendants named in the complaint in partial intervention continues.

This case was investigated by the Office of Inspector General of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, the Office of Inspector General of the Department of Defense, and the Federal Bureau of Investigation. The case is being handled by Assistant U.S. Attorney Raphael Katz.

Gorgon Jr. announced today.

Cemhan “Jimmy” Biricik (age 46) of Boca Raton Florida, and Dr. Martin Perlin (age 74) of Fairfield, Connecticut were charged with conspiracy to commit health care fraud and more than 50 substantive counts of health care fraud. Biricik was the sole member and Chief Executive Officer of Fast Lab Technologies, LLC (Fast Lab). Dr. Perlin was Fast Lab’s Medical Director and provider responsible for ordering the majority of the tests. Both defendants were arrested this morning.

According to the Indictment, during the Covid-19 pandemic, New York-based Fast Lab operated a website offering “free” covid tests. When individuals went to the website to order tests, they were asked to provide their insurance information. Fast Lab then used this insurance information to fraudulently bill Medicare, Medicaid, TRICARE and numerous private insurances for both antigen (“rapid”) and PCR (“laboratory) tests, across multiple dates for each beneficiary. Specifically, Fast Lab’s claims represented that (1) the antigen tests had been observed by medical professionals, (2) saliva samples were collected by medical professionals, and (3) PCR testing was performed on those samples. In reality, the vast majority of antigen tests—if taken at all—were taken at home and not observed by medical professionals; saliva samples were never collected nor returned to Fast Lab; and PCR testing was never performed. Dr. Perlin was the ordering physician for these tests, despite not having a treating relationship with the beneficiaries. Further, Fast Lab would regularly submit insurance claims before the test kits were even delivered to the beneficiaries. In total, Biricik billed or caused to be billed more than $500 million in claims and was paid more than $50 million.

“National Guard and Reserve members have different TRICARE coverage options when they transition between active and inactive status,” said Brian Smith, senior health system specialist, TRICARE Health Plan, at the Defense Health Agency. “TRICARE encourages you to review your health coverage options to ensure you maintain continuous health coverage. Do this prior to coming on active duty orders for more than 30 days and deactivating.”

What are my TRICARE options when I activate?

You get the same health care benefits as active duty service members when you’re activated for more than 30 days on qualifying orders. Your service updates your TRICARE eligibility in the Defense Enrollment Eligibility Reporting System. Your service does this each time your duty status changes.

Did you receive delayed effective-date, active duty orders for more than 30 days in support of a contingency operation or under 12304b? Then you get early TRICARE eligibility up to 180 days from the date your active duty begins. Do you want more information? Visit TRICARE Pre-Activation Benefits.

Here are things to consider:

• Your TRICARE health plan. You’ll be automatically enrolled in TRICARE Prime as an active duty service member. You’ll have an unassigned primary care manager. This means you can see any TRICARE-authorized provider. You’ll follow your command’s guidance on any additional enrollment requirements when you arrive to your final duty station. The following TRICARE Prime health plans may be an option:

o TRICARE Prime

o TRICARE Prime Remote

o TRICARE Prime Overseas

o TRICARE Prime Remote Overseas

• Your family gets coverage, too. Eligible family members may enroll in a TRICARE health plan. This depends on where they live at the time of your activation. They must act and enroll in one of these health plans within 90 days of your activation.

o TRICARE Prime

o TRICARE Prime Remote

o TRICARE Prime Overseas

o TRICARE Prime Remote Overseas

o TRICARE Select

o TRICARE Select Overseas

o US Family Health Plan

o TRICARE Young Adult

• Dental coverage changes. Did you have TRICARE Dental Program coverage prior to activation? You’ll be automatically enrolled in the Active Duty Dental Program. This is described in the TRICARE Active Duty Dental Program Brochure. Your enrolled family members keep their TDP coverage with lower premiums. Family members who aren’t enrolled can join anytime.

Are you wondering how to get care while activated for more than 30 days? Do you have TRICARE Prime?

• You can get routine, urgent, and emergency care from a military hospital or clinic or a civilian TRICARE-authorized provider.

• Referrals and pre-authorizations are required for specialty care.

Do your family members have TRICARE Select coverage?

• They can get care from any TRICARE-authorized provider.

• They can get care at a military hospital or clinic if space is available.

• They don’t need referrals in most situations. They may need pre-authorizations for some health care services.

Do you live and work more than 50 miles from a military hospital or clinic? Your family members may enroll in TRICARE Prime Remote. You can check to see if you’re in a remote location—use the TRICARE Plan Finder. Your family members get most of their care from a TRICARE-authorized provider with TRICARE Prime Remote.

What about line of duty care?

Line of duty care is limited to ailments incurred or aggravated during a period of qualified duty 30 days or less. This includes injuries sustained while traveling to and from and staying overnight at a duty station. Your unit is responsible for initiating an LOD determination request.

LOD isn’t a government lifetime health plan. It’s a special eligibility status to treat a specific condition for up to one year. The process for getting LOD care depends on where you’re located. Check out Line of Duty Care for Service Members to learn more.

How about when I deactivate?

Once your active duty period ends, your TRICARE coverage options depend on the type of orders you were under.

Were your active duty orders more than 30 days in support of a contingency operation or under 12304b? If so, you’d be eligible for Transitional Assistance Management Program coverage for 180 days. You and your eligible family members are covered as active duty family members. Your TRICARE health plan options depend on where you live with TAMP coverage. TRICARE Prime Remote isn’t available during TAMP. You must act and submit your new enrollment request within 90 days from your last date on active duty. If you fail to do so, you’ll only be eligible for coverage at a military hospital or clinic.

After TAMP coverage ends, or if you weren’t eligible for TAMP and your active duty period ends, you may have options. You may buy TRICARE Reserve Select coverage if you qualify. Or you may be eligible for Continued Health Care Benefit Program coverage. You may also seek health care insurance through your state’s Health Insurance Marketplace.

You maintain TRICARE pharmacy benefits during TAMP or other TRICARE health plan options.

Is there dental coverage after deactivation?

• Active duty dental benefits continue during TAMP.

• Your TDP coverage and premiums return to regular rates when TAMP or other TRICARE coverage ends.

• Your family members’ TDP coverage continues without interruption.

Do I get retirement coverage?

You may keep TRICARE coverage after retirement. This is if you complete 20 qualifying years of service.

Are you retiring from the National Guard or Reserve? Are you under age 60? You may buy TRICARE Retired Reserve if you qualify. TRICARE Retired Reserve is a premium-based health plan. For more information, visit TRICARE Retired Reserve.

Have you turned age 60 and are drawing retirement pay? You may enroll in TRICARE Prime or TRICARE Select.

Are you under age 60 and drawing retirement pay due to active duty segments? You aren’t eligible to enroll in TRICARE Prime. You may buy or continue coverage under TRICARE Retired Reserve.

Want to make sure your family keeps their health coverage during these transitions? Review all your TRICARE options. You can contact your regional contractor with any questions. You can also visit the TRICARE website to learn more.",https://d1ldvf68ux039x.cloudfront.net/thumbs/photos/2507/9230217/1000w_q95.jpg,N,0.0,2025-07-31 15:56:14.079622

The Armed Forces Wellness Center headquarters team, which is part of Defense Health Agency-Public Health located in Aberdeen, Maryland, achieved a major milestone with the American Medical Association’s approval of a new Current Procedural Terminology code for air displacement plethysmography, which is a body composition analysis method used across the DHA health promotion enterprise.

This new code, which goes into effect in January 2026, enables standardized reporting of whole-body composition assessments, offering AFWCs a higher level of precision in evaluating services provided to military hospital or clinic beneficiaries.

“The addition of this code allows for greater granularity and more refined measurement of readiness-focused health promotion activities across the Military Health System,” said Michael Jarka, AFWC health promotion program manager.

The approval will increase transparency between the primary care teams and health promotion/AFWC teams, said Joanna Ward-Brown, AFWC operations project officer. Previously this service was being provided by either the AFWC or medical clinic but not captured in the electronic medical record as there was no code for body composition assessment via air displacement technology.

“This means that AFWCs and other military hospitals and clinics around the world can accurately capture body composition assessments using Bod Pod air displacement technology,” said Ward-Brown. “Accurately depicting services offered through the military hospital or clinic in the electronic medical record is critical and is a requirement for the Joint Commission, which certifies healthcare organizations across the U.S.”

For the first time, DHA can clinically track this capability through coded encounters, enhancing visibility of preventive services and performance optimization efforts, said Jarka.

“Previously, these data were captured inconsistently or excluded from clinical metrics entirely,” he said.

The new code allows AFWCs to capture the whole picture of the individual; specifically, it allows the entire care team to ensure service members are maintaining a healthy body composition and preventing diseases associated with obesity. The code increases efficiencies and ensures the warfighter’s health is being addressed holistically, said Ward-Brown.

To get approval, Ward-Brown submitted an application request to the AMA CPT Editorial Panel, which then reviewed it at their May 2025 meeting in New York. The panel accepted only 36 of the 80 applications reviewed during the meeting.

According to the AMA, the CPT Editorial Panel, a body appointed by the AMA board of trustees, is responsible for maintaining and updating the CPT code set, which is used to report medical services and procedures. The panel ensures the CPT codes reflect the latest medical care available. The process involves several steps, including submitting applications, review by AMA staff and CPT advisors, and final decision-making by the panel.

“It’s a very rigorous process—about 800 doctors attend that meeting,” said Ward-Brown. “The panel advisors become the ‘shepherds’ of my application and represent me before the panel at the AMA CPT editorial panel meeting. I was also given the opportunity to present my case and answer questions.”

After all questions/concerns have been addressed, the panel then votes, and results are posted on the AMA website a few weeks following the meeting, said Ward-Brown. She subsequently received the panel’s approval letter.

“One thing this accomplishment shows is that DHA assets have good partnerships with outside agencies,” said Ward-Brown.

The AFWC team plans to distribute the code across the enterprise in January 2026 as part of their implementation plan.

As of June 9, all referrals are now processed through the TriWest Patient Portal, giving patients faster access to authorizations and the freedom to select their own provider.

Sabrina Cobb, BJACH’s chief of managed care, said the change is part of a broader shift to expand options, shorten wait times and improve patient outcomes.

“Patients now have the flexibility to choose a network provider that works best for them based on availability and travel distance,” Cobb said. “If that provider is more than 100 miles away, they’ll need to follow the TRICARE Prime Travel Reimbursement guidelines, which help cover reasonable travel costs when specialty care isn’t available closer to home.”

The new system eliminates the traditional wait for referral letters to arrive by mail. Patients are now encouraged to log into the TriWest portal to review their referral, choose a provider and schedule their appointment directly.

Greater choice, greater responsibility

The TriWest Patient Portal puts care in patients’ hands. Once logged in, patients can view and download approved referrals, see assigned providers and contact them directly, select a different network provider if desired, and begin the appointment process immediately.

“Patients no longer need to wait for a phone call or letter,” Cobb said. “They can take immediate action by logging in, reviewing the referral and calling to schedule their initial visit.”

The portal also includes provider contact information, office locations and a growing directory of participating specialists. TriWest is actively expanding its network to better meet patient needs.

Encouraging proactive care

This change, now in effect across the entire TRICARE West Region, reflects a growing emphasis on patient-centered care and personal responsibility in navigating the healthcare system.

“We encourage our patients to be involved in their healthcare, including treatment plans, setting goals with their provider, scheduling follow-ups and using available tools to improve outcomes,” Cobb said.

Patients who are proactive about their referrals often experience shorter wait times and better continuity of care.

Support when you need it

While the process is now patient-driven, BJACH’s managed care team remains available to support beneficiaries who have questions or concerns.

“We’re available Monday through Friday, 8 a.m. to 4:30 p.m.,” Cobb said. “We can help patients understand the referral process and direct them to the right resources.”

BJACH’s Beneficiary Counseling and Assistance Coordinator (BCAC) is also available to assist with eligibility, enrollment, claims and billing questions related to TRICARE.

In addition to support from the hospital, the TriWest Patient Portal includes a range of educational tools to help patients confidently navigate the system. Resources are available for selecting providers, making payments, booking appointments and understanding referral details.

Know before you go

Cobb also emphasized that referrals issued before June 30 during a temporary waiver period are valid through Sept. 30. Referrals issued after June 9 must be accessed through the TriWest Patient Portal.

We will continue to innovate, improve our processes, and refine our approach to deliver the best medical capabilities available to the Joint Force.
For example, just this Spring, we participated in two Joint Force, international, U.S.-led exercises in the Philippines and Lithuania.
Moreover, we can and do routinely support the urgent needs of the Joint Force, up to and including the medical team that supports the Executive Branch.
COL Roberts: This is indeed a challenging world – we see it every day and at every turn.","U.S. Army Col. Owen L. Roberts assumed leadership of the newly established Operational Medical Systems Program Management Office in early 2025. As part of the Defense Health Agency, OPMED acts as the Department of Defense’s leading force in medical development and acquisition, working to enhance Warfighter lethality and readiness. The project managers on his team develop and deliver next-generation, world-class medical capabilities that empower combatant commanders for Large-Scale Combat Operations, especially in austere environments. Their mission focuses on two key objectives: saving lives on the battlefield and quickly returning injured service members to duty.

As the DoD’s medical community prepares for the 2025 Military Health System Research Symposium next week in Kissimmee, Florida – MHSRS is the DoD’s premier scientific meeting focused on Warfighter medical readiness, performance, expeditionary medicine, and return to duty – Roberts shared his insights into the dynamic capabilities OPMED brings to the table, how their mission is evolving, and what his team is doing to support the U.S. Joint Force.

Changes are rapidly occurring across the DoD. How is the OPMED team managing these changes while continuing its mission to support Warfighters?

COL Roberts: We operate in a very dynamic environment, and we continue to evolve to better meet the needs of leadership within the Department of Defense and our partners in the Joint Force. That said, our focus and our mission haven't changed: we remain the DoD’s premier medical development and acquisition experts, laser-focused on supporting the medics, corpsmen, and medical officers in the Army, Navy, Air Force, and special forces.

Whether we're managing a product, device, treatment, or project, each begins at a different point in the development process.

However, our ultimate aim remains constant: to provide our military end users with the vital tools they need to save lives during Large-Scale Combat Operations and return injured service members to duty.

These priorities are what we focus on, as individuals and as a team, because it is what the American people expect from military medical providers. We will continue to innovate, improve our processes, and refine our approach to deliver the best medical capabilities available to the Joint Force. In the end, it’s all about improving Warfighter readiness and honing Warfighter lethality for tomorrow’s wars.

What are some of the core focus areas for OPMED as we head toward 2026 and beyond?

COL Roberts: First, we are working to streamline and improve the processes that directly support the medics and medical officers at the front lines. For OPMED, that means making some tough choices to better apply our resources toward projects that address a current capability gap and are most beneficial to end users in a time- and resource-constrained environment.

Second, we continue to focus on Warfighter readiness and lethality. Our project management portfolios – blood products, brain health, expeditionary medicine, rapid diagnostics, and force health protection, to name a few – are all tailored to meet the needs of medical providers at and near the front lines. Our goal is to develop, acquire, and field the tools that improve readiness at the operational level and increase lethality at the tactical level – as rapidly and cost-effectively as possible.

We are mindful that 2026 (and, for that matter, the years to come) is not a finish line, but a benchmark. The key to our success is to continuously develop the devices, treatments, and capabilities that will meet the needs of the DoD and the military medical community.

How is OPMED expanding its scope to meet the needs of that broader DoD medical community?

COL Roberts: That’s a great question, and the answer is twofold.

One, we have a much wider aperture now that we have realigned to the Defense Health Agency. Our stakeholders are no longer primarily within one service, as was the case when we existed as part of the Department of the Army. OPMED’s projects and portfolios must be necessarily broad to meet the needs of the individual services, but also tailored to meet the specific needs of medical providers at the front lines, regardless of the color of their uniforms. It is a new challenge, but one that we are particularly well-suited for, given the reach we have within the DoD.

Two, we are very proactive in our outreach, while remaining flexible and responsive to urgent needs. For example, just this Spring, we participated in two Joint Force, international, U.S.-led exercises in the Philippines and Lithuania. We met with and supported key stakeholders in the INDOPACOM and EUCOM combatant commands during Balikatan 25 and DEFENDER 25, respectively. These were premier events that both raised awareness of our mission and gave us a much better understanding of the challenges end users face in tactical, austere environments. Moreover, we can and do routinely support the urgent needs of the Joint Force, up to and including the medical team that supports the Executive Branch.

Why is it important to have a medical development organization like OPMED, especially given the DoD’s focus on Large-Scale Combat Operations in austere environments?

COL Roberts: I ask myself that question frequently, and the answer drives my mission mindset: OPMED is the avenue for generational advancement within the U.S. military medical community – and we cannot, and will not, fail in that mission.

The projects we manage for the DoD are designed for worldwide use tomorrow, and for at least a few generations to come. From beachheads in the Indo-Pacific to military treatment facilities in the United States, the capabilities we are developing now will someday be in the hands of medics who haven’t even been born yet in 2025.

We take that responsibility seriously, because we don’t know what the future holds – but we will work tirelessly to make sure our partners in the Joint Force are as prepared as possible for the next war, wherever and whenever it happens.

How do you and the OPMED team measure success?

COL Roberts: This comes down to our priorities: Driving innovation in the medical development space; rapidly developing medical solutions for service members; enabling Warfighter readiness and increasing lethality; and managing proactive partnerships inside the DoD and with industry to deliver functional and fieldable technologies and treatments as quickly as possible.

We measure our success by meeting those objectives on a daily, monthly, and quarterly basis, because that is what our Warfighters need and what the American people deserve: medical solutions that not only save lives but also enhance the DoD’s ability to fight and win anywhere in the world.

What are some of the challenges on the horizon, and how is OPMED working to mitigate them?

COL Roberts: This is indeed a challenging world – we see it every day and at every turn. The U.S. is center stage in addressing regional conflicts across several combatant command areas of responsibility in real time. The challenge that OPMED faces, as the DoD’s premier medical development organization, is to increase the speed of delivery while outpacing the technological innovations of our adversaries. We do not have the luxury of embarking on projects that take a decade – the threat environment is evolving far too rapidly for old paradigms.

We address these challenges every day in very deliberate ways. First, we are conducting an expedited and thorough review and assessment of the high-impact programs that meet the immediate needs of Warfighters: blood replacement, oxygen delivery, and combat trauma treatment, to name a few. These lifesaving capabilities are the highest priority for frontline medics and medical organizations at Role 1 (field treatment) and Role 2 (forward support) levels of care.

Second, we are developing stronger ties with end users across the Joint Force to focus on efforts that will yield the greatest return on investment in the shortest time possible. Our project managers routinely meet and engage with the stakeholders who rely on our development expertise. They, in turn, provide invaluable feedback to help our teams refine their processes and quicken the pace of development. It’s all about reaching milestones, securing FDA approvals, and transitioning new products for fielding to make the biggest impact.

Third, we remain acutely aware of conflicts happening across the globe. The DoD has worldwide reach and influence, and at literally any moment, American Soldiers, Sailors, Airmen, and Marines can be called to action, anywhere around the world. At OPMED, our core mission is to develop medical solutions that are functional and fieldable today, in support of our Warfighters. And the team we have in place is ready to deliver.",https://cdn.dvidshub.net/images/dvids_logo.svg,N,0.0,2025-07-31 11:56:13.528807

Is your student hitting the books at college this fall? For many eligible young adult military dependents, US Family Health Plan coverage can continue while they’re away at school. Typically, military dependents are eligible for TRICARE® benefits until their 21st birthday. If your dependent is enrolled full-time in an accredited college, coverage can extend up to their 23rd birthday or graduation, whichever comes first.

How to extend coverage past age 21

Request proof of full-time enrollment from the college registrar’s office, showing your dependent is working toward an associate degree or higher. Submit this documentation to DEERS.

Update your dependent’s DEERS information before their 21st birthday to avoid automatic disenrollment. Find instructions on updating DEERS information here.

After updating DEERS, call Member Services at 1-888-674-8734 (TTY: 711) to confirm the extension of coverage.

Getting care while away at school

Your dependent can still access care while away at college, even if outside of our network.

Urgent or emergency care: Covered anywhere, anytime. If your dependent received urgent or emergency care while out of the area, coverage applies. Be sure to notify Member Services afterward.

Point of service (POS) option: For routine or specialty care outside the network, coverage is still available under the POS option with higher out-of-pocket costs. See martinspoint.org/pos for more information about the POS benefit and your cost shares.

Transferring TRICARE coverage: If your dependent is living outside the service area long term, it may be helpful to transfer (“port”) their coverage to another TRICARE contractor. Call Member Services to review options.

Not a full-time student? There’s still coverage

If your dependent is between the ages of 21 and 26 and not enrolled full time in college, they may qualify for the TRICARE Young Adult (TYA) program. TYA is a premium-based plan available through Martin’s Point US Family Health Plan. TYA offers the same medical and pharmacy benefits as the TRICARE Prime plan you’re used to; however, your dependent becomes their own sponsor and pays a monthly premium.

To qualify for TYA

Be unmarried and under age 26

Be registered in DEERS and eligible for TRICARE benefits

Not be eligible for other employer-sponsored or military health coverage

If you’re considering TYA, call Member Services at 1-888-674-8734 to learn more about premiums, the application process, and what to expect.

The City of Lacey's Commission on Equity meeting on July 28, 2025, highlighted significant challenges faced by veterans and their families in navigating post-military life. Key discussions focused on the complexities of systems like VA and TRICARE, which many veterans find difficult to understand, leading to unmet behavioral health needs and basic necessities such as housing, jobs, and food.

Participants noted that the transition from military to civilian life can be particularly challenging, especially for those discharged before the implementation of the Transition Assistance Program (TAP) in 2018. This program was designed to prepare service members for civilian life, but its effectiveness varies widely among individuals. Some veterans reported that the program did not meet their needs, particularly for those in higher ranks who felt the resources were geared toward lower enlisted personnel.

The meeting also addressed the unique struggles faced by spouses and immigrant family members of active-duty military personnel. With service members often away for extended periods, spouses may struggle to access necessary resources, compounding their challenges, especially for those new to the country.

A notable point raised was the importance of integrating civilian experiences into the TAP program. Veterans who transitioned successfully into civilian roles emphasized the need for private sector involvement in the program to provide realistic insights into the job market.

Despite the mandatory nature of the TAP program, some veterans remain reluctant to participate, which can lead to further difficulties in their adjustment. The Commission underscored the need for ongoing support and encouragement for veterans and their families to engage with available resources.

Overall, the discussions at the meeting reflect a growing recognition of the complexities surrounding veteran transitions and the need for comprehensive support systems to address these challenges effectively. The Commission on Equity aims to advocate for improved resources and programs to better serve this population in Lacey and beyond.

The Office of Personnel Management is encouraging agencies to offer more skills-building opportunities to their employees. Several upskilling options already exist in government, like OPM’s rotational program for the cyber workforce. But OPM says agencies can do more to help employees take advantage of those options. Creating opportunities for feds to learn skills outside their day jobs can also pay off immensely. “It’s also about keeping employees fresh and engaged, and it can be a very sharp tool for morale, retention and even attracting talent in the first place,” said Jeff Bardwell, OPM’s acting director of strategic workforce planning, and senior advisor for HR workforce programs.

DoD Chief Information Officer Katie Arrington said last week that DoD has been conducting forensic investigations and holding daily calls with Microsoft since the vulnerability was publicly disclosed. The attacks have already compromised more than 400 organizations worldwide and impacted several government agencies, including the Departments of Energy, Homeland Security and Health and Human Services.

A top official in charge of the federal government's real estate portfolio is stepping down. Michael Peters, commissioner of the Public Buildings Service at the General Services Administration is leaving the agency. Peters recently told staff that PBS would begin an agency reorganization next week. Peters joined GSA at the start of the Trump administration and set a goal of cutting the amount of federal real estate in half. PBS planned to cut 63% of its total workforce and has already laid off entire regional offices. This is the second major GSA leadership shakeup in as many weeks. Michael Rigas, the deputy secretary of state for management and resources, took over as acting GSA administrator last week.

The Trump administration is reminding agencies of its authority over all Schedule G hires. The Office of Personnel Management says the White House will have to approve any of those hires agencies want to make. That requirement mirrors the process for Schedule C, which is also reserved for recruiting political appointees. The new Schedule G hiring authority broadens agencies’ options for hiring non-career feds, beyond the existing Schedule C category. The Trump administration says the existing Schedule C authority left a gap in agencies’ ability to fill policy-making and policy-advocating roles.

The Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency is out with new guidance to help agencies stop hackers in their tracks. CISA’s new zero trust guidance focuses on how agencies can microsegment their networks. The goal is to ensure hackers and malware can’t spread far beyond a breached device or account. The guidance is part of a new series CISA is producing called the “journey to zero trust.” Much of the document is non-technical and focuses on how management can embrace microsegmentation. The concept brings better cybersecurity, but requires careful planning to avoid disrupting the network and users.

New legislation that’s moving quickly in Congress would require the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency to release a major report on security gaps in U.S. telecommunications networks. Oregon Senator Ron Wyden’s bill requiring the report’s release within 30 days unanimously passed the Senate on Tuesday. Wyden has been pressing CISA for years to release the unclassified report “U.S. Telecommunications Insecurity 2022.” But the agency has refused. Wyden is currently holding up the nomination of Sean Plankey to be CISA director until the agency agrees to release the document. Wyden says it contains vital and shocking information about threats to U.S. phone systems.

A bipartisan group of congressional lawmakers are pushing to eliminate TRICARE premiums for dependents under age 26. Congressional lawmakers want to bring TRICARE in line with most civilian health insurance plans by allowing military dependents to remain on their parents’ coverage until age 26 without paying additional premiums. If passed, the Health Care Fairness for Military Families Act would align TRICARE eligibility with the Affordable Care Act, which requires most civilian insurance plans to cover dependents until they turn 26 at no extra cost. Under current TRICARE rules, dependents are only covered until age 21, or 23 if they are full-time students.

Small Business Administration head Kelly Loeffler is putting federal contracting officers on notice about fraud and waste in the 8(a) small business contracting program. In a letter to all agencies, she's reminding all federal contracting officers that it’s their responsibility to report possible fraud or abuse of the socioeconomic program. Loeffler says contracting officers must ensure “that federal awards go to legitimate, eligible small businesses,” and must report potential misconduct, including entities that knowingly submit false information, conceal disqualifying facts or other abuse.” This letter comes after Loeffler ordered a full scale audit of the 8(a) program earlier this month. The audit is in response to the Justice Department’s findings of a years-long fraud and bribery scheme involving a former federal contracting officer and two 8(a) contractors.

Please be reminded that balance billing TRICARE beneficiaries is prohibited under the TRICARE West Region.

What is Balance Billing?

Balance billing occurs when a provider bills a TRICARE beneficiary for any amount exceeding the TRICARE-allowable charge after TRICARE has processed the claim.

A provider seeking any payment from a beneficiary, other than the applicable deductible and cost-sharing amounts for TRICARE/CHAMPUS-covered services may be in violation of federal billing regulations.

Noncompliance may impact your TRICARE and/or Medicare status. Balance billing requirements apply to both network and non-network providers who treat TRICARE beneficiaries. Both network and non-network providers are encouraged to explore all available options to resolve claims issues.

For more information, visit the TRICARE Balance Billing and Collection Activities section of the Provider Handbook.

(July 30, 2025)– Alexander T. Augusta Military Medical Center (ATAMMC) continues to demonstrate its unwavering commitment to military families through its Child and Adolescent Partial Hospitalization (CAPH) Program, a vital initiative that provides comprehensive mental health care for TRICARE-eligible adolescents between the ages of 12 and 18.

For nearly 30 years, CAPH has delivered evidence-based, day-treatment mental health services in a structured, therapeutic setting, serving as a lifeline for military-connected youth facing depression, anxiety, ADHD, Autism Level I, and parent-child relational issues. By combining medical excellence with compassion and community integration, the program helps young patients stabilize and thrive without the disruption of inpatient hospitalization.

“Military families live with resilience, adaptability, and service at their core. However, the demands of military life, including frequent relocations, deployments, and reintegration stress, can significantly impact adolescent mental health,” said Dr. Kasi Patterson, Service Chief of the CAPH and Child & Adolescent Embedded Behavioral Health Program. “Traditional outpatient care may not provide the intensity or consistency needed to support these youth, while inpatient hospitalization may be too disruptive. The CAPH bridges the gap in care by offering a high-intensity, family-centered alternative.”

Purpose-Driven and Accessible

Operating Monday through Friday from 7:30 a.m. to 3:00 p.m. (with early dismissal at noon on Thursdays), the CAPH offers a full day of structured programming, combining individual, group, and family therapy with therapeutic community activities tailored to meet the unique needs of each participant. Patients return home each evening, preserving essential family and school connections.

Located on the 1st floor (Sunrise Entrance) of ATAMMC, the program is open to families enrolled in both TRICARE Prime and TRICARE Standard, and there are no co-pays for military beneficiaries, including those of retired service members. For families traveling from out-of-state or overseas, the Fisher House offers free lodging, ensuring accessibility to care without added logistical or financial burden.

A Holistic, Therapeutic Environment

The CAPH program is based on the principles of therapeutic community and social systems theory, empowering patients to take responsibility in a supportive environment that encourages emotional growth, resilience, and reintegration. An interdisciplinary care team, including psychiatrists, psychologists, nurses, social workers, and behavioral health technicians, collaboratively supports each patient’s recovery journey.

Beyond clinical care, CAPH also plays a vital role in training the next generation of military behavioral health professionals, serving as a teaching site for psychiatry residents and fellows.

World-Class Care for a Deserving Population

As one of the few programs of its kind within the Military Health System, ATAMMC’s CAPH continues to set the standard for adolescent mental health care across the Department of Defense.

“The program’s design allows youth to receive intensive, individualized treatment while staying connected to their family, school, and military community,” added Dr. Patterson. “It’s not just about healing, it’s about restoring confidence, relationships, and readiness at every level.”

WHAT’S THE IMPACT The Arkansas law would have barred companies that own PBMs from also holding a pharmacy license.
PBMs act as third-party administrators of prescription drug programs for commercial health plans, self-insured employer plans, Medicare Part D plans and state government employee plans.
They ostensibly are tasked with maintaining the formulary, contracting with pharmacies, negotiating discounts and rebates with drug manufacturers, and processing and paying prescription drug claims.
The American Medical Association released data last September showing that the four largest pharmacy benefit managers in the country control roughly 70% of the national market.","A federal judge has struck down a new law in Arkansas that would have banned pharmacy benefit managers from owning or operating pharmacies in the state.

In the decision, U.S. District Judge Brian Miller granted a preliminary injunction preventing the law from taking effect, saying that it may violate the U.S. Constitution's Commerce Clause. He said the law is also likely preempted by TRICARE, a healthcare program serving military members and their families.

Specifically, Miller found that the law emphasized protecting locally operated pharmacies over those affiliated with PBMs, thereby undermining its constitutionality, and said it interferes with national contracts for prescription drug services.

WHAT’S THE IMPACT

The Arkansas law would have barred companies that own PBMs from also holding a pharmacy license. It had been set to take effect Aug. 5, but CVS and Express Scripts sued over the law's implementation. The Associated Press reported that Republican Attorney General Tim Griffin planned to appeal the court's decision.

PBMs act as third-party administrators of prescription drug programs for commercial health plans, self-insured employer plans, Medicare Part D plans and state government employee plans. They ostensibly are tasked with maintaining the formulary, contracting with pharmacies, negotiating discounts and rebates with drug manufacturers, and processing and paying prescription drug claims.

But the nation's three largest PBMs – CVS Caremark, Express Scripts and OptumRx – are owned by companies that operate their own pharmacy chains, which prompted Arkansas Governor Sarah Huckabee Sanders to sign the PBM bill into law. Independent pharmacies have complained that PBMs operated by larger conglomerates abuse their leverage to benefit their own pharmacy businesses.

Miller shot down several arguments from the PBM plaintiffs but said they were likely to succeed on their claims related to the Commercial Clause, which limits the power of states to interfere with interstate commerce.

THE LARGER TREND

The ""Big 3"" pharmacy benefit managers – CVS Caremark, Express Scripts and OptumRx – mark up specialty drugs at their affiliated pharmacies by hundreds or even thousands of percent, according to a January staff report from the Federal Trade Commission.

Such significant markups allowed the largest three PBMs and their affiliated specialty pharmacies to generate more than $7.3 billion in revenue from dispensing drugs in excess of the drugs' estimated acquisition costs from 2017 to 2022, the report found.

These PBMs netted significant revenue at a time when patient, employer and other healthcare plans sponsor payments for drugs steadily increased on an annual basis, the FTC said.

The findings build on a report issued by FTC staff in July 2024 that found that pharmacies affiliated with the Big 3 PBMs received 68% of the dispensing revenue generated by specialty drugs in 2023, up from 54% in 2016.

The American Medical Association released data last September showing that the four largest pharmacy benefit managers in the country control roughly 70% of the national market.

The analysis, based on 2022 data on commercial and Medicare Part D prescription drug plan (PDP) enrollees, also found a high prevalence of vertical integration of PBMs with health insurance companies.

CVS Health is the largest PBM (with a 21.3% market share), followed by OptumRx (20.8%), Express Scripts (17.1%) and Prime Therapeutics (10.3%).",http://www.healthcarefinancenews.com/sites/hfn/files/2025-07/pills_docs_pharmacy_RUNSTUDIO_Getty%20Images.jpg,N,0.0,2025-07-30 14:56:36.227377

READ: Indian American couple establish endowed chair at Texas University (July 24, 2025) Dr. Prasad’s resignation from the FDA marks a significant moment in ongoing debates about the agency’s role, transparency, and scientific rigor.
Known for his outspoken critiques of FDA practices, Prasad consistently emphasized the need for stronger evidence and higher standards in drug approvals to protect patient safety.
Despite his brief tenure, Prasad’s influence extends beyond the FDA through his advocacy for evidence-based medicine and calls for reform in healthcare regulation.
The support he received from FDA Commissioner Makary underscores his respected scientific standing, even amid controversy.","An outspoken critic of the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA), Dr. Vinay Prasad has resigned from the organization amid drug-related controversy. Prasad stepped down following a series of controversial decisions related to a treatment for boys with Duchenne muscular dystrophy, according to Stat News.

“Dr. Prasad did not want to be a distraction to the great work of the FDA in the Trump administration and has decided to return to California and spend more time with his family,” a spokesperson for the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services told CNN on Tuesday.

CNN reports that according to a person familiar with the matter who was granted anonymity to describe the internal dynamics, Prasad’s departure came amid fresh pressure from the White House for him to resign, and followed days of criticism from Laura Loomer, a right-wing activist with extraordinary access to President Donald Trump.

Prasad had been defended by FDA Commissioner Dr. Marty Makary just days ago; in an interview with Politico, Makary said Prasad is an “impeccable scientist … one of the greatest scientific minds of our generation.”

Dr. Vinay Prasad is a prominent hematologist-oncologist and health policy researcher known for his critical analysis of medical research, FDA drug approvals, and healthcare practices. He emphasizes the importance of rigorous evidence and transparency in the approval and use of new treatments, often highlighting cases where FDA decisions have been influenced by limited or low-quality data.

Prasad advocates for stronger standards in clinical trials and challenges the overuse of costly or unproven therapies in medicine. Through his writings, podcasts, and social media presence, he has become a respected voice in promoting evidence-based medicine and improving regulatory processes. While he is not affiliated with the FDA as an official member, his critiques and insights often target FDA policies, aiming to encourage reforms that better protect patients and improve healthcare outcomes.

Dr. Prasad’s resignation from the FDA marks a significant moment in ongoing debates about the agency’s role, transparency, and scientific rigor. Known for his outspoken critiques of FDA practices, Prasad consistently emphasized the need for stronger evidence and higher standards in drug approvals to protect patient safety. His departure, reportedly influenced by political pressures and public criticism, highlights the complex intersection of science, policy, and politics within regulatory bodies.

Despite his brief tenure, Prasad’s influence extends beyond the FDA through his advocacy for evidence-based medicine and calls for reform in healthcare regulation. The support he received from FDA Commissioner Makary underscores his respected scientific standing, even amid controversy.",https://americanbazaaronline.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/FDA.png,N,0.0,2025-07-30 12:56:13.161946

Check your DEERS record The first step is to check your DEERS record.
Update your DEERS record If you need to update or correct your DEERS record, do so immediately.
Maintain your DEERS record Throughout the year, you may experience changes that require you to update your DEERS record.
You can do this by making sure that every time you have a qualifying life event, you update your DEERS information.","JULY 30, 2025 – When was the last time you looked to see if your information in the Defense Enrollment Eligibility Reporting System is up to date? If it’s been a while, it’s extremely important to take time and log in to DEERS to review or update your information.

DEERS is key to managing military health benefits, supporting the needs of service members, retirees, and their family members. You should make sure to update your information in DEERS so your family can get the benefits they deserve.

The Defense Manpower Data Center operates DEERS. DEERS contains confidential information about the eligibility of service members, retirees, and their family members for benefit and privilege programs administered by the Department of Defense and the uniformed services. It shows if you and your family members are eligible for and enrolled in TRICARE benefits.

But the Defense Health Agency doesn’t administer DEERS—DMDC does. This means you’re responsible for keeping your DEERS information up to date. You should check your DEERS record on the milConnect website at least once every three months to make sure your family’s information is accurate. If you see anything that’s incorrect, get it fixed right away.

In addition to updating your own DEERS record, your service personnel office will sometimes update your DEERS record following important life events, like retirement. So, you should check your DEERS record often—even if you haven’t recently made updates yourself—to ensure it’s correct.

If your DEERS record is incorrect or outdated, it could lead to:

Delays in accessing health care, filing claims, and getting prescriptions

An inability for TRICARE to contact you about your health coverage

Unexpected bills for health care

Disenrollment from your TRICARE plan

Want to ensure this doesn’t happen to your family? Follow these steps to find and maintain your information in DEERS.

1. Check your DEERS record

The first step is to check your DEERS record. You can do this on the milConnect website. What are some things to check? As described in the TRICARE Qualifying Life Events Fact Sheet, your DEERS record lists your:

Service status

Family status

TRICARE coverage status and plan

Contact information, including phone number, mailing address, and email address

You should also review the information for each family member and confirm your personnel, service, and eligibility status are accurate.

Keep in mind, each family member must be registered in DEERS before they can have TRICARE coverage. If you’re a sponsor, you’re automatically registered in DEERS, but you must register your eligible family members.

2. Update your DEERS record

If you need to update or correct your DEERS record, do so immediately. Sponsors and family members can update their contact information. Your contact information includes your phone number, mailing address, and email address. Here are your options for updating your contact information in DEERS:

Online: Log in to the milConnect website

Phone: 800-538-9552 (TTY/TDD: 866-363-2883)

Mail:

DMDC/DEERS Support Office

Attention: COA

400 Gigling Road

Seaside, CA 93955-6771

Fax: 800-336-4416

If you need to add or remove family members, sponsors must do this in person promptly by going to their nearest ID card office. Only sponsors can add or remove family members. Call or check online for your ID card office’s operating hours and to make an appointment. Don’t forget to bring supporting documents, such as a birth certificate, marriage certificate, or divorce decree.

3. Maintain your DEERS record

Throughout the year, you may experience changes that require you to update your DEERS record. So, the third step is to continue to update your information as soon as a change occurs. You can do this by making sure that every time you have a qualifying life event, you update your DEERS information.

A QLE “unlocks” a 90-day period for you to make changes to your plan. Common examples of QLEs include:

Retiring or separating from active duty

Getting married

Giving birth or adopting

Moving

Becoming eligible for Medicare

Gaining or losing other health insurance

Following these steps will help you avoid any break in your TRICARE coverage. Unlock your health by going to DEERS to learn more.",https://www.militaryspot.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/240813-O-D0202-1001.png,N,0.0,2025-07-30 12:56:35.945820

Getting civilian care through a TRICARE contractor

Here’s a look at each.

DEERS and milConnect/Beneficiary Web Enrollment

DEERS is the foundation of TRICARE eligibility. The milConnect website lets you update contact information, check your enrollment status, and access Beneficiary Web Enrollment tools. You can use this platform to:

Enroll in or change TRICARE plans

Update contact information, like your address or phone number

milConnect now uses myAuth, a new user-friendly secure login that is gradually replacing DS Logon. Keep reading to learn more about myAuth.

MHS GENESIS Patient Portal

If you get care at a military hospital or clinic, the MHS GENESIS Patient Portal is your main access point. You can:

View laboratory results

Request prescription refills

Make appointments

Send secure messages

You may also view your health records and appointment notes from military hospitals and clinics.

Regional contractor portals

Health care outside of military hospitals and clinics is administered by TRICARE contractors. Each has its own portal:

TRICARE East Region: Humana Military

TRICARE West Region: TriWest Healthcare Alliance

TRICARE Overseas: International SOS

TRICARE For Life (in all regions): WPS Military and Veterans Health

Use these portals to:

View claims

Check referrals

Find network providers

Pharmacy login

Express Scripts is the TRICARE Pharmacy Program contractor. Through their portal, you can switch eligible medications to TRICARE Pharmacy Home Delivery and:

Request new prescriptions

Refill prescriptions

Track your order status

Pay bills

Dental login

Are you enrolled in the TRICARE Dental Program? If so, United Concordia is your TRICARE dental contractor. Your United Concordia TDP My Account lets you:

View plan coverage details

Check claims history

View your dental explanation of benefits

Pay bills

What is myAuth?

myAuth is a new secure login option replacing DS Logon across Department of Defense systems. With myAuth, you can use your Common Access Card or a username/password, plus a secure multi-factor authentication method. This lets you access multiple DOD websites with just one login.

Currently, myAuth is used on:

milConnect

ID Card Office Online

Over time, all DOD systems that use DS Logon will transition to myAuth. Until then, platforms may use either DS Logon or myAuth depending on their system. (Note: You must have an active DS Logon account to create a new myAuth account.)

Civilian health portals

If you see a civilian provider, your provider may use an electronic health record, or EHR, other than MHS GENESIS. The DOD doesn’t own these other EHRs. You’ll need to follow your provider’s instructions to sign in and view records or communicate with providers.

Bottom line

Managing your TRICARE benefit means knowing which login to use—and when. While it may seem complex, here’s a breakdown:

Use milConnect for enrollment and DEERS updates.

Use MHS GENESIS to see your records for care at military hospitals and clinics.

Use your TRICARE contractor’s portal to manage claims, view referrals, and pay bills.

When in doubt, visit TRICARE All Logins page to find the right access point.

Remember: myAuth is coming, bringing with it a more unified login experience. Until then, save the portals you use most, keep your passwords safe, and check back for updates as the rollout continues.",https://media.defense.gov/2025/Jul/24/2003763468/1920/1080/0/250724-O-D0202-1001.PNG,N,0.0,2025-07-30 12:57:07.628411

He is one of the best doctors I have ever had in my life – a perfect combination of being knowledgeable about kidney transplant and health.
Thank you to the entire Nephrology team!” A Heartwarming Reunion Several months after her life-saving transplant, Higginbotham received another heartwarming surprise.","Tripler Army Medical Center — A U.S. Marine Corps spouse is thriving today because of a life-saving 2024 kidney transplant and collaboration between Walter Reed National Military Medical Center and Tripler Army Medical Center. The seamless coordination between the two military treatment facilities, spanning from Hawaii to Maryland, highlights a commitment to comprehensive care for military families and demonstrates the power of collaboration within the Military Health System.

Initial Diagnosis and Challenges

After moving to Oahu following a permanent change of station, Catherine Higginbotham sought iron supplementation due to concerns about fatigue, swelling and anemia. However, a routine checkup at TAMC revealed a diagnosis of kidney disease in July 2023.

Reviewing her records with her doctor, Higginbotham learned that the kidney disease likely began in 2013, following a bacterial pneumonia contracted years prior while stationed at Camp Pendleton. “I didn’t know the bacterial pneumonia was the cause of the acute kidney injury,” Higginbotham said. “Looking back at my health records showed me exactly when the kidney disease began.”

Dr. Myungjin Kim, a nephrologist at TAMC, diagnosed Higginbotham with Stage 5 kidney disease and recommended she be added to a transplant list in July 2023. After being informed of an eight -to-nine year wait list at a local Hawaii hospital due to her blood type, Higginbotham sought evaluation at Walter Reed National Military Medical Center. She then returned to TAMC for further assessment to confirm her candidacy for a transplant at WRNMMC.

Higginbotham underwent a comprehensive series of tests to assess her suitability and minimize potential complications. These included blood tests to evaluate overall health, kidney function, and blood type compatibility, as well as screening for immune system antibodies that could cause rejection of a donor kidney. Evaluations of heart and lung health were also conducted, along with a general health assessment to determine her overall fitness for the procedure.

“The good news was that I was perfectly healthy except for my kidneys. That was reassuring,” Higginbotham said. “What I learned is that I had to approach the process step by step. I broke it up into manageable parts, focusing on each appointment as it came.”

Fortunately, as Dr. Kim transitioned to WRNMMC, she connected Higginbotham with Dr. Christopher Middleman, a nephrologist who was simultaneously transferring from WRNMMC to TAMC. This seamless handover ensured continuity of care during the doctors’ moves.

After testing and health assessments confirmed her eligibility, Higginbotham was placed on the active kidney transplant waitlist. Concerned about her lack of nearby family support on the island, she took a friend’s advice and posted in a social media group that supports active-duty service members, retirees and service members’ families.

A Social Media Connection

“I woke up in the middle of the night, sobbing, overwhelmed and scared for my kids,” Higginbotham said. “I was on the bedroom floor crying when I heard my friend’s name, Michelle, come into my mind.” Remembering Michelle’s advice prompted her to grab her iPad and post in the group on Sept. 20 about her kidney failure, saying she needed a kidney donor.

Megan Boyd, a U.S. Marine Corps military spouse in Virginia, quickly responded to Higginbotham’s post just two days later, offering to be tested as a potential kidney donor. Boyd underwent testing at WRNMMC on Sept. 22 to determine if she was a potential kidney donor for Higginbotham.

A Perfect Match and a Successful Transplant

“Every single step, it was perfect. It was completely aligned. There was no hesitation,” Higginbotham said. “Just everything matched so well. Walter Reed was systematic in their transplant center. That transplant center should be world renowned. That’s how wonderful it is. They are caring, extremely organized, and empathetic. They have a wonderful team that works together.”

Testing confirmed that Higginbotham and Boyd were a perfect match for a kidney transplant. The transplant was quickly scheduled. Higginbotham described her experience at WRNMMC as calm and reassuring, saying she and Boyd felt well cared for.

The kidney transplant took place on Mar. 28 and was deemed a success. Higginbotham said she was able to briefly meet Boyd the day after the transplant surgery. Boyd knocked on Higginbotham’s door. “The minute she came in and I saw her, it’s a moment I will never forget for the rest of my life,” Higginbotham said. “I hugged her, and she hugged me. What do you say to someone who has saved your life? All I could say was thank you.”

Initial Recovery and Return to Hawaii

Following her kidney transplant, Higginbotham spent two months in Bethesda, Maryland, receiving ongoing care with frequent visits between the Navy Lodge and WRNMMC. She consistently expressed profound gratitude for the dedication and support of the WRNMMC nursing staff, who played a vital role in her recovery. Higginbotham also acknowledged the unwavering support of her family, emphasizing their crucial role throughout the entire process. “The surprising thing was how much better I felt immediately following the surgery,” Higginbotham said. “Before I went into surgery, my kidney function was at seven percent. And now it’s almost at 80 percent.”

Higginbotham returned to Hawaii on Mother’s Day in May 2024 and began post-transplant care with the Nephrology department at TAMC.

Long-Term Care at Tripler and Dr. Middleman’s Role

Kidney transplant recipients face a lengthy recovery process involving a strict medication schedule and regular monitoring to prevent organ rejection and manage side effects. Patients typically take immunosuppressant drugs for life, requiring frequent blood tests to adjust dosages and monitor kidney function. Achieving milestones – such as stable blood pressure, normal lab values, and a gradual return to activity – is crucial. Long-term care also includes vigilant monitoring for infections, as immunosuppressants weaken the immune system, and lifestyle adjustments to promote overall health and protect the transplanted kidney.

Dr. Christopher Middleman continued to oversee Higginbotham’s care upon her return to TAMC, ensuring a seamless transition and providing consistent monitoring and support. Higginbotham credits his dedication to her positive progress and peace of mind. “I wanted to express my gratitude to Dr. Middleman,” Higginbotham said. “I wasn’t scared to come back home, because I knew he would be there waiting. He is one of the best doctors I have ever had in my life – a perfect combination of being knowledgeable about kidney transplant and health. He also has the rare capability of caring for his patients. It’s a combination of listening to you because he cares about you. He is wonderful. Thank you to the entire Nephrology team!”

A Heartwarming Reunion

Several months after her life-saving transplant, Higginbotham received another heartwarming surprise. Boyd’s Marine Corps family received permanent change of station orders to the island, bringing the two women together once more. “When I found out Megan was moving to Hawaii, I was overjoyed,” Higginbotham said. “It felt like a gift on top of a gift.”

A strong bond quickly formed between the two military spouses, blossoming into a wonderful and lasting friendship between Higginbotham and Boyd. They now regularly enjoy coffee and long conversations, and Higginbotham considers Boyd more than just her donor. She is a cherished friend and forever part of her family. “Megan and her family have become an integral part of our lives,” Higginbotham said. “I am eternally grateful for her selfless act, and I cherish the friendship we’ve built. I never felt afraid and had a sense of peace going through the transplant. This experience has been a constant reminder of the incredible power of human connection, kindness, and God’s grace in our lives even during times of challenge.”

After that, military families have the option to enroll their children in the TRICARE Young Adult program, which can cost anywhere from $337 to $727 per month.
“If civilians can keep their family members on their healthcare coverage until age 26, it’s just wrong that military family members are treated differently.
According to Kelly, this legislation could save an estimated 350,000 military families approximately $8,724 per year in healthcare costs.
“Military families who rely on TRICARE for health care coverage should be treated the same as their civilian counterparts.","A bipartisan group of congressional lawmakers wants to bring TRICARE in line with most civilian health insurance plans by allowing military dependents to remain on their parents’ coverage until age 26 without paying additional premiums.

The legislation, dubbed the “Health Care Fairness for Military Families Act,” aims to align TRICARE eligibility with the Affordable Care Act (ACA), which requires most civilian insurance plans to cover dependents until they turn 26 at no extra cost. The bill has bipartisan support in both the House and the Senate.

Under current TRICARE rules, dependents are only covered until age 21, or 23 if they are full-time students who receive more than half of their financial support from their parents. After that, military families have the option to enroll their children in the TRICARE Young Adult program, which can cost anywhere from $337 to $727 per month.

Nearly 33,000 families are currently paying those monthly premiums, according to Sen. Mark Kelly (D-Ariz.), one of the bill’s sponsors.

“If civilians can keep their family members on their healthcare coverage until age 26, it’s just wrong that military family members are treated differently. This common-sense fix will raise the age limit, allowing military dependents to stay on their parent’s insurance plan until 26, the same age as civilians, without a premium increase,” Sen. Lisa Murkowski (R-Alaska), the bill’s co-sponsor, said in a statement.

According to Kelly, this legislation could save an estimated 350,000 military families approximately $8,724 per year in healthcare costs.

Since TRICARE is a federal healthcare program, it was exempt from parts of the Affordable Care Act, including the rule requiring coverage for dependents until age 26 at no additional cost.

To close that gap, Congress created the TRICARE Young Adult program in 2011, allowing military families to continue covering their adult children up to age 26 but specified that the program had to cover its own costs, requiring families to pay monthly premiums based on commercial insurance rates and coverage.

TRICARE Young Adult costs have skyrocketed over the last decade. In 2015, the monthly premium was $208. By 2020, it had climbed to $376 — an 81% increase in just five years. TYA prime now costs $727 per month per each dependent, representing a 250% increase since 2015.

“Military families who rely on TRICARE for health care coverage should be treated the same as their civilian counterparts. By providing coverage for military dependents until age 26, the Health Care Fairness for Military Families Act will lower healthcare costs for military families and establish equity between TRICARE and private plans,” Rye Barcott, co-founder and CEO of With Honor, said in a statement.

The bill was previously introduced in both 2021 and 2023. In 2021, the Congressional Budget Office estimated the legislation would cost about $125 million annually.

The bill now has more than 35 bipartisan co-sponsors in the House and is backed by more than 20 organizations, including Blue Star Families, National Military Family Association, Military Officers Association of America, National Guard Association of the United States, Iraq and Afghanistan Veterans Association, Tragedy Assistance Program for Survivors, the American Legion, and Wounded Warrior Project.

According to the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, young adults are the most uninsured age group and have the lowest rate of access to employer-based insurance, as many work part-time or entry-level jobs that don’t offer health benefits.

6 Key Features of the Federal EHR Unified health records consolidate patient data from multiple legacy systems.","Today, in a healthcare facility in North Chicago, Ill., a clinician is making decisions about the treatment she’ll provide to a U.S. military veteran. A year or two ago, she would have had to navigate between multiple electronic health record systems and paperwork her patient had on file, but now she has to click on only one EHR to access the patient’s entire clinical history, allowing her to make the best healthcare decisions.

The technology responsible for that progress: the Federal Electronic Health Record system. Developed jointly by the Department of Defense, Department of Veterans Affairs and Federal Electronic Health Record Modernization (FEHRM) Office, the software is now used by more than 200,000 clinicians in healthcare facilities across the world.

To learn more about the Federal EHR’s ongoing deployment, FedTech met with three leaders behind the effort: Dr. Neil Evans, acting program executive director of VA’s Electronic Health Record Modernization Integration Office; Dr. Yvette Weber, program executive officer for Defense Healthcare Management Systems; and Bill Tinston, FEHRM director.

Click the banner below to dive into CDW's latest cloud research.

FEDTECH: Mr. Tinston, the FEHRM unites and supports federal EHR deployment efforts across DOD and VA, as well as the U.S. Coast Guard and National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. Can you talk a little about the purpose of this technology and why it’s so important to these agencies?

TINSTON: The Federal EHR shows what agencies can do when they work together. Having a single record for the patient creates opportunities for providers to integrate, become more efficient and deliver better healthcare.

It’s technology based on commercially available software — a networked-based solution that allows us to almost instantly promulgate changes and innovations. The beginning of the pandemic was a great example. Physicians had to order COVID tests, and at the few sites where the Federal EHR had already been deployed, this ordering capability was added to the Federal EHR and physicians could order the tests in a matter of hours. In places where they were still using legacy systems, it took weeks to make the same change.

FEDTECH: In early 2024, DOD and VA completed the first joint deployment of the Federal EHR when the system went live at the Captain James A. Lovell Federal Health Care Center in North Chicago. Dr. Weber, with more than 3,500 DOD locations now using this technology — what the Military Health System calls MHS GENESIS — would you describe the rollout as a success?

WEBER: Absolutely. For DOD, success is ultimately defined by how the system enhances the quality of healthcare for our service members, their families, retirees and veterans. With full deployment, patients have experienced significantly improved access to their medical records, and clinicians are better able to coordinate care with comprehensive views of their patients’ medical treatment histories. Paper records that need to be transported to new duty stations will no longer be generated.

From an implementation perspective, we successfully transitioned, on time and within budget, from many separate legacy systems to a single, unified platform. And our success at Lovell FHCC, which is the largest DOD-VA joint facility, really shows the system’s interoperability in how it’s seamlessly connecting patient care from the point of enlistment all the way into and through veteran status.

FEDTECH: Dr. Evans, can you share where VA is at with deployment across its various facilities? And how is the rollout impacting veterans?

EVANS: As of now, the system is live at six VA medical centers and 26 associated clinics. It’s also in use at more than 100 remote sites, including our regional telehealth hubs. We’re currently working on accelerating our deployments across the rest of the enterprise, with plans for 13 new medical centers and many additional clinics to go live with the system in 2026.

From our point of view, this is exciting technology, but not just for technology’s sake. The comprehensive enterprisewide Federal EHR, and the associated health information technologies that integrate with it, power the modern healthcare system and put the “care” into healthcare. It’s a tool that gives providers access to the data they need in the moment to deliver the best and highest quality healthcare to the veteran or service member sitting in front of them.

A cloud-based architecture will feature low-latency, high-performance computing resources that will enable rapid access to patient data.”

Dr. Yvette Weber Program Executive Officer, Defense Healthcare Management Systems

FEDTECH: While the Federal EHR currently resides in a data center that is part of the infrastructure provided by Oracle Health, you’re working with vendors to move the system to the cloud. Can you talk about how this migration is going and the benefits you hope to realize from a cloud-based system?

WEBER: We’re moving to the cloud in phases to make sure we don’t impact the performance of the system. The vendor has planned for a multiyear migration effort, and this includes not just Oracle Health products but more than a hundred pieces of software that integrate with different platforms. We’re really focused on being disciplined — ensuring that we safeguard data with strict cyber protocols, for example — while also moving as fast as we can.

As far as the potential advantages go, a cloud-based architecture will feature low-latency, high-performance computing resources that will enable rapid access to patient data. We’ll have enhanced security measures that are inherent to the cloud, including FedRAMP High authorizations and a defense-in-depth approach to protecting sensitive patient information. And for IT teams, the cloud offers automation tools to simplify management and routine tasks such as scaling and patching.

EVANS: I would reiterate everything Dr. Weber said. We’re all excited about moving to the cloud, and we recognize the value that is going to be realized as part of that effort. I do want to highlight, though, the value that we’re getting from our current solution already. When it comes to the Federal EHR, regardless of how we’re running it — from a data center or in the cloud— what is more important is that it’s a single, integrated system. That’s a major step forward.

Click the banner below for the latest federal IT and cybersecurity insights.

FEDTECH: DOD is now focused on deploying specialized versions of MHS GENESIS to active-duty locations to improve healthcare for military personnel in the field. These are often extremely remote sites with limited connectivity. How might success in this area pay dividends for other Federal EHR users in the future?

TINSTON: These capabilities that DOD is deploying, to meet DOD needs, have the potential to support healthcare for Americans across the board, including at smaller agencies. Both the U.S. Coast Guard and NOAA have ships, for example, with people on board who may need care. Or, think about rural areas or unexpected natural or manmade disasters. The ability to present and capture data about a patient encounter in a poorly connected environment is clearly critical for the military, but it could also be useful in any situation where we don’t have the connectivity that we’re accustomed to. This is again why we do things together, and what makes this work so exciting.

6 Key Features of the Federal EHR

Unified health records consolidate patient data from multiple legacy systems.

Enhanced data sharing facilitates data exchange between agencies and with outside health care providers.

Improved, integrated clinical decision-support tools inform patient care.

A patient portal allows patients to access personal health records.

Population health management tools provide data and analytics solutions support for large-scale health initiatives.

Flexible deployment capabilities enable use in connected and unconnected environments.

Currently, TRICARE dependents can remain on their parents’ insurance policy until they are 21 years old without extra fees, 23 if they are a full-time student.

But keeping a dependent on TRICARE until they are 26 — the standard for civilians with private insurance — comes with a separate monthly premium.

The TRICARE Young Adult Program costs between $337 and $727 a month, according to a press release from Sen. Mark Kelly, D-Ariz., one of the bill sponsors.

The Health Care Fairness for Military Families Act would extend TRICARE coverage for active-duty and retired dependents up to 26 years old without paying an additional premium.

“As a Navy combat veteran, I know firsthand the sacrifices military families make,” Kelly said. “They’ve earned access to the same high-quality health care that American families expect. That’s why we’re fixing this gap in TRICARE coverage, so young adult children in military families aren’t left behind.”

Sens. Lisa Murkowski, R-Alaska, and Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., are also original sponsors of the Senate bill.

Reps. Jen Kiggans, R-Va., and Pat Ryan, D-N.Y., introduced the bill in the House.

“The fact that [military families are] forced to pay hundreds of dollars a month to keep their young adult children on TRICARE — while civilians can keep theirs covered at no cost until age 26 — is simply unfair,” said Kiggans, a Navy veteran.

“I’m proud to support this bipartisan legislation to fix that. Our military families deserve the same peace of mind as every other American family — especially when it comes to health care,” she added.

The bill was previously introduced in 2021 and 2023.

The legislation is endorsed by several veteran and military service organizations, including NGAUS, which counts it among its top priorities zero-cost health care for every member of the National Guard.

The National Guard Bureau estimates that 16% of Guard Soldiers and or Airmen have no medical coverage yet are subject to no-notice callups for duty.

It sounds like they perceived your market as saturated with professionals similar to you, they feel they don’t need your specialty much, or your credentials are wrong in their system.

Regardless of any if that, the goal of Tricare is to keep their payouts well below Medicare. The powers that be believe that is important and part of the reason they rarely will pay the maximum. Providers and services members complained years ago this would disincentivize qualified professionals from accepting Tricare. Tricare and our congress disagreed that would happen and to this day this still refuse to see it.

Edit: Autocorrect grammar errors.

Did you receive a copy of the EOB for the patients? The patient has a $32 deductible? Or a $32 co-pay? I think we would need more information on patient demographics (Active Duty, Active Duty Spouse/Dependent, Retiree or dependents, TYA (Tricare Young Adult), Prime or Select). There are a bunch of different combinations, so it's hard to tell just by this post. You can go onto tricare and look yourself up as a provider. They have a space to look up in network providers and out of network providers. Maybe start there and see if you are listed on either of those.

Hopefully someone else will chime in and help you out.

Not a provider. I’ve seen the drastic underpayments for pretty much all of the services my family receives since TriWest has taken over for several providers.

I would contact my state’s department of insurance and at a minimum file a complaint.

My personal theories are: (1) customers will be forced to come out of pocket to continue services because TriWest won’t fully cover costs or (2) every single provider will drop Tricare and everyone will be absolutely fucked.",,N,0.0,2025-07-29 18:56:06.923475

In addition to updating your own DEERS record, your service personnel office will sometimes update your DEERS record following important life events, like retirement.
Check your DEERS record The first step is to check your DEERS record.
Update your DEERS record If you need to update or correct your DEERS record, do so immediately.
Maintain your DEERS record Throughout the year, you may experience changes that require you to update your DEERS record.","When was the last time you looked to see if your information in the Defense Enrollment Eligibility Reporting System is up to date? If it’s been a while, it’s extremely important to take time and log in to DEERS to review or update your information.

DEERS is key to managing military health benefits, supporting the needs of service members, retirees, and their family members. You should make sure to update your information in DEERS so your family can get the benefits they deserve.

The Defense Manpower Data Center operates DEERS. DEERS contains confidential information about the eligibility of service members, retirees, and their family members for benefit and privilege programs administered by the Department of Defense and the uniformed services. It shows if you and your family members are eligible for and enrolled in TRICARE benefits.

But the Defense Health Agency doesn’t administer DEERS—DMDC does. This means you’re responsible for keeping your DEERS information up to date. You should check your DEERS record on the milConnect website at least once every three months to make sure your family’s information is accurate. If you see anything that’s incorrect, get it fixed right away.

In addition to updating your own DEERS record, your service personnel office will sometimes update your DEERS record following important life events, like retirement. So, you should check your DEERS record often—even if you haven’t recently made updates yourself—to ensure it’s correct.

If your DEERS record is incorrect or outdated, it could lead to:

• Delays in accessing health care, filing claims, and getting prescriptions

• An inability for TRICARE to contact you about your health coverage

• Unexpected bills for health care

• Disenrollment from your TRICARE plan

Want to ensure this doesn’t happen to your family? Follow these steps to find and maintain your information in DEERS.

1. Check your DEERS record

The first step is to check your DEERS record. You can do this on the milConnect website. What are some things to check? As described in the TRICARE Qualifying Life Events Fact Sheet, your DEERS record lists your:

• Service status

• Family status

• TRICARE coverage status and plan

• Contact information, including phone number, mailing address, and email address

You should also review the information for each family member and confirm your personnel, service, and eligibility status are accurate.

Keep in mind, each family member must be registered in DEERS before they can have TRICARE coverage. If you’re a sponsor, you’re automatically registered in DEERS, but you must register your eligible family members.

2. Update your DEERS record

If you need to update or correct your DEERS record, do so immediately. Sponsors and family members can update their contact information. Your contact information includes your phone number, mailing address, and email address. Here are your options for updating your contact information in DEERS:

• Online: Log in to the milConnect website

• Phone: 800-538-9552 (TTY/TDD: 866-363-2883)

• Mail:

DMDC/DEERS Support Office

Attention: COA

400 Gigling Road

Seaside, CA 93955-6771

• Fax: 800-336-4416

If you need to add or remove family members, sponsors must do this in person promptly by going to their nearest ID card office. Only sponsors can add or remove family members. Call or check online for your ID card office’s operating hours and to make an appointment. Don’t forget to bring supporting documents, such as a birth certificate, marriage certificate, or divorce decree.

3. Maintain your DEERS record

Throughout the year, you may experience changes that require you to update your DEERS record. So, the third step is to continue to update your information as soon as a change occurs. You can do this by making sure that every time you have a qualifying life event, you update your DEERS information.

A QLE “unlocks” a 90-day period for you to make changes to your plan. Common examples of QLEs include:

• Retiring or separating from active duty

• Getting married

• Giving birth or adopting

• Moving

• Becoming eligible for Medicare

• Gaining or losing other health insurance

Following these steps will help you avoid any break in your TRICARE coverage. Unlock your health by going to DEERS to learn more.",https://d1ldvf68ux039x.cloudfront.net/thumbs/photos/2408/8587670/1000w_q95.jpg,N,0.0,2025-07-29 17:56:28.714447

“Military families have sacrificed so much for this country – it’s absolutely unacceptable that they don’t have access to the same health care as every other American,” Ryan said in a statement.
“Our military families have stepped up and sacrificed for us, now we need to do right by them.” Other advocates said the bill would go a long way in assisting families.
“Military families shouldn’t have to pay more than civilians to provide healthcare to their young adult children,” said Besa Pinchotti, chief executive officer of the National Military Family Association, in a statement.
Dependents have the option to enroll in the TRICARE Young Adult program, and nearly 33,000 military families choose to do so, Ryan said.","KINGSTON, N.Y. — U.S. Rep. Pat Ryan, an Iraq War veteran who is a member of the House Armed Services Committee, has once again introduced a bill that would extend healthcare coverage to the children of active-duty military personnel and veterans.

The bill, known as the “Health Care Fairness for Military Families Act,” was first unsuccessfully pushed by Ryan in 2023, along with former U.S. Rep. Marc Molinaro, a Republican from Catskill.

The legislation, if enacted, would extend health care coverage to TRICARE (Active Duty and Retired) beneficiaries who have adult children younger than 26 years old, lowering costs and ensuring access for hundreds of thousands of military families across the country, Ryan’s office said in a news release.

“Military families have sacrificed so much for this country – it’s absolutely unacceptable that they don’t have access to the same health care as every other American,” Ryan said in a statement. “I’m proud that my legislation will right this wrong, and – especially amid rising health care costs in the Hudson Valley and nationwide – will deliver much-needed relief to military families across the country.”

“By extending TRICARE eligibility to 26, hundreds of thousands of military families will save as much as $8,724 per year,” the congressman added. “Our military families have stepped up and sacrificed for us, now we need to do right by them.”

Other advocates said the bill would go a long way in assisting families.

“Military families shouldn’t have to pay more than civilians to provide healthcare to their young adult children,” said Besa Pinchotti, chief executive officer of the National Military Family Association, in a statement. “Military families are paying hundreds of dollars each month to provide health coverage for the young adults in their families, while civilian families face no increase in cost related to age.”

Under current law, TRICARE dependents may only remain on their parents’ policy until they are 21, according to Ryan.

If they are enrolled as a full-time student in an approved institution and if their parent pays more than half of their financial support, the dependent may remain on their parents’ policy until they turn 23 years old or are out of school, whichever comes first, Ryan’s office said.

Dependents have the option to enroll in the TRICARE Young Adult program, and nearly 33,000 military families choose to do so, Ryan said. “However, they must spend between $337 and $727 per month to cover the full cost of the program via a separate monthly premium, in a time when costs are rising and families across the country are feeling a strain on their wallets,” the news release said.",https://www.dailyfreeman.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/DFN-L-041725-ryan-police-push-12-rotated.jpg?w=1024&h=768,N,0.0,2025-07-29 17:56:33.146976

The new cloud-based myAuth is more secure than DS Logon and will simplify the verification process, according to Defense Department officials.
According to the official, the DS Logon system is outdated and has several major issues that make it obsolete.

Roughly 20 million people will eventually move to the new system, myAuth, from the legacy DS Logon authentication system used by roughly 200 DoD and VA websites. The new cloud-based myAuth is more secure than DS Logon and will simplify the verification process, according to Defense Department officials.

""Our beneficiaries, our veterans, our uniform service vendors -- they let us know that they need a credentialing service that better fits their needs and that is more user friendly, [one] that offers them password-less options,"" a defense official said in an interview Monday with Military.com.

The Defense Department will introduce the new system in phases and has started with milConnect, the website for benefits and the Defense Enrollment Eligibility Reporting System, and ID Card Office Online. Users who go to access those websites via their Common Access Cards or DS Logon credentials will receive prompts to create myAuth accounts.

As of last week, more than 900,000 people, including active-duty service members, dependents, retirees and their family members, had created myAuth accounts.

""Our goal with myAuth was to create a quicker and simpler ... efficient way to access our DoD websites,"" the defense official said.

According to the Defense Department, the myAuth system will let personnel, including service members, civilian employees, contractors and vendors, access personal and business information while on the go when they don't have access to a CAC-enabled computer.

For example, a soldier who needs to access the Defense Travel System to change plans could log in from the road or an airport using myAuth and its affiliated authenticator app, Okta Verify, on their personal computer or cell phone.

According to the official, the DS Logon system is outdated and has several major issues that make it obsolete. It requires users to log in frequently, which is not normally a problem with active-duty personnel and civilian employees who work on government computers but presents roadblocks to those who use it on an as-needed basis. DS Logon also mandated a password change every 60 days, with intricate password requirements.

""The number one complaint that we get is how much of a pain remembering the complex requirements of a password -- so many characters, alphanumeric, can't repeat. You can't have your birth date or anything identifying. It needs to be unique,"" the defense official said.

The new system uses Okta Verify, an app that is installed on a computer or cell phone, for multifactor authentication. The app-based program may present some challenges to users unfamiliar with verification apps or who don't have a smartphone, but the official said the system will ""flex"" to meet their needs.

They added that 99% of users who have requested myAuth credentials have been able to obtain them. A call center has been established at 800-538-9552 to help those who have issues getting a new login or downloading the Okta Verify app.

According to the defense official, the DoD budget includes $8.1 million over the next three years to implement myAuth. But by building the myAuth system so that it uses existing DS Logon accounts to create accounts, the DoD saved $22 million by not having to pay for reverification costs, they added.

The department also is consolidating infrastructure, call center, license support and operational costs -- changes that are expected to save an additional $36 million in the coming years, the official said.

To get a myAuth account, users must have a DS Logon or a CAC card. Those who don't have a CAC or a DS Logon must create a one-time DS Logon account in the next 18 months and then create a myAuth account. If they wait until after the DS Logon system is gone, they will need to reverify their identities, according to the department.

DS Logon isn't the only system that will be replaced by myAuth. According to the Defense Department, other authentication systems across the department will be retired with the adoption of myAuth.

DoD websites that require a DS Logon include eBenefits, Tricare, Military OneSource, MHS Genesis, the Army's Transition Assistance Program portal, and more.

VA websites that use it include AccessVA, the Veteran ID Card center and the VetBiz portal.

The Defense Manpower Data Center is working with the Defense Health Agency to communicate the change to non-CAC card holders through frequently used websites like Tricare, according to the defense official.

""Part of our communication plan is to try and get these veterans signed up now, so when the transition occurs, there's no change to them. They can just use the credential that they've created, already got,"" they said.

Service members often turn to these products to improve performance, build muscle, lose weight, or improve overall health. Unfortunately, the use of some dietary supplements can compromise performance rather than improve it.

“With so many products and claims out there, it can be hard for service members to know what information to trust when it comes to dietary supplements,” said U.S. Army Maj. Jordan DeMay, a dietitian for the U.S. Army Training & Doctrine Command. “Fortunately, Operation Supplement Safety offers trusted, evidence-based tools and resources to help guide informed decisions.”

Operation Supplement Safety, the program of record under the Consortium for Health and Military Performance at the Uniformed Services University, provides evidence-based educational information about dietary supplements, health and wellness products and ingredients. The website has resource and tools to assist service members in making informed decisions about dietary supplements and their ingredients.

Department of Defense Instruction 6130.06, “Use of Dietary Supplements in the DOD,” formalizes OPSS as the Department of Defense program for dietary supplements. It also stipulates that the DOD Prohibited Dietary Supplement Ingredients List is housed on the OPSS website. Service members may not take supplements with any ingredient from the prohibited list.

“The OPSS team works closely with all the services to increase education and awareness to promote safer supplement use across the force,” said DeMay. “Tools like the OPSS Scorecard help service members evaluate products right at the point of purchase, and understanding third-party certification can make a big difference in avoiding harmful or banned substances.”

Supplement Safety Tips for Awareness

Before considering taking supplements, service members should know what to avoid when reviewing the label of a dietary supplement, including controlled substances, prescriptions, over the counter drugs, and unapproved drugs.

OPSS provides the following tips if you’re considering the use of a dietary supplement:

Talk with your healthcare provider before taking a dietary supplement. Understand that, by definition, a dietary supplement cannot be used to treat, cure, or prevent any diseases and should not be used in replacement of recommended medications.

Consider the consequences of mixing a dietary supplement with other supplements and medications.

Dietary supplements may change the effectiveness of prescription or over-the-counter medications.

Dietary supplements may interact with prescription and over-the-counter medications and may cause negative side effects.

Dietary supplements may interact with prescription meds needed before, during, and after surgery.

You may consume too much of an ingredient if it is found in multiple dietary supplements you are consuming.

Take only as described on the label.

Do not use dietary supplements as a replacement for consuming a balanced eating pattern. Dietary supplements rarely have the same beneficial effects as eating whole foods.

Do not assume the term ""natural"" means a product is “safe” or has added benefits.

Learn to spot false claims. If something sounds too good to be true, it probably is.

Dietary supplements are not reviewed or approved by the Food and Drug Administration prior to being marketed

Look for dietary supplements that display the label of a well-vetted, third party certification program. This will help you avoid adverse events and experiencing a positive drug test.

Always check the DOD Prohibited Dietary Supplement Ingredients List before using any dietary supplement.

The Health Care Fairness for Military Families Act (H.R. 4768/S. 2448) would address this injustice, allowing military dependents to remain on a parent’s plan until age 26, matching the requirement for civilian plans and saving military families as much as $8,724 per year.

“Ensuring our nation’s all-volunteer force remains strong means prioritizing the health and well-being of military families,” MOAA President and CEO Lt. Gen. Brian T. Kelly, USAF (Ret), said. “A key part of that effort is making TRICARE a competitive, modern health benefit that supports both recruiting and retention.”

Young adults who stay on a parent’s plan maintain access to medical care during a period of major life transition without facing high out-of-pocket costs or risky coverage gaps. Military families were excluded from this protection, as TRICARE coverage ends at 21 (or at 23 for full-time college students).

Once they lose coverage, dependents can purchase TRICARE Young Adult (TYA), costing military families between $337 and $727 a month. Shrinking TYA enrollment suggests this cost is unsustainable for many military families.

“As a Navy veteran, military spouse, and Mom, I know firsthand how much military families sacrifice,” Kiggans said in the release. “Our military families deserve the same peace of mind as every other American family — especially when it comes to healthcare.”

Military families “earned access to the same high-quality health care that American families expect,” Kelly said in the release. “That’s why we’re fixing this gap in TRICARE coverage, so young adult children in military families aren’t left behind.”

A federal judge blocked Arkansas’ first-in-the-nation law regulating pharmacy benefit managers, stating in Monday’s order that it “likely violates” the U.S. Constitution’s commerce clause and is “likely preempted” by a veterans’ health care program.

Act 624 of 2025 would have banned pharmacy benefit managers (PBMs) from holding a permit to operate a drug store in Arkansas after Jan. 1, 2026. PBMs negotiate prescription benefits among drug manufacturers, distributors, pharmacies and health insurance providers, and the biggest ones also own pharmacies and insurers.

Four PBMs, including the three largest in the nation, and the Pharmaceutical Care Management Association (PCMA) filed four challenges to Act 624 between May and June. The U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Arkansas combined the four complaints into one case.

Both sides presented their arguments to U.S. District Judge Brian Miller on Wednesday. In Monday’s 17-page order, Miller granted the plaintiffs’ request for a preliminary injunction, and the case is expected to go to trial.

Miller agreed with the plaintiffs’ attorneys that Act 624 violates the Commerce Clause of the U.S. Constitution because it “appears to overtly discriminate against plaintiffs as out of state companies and the state has failed to show that it has no other means to advance its interests,” he wrote.

“This is true because section one of Act 624 specifically states that its purpose is to eliminate plaintiffs’ ‘business tactics that have driven locally-operated pharmacies out of business,’” Miller wrote. “…Although the state argues that it is merely targeting a form of business structure, this appears to only be a half-truth because the statute discloses that the state is also attempting to protect ‘locally-operated pharmacies’ as opposed to just consumers and non-PBM affiliated pharmacies, including out of state non-PBM affiliated pharmacies like Walgreens.”

Miller called Act 624 Arkansas’ “latest and most aggressive” attempt to regulate PBMs in recent years. Act 900 of 2015 required PBMs to pay pharmacies at least the national average of what drugstores pay wholesalers for drugs, and two 2018 laws prohibited PBMs from reimbursing their affiliated pharmacies in Arkansas at a higher rate than their locally owned competitors. An additional statute prohibits PBMs from excluding a pharmacy from a health benefit plan if the pharmacy “is willing to accept the health benefit plan’s operating terms and conditions.”

Lawmakers, state insurance department officials, independent pharmacists and the Arkansas Pharmacists’ Association have repeatedly claimed that PBMs routinely violate Act 900 and the 2018 statutes, creating a struggle for independent pharmacies in rural areas to remain operational.

However, “based on the evidence in the record, it appears that these laws are sufficient for the state to achieve its stated purposes of curtailing plaintiffs’ business tactics and minimizing the conflicts of interest inherent in PBM-affiliated pharmacies,” Miller wrote.

He also agreed with plaintiff Express Scripts’ claim that Act 624 impedes its mail-order pharmacy’s requirement to provide prescription medication to members of the military, their families and veterans in Arkansas. ESI Mail Pharmacy Inc. is the primary mail-order pharmacy provider for Tricare, the military’s health insurance program.

Act 624 allows the state pharmacy board to issue limited permits to PBMs if they provide “drugs that are otherwise unavailable in the market to a patient or a pharmacy that would otherwise be prohibited” under the law. Daniel Volchok, Express Scripts’ attorney, said last week that this provision is insufficient because it covers only a “subset” of medications approved by the Department of Defense for Tricare participants.

The plaintiffs’ attorneys made several other arguments for an injunction that Miller said did not have merit. In one such argument, an attorney for OptumRx, one of the three largest PBMs along with Express Scripts and CVS Caremark, argued that Act 624 violates the federal Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974.

Portions of Iowa’s pharmacy benefit manager law blocked as lawsuit advances

The law, known as ERISA, sets certain standards for employee benefit plans, but Act 624 “does not regulate PBMs in their capacity as employee benefit plan administrators” and instead simply regulates pharmacy licensure, Miller wrote.

An Iowa law meant to regulate PBMs was partially blocked in federal court last week because its mandates of certain cost-sharing arrangements between pharmacies and PBMs potentially violated ERISA, according to the judge’s ruling. Similarly to Arkansas, supporters of the new Iowa law said it would help rural and small pharmacies remain in business.

Miller also rejected the plaintiffs’ argument that Act 624 is an unconstitutional bill of attainder, meaning it imposes a legislative punishment without due process. He said the law does not name specific plaintiffs even though it targets “a very narrow group.”

“While Act 624 is tainted by its protectionist rhetoric so much as to render it unconstitutional under the Commerce Clause, it was not enacted in a wholly arbitrary manner,” Miller wrote.

CVS Health, which includes plaintiff CVS Caremark, expressed opposition to Act 624 during this year’s legislative session and said the law would force the company’s 23 Arkansas pharmacies to close.

In a statement Monday, CVS Health praised Miller’s ruling and said it is “actively looking to work together with the state to reduce drug prices and ensure access to pharmacies.”

The Cigna Group, which owns Express Scripts, also praised the ruling in a Tuesday statement.

“We appreciate the Court acting to protect Arkansans’ access to their pharmacies,” Chief Legal Officer Andrea Nelson said. “Every day, our nurses, pharmacists and other dedicated team members provide care to Arkansas patients that can’t be easily replaced, and we will continue doing everything we can to protect Arkansas patients’ access to care and affordable medicines.”",https://arkansasadvocate.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Pharmacist.jpg,N,0.0,2025-07-29 17:56:57.731727

U.S. District Judge Brian Miller agreed with the plaintiffs that the Arkansas law bans the interstate commerce clause.

The Arkansas law ""appears to overtly discriminate against plaintiffs as out-of-state companies, and the state has failed to show that it has no other means to advance its interests,"" the judge wrote in an order posted Monday.

One section of the Arkansas law ""specifically states that its purpose is to eliminate plaintiffs' 'business tactics that have driven locally-operated pharmacies out of business,'"" the judge wrote. ""Although the state argues that it is merely targeting a form of business structure, this appears to only be a half-truth because the statute discloses that the state is also attempting to protect 'locally-operated pharmacies' as opposed to just consumers and non-PBM affiliated pharmacies, including out-of-state non-PBM affiliated pharmacies like Walgreens.""

The impact: Both the Arkansas law and the litigation could have a big effect on state efforts to regulate health care services and product providers all around the United States.

Employer groups, health care provider groups, antitrust groups and other groups see the Arkansas PBM ownership law fight as a template for future fights over state efforts to regulate ""vertical integration,"" or efforts by a large company at one level in a supply chain for a good or service to combine with a large company at another level in the same supply chain.

Interstate commerce: Miller, who was nominated by former President George W. Bush, suggested that looking at a law's legislative history is often a bad strategy because elected officials ""can junk up the record with meaningless drivel,"" but he said a review of the Arkansas law's legislative history ""indicates that it overtly discriminates against out-of-state companies.""

The Arkansas law also imposes an excessive burden, because Arkansas already has other PBM laws, such as a law that requires a PBM to open its network to any pharmacy willing to meet its terms and conditions, that can protect local pharmacies and independent pharmacies from unfair competition, Miller ruled.

Miller also agreed with the plaintiffs that the Arkansas law would violate federal efforts to protect Tricare from state laws.

ERISA: Miller found that the plaintiffs are unlikely to prevail on their arguments about ERISA preemption.

The Arkansas law ""does not have an impermissible connection with ERISA,"" the judge wrote.

The law ""does not regulate PBMs in their capacity as employee benefit plan administrators,"" he added. ""Rather, it merely regulates the requirements for obtaining a retail pharmacy license. And while the effect of this regulation would certainly be 'an influence that [would affect an ERISA] plan's shopping decisions,' it would merely be an 'indirect economic influence' that would 'not bind plan administrators to any particular choice and thus function as a regulation of an ERISA plan itself.'""

Reactions: CVS Health welcomed the new ruling.

""We're pleased with the court's decision to grant a preliminary injunction to stop the implementation,"" the company said. ""We continue to be focused on serving people in Arkansas and are actively looking to work together with the state to reduce drug prices and ensure access to pharmacies.""

A representative for Optum Rx, UnitedHealth's PBM arm, welcomed the preliminary injunction, saying it will let the PBM continue to serve patients in their homes and the clinics they choose.

The Arkansas law ""would reduce access to mail-order, specialty, rare and orphan disease, mental health, and other medications for seniors, residents of rural communities, and people with severe mental health conditions or other complex medical conditions such as cancer and autoimmune disorders — all while increasing the costs of prescription drugs for Arkansans throughout the state,"" the Optum Rx representative said.

A representative for Cigna's Evernorth unit also welcomed the court ruling.

""Every day, our nurses, pharmacists and other dedicated team members provide care to Arkansas patients that can't be easily replaced, and we will continue doing everything we can to protect Arkansas patients' access to care and affordable medicines,"" the Evernorth rep said.

Representatives for Cigna could not immediately be reached for comment.

Arkansas Attorney General Tim Griffin indicated that more court action is coming.",https://k2-prod-alm.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/brightspot/72/8d/3e7dc71241b287e5124ac3568b9f/0923-pbm-contracts-mi.jpg,N,0.0,2025-07-29 17:57:30.732394

,,2025-07-29 15:40:37+00:00,www.army.mil,Joint Munitions Command manages DOD's low-level rad waste | Article - Army.mil,Not Available,,,,,https://www.army.mil/article/287402/joint_munitions_command_manages_dods_low_level_rad_waste,"ROCK ISLAND ARSENAL, Ill. — The Joint Munitions Command serves as the provider for low-level radioactive waste and low-level mixed waste disposition for the Department of Defense and other federal agencies such as the Army Corps of Engineers, Defense Logistics Agency, Defense Health Agency, and Defense Threat Reduction Agency.
The variety of items handled highlights the pervasive, though often unseen, use of radioactive materials in everyday military equipment.
The consolidation facility is specifically designed and equipped to handle radioactive materials, featuring specialized storage areas, processing equipment, and trained personnel.
“We’re always looking for opportunities to recycle and minimize waste,” Kurth said.
Over 198,000 cubic feet of LLRW waste was safely and compliantly disposed of at licensed hazardous waste burial cells.","ROCK ISLAND ARSENAL, Ill. — The Joint Munitions Command serves as the provider for low-level radioactive waste and low-level mixed waste disposition for the Department of Defense and other federal agencies such as the Army Corps of Engineers, Defense Logistics Agency, Defense Health Agency, and Defense Threat Reduction Agency.

The program ensures these materials are managed in a safe, compliant, and cost-effective manner, protecting both people and the environment. The scope of this responsibility extends far beyond simply disposal; it encompasses the entire lifecycle of these materials from identification to final resting place.

Annually, JMC develops a budget to support assigned Army LLRW responsibilities. Funding goes towards licenses, permits, required training, safety gear and supplies, and U.S. Department of Energy recycling fees. The remaining resources support disposal projects involving the logistical complexities of global travel, specialized packaging materials, and the ongoing maintenance of the consolidation facility, which is managed by JMC.

“Securing consistent funding is vital to the program’s long-term viability and our ability to continue providing essential services to the DOD,” said Mike Kurth, Chief of JMC's Environmental/Health Physics Division. “Fluctuations in funding can impact the program's capacity to respond to urgent requests or invest in new technologies for improved waste management.”

Since 1992, members of JMC's low-level radioactive waste program have traveled across the globe to safely pack and ensure the shipment of common commodities like compasses, chemical agent detectors, optical lenses, and sighting and alignment devices — among other standard issue items for service members and military facilities.

These missions often take personnel to remote locations, including active military bases, storage facilities, and even decommissioned sites. The team works closely with site personnel to identify, categorize, and prepare the waste for transport, adhering to strict regulatory guidelines. The variety of items handled highlights the pervasive, though often unseen, use of radioactive materials in everyday military equipment. This work is essential to maintaining operational readiness while responsibly managing hazardous materials.

In the fall of 2023, a member of JMC’s LLRW team oversaw the preparation and packing of thirteen 55-gallon drums containing contaminated soil in Okinawa, Japan, as part of a complex disposal mission. The individual, a health physicist, was the project manager for the effort, and ensured the work was performed compliantly, timely, and cost effectively. In October 2017, a Marine Corps CH-53E helicopter made an emergency landing in a field outside the Northern Training Area in Okinawa due to an engine fire and was subsequently destroyed, leaving behind contaminated soil. The affected area was excavated, and lab testing revealed hazardous chemicals and radioactive strontium-90 from the aircraft's inspection system. The excavated material, stored at Camp Kinser, was contracted for disposal in the United States.

Despite the technical nature of the work, LLRW missions are not inherently dangerous. Rigorous safety protocols and extensive training minimize risk.

“Safety is always our top priority,” Kurth said. “We follow strict procedures and provide our personnel with the best possible equipment.”

A U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission license allows in-house acceptance at a JMC-managed consolidation facility for any type of low-level radioactive material, as well as processing for recycling or disposal. This license is a testament to the program’s commitment to safety and regulatory compliance.

“The NRC license demonstrates our ability to meet the highest standards of safety and accountability,” Kurth said.

The consolidation facility is specifically designed and equipped to handle radioactive materials, featuring specialized storage areas, processing equipment, and trained personnel. The ability to accept a wide range of materials allows JMC to serve a diverse customer base and streamline the disposal process. Recycling efforts, where feasible, are a key component of the program, reducing the overall volume of waste requiring burial.

“We’re always looking for opportunities to recycle and minimize waste,” Kurth said. “It’s the responsible thing to do, both environmentally and economically.”

Last year, JMC’s LLRW team completed 156 radioactive pack, ship, and disposal projects totaling $8.7 million. Over 198,000 cubic feet of LLRW waste was safely and compliantly disposed of at licensed hazardous waste burial cells.

“The numbers demonstrate the scale of our operation and our commitment to responsible waste management,” Kurth said. “We’re proud of the work we do to protect people and the environment.”

This impressive volume demonstrates the program's efficiency and effectiveness in managing a significant amount of radioactive waste. The disposal process is meticulously documented and tracked to ensure full accountability and compliance with all applicable regulations. The licensed hazardous waste burial cells are carefully selected and monitored to prevent any environmental contamination. The success of these projects underscores the dedication and expertise of the JMC team and their commitment to protecting both people and the planet.

“People are often surprised to learn how many items contain small amounts of radioactive material,” Kurth said. “Our job is to ensure those items are handled responsibly at the end of their life.”",https://api.army.mil/e2/c/images/2025/07/29/bdf9885e/max1200.jpg,N,0.0,2025-07-29 12:40:33.834467

“A medical readiness event, like this rodeo, brings together medical professionals under one roof who can efficiently check off a lot of these boxes.
Medics crucial in battlefield and at home The health readiness rodeo is testament to the crucial trust between provider and patient.
“By ensuring our service members have every opportunity to maintain their well-being, we enable our warfighters to deploy on a dime to win America’s battles.”","Andrew Rader Army Health Clinic, at Joint Base Myer-Henderson Hall, Virginia, hosted its monthly, walk-in health readiness rodeo designed to “enable the readiness of our joint force,” said U.S. Army Sgt. 1st Class Matthew Matack, the clinic’s senior enlisted leader. The rodeo was held on July 18, 2025.

The rodeo aims to ensure service members in the National Capital Region are ready to deploy by offering fast and complete care. Soldiers, sailors, airmen, and Marines can update medical records, complete exams, and get cleared for duty—all in a single visit.

“There are dozens of examinations and training requirements that must be completed before a service member is considered deployable,” said U.S. Army Command Sgt. Maj. Kenyon Simmons, Joint Base Myer-Henderson Hall. “A medical readiness event, like this rodeo, brings together medical professionals under one roof who can efficiently check off a lot of these boxes. The streamlined process makes it much easier to ensure the readiness of our warfighters to deploy at a moment’s notice.”

These events streamline routine care by providing services such as immunizations, labs, vision, hearing, and periodic health assessments, allowing service members to stay focused on training and mission tasks without prolonged clinic wait times, according to U.S. Army Staff Sgt. Emilio Rios, the clinic’s noncommissioned officer in charge.

Medical ‘team effort’

Each readiness event is coordinated across multiple military health units. “It’s a team effort across the installation to utilize all of our providers, staff, and medics to support this event to ensure the readiness of warfighters who attend from across the NCR,” said Matack.

Bringing in professionals from multiple departments and locations is key for the success of the rodeo, according to U.S. Army Capt. Anna Zhang, clinic director of readiness and optometry. “While a majority of core staff are from Rader, we also call upon medics from the 3rd U.S. Infantry Regiment and providers from McNair Health Clinic.”

“Our monthly readiness rodeos provide service members with an opportunity to address all their medical readiness concerns in one visit,” Zhang added. “Vision, immunizations, audiology, and laboratory services are available on a walk-in basis daily at Andrew Rader Health Clinic—but on rodeo days, we have providers performing the periodic health assessment as a walk-in service as well.”

Health readiness rodeos ensure ready medical force

The rodeo isn’t just good for troops. It also strengthens medical staff. Matack emphasized the critical, multiple roles of his medics to ensure service members meet mission demands, calling them the “Swiss-Army knives” of the team. He credited Rios, and active duty logistics and medical staff for their work to “cross-train their medics to make them more versatile.”

“Our medics and staff get regular, hands-on experience across multiple readiness tasks, keeping their clinical skills sharp and ensuring they’re just as ready to deploy as the service members they support,” said Rios.

Busy rodeo events help them get practice working quickly and effectively, he said, skills they’ll need during emergencies or deployments. “Our high-traffic rodeo days can help our healthcare professionals hone their ability to efficiently and effectively operate at scale if and when necessary,” said Zhang.

Medics crucial in battlefield and at home

The health readiness rodeo is testament to the crucial trust between provider and patient. “As warfighters, we would not be able to accomplish our mission without medics and other healthcare professionals,” Simmons said. “Every time we step on the battlefield, we’re comforted to know that a medic is nearby. If we get hit, our survivability rate goes up exponentially when the medic responds to us quickly.”

In today’s high-demand operational environment, that trust is essential to mission success. “Trust is the foundation of a patient-provider relationship,” Zhang said. “Patients depend on healthcare professionals to fix and address their ailments, which makes them feel safe, creating mental resilience.”

The services offered by the rodeo cultivate this trust, and “ultimately, preserve the fighting force,” she said.

The event, ultimately, demonstrates one crucial constant: the unwavering support of the medics, health professionals, and the Defense Health Agency to ensure warfighter readiness. “A medically ready force is a ready force,” Zhang said. “By ensuring our service members have every opportunity to maintain their well-being, we enable our warfighters to deploy on a dime to win America’s battles.”",https://dha.mil/-/media/Project/Images/News-Images/9223403.jpg,N,0.0,2025-07-29 17:57:44.816899

The TRICARE West region contract transitioned from Health Net Federal Services (HNFS) to TriWest Healthcare Alliance.
​ Both TRICARE contractors reassured healthcare providers and beneficiaries the transition would be seamless and there would be no services interruptions.
​ This survey was developed as a grassroots effort to determine effects to the beneficiaries' access to healthcare services.

​

The TRICARE East contracting company, Humana Military, transitioned from Wisconsin Physicians Services (WPS) Health Solutions to a new fiscal intermediary/claims processor, Palmetto Government Business Administrators (PGBA). The TRICARE West region contract transitioned from Health Net Federal Services (HNFS) to TriWest Healthcare Alliance.

​

Both TRICARE contractors reassured healthcare providers and beneficiaries the transition would be seamless and there would be no services interruptions.

​

However, the transition has been marked by serious complications with many beneficiaries reporting barriers to receiving appropriate medical services and extra financial consts.

​

This survey was developed as a grassroots effort to determine effects to the beneficiaries' access to healthcare services. It is not intended to be used for research purposes, but to serve as an indicator for potential larger issues within the military healthcare system.​

Conclusion

Since the launch of the new TRICARE contracts on January 1, 2025, families across the country have experienced a catastrophic disruption in care. Sixty-one percent of survey respondents in TRICARE East and seventy-five percent in TRICARE West reported a disruption in medical services.

​

Obtaining prior authorizations and referrals was a barrier encountered by the majority of survey respondents in both TRICARE regions. This remains a prevalent barrier despite the Defense Health Agency issuing a waiver to allow specialty care referrals without a prior authorization for TRICARE prime beneficiaries. A theme in the military family comments was that providers would not honor the waiver due to lack of trust that TRICARE would later pay for the services provided.

​

The source of these failures lies not only with the regional contractors - Humana Military (East) and TriWest Healthcare Alliance (West) - but with the Defense Health Agency (DHA), which bears full responsibility for contract oversight and system accountability.

​

The DHA's implementation and oversight of the transition to new managed care organizations has been fraught with problems that have had severe adverse effects on TRICARE beneficiaries as well as providers.

​

In order to minimize harm to TRICARE beneficiaries, we urge Congress and the Department of Defense to quickly remedy these issues and take steps to ensure the highest quality of healthcare for our men and women serving in uniform as well as their families. Failure to do so will result in decreased readiness, resilience, and retention for our armed forces.","https://static.wixstatic.com/media/6fd4e9_459a9142f92440078e1a2ac2b1849da8%7Emv2.jpeg/v1/fit/w_2500,h_1330,al_c/6fd4e9_459a9142f92440078e1a2ac2b1849da8%7Emv2.jpeg",N,0.0,2025-07-29 08:56:34.085367

“We have some very, very strange patterns of deposits [from Humana],” Myers said.
“If things don’t improve, we will have to make some really difficult decisions because we have lost our trust in TRICARE and in Humana Military,” Myers said.
Meanwhile, Rep. Jen Kiggans (R-Va. Beach) announced Monday she wants to expand the TRICARE program.
Kiggans wants to align TRICARE eligibility for dependents with the Affordable Care Act for civilians.","VIRGINIA BEACH (WAVY) — The co-owner of a behavioral health practice in the Lynnhaven area of Virginia Beach said “it’s been a nightmare” dealing with TRICARE claims after Humana Military switched its claims processor to PGBA at the beginning of the year.

“We’ve always had issues, but never to this degree,” said Suzanna Myers in a Monday morning interview. She, her business partner and 12 other providers treat military kids with autism at Pennington Group Full Spectrum Services.

Myers said the bureaucratic hassles have entered a new more frustrating phase.

“We are seeing a lot of erroneous denials,” she said. “There has been a lot of confusion, and we’ve gotten a lot of mixed messages.”

Myers said the problems really began to spiral downward in January when Humana entered a contract with PGBA. She had a banking background before her son with autism inspired her to change careers.

“We have some very, very strange patterns of deposits [from Humana],” Myers said. “And when we have gotten paid, it’s been an administrative and accounting nightmare for us.”

Myers said about 95% of her practice is military families, with annual revenue about $1.5 million.

“It’s a couple hundred thousand dollars a month that is kind of in limbo,” she said. “My business partner and I actually issued loans to our providers using our own personal savings because it was just dire. People were not going to be able to keep a roof over their head or food on the table. So this has been very stressful.”

It was stressful enough for some of her staff to head for the door.

“I have lost two providers because of this,” Myers said, adding that chasing down reimbursement from Humana is keeping her from her core mission. “Personally, I love practicing and working hands-on with my patients. I was unable to do any work with my patients for the first four months of the year.”

10 On Your Side reached out to Humana for comment and they did not immediately respond.

In addition to waiting for reimbursement, Myers said Humana recently sent a number of documents with patients’ private information to the wrong address, one her practice hasn’t used for six years.

“If things don’t improve, we will have to make some really difficult decisions because we have lost our trust in TRICARE and in Humana Military,” Myers said.

Meanwhile, Rep. Jen Kiggans (R-Va. Beach) announced Monday she wants to expand the TRICARE program. Kiggans is a veteran Navy helicopter pilot and mother of four.

Kiggans wants to align TRICARE eligibility for dependents with the Affordable Care Act for civilians. The ACA permits dependents to remain on their parents’ plan until age 26. Currently, TRICARE permits coverage for dependents on parents’ plans only until 21.

“As a Navy veteran, military spouse and Mom, I know firsthand how much military families sacrifice,” Kiggans said in a news release Monday afternoon. “The fact that they’re forced to pay hundreds of dollars a month to keep their young adult children on TRICARE — while civilians can keep theirs covered at no cost until age 26 — is simply unfair. I’m proud to support this bipartisan legislation to fix that. Our military families deserve the same peace of mind as every other American family — especially when it comes to healthcare.”",https://www.wavy.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2025/07/snapshot-2025-07-28T194200.880.jpg?w=1280,N,0.0,2025-07-29 00:02:35.889496

“I’m proud to introduce the Health Care Fairness for Military Families Act, bipartisan legislation to ensure adult children from military families can keep their TRICARE coverage until they are 26, the same as private insurance plans.
This commonsense bill will save hundreds of thousands of American military families thousands of dollars every year.” “Military families who rely on TRICARE for health care coverage should be treated the same as their civilian counterparts.
By providing coverage for military dependents until age 26, the Health Care Fairness for Military Families Act will lower healthcare costs for military families and establish equity between TRICARE and private plans,” said With Honor Co-Founder & CEO Rye Barcott.
Nearly 33,000 military families have dependents enrolled in the TRICARE Young Adult program; however, military families must spend between $337 and $727 per month to cover the full cost of the program via a separate monthly premium.","Concord, N.H. – Congresswoman Maggie Goodlander, a member of the House Armed Services Committee, helped introduce the Health Care Fairness for Military Families Act, bipartisan landmark legislation to extend health care coverage to TRICARE (Active Duty and Retired) beneficiaries who have adult children younger than 26 years old, lowering costs and ensuring access for hundreds of thousands of military families across the country. This legislation is sponsored by Congressman Pat Ryan (NY-18).

“We have a sacred obligation to our servicemembers and our military families – that includes ensuring they have the same access to health care coverage as every other American,” said Congresswoman Goodlander. “I’m proud to introduce the Health Care Fairness for Military Families Act, bipartisan legislation to ensure adult children from military families can keep their TRICARE coverage until they are 26, the same as private insurance plans. This commonsense bill will save hundreds of thousands of American military families thousands of dollars every year.”

“Military families who rely on TRICARE for health care coverage should be treated the same as their civilian counterparts. By providing coverage for military dependents until age 26, the Health Care Fairness for Military Families Act will lower healthcare costs for military families and establish equity between TRICARE and private plans,” said With Honor Co-Founder & CEO Rye Barcott. “With Honor Action is proud to endorse this bipartisan legislation as we continue to support service members and their families and honor the sacrifices they’ve made for our country.”

Under current law, TRICARE dependents may only remain on their parents’ policy until they are 21 years old. If they are enrolled as a full-time student in an approved institution and if their parent pays more than half of their financial support, the dependent may remain on their parents’ policy until they turn 23 years old or are out of school, whichever comes first. But, under the Affordable Care Act (ACA), children up to the age of 26 can remain on their parents’ health insurance plans with no additional out-of-pocket cost. This legislation would ensure equity for military families by bringing eligibility for young adult dependents in line with that offered by private insurance plans.

Nearly 33,000 military families have dependents enrolled in the TRICARE Young Adult program; however, military families must spend between $337 and $727 per month to cover the full cost of the program via a separate monthly premium. At a time when costs are rising and families across the country are feeling a strain on their wallets, this legislation will deliver much-needed relief.

Act 624 of 2025 was passed in the most recent Arkansas legislative session and is scheduled to take effect on January 1, 2026.
The Monday ruling places a preliminary injunction on Act 624 pending its full hearing before the court.
In both cases, these are federal constructs that supersede state law.
“We’re pleased with the Court’s decision to grant a preliminary injunction to stop the implementation of Act 624,” a CVS spokesperson said.","LITTLE ROCK, Ark. – A decision in federal court on Monday blocks an Arkansas law from going into effect that blocks PBMs from owning pharmacies.

Act 624 of 2025 was passed in the most recent Arkansas legislative session and is scheduled to take effect on January 1, 2026. It prevented Pharmacy Benefit Managers (PBMs) from owning pharmacies in the state.

A PBM stands between prescription drug plans and pharmacies to set drug prices.

The Monday ruling places a preliminary injunction on Act 624 pending its full hearing before the court. In assigning the injunction, the judge stated the lawsuit seeking to overturn the law will likely succeed based on the act being preempted by the Commerce Clause and the TRICARE prescription claims.

In both cases, these are federal constructs that supersede state law. TRICARE is the pharmacy benefit program for uniformed service members, retired service members and their families.

The opinion also stated that Arkansas has other means to control PBMs than the act’s punitive effect.

Among the groups that lobbied against Act 624 was CVS, which stated that it would be forced to close 28 pharmacies in the state upon the law’s implementation. It filed the lawsuit against the act in May.

“We’re pleased with the Court’s decision to grant a preliminary injunction to stop the implementation of Act 624,” a CVS spokesperson said. “We continue to be focused on serving people in Arkansas and are actively looking to work together with the state to reduce drug prices and ensure access to pharmacies.”

An appeal of the Monday ruling is expected.
