“Right now, almost a quarter of Michigan National Guard members lack health or dental coverage, with many earning too much to qualify for government-sponsored insurance, but not enough to afford private insurance.

There's always arguments for and against rushing into whatever the latest and greatest test medicines are. I'm sad for your situation but placing your entire hope and faith in this one possibility is emotionally draining.

Tricare did the same thing for my mom earlier this summer. They even denied a few things saying it wasn’t medically necessary. Idk how they decide what is and isn’t medically necessary but I full on believe when it comes to cancer they need to approve immediately. It almost 2 months for her to get started with treatment because they took forever.

When i was in years ago as a First Sergeant, I went to the CMSGT on behalf of my Airman. Received clarity on issue, got kinks out of wheel. Patient advocate is another avenue.

It is part of a breakthrough ceasefire after two years of war between Israel and Hamas in the devastated Gaza Strip.
Buses carrying dozens of freed Palestinian prisoners drove to the West Bank city of Ramallah and the Gaza Strip, the Hamas-run Prisoners Office said.
U.S. President Donald Trump is in the region to discuss the U.S.-proposed deal and postwar plans with other leaders.
A surge of humanitarian aid was expected into famine-stricken Gaza, where hundreds of thousands of people have been left homeless.","President Trump directs DoD to ensure funds are available to pay troops during shutdown, Hamas releases all 20 prisoners, and Tricare warns that shutdown could impact payments.

1. President Donald Trump said Saturday that he has directed the Defense Department to use “all available funds” to ensure U.S. troops are paid Wednesday despite the government shutdown, a short-term fix that will not apply to the hundreds of thousands of federal workers who have been furloughed. Trump said in a social media post that he was acting because “our Brave Troops will miss the paychecks they are rightfully due on October 15th.” The president’s directive removes one of the pressure points that could have forced Congress into action, likely ensuring that the shutdown — now in its 11th day and counting — extends into a third week and possibly beyond. But no similar action seems forthcoming for federal employees also working without pay while thousands are now being laid off during the lapse in government operations. The White House budget office started the layoffs on Friday.

2. Hamas released all 20 of the last living hostages on Monday, the Israeli military said. It is part of a breakthrough ceasefire after two years of war between Israel and Hamas in the devastated Gaza Strip. Buses carrying dozens of freed Palestinian prisoners drove to the West Bank city of Ramallah and the Gaza Strip, the Hamas-run Prisoners Office said. Israel is freeing more than 1,900 prisoners as part of the ceasefire deal. U.S. President Donald Trump is in the region to discuss the U.S.-proposed deal and postwar plans with other leaders. A surge of humanitarian aid was expected into famine-stricken Gaza, where hundreds of thousands of people have been left homeless. While major questions remain about the future of Hamas and Gaza, the exchange of hostages and prisoners marked a key step toward ending the deadliest war ever between Israel and the militant group.

3. President Donald Trump on Sunday warned Russia that he may send Ukraine long-range Tomahawk missiles if Moscow doesn’t settle its war there soon — suggesting that he could be ready to increase the pressure on Vladimir Putin’s government using a key weapons system. “I might say, ’Look: if this war is not going to get settled, I’m going to send them Tomahawks,” Trump told reporters aboard Air Force One as he flew to Israel. “The Tomahawk is an incredible weapon, very offensive weapon. And honestly, Russia does not need that.” Trump also said, “I might tell them that if the war is not settled -- that we may very well.” He added, “We may not, but we may do it. I think it’s appropriate to bring up.” His comments came after Trump spoke with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, and Trump said he mentioned possibly sending Tomahawks during that conversation.

4. As the federal government shutdown continues, some Tricare medical providers are being told their claims for services for military families may not be paid until government funding is restored, according to contractors, advocates and the Tricare.mil website. It’s not clear why those claims are delayed or why the money isn’t available now to pay claims for that care, as the Defense Department’s shutdown guidance specifically exempts private-sector care under Tricare from the shutdown’s effects. “You can’t tell providers to keep seeing people free of charge,” said Kristi Cabiao, CEO and founder of Mission Alpha Advocacy, an organization that works to improve quality of life for military families with special needs. “I thought this was an entitlement. I’m really concerned for our families.”",https://www.legion.org/assets/dist/images/favicons/favicon-32x32.png,N,0.0,2025-10-13 11:56:43.481722

Though the shutdown officially began Oct. 1, outside funds from donations and endowments allowed a brief extension. Now, its administrators said, the Smithsonian complex must cease public operations until a budget deal.

The closures affect what had been one of the most accessible forms of public education and sightseeing in the United States With 21 museums, 14 research centers and the National Zoo, the Smithsonian is the largest museum and research network in the world.

The absence of open museums cast a palpable gloom over the capital. Though the weekend brought rainy weather that may have suppressed tourism anyway, the lack of activity around the National Mall left the area unusually quiet.

Washington’s reputation as a destination for cultural visitors has long been tied to its museums, and their closure underscores how dependent the city is on federal operations and how vulnerable that model becomes in shutdowns.

Moreover, many district residents work at various Smithsonian complexes, and the shutdown means a majority of Smithsonian staff members have been furloughed. Some essential operations, like at the National Zoo, must continue for animal care, using existing reserves.

The 163-acre public zoo is home to more than 2,200 animals. The private Conservation Biology Institute is in Front Royal Va., 73 miles away. The two employ in total more than 300 staff members and scientists.

For residents and tourists, the museums and zoo had been a “free of cost” option for learning and cultural engagement.

Most of its museums cluster along or near the National Mall, with several other in the D.C. metro area and two facilities in New York City — also closed because of the shutdown.

The portfolio includes institutions devoted to natural history, air and space, African American history and culture, American art and many specialized fields.

In addition to public galleries and exhibitions, the Smithsonian operates research and education centers.

The Democrats’ stated priority of extending federal subsidies related to Obamacare coverage may now be endangering the health care services for United States military service members, retirees, and their dependents. Although the financial hardships facing medical providers who rely on TRICARE are of nationwide concern, the issue is perhaps more visible in San Antonio, often referred to as “Military City USA” due to the number of Department of War installations located within the city.

San Antonio is home to Joint Base San Antonio, the U.S. military’s largest joint base operation that includes Lackland Air Force Base, Randolph Air Force Base, Fort Sam Houston, and Camp Bullis. Soldiers and Airmen assigned to the bases and their families rely on TRICARE to reimburse civilian health care providers who are now feeling the financial impact of the shutdown.

When Keith Harris’s custom mobile barbershop was stolen in August, he was devastated and had no idea how he was going to keep serving his neighbors, KSAT reported Saturday.

Prior to the trailer being taken, he gave free haircuts to veterans, homeless people, and children in single-parent households because he has a heart to serve.

“When you give someone a haircut, it changes their whole day. It can take like 10 years off people, you know? Especially if you cut real good,” he explained.

KYTX reported in August that his mobile barbershop was worth $40,000 and had been stolen due to what he believes was a broken gate at the storage lot.

However, when community members heard what happened, they decided to do something about it. Devils River Whiskey CEO Mike Cameron partnered with the nonprofit group Wish for Our Heroes to invite the barber to a fundraising gala.

Harris was beyond surprised when they gave him a $5,000 check to help rebuild his trailer.

“That’s no chump change. It’s definitely a blessing,” the veteran said. Other barbers in the area are letting him borrow their mobile setups to continue his work.

Harris has also set up a GoFundMe that as of Sunday afternoon had raised over $2,000.

“Hello my name is Keith Harris. I am a retired Marine and mobile barber. Last Thursday someone stole my mobile barbershop out of Devon Storage. I was using the shop to cut veterans, homeless people, and single parents for free. I am starting over from scratch to build up another mobile shop to get back in the community to cutting hair again.

Vance warns ‘deeper’ cuts ahead for federal workers as shutdown enters 12th dayBy STEVE PEOPLESAP National Politics WriterThe Associated Press

Vice President JD Vance on Sunday said there will be deeper cuts to the federal workforce the longer the government shutdown goes on, adding to the uncertainty facing hundreds of thousands who are already furloughed without pay amid the stubborn stalemate in Congress.

Vance warned that as the federal shutdown entered its 12th day, the new cuts would be “painful,” even as he said the Trump administration worked to ensure that the military is paid this week and some services would be preserved for low-income Americans, including food assistance.

Still, hundreds of thousands of government workers have been furloughed in recent days and, in a court filing on Friday, the Office of Management and Budget said well over 4,000 federal employees would soon be fired in conjunction with the shutdown.

“The longer this goes on, the deeper the cuts are going to be,” Vance said on Fox News’ “Sunday Morning Futures.” “To be clear, some of these cuts are going to be painful. This is not a situation that we relish. This is not something that we’re looking forward to, but the Democrats have dealt us a pretty difficult set of cards.”

Labor unions have already filed a lawsuit to stop the aggressive move by President Donald Trump ’s budget office, which goes far beyond what usually happens in a government shutdown, further inflaming tensions between the Republicans who control Congress and the Democratic minority.

The shutdown began on Oct. 1 after Democrats rejected a short-term funding fix and demanded that the bill include an extension of federal subsidies for health insurance under the Affordable Care Act. The expiration of those subsidies at the end of the year will result in monthly cost increases for millions.

Trump and Republican leaders have said they are open to negotiations on the health subsidies, but insist the government must reopen first.

For now, negotiations are virtually nonexistent. Dug in as ever, House leaders from both parties pointed fingers at each other in rival Sunday appearances on “Fox News Sunday.”

“We have repeatedly made clear that we will sit down with anyone, anytime, anyplace,” said House Democratic leader Hakeem Jeffries of New York. “Republicans control the House, the Senate and the presidency. It’s unfortunate they’ve taken a my-way-or-the-highway approach.”

House Speaker Mike Johnson blamed Democrats and said they “seem not to care” about the pain the shutdown is inflicting.

“They’re trying their best to distract the American people from the simple fact that they’ve chosen a partisan fight so that they can prove to their Marxist rising base in the Democratic Party that they’re willing to fight Trump and Republicans,” he said.

Progressive activists, meanwhile, expressed new support for the Democratic Party’s position in the shutdown fight.

Ezra Levin, co-founder of the leading progressive protest group Indivisible, said he is “feeling good about the strength of Dem position.” He pointed to fractures in the GOP, noting that Georgia Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene publicly warned last week that health care insurance premiums would skyrocket for average Americans — including her own adult children — if nothing is done.

“Trump and GOP are rightfully taking the blame for the shutdown and for looming premium increases,” Levin said. “Their chickens are coming home to roost.”

And yet the Republican administration and its congressional allies are showing no signs of caving to Democratic demands or backing away from threats to use the opportunity to pursue deeper cuts to the federal workforce.

Thousands of employees at the departments of Education, Treasury, Homeland Security and Health and Human Services, as well as the Environmental Protection Agency, are set to receive layoff notices, according to spokespeople for the agencies and union representatives for federal workers.

“You hear a lot of Senate Democrats say, well, how can Donald Trump possibly lay off all of these federal workers?” Vance said. “Well, the Democrats have given us a choice between giving low-income women their food benefits and paying our troops on the one hand, and, on the other hand, paying federal bureaucrats.”

Democrats say the firings are illegal and unnecessary.

“They do not have to do this,” said Democratic Sen. Mark Kelly of Arizona on CNN’s “State of the Union.” “They do not have to punish people that shouldn’t find themselves in this position.”",https://media.breitbart.com/media/2025/10/wi/ap/trump-35230-trump-vice-president-jd-vance-speaks-reporters-james-brady-press-briefing-at-white-hous-640x335.jpg,N,0.0,2025-10-12 17:56:33.584512

“Pink Pony Club is good. Pedophiles are bad. That’s who we’re getting off of our streets. Get a grip,” DHS assistant secretary for public affairs Tricia McLaughlin said, according to TMZ.

Roan has pushed political views before. She has been a huge supporter of the radical transgendering of America’s youth, even donating a portion of every ticket sales to “charities” that push the trans agenda.

Last year, the Missouri-bred singer dedicated her first-ever VMA win to “all the queer kids in the Midwest,” adding, “I am one of you.”

Roan has also used her platform to attack Jews and to show her support for Hamas and Palestinians, an act that HBO host Bill Maher especially scoffed at. He noted that the rabidly queer singer would be the first person Hamas would “throw off a roof” if they had their way because radical Islamists vehemently hate gays.

Ex-NFL QB Mark Sanchez released from custody a week after parking fight arrest and stabbingThe Associated PressINDIANAPOLIS

INDIANAPOLIS (AP) — Former NFL quarterback and sports analyst Mark Sanchez was released from custody Sunday, about a week after police said he was stabbed during a fight with a truck driver outside an Indiana hotel.

The Indianapolis Metropolitan Police Department confirmed Sanchez’s release. He faces a felony battery charge, along with several misdemeanor charges, for what prosecutors have said was a fight over parking.

A police affidavit says the 38-year-old Sanchez, smelling of alcohol, accosted 69-year-old Perry Tole, who had backed his truck into a hotel’s loading docks in downtown Indianapolis on Oct. 4. Tole claims in a lawsuit filed Monday that Sanchez entered the truck without permission, then physically blocked and shoved Tole, who then doused Sanchez with pepper spray.

When Sanchez advanced after being sprayed, Tole pulled a knife to defend himself, authorities said.

Sanchez was hospitalized with stab wounds to his upper right torso, according to a police affidavit. A picture of Tole circulating online shows him in a neck brace on a hospital bed, covered in blood with a deep slash to the side of his face.

Sanchez was in Indianapolis for Fox’s coverage of last Sunday’s game between the Colts and the Las Vegas Raiders.

Sanchez had a 10-year NFL career before retiring in 2019. He spent four seasons with the New York Jets and also appeared in games with Philadelphia, Dallas and Washington.

He appeared on ABC and ESPN for two years before joining Fox Sports as a game analyst in 2021.

A defense attorney for Sanchez didn’t immediately respond to a telephone message seeking comment.",https://www.breitbart.com/favicon.png,N,0.0,2025-10-12 21:56:32.662600

I'm 100% P&T, but I haven't done my intake appointment yet, due to how crowded it is in my area.
Back in March when I was still in, I had allergy testing done at JBLM, and the doctor told me it would be about ten weeks until the allergy shot would arrive.
Unfortunately, it took much longer than 10 weeks, and I ended up getting out before the shipment arrived.
I am still able to set up that appointment for the shot administration at JBLM even though I don't have TRICARE?","Hi guys, I recently got out, and finished my VA claim about two weeks ago.

Back in March when I was still in, I had allergy testing done at JBLM, and the doctor told me it would be about ten weeks until the allergy shot would arrive. Unfortunately, it took much longer than 10 weeks, and I ended up getting out before the shipment arrived. I wasn't medically retired, so I'm not eligible for TRICARE. I'm only covered by VA healthcare, and I guess my questions are; Is there a way to get that transferred over to the VA? I am still able to set up that appointment for the shot administration at JBLM even though I don't have TRICARE? Or will I have to restart the entire process? I appreciate any insight into this situation.",,N,0.0,2025-10-12 12:56:31.260234
