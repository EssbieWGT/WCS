Note: If you don’t know a family member’s DOD ID number, enter the sponsor’s DOD ID number and text “DONE” when prompted.
Getting started at a military pharmacy Are you considering filling your next prescription at a military pharmacy?
Each military pharmacy operates slightly differently, so call ahead and ask the pharmacy a few questions: My provider is going to e-prescribe my medication.
If my civilian provider wants to e-prescribe and they’ve never worked with a military pharmacy before, what can I tell them to make it easier?","Have you recently filled a prescription at a military pharmacy? If so, you may know that military pharmacies have different procedures than civilian pharmacies. When a provider issues a new prescription to a military pharmacy, you need to activate the prescription before a pharmacist fills it.

Recently, the Defense Health Agency has developed and updated two tools—Q-Anywhere and ScriptCenters—to make this prescription pickup process easier and more convenient.

“The Defense Health Agency has integrated Q-Anywhere and ScriptCenters into military pharmacies for multiple reasons,” said U.S. Navy Capt. Emily Zywicke, chief of the Direct Care Branch, Pharmacy Operations Division, at the DHA. “This technology reduces traffic in pharmacy lobbies. It also helps you save time by giving you real-time updates on your prescription status and enabling prescription pickup.”

Q-Anywhere

Q-Anywhere is a feature that allows you to activate new prescriptions without physically being in the pharmacy. To activate your prescription, text “Get in line” to your local military pharmacy’s number. Then, follow the prompts to get a Q-Anywhere number. You can also scan the pharmacy’s QR code for web-based enrollment.

Q: Can I use Q-Anywhere to refill an existing prescription?

A: No. Q-Anywhere is for filling new prescriptions. To refill a prescription, use the MHS GENESIS Patient Portal or call your military pharmacy’s refill number.

Q: Can I text Q-Anywhere in the evening or on the weekends to activate prescriptions?

A: At some military pharmacies, Q-Anywhere is available 24/7, so you may be able to activate your prescription outside of normal business hours. However, the pharmacy staff will process your prescription request during normal business hours.

Q: Will I lose my spot if I’m not present when called?

A: No. If you leave the pharmacy after arriving to pick up your prescription using Q-Anywhere, simply re-text “I’m here” when you return to the pharmacy. Your Q-Anywhere number is only valid on the day it was issued. If you were unable to pick up your prescriptions that day, you’ll have to start a new Q-Anywhere request or pull a number when you arrive at the pharmacy.

(Note: Some pharmacies have a dedicated window you can go to when your prescription is ready for pickup. You can go straight there when you get the text message that your prescription is ready.)

Q: Can I close out the web page messaging system once I get my Q-Anywhere number?

A: Please keep the web page open to get real-time updates from pharmacy staff about your prescriptions and notifications when your prescriptions are ready. However, you can open a new web page to continue using the internet.

Q: Can I use Q-Anywhere to request prescriptions for multiple family members?

A: Yes. Enter the first patient’s Department of Defense Identification Number and wait to get confirmation they’re added. Next, enter the second family member’s DOD ID number. You can add up to four people.

Note: If you don’t know a family member’s DOD ID number, enter the sponsor’s DOD ID number and text “DONE” when prompted. Once you get a text stating “You are now in line,” respond with the name and date of birth of the intended family member and the prescriptions you would like filled.

ScriptCenter

ScriptCenters are automated locker or vending machine-like units. They provide convenient prescription pickup, allowing you to pick up your prescription without interacting with pharmacy staff. The locations of ScriptCenters vary, but many may be available in centralized areas, like the Exchange lobby. Although times vary by pharmacy location, some are available 24/7.

To begin using ScriptCenter, you must complete a one-time in-person enrollment at a ScriptCenter kiosk. You’ll need to scan your Uniformed Services ID card and create a username and PIN. You no longer need to have your prescription number to use ScriptCenter.

“Our military community is incredibly busy, and we understand the struggle of shifting schedules. After-hours prescription pickup helps those who can’t get to the pharmacy during normal operating hours,” added Zywicke. “ScriptCenter decreases congestion in pharmacy lobbies and helps shorten wait times.”

Q: When will my prescriptions be ready in the ScriptCenter?

A: When you request a refill via the MHS GENESIS Patient Portal or a refill phone line, the automated prompts will tell you your pickup time.

Q: What if I forget my “login” ID or PIN?

A: You can recover your User ID or PIN by pressing “Forgot ID” or “Forgot PIN.” Pharmacy staff can help you recover your User ID, but not your PIN. Remember: You can use your DOD ID instead of your User ID to make logging in even easier. But you’ll always need to use your PIN, so be sure to choose something you won’t forget!

Q: How long will my prescriptions be available at the ScriptCenter?

A: Prescriptions are typically left at the ScriptCenter for 7-10 days (this varies by location). After that time, your prescription will be returned to stock and you’ll have to reactivate or refill your prescription again.

Q: Are there any medications that can’t go in ScriptCenter?

A: Prescriptions that require refrigeration won’t be placed in the ScriptCenter.

Q: How does ScriptCenter integrate with MHS GENESIS?

A: If you refill a prescription through your MHS GENESIS Patient Portal, you can request to pick up the medication at a ScriptCenter location (if available).

Q: Can I use Q-Anywhere and ScriptCenter together?

A: Yes, if your military pharmacy uses both systems. When you activate your prescription through Q-Anywhere, you can select ScriptCenter as your pickup location. Be sure you’ve registered with ScriptCenter first.

Other things to note

If you have the US Family Health Plan: You can’t fill prescriptions at military pharmacies. USFHP has its own pharmacy coverage.

Know the difference between prescription refills and renewals: If your provider authorizes refills on your prescription, you can fill the prescription and refill it up to the authorized number of times. A renewal is required when your original prescription expires or runs out of refills. A renewal is considered a new prescription.

Give feedback: Share your experience with Q-Anywhere and ScriptCenter through your military hospital or clinic’s Interactive Customer Evaluation survey to help improve the systems.

Getting started at a military pharmacy

Are you considering filling your next prescription at a military pharmacy? If you do, you won’t have copayments for prescriptions, as described in the TRICARE Costs and Fees Fact Sheet. You can even have your civilian provider send your prescriptions to a miliary pharmacy.

Each military pharmacy operates slightly differently, so call ahead and ask the pharmacy a few questions:

My provider is going to e-prescribe my medication. What is this pharmacy’s name?

If my civilian provider wants to e-prescribe and they’ve never worked with a military pharmacy before, what can I tell them to make it easier?

Do you have my medication in stock?

How far in advance should I request refills? (Military pharmacies can’t always process same-day refill requests. Some pharmacies ask for 48-72 hours’ notice.)

Do you participate in Q-Anywhere and ScriptCenter? If so, tell me if anything is unique to this location.",https://media.defense.gov/2025/Jul/22/2003758646/1920/1080/0/250625-N-TW242-1006.JPG,N,0.0,2025-07-22 13:05:50.213639

— Mark Shandrow, CEO of Asana Recovery

ORANGE COUNTY, CA, UNITED STATES, July 22, 2025 /EINPresswire.com/ -- Asana Recovery, a leading addiction treatment center renowned for its evidence-based and holistic approach to healing, proudly announces its official approval as a TRICARE-authorized provider. This pivotal milestone, secured through its partnership with TriWest Healthcare Alliance, the administrator of TRICARE in the West Region and a key partner in VA Community Care, marks a significant expansion of accessible, high-quality addiction and mental health services for active-duty service members, veterans, and their eligible family members across the Western United States.

For years, Asana Recovery, based in Orange County, California, has been dedicated to restoring lives impacted by substance use disorders and co-occurring mental health conditions. This new authorization under TRICARE, the nationwide healthcare program of the U.S. Department of Defense (DoD), underscores Asana’s unwavering commitment to serving those who have bravely served our nation, along with their families who share in their sacrifices. The approval means that thousands of military beneficiaries in states covered by TriWest Healthcare Alliance, including California, Arizona, Nevada, Oregon, Washington, and many others in the West Region, will now have direct access to Asana’s comprehensive continuum of care.

“This TRICARE approval is more than just a credential; it’s a profound affirmation of our mission and a direct pathway to extend our healing hand to the military community,” stated Mark Shandrow, CEO of Asana Recovery. “We understand the unique challenges faced by service members, veterans, and their families—from the invisible wounds of trauma and operational stress to the complexities of reintegration. Our team is deeply committed to providing the specialized, compassionate care they deserve, ensuring they receive the highest standard of treatment on their journey to lasting recovery.”

TRICARE is a critical lifeline for millions, providing comprehensive healthcare benefits to uniformed service members, retirees, and their families worldwide. TriWest Healthcare Alliance plays an indispensable role in this ecosystem, managing the TRICARE West Region and administering vital components of VA Community Care. This partnership with TriWest is particularly impactful, as it streamlines the process for beneficiaries to access Asana Recovery’s specialized programs, reducing administrative hurdles and ensuring timely intervention.

The need for accessible, specialized addiction and mental health treatment within the military community is more pressing than ever. Service members and veterans often grapple with trauma, PTSD, chronic pain, and the pressures of military life, which can significantly increase the risk of substance use disorders. Asana Recovery’s programs are meticulously designed to address these complex co-occurring conditions through a trauma-informed lens, offering individualized treatment plans that integrate evidence-based therapies, holistic modalities, and a strong focus on relapse prevention and long-term wellness.

Beneficiaries seeking care at Asana Recovery can expect a full spectrum of services, including:

• Partial Hospitalization Programs (PHP) – Step-down care offering robust clinical support with increased flexibility

• Intensive Outpatient Programs (IOP) – Flexible treatment options allowing individuals to integrate recovery into their daily lives

• Outpatient Programs (OP) – Individual and group therapy sessions providing ongoing support for long-term well-being

• Dual Diagnosis Treatment – Integrated care for co-occurring mental health disorders, such as PTSD, anxiety, and depression

• Trauma-Informed Therapy – Specialized approaches to address the root causes of addiction, particularly relevant for military personnel

• Family Therapy and Support – Engaging loved ones in the healing process to foster a strong support system

“Our clinical team is extensively trained in understanding the nuances of military culture and the specific stressors that can contribute to addiction,” added Jonathan Hagen, Executive Director. “We are proud to offer a safe, confidential, and empathetic environment where TRICARE beneficiaries can heal, rebuild, and reclaim their lives with dignity and respect. This approval significantly enhances our ability to reach those who need our help most.”

Asana Recovery’s commitment to excellence is reflected in its personalized approach, small client-to-staff ratios, and serene environment conducive to healing. The facility is equipped to provide the highest level of care, ensuring that each individual receives the tailored support necessary for sustainable recovery. This TRICARE authorization represents a pivotal step in bridging the gap between the critical need for specialized addiction treatment and the availability of high-quality services for our nation’s heroes and their families.

Walter Reed National Military Medical Center’s Pediatric Primary Care and Adolescent and Young Adult (AYA) Medicine clinics are here to help with routine wellness visits and acute care needs for patients from birth through age 25. These clinics offer flexible appointment options, including early bird, evening, Saturday, and virtual visits – making it easier for busy families to fit in the care their children need.

Support a Healthy School Year

For a smooth transition into the classroom, it’s important that children and teens are up to date on wellness exams and immunizations. It is just as critical to make sure they are getting adequate sleep, nutritious meals, regular physical activity, play time, and healthy limits on screen time.

“Plan healthy lunches that include proteins, fruits, veggies, and most importantly, foods your child likes to eat!” said U.S. Army Lt. Col. (Dr.) Elizabeth Simmons, chief of Pediatric Primary Care at Walter Reed.

Simmons also encourages families to explore the Healthy Habits program designed for children ages 6-18 who may benefit from support developing weight-management routines.

“Although the focus is on the child, the program is an all-inclusive effort to help the entire family become healthier. Healthy Habits are changes for life!” she said. “We encourage kids to keep regular routines to minimize back-to-school anxiety. We have behavioral health psychologists on staff who can help if there are any concerns.”

Caring for Teens and Young Adults

The AYA Medicine Clinic sees patients from ages 12-25 and helps bridge the gap between pediatric and adult care.

U.S. Army Maj. (Dr.) Saira Ahmed, service chief for Walter Reed’s AYA Medicine Clinic, highlights the importance of helping teens take charge of their health.

“[We recommend] promoting medical autonomy for adolescents and young adults — getting them ready for adulthood when they must start managing their own health care. We can also help with issues related to academic performance, screen time, and safety and injury prevention,” Ahmed said.

If your child has had a well visit in the past 12 months, school forms can be submitted through the patient portal without scheduling an additional appointment. It is advised, however, to check with your child’s school as some paperwork may require updated immunizations or physicals.

What to Cover Before School Starts

Well visits are a good time to check on your child’s:

Growth (height, weight, blood pressure, and cholesterol)

School and sports readiness

Mental and emotional well-being

Medications and refills

Healthy habits and nutrition goals

For teens and young adults, providers may also cover:

Puberty and development changes

Cervical cancer screenings (females ages 21-25)

Birth control and reproductive health

Immunizations by age:

Age 4: DTaP (diphtheria-tetanus-pertussis), IPV (polio), MMR (measles-mumps-rubella), Varicella (chickenpox)

Age 9: HPV series (human papilloma)

Age 11: HPV, Men ACWY #1 (meningitis), Tdap (tetanus-diphtheria-pertussis)

Age 16: Men ACWY #2 (meningitis booster)

Ages 16-18: Men B series

Running July 21 through Aug. 2, the exercise will include military and civilian emergency response fixed and rotary wing aircraft. UC25 involves more than 1,000 military and civilian personnel, including teams from 21 civilian hospitals and representatives from the Department of Veterans Affairs, Department of Health and Human Services, and the Defense Health Agency.

“Ultimate Caduceus underscores our commitment to delivering world-class care and rapid evacuation for our military,” said Air Force Col. Christopher Backus, USTRANSCOM command surgeon. “With our government and civilian partners, we stand ready to bring our warfighters home, no matter where they are.”

This year’s activities include both virtual and in-person training around:

--Albuquerque, New Mexico

--Joint Base Pearl Harbor-Hickam, Hawaii

--Honolulu, Hawaii

--Sacramento, California

--Travis Air Force Base, California

--Scott Air Force Base, Illinois

A portion of UC25 focuses on engaging a National Defense Medical System pilot program, actively testing how all the emergency response systems work together to save lives during a potential national crisis.

Ultimate Caduceus exercises have been focused on troop patient transfer from the Indo-Pacific in the past, as well as patient movement from the Middle East and Europe.

As the DOD’s sole manager for global patient movement, USTRANSCOM leads aeromedical evacuation missions using high-capacity aircraft and en route care teams to transport personnel from the field to definitive care anywhere in the world.

I’m adhering to my military branch’s instructions on keeping physically fit and eating nutritiously, but I’m having trouble getting rid of some excess pounds from my last duty station, where I mostly sat at a desk. How can I lose those pounds in a healthy way?

Sincerely,

U.S. Air Force Major G. Luke Gagon

--

To achieve optimum body weight composition (your fit-to-fat ratio) you’ll need to commit to regular exercise and a nutritious diet. Should these lifestyle changes not result in reaching your fitness goals, you may consider discussing weight-loss treatment options with your healthcare provider, including medications that may be appropriate for your specific medical needs and TRICARE coverage.

That’s the message from Dr. Marc Alaric Franzos, a cardiologist at the Uniformed Services University in Bethesda, Maryland. He emphasizes regular physical activity and a heart-healthy Mediterranean-style diet for maximum physical fitness and overall health.

--

“Lifestyle modification is relatively straightforward. It's exactly what you would expect—move more, eat less, and sleep well,” Franzos said. Ideally, service members should aim for cardiovascular health that includes “at least 150 minutes, maybe up to 300 minutes of moderate exertion, aerobic activity per week,” said Franzos. “If you're doing vigorous exercise where you're getting up into heart rate zones above 85% [of maximum], you can actually cut it down to 75 to 150 minutes per week, but ultimately that means you're still moving quite a bit, and that's a minimum.”

“Regular, vigorous exercise where you can’t carry on a conversation can be hard to maintain session-to-session, so most of your effort should be in the moderate zones.” Franzos. “It can even include walking if you walk briskly.” This weight-bearing exercise helps “maintain the muscle on the bones, but also the bones themselves,” because you want to “avoid osteoporosis, or thinning out of the bones.”

“Diet can be used for comfort, it can be used for celebration, it can be used for friendship, but it's also important to recognize that it's fuel,” for the warfighter, said Franzos.

The Trouble with Losing Weight is Keeping it Off

Losing excess weight is hard to begin with, but so is keeping it off, Franzos said.

When lifestyle modifications don't achieve desired results, MHS beneficiaries who struggle with weight loss should discuss treatment options with their healthcare providers. Treatment approaches may include medications that are appropriate for their specific medical conditions and covered under their TRICARE benefit. Coverage for weight management medications varies based on medical indication and TRICARE enrollment status.

""Healthcare providers are best positioned to evaluate individual patient needs and determine appropriate treatment options, including newer medications that may be available,"" Franzos noted. ""Traditional weight-loss medicines have typically achieved modest results, with some newer treatments showing improved effectiveness when combined with lifestyle changes.""

‘Trust in Your Military Health System’ and Don’t Go It Alone

Franzos cautioned strongly against service members or other beneficiaries ordering medications via mail or from outside the U.S., especially as alternatives to proper medical supervision or because of concerns about treatment access.

“It's just too easy to order something mail order and end up getting a product that may not even contain any GLP-1ra,” Franzos said, but instead, “it may contain other substances which could be very hazardous to your health.”

“I would tell our service members to have trust in your Military Health System, and make an appointment with your primary care doctor, to discuss options and determine if it’s a good option for you.” Military sports medicine and obesity medicine specialists are also available, he noted.

“We've taken a lot of effort to learn about it and ensure that we can give proper counseling, proper guidance, and monitor for the adverse effects that may come up from these medications,” Franzo said.

“But I guarantee you that the first thing out of your doctor’s mouth is going to be, ‘Let me talk to you about lifestyle modification,’ and they're going to reinforce that, and they're going to want you to prove to them that you've taken genuine efforts on that front for about three to six months.”

Thanks to Dr. Franzos for his guidance on how to lose weight safely, be physically fit, and stay heart healthy at the same time.

Major, now is the time to get your weight checked and look for other possible causes of weight gain besides inactivity and unhealthy foods.

For more information, check out these resources, and remember, stay safe out there. We want you and your teammates to stay fit and in fighting shape.

So, the only way to have tricare as primary based on what you've shared would be to drop your father's plan.

Tricare is a payer of last resort (with few exceptions that don’t apply here). You cannot drop the parent’s insurance until open enrollment, unless you have a qualifying life event.

Primary vs. secondary is never a matter of choice - there are always rules that apply.

Tricare is almost always secondary since they pay after all commercial health insurance except certain governmental payors such as Medicaid, Tricare supplementary plans, and some other govt payors. However, if your spouse had a UHC and your dad had a UHC (commercial plans) then your spouses would be primary over you being a dependent under your parent.

For the birthday rule, it generally applies to coverage if you're a dependent on your parents such as covered under mom and dad's if parents are married.

Edit: If you remove dad's UHC, Tricare would be the only health insurance and would be primary.

Edit: not sure what wires got crossed in my head when writing this and not reading it over again before hitting reply, but everyone else so far is right. Tricare will be secondary to anything that isn’t Medicaid or Medicare.",,N,0.0,2025-07-21 19:56:45.677821

More than innovation—a culture shift The Innovation Fellowship Program is designed to improve patient care and streamline operations.
“DHA leaders are investing in frontline staff and the future of military health care.","The Defense Health Agency is making a concerted effort to identify health system innovations from a particular group of the workforce: our frontline staff.

With the launch of the Innovation Fellowship Program, DHA is empowering civilian and uniformed employees at military hospitals and clinics to solve real-world problems they face every day—by offering time, funding, and a network of mentors to help bring their ideas to life.

This program flips the script on other top-down initiatives that may miss critical on-the-ground context. “Far too often, enterprise innovations overlook the lived experience of frontline staff,” said Dr. Rebecca Rough, chief innovation officer of DHA. “This program recognizes true innovations start with those closest to the problem.”

Turning ideas into action

Prospective fellows are invited to submit “pitches” to target specific issues in their daily work. Selected fellows receive financial support to explore and test solutions and are granted twelve months with up to 25% of their work time protected to focus on their projects. Financial backing includes up to $10,000 for training and concept changes, and as much as $150,000 to develop and test prototypes.

But support doesn’t stop at funding. Fellows work with subject matter experts and mentors from across the DHA enterprise to help refine, implement, and potentially scale their ideas.

More than innovation—a culture shift

The Innovation Fellowship Program is designed to improve patient care and streamline operations. More importantly, it fosters a culture where everyday problem-solvers are inspired to lead change.

“DHA leaders are investing in frontline staff and the future of military health care. This program is designed to improve the system and enable to make a tangible difference,” said Dr. Pauline Swiger, the fellowship’s program director.

By providing structure, resources, and a pathway to innovate, DHA hopes to unlock creative potential at all levels of the organization—and demonstrate good ideas don’t need to come from the top to make a big impact.

“This program is just as much about inspiring and engaging the innovators out there on the ground as it is about the innovation itself” said U.S. Army Major Taylor Neuman, acting chief workforce well-being and engagement officer of DHA.

Whatever direction Louisiana pharmacy benefit manager reform takes, I hope we continue to focus on what works — and who it really works for.","As chairman of the Louisiana Independent Pharmacies Association, I’ve heard all sides of the debate over pharmacy benefit managers and their role in our industry. And lately, since Louisiana lawmakers discussed banning pharmacy benefit managers from owning their own pharmacies, I’ve heard arguments that such a ban would somehow harm military families, especially those who use Tricare.

But those arguments overlook a simple fact: for many military families, access to quality pharmaceutical care is already broken, and the pharmacy benefit managers helped break it.

The original purpose of these corporate middlemen was to negotiate drug prices and help lower costs. But today, companies like Express Scripts — a Cigna Group-owned company that has held the exclusive Tricare pharmacy contract since 2009 — use their unmatched power to control both the benefit and the pharmacy. They steer patients into their own mail-order operations like Accredo, a subsidiary of Express Scripts, reaping immense profits at the expense of locally operated, small-business pharmacies.

Consider that in August 2022 alone, more than 15,000 pharmacies left the Tricare network after the pharmacy benefit managers offered reimbursement contracts that didn’t even cover the cost of dispensing medication. That shift impacted more than 400,000 military families who were forced to choose between going out of network and paying higher costs or using PBM-owned mail-order pharmacies that offer little to no customer support and are prone to delays.

So when critics worry that if Louisiana were to restrict PBM pharmacy ownership, it would cause pharmacy closures and disrupt veteran care, I shake my head. It is the pharmacy benefit managers — not independent pharmacies — that are already doing this by forcing providers out of the Tricare network and reimbursing non-PBM competitors — our brick-and-mortar small businesses — at such insignificant rates that they cannot survive. It’s a system designed to limit access exclusively to the benefit of the pharmacy benefit manager.

What often gets lost in these conversations is what care actually looks like at the community level. Despite these network restrictions, Tricare patients still walk into Louisiana’s independently operated pharmacies seeking care because of the poor service they’ve experienced at the hands of the PBM mail-order pharmacy. Their medications may be lost, delayed indefinitely or spoiled in transit, and they’ve grown tired of trying to get help through a distant PBM call center. In some cases, these patients are happy to go out of network and pay out of pocket because the cash price is lower than what Express Scripts would charge. They choose local care not only because it costs less, but because it’s safer, faster and more personal.

Fortunately, the more than 600 independent pharmacies throughout Louisiana stand ready and able to serve our veterans and military families — if only the system would let us. We have the training and the community relationships to provide high-quality care. But as long as pharmacy benefit managers are allowed to both set the reimbursement rate and steer patients to their own pharmacies, we’ll never have the chance to compete fairly.

At the Louisiana Independent Pharmacies Association, we’re happy that Gov. Jeff Landry and state legislators are having meaningful conversations about reform, and we are eager to be part of a solution that provides all patients fair prices, local access and better care. We think the best solution will be built on access, transparency and real accountability — not vertical integration and self-dealing.

Walter Reed National Military Medical Center’s Pediatric Primary Care and Adolescent and Young Adult (AYA) Medicine clinics are here to help with routine wellness visits and acute care needs for patients from birth through age 25. These clinics offer flexible appointment options, including early bird, evening, Saturday, and virtual visits – making it easier for busy families to fit in the care their children need.

For more details on appointment options for each clinic, visit walterreed.tricare.mil/Health-Services/Primary-Care/Pediatric-Adolescent-and-Young-Adult-Medicine/Adolescent-Young-Adult-Medicine, and visit walterreed.tricare.mil/Health-Services/Primary-Care/Pediatric-Adolescent-and-Young-Adult-Medicine/Pediatric-Primary-Care-Clinic.

Support a Healthy School Year

For a smooth transition into the classroom, it’s important that children and teens are up to date on wellness exams and immunizations. It is just as critical to make sure they are getting adequate sleep, nutritious meals, regular physical activity, play time, and healthy limits on screen time.

“Plan healthy lunches that include proteins, fruits, veggies, and most importantly, foods your child likes to eat!” said U.S. Army Lt. Col. (Dr.) Elizabeth Simmons, chief of Pediatric Primary Care at Walter Reed.

Simmons also encourages families to explore the Healthy Habits program designed for children ages 6-18 who may benefit from support developing weight-management routines.

“Although the focus is on the child, the program is an all-inclusive effort to help the entire family become healthier. Healthy Habits are changes for life!” she said. “We encourage kids to keep regular routines to minimize back-to-school anxiety. We have behavioral health psychologists on staff who can help if there are any concerns.”

Caring for Teens and Young Adults

The AYA Medicine Clinic sees patients from ages 12-25 and helps bridge the gap between pediatric and adult care.

U.S. Army Maj. (Dr.) Saira Ahmed, service chief for Walter Reed’s AYA Medicine Clinic, highlights the importance of helping teens take charge of their health.

“[We recommend] promoting medical autonomy for adolescents and young adults — getting them ready for adulthood when they must start managing their own health care. We can also help with issues related to academic performance, screen time, and safety and injury prevention,” Ahmed said.

If your child has had a well visit in the past 12 months, school forms can be submitted through the patient portal without scheduling an additional appointment. It is advised, however, to check with your child’s school as some paperwork may require updated immunizations or physicals.

What to Cover Before School Starts

Well visits are a good time to check on your child’s:

• Growth (height, weight, blood pressure, and cholesterol)

• School and sports readiness

• Mental and emotional well-being

• Medications and refills

• Healthy habits and nutrition goals

For teens and young adults, providers may also cover:

• Puberty and development changes

• Cervical cancer screenings (females ages 21-25)

• Birth control and reproductive health

Immunizations by age:

• Age 4: DTaP (diphtheria-tetanus-pertussis), IPV (polio), MMR

(measles-mumps-rubella), Varicella (chickenpox)

• Age 9: HPV series (human papilloma)

• Age 11: HPV, Men ACWY #1 (meningitis), Tdap (tetanus-diphtheria-pertussis)

• Age 16: Men ACWY #2 (meningitis booster)

• Ages 16-18: Men B series

Senior leaders from the Defense Health Agency (DHA), which manages medical facilities, stated they anticipate substantial shortfalls in military medical personnel until at least 2027 when personnel levels may increase.
To help address facility staffing challenges, DHA and the military departments implemented a collaborative process to staff medical facilities with military medical personnel.
Health Affairs, DHA, and the military departments have taken steps to monitor the available work time of military medical personnel in medical facilities.
Senate Report 118-58 includes a provision for GAO to review military medical personnel staffing at DOD medical facilities.","What GAO Found

The number of military medical positions and assigned personnel in Department of Defense (DOD) medical facilities has declined over time. Specifically, the number of authorized positions for military medical personnel declined by nearly 7 percent (63,179 to 58,945) from fiscal year 2015 through fiscal year 2023. Likewise, assigned personnel declined by about 16 percent (60,479 to 50,590) during the same time. The decline in assigned personnel is in part attributable to fewer medical personnel in the Army, Navy, and Air Force (military departments). Senior leaders from the Defense Health Agency (DHA), which manages medical facilities, stated they anticipate substantial shortfalls in military medical personnel until at least 2027 when personnel levels may increase.

To help address facility staffing challenges, DHA and the military departments implemented a collaborative process to staff medical facilities with military medical personnel. Pursuant to 2024 guidance from the Office of the Assistant Secretary of Defense for Health Affairs (Health Affairs), DHA prioritized vacancies by facility and occupation, and the military departments identified personnel to fill them in 2025. DHA and the military departments are also collaborating to update medical facility personnel requirements for future years.

Health Affairs, DHA, and the military departments have taken steps to monitor the available work time of military medical personnel in medical facilities. The parties also agreed on how much time personnel would be expected to work in a facility as opposed to other military duties. These expectations vary depending on whether personnel are assigned exclusively to a facility.

Military Medical Personnel Categories and Annual Expected Medical Facility Work Time

To help ensure DOD meets these expectations, Health Affairs developed a monitoring tool that compares actual and expected work time by using medical facility timecard data from DHA. However, the monitoring tool is missing key information and relies on inaccurate and incomplete data. Specifically, the tool does not make key distinctions between facility work time and other time (e.g., deployments) or among personnel categories (e.g., exclusive vs. dual-assigned). Further, the tool relies on inaccurate and incomplete timecard data because DHA does not have a communication strategy, geared toward military medical personnel, that clarifies the importance of filling out timecards accurately, among other things. Until Health Affairs evaluates which activities count as facility work time in the tool and DHA communicates the importance of accurate timecard data, DOD will not have complete information to better monitor military medical personnel staffing at facilities.

Why GAO Did This Study

In 2023, DOD announced that its roughly 700 medical facilities have been chronically understaffed in recent years. The facilities are staffed primarily with military medical personnel and augmented with DOD civilian employees and private contractor employees.

Senate Report 118-58 includes a provision for GAO to review military medical personnel staffing at DOD medical facilities. This report describes (1) trends in military medical personnel staffing at the facilities from fiscal year 2015 through fiscal year 2023; and evaluates the extent to which DOD has (2) a collaborative facility staffing process, and (3) taken steps to monitor the availability of personnel to work in medical facilities, among other things.

GAO reviewed DOD guidance and documentation and analyzed personnel data for fiscal years 2015 through 2023 and timecard data for fiscal year 2023. GAO also interviewed DOD officials and nearly 350 personnel from six medical facilities selected for site visits based on military department affiliation, location, and size.",https://www.gao.gov/themes/custom/gao_uswds/dist/gao-img/gao-gov-icon-800-mod.jpg,N,0.0,2025-07-21 11:56:14.855766

In addition, FraudNet supported over 50 internal requests for support from GAO teams conducting audits and investigations.

Why This Matters

FraudNet’s primary mission is to facilitate the reporting of alleged fraud, waste, abuse, and mismanagement involving federal funds. It also supports GAO audits and investigations. This is the overview of FraudNet’s activities for fiscal year 2024.

FraudNet Processed over 5,780 Allegations in Fiscal Year 2024

Complainants, which can include the public, government employees and contractors, submitted over 5,780 allegations to FraudNet in fiscal year 2024. As shown in the figure below, the number of allegations FraudNet processed in fiscal year 2024 was higher than prior years, with the exception of fiscal year 2022. In fiscal year 2022, more than half of the allegations received were associated with social media campaigns that resulted in multiple complainants submitting form letters alleging the same fraud. This type of allegation was not prevalent in fiscal year 2024.

Allegations in fiscal year 2024 included those complainants categorized as mismanagement, waste, or misappropriation of government funds; ethics/conflict of interest/misconduct; false statements/claims; and embezzlement.

FraudNet’s Investigative Research Analysts review and document every allegation received. If FraudNet analysts determine an allegation should be referred elsewhere, possibly for investigation, they send it to federal Offices of the Inspector General (OIG) or other federal, state, and local entities as appropriate. Those entities then determine whether and how they will address an allegation.

Of the total allegations received in fiscal year 2024, FraudNet referred over 2,100 allegations to approximately 60 entities. These included the Department of Justice, and OIGs at the Department of Defense and the Treasury. For over 270 allegations, complainants indicated that they had sent the same allegation to entities other than GAO, and there were also approximately 590 complaints that were flagged as duplicates by FraudNet analysts. In such instances, FraudNet generally did not refer the allegation to those other entities to avoid duplicating efforts

FraudNet Analysts Provided Research Support to GAO Audits and Investigations

In fiscal year 2024, FraudNet analysts supported over 50 requests from GAO teams conducting audits and investigations. These requests involved analysts researching individuals and businesses.

For example, FraudNet analysts obtained publicly available information to support a GAO audit related to TRICARE Network providers. The Department of Defense's TRICARE program offers health care to more than 9 million beneficiaries through DOD healthcare facilities and private healthcare providers. (GAO-24-106434). FraudNet’s work helped GAO auditors identify practicing providers who had limited credentials, revoked credentials, and were ineligible to work for the TRICARE Network.

Anyone can contact FraudNet’s hotline to report suspected fraud, waste, abuse, or mismanagement of federal funds. The internet-based Complaint Form is the preferred reporting method. GAO cannot accept classified information via the website – please call (1-800-424-5454) for further guidance for allegations involving classified information.

When complainants submit an allegation through FraudNet’s website, they have the option to select the category that they think best describes their allegation. This selection can help FraudNet analysts evaluate allegations. The categories can also inform overall trend analysis. When FraudNet receives an allegation, the analysts do not edit or change it. Rather the analysts evaluate the allegation and, in some instances, follow up with the complainants for more information. The analysts then may determine that referral to another entity is appropriate. See the graphic below for good practices to follow when filing an allegation with FraudNet. GAO does not independently investigate allegations of fraud, waste, or abuse. However, FraudNet documents all allegations received in its case management system and makes them available to inform any ongoing or future GAO work.",https://www.gao.gov/themes/custom/gao_uswds/dist/gao-img/gao-gov-icon-800-mod.jpg,N,0.0,2025-07-21 11:56:17.265483

At New York Dental Clinic, a leading Daegu dental clinic, we specialize in early-stage cavity detection and minimally invasive treatment that preserves your natural tooth and protects your long-term oral health.

Whether it’s your first cavity or a recurring issue under an old filling, we use advanced diagnostic tools and aesthetic materials to restore your smile quickly, safely, and painlessly.

🦠 What Is a Cavity?

A cavity (or dental caries) is the result of tooth enamel breakdown caused by acid-producing bacteria. This acid forms when sugars and carbohydrates combine with plaque on the tooth surface. If not addressed, it can eat through the enamel, spread into the dentin, and eventually reach the nerve, causing infection, pain, and tooth loss.

✅ Signs You May Have a Cavity:

Sensitivity to hot, cold, or sweets

A visible hole or dark spot on the tooth

Pain when chewing or biting down

Bad breath or an unpleasant taste

Roughness or food getting stuck in certain areas

Even if you don’t feel pain, cavities can silently progress. That’s why regular checkups at New York Dental are critical for early detection.
