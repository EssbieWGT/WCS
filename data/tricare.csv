Specifically, the canceled contracts include $1.8 billion in consulting, $1.4 billion enterprise cloud IT services and a $500 million Navy contract for business process consulting.
""That's with a 'B' -- $5.1 billion in DOD contracts for ancillary things like consulting and other nonessential services,"" Hegseth said in a video Thursday from his office at the Pentagon, calling the contracts non-essential spending.
""If you're keeping score at home, today's cuts bring our running total to nearly $6 billion in wasteful spending over the first six weeks of the Department of Government Efficiency effort here at the Defense Department,"" Hegseth said.
There are 2.1 million people working for the Department of Defense, roughly 950,000 of whom are non-uniformed civilians.","April 12 (UPI) -- Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth this week signed a memorandum cutting $5.1 billion in consulting contracts at the Pentagon, calling them ""wasteful.""

The memo's subject line Thursday was ""Continuing Elimination of Wasteful Spending of the DoD.""

The memo, signed on Thursday, canceled Defense Health Agency contracts for consulting services from Accenture, Deloitte and Booz Allen, among other firms, as well as an Air Force contract with Accenture to resell third-party enterprise cloud IT services.

Specifically, the canceled contracts include $1.8 billion in consulting, $1.4 billion enterprise cloud IT services and a $500 million Navy contract for business process consulting.

Hegseth said the work can be performed by the Pentagon's civil workforce.

""That's with a 'B' -- $5.1 billion in DOD contracts for ancillary things like consulting and other nonessential services,"" Hegseth said in a video Thursday from his office at the Pentagon, calling the contracts non-essential spending.

Hegseth directed the DOD chief information officer, in coordination with the Department of Government Efficiency, to prepare a plan within 30 days for how the department will in-source IT consulting and management services to its civilian workforce and negotiate most favorable rates on software and cloud services.

""We need this money to spend on better health care for our warfighters and their families, instead of $500 an hour business process consultant,"" he said in a statement announcing the cuts. ""That's a lot of consulting.""

He also noted cutting a $500 million contract to the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency for IT help desk services that are ""completely duplicative"" of services that the Defense Information Systems Agency already provides.

In addition, the Pentagon is cutting 11 contracts related to diversity, equity and inclusion, climate change, the department's response to the COVID-19 pandemic and related nonessential activities across the DOD.

He also announced pausing $500 million in funding to two universities -- Northwestern University and Cornell -- that ""tolerate antisemitism and support divisive DEI programs."" This is in addition to the $70 million already cut at Columbia, Penn, Brown and Princeton in past weeks.

Hegseth attended Princeton and Harvard.

""We are committed to rooting out DEI -- root and branch -- throughout this department ... I'm going to keep looking,"" Hegseth said.

The memo said $4 million can be directed to ""re-allocate to our mission-critical priorities to Revive the Warrior Ethos, Rebuild the Military, and Reestablish Deterrence.""

On March 20, he announced $580 million would be cut in programs, contracts and grants.

""If you're keeping score at home, today's cuts bring our running total to nearly $6 billion in wasteful spending over the first six weeks of the Department of Government Efficiency effort here at the Defense Department,"" Hegseth said.

On Feb. 20, Hegseth first announced that DOGE would be working on cutting excess and refocusing the department's budget.

""We're excited to make these cuts on behalf of you, the taxpayer and the warfighters here at the department,"" he said.

On March, 29, he directed the Pentagon to reduce its civilian workforce by 5% to 8 percent over the next several months. This would total 50,000 to 60,000 jobs.

This can be done through early retirement and buyouts with full pay and benefits until Sept. 30. Also probationary workers with less than two years on the job have been let go from federal agencies.

A hiring freeze was ordered on Feb. 28 by Hegseth after President Donald Trump issued a broad civilian hiring freeze over most of the federal government on his first day in office on Jan. 20 as part of efforts to slash the size of the government.

In the DoD, there are some exceptions, including 18 classes of jobs. They include teaching positions at Department of Defense Education Activity schools and on-post day care, medical facilities, immigration enforcement, public safety, recruiting and readiness.

Zynex’s Disappointing Fourth Quarter Results

ZYXI share price depression stems from its disastrous 4Q 2024 earnings release. The Englewood, Colorado-based firm reported fourth-quarter 2024 revenue of $46.0 million, a roughly 2% year-over-year decline, falling short of Wall Street's expectations. The company also swung to a net loss of $0.02 per share, a stark contrast to the $0.04 net income per share reported in the same period last year.

The disappointing results reportedly prompted RBC Capital Markets to downgrade Zynex to Sector Perform from Outperform. According to news outlets, in a report to its clients, RBC analyst Shagun Singh cited a ""lack of visibility"" into the company's operations and commercial outlook, particularly concerning its relationship with Tricare, the military health program that represents a significant portion of Zynex's revenue.

Singh reportedly noted that Tricare, Zynex's largest customer, has temporarily suspended payments amid an ongoing review of prior claims. Singh added that the company's decision to withhold 2025 guidance and implement a 15% workforce reduction further compounded investor concerns. Singh revised RBC’s price target for Zynex shares to $5.50, down from $11.00, warning of a potential ""domino effect"" stemming from Tricare's payment suspension.

Zynex Securities Class Action

Adding to Zynex’s woes, a securities class action lawsuit has been filed in the District Court of Colorado, alleging that the company made false and misleading statements regarding its revenue recognition practices and its relationship with Tricare. The suit, captioned Tuncel v. Zynex, Inc., et al., seeks to represent investors who purchased Zynex securities between March 13, 2023, and March 11, 2025.

The complaint alleges that Zynex engaged in “oversupplying” customers with products, including electrodes, leading to inflated revenue figures. It further claims that this practice drew scrutiny from insurers, including Tricare, and that Zynex failed to disclose the potential for adverse consequences, such as removal from insurer networks and government penalties.

According to the complaint, revelations of Zynex's alleged practices surfaced with a June 4, 2024 report by medical journal STAAT detailing an ""oversupplying scheme"" involving excessive shipments of supplies and subsequent inflated billing. The report also indicated that insurers were ""kicking the company out of network.""

The truth allegedly emerged on March 11, 2025, when Zynex reported its dismal Q4 and FY 2024 financial results. The complaint highlights Zynex CEO Thomas Sandgaard’s attributing the fourth-quarter revenue shortfall to ""slower than normal payments from certain payers"" and the Tricare payment suspension.

Hagens Berman’s Investigation

Hagens Berman is investigating the alleged claims. “We are examining Zynex's financial reporting and business practices. We believe investors deserve a complete and transparent understanding of these events,” said Reed Kathrein, the Hagens Berman Partner leading the firm's probe.

,,2025-04-12 14:33:38+00:00,The Virginian-Pilot,"Critical veteran mental health care at risk due to Tricare payment issues, clinicians say",Gavin Stone,,,,,https://www.pilotonline.com/2025/04/12/veteran-mental-health-tricare-issues/,"The stalled payments are apparently the result of a change to Tricare’s billing processing system that began Jan. 1.
Without being paid, the clinics either have to stop providing services to clients with Tricare coverage or are asking their clients to pay out of pocket.
“Upon checking with our Tricare (subject-matter experts), we’ve learned that Tricare regulations and policy governing LPCs have not changed,” the spokesperson said.
Staton sent out an urgent request for data on April 4 from its members on this issue with Tricare.
Of 19 anonymous responses shared with The Pilot, representatives of different clinics reported a total of 977 patients being impacted by this change, for an average of 51 patients per responding clinic.","Health care providers serving veterans and their families across Virginia say they are missing thousands of dollars — with some having already gone out of business or are close to it — due to Tricare insurance reimbursements being stalled for months, leaving clients without critical mental health services.

The stalled payments are apparently the result of a change to Tricare’s billing processing system that began Jan. 1. Under the new system, licensed professional counselors must meet a series of new requirements or have a medical doctor sign off on their claims in order to be reimbursed, according to reports from clinicians and email chains between clinicians and Tricare provided to The Virginian-Pilot and Daily Press.

Without being paid, the clinics either have to stop providing services to clients with Tricare coverage or are asking their clients to pay out of pocket.

This change particularly affects Virginia because it has such strict standards for its licensed counselors and it has never before required oversight from a medical doctor, according to Melinda Staton, a licensed counselor and the acting president of the Hampton Roads Counseling Association.

In trying to resolve these issues, clinics and their clients have been met with inconsistent messaging from Tricare, according to responses to a request for data on the issue by the Hampton Roads Counseling Association. In an email to The Pilot on Wednesday, a spokesperson for Tricare denied any change had taken place and did not address a follow-up question about whether payments had been stalled.

“Upon checking with our Tricare (subject-matter experts), we’ve learned that Tricare regulations and policy governing LPCs have not changed,” the spokesperson said.

Staton sent out an urgent request for data on April 4 from its members on this issue with Tricare. Of 19 anonymous responses shared with The Pilot, representatives of different clinics reported a total of 977 patients being impacted by this change, for an average of 51 patients per responding clinic.

One clinic reported as many as 261 patients being affected, while four reported less than four patients affected, including one clinic that reported that while reimbursements had been delayed for about three months, they’d had zero clients impacted because “we keep seeing them and currently, we are getting payments.”

These same respondents reported losses totaling at least $175,000 for an average of about $9,210 each. Some of the respondents did not know the exact financial impact, but one said they knew it was “tens of thousands of dollars.”

In response to the request for data, many reported failed attempts to get an explanation from Tricare with some reportedly being told Tricare was experiencing “system errors” or facing a “backlogs and policy changes.”

“In the short term, we need for those clinics that have not been paid to get paid yesterday,” Staton said. “In the long term, we need policy change in the Tricare manual stating that residents can be used, especially if they’re being supervised by a fully licensed professional counselor.”

Staton said she’s aware of at least two clinics that have closed in recent months due to unpaid reimbursements from Tricare. It’s unclear how many clients have been impacted.

Meichell Worthing, a licensed professional counselor and owner of Lighthouse Counseling and Psychotherapy in Virginia Beach, said about 25% of their clients are Tricare beneficiaries and have stopped taking on new clients covered by Tricare due to the uncertainty.

Beth Hunter, a licensed counselor with Lighthouse, said one of her long-term clients who has struggled with suicidal ideation for years left her office in tears after she described the situation with Tricare.

“When I had to inform her that we have not been paid and that she has options of getting a doctor’s referral … or she could pay out of pocket, which she can’t afford to do, she just left my office in tears saying ‘I don’t know what I’ll do,’” Hunter said. “She didn’t want to continue services for my sake because she knew I wasn’t going to get paid but also for fear that what if Tricare never pays and then she’s stuck with the bill for all these months of services?”

The next day, Hunter said the client emailed her saying, “I can’t survive without therapy.”

Staton said research shows military service members in the first year of transitioning to civilian life don’t get some form of mental health care within the first year of leaving the military they are unlikely to seek it in the future, which leads to an increase in the suicide rate.

“There’s no rocket science here, it’s going to negatively affect (veterans). … If there’s a barrier to access it can be fatal,” Staton said.

The contract cuts come amid an escalating attack on consulting groups by the General Services Administration (GSA), which helps coordinate government acquisitions.

The Secretary stated, “That’s the big win here.","The Pentagon has terminated $4 billion in IT services contracts with companies such as Deloitte, Accenture, and Booz Allen Hamilton as part of the Trump administration’s ongoing liquidation of consulting expenditures.

According to a note released Thursday by Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth, the contracts were identified as “unnecessary expenditures on third-party consultants” that could be handled more efficiently by Pentagon employees.

Hegseth stated that the contracts represented “$5.1 billion in wasteful spending” and that the cancellations would result in “approximately $4 billion in estimated savings.” Over $1 billion has already been paid out.

The Pentagon canceled contracts with Accenture, Deloitte, Booz Allen, and other firms related to the Defense Health Agency and also terminated a separate Air Force contract with Accenture.

Hegseth also ordered the termination of 11 other consulting contracts “supporting Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion (DEI), Climate, Covid-19 response, and other non-essential activities.”

Despite the cuts, US President Donald Trump and Hegseth had earlier this week pledged a $1 million budget for the defense ministry for the first time.

The contract cuts come amid an escalating attack on consulting groups by the General Services Administration (GSA), which helps coordinate government acquisitions.

Last month, ten major firms, including Deloitte, IBM, and Booz Allen, were asked to identify potential savings as part of a “consultant spending review,” but their responses were deemed “demeaning” by the administration.

As a result, the companies were given a new deadline of April 18 to identify further cuts, restructure contracts based on “outcome-based” or “shared savings” models, and offer the federal government a “credit” for revenues the GSA considers excessive during the Biden administration.

Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent stated in a podcast last month that reducing government contractors would be one of the administration’s biggest sources of savings, singling out Booz Allen, which derives almost all of its revenue from government contracts, as one of the companies embroiled in “fraud” allegations.

Booz Allen stated this week that it “welcomes the challenge to create better value” for US taxpayers and that it is “engaging in good faith in a much-needed process to help the government improve efficiency. We look forward to demonstrating our capabilities to the administration.”

The cancellations by Hegseth come as Elon Musk’s Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) increasingly targets what it sees as “outrageous spending” on consulting contracts.

Last week, DOGE lauded the termination of “Google AdWords management” and “global consulting and support services” contracts for the Pacific island nation of Palau.

On Thursday, the GSA also reached an agreement with Google to lower the cost of software and services, including artificial intelligence tools, for the federal government.

The consulting cuts also coincide with a period in which the Pentagon is reducing its civilian workforce by laying off 5% to 8% of employees it deems “not mission-critical.”

US Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth announced that the US and Panama have signed a framework agreement allowing American warships to pass through the Panama Canal with priority and free of charge.

During a press conference evaluating his visit to Panama, Hegseth stated that the two countries are cooperating on border security, combating illegal immigration, fighting drug cartels, and ensuring the security of the Panama Canal, particularly in limiting China’s influence.

Hegseth said, “The US and Panama have signed a memorandum of understanding on common security issues. Following this press conference, we will sign a joint declaration with the Canal Minister on the security and operation of the Panama Canal. This document will form the basis for the free and priority passage of American warships and support vessels through the Panama Canal.”

The Secretary of Defense emphasized that the agreement envisages increasing the number of joint exercises and re-establishing rotational and joint military presence at Fort Sherman, Rodman Naval Base, and Howard Air Force Base.

Additionally, the “Jungle Operations Training Center” at Fort Sherman, which operated from 1953-1999 and prepared soldiers to fight in tropical forests, will be reopened.

Hegseth added, “Our expanded security cooperation will also strengthen engagement in cybersecurity, information sharing, bilateral security dialogues, and the modernization of canal infrastructure.”

Last month, NBC News, citing American officials, reported that the White House had instructed the American military to prepare options regarding the Panama Canal.

Possible plans ranged from closer cooperation with the Panamanian army to the occupation of the canal.

In 1977, US President Jimmy Carter signed an agreement stipulating that control of the canal would be transferred to the Panamanian government in 2000.

The canal was controlled by the US until December 31, 1999. Trump argues that the transfer of the canal to Panama weakened Washington’s position and that Chinese companies have significantly increased their influence over the canal’s infrastructure in recent years.

In early February, he stated that he was confident about regaining control of the canal.

US Secretary of State Marco Rubio also stated that Washington finds it unfair to collect transit fees from the Panama Canal, which US military forces are obliged to defend in the event of a conflict.

In his address to Congress in March, Trump announced that his administration had begun the process of reclaiming the canal.

He stated that a major American company plans to buy two ports around the canal and some other facilities connected to the canal.

According to Trump, the Panama Canal was “built by Americans for Americans, not for others.”

US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent stated today that China’s move to impose retaliatory tariffs of 84% against the US is “unfortunate” and a “losing proposition” for Beijing.

In an interview with Fox Business, Bessent said, “I think it’s unfortunate that the Chinese don’t really want to come and negotiate, because they are the worst offenders in the international trading system.”

Bessent also claimed that allies want to discuss how to rebalance China’s trade policies in talks with US officials.

The Secretary stated, “That’s the big win here. The US is trying to rebalance toward more production. China needs to rebalance toward more consumption.”

Bessent also warned Beijing against trying to devalue its currency in response to the new tariffs.

Bessent said, “If China starts devaluing, that’s a tax on the rest of the world, and everyone has to keep raising their tariffs to offset the devaluation. So I urge them not to do that and to come to the table.”

Not ruling out the removal of Chinese stocks from US stock exchanges, Bessent said that “all options are on the table.”

In an interview with CNBC yesterday, Bessent said, “I think this escalation by China is a big mistake. We are a country with a current account deficit. What do we lose by China raising tariffs against us? We export one-fifth of what they export to us. So this is a losing hand for them.”

Saying that US President Donald Trump will be personally involved in the trade negotiations, Bessent, in response to a question on whether the European Union needs to reduce non-tariff barriers, including value-added taxes, said, “Everything is on the table.”

According to Bloomberg, Apple customers lined up to buy new iPhones, fearing the company might raise prices to offset US President Donald Trump’s tariffs.

Employees at stores across the US said they were bombarded with questions about potential price increases and witnessed customers buying phones in a panic.

Although Apple declined to comment to Bloomberg, retail stores reportedly had higher sales last weekend compared to previous years.

According to a report published by TechInsights, the new tariffs that Trump imposed on Chinese goods mean that the cost of producing an iPhone for Apple could increase from $580 to $850.

Apple will likely avoid immediately raising the price of its flagship product (which it has kept at $999 since 2017), but iPhones account for 50% of its total revenue.

One of the steps Apple could take in this situation is to lobby for exemption from tariffs.

On the other hand, considering that the White House has increased the tariff it applies to China to 104%, it does not seem very likely that an exemption will be granted through China.

Meanwhile, Apple announced that it would temporarily supply more iPhones from India, which faces a tariffs of about a quarter of that of China.

Although the technology giant will probably not completely renew its supply chains, it has been producing some of its products in Vietnam, Ireland, Thailand, and Malaysia for the last few years to reduce its dependence on China.

Despite Trump’s goal of bringing production to the US, it is not realistic to expect Apple factories to open one after the other in the US in the short term. According to Wedbush analyst Dan Ives, moving iPhone production to the US is not only impossible, but could also increase the price of the smartphone to $3,500.",https://harici.com.tr/en/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Pentagon.jpg,N,0.0,2025-04-11 23:56:18.053719

The news, first reported by the Financial Times, highlights what defense officials describe as a broader effort to eliminate what they consider non-essential expenditures on third-party services.

Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth announced the cancellations in a memo issued Thursday, calling the contracts “non-essential spending on third-party consultants” and arguing that much of the work could be done more efficiently by in-house Pentagon staff. Hegseth estimated the cuts would generate nearly $4 billion in savings, despite more than $1 billion already having been spent. He also characterized the total value of the terminated contracts as representing “$5.1 billion in wasteful spending.”

The terminations affect IT and consulting contracts across multiple departments, including the Defense Health Agency and a separate Air Force engagement with Accenture. In addition to the major firms named, 11 other contracts were canceled, many of which were tied to programs supporting Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion (DEI), climate initiatives, and COVID-19 response efforts — areas the administration now deems non-essential.

Despite the aggressive cuts, President Trump and Hegseth earlier this week reaffirmed their commitment to a record-setting $1 trillion defense budget. “The budget will hit $1 trillion and nobody’s seen anything like it,” Trump said during a meeting with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu in the Oval Office on Monday.

The clampdown on consultancy contracts coincides with growing tension between the Trump administration and federal contractors. The General Services Administration (GSA), which oversees federal procurement, has demanded that top consulting firms — including Deloitte, IBM, and Booz Allen — identify significant cost reductions under a “consultant spend review.” The firms were given until April 18 to restructure deals toward “outcome-based” models and issue credits for what the GSA alleges were excessive earnings during the Biden administration.

A source familiar with the review told the Financial Times that responses from several firms were considered “insulting” by senior officials, prompting the GSA to escalate its demands. While the GSA declined to comment on whether the Pentagon cuts were directly tied to this initiative, the overlap in timing suggests a coordinated push.

Booz Allen, which derives most of its revenue from government contracts, has pushed back on the criticism. In a statement this week, the company said it “welcomes the challenge to drive better value” and is participating “in good faith in a much-needed process to assist the government in increasing efficiencies.”

The cuts are also part of a broader campaign by Elon Musk’s so-called Department of Government Efficiency, which has recently targeted a variety of consulting and digital services contracts as wasteful. Last week, the department canceled contracts for Google AdWords management and other global advisory roles, including one supporting the Pacific island nation of Palau.

Separately, the GSA announced a new deal with Google to lower the cost of software and AI services for the federal government.

As part of the cost-saving drive, the Pentagon is also moving to reduce its civilian workforce by 5 to 8 percent, focusing on employees labeled as “not mission-critical.”",https://slguardian.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Pentagon.jpg,N,0.0,2025-04-11 21:56:19.783563

ess there is a reckoning in how the Department of Defense and DHA manage and oversee Tricare, this crisis will continue to unravel our health care benefits.","Member

This has been a huge problem locally and throughout the United States. Doctors not being paid since December of 2024 and patients not being seen. Here is the article:

On Jan. 1, Tricare — the essential health care benefit serving millions of service members, retirees and their families — entered a new cycle of contracts for managing the military’s health care system. This transition, intended to improve efficiency and service, has instead exposed Tricare to systemic failure, mismanagement and what increasingly appears to be gross negligence.

Since the launch, families across the country have experienced a catastrophic disruption in care. Enrollment errors have left beneficiaries uninsured. Surgical procedures have been canceled when hospitals couldn’t verify prior authorization. Chronically ill patients have struggled to find providers to maintain life-sustaining treatment. For many military children with disabilities, years of hard-fought progress are at risk of being erased because therapy appointments were abruptly stopped.

The source of these failures lies not only with the regional contractors — Humana Military (East) and TriWest Healthcare Alliance (West) — but with the Defense Health Agency (DHA), which bears full responsibility for contract oversight and system accountability.

It is clear DHA either ignored the lessons of the past or failed to learn from them. In 2019, the Government Accountability Office (GAO) warned that the previous Tricare transition in 2017 was marred by weaknesses in transition guidance and oversight. GAO’s recommendations were either poorly implemented or ignored — and now military families are paying the price.

Despite having years to prepare for the 2025 transition, similar pitfalls have emerged — only this time, the consequences appear to be broader and deeper.

Many providers across the country have gone unpaid for months, despite submitting claims through systems that should have been validated prior to the start of health care delivery. Claims are being denied or delayed with little to no explanation. Providers — many of them military spouses or veterans — have been forced to dip into personal savings or shut down operations completely. Some have left the Tricare network for good, citing the unreliability and financial harm caused by this transition.

In a recent survey conducted by Mission Alpha Advocacy, families report spending hours on hold with Tricare contractors — only to be disconnected or told to “call back later.” In one case, a retiree reported their surgery had been postponed because Tricare incorrectly claimed they had other health insurance. Another family shared their child’s applied behavior analysis services have stopped due to lack of provider payment since Jan. 1 leaving this parent to worry about loss of progress.” In addition, a beneficiary could not schedule a surgery follow-up because the referral was not processed and the provider refused to accept the DHA referral waiver because of unpaid claims. These stories are not isolated reports; they are the new norm.

The inefficiencies have now compounded into what can be described as a drain on federal and beneficiary resources. Every unpaid claim, every misdirected call and every lost provider equates to a waste of taxpayer dollars. Families report paying more than expected for services that should be covered and are concerned about their financial stability if not reimbursed.

And what has been lost in the chaos is trust. Trust between families and their health care system. Trust between providers and the military medical infrastructure they have long supported. And perhaps most critically, trust between the force and the leaders responsible for ensuring military readiness.

Readiness is not just about aircraft and ammunition. It is about getting troops back to the fight after experiencing an injury — but that can’t happen without access to health care. It is also about families being able to function at home so the service member can focus on the mission. When a child loses critical therapy, when a spouse can’t get prenatal care or when a service member can’t seek timely care to make them deployable — that readiness is compromised.

Resilience — the ability of military families to withstand constant relocations, deployments and separation — relies on predictable support systems. When families move to a new duty station and discover their Tricare benefits are inaccessible, resilience becomes even more difficult.

And retention? It evaporates when military families feel neglected. No incentive pay or patriotic appeal can convince a family to stay if the health care system that serves them is broken beyond repair.

This isn’t just a failed transition. It is a dereliction of duty by those tasked with managing one of the most critical benefits of military life. The military health care system has always been a promise — a pledge to take care of those who serve and their loved ones. That promise has been broken and people’s lives have been negatively impacted.

ess there is a reckoning in how the Department of Defense and DHA manage and oversee Tricare, this crisis will continue to unravel our health care benefits. And with it, the confidence of the very people who keep our nation safe.

According to GovTribe data, Booz Allen has won $345 million in contract obligations at DHA over the last three years.
Another $1.4 billion cut was an Air Force contract held by Accenture to resell enterprise cloud IT services.
It had a $1.6 billion ceiling over five years and was described as cloud reselling contract across multiple cloud services.","The Defense Department says it has found $4 billion in savings by cutting consulting and non-essential contracts with Accenture, Booz Allen Hamilton, Deloitte, and other unnamed companies.

The contracts had a total value of $5.1 billion, according to a DOD memo and a video released of Defense Sec. Pete Hegseth announcing the cuts Thursday night. The cuts are part of the Department of Government Efficiency reviews at DOD.

Of the cuts, $1.8 billion were found at the Defense Health Agency, which involved contracts held by Accenture, Booz Allen, Deloitte and other unnamed contractors.

According to GovTribe data, Booz Allen has won $345 million in contract obligations at DHA over the last three years. Deloitte has $264 million over the same period, and Accenture is listed with $66 million in obligations.

Accenture, Booz Allen and Deloitte did not respond to requests for comments.

Another $1.4 billion cut was an Air Force contract held by Accenture to resell enterprise cloud IT services.

This contract may be the Air Force Cloud One task order that Accenture won in September. It had a $1.6 billion ceiling over five years and was described as cloud reselling contract across multiple cloud services.

When Accenture officially announced the win in Octoer, the company said it was a managed services contract with features such as real-time cost transparency and multi-cloud billing. According to Deltek data, only $48 million in work has been obligated through the contract.

Other cancellations announced this week include $500 million in business process consulting work at the Navy’s administrative offices of the bureau of medicine.

Also being cut is a DARPA IT helpdesk contract that duplicates services that DISA could provide.

DOD did not identify the contractors involved at DARPA and the Navy.

While the contracts are being terminated, the work will shift to DOD personnel, Hegseth said.

DOD is also pausing $500 million in grants with Northwestern and Cornell universities, which is on top of $70 million grants that the department froze at Columbia, Penn, Brown, and Princeton universities.

“As if any of these institutions need more government money at all,” Hegseth said.

To date, the DOGE has found $6 billion in contract cuts at DOD, including this latest batch, in the first six weeks that it has been combing through the department’s spending, according to Hegseth.

The memo also says that DOGE and DOD will work together over the next 30 days to prepare a plan to in-source IT consulting and management services to the department's civilian workforce. The plan will include how to negotiate better pricing on software and cloud services. ""So the DOD pays no more for IT services than any other enterprise in America,"" according to the memo.

Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth directed officials to make the cuts in a Thursday memorandum. Additionally, he instructed the Pentagon’s chief information officer to prepare a new plan for lowering technology spending.

In a video, Hegseth said the canceled deals include a $1.8 billion batch of consulting agreements awarded by the Defense Health Agency. The DHA is tasked with supporting the internal healthcare services of the U.S. military’s six branches. The agency employs about 130,000 military and civilian personnel.

The scrapped contracts were awarded to multiple consultancies including Booz Allen Hamilton Holding Corp., Accenture Inc. and Deloitte LLP. The trio are among the world’s largest professional services companies.

Booz Allen is a technology consultancy that generates 98% of its nearly $11 billion in annual revenue from the public sector. Accenture and Deloitte, meanwhile, mainly work with private companies. However, they too have significant public sector businesses: Deloitte’s government and public services practice alone generates $5.5 billion in annual revenue.

Another major item on the list of deals canceled by Hegseth is a $500 million Navy contract for business process consulting. Business practice consultants help organizations streamline the internal workflows through which they perform tasks such as processing documents. According to Hegseth, those services were provided to administrative offices at the Bureau of Medicine, the Navy’s internal healthcare system.

Another item on the list was a $1.4 billion cloud services contract with a software reseller. Additionally, the Defense Department is scrapping a $500 million program through which the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency procures information technology help desk services. Hegseth said those services are “completely duplicative” because technical support is also provided by the Defense Information Systems Agency.

The memorandum in which Hegseth called for the contracts to be scrapped also directs the Defense Department’s CIO to find a way of further cutting IT costs. Officials will have to draft a plan for doing so within 30 days. The Department of Government Efficiency, or DOGE, will be involved in the effort.

According to the memorandum, the cost-cutting initiative will place an emphasis on scrapping unneeded software licenses. Additionally, officials must develop a plan for lowering the price of the licenses and cloud services that the Pentagon chooses to retain. A third goal of the efficiency push will be to “in-source IT consulting and management services to our civilian workforce.”

The Pentagon’s civilian workforce is also a focus of Hegseth’s restructuring push. On Monday, the Defense Department issued guidance calling for non-essential civilian positions to be “reclassified, outsourced, or removed.” Officials were given until today to submit proposals for how to carry out the initiative.",https://d15shllkswkct0.cloudfront.net/wp-content/blogs.dir/1/files/2025/04/54340614909_2962db574d_k.jpg,N,0.0,2025-04-11 16:56:28.555392

MILLINGTON, Tenn. – Petty Officer 3rd Class Damelah Fluker, a native of Chicago, Illinois, was meritoriously advanced in rank while serving aboard U.S. Navy Medicine Readiness and Training Command (USNMRTC) Guantanamo Bay at U.S. Naval Hospital Guantanamo Bay, Cuba.

Fluker, a 2023 graduate of Hillcrest High School, was selected for the Meritorious Advancement Program (MAP) and received her petty officer third class rank pins during a ceremony on March 28 at U.S. Naval Hospital Guantanamo Bay.

The Meritorious Advancement Program (MAP) is a system within the military that allows exceptional service members to be promoted ahead of the usual timeline, based on their outstanding performance and contributions.

“Receiving the honor of being selected for the Meritorious Advancement Program as a logistics specialist in a hospital predominantly staffed by hospital corpsmen holds great significance to me,” said Fluker. “It demonstrates that my efforts have not gone unnoticed. I believe it’s essential for sailors to feel valued and recognized for their contributions, even during times when it might seem otherwise.”

Fluker joined the Navy two years ago. Today, Fluker serves as a logistics specialist.

USNMRTC Guantanamo Bay focuses on three critical mission priorities: warfighter readiness, medical force generation and supporting the delivery of high-quality health care at U.S. Naval Hospital Guantanamo Bay.

U.S. Naval Hospital Guantanamo Bay provides health care to the U.S. Naval Station Guantanamo Bay community, which consists of approximately 4,500 military members, federal employees, U.S. and foreign national contractors and their families. The hospital also operates the only overseas military home health care facility providing care to elderly special category residents who sought asylum on the installation during the Cuban Revolution.

The U.S. Navy is celebrating its 250th birthday this year.

According to Navy officials, “America is a maritime nation and for 250 years, America’s Warfighting Navy has sailed the globe in defense of freedom.”

As Fluker and other sailors continue to train and perform missions, they take pride in serving their country in the U.S. Navy.",https://d1ldvf68ux039x.cloudfront.net/thumbs/photos/2504/8968542/1000w_q95.jpg,N,0.0,2025-04-11 15:56:25.857873

I live in the West region for Tricare, and I have the TYA select plan. I've been with Tricare since I was 13, when my sponsor (my grandpa) adopted me. I've never had issues with them when they were operating under Health Net Federal Services. Well, since the transfer to TriWest Health Care Alliance at the beginning of the year, I've had nothing but problems.

While my medical claims are being processed and paid in a timely manner, my mental health claims aren't. I have mental health visits dating back to December 12th that aren't in the HNFS and TriWest systems at all (at least not from what I can see on the secure portals). My providers say that the claims have gone through, but it's been months and they still say ""pending insurance"". None have been denied as far as I'm aware. I'm worried that my claims legitimately aren't going through to Tricare even though my provider verified my insurance and that I'll start getting bills soon. Has this been happening to anyone else in the West region? Is there anything I can do or should I just have my providers deal with this? They are both in the Tricare system as being licensed providers.

I do have OHI, which I reported a few weeks ago. But it's my state's Medicaid program so Tricare would be my primary payer still. I've had both insurances since I was a minor with no issue.

The one thing I'm doing to try to help the situation is writing a letter to the TriWest claims office explaining my predicament and providing them with an itemized bill for each visit that isn't showing up in the secure portal system. I should hopefully have that sent out by next week. I've also sent a secure message to HNFS through their portal, but I'm having issues signing onto the platform now so I can't tell if they responded or not. I'm really at a loss as to what to do. I'll obviously have my providers resubmit the claims if they come back denied or unprocessed, but I want to make sure it doesn't get to that point ya know?

Any report of TRICARE up and running smoothly in 2025?

Does the new TRICARE contract include penalties for not running smoothly on Jan 1st?

Do they all get paid the same whether customers are happy or not?

The TRICARE reputation is one of several areas that have declined for the US Armed Forces going back to the 1980s.

The 1980s was a decade that featured no recruiting crisis. The all volunteer military was working well, but the catastrophic military failure of 911 and decades of expensive/undeclared/unwon wars since then set things up for cutting back on the traditional benefits people thought they were earning when they reenlisted to go to far away places and maybe never come back again.

Back in 2014

American Legion:

“American Legion fights TRICARE increases Commander says troops, military retirees and their families should not be targeted in new efforts to cut federal costs. The leader of The American Legion says he strongly opposes White House pressures to raise the cost of TRICARE coverage for some military retirees. TRICARE is the Department of Defense’s health-care insurance program for uniformed servicemembers, military retirees and their family members.”

“As Military.com writer Richard Sisk reports, the White House, as part of 2014 defense budget discussions, is urging the Pentagon to slow the growth of TRICARE costs by phasing in an increase in the TRICARE Prime plan’s current enrollment fee for working age retirees as well as raising co-pays for military retirees under the age of 65.”

Local Tricare offices to see shift in services rendered

The Daily News

THOMAS BRENNAN Daily News Staff Jan 14, 2014

“Walk-in services at Camp Lejeune’s Tricare office soon will be a thing of the past.”

“Administrative tasks such as in and out-processing and changing primary care providers, all things that can be done on the Tricare website, will no longer be available as in-person services aboard local bases as of April 1, according to Pentagon officials. Beneficiaries will also be required to process their billing related questions online rather than in person. According to Tricare, this switch will allow them to save more than $250 million over the next five years.”

2025

Today, TRICARE has a reputation for broken web sites, tortuous internet protocols and long phone wait times at understaffed call centers.

Thousands of American families have now had a loved one who did one or more tours in Iraq or Afghanistan.

Will they support new enlistments?

It’s time for a reckoning at Defense Health Agency over Tricare

Story by Kristi Cabiao – Air Force Times

April 10, 2025

“On Jan. 1, Tricare – the essential health care benefit serving millions of service members, retirees and their families – entered a new cycle of contracts for managing the military’s health care system. This transition, intended to improve efficiency and service, has instead exposed Tricare to systemic failure, mismanagement and what increasingly appears to be gross negligence.”

“Since the launch, families across the country have experienced a catastrophic disruption in care. Enrollment errors have left beneficiaries uninsured. Surgical procedures have been canceled when hospitals couldn’t verify prior authorization. Chronically ill patients have struggled to find providers to maintain life-sustaining treatment. For many military children with disabilities, years of hard-fought progress are at risk of being erased because therapy appointments were abruptly stopped.”

“The source of these failures lies not only with the regional contractors – Humana Military (East) and TriWest Healthcare Alliance (West) – but with the Defense Health Agency (DHA), which bears full responsibility for contract oversight and system accountability.”

“It is clear DHA either ignored the lessons of the past or failed to learn from them. In 2019, the Government Accountability Office (GAO) warned that the previous Tricare transition in 2017 was marred by weaknesses in transition guidance and oversight. GAO’s recommendations were either poorly implemented or ignored – and now military families are paying the price.”

Welcome Home Troops

In a recent survey conducted by Mission Alpha Advocacy, families report spending hours on hold with Tricare contractors – only to be disconnected or told to “call back later.”

“And what has been lost in the chaos is trust. Trust between families and their health care system. Trust between providers and the military medical infrastructure they have long supported. And perhaps most critically, trust between the force and the leaders responsible for ensuring military readiness.”

“Resilience – the ability of military families to withstand constant relocations, deployments and separation – relies on predictable support systems. When families move to a new duty station and discover their Tricare benefits are inaccessible, resilience becomes even more difficult.”

“And retention? It evaporates when military families feel neglected. No incentive pay or patriotic appeal can convince a family to stay if the health care system that serves them is broken beyond repair.”

What became of enlisted leaders?

Not here to say that military benefits are inadequate. Just stick with whatever was offered when people signed up to stay on for multiple tours in Iraq and Afghanistan and we’re good.

If you did your homework back in May of 2024, you remember:

“We are committed to keeping all of our military families informed about your health plan, your choices, and ensuring a seamless transition to new contractors,” said Lt. Gen. Telita Crosland, director of the DHA.

Q&A: What To Know as New TRICARE Contracts Begin in 2025

By TRICARE Communications

Original deadline:

The Defense Health Agency (DHA) and the two regional contractors in the East Region and West Region are currently transitioning to these new contracts to ensure health care delivery is ready for all beneficiaries on Jan. 1, 2025.

“…new contracts will improve health care delivery, quality, and access for beneficiaries living in the United States.”

It would be good to hear from the Senior Enlisted Advisor to the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff on this.

Elected officials:

Stop kissing veteran ass on Armistice Day and every other chance you get. Stop with the “Thanks for your service” nonsense.

People volunteered to go to far away places and maybe never come back again.

Go to work to smooth out the process they face when they need to call and manage whatever benefits they earned.

Older veterans have influence with kids, grandkids and younger members of the community. Do right by them if you ever hope to dig out of your US Armed Forces recruiting crisis.

Zynex’s Disappointing Fourth Quarter Results

ZYXI share price depression stems from its disastrous 4Q 2024 earnings release. The Englewood, Colorado-based firm reported fourth-quarter 2024 revenue of $46.0 million, a roughly 2% year-over-year decline, falling short of Wall Street's expectations. The company also swung to a net loss of $0.02 per share, a stark contrast to the $0.04 net income per share reported in the same period last year.

The disappointing results reportedly prompted RBC Capital Markets to downgrade Zynex to Sector Perform from Outperform. According to news outlets, in a report to its clients, RBC analyst Shagun Singh cited a ""lack of visibility"" into the company's operations and commercial outlook, particularly concerning its relationship with Tricare, the military health program that represents a significant portion of Zynex's revenue.

Singh reportedly noted that Tricare, Zynex's largest customer, has temporarily suspended payments amid an ongoing review of prior claims. Singh added that the company's decision to withhold 2025 guidance and implement a 15% workforce reduction further compounded investor concerns. Singh revised RBC’s price target for Zynex shares to $5.50, down from $11.00, warning of a potential ""domino effect"" stemming from Tricare's payment suspension.

Zynex Securities Class Action

Adding to Zynex’s woes, a securities class action lawsuit has been filed in the District Court of Colorado, alleging that the company made false and misleading statements regarding its revenue recognition practices and its relationship with Tricare. The suit, captioned Tuncel v. Zynex, Inc., et al., seeks to represent investors who purchased Zynex securities between March 13, 2023, and March 11, 2025.

The complaint alleges that Zynex engaged in “oversupplying” customers with products, including electrodes, leading to inflated revenue figures. It further claims that this practice drew scrutiny from insurers, including Tricare, and that Zynex failed to disclose the potential for adverse consequences, such as removal from insurer networks and government penalties.

According to the complaint, revelations of Zynex's alleged practices surfaced with a June 4, 2024 report by medical journal STAAT detailing an ""oversupplying scheme"" involving excessive shipments of supplies and subsequent inflated billing. The report also indicated that insurers were ""kicking the company out of network.""

The truth allegedly emerged on March 11, 2025, when Zynex reported its dismal Q4 and FY 2024 financial results. The complaint highlights Zynex CEO Thomas Sandgaard’s attributing the fourth-quarter revenue shortfall to ""slower than normal payments from certain payers"" and the Tricare payment suspension.

Hagens Berman’s Investigation

Hagens Berman is investigating the alleged claims. “We are examining Zynex's financial reporting and business practices. We believe investors deserve a complete and transparent understanding of these events,” said Reed Kathrein, the Hagens Berman Partner leading the firm's probe.

I had a mess trying to get Humira because my doctor filled it out completely wrong. I had to get their MA to fix it and submit it myself and it was approved right away.

Approval through Tricare was very easy and quick. I was on compound Tirzepatide from Sept to Dec 2024 and in January I was approved for name brand Zepbound. Just make sure you and your provider will out the PA correctly. Don’t go straight down the list of questions.

For example, question 2 ask your age and if you are over 18 then you proceed to question 6 and skip questions 3,4, and 5. Answer question 6 and go to question 7 then answer it and it may have you go to question 8 or 9 depending on my on the answer.

Just pay close attention to the questions about having tried a certain medication and any adverse or contraindications. Depending how the provider answer it then you’ll either proceed to another question or be told on the PA form coverage not approved. Tricare only makes you try 1 medication instead of 3 or 4 like in previous years.

Since you are already on Zepbound, your provider may say that you have already tried other medications in the past or they may not.

Once the PA is signed by the provider and sent up, normally takes about a few hours to 1 day to approve depending on how back logged express scripts is.

“We’re excited to make these cuts on behalf of you, the taxpayer, and the warfighters here at the department,” Hegseth said.
But critics believe that the cuts mainly hurt important services and the people who need help the most.","U.S. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth has announced the cancellation of IT service contracts totalling $5.1 billion. This decision impacts major companies like Accenture and Deloitte. According to the U.S. Department of Defense, the move is part of a larger effort to cut down on what the Pentagon considers ‘wasteful spending’.

Citing a few examples, Hegseth said, “... for consulting services from Accenture, Deloitte, Booz Allen, and other firms. They're going to save the department $1.8 billion.” In a memo signed on April 10, Hegseth referred to the cancelled contracts as ""non-essential spending on third-party consultants"" for work that Pentagon staff could handle themselves. He highlighted that ending these contracts would save an estimated $4 billion.

The Pentagon is cancelling several major contracts, including a $1.8 billion consulting deal managed by the Defense Health Agency, a $1.4 billion enterprise cloud IT services contract awarded to a software reseller, and a $500 million Navy contract for business process consulting. It’s also ending a $500 million IT help desk services contract under the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA), as these services are already being provided by the Defense Information Systems Agency (DISA). The Pentagon will stop more than $500 million in funding to two universities that have been accused of allowing antisemitism and backing diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) programs. This comes on top of the $70 million already taken back from three other universities in recent weeks.

Hegseth explained that the budget cuts are meant to shift money towards better healthcare services for military members and their families, instead of spending “$500 an hour” on business consultants. He also repeated the Trump administration’s promise to cut unnecessary spending, especially on contracts related to DEI programs, climate change efforts and pandemic response work. This announcement comes after Hegseth’s statement on March 20, where he shared plans to cut $580 million from various programs, contracts, and grants. Altogether, the total cuts now add up to nearly $6 billion. These changes are part of the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) initiative, which is focused on reducing Pentagon expenses and putting more resources into strengthening military capabilities. “We’re excited to make these cuts on behalf of you, the taxpayer, and the warfighters here at the department,” Hegseth said.

Since President Donald Trump took office, the US government has started making big budget cuts in all areas. These cuts are mainly being carried out by the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), which is led by Elon Musk. His goal is to reduce government spending by $2 trillion. As a result, around 60,000 federal workers have either lost their jobs or been put on leave. Some federal agencies, like the United States Agency for International Development (USAID) and the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, have been shut down. In addition, funding has been reduced for many areas, including USAID and education.

The government says these steps will help save a lot of money and make things work more efficiently. But critics believe that the cuts mainly hurt important services and the people who need help the most. This has caused large protests across the US, and some people have even taken legal action to stop certain parts of the policy.",https://myind.net/sites/default/files/field/image/46b3b567_wasteful.jpg,N,0.0,2025-04-11 15:56:33.917075

That’s with a B, $5.1 billion in DoD contracts for ancillary things like consulting and other non-essential services,” Hegseth said in a video statement posted to social media platform X, Thursday evening.
Hegseth said he plans to cut four IT-related contracts, all which he said could be “more efficiently performed by the highly skilled members of our DoD workforce using existing resources,” per the memo.
Also within 30 days, the CIO must prepare a plan to “negotiate most favorable rates” on cloud services and software so the Pentagon “pays no more for IT services than any other enterprise in America.” Further, the CIO must create an audit of DoD software licensing by April 18 to ensure the department is only paying for what it “actually” uses and needs “at the most favorable rates.”","WASHINGTON — Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth released a memo late Thursday night directing the termination of a slew of Defense consulting contracts related to information technology and other “non-essential activities.”

Hegseth said he plans to cut four IT-related contracts, all which he said could be “more efficiently performed by the highly skilled members of our DoD workforce using existing resources,” per the memo.

The cancelled IT contracts are as follows:

A Defense Health Agency contract for consulting services from Accenture, Deloitte, Booz Allen, and other firms, which the Defense Secretary said will save the Pentagon $1.8 billion

An Air Force contract with Accenture to re-sell third party Enterprise Cloud IT Services, saving the department $1.4 billion Hegseth said

A Navy contract for business process consulting services for administrative offices worth $500 million

A DARPA contract for IT Helpdesk Services, worth another $500 million, according to Hegseth

At the end of the memo, Hegseth calls for the termination of 11 additional contracts across the Pentagon related to consulting services that “support Diversity, Equity and Inclusion (DEI), Climate, Covid-19 response, and non-essential activities.”

Taken together, the memo states that the cancellation of these contracts represent over $5 billion in “wasteful spending” across the department and this move will save nearly $4 million which the department can “re-allocate to our mission critical priorities to Revive the Warrior Ethos, Rebuild the Military, and Reestablish Deterrence.”

Elsewhere the memo orders the Pentagon’s Chief Information Officer, in “coordination” with Elon Musk’s Department of Government Efficiency, to prepare a plan within 30 days to “in-source” IT consulting and management services to the department’s civilian workforce.

Also within 30 days, the CIO must prepare a plan to “negotiate most favorable rates” on cloud services and software so the Pentagon “pays no more for IT services than any other enterprise in America.” Further, the CIO must create an audit of DoD software licensing by April 18 to ensure the department is only paying for what it “actually” uses and needs “at the most favorable rates.”",https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2025/04/8861293-scaled-e1744387242690-1024x577.jpg,N,0.0,2025-04-11 13:56:34.532707

“That’s a lot of consulting.” Deloitte and Accenture did not respond to a request for comment by publication time.
Hegseth also ordered the termination of 11 other contracts for consulting services related to diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI); climate policies, COVID-19 response, and nonessential activities across the department.

In the memo, Hegseth ordered the DOD to cancel a Defense Health Agency contract with Accenture, Deloitte, and other companies for services that he said “can be performed by our civilian workforce.”

Other contracts to be terminated include an Air Force contract with Accenture to resell third-party Enterprise Cloud IT Services, a Navy contract for business process consulting services, and the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency’s contract for IT help desk services.

Those contracts, Hegseth said, represent “non-essential spending on third party consultants” for services that highly skilled DOD employees could perform using existing resources.

“By the way, we need this money to spend on better health care for our warfighters and their families, instead of $500 an hour business process consultant,” he said in a social media video. “That’s a lot of consulting.”

Deloitte and Accenture did not respond to a request for comment by publication time.

Hegseth also ordered the termination of 11 other contracts for consulting services related to diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI); climate policies, COVID-19 response, and nonessential activities across the department.

“We are committed to rooting out DEI—root and branch—throughout this department, and we found 11 more contracts. We’re going to keep looking,” the Pentagon chief said.

Last month, Hegseth issued another memo directing the termination of more than $580 million in “wasteful spending,” which included a software development program for the Defense Civilian Human Resources Management System and grants related to DEI and climate policies.

He also ordered the cancellation of a $9 million university grant for developing “equitable AI and machine learning models,” saying that the DOD needs lethal machine learning models instead.

According to Hegseth, the DOD has halted more than $500 million in funding to Northwestern University and Cornell University this week, on top of the $70 million already paused at four other academic institutions that he deemed “tolerate anti-Semitism and support divisive DEI programs.”

The latest round of contract terminations will bring the DOD’s total spending cut to nearly $6 billion over the first six weeks of the Department of Government Efficiency’s (DOGE’s) efforts to eliminate wasteful spending within the department, Hegseth said.

“[DOGE’s] job is to go out and find the stuff that we can get rid of, and then flow back into, drive back into war-fighting capabilities here at the Defense Department,” he said in the April 10 video.

President Donald Trump signed an executive order on Jan. 20 renaming the existing U.S. Digital Service as DOGE and tasked it with reviewing federal agencies for potential downsizing and cost reductions. The order states that DOGE’s work is expected to be completed by July 4, 2026.

To conduct audits, DOGE has been granted access to federal systems, sparking legal challenges from some Democratic lawmakers and labor unions who argued the access is unconstitutional.

To support the Trump administration’s efforts to reduce government spending, the DOD has discontinued 91 studies ranging from looking at climate-related issues and global migration patterns to social trends. The DOD said discontinuing them would save the government more than $30 million in the first year.

The DOD said it will instead redirect resources toward “technologies essential for maintaining a strong national defense” and fund research focused on developing and fielding advanced military capabilities.

It aims to invest in key areas such as “hypersonic weapons development, AI-powered systems for enhanced battlefield awareness, and strengthening the domestic military industrial base.”

Hegseth has also directed military officials to identify $50 billion in potential cuts from the former Biden administration’s fiscal year 2026 budget “that could be realigned from low-impact and low-priority Biden-legacy programs” and redirect them toward Trump’s defense priorities.",https://i.ntd.com/assets/uploads/2025/04/id1060013-04022025-DSC08126-Pentagon.jpg-1200x630.webp,N,0.0,2025-04-11 14:56:29.956238

The Trump administration has been on a drive to eliminate waste and inefficiency, and had already told the top ten consulting firms, and top five software suppliers, that they were in its cross hairs.

Yesterday, Hegseth terminated “A Defense Health Agency contract for consulting services from Accenture, Deloitte, Booz Allen, and other firms that can be performed by our civilian workforce”.

He also axed an air force contract with Accenture “to re-sell third party Enterprise Cloud IT Services which we can already fulfill directly with existing procurement resources”

Alongside them on the chopping block were a Navy contract for business process consulting, and a DARPA contract for IT Helpdesk Services.

Hegseth, in a DoD video highlighting the cuts, said the DHA contract was worth $1.8bn, while the enterprise cloud contract was worth $1.4bn. The Navy and DARPA contracts each had a $500m price tag.

""We need this money to spend on better health care for our warfighters and their families, instead of $500 an hour business process consultant,"" Hegseth said. ""That's a lot of consulting.""

Hegseth didn’t stop there, with cut to “11 contracts related to diversity, equity and inclusion, climate change, the department's response to the COVID-19 pandemic and related nonessential activities”. And he hit pause on $500m of funding for two universities accused of tolerating “antisemitism and support divisive DEI programs.""

The Elon Musk piloted DOGE appears to have been the prime mover behind the cuts, and Hegseth said, “Today's cuts bring our running total to nearly $6 billion in wasteful spending over the first six weeks of the Department of Government Efficiency effort here at the Defense Department.”

That $6 billion represents just under half a percent of the DoD’s $1.39 trillion budget. Which might not sound a lot in percentage terms. But for slim margin business, such as supermarkets and other retailers, it could be the different between profit and loss.

Consultancy firms tend not to be low margin, but the contract losses are still likely to be meaningful for the consultants involved.

Last April 3, this well-known Hollywood actor celebrated the premiere of his Broadway play, Good Night, and Good Luck, at the Winter Garden Theatre in New York. An event marked by the absence of his wife, Amal.

As expected, this detail once again brought to the table the rumors about their supposed marital crisis. That's why George Clooney had no qualms about clarifying this misunderstanding to the media and assured that his wife had to stay home with their children.

Now, after the commotion that was caused, Julia Roberts has stepped forward to talk about the bond that exists between her and the actor. A confession she revealed on the show hosted by Jimmy Kimmel.

As we all know, these two great figures of American cinema met during the filming of the movie Ocean’s Eleven, and the connection between them was practically instantaneous. ""From there, we became friends instantly,"" the actress assured during her latest television interview.

Earlier this week at the Sea-Air-Space conference, Navy Chief Information Officer Jane Rathbun said DOGE and the DOD CIO were reviewing the service’s software enterprise.","Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth signed a memo Thursday ordering the termination of several IT services contracts and directing the Pentagon’s chief information officer to draw up plans for in-sourcing, among other measures.

The aim is to “cut wasteful spending” and “support the continued rationalization” of the Defense Department’s IT enterprise, Hegseth wrote.

The move comes amid a broader push by the Trump administration to implement Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) initiatives across federal agencies.

Hegseth’s new memo to senior Pentagon leadership ordered the termination of contracts affecting a variety of DOD components, including a Defense Health Agency contract for consulting services; an Air Force contract to re-sell third party enterprise cloud IT services; a Navy contract for business process consulting services; and a Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) contract for IT helpdesk services.

In a video released on social media touting these DOGE-related efforts, Hegseth estimated that those contract terminations would save the Pentagon approximately $1.8 billion, $1.4 billion, $500 million and $500 million, respectively.

“These contracts represent non-essential spending on third party consultants to perform services more efficiently performed by the highly skilled members of our DoD workforce using existing resources,” he wrote in the memo.

Hegseth also tasked the Pentagon CIO to work with the DOGE team to produce a plan within 30 days for how DOD will in-source IT consulting and management services to the department’s civilian workforce.

The new call for in-sourcing comes as Pentagon leaders are advancing efforts to make major cuts to the civilian workforce. Hegseth has said he wants to reinvest savings from employee reductions into higher-priority warfighting capabilities.

The plan from the CIO that Hegseth ordered in Thursday’s memo must also address how the Defense Department will negotiate “most favorable rates on software and cloud services, so the DoD pays no more for IT services than any other enterprise in America,” the SecDef wrote.

The memo also tasks the chief information officer to complete an audit of Pentagon software licensing by April 18. The purpose of the audit is “to ensure we are only paying for the licenses we actually use, the features we actually need, at the most favorable rates,” according to Hegseth.

Katie Arrington is currently performing the duties of DOD CIO.

Earlier this week at the Sea-Air-Space conference, Navy Chief Information Officer Jane Rathbun said DOGE and the DOD CIO were reviewing the service’s software enterprise.

“It’s all about making the right investments in modernizing, but modernizing with an eye towards effectiveness and efficiency. We’ve got this new administration. We’ve got the DOGE in working with us, and they’re focused on effective consumption of commercial software. Are we doing the best job we can deliver in buying and utilizing the software that we have?” she said.

The Navy is a huge purchaser of software licenses, Rathbun noted.

“It’s a big number. And so are we buying effectively? Are we utilizing the things that we’re buying effectively? There’s always opportunity for improvement. And I would say that’s an area in my portfolio that I want to focus on but have not a lot of people to do that, which is something that has always bothered me and I want to be doing better at is really this optimization concept. I’ve got to continuously modernize but I have to do it in an optimal way,” she said.",https://defensescoop.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/8/2025/04/Hegseth.jpg,N,0.0,2025-04-11 05:56:32.601573

Some of the biggest adjustments Soldiers face as they retire are related to health insurance and medical care, but brushing up on your health care knowledge pre-transition can help smooth the way.

Until now, you’ve received most or all of your care at military treatment facilities. You likely pay little or no out-of-pocket expenses for prescriptions, co-pays, and deductibles. At the same time, you probably don’t have many choices when it comes to selecting your providers.

Things will be a little different as a civilian, as this Soldier for Life Podcast explains.

TRICARE and Retirement

If you’re retiring, you will remain eligible for space available care at military clinics, hospitals and pharmacies. TRICARE has several plans, depending on your age and

location, including:

TRICARE Prime, the plan you’re probably most familiar with.

TRICARE Select, a fee-for-service plan that will give you more provider choices.

TRICARE Prime Option — US Family Health Plan, a community-based option available at six regional, nonprofit health care systems.

TRICARE For Life, a default plan that provides wraparound coverage if you have both Medicare Part A and Part B.

In addition, TRICARE has Retired Reserve, overseas, and young adult options. You may also be able to obtain dental and vision benefits via the Federal Employees Dental and Vision Insurance Program.

However, coverage doesn’t automatically continue after retirement. To avoid a break in coverage, you must reenroll within 90 days of retirement, although you may request retroactive enrollment for up to 12 months. Otherwise, you can enroll during a TRICARE Open Season or after a qualifying life event (QLE), such as marriage, divorce, birth or adoption of a child or loss of other health benefits.

To see if something is covered or not covered, you can visit TRICARE’s Covered Services page. Keep in mind that you may have to pay annual enrollment fees, and your out-of-pocket costs — premiums, office co-pays, deductibles, etc. — will be higher than your active-duty Army medical expenses.

TRICARE and Separation

Some Soldiers who separate from the Army before becoming eligible for retirement may still qualify for short-term health insurance from TRICARE:

The Transitional Assistance Management Program provides 180 days of premium free health care benefits for eligible new veterans.

The Continued Health Care Benefit Program provides premium based coverage equivalent to TRICARE Select for eligible new veterans for up to 36 months.

Civilian Insurance

Compared to many civilian insurance programs, TRICARE offers excellent coverage at reasonable rates. However, you could be eligible for competitive health, dental, and vision benefits from your new employer or from a spouse’s employer. Consider comparing plans to determine which coverage best meets your family’s needs. Make sure to look up your preferred providers in each plan directory to see if they’re in network.

Common civilian medical plans include:

Exclusive Provider Organizations: Nonemergency services are only covered if you use doctors and hospitals in the plan’s network.

Health Maintenance Organizations: HMOs often provide integrated care that focuses on wellness and prevention, but limit nonemergency coverage to doctors who work for them.

Points of Service: You pay less if you use hospitals and providers in the plan’s network. You must obtain a referral from your primary care doctor to see a specialist.

Preferred Provider Organizations: Providers in the plan's network cost less, but you can still use out-of-network doctors, hospitals, and providers for an additional cost.

High-Deductible Health Plans: High-deductible plans have higher deductibles than traditional insurance plans, but lower monthly premiums. You pay more before insurance kicks in.

If you have a family member with a chronic or severe illness that requires many out-of-pocket expenses, depending on cost, it may make sense to enroll in two plans. Your civilian insurance would serve as your primary coverage, and TRICARE would become secondary. While you would spend more on monthly premiums, it could eliminate some or all of your co-pays.

On the other hand, some civilian companies will pay you a stipend if you decline their health benefits.

You could use this to cover a portion of your TRICARE enrollment fees. If you need help deciding what health coverage makes the most sense financially, check with a trusted personal financial manager or counselor.

In a Department of Defense memo, Hegseth said he would cut a Defense Health Agency contract ""for consulting services from Accenture, Deloitte, Booz Allen, and other firms that can be performed by our civilian workforce.""
Hegseth said the terminations ""represent $5.1 billion in wasteful spending"" at the DOD and would result in nearly $4 billion in savings.
That's a lot of consulting,"" Hegseth said in the video.
Last month, Hegseth announced that the Defense Department was terminating over $580 million in programs, contracts, and grants that DOGE had identified as wasteful spending.","The US's defense secretary, Pete Hegseth, just ordered the termination of IT and consulting contracts with companies like Accenture and Deloitte, calling it ""wasteful spending.""

In a Department of Defense memo, Hegseth said he would cut a Defense Health Agency contract ""for consulting services from Accenture, Deloitte, Booz Allen, and other firms that can be performed by our civilian workforce.""

Also on the chopping block is the Air Force's contract with Accenture to ""re-sell third-party Enterprise Cloud IT Services,"" which Hegseth says the government can ""already fulfill directly with existing procurement resources.""

In the memo, Hegseth also said he was terminating 11 other contracts for ""consulting services"" that support ""non-essential"" activities, like Diversity, Equity and Inclusion (DEI), climate matters, and the Pentagon's COVID-19 response.

Hegseth said the terminations ""represent $5.1 billion in wasteful spending"" at the DOD and would result in nearly $4 billion in savings.

The savings would be reallocated, Hegseth said, to serve ""critical priorities to Revive the Warrior Ethos, Rebuild the Military, and Reestablish Deterrence.""

He did not specify in his memo which Pentagon projects this money would go to.

In response to a request for comment, the DOD directed Business Insider to an X video of Hegseth talking about the terminations.

""By the way, we need this money to spend on better healthcare for our warfighters and their families, instead of $500 an hour business process consultant. That's a lot of consulting,"" Hegseth said in the video.

Hegseth also expressed his gratitude to Elon Musk's cost-cutting outfit, the Department of Government of Efficiency. DOGE has been slashing federal spending across various agencies, whether it be by laying off thousands of federal workers or shuttering foreign aid programs.

""So we want to thank our friends at DOGE. We want to thank all the folks here that have helped us unpack this, reveal it, and we're excited to make these cuts on behalf of you, the taxpayer and the warfighters at the Department,"" Hegseth said in his X video.

""We are committed to rooting out DEI — root and branch — throughout this department … [And] I'm going to keep looking,"" Hegseth said.

He also announced cuts on the academic front, saying that DOD would be pausing over $500 million in funding to a pair of universities that ""tolerate antisemitism and support divisive DEI programs."" This is in addition to the $70 million already cut in funding at three other colleges in the past weeks.

Today's announcement follows Hegseth's initial March 20, 2025, announcement that the department would be cutting $580 million in programs, contracts and grants.

""If you're keeping score at home, today's cuts bring our running total to nearly $6 billion in wasteful spending over the first six weeks of the Department of Government Efficiency effort here at the Defense Department,"" Hegseth said, adding that DOGE's job is to find wasteful spending at DOD so that the funds can be driven back into the department's warfighting capabilities.

Hegseth first announced that DOGE would be working within DOD during a recorded, on-camera address he made Feb. 20, 2025, regarding cutting excess and refocusing the department's budget.

The secretary wound down today's message by thanking DOGE and the people who unpacked and revealed the latest round of savings.

""We're excited to make these cuts on behalf of you, the taxpayer and the warfighters here at the department,"" he said.",https://media.defense.gov/2024/Feb/08/2003391289/1280/1280/0/210512-D-BM568-1296.JPG,N,0.0,2025-04-10 21:56:24.439428

The central check-in offers a new and convenient method for patients to begin their healthcare process at the clinic. This streamlined approach reduces wait times and improves overall efficiency during the patient’s visit. By centralizing check-in operations, the 55th MDG can better allocate staff resources, allowing medical professionals to focus on providing high-quality patient care throughout their time at the clinic.

Starting today, all patients will need to sign in at the central check-in desk located in the main pharmacy waiting area except for those being seen in the following clinics: dental, immunizations, lab, mental health (including Family Advocacy and True North), and women’s health.

Implementing the central check-in represents the 55th MDG's commitment to innovation and patient-centered care. This enhancement will improve and optimize clinic flow and standardize other administrative processes. “We are excited to offer this enhanced experience to our patients. The central check-in aligns us with healthcare industry standards and continues to show our commitment to being our patients’ facility of choice,” said Col. Tracy Bozung, commander of the 55th MDG.

“We are committed to rooting out the DEI root and branch throughout this department, and we have found 11 more contracts.

The specific cuts highlighted by the Secretary include:

$1.8 Billion: Saved by eliminating Defense Health Agency (DHA) consulting contracts with firms such as Accenture, Deloitte, and Booz Allen Hamilton.

$1.4 Billion: Saved from terminating a software reseller contract related to enterprise cloud IT services.

$500 Million: Cut from a Navy contract for business process consulting within administrative offices at the Bureau of Medicine. Hegseth commented, “We need this money to spend on Better Health Care for our Warfighters and their families, instead of 500 an hour business process consultant.”

$500 Million: Saved by cancelling a DARPA contract for IT help desk services described as “completely duplicative” with services already provided internally.

Hegseth also announced the termination of 11 additional contracts related to Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion (DEI), climate initiatives, and COVID-19 response activities across the department. “We are committed to rooting out the DEI root and branch throughout this department, and we have found 11 more contracts. We’re going to keep looking,” he affirmed.

In a related action aligned with stated presidential priorities, Hegseth noted the DOD is also pausing over $500 million in funding to Northwestern University and Cornell University this week due to concerns over DEI programs at those institutions.

This follows $70 million in funding pauses previously implemented for Columbia, Penn, Brown, and Princeton universities.

He credited the “DOD-DOGE” partnership for identifying these savings. The goal, he stated, is to redirect these funds “back into war fighting capabilities here at the defense department.”

“We’re excited to make these cuts on behalf of you, the taxpayer, and the warfighters here at the department,” Hegseth concluded.

Zynex's Disappointing Fourth Quarter Results

ZYXI share price depression stems from its disastrous 4Q 2024 earnings release. The Englewood, Colorado-based firm reported fourth-quarter 2024 revenue of $46.0 million, a roughly 2% year-over-year decline, falling short of Wall Street's expectations. The company also swung to a net loss of $0.02 per share, a stark contrast to the $0.04 net income per share reported in the same period last year.

The disappointing results reportedly prompted RBC Capital Markets to downgrade Zynex to Sector Perform from Outperform. According to news outlets, in a report to its clients, RBC analyst Shagun Singh cited a ""lack of visibility"" into the company's operations and commercial outlook, particularly concerning its relationship with Tricare, the military health program that represents a significant portion of Zynex's revenue.

Singh reportedly noted that Tricare, Zynex's largest customer, has temporarily suspended payments amid an ongoing review of prior claims. Singh added that the company's decision to withhold 2025 guidance and implement a 15% workforce reduction further compounded investor concerns. Singh revised RBC's price target for Zynex shares to $5.50, down from $11.00, warning of a potential ""domino effect"" stemming from Tricare's payment suspension.

Zynex Securities Class Action

Adding to Zynex's woes, a securities class action lawsuit has been filed in the District Court of Colorado, alleging that the company made false and misleading statements regarding its revenue recognition practices and its relationship with Tricare. The suit, captioned Tuncel v. Zynex, Inc., et al., seeks to represent investors who purchased Zynex securities between March 13, 2023, and March 11, 2025.

The complaint alleges that Zynex engaged in ""oversupplying"" customers with products, including electrodes, leading to inflated revenue figures. It further claims that this practice drew scrutiny from insurers, including Tricare, and that Zynex failed to disclose the potential for adverse consequences, such as removal from insurer networks and government penalties.

According to the complaint, revelations of Zynex's alleged practices surfaced with a June 4, 2024 report by medical journal STAAT detailing an ""oversupplying scheme"" involving excessive shipments of supplies and subsequent inflated billing. The report also indicated that insurers were ""kicking the company out of network.""

The truth allegedly emerged on March 11, 2025, when Zynex reported its dismal Q4 and FY 2024 financial results. The complaint highlights Zynex CEO Thomas Sandgaard's attributing the fourth-quarter revenue shortfall to ""slower than normal payments from certain payers"" and the Tricare payment suspension.

Hagens Berman's Investigation

Hagens Berman is investigating the alleged claims. ""We are examining Zynex's financial reporting and business practices. We believe investors deserve a complete and transparent understanding of these events,"" said Reed Kathrein, the Hagens Berman Partner leading the firm's probe.

“We are the only U.S. health care system that goes to war,” said Ferrara, who deployed four times when he served as an active duty U.S. Navy surgeon.
The chain he is referring to is the continued evolution and modernization of the health care system to improve access, quality, and safety.
He explains the MHS optimizes warfighter performance by sustaining readiness of the military force and those charged with their care and recovery.
“It starts with maintaining the ready medical force,” he explained.","For the Military Health System, readiness is a strategic imperative to ensure warfighter dominance, survivability, and resilience, said the acting Assistant Secretary of Defense for Health Affairs Dr. Stephen Ferrara.

“Readiness cannot be secondary. You cannot do readiness at the last minute. You cannot cram for readiness. When it comes to mission success, readiness is everything,” he said.

During his first two months on the job, Ferrara delivered that message at speaking engagements, visits to military hospitals and clinics, town hall forums, and interviews.

“We are the only U.S. health care system that goes to war,” said Ferrara, who deployed four times when he served as an active duty U.S. Navy surgeon.

“When America's sons and daughters go downrange and go into harm's way, we honor the pact we made with them and with their parents—that should they become ill or injured, they will receive prompt and effective medical attention anywhere in the world. That is the trust that we have. That's something that our adversaries don't always have, and it gives us an incredible strategic edge.”

His priorities for the Military Health System are to increase lethality of the warfighter, sustain the skills of the medical force, and ensure accessible, high-quality, and sustainable care.

“We have to support the warfighter, sustain our skills, and strengthen our chain,” he said. The chain he is referring to is the continued evolution and modernization of the health care system to improve access, quality, and safety.

“If we support, sustain, and strengthen, that is how we build a system that will fight and win, because fundamentally, this is what our job is: to fight and win,” he said.

“We do this by having a ready medical force, so we can provide strong battlefield care and keep guns in the fight,” he said. “We do this by maintaining the medically ready force—because readiness is a medical imperative like it is a moral imperative.”

Ferrara noted that part of his role is conveying to the Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth how the MHS is a tremendous force in his priority of force lethality. He explains the MHS optimizes warfighter performance by sustaining readiness of the military force and those charged with their care and recovery.

The Defense Health Program budget, which this year is approximately $61 billion, is about 7% of the Pentagon’s topline budget. “I show the Secretary how we take that topline budget, and how we use that to make the force more lethal, more fit to fight, and win,” he said.

“It starts with maintaining the ready medical force,” he explained. “We must ensure that every member of the team—from the surgeon who wields a scalpel, to the logistician who procured the scalpel, from the nurse who transfuses the blood, to the team who runs the blood bank—is at the top of their game. A team ready to go downrange to fight and win.”",https://d1ldvf68ux039x.cloudfront.net/thumbs/photos/2503/8923017/1000w_q95.jpg,N,1.0,2025-04-10 14:56:17.816588

The proposed reforms would reduce the volume of prior authorization requests, expedite approvals, extend authorization validity, and ensure that appeals are reviewed by qualified specialists.
This will help ensure that providers can discuss prior authorization denials with a professional peer who understands the recommended treatment and underlying condition.
“It’s vital that health care decisions must be made by professionals who understand the complexities of a patient’s condition,” said Assemblymember Addis.
“AB 512 is a crucial step toward improving patient access to timely care,” said Assemblymember Harabedian.","April 10, 2025

The president of California Medical Association (CMA), state legislators and dozens of physicians unveiled the Prioritizing Patients, Empowering Physicians bill package, a suite of legislation aimed at cutting red tape in the health care system and ensuring patients receive timely, medically necessary care.

“When people have health insurance, they expect to be able to get the health care they need when they need it,” said CMA President Shannon Udovic-Constant, M.D. “But too often, bureaucratic delays get in the way, forcing patients to wait for essential treatments while their physicians navigate unnecessary bureaucratic hurdles. This legislative package will put patients first, allowing doctors to focus on providing all our patients the best possible care.”

The package, which is sponsored by CMA and includes AB 510, AB 539, AB 512, and SB 306, addresses the burdensome prior authorization process that often delays patient care and, in some cases, leads to severe health consequences, including permanent bodily damage, hospitalizations, and even death. The proposed reforms would reduce the volume of prior authorization requests, expedite approvals, extend authorization validity, and ensure that appeals are reviewed by qualified specialists.

SB 306 by Senator Josh Becker (SD 13) requires health plans to remove the requirement for prior authorization from any service that they approve more than 90% of the time. This will reduce the overall volume of prior authorization requests and ensure that patients can receive the care they need with minimal delay and physicians can spend more time focusing on patient care.

“Doctors should be treating patients – not spending hours buried in paperwork that needlessly delays access to treatment. SB 306 cuts through the red tape to accelerate approval of services that are almost always approved anyway,” said Senator Becker. “It’s a simple, data-driven solution that will reduce delays in care, free up providers to do their jobs, and help patients get the timely treatment they need. This bill is about restoring common sense and compassion to our healthcare system.”

AB 510 by Assemblymember Dawn Addis (AD 30) requires that appeals of prior authorization denials be performed by a provider of the same or similar specialty. This will help ensure that providers can discuss prior authorization denials with a professional peer who understands the recommended treatment and underlying condition.

“It’s vital that health care decisions must be made by professionals who understand the complexities of a patient’s condition,” said Assemblymember Addis. “AB 510 is critical to protecting patient rights and ensuring access to a fair, transparent process that prioritizes health over profits.”

AB 539 by Assemblymember Pilar Schiavo (AD 40) extends the validity of an approved prior authorization to one year (current industry standard is 60 to 90 days). This will provide patients with a longer window of time to receive medically necessary care and avoid the cumbersome prior authorization review and appeal processes.

“People with often chronic health conditions should not have to argue with their insurance company every couple months just to continue their already approved treatment. Our bill - The Timely Care Act (AB 539) - will cut the red tape that often delays care so people can focus on their health, not on paperwork,” said Assemblymember Schiavo. “As someone who spent over a decade fighting for patients as a nurse advocate, I know how critical timely care is, and how much time is wasted by doctors having to spend time on paperwork rather than caring for patients. Reducing barriers to medically necessary care for both patients and physicians will make a real difference in people’s lives.”

AB 512 by Assemblymember John Harabedian (AD 41) requires health plans to respond to urgent prior authorization requests within 24 hours and respond to nonurgent requests within 48 hours. Currently, health plans have 72 hours for urgent requests and five days for nonurgent requests. This change will ensure more patients can receive care or appeal denials in a timely fashion.

“AB 512 is a crucial step toward improving patient access to timely care,” said Assemblymember Harabedian. “By shortening response times for both urgent and nonurgent prior authorization requests, we are ensuring that patients can receive the care they need when they need it most. This bill represents a dedication to putting patient well-being at the forefront of our healthcare system.”

CMA thanks its partners in the legislature for championing reforms to our broken prior authorization system. The Prioritizing Patients, Empowering Physicians bills are part of CMA’s sponsored bill package for the 2025 legislative session.

Over two-thirds (69%) of military injuries are cumulative microtraumatic injuries that result from overuse.","By V. Hauschild, MPH, Defense Health Agency-Public Health Public Affairs

Service members experience 25 million limited duty days annually due to injuries, most of which are musculoskeletal injuries, also known as MSKI.

When on limited duty status, a service member may not be able to maintain required training activities and may not be deployable. As a result, the combat readiness of the U.S. military forces is substantially reduced by MSKI, costing the Department of Defense billions of dollars annually.

“For decades, the data have consistently shown that MSKI are the primary reason for service members’ medical visits,” says Dr. Bruce Jones, a retired Army physician and current senior advisor to the Defense Health Agency-Public Health Clinical Public Health and Epidemiology Directorate in Aberdeen, Maryland. “Though MSKI most commonly occur in lower body areas such as the knees, legs, ankles and feet, approximately 20% of all military medically reported injuries are to upper extremity areas, such as to shoulders, elbows, wrists, hands and fingers.”

Upper extremity injuries require unique recovery treatments that are most effective when tailored to an individual’s injury, as well as their specific work and personal activities. This treatment is provided by military Occupational Therapists Practitioners, known as OTPs, who are trained to treat service members’ upper extremity injuries from shoulders to fingertips.

“The treatment of an upper extremity injury depends on many factors: how long ago the injury occurred, the overall health of the service member, and compliance with the treatment plan,” says U.S. Army Maj. Amanda Hetzler, an OTP currently assigned to DHA-Public Health in Aberdeen.

She points to evidence that early access to OT is the leading factor in reducing a patient’s recovery time.

“The sooner we can start working with an injured service member, the better outcomes can be,” says Hetzler.

What are common upper extremity injuries?

Military injury data indicate that among the upper extremities, the shoulder is the most commonly injured body area.

Some units may be at higher risk of these injuries. For example, an analysis of medical data found that compared to other service members, military paratroopers have been treated for more acute shoulder injuries, such as fractures, sprains or dislocations of the shoulder or acromioclavicular joint (where the shoulder and collarbone meet). The data also showed paratroopers were more likely to develop shoulder overuse injuries than non-paratroopers. Shoulder injuries can be more severe and require a longer recovery period than lower extremity injuries.

While Hetzler says she also often sees acute, or single incident, pain injuries to the wrist or hand caused by a fall on outstretched hands while a service member is running and carrying gear, most injuries she has seen in the military population are the result of overuse.

Overuse injuries occur from a repeated, low-intensity force over time that damages tendon, joint, ligament, muscle and/or skeletal tissue, overwhelming the tissue’s normal ability to recover. Over two-thirds (69%) of military injuries are cumulative microtraumatic injuries that result from overuse.

Hetzler describes other upper extremity overuse injuries commonly treated by OTs:

• Thumb and wrist pain, including de Quervain's Tenosynovitis and Gamer’s thumb: Also sometimes called de Quervain's tendinosis or de Quervain's tendinitis, this condition occurs when thumb tendons become inflamed and cause pain and swelling at the base of thumb into the side of the wrist or lower arm. Symptoms can include numbness and/or a sensation that your thumb is sticking when you try to move it.

• Elbow and forearm pain, especially Lateral Epicondylitis: Also referred to as elbow tendonitis or sometimes tennis elbow, this condition causes pain in the affected forearm when you’re trying to complete ordinary movements such as gripping or holding even relatively light objects, turning knobs, driving, typing, or shaking hands.

What causes upper body injuries?

“Overuse injuries can be attributed to various activities that require repetitive motion such as pushing, pulling, and lifting and can also be impacted by ergonomics, tool use, and the overall strength and condition of a person,” says U.S. Navy Lt. Cmdr. Emmy Hartley, an OTP currently assigned to Naval Hospital Pensacola, Florida.

Some upper body diagnoses such as ‘Gamer’s thumb’ are commonly given due to the many cases in the U.S. that are caused by excessive use of video game remote control devices and cell phones. The term ‘tennis elbow’ is frequently used because of the popularity of racquet sports that contribute to repetitive strain on the wrist, causing the condition. Although the condition ‘tennis elbow’ may be diagnosed for service members, it is rarely caused by tennis play within the military population.

“More relevant to the military, evidence has shown that certain occupations that require intense repetitive physical activity, such as shooting rifles, performing mechanic work, or carrying objects during military tasks, can increase the risk of certain upper body injuries,” says Hartley.

In addition to unique mission activities such as paratrooper duties, Hetzler recalls patients describing some examples of triggering military activities:

• Pushups

• Weightlifting (especially ‘snatching,’ which involves taking a wide grip on a weighted barbell, pulling it off the floor rapidly, and lifting the barbell over the head with arms outstretched in one continuous motion, placing stress on the wrist.)

• Lifting of gear (loading and unloading)

“While these activities are often critical to military training or duties, the patient can often not perform them while injured,” says Hetzler. “In addition, a key part of most OT treatment plans will require a recovery period where these activities should not be performed.”

What can you do to minimize the impact of an upper extremity injury?

“The best way to reduce the impact of an injury is to prevent it from occurring. Most injuries, especially overuse injuries, are preventable,” says Jones. “Various military resources are available to help service members target key injury risk factors and improve service member readiness by reducing injury risk.”

These resources can help service members avoid injuries while maximizing fitness, and allow early accessibility to an OTP. For example, some Army units are including Holistic Health and Fitness, known as H2F, teams into their brigade formations, while Navy and Marine units have the Navy Operational Fitness and Fueling System, or NOFFS.

“If you develop a MSKI or experience painful symptoms not yet limiting you, seek immediate care,” says Hetzler. “With delayed care or a lack of proper intervention, injuries can result in reduced readiness of the unit, limited military career progression or worse—permanent disability.”

Hetzler and Hartley also highlight that OTPs can provide activity analysis of specific tasks, such as lifting, pushups, and body mechanics, while the task is being performed. These analyses result in preventive education and training that can further reduce the risk of MSKI.

“The most important step is early diagnosis and referral to an OT who will help develop and monitor your treatment plan. Especially, don’t ignore pain in joints,” says Hetzler. “Once you are under the care of an OT, of course, you need to follow the treatment plan. This is the best way to reduce your chance of a longer recovery or permanent condition.”

The order published in the Official Gazette changes the legal regime of full dedication, extending the option of individual membership to doctors in establishments and services covered by the special medical career regime.

Thus, the full dedication regime can be applied to medical workers in the areas of primary health care, hospital care and pre-hospital emergency care, who express an interest in individually joining the regime, particularly in situations where it is not possible to join a Family Health Unit (USF) or an Integrated Responsibility Center (CRI).

It also applies to workers in the special medical career who perform functions in the Military Health System, as well as in prison establishments of the General Directorate of Reintegration and Prison Services.

General and family medicine specialists who provide care in organic units integrated into the SNS that do not correspond to USF or Personalized Health Care Units, namely in the areas of palliative care and dependencies and addictive behaviors, can also adhere to full dedication.

The decree-law published on November 07, 2023 had established the legal regime for full dedication in the NHS, applicable to multidisciplinary teams in family health units and in integrated responsibility centers.

It also provided for the possibility of individual membership by primary and hospital healthcare doctors who expressed an interest in this regard, particularly when they were unable to join a USF or a CRI.

“Despite this provision, doubts remain about the applicability of this individual membership in relation to some doctors”, reads the diploma approved today.

In this context, the Government considered it “essential to make a specific change to Decree-Law No. 103/2023, of 7 November”, to ensure that these professionals can adhere to the full-time dedication regime.

“The amendment will also make it possible to clearly define the obligations arising from this membership”, states the dispatch, highlighting that the structures representing medical workers were consulted.

The contractors are ensuring members will not be delayed this year with the TRICARE Dental Program.

""We're excited about the improvements the new contracts will bring in 2025, especially if you get specialty care in the TRICARE civilian network,"" said Tonya Utterback, referral management subject matter expert at the Defense Health Agency.

The United Concordia will still administer care, offering many members new services and lower costs.

TRICARE's New Dental Contract

TRICARE has brought a new contract, and it has also got three main improvements. Members will find more dentists near them, and they'll be able to choose, including specialists; they’ll pay lower monthly premiums and can now meet with dentists online for checkups, planning their care, and other basic services.

The TRICARE Dental Program is a voluntary dental plan. It's available to active duty family members, National Guard and Reserve members, and their family members. The United Concordia has dentists in all 50 United States, the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, Guam, and the U.S. Virgin Islands.

The monthly premiums will decrease with the new contract. The monthly premium depends on the sponsor's status (Active duty, Selected Reserve, or Individual Ready Reserve) and enrollment type.

The TRICARE Dental Program Handbook mentions that it is a pay-ahead program. This means members will begin paying the new rates in February for coverage starting in March.

How TRICARE Will Benefit Families

The new and improved TRICARE Dental Program will surely be beneficial for a lot of military families and members. May it be Veterans, Guards, or Reserve, all will be covered. Preventive care and checkups are included.

The high costs of dental care will no longer be a problem because the new contract has ensured that everyone gets proper treatment without breaking the bank. The new contract will also allow members to search for proper health care near their homes.

No hassle, improved communication, and better providers are also coming to light.

What to Expect in the New TRICARE Dental Program

TRICARE Dental Program is a voluntary insurance plan for members of the military. They now offer many families restorative services, cleanings, checkups, and dental surgeries.

TRICARE Dental Program's new benefits promise to deliver military families their well-deserved care, allowing them to have broad coverage and access.

On March 1st, members can expect a wide range of dental specialists, making finding the care that all members need easier. Plus, it's close to their home.

TRICARE Dental Coverage

TRICARE is the health care program for uniformed service members, retirees, and their families worldwide. Just like most private employers, dental insurance or dental coverage is separate from regular medical coverage.

Unlike TRICARE's medical coverage, which is automatic for every military dependent, TRICARE's dental coverage requires special enrollment. It's important to note that TRICARE dental coverage does not start automatically upon enrollment.

If you enroll in the TRICARE Dental Program by the 20th of February, your coverage will start on the first day of March. If enrollment happens after the 20th, you'll have to wait more than a month for your coverage to begin on the first day of the second month. The contract focuses on improved access to families and offers a big network of dental specialists to ensure that dental care is within every member's reach.

Enhanced coverage for preventive and essential services highlights the program's commitment to maintaining long-term oral health.

Zynex’s Disappointing Fourth Quarter Results

ZYXI share price depression stems from its disastrous 4Q 2024 earnings release. The Englewood, Colorado-based firm reported fourth-quarter 2024 revenue of $46.0 million, a roughly 2% year-over-year decline, falling short of Wall Street's expectations. The company also swung to a net loss of $0.02 per share, a stark contrast to the $0.04 net income per share reported in the same period last year.

The disappointing results reportedly prompted RBC Capital Markets to downgrade Zynex to Sector Perform from Outperform. According to news outlets, in a report to its clients, RBC analyst Shagun Singh cited a ""lack of visibility"" into the company's operations and commercial outlook, particularly concerning its relationship with Tricare, the military health program that represents a significant portion of Zynex's revenue.

Singh reportedly noted that Tricare, Zynex's largest customer, has temporarily suspended payments amid an ongoing review of prior claims. Singh added that the company's decision to withhold 2025 guidance and implement a 15% workforce reduction further compounded investor concerns. Singh revised RBC’s price target for Zynex shares to $5.50, down from $11.00, warning of a potential ""domino effect"" stemming from Tricare's payment suspension.

Zynex Securities Class Action

Adding to Zynex’s woes, a securities class action lawsuit has been filed in the District Court of Colorado, alleging that the company made false and misleading statements regarding its revenue recognition practices and its relationship with Tricare. The suit, captioned Tuncel v. Zynex, Inc., et al., seeks to represent investors who purchased Zynex securities between March 13, 2023, and March 11, 2025.

The complaint alleges that Zynex engaged in “oversupplying” customers with products, including electrodes, leading to inflated revenue figures. It further claims that this practice drew scrutiny from insurers, including Tricare, and that Zynex failed to disclose the potential for adverse consequences, such as removal from insurer networks and government penalties.

According to the complaint, revelations of Zynex's alleged practices surfaced with a June 4, 2024 report by medical journal STAAT detailing an ""oversupplying scheme"" involving excessive shipments of supplies and subsequent inflated billing. The report also indicated that insurers were ""kicking the company out of network.""

The truth allegedly emerged on March 11, 2025, when Zynex reported its dismal Q4 and FY 2024 financial results. The complaint highlights Zynex CEO Thomas Sandgaard’s attributing the fourth-quarter revenue shortfall to ""slower than normal payments from certain payers"" and the Tricare payment suspension.

Hagens Berman’s Investigation

Hagens Berman is investigating the alleged claims. “We are examining Zynex's financial reporting and business practices. We believe investors deserve a complete and transparent understanding of these events,” said Reed Kathrein, the Hagens Berman Partner leading the firm's probe.

After a long and successful career in the US Army, Terry Walsh embarked on a new mission to serve older adults in the senior living sector.

He retired as a colonel after a 22-year career in the US Army Medical Corps. Over his distinguished military career, he served in field units, jumped out of airplanes, worked a brief stint in the Pentagon, walked the Korean Demilitarized Zone, ran active-duty military hospitals and led a regional startup of the military’s TRICARE health insurance program.

After retiring from the military, Walsh moved into the private sector in healthcare and senior living. He joined the corporate office of Ascension Health in St. Louis in nonacute care operations, where he spearheaded company efforts to establish retail health clinics in pharmacies such as CVS and Walgreens and on-site employee health clinics in Kohl’s department store fulfillment centers.

In his first foray into senior living, Walsh worked on a project to improve the health system’s post-acute and long-term care operations, leading to the creation of Ascension Health Senior Care (now Ascension Living), one of the nation’s largest senior living and care companies.

In 2016, he joined Friendship Village, a large resort-style retirement community in the St. Louis area, starting out as executive director before becoming the organization’s president and CEO the following year.

For his leadership of Friendship Village, Walsh has earned local and national accolades while also overseeing a $200 million expansion project in 2020. He also has received praise and numerous awards for adopting innovative new technologies to improve the quality of resident care.

He is three times a Titan 100 CEO in St. Louis, in 2024 became a member of the inaugural Titan 100 St. Louis Hall of Fame.

Walsh previously served as hospital president and CEO of the US Army’s Ireland Hospital in Fort Knox, KY.

He holds a bachelor’s degree in biology from Westminster College and a master’s degree in healthcare administration from Baylor University.

This includes helping navigate the TriWest authorization waiver, which has been extended through April 30, 2025, for TRICARE Prime beneficiaries with a referral from their military or civilian primary care manager to seek outpatient care for covered services without referral approval from TriWest.

April 30 is also the date for those who have not updated payment information with TriWest to do so to ensure continued access for important services and avoid disenrollment.

Naval Hospital Bremerton and other military treatment facilities will continue to submit referrals for specialty care, as usual. If a patient is wanting continuing care or requesting a specific private sector provider, the following information is needed:

Name of facility or provider

Address, phone, fax, and National Provider Identifier (NPI) if available.

Note: this information should always be provided when requesting continuity of care referrals or when requesting a specific provider.

What patients should know about their referral status:

Specialty care will be provided at a military treatment facility such as Naval Hospital Bremerton, including Madigan Army Medical Center, when – and if - that specialty is available.

During this waiver period, NHB’s Referral Management Center will manually fax the referral, a provider letter and waiver letter to one specific private sector provider. The waiver serves as the authorization. No authorization will be accessible through the TriWest patient portal.

Beneficiaries should access their electronic health record MHS GENESIS patient portal [ https://myaccess.dmdc.osd.mil/identitymanagement/app/login ] to determine where their referral has been sent.

All eligible beneficiaries – active duty, retirees and dependents - can also call the Pacific Integrated Referral Management Center [PIRMAC] at 800-404-4506 for assistance to help navigate where their referral has been sent.

If a beneficiary desires a different private sector provider, they can take the referral and waiver letter to the provider to schedule an appointment. If the beneficiary experiences any barriers or issues, they can contact NHB Health Benefits Advisor, 360-475-4768.

Other important information to provide to all beneficiaries:

All beneficiaries should consider also setting up a portal with TriWest by accessing www.tricare-west.com. This will enable them to see their referrals and authorizations and will eventually allow them to change a provider without calling TriWest or NHB RMC.

Beneficiaries can also contact TriWest, 1-888-874-9378.

TRICARE, the healthcare program that serves military personnel, retirees, and their families, is currently available in Puerto Rico through the TRICARE Overseas Program (TOP).
Under the TRICARE Area Office for Latin America and Canada, Puerto Rico offers several health plan options such as TRICARE Prime Remote, TRICARE Select, and TRICARE Reserve Select.
However, because Puerto Rico is excluded from the full TRICARE Prime network, beneficiaries on the island face significant barriers to accessing care.","WASHINGTON, D.C. – Puerto Rico Resident Commissioner Pablo José Hernández has introduced the TRICARE Equality Act. This legislation directs the U.S. Department of Defense (DOD) to improve TRICARE Prime access and travel benefits for Puerto Rico veterans. The bill also requires coordination between the Federal Electronic Health Record Modernization Office and Puerto Rico’s Department of Health to share health data. Hernandez is joined by U.S. Representatives Julia Brownley (D-Calif.), Eleanor Holmes Norton (D-D.C.), and Hank Johnson (D-Ga.) as original cosponsors of the bill.

“Our veterans and military families in Puerto Rico have sacrificed just as much as their counterparts on the mainland, and they deserve equal access to the healthcare benefits they’ve earned. The TRICARE Equality Act will help close the unacceptable gaps in care faced by our servicemembers, retirees, and their families on the island. By improving TRICARE Prime access, expanding travel benefits, and ensuring better coordination of health data, this bill takes a critical step toward treating Puerto Rico’s military community with the dignity and fairness they deserve,” said Hernández.

TRICARE, the healthcare program that serves military personnel, retirees, and their families, is currently available in Puerto Rico through the TRICARE Overseas Program (TOP). Approximately 38,000 individuals in Puerto Rico rely on TRICARE, including active duty service members and their families, members of the National Guard and Reserve, and around 24,000 military retirees and their families. Under the TRICARE Area Office for Latin America and Canada, Puerto Rico offers several health plan options such as TRICARE Prime Remote, TRICARE Select, and TRICARE Reserve Select.

However, because Puerto Rico is excluded from the full TRICARE Prime network, beneficiaries on the island face significant barriers to accessing care. Many are forced to pay upfront for services and submit claims for reimbursement later, encounter gaps in access to specialty care that often require travel to the mainland, and endure delays in receiving necessary treatments.

This legislation addresses these disparities by directing the U.S. Department of Defense (DOD) to improve TRICARE Prime access and travel benefits for Puerto Rico’s military community, ensuring they receive the same level of healthcare access as their counterparts on the mainland. It also requires the Federal Electronic Health Record Modernization Office to coordinate with Puerto Rico’s Department of Health to share health data and improve care delivery.

Hernandez is joined by U.S. Representatives Julia Brownley (D-Calif.), Eleanor Holmes Norton (D-D.C.), and Hank Johnson (D-Ga.) as original cosponsors of the bill.

Zynex’s Disappointing Fourth Quarter Results

ZYXI share price depression stems from its disastrous 4Q 2024 earnings release. The Englewood, Colorado-based firm reported fourth-quarter 2024 revenue of $46.0 million, a roughly 2% year-over-year decline, falling short of Wall Street's expectations. The company also swung to a net loss of $0.02 per share, a stark contrast to the $0.04 net income per share reported in the same period last year.

The disappointing results reportedly prompted RBC Capital Markets to downgrade Zynex to Sector Perform from Outperform. According to news outlets, in a report to its clients, RBC analyst Shagun Singh cited a ""lack of visibility"" into the company's operations and commercial outlook, particularly concerning its relationship with Tricare, the military health program that represents a significant portion of Zynex's revenue.

Singh reportedly noted that Tricare, Zynex's largest customer, has temporarily suspended payments amid an ongoing review of prior claims. Singh added that the company's decision to withhold 2025 guidance and implement a 15% workforce reduction further compounded investor concerns. Singh revised RBC’s price target for Zynex shares to $5.50, down from $11.00, warning of a potential ""domino effect"" stemming from Tricare's payment suspension.

Zynex Securities Class Action

Adding to Zynex’s woes, a securities class action lawsuit has been filed in the District Court of Colorado, alleging that the company made false and misleading statements regarding its revenue recognition practices and its relationship with Tricare. The suit, captioned Tuncel v. Zynex, Inc., et al., seeks to represent investors who purchased Zynex securities between March 13, 2023, and March 11, 2025.

The complaint alleges that Zynex engaged in “oversupplying” customers with products, including electrodes, leading to inflated revenue figures. It further claims that this practice drew scrutiny from insurers, including Tricare, and that Zynex failed to disclose the potential for adverse consequences, such as removal from insurer networks and government penalties.

According to the complaint, revelations of Zynex's alleged practices surfaced with a June 4, 2024 report by medical journal STAAT detailing an ""oversupplying scheme"" involving excessive shipments of supplies and subsequent inflated billing. The report also indicated that insurers were ""kicking the company out of network.""

The truth allegedly emerged on March 11, 2025, when Zynex reported its dismal Q4 and FY 2024 financial results. The complaint highlights Zynex CEO Thomas Sandgaard’s attributing the fourth-quarter revenue shortfall to ""slower than normal payments from certain payers"" and the Tricare payment suspension.

Hagens Berman’s Investigation

Hagens Berman is investigating the alleged claims. “We are examining Zynex's financial reporting and business practices. We believe investors deserve a complete and transparent understanding of these events,” said Reed Kathrein, the Hagens Berman Partner leading the firm's probe.
