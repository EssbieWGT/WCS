“We don’t know where this ends,” said Janice Smith, 67, who has multiple sclerosis and worries the stress will aggravate the autoimmune disorder.
Anxiety has kept Harve Smith, who served in the Navy for 15 years until 1994, from sleeping through the night.
“It just kept waking me up,” said Harve Smith, a former lieutenant commander.
The Defense Health Agency said the new contract would “improve health care delivery, quality, and access” for U.S. beneficiaries.","A Navy veteran and his wife said they were blindsided when Tricare, the military’s health care program, rescinded over $100,000 in medical claims it had approved and paid several years ago.

Harve Smith, 71, received a $470 bill in January for dermatologist visits in 2020. He thought it was a one-off error until he discovered that Tricare had retroactively denied 26 more claims for a total of about $3,000 worth of services it had already reimbursed providers for since 2019, when he first enrolled in Tricare For Life, a plan for Tricare-eligible people who have Medicare.

Tricare also reversed approvals for at least 10 claims, totaling about $100,400, for his wife, Janice, in the same time frame, while nine other claims that had once been marked as completed are being re-processed, according to records from her Tricare portal, which NBC News reviewed.

“We don’t know where this ends,” said Janice Smith, 67, who has multiple sclerosis and worries the stress will aggravate the autoimmune disorder.

The couple, who live in Fallon, Nevada, said they would have to use their retirement funds or remortgage their home, which they fully own, to clear the debt. Anxiety has kept Harve Smith, who served in the Navy for 15 years until 1994, from sleeping through the night.

“It just kept waking me up,” said Harve Smith, a former lieutenant commander. “Did I do something wrong?”

It is unclear what prompted the reversals, which appear to be legal under federal law, according to two health care attorneys.

In Nevada, recoupment time frames are usually set by contracts between private health insurers and providers, Las Vegas-based attorney Ayesha Mehdi said. The contracts often allow insurers to recoup payments within a year or two and sometimes four years, she said.

But because federal law is stronger than state law, Mehdi said, Tricare, a federal program, is allowed to rescind payments under its regulations, which permit recovery for up to 10 years in cases of overpayment or mistakes.

The Defense Health Agency, which oversees Tricare, did not say whether it had overpaid or made an error or whether the couple’s case was unique. Spokesperson Brenda Campbell said that it cannot comment publicly on individual health cases but that it would work with the Smiths to investigate further.

Health Net Federal Services, the former contractor for the Tricare west region, also said it could not comment on specific cases, citing health privacy laws, but it said it is “actively looking into the matter.”

TriWest Healthcare Alliance, which took over the contract this year, deferred comment to Health Net, which it said is responsible for processing and paying claims before Jan. 1. TriWest said it has not recouped or tried to recoup any payments from the Smiths and is not allowed to take such actions under its contract with the Defense Health Agency.

After having spent weeks calling the agencies and being bounced around between departments, the Smiths said, they have not gotten clarity.

Meanwhile, the $470 bill from the dermatologist has already gone to collections. The Feb. 7 collections notification, which was reviewed by NBC News, instructs Harve Smith to pay the balance within the next 30 days or face adverse credit reporting.

The Smiths said they do not plan to pay the bills out of pocket until they have confirmation that it is their responsibility to do so.

Documents in Harve Smith’s Tricare portal, which NBC News also reviewed, show that Tricare did issue payments to the dermatologist in 2020.

Janice Smith said: “It has been so stressful, and it is so scary. We can’t be the only ones in this position.”

Millions of service members, retirees, their families and network providers nationwide have felt cascading disruptions following Tricare’s contract changes this year.

About 16,000 health care providers on the East Coast alone have not been paid this year, officials said, forcing many to drop Tricare patients, reduce their hours or consider closing their clinics. On the West Coast, federal officials said, beneficiaries are struggling with a host of issues, including long wait times at call centers and stalled referrals and authorizations.

On Jan. 1, TriWest began managing Tricare benefits on the West Coast and in six Eastern states that were reallocated to the west region. The Defense Health Agency said the new contract would “improve health care delivery, quality, and access” for U.S. beneficiaries. But it has acknowledged that several challenges have cropped up nationwide since then.

The Smiths said it took weeks of calling Tricare before anyone picked up the phone. During one attempt, they said, they waited on hold for over two hours.

“I was so exhausted. I just started crying,” Janice Smith said.

She said they called Tricare For Life, which is Tricare’s Medicare program, but were redirected to at least three other numbers. When they finally reached a representative for the military’s Defense Enrollment Eligibility Reporting System database, which holds information for every service member, Janice Smith said, they were told the officials had to manually fix her husband’s records.

The Smiths said database system did not elaborate on what was wrong with his records or what caused the apparent error. They were told to complete a Tricare form asking to reinstate their enrollment, even though they did not know whether they had been removed.

In the meantime, they do not know whether they currently have health care coverage and whether they are on the hook to repay all of the claims out of pocket.

Janice Smith said Tricare had initially approved her and her husband’s services, which included brain scans to monitor her condition, hip replacement surgery, physical therapy and annual checkups.

“We’re not going to pay. We are not in the wrong,” she said. “We were covered. We had insurance.”

The Smiths, who have been married for 42 years, had been enjoying their retirement and spending their time visiting their daughters in Hawaii and Virginia.

They said the claims reversals, which have triggered at least two medical bills so far, have caused them to live more frugally, limiting their travel and even lunch dates.

“We were the epitome of footloose and fancy-free,” Janice Smith said. “Now we have this looming over us.”","https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_nbcnews-fp-1200-630,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2025-03/250312-3x2-smith-family-vl-130p-cf927e.jpg",N,-1.0,2025-03-13 18:50:26.772053

Keep reading to learn about provider types and how to find a provider.

Network providers

Are you wondering which type of provider you should see? There are two main types of TRICARE providers: Network and non-network providers. Network providers have signed agreements to work directly with TRICARE, as described in the TRICARE Choices in the United States Handbook. Seeing a network provider has several important benefits. Network providers:

Charge lower costs for your care and won’t surprise you with extra bills above what TRICARE allows

Take care of filing your claims, which means less paperwork for you

Have agreed to follow TRICARE’s rules and procedures for your care

Network providers are often your most affordable and convenient choice. You’ll only have to pay your cost-share to a network provider.

Non-network providers

Non-network providers can treat TRICARE beneficiaries, but they don’t have direct agreements with TRICARE. There are two types of non-network providers you should know about: participating non-network providers and non-participating providers.

Participating non-network providers will:

Accept TRICARE’s payment rate for your care

Only bill you for your share of the costs

Handle your claims paperwork for you

Non-participating providers might:

Charge you more than what TRICARE allows, resulting in higher out-of-pocket costs

Ask for full payment before they treat you

Expect you to file your own claims

Important: Remember to ask non-network providers if they’re TRICARE-authorized before getting care—even if they’ve accepted TRICARE in the past. If they aren’t TRICARE-authorized, TRICARE won’t pay for any part of your claim.

How to find a provider

You have several options to search for providers:

Use the Find a Doctor search tool.

Look through the complete provider network directories on the TRICARE website.

If you live in the West Region, your regional contractor is now TriWest Healthcare Alliance. You can access the TriWest provider directory.

If you live in the East Region, check out the Humana Military network provider directory.

If you live overseas, use the International SOS provider directory to locate nearby providers.

Note: TRICARE has a Preferred Provider Network in the Philippines. Non-network providers in the Philippines must be certified to be covered by TRICARE, except for emergency services. Providers in the PPN:

Accept network copayments and cost-shares

File claims for you

Learn more about getting care in the Philippines on the TRICARE website.

Rules for different TRICARE plans

Your TRICARE plan determines the rules for which providers you can see. Here’s what you need to know about each plan.

If you have TRICARE Select, TRICARE Reserve Select, TRICARE Retired Reserve, or TRICARE Young Adult - Select Option, you can:

Visit any provider who is approved by TRICARE

If you have TRICARE Prime, including TRICARE Young Adult - Prime Option:

You get routine care from an assigned or selected primary care manager.

Your PCM may be at a military hospital or clinic or a civilian TRICARE network provider.

You’ll need a referral for specialty care and some diagnostic services.

Note: Do you live in the West Region? There is a referral approval waiver in place through March 31. This means you still need to get a referral for specialty care, but you don’t need to wait for TriWest to approve the referral before seeing the specialist.

You can use the point-of-service option to see a non-network provider, but you may have higher costs.

Important: Do you live in the West Region? Through March 31, you won’t have to pay POS fees for care received from a non-network provider. The Defense Health Agency has issued a waiver for POS fees, as long as the provider is TRICARE-authorized. Starting April 1, if the provider is still a non-network provider and isn’t named on your referral or pre-authorization, you’ll need to pay POS fees.

If you have TRICARE Prime Remote:

You can see non-network providers if no network providers practice in your area.

If you have TRICARE For Life:

Seeing a Medicare participating provider is the most cost-effective option. Check out the Medicare provider directory to find participating providers near you.

Medicare pays first.

You can see any TRICARE-authorized provider.

Keeping costs low

You can take several steps to keep your healthcare costs down:

Choose network providers whenever possible.

Check if you need TRICARE’s approval before getting treatment.

Ask providers if they’re TRICARE-authorized before making appointments.

Learn and follow your plan’s specific rules about getting care.",https://media.defense.gov/2025/Mar/13/2003666774/1920/1080/0/250313-O-D0202-1001.JPG,N,0.0,2025-03-13 15:50:27.668812

Ultimately, it was taxpayers who footed the bill for fraud and false claims with government contractors. Taxpayers should never pay for shoddy services, especially not when it comes to healthcare and protecting personal and sensitive data relating to military members and their families.

The Allegations Against Health Net Federal Services, LLC and Centene Corporation

According to the DOJ, parent corporation Centene and its subsidiary Health Net Federal Services (HNFS) failed to meet these minimum cybersecurity protocols between the period of 2015 and 2018 while providing data management services to the U.S. Department of Defense through its administration of TRICARE. HNFS may have exposed U.S. service members’ personal and health data, as well as that of their families, due to failing to scan for known vulnerabilities and patching known security flaws. The networks and systems maintained by HNFS during this three year period were reported by third party security auditors as well as the company’s own internal audit department for being inadequate in terms of:

Asset management

Access controls

Flawed configuration settings

Weak firewalls or lack of firewalls in use

End-of-life hardware and software in place

Lack of patch management

Vulnerability scanning

Shoddy password policies

HFNS not only allegedly failed to install updates from vendors that would have countered known threats; they also allegedly falsely certified compliance with annual reports to DHA in order to keep their government contract with TRICARE. In order to resolve these allegations, the company Centene Corporation, which acquired all shares of HFNS as well as its liabilities, has agreed to pay $11,253,400. The matter was resolved in collaboration with the U.S. Department of Justice Civil Division’s Commercial Litigation Branch (Fraud Section) and the U.S. Attorney’s Office for the Eastern District of California, as well as with assistance from the DoD Office of Inspector General, the DCIS, Cyber Field Office Western Region, the Inspector General’s Office of Audits, Cyberspace Operations Directorate, and the DoD’s Defense Contract Management Agency, Defense Industrial Base Cybersecurity Assessment Center.

What Is TRICARE?

TRICARE is a federal health insurance program administered by the U.S. Department of Defense and its contracts. TRICARE provides healthcare coverage to qualifying members of the U.S. military and their families, including:

Active duty service members and their families

National Guard and Reserve members and families

Medal of Honor recipients and their families

Survivors

Children

Former spouses

TRICARE is similar to Medicare in that it is a primary health insurance provider funded by taxpayer dollars and administered by a federal agency. While Medicare covers older Americans ages 65 and up, TRICARE provides medical, dental, and pharmacy coverage for U.S. military members, veterans, and family members. Because of this, TRICARE also maintains personal and sensitive data for military members, including some confidential location information for active duty personnel. Like all health data, TRICARE records include HIPAA-protected information and other confidential information, which can be exposed to data breaches by criminal hackers and contractors who do not take their cybersecurity obligations seriously. TRICARE breaches are especially troubling because they can lead to the unlawful dissemination of protected information that compromises individual health privacy and potentially national security.

Federal Healthcare Programs Are Vulnerable to Cybersecurity Breaches

Acting U.S. Attorney Michele Beckwith for the Eastern District of California spoke about the HNFS settlement, saying “Safeguarding sensitive government information, particularly when it relates to the health and well-being of millions of service members and their families, is of paramount importance. When HNFS failed to uphold its cybersecurity obligations, it didn’t just breach its contract with the government, it breached its duty to the people who sacrifice so much in defense of our nation.”

Both healthcare and defense spending for government contracts are two of the most at-risk areas for fraud, waste, and abuse. Taxpayers lose billions of dollars every year to government contractors and healthcare organizations that take advantage of federal healthcare programs like Medicare, Medicaid, and TRICARE, with an estimated 10% of program expenses at risk. Meanwhile, the Government Accountability Office reports that the U.S. Department of Defense is particularly vulnerable to false or fraudulent claims involving overbilling, billing for work never performed or services not rendered to beneficiaries, fraudulent bid submissions, non-competitive bids, the provisions of substandard parts or services, and the failure to disclose data breaches and other cybersecurity risks.

How Whistleblowers Can Protect Americans Through the False Claims Act

Under the U.S. Department of Justice’s Civil Cyber Fraud Initiative, private companies that contract with the federal government are obligated to uphold certain minimum cybersecurity standards. When they fail to do so, or falsely certify compliance with cybersecurity requirements, they can be held accountable under the False Claims Act for treble damages and penalties to the federal government. Through a qui tam lawsuit, whistleblowers who report on these kinds of violations can also receive a percentage of the government’s total recovery. These percentages can range from 10% to 30% of the final settlement. The False Claims Act imposes treble damages upon violators, as well as individual penalties for each false claims of up to $13,946 to $27,894 per violation. The law also allows whistleblowers (known as relators) who meet certain eligibility requirements and are the first to report cybersecurity fraud, government contractor fraud including DOD fraud, or healthcare fraud a reward for their inside information.

Whistleblowers can come from all walks of life and may include current or former employees of any potential defendant such as employees of government contractors, health care entities, or any regulated company, non-employees (examiners, competitors, clients, customers, auditors, reviewers, consultants, industry experts), anyone with evidence and knowledge of fraud involving government money. As long as you come forward willingly and in a timely manner you may be able to bring a qui tam case with the help of a qui tam lawyer and recover a reward. There are also additional protections for employees, including cybersecurity professionals, who speak up. These may include:

The option to initially report anonymously through a qui tam law firm

A federal right of action to sue for reinstatement if you are fired from your company as a result of your protected disclosure

Up to double back pay with interest from the period during which you were demoted, suspended, or let go

Possible front pay, in cases where reinstatement is not possible

Additional damages and attorneys’ fees.",https://yr2khqfq.cdn.imgeng.in/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/soldier-in-doctor-office.jpeg,N,-1.0,2025-03-13 18:50:37.798178

However, US and foreign commercial companies covet those frequencies for providing high-speed wireless service to civilian and military users alike.","WASHINGTON — Federal Communications Commission Chair Brendan Carr announced today the launch of the Council for National Security within the agency aimed at fending off foreign bad actors, particularly China.

“Today, the country faces a persistent and constant threat from foreign adversaries, particularly the CCP [Chinese Communist Party],” Carr said in a news release today. “These bad actors are always exploring ways to breach our networks, devices, and technology ecosystem. It is more important than ever that the FCC remain vigilant and protect Americans and American companies from these threats.”

The council will be headed by Adam Chan, a former associate at the Boyden Gray PLLC law firm, per the release.

Today’s announcement outlines three focus areas for the council. The first is to reduce the US’s dependencies on foreign adversaries regarding tech and telecommunications supply chains. Second is to “mitigate” the US’s vulnerabilities to surveillance, espionage and cyberattacks. Lastly, the council will “ensure” that the US outpaces China in its race to develop and deploy “critical technologies” such as 5G, 6G, artificial intelligence, satellites and space, quantum, robotics, autonomous systems, and the internet of things.

The FCC and the National Telecommunications and Information Administration (NTIA) are the two organizations responsible for setting US spectrum policy, and governing which users get access when to what bandwidths for what functions. The FCC regulates commercial spectrum usage while the NTIA is responsible for advocating for spectrum usage for military departments.

The announcement comes against the background of a tug-of-war between commercial providers and the Defense Department over usage of key parts of the spectrum, specifically between the 1 GhZ (gigahertz) to 6 GHz range, which makes up the 3.1-3.45 and 3.5 GHz S-band — widely considered to be the “Goldilocks” zone of the spectrum.

The DoD has contended that this part of the spectrum band is essential for its various satellite communications, radars and navigation systems. However, US and foreign commercial companies covet those frequencies for providing high-speed wireless service to civilian and military users alike.

When it comes to the fight over the spectrum, John Sherman, former DoD chief information officer and now dean of the Bush School of Government and Public Service at Texas A&M University, previously told Breaking Defense that “it is a zero sum game” for the DoD.

“There is finite spectrum, and the physics of the spectrum, about the desirability of the lower [3 GHz band] both for our target acquisition radars and for 5G, this makes it very difficult,” he said.",https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/05/220524_antenna_network_GettyImages-1306156001-scaled-e1660843825841-1024x576.jpg,N,0.0,2025-03-13 15:50:32.497445

One of the main benefits of Scheduled Virtual Visits is that it can save patients time and enables them to access care when it is convenient for them.
“I feel like Scheduled Virtual Visits capability is pretty easy to use and it flows,” said Rachel Milnark, a registered nurse in the occupational health clinic at Munson.
Another provider in the occupational health section uses Scheduled Virtual Visits to complete the “Part 2” portion of occupational health exams for preplacement and replacement physicals for employees on post.
Some conditions suitable for Scheduled Virtual Visits may include skin conditions, urinary and sinus infections, pink eye, review of test results and specialist reports, medication management, cold and flu, and follow-ups.","FORT LEAVENWORTH, Kansas, -- A new virtual healthcare delivery platform available from Munson Army Health Center called Scheduled Virtual Visits is already making a positive difference during its initial trial.

“We are in the process of a very deliberate roll-out of this virtual health platform and so far, the feedback has been very good from both patients and staff,” said Col. Jolanda L.J. Walker, director of Munson Army Health Center, which adopted the application last month. The virtual healthcare technology is part of the Defense Health Agency care model called My Military Health.

One of the main benefits of Scheduled Virtual Visits is that it can save patients time and enables them to access care when it is convenient for them. All it takes is a smartphone, tablet, or computer with internet, video and audio capabilities.

“It is not a replacement for in-person health care, but an additional option for our beneficiaries to choose from when medically appropriate,” said Walker. “Patients may always choose an in-person visit if they prefer.”

Munson is currently using the platform for behavioral health and occupational health appointments.

Instead of patients coming to the health center, they can see their care team using this secure technology.

“I feel like Scheduled Virtual Visits capability is pretty easy to use and it flows,” said Rachel Milnark, a registered nurse in the occupational health clinic at Munson. “All the patient has to do is click on the link we provide when it is time for their appointment, and they will be virtually connected to their provider.”

Milnark has been using the system to complete annual screening for childcare providers at the installation’s day care facilities.

“This new system allows CYS staff to take care of occupational health appointments with minimal disruption. They can complete a 15-minute requirement in 15 minutes, rather than leaving the childcare facility, traveling to Munson to visit the occupational health clinic in person and eventually heading back. That can take a lot longer,” said Milnark.

Another provider in the occupational health section uses Scheduled Virtual Visits to complete the “Part 2” portion of occupational health exams for preplacement and replacement physicals for employees on post.

“We have sped up the process from weeks to days for some exams, because the patient is only required to be here one time versus having to come in multiple times,” said Maj. Meredith Steggerda, Munson’s chief of Public Health, which includes the occupational health mission for the installation.

“I’m seeing a lot of good opportunities for this,” said Walker.

She said that she intends to expand the platform into the primary care setting soon.

“We are currently exploring all the possibilities and establishing protocols for implementation at our level -- ensuring our providers have the training and technology to use the platform as intended,” said Walker.

Some conditions suitable for Scheduled Virtual Visits may include skin conditions, urinary and sinus infections, pink eye, review of test results and specialist reports, medication management, cold and flu, and follow-ups.

About Paxlovid

Paxlovid is a prescription-only oral antiviral medication containing nirmatrelvir and ritonavir. It treats mild to moderate COVID-19 symptoms and is particularly effective if you are unvaccinated.

Nirmatrelvir helps to stop a key enzyme from working that the coronavirus needs to multiply. Ritonavir slows the breakdown of nirmatrelvir, enhancing its effects.

Paxlovid reduced the risk of hospitalization or death from the SARS-CoV-2 Omicron variants in older adults by 44%.

It is important to discuss Paxlovid with your doctor or healthcare professional, as there are many possible drug interactions.

Additionally, you may experience side effects when taking Paxlovid, which could include:

allergic reactions

a change in your taste

diarrhea

headache

liver conditions

high blood pressure (hypertension)

Planners are ready to begin aligning medical groups and medical Airmen under AFMEDCOM.
“The readiness mission has always been at the heart of the Air Force Medical Service,” said Lt. Gen. John DeGoes, U.S. Air Force and Space Force Surgeon General.
“Medical Airmen are essential to ensuring Airmen and Guardians are ready to fight, and Medical Airmen are responsible for returning injured personnel to the fight so operations may continue.
The Air Force Medical Service is a critical component of readiness and ensuring commanders have the medical support they need in garrison and operationally is essential.”","The Air Force Medical Command achieved its initial operational capability March 12, 2025.

This milestone signifies activation or establishment of the Department of Air Force’s newest direct reporting unit headquarters, two intermediate medical readiness commands, and six of seven medical wings. Planners are ready to begin aligning medical groups and medical Airmen under AFMEDCOM.

“This is a historic moment,” said Maj. Gen. Sean Collins, AFMEDCOM commander. “It has taken an incredible amount of effort from multiple organizations to reach this point. Our focus to align our Airmen medics and medical support staff under their respective medical wings while delivering operational medical support to the warfighter will continue.”

DAF planners have been working to establish AFMEDCOM since the concept was approved in 2023. DAF leaders sought to reshape the operational medical capability and support to the warfighter while improving its partnership with the Defense Health Agency to provide quality health care to beneficiaries.

“The readiness mission has always been at the heart of the Air Force Medical Service,” said Lt. Gen. John DeGoes, U.S. Air Force and Space Force Surgeon General. “Anyone can deliver health care, but if we’re in uniform, the health care we deliver and the health care we support must be operationally relevant, on the ground, air or space.”

AFMEDCOM represents the DAF’s operational medical capability - medical Airmen who are organized, trained and equipped to be an organic part of the DAF’s warfighting force elements. As the DAF optimizes for enhanced warrior readiness, its medical forces must be ready to provide the required support, said DeGoes.

“Whether at peace or during combat operations, the Department of Air Force’s power and strength are unrivaled - it’s fueled by the best military training and equipment, but injuries occur,” said Chief Master Sgt. James Woods, Chief, Medical Enlisted Force. “Medical Airmen are essential to ensuring Airmen and Guardians are ready to fight, and Medical Airmen are responsible for returning injured personnel to the fight so operations may continue. That is the primary focus in all we do … we ensure Airmen and Guardians are ready for operations.”

AFMEDCOM’s primary purpose is focused on the warfighter in garrison and contingency operations, AFMEDCOM will continue DAF’s partnership with the DHA. This partnership will ensure and enhance readiness for Airmen, Guardians and their families by receiving timely and quality medical care, whether assigned to installations supported by large or small military treatment facilities. It will also support DHA’s congressionally mandated commitments to serve the larger beneficiary population.

AFMEDCOM leadership, working with DAF partners, have established a well-coordinated inter-command transfer sequence. This ICT will align medical Airmen and units into the Command. At final operating capability, AFMEDCOM will be the largest DRU in DAF providing command and control of its assigned personnel to execute DAF and AF/SG readiness requirements.

“We’re taking a conditions-based approach to ensure the effective transfer of personnel and responsibilities of AFMEDCOM,” said DeGoes. “We’ve had extensive conversations with leadership at all levels. The Air Force Medical Service is a critical component of readiness and ensuring commanders have the medical support they need in garrison and operationally is essential.”",https://d1ldvf68ux039x.cloudfront.net/thumbs/photos/2202/7059355/1000w_q95.jpg,N,0.0,2025-03-13 11:50:18.651677

Tricare, TriWest and Humana Military have taken some actions to start to address the issues.","This article by Karen Jowers originally appeared on Military Times, the nation's largest independent newsroom dedicated to covering the military and veteran community.

A retired Marine staff sergeant recently took steps to ensure he and his wife don’t lose their health care coverage after his allotment for Tricare payments was mistakenly stopped during the military’s transition to the new contracts in January.

Russ Clark is worried that other people have been affected, too, and could unknowingly be at risk of losing their coverage.

He’s concerned that other beneficiaries aren’t checking their pay statements from the Defense Finance and Accounting Service or their bank statements and could lose coverage if their allotment has also been discontinued.

“Others may not have noticed the allotment being stopped, as it was at the same time we got our [Cost of Living Adjustment] pay increase, so someone may be thinking that the increase in the monthly paycheck was just the COLA increase,” Clark told Military Times.

[TELL US: Have You Faced Health Care Access Barriers? Share Your Story With MOAA]

Certain beneficiaries pay for Tricare Prime, Tricare Select, Tricare Young Adult, Tricare Reserve Select and Tricare Retired Reserve plans. Clark pays for Tricare Prime coverage.

The problem came about during the Jan. 1 transition of Tricare West Region beneficiaries from the previous contractor, Health Net Federal Services, to the new one, TriWest Healthcare Alliance. Tricare officials repeatedly assured West Region beneficiaries who make recurring payments by allotment that their information would be transferred automatically.

That wasn’t true for Clark.

Clark’s December pay statement showed his allotment to Tricare was stopped. During calls to Tricare and DFAS, they “assured me that I didn’t have anything to worry about,” he said.

As of March 7, the allotment has yet to be restarted. He has been making payments online to ensure he maintains coverage.

“I will pay month to month until I feel certain that DFAS won’t start this allotment again,” Clark said.

In a few months, he plans to set up auto pay using a credit card.

“We certainly apologize for any inconvenience caused by any issue with payment,” officials with the Defense Health Agency said in an email response to questions. “That said, this doesn’t seem to be a widespread issue, but for anyone who may be having issues with their payment by allotment ... check with your respective managed care support contractor.”

The contractors are TriWest Healthcare Alliance in the West Region and Humana Military in the East Region. Information wasn’t available from TriWest officials regarding the allotments, and DFAS officials referred the questions to Tricare.

[RELATED: MOAA's TRICARE Guide]

Military Times heard from other beneficiaries who faced a problem with their Tricare payments that differed from Clark’s. They previously made Tricare payments by credit card and suddenly, allotments started coming out of their paychecks without prior notification — and without their authorization.

These problems are aside from those experienced by beneficiaries who previously made their Tricare payments by electronic fund transfer, credit card or debit card. Those beneficiaries are required to set up their payments with TriWest because the sensitive financial information can’t be transferred between the contractors.

But many of those beneficiaries have encountered problems setting up their recurring payments. So, Tricare extended the deadline to March 31 for beneficiaries to input their recurring payment information. Those who miss this deadline will lose coverage back to Jan. 1, Tricare officials have warned. Beneficiaries looking to update TriWest with their payment information should visit www.tricare.mil/west.

The transition to the new contracts has been a troubled one for many military families and health care providers. Families have experienced difficulties with setting up their payments, finding in-network health care providers and getting referrals and authorizations processed. They’ve also endured long wait times with the TriWest call center.

In the East Region, health care providers have faced problems with receiving reimbursements, putting some at risk of closing their doors. A number have dropped Tricare patients because of the lack of payments.

Tricare, TriWest and Humana Military have taken some actions to start to address the issues.

TRICARE’s problems go beyond ASHA members. Several thousand TRICARE providers from many different specialties are struggling to provide care while patients deal with long wait times and delayed authorizations.

What ASHA Advocacy Is Doing

The ASHA Advocacy team is deeply concerned about this situation and knows that providers cannot continue to provide services when they cannot get paid or file claims. We are working to help ASHA members resolve these issues.

ASHA Advocacy collected stories from over 150 ASHA members and used this information to send letters to TRICARE West, TRICARE East, and the Defense Health Agency. ASHA met with TriWest Health Alliance on March 5 and stressed that these problems are putting providers in dire straits. Many have had to discontinue services for TRICARE patients and are unable to accept new TRICARE patients. Others are taking out personal loans to make payroll and in some cases shuttering their practices.

TriWest Health Alliance shared that it has hired hundreds of new employees to clear the claims backlog and respond to provider inquiries. ASHA Advocacy will continue to push for timely and efficient claims processing.

We are working closely with other health care provider associations to elevate our voice on this issue. We’re also sharing your stories with interested lawmakers who are tackling the issue in Congress.

“The Walter Reed we’re excited to get behind now saved her life.” He pushed back against the notion that private-sector healthcare is always superior.
“The family we have here at Walter Reed and the care that you receive here [show] our commitment,” he said.
“As we go forward, we want to make sure you have the resources to do what you need to do,” Selnick assured Walter Reed staff.","BETHESDA, Md. — Senior Department of Defense officials engaged directly with Walter Reed National Military Medical Center staff during a Senior Leaders Forum on March 7, addressing concerns ranging from military medical readiness to workforce reductions and efficiency improvements.

Darin Selnick, Performing the Duties of the Under Secretary of Defense for Personnel and Readiness, and Dr. Stephen Ferrara, Acting Assistant Secretary of Defense for Health Affairs, fielded questions and reinforced Walter Reed's critical role in military healthcare.

Mr. Selnick said it’s important for leaders to conduct site visits and listen to feedback from staff. “Health care equals military readiness,” he said.

Walter Reed’s leadership, including Director U.S. Navy Capt. Melissa C. Austin, underscored the institution’s role as the military health system's premier medical center. “Rebuilding that sense of ‘We are the President’s Hospital, the flagship of the Military Health System, and where we lead, everyone else follows’ takes time,” Austin said. She emphasized that while facility challenges exist, Walter Reed also tackles broader concerns to enhance patient care and workplace morale. “Given the appropriate latitude at my level to perform—top-down and bottom-up—we have the opportunity to make this a much more efficient place that will make staff excited to come to work,” she said.

U.S. Navy Capt. Juan Rosario, Walter Reed’s chief of staff, provided a personal testament to the hospital’s lifesaving care. “In 2018, my family came here after we were stationed in Italy. My daughter was diagnosed with cancer,” Rosario shared. “The Walter Reed we’re excited to get behind now saved her life.”

He pushed back against the notion that private-sector healthcare is always superior. “The family we have here at Walter Reed and the care that you receive here [show] our commitment,” he said. “We are committed to making sure that the same care my daughter received is the care that every soldier, every Marine, every sailor, and every airman receives every day.”

Ferrara, a former Walter Reed clinician and interventional radiologist, reinforced the need for cohesive medical teams to maintain operational effectiveness. “The health care [system] is an ecosystem, and all things work as a unit,” Ferrara explained. “For a surgeon to wield the scalpel, you need a logistician to buy the scalpel, the patient admin person to check that patient in and generate a wristband. You need a biomed tech to make sure that the instruments are sterile. You need environmental services making sure that the hospital is clean and that infection control measures are met.”

Selnick stressed that patient confidence determines an institution’s success. “Patients will vote with their feet,” he said. “If you are quality, people will come from long distances and wait [to receive your care]. People will flee if there are long wait times and poor care. It’s the whole environment [of care].”

Ferrara emphasized that high-quality healthcare supports military readiness—ensuring service members can focus on their missions without concerns about their families’ well-being. “As we go forward, we want to make sure you have the resources to do what you need to do,” Selnick assured Walter Reed staff.

The town hall forum reaffirmed Walter Reed’s commitment to delivering world-class care while navigating institutional challenges, maintaining mission readiness, and upholding its legacy as the President’s Hospital since 1942.",https://dha.mil/-/media/Project/Images/News-Images/8910784.jpg,N,0.0,2025-03-13 04:50:48.314405

Naval Hospital Guantanamo Bay is a community-based medical treatment facility affiliated with Defense Health Agency.
The hospital provides health care to the Naval Station Guantanamo Bay community that consists of approximately 5,000 military, federal employees, U.S. and foreign national contractors and their families.","GUANTANAMO BAY, Cuba - Tongues – and tails – were wagging at U.S. Naval Hospital Guantanamo Bay as news traveled down the halls one paw at a time; it was official, the American Red Cross Animal Visitation Program kicked off, Jan. 22, 2025.

The inaugural visit began in the command suite boardroom surprising staff members when Chief Nursing Officer, Cmdr. Rebeca Rodriguez, had one last piece of business to share with the commanding officer and executive staff. Rodriguez opened the door and announced the hospital’s first certified canine visitors; Isabel, Knox and Apollo.

“I was completely surprised,” said Naval Hospital Director, Capt. Tammy Servies. “I vaguely remember someone said something about a surprise when I came back from leave, but I had no idea what it was. As a huge fan of dogs, I was very excited.”

A memorandum of agreement between Defense Health Agency and the American Red Cross allows certified animal visitation teams to provide visits to hospitalized patients, staff, and others in military medical treatment facilities.

“Animals have proven to be very beneficial to mental health in many studies,” said Servies. “I’ve been to several other facilities with [certified] dogs and they really help out with stress. I was excited that the Red Cross was offering this same benefit for our facility and jumped on the chance.”

Rodriguez, oversaw the details of bringing the program to the hospital.

“One of the duties I am entrusted with is the advocacy of not just patients, but everyone under the hospital umbrella,” said Rodriguez. “Therapy animals have been proven to assist with PTSD, high blood pressure, and increase morale and genuine levity during and after visits. I advocated for this program as one of the small things that can have a huge impact during someone’s day. Plus, it absolutely helps that our CO is an avid supporter of animals and loves dogs!”

Rodriguez described her own experience when she was visited by one of the dogs at Walter Reed National Military Medical Center. “Seeing the faces of patients and staff light up when Sully walked into a room was one of the best things. I witnessed sheer joy and could see and feel the tensions of the day melt away.”

Isabel, a 10-year-old Labrador retriever mix, is a certified therapy animal who frequently works with the Joint Stress Mitigation and Restoration Team (JSMART) at Joint Task Force Guantanamo. She has several handlers, but her owner and primary handler, Lt. Jyl Bean – a hospital employee assigned to U.S. Navy Medicine Readiness and Training Command Guantanamo Bay – accompanies her during hospital visits.

“Isabel and I went through her therapy training together. She was born for this work with her calm, soothing temperament,” said Bean. “She knows exactly how to bring comfort and connection to those who need it most and having her visit the hospital is just one more way she helps improve the well-being of our sailors.”

The handlers and their dogs toured through the hospital visiting with service members as Rodriguez discussed the areas where the dogs are welcome.

“The dogs are allowed to go into all areas that do not deal with food or sterility,” said Rodriguez. “If there is a request from staff or patients to avoid an area, we honor that request. The hope though is that they will spread their ‘pawsitive’ vibes throughout all areas of the hospital, including our outlying buildings.”

Patients are the focus and priority for the visits, but the healthcare providers benefit as well.

“The animal visitation program supports warfighter readiness by promoting mental health, reducing stress, and enhancing overall well-being,” said Cmdr. Derek Miletich, psychiatrist and behavioral health provider at the hospital.

“Interactions with certified therapy animals have been shown to lower blood pressure, improve mood, and alleviate anxiety—critical factors in maintaining focus and resilience,” Miletich added. “By providing emotional comfort and a sense of normalcy, the program helps service members and their families more optimally manage the challenges of military life, enabling them to remain mission-ready and perform at their best.”

The program can contribute to patient safety by promoting a calmer, more positive healing environment.

“Interacting with therapy animals has been shown to reduce anxiety and stress in patients, which can lower heart rates and blood pressure, supporting better recovery outcomes,” said Miletich. “A more relaxed state can also improve communication between patients and caregivers, creating a clearer understanding of medical instructions and treatment plans. Additionally, therapy animals can help improve emotional well-being, which is closely linked to adherence to treatment and overall patient cooperation, ultimately reducing the risk of complications.”

The animal visitation program has proven successful across several military treatment facilities.

“Walter Reed, Twenty-nine Palms, Camp Lejeune, San Diego, and Portsmouth have all seen success with having dogs aboard the campuses,” said Rodriguez. “Most recently the Navy has had dogs aboard deployed vessels to help combat emotional stressors while underway. 2023 saw the successful implementation of the Navy’s Expanded Operational Stress Control Canine pilot program with dogs aboard the USS Ford and USS Wasp.”

Hospital Corpsman Jacob Rivera Calvo, a recent accession to U.S. Navy Medicine Readiness and Training Command, beamed with a smile when he saw the dogs enter the facility.

“It has been at least two months since I’ve seen a dog,” said Rivera Calvo, who spent the last several months at Hospital Corps “A” School after graduating “Boot Camp” at Recruit Training Command Great Lakes.

“Watching those dogs walk into Patient Centered Medical Home made my entire day,” Rivera Calvo said. “I really enjoyed spending some time petting Apollo and having a few minutes to relax and just smile.”

Regularly scheduled visits will begin March 13, 2025, and feature a rotation of certified dogs on Tuesdays and Thursdays, 10 a.m. - 2 p.m.

Zynex Inc’s recent earnings call presented a mixed sentiment, balancing between notable achievements and significant challenges. While the company celebrated growth in revenue per sales rep and promising trial outcomes for their NiCO pulse oximeter, it faced hurdles such as the Tricare payment suspension and a reported net loss for Q4. The absence of clear guidance for 2025 further contributed to the cautious tone of the call.

Revenue Growth and Diversification

Zynex Inc reported a 4% increase in revenue for 2024, with a notable 16% growth in orders. The company also achieved a 22% increase in revenue per sales representative, averaging $490,000. This growth underscores Zynex’s efforts to diversify and strengthen its revenue streams, despite facing challenges in other areas.

NiCO Pulse Oximeter Development

The development of the NiCO pulse oximeter is progressing well, with positive results from human trials conducted at Duke University and UCSF. Zynex is preparing for an FDA 510(k) submission, which could open doors to a multi-billion dollar market, marking a significant milestone in the company’s product innovation efforts.

Cost Savings

Zynex has implemented cost restructuring initiatives expected to save approximately $35 million annually. This includes a 15% reduction in corporate staff, reflecting the company’s strategic focus on optimizing operational efficiency and maintaining financial health.

Strong Cash Position

The company ended the year with a cash balance of $39.6 million, a 5% increase from Q3, and reported positive cash flows from operations for the year. This strong cash position provides Zynex with a solid foundation to navigate future challenges and invest in growth opportunities.

Tricare Payment Suspension

A significant challenge for Zynex is the temporary suspension of payments by Tricare, affecting 20-25% of its revenue. The resolution timeline remains uncertain, potentially taking up to 12 months, which poses a risk to the company’s financial stability.

Net Loss for Q4 2024

Zynex reported a net loss of $615,000 or $0.02 per share for Q4 2024, a stark contrast to the net income of $1.2 million in Q4 2023. The adjusted EBITDA also saw a significant decrease, highlighting the financial pressures faced by the company.

Decrease in Device Revenue

Device revenue decreased to $14.8 million from $16.3 million in Q4 2023, attributed to a shift in product mix towards lower-priced items. This decline emphasizes the need for Zynex to adapt its product strategy to sustain revenue growth.

Lack of 2025 Guidance

Due to the uncertainties surrounding the Tricare payment suspension, Zynex is unable to provide comprehensive guidance for 2025. This lack of clarity adds to the cautious outlook for the upcoming year.

Forward-Looking Guidance

Zynex’s guidance for the future is marked by both optimism and caution. The company projects $30 million in revenue for Q1 2025, with an anticipated net loss between $9 million and $10 million. Despite these challenges, Zynex remains focused on diversifying its products and revenue streams, with the upcoming FDA submission for the NiCO pulse oximeter being a key strategic priority.

In conclusion, Zynex Inc’s earnings call reflected a blend of optimism and caution. While the company has achieved significant milestones in revenue growth and product development, it faces substantial challenges, particularly with the Tricare payment suspension and financial losses. The lack of clear guidance for 2025 adds to the uncertainty, but Zynex’s strategic focus on diversification and cost savings provides a pathway for potential recovery and growth.

He rejoined without telling me and suddenly I was thrust into an incredibly confusing life that I didn't really want. I knew nothing about the military or their procedures and he preferred to keep me in the dark.

While we were divorcing my ex-husband told myself and the courts that I got to retain my medical coverage. I honestly did not know any better. After the divorce was finalized my lawyer told me that she felt like there was something fishy that I should call Tricare to verify. I did and I was told that I still had Tricare. A few years later I had to call Tricare to get authorization for some medical thing and I asked them about my eligibility and was told yet again I was still eligible. I continued to use Tricare from 2012 to about 2019.

In 2019 we had another custody hearing and I was told that I was no longer eligible for Tricare. Whatever, I had other insurance at that point. Fast forward to today where I get a bill for my OBGYN for almost $500 from an appointment that I went to last year. They told me that Tricare had initially paid for the appointment but then rescinded it because I was not eligible. They accidentally billed Tricare even though I had let them know that I no longer had it and my other insurance was my only. The lady on the phone from the billing department told me that I needed to be careful that Tricare will take back any payments from the entire time they determined you were ineligible. Everything I've looked up now says that I was ineligible as soon as the divorce was finalized and he just never reported to DEERS that we were divorced. I looked all of this up years ago and was not able to find much information and like I said after I called they assured me I was still eligible so I just went with what they said.

This man was a manipulative abuser who made my life a living hell during our marriage and for 15 years after. I feel that he absolutely did this on purpose hoping that I would continue using Tricare and that eventually I would get bogged down with hundreds of thousands of dollars of medical bills. I have serious health conditions, I've seen so many doctors in the time I used Tricare, I've been to multiple specialists over the years. There would be no way to get out from under those bills. I have not heard a single thing else about any other insurance payments getting rescinded. I am wondering if this was just because they billed Tricare after I for sure didn't have it any longer? How likely is Tricare to investigate? I genuinely did not know, how much trouble could I be in? Could he get any trouble? Everything I've read today shows that the service member is the one that is supposed to report everything to DEERS.",,N,-1.0,2025-03-12 20:50:23.947912

Getting routine preventive care can help you stay well and catch problems early.

Be proactive and schedule your preventive health exams this year. With preventive health services, TRICARE has you covered.

So exactly what are preventive services, and what are their benefits?

“Taking care of your health isn’t just about reacting to issues—it’s about staying ahead of them,” said Jeannine Pickrell, director for TRICARE Population Health and Disease Management, at the Defense Health Agency. “Preventive health services include recognized proactive health screenings, counseling, and maintenance to prevent future illness.”

Preventive health services play a key role in your long-term physical and mental health. Read on to learn more about the benefits of preventive health services and how TRICARE covers these services.

Benefits of preventive health services

Preventive health checkups can help avoid health problems before they start. Checkups also help in detecting conditions for which you may be at risk.

According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, preventive health services can help find and diagnose illnesses or diseases by tracking blood pressure, cholesterol, and getting diabetes screenings. This means treatment can start early and is most likely to be effective. Regular preventive checkups have been shown to reduce the risk for serious illness or diseases, like cancer.

Types of preventive health services

When to start health screenings—and how often you have them—will vary. For instance, your gender, age, family history, and other risk factors. For each screening, TRICARE offers guidelines to help you plan. You can also ask your primary health care provider if you’re due for any screenings.

TRICARE covers many types of preventive exams and screenings. Many of them are conducted in a Health Promotion and Disease Prevention exam.

Adults

As you age, it’s important to know when to start preventive care.

Blood pressure screenings

Cancer screenings

Cholesterol testing

Hepatitis B

Immunizations

Physicals

Men should get regular prostate cancer exams. Women should get well-woman exams (includes breast exams, pelvic exams, and Pap tests) and mammograms.

There are special screenings such as a colonoscopy, to determine the health of the colon. CDC guidelines advise a colonoscopy once every 10 years beginning at age 45 for individuals at average risk for colon cancer.

Some types of non-routine diagnostic tests are for patients with signs or symptoms or are at high risk of developing a condition. They may require a referral or pre-authorization from your provider.

Children

Preventive services are key for kids to stay healthy. And, getting your kids in the routine of getting regular checkups is a great habit they’ll take into adulthood. These preventive services include:

Well-child exams (includes developmental and behavioral assessments)

Immunizations

Vision screenings

Preventive care costs

TRICARE makes it easy to get the preventive care you and your family need.

If you see a TRICARE network provider, TRICARE covers all clinical preventive services with no out-of-pocket costs, as described in the TRICARE Costs and Fees Fact Sheet. TRICARE Prime covers one HP&DP exam annually.

If you have TRICARE For Life, you may have a TRICARE cost-share for any preventive service that Medicare or TRICARE doesn’t cover. Visit Medicare’s preventive coverage and screenings page for more information.

Remember, even if you feel well, it’s important to see a doctor regularly to:

“Ideal solutions should be effective for workloads operating across multiple AWS [Amazon Web Services] GovCloud accounts; however, preference will be given to solutions which are agnostic of cloud service providers,” the request for information states.

The RFI also states that industry solutions “at a minimum” should be capable of managing, sustaining and deploying distributions of Kubernetes — the open-source container arrangement platform that automates the deployment and management of containerized software, otherwise known as packages of software that contain all the files needed to run an application independently of other software components in any environment, according to Amazon Web Services.

Further, solutions should be compatible with Platform One’s Big Bang, the DoD’s “trusted” open source DevSecOps platform which can cut the time it takes the department to approve software from years to 90 days utilizing authority to operate, or ATO, procedures, according to Platform One’s website.

“Product vendors should anticipate the need to include integration services within this effort either internally or in partnership with a systems integrator. System integrators without a vendor partnership will be considered if leveraging commercial and/or open-source tools in accordance with all applicable licenses,” the RFI reads.

The system, which provides health care for 9.6 million beneficiaries, including roughly 1.3 million active-duty service members, is struggling with what is known as the ""peacetime effect"" -- making sure that physicians, nurses, medics and corpsmen have needed military training and experience needed to care for troops during conflicts.

It also is dealing with systemic changes initiated in 2017 that have not been fully realized, leaving hospitals short-staffed and patients seeking care elsewhere, witnesses said at a Senate Armed Services Committee hearing on military medical combat readiness.

The Defense Department began reorganizing the military health system nearly a decade ago with a plan to focus the service medical commands on troops and training medical forces for garrison and wartime operations, with the Defense Health Agency managing support services, facilities and health care for family members and other beneficiaries.

Staffing miscalculations, combined with the COVID-19 pandemic and a budget that has not kept up with medical inflation, has left the system unprepared for trauma medicine, retired military trauma surgeons and the first director of the Defense Health Agency said.

Retired Air Force Reserve Col. Jeremy Cannon, who deployed to Iraq and Afghanistan and currently manages a trauma training partnership between Penn Medicine and the U.S. Navy, said just 10% of military surgeons currently are combat ready -- a result of not having enough patients or a variety of cases.

""If we maintain the status quo and enter a pure conflict unprepared, we will condemn thousands of warfighters to preventable death. Without urgent intervention, the [military health system] will continue to slide into medical obsolescence,"" Cannon said.

In 10 years, the budget for military health facilities has declined by nearly 12%, according to committee chairman Sen. Roger Wicker, R-Miss., while medical inflation has risen an average of 5.1% per year.

A concerted effort to rein in health costs in the last decade has greatly affected military physicians' ability to provide care and maintain their skills, said retired Air Force Major Gen. Paul Friedrichs, who served as the Joint Staff Surgeon from 2019 to 2023.

""Health care is not cheap. The mistaken belief that somehow military medicine can be done at a lower cost than in the civilian sector and be ready for conflict is just that,"" Friedrichs said.

In late 2023, then-Deputy Defense Secretary Kathleen Hicks issued a memo calling for the system to bring patients back into military treatment facilities -- family members and retirees who left either by their own choice because they faced challenges getting care at military hospitals and clinics or were forced out with the increased emphasis on active-duty personnel.

The former officers said that, although those patients usually don't present opportunities for practicing trauma skills, care for acute and chronic conditions helps military medicine maintain proficiency.

For example, Friedrichs said, similar skills are needed to reconstruct or remove a bladder that has been damaged by a gunshot wound as are used to operate on a patient with bladder cancer.

""We need our military medics taking care of sick patients. That is how we have done it historically to maintain the proficiency of surgeons or critical care nurses or the medical logistics staff. ... It's not a perfect analog, but it is the best surrogate,"" Friedrichs said.

In addition to bringing back patients and keeping hospitals staffed, the military health system should ramp up efforts to become premier trauma centers in their communities, they added.

Cannon said the system should establish ""five to six"" high-volume military facilities that serve as centers for trauma and burn care and are part of the national emergency preparedness system, open to military and civilian emergencies.

Currently, Brooke Army Medical Center in San Antonio, Texas, is the DoD's only highest-level trauma center, although other hospitals, including Walter Reed National Military Medical Center in Bethesda, Maryland, have received lower-level trauma designations.

Retired Air Force Lt. Gen. Doug Robb, who served as the first head of the Defense Health Agency, and Friedrichs also added that the Defense Department and the Department of Veterans Affairs should increase the level of their partnerships, working together to treat patients in co-located or integrated facilities.

""What I think is really important is that we have to create a capability,"" Robb said.

Friedrichs, who commanded the joint venture DoD-VA hospital in Anchorage, Alaska, said success has been achieved in similar partnerships in Pensacola, Florida, and at Travis Air Force Base in California.

""We want access to critical care patients for our proficiency, and the VA wants access to resources, which is either excess capacity on space or in staff, and so I think that's continued movement forward,"" he said.

The three urged lawmakers not to shutter any pipelines for medical personnel training, given the shortage of providers in the military and civilian sectors, and they pressed for the creation of a Joint Trauma System responsible for spearheading combat casualty care.

Currently, according to Cannon, no single command heads up this important mission.

""In 2017, the Joint Trauma System, or JTS, was codified in law. This committee must now strengthen the statutory language to affirm that JTS owns combat casualty care and to provide this precious resource with both top-down authority and bottom-up support,"" Cannon said.

The recommendations come as the Trump administration has launched an effort to reduce the size of the federal workforce. An estimated 5,400 Defense Department employees were expected to lose their jobs in the first round of cuts, including some from the Defense Health Agency.

Wicker and the committee's ranking Democrat, Sen. Jack Reed of Rhode Island, said they would consider crafting legislation to help improve readiness, and they urged the Defense Department to continue pursuing reforms.

""We must stop scapegoating the Defense Health Agency. The DoD must request adequate resources to ensure that the department's hospitals and clinics are properly staffed and equipped. This is the best way to ensure that the military health system is ready for the potential demands of large-scale combat operations in the future,"" Wicker said.

Reed added that the system must be fixed to ensure that U.S. forces aren't caught without access to care, especially in remote locations where medical responders might not have access to logistics and support.

""The Department of Defense made progress to break through [its] inertia in 2023 when it issued a memorandum with specific directions to stabilize and improve the military health system. ... More work remains to be done, and I hope that the Trump administration will continue the momentum in this area,"" Reed said.

BETHESDA, Md. — Senior Department of Defense (DoD) officials engaged directly with Walter Reed National Military Medical Center staff during a Senior Leaders Forum on March 7, addressing concerns ranging from military medical readiness to workforce reductions and efficiency improvements.

Darin Selnick, Performing the Duties of the Under Secretary of Defense for Personnel and Readiness, and Dr. Stephen Ferrara, Acting Assistant Secretary of Defense for Health Affairs, fielded questions and reinforced Walter Reed's critical role in military healthcare.

Mr. Selnick said it’s important for leaders to conduct site visits and listen to feedback from staff. “Health care equals military readiness,” he said.

Walter Reed’s leadership, including Director U.S. Navy Capt. Melissa C. Austin, underscored the institution’s role as the military health system's premier medical center.

“Rebuilding that sense of ‘We are the President’s Hospital, the flagship of the Military Health System, and where we lead, everyone else follows’ takes time,” Austin said.

She emphasized that while facility challenges exist, Walter Reed also tackles broader concerns to enhance patient care and workplace morale. “Given the appropriate latitude at my level to perform—top-down and bottom-up—we have the opportunity to make this a much more efficient place that will make staff excited to come to work,” she said.

U.S. Navy Capt. Juan Rosario, Walter Reed’s chief of staff, provided a personal testament to the hospital’s lifesaving care.

“In 2018, my family came here after we were stationed in Italy. My daughter was diagnosed with cancer,” Rosario shared. “The Walter Reed we’re excited to get behind now saved her life.”

He pushed back against the notion that private-sector healthcare is always superior. “The family we have here at Walter Reed and the care that you receive here [show] our commitment,” he said. “We are committed to making sure that the same care my daughter received is the care that every soldier, every Marine, every sailor, and every airman receives every day.”

Ferrara, a former Walter Reed clinician and interventional radiologist, reinforced the need for cohesive medical teams to maintain operational effectiveness.

“The health care [system] is an ecosystem, and all things work as a unit,” Ferrara explained. “For a surgeon to wield the scalpel, you need a logistician to buy the scalpel, the patient admin person to check that patient in and generate a wristband. You need a biomed tech to make sure that the instruments are sterile. You need environmental services making sure that the hospital is clean and that infection control measures are met.”

Selnick stressed that patient confidence determines an institution’s success.

“Patients will vote with their feet,” he said. “If you are quality, people will come from long distances and wait [to receive your care]. People will flee if there are long wait times and poor care. It’s the whole environment [of care].”

Ferrara emphasized that high-quality healthcare supports military readiness—ensuring service members can focus on their missions without concerns about their families’ well-being.

“As we go forward, we want to make sure you have the resources to do what you need to do,” Selnick assured Walter Reed staff.

The town hall forum reaffirmed Walter Reed’s commitment to delivering world-class care while navigating institutional challenges, maintaining mission readiness, and upholding its legacy as the President’s Hospital since 1942.",https://d1ldvf68ux039x.cloudfront.net/thumbs/photos/2503/8910784/1000w_q95.jpg,N,0.0,2025-03-12 14:50:31.915688

“DHA is paying Express Scripts billions of taxpayer dollars to manage the TRICARE benefit and negotiate with itself – and DHA isn’t even bothering to check the books.”

Video of Exchange (YouTube)

Washington, D.C. – At a hearing of the Senate Armed Services Committee, U.S. Senator Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) asked Lieutenant General Dr. Douglas J. Robb of the U.S. Air Force about price gouging in the military’s prescription drug system.

Senator Warren slammed the Defense Health Agency for failing to rein in Cigna-owned Express Scripts, the nation’s second largest pharmacy benefit manager (PBM) that manages the prescription drug system for nearly 10 million servicemembers, military retirees, and their family members. Since 2009, the giant PBM has leveraged its $4.3 billion contract to steer patients away from local pharmacies and towards Accredo, a giant pharmacy business that Express Scripts also owns. Now, recent investigations and whistleblower complaints reveal that Express Scripts is failing to report tens of thousands of expensive, specialty drug prescriptions funneled to Accredo, potentially overcharging taxpayers by billions of dollars – just as the company has done in other taxpayer-funded government programs.

Senator Warren called for the Defense Health Agency to audit Express Scripts and for a requirement of that audit to be included in this year’s National Defense Authorization Act.

Lieutenant General Robb agreed that this taxpayer overcharging is “unfair” and said that Express Scripts needs to “follow what is the business policy and what is the contractual law.”

Major General Dr. Paul A. Friedrichs of the U.S. Air Force pointed to the Veterans Health Administration’s prescription drug system, which uses an in-house PBM, as an example of “how to deliver better care and, where possible, do it more efficiently,” and called for collaboration between the agency and Congress to emulate that system for servicemembers and their families in TRICARE.

Transcript: Hearing to Receive Testimony on Stabilizing the Military Health System to Prepare for Large-Scale Combat Operations

Senate Armed Services Committee

March 11, 2025

Senator Elizabeth Warren: Thank you, Mr. Chairman. So, we need a medical healthcare system that works in wartime – but the one we have is failing us in peacetime. And I think we need to do better on this. Fixing TRICARE’s prescription drug benefit is part of that.

Since 2009, TRICARE has outsourced to Express Scripts, a massive pharmacy benefit manager, PBM. The Defense Health Agency, DHA, pays Express Scripts to negotiate with pharmacies, deciding where servicemembers can pick up their prescriptions and what price they’re going to pay.

But Express Scripts also owns Accredo, a massive pharmacy that participates in TRICARE. And DHA has been allowing all kinds of self-dealing between these two entities.

Here’s one: DHA used to require Express Scripts to maintain a network of 50,000 pharmacies. But in 2021, Express Scripts negotiated that down to 35,000. Then it turned around and told thousands of pharmacies that they don’t own to either take money-losing terms or get kicked out of TRICARE.

General Robb, you used to oversee the TRICARE network before this gaming started, but do you have any idea how many pharmacies have left just since 2022?

Lieutenant General Dr. Douglas J. Robb, U.S. Air Force: Senator Warren, I have been out of that business since 2016. So –

Senator Warren: Okay, I just wondered if you’d happened to know how many had left. I’ll take a no.

Lieutenant General Robb: No, ma’am. I do not.

Senator Warren: Well, it’s over 13,000 pharmacies left this network, and most of them are independent pharmacies, community pharmacies. That has forced 400,000 servicemembers and their families to find new pharmacies, and many of them have been pushed to the Express Scripts-owned Accredo.

Even worse, Express Scripts has set up Accredo as the primary off-base pharmacy where military families can fill specialty drug prescriptions – you know, these are the really expensive cancer drugs, rheumatoid arthritis drugs that make up over half of the $8 billion in TRICARE prescription drug spend. So it’s a lot of money here.

And it doesn’t end there. As we speak, Express Scripts is facing a whistleblower lawsuit that alleges the company systematically overfilled TRICARE prescriptions at Accredo, saddling DoD with, “billions-of-dollars in excess dispensing fees and drug resupplies.” And this isn’t a surprise. Express Scripts has been found to massively overfill and overpay for prescriptions at Accredo, which they own, in other government programs.

General Robb, since last year, an audit uncovered that Express Scripts was leveraging its contract with the West Virginia Public Employees system to send inflated payments to Accredo for expensive specialty drugs, in some cases inflating the price by 100-fold more than the cost of dispensing the exact same drugs at a competing pharmacy. I imagine you think this type of taxpayer overcharging is unacceptable, is that fair, General Robb?

Lieutenant General Robb: I would agree with that it would be unfair, yes ma'am.

Senator Warren: DHA is supposed to audit Express Scripts's pharmacy data to make sure the same thing isn’t happening at TRICARE. But DHA said it hadn’t completed an audit because DHA had ""no concerns about data accuracy."" Talk about being asleep at the wheel here.

In just the first quarter of 2023, Express Scripts dispensed 70,000 specialty drug perceptions at Accredo, but the company only reported about 40,000 to DHA. In other words, Accredo failed to report nearly half of the expensive specialty drugs dispensed at its own pharmacy, which were paid for by DHA. They get the money but they don't tell DHA what is going on here.

General Robb, after completing their investigation, GAO sensibly recommended that DHA periodically audit Express Scripts' reported data for accuracy which, by the way, is already required in the contract. So this is telling them basically to follow through on the contract. Do you agree with GAO's recommendation?

Lieutenant General Robb: I would agree that they need to follow what is the business policy and what is the contractual law.

Senator Warren: You know, I just want to say, and I’ll close up here. DHA is paying Express Scripts billions of taxpayer dollars to manage the TRICARE benefit and negotiate with itself. And DHA isn’t even bothering to check the books. I think everyone in the room agrees that Express Scripts ought to pass an audit and that ought to be required in this year's NDAA.

Chair Wicker: Thank you, Senator Warren.

Major General Dr. Paul A. Friedrichs, U.S. Air Force (Ret.): Mr. Chairman, may I add a comment to that? Is there time?

Chair Wicker: You certainly may, yes.

Major General Friedrichs: Thank you very much. I would hold up the Veterans Health Administration's exemplary mail-order program, which has worked for years, as an opportunity – again, going back to the concept of how to deliver better care and, where possible, do it more efficiently. There's a real opportunity for this committee, in partnership with the appropriate VA oversight committees, to direct a comparison of the two systems and then bring back recommendations for the best practices between the two.

Pharmaceuticals are growing in cost, and that is not going to change. But this is an area in which the Veterans Health Administration actually has done this well for years with high patient satisfaction and, more importantly, the patients get the meds they need when they need them. There's a real opportunity to learn from the VA here.

Chair Wicker: Thank you very much.

Randolph, VT, March 12, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Applied Research Associates, Inc. (ARA) and SMU are collaborating to develop microrobots for vitreous hemorrhage mitigation and accelerated recovery.

The project will be led by ARA Senior Research Scientist Louis William Rogowski, PhD, and supported by Min Jun Kim, PhD, of the Robert C. Womack Endowed Chair Professor at SMU's Lyle School of Engineering.

Bleeding inside the eye from vitreous hemorrhage injuries can lead to months of vision impairment and discomfort, reducing the combat readiness of U.S. armed forces. Researchers will build small-scale microrobots using nanotechnology that can go inside the human eye and break down red blood cells through targeted drug delivery.

""The idea is that this microrobotics approach would be less invasive than current treatment methods and accelerate the recovery of patients,” Rogowski said. ""This is the first initial effort to make this idea a reality.”

ARA's Randolph, VT location will host the laboratory facilities needed to carry out the experiments in conjunction with SMU's facilities in Dallas, TX. By the end of the effort, the team will produce innovative microrobots, advanced control systems, and quantitative data showing the effectiveness of the treatment strategy.

Several SMU graduate students will participate in the research in support of their studies and consultants from the University of Colorado Anschutz Medical Campus will also lend their expertise to ensure the effort's success.

ARA and its partners are leveraging microrobotics for numerous applications including targeted drug delivery, minimally invasive surgery, environmental remediation, encryption, and defense applications. ARA is proud to partner with medical, academic, and military communities to develop leading-edge health solutions.

The project is sponsored by the Medical Technology Enterprise Consortium (MTEC) and the Defense Health Agency. This effort is fully sponsored by the Government under Other Transaction Number HT9425-25-9-0004.

Read on to learn more about the benefits of preventive health services and how TRICARE covers these services.
Benefits of preventive health services Preventive health checkups can help avoid health problems before they start.
Types of preventive health services When to start health screenings—and how often you have them—will vary.","MARCH 12, 2025 – Your health is about more than just sick visits and medications—it’s also about making choices that keep you feeling your best. Getting routine preventive care can help you stay well and catch problems early.

Be proactive and schedule your preventive health exams this year. With preventive health services, TRICARE has you covered.

So exactly what are preventive services, and what are their benefits?

“Taking care of your health isn’t just about reacting to issues—it’s about staying ahead of them,” said Jeannine Pickrell, director for TRICARE Population Health and Disease Management, at the Defense Health Agency. “Preventive health services include recognized proactive health screenings, counseling, and maintenance to prevent future illness.”

Preventive health services play a key role in your long-term physical and mental health. Read on to learn more about the benefits of preventive health services and how TRICARE covers these services.

Benefits of preventive health services

Preventive health checkups can help avoid health problems before they start. Checkups also help in detecting conditions for which you may be at risk.

According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, preventive health services can help find and diagnose illnesses or diseases by tracking blood pressure, cholesterol, and getting diabetes screenings. This means treatment can start early and is most likely to be effective. Regular preventive checkups have been shown to reduce the risk for serious illness or diseases, like cancer.

Types of preventive health services

When to start health screenings—and how often you have them—will vary. For instance, your gender, age, family history, and other risk factors. For each screening, TRICARE offers guidelines to help you plan. You can also ask your primary health care provider if you’re due for any screenings.

TRICARE covers many types of preventive exams and screenings. Many of them are conducted in a Health Promotion and Disease Prevention exam.

Adults

As you age, it’s important to know when to start preventive care:

Blood pressure screenings

Cancer screenings

Cholesterol testing

Hepatitis B

Immunizations

Physicals

Men should get regular prostate cancer exams. Women should get well-woman exams (includes breast exams, pelvic exams, and Pap tests) and mammograms.

There are special screenings such as a colonoscopy, to determine the health of the colon. CDC guidelines advise a colonoscopy once every 10 years beginning at age 45 for individuals at average risk for colon cancer.

Some types of non-routine diagnostic tests are for patients with signs or symptoms or are at high risk of developing a condition. They may require a referral or pre-authorization from your provider.

Children

Preventive services are key for kids to stay healthy. And, getting your kids in the routine of getting regular checkups is a great habit they’ll take into adulthood. These preventive services include:

Well-child exams (includes developmental and behavioral assessments)

Immunizations

Vision screenings

Preventive care costs

TRICARE makes it easy to get the preventive care you and your family need.

If you see a TRICARE network provider, TRICARE covers all clinical preventive services with no out-of-pocket costs, as described in the TRICARE Costs and Fees Fact Sheet. TRICARE Prime covers one HP&DP exam annually.

If you have TRICARE For Life, you may have a TRICARE cost-share for any preventive service that Medicare or TRICARE doesn’t cover. Visit Medicare’s preventive coverage and screenings page for more information.

Remember, even if you feel well, it’s important to see a doctor regularly to:

Maintain good health

Help avoid problems in the future

Detect a condition before it worsens

I delayed enrolling in Part B for 5 years after I turned 70 and retired with a January 1 effective date for my Medicare Supplement Plan G and Part D prescription drug plan.

Now my Medicare stress has started, because I have received a notice from CMS saying they do not have record of me having prescription drug coverage that “met Medicare’s minimum standards” from March 1, 2019, when I turned 65 to January 1, 2025, when I retired, and I may receive a Part D late enrollment penalty.

I thought applying for Part B with that form from my employer attached kept me from a Part D penalty. Can you please advise me what to do? I want to be sure that I do not make a mistake. Thank you, Toni.– Zach, Lake Jackson, TX.

Hi Zach: Many Americans who retire after 65, leaving employer group health plans, apply for Medicare benefits and discover that they now may need to prove they had “creditable drug coverage” for a Medicare Part D prescription drug plan.

Zach, enrolling in Medicare Part B properly does not prove that your employer’s group prescription drug plan was creditable. The Medicare & You handbook states:

“Creditable prescription drug coverage could include drug coverage from a current or former employer or union, TRICARE, Indian Health Service, the Department of Veterans Affairs, or individual health insurance coverage. Your plan must tell you each year if your non-Medicare drug coverage is creditable coverage.” … Keep records showing when you had other creditable prescription drug coverage and tell your plan when they ask about it. If you don’t tell your plan about your previous creditable prescription drug coverage, you may have to pay a penalty for as long as you have Medicare drug coverage.

The paragraphs above do not advise what creditable coverage is. To explore for more details on “creditable prescription drug coverage” visit www.medicare.gov or email info@tonisays.com with your Medicare questions.

Creditable drug coverage should “meet or exceed” Medicare’s Part D plan minimum. The minimum deductible for 2025, as an example, should at least be $590 or less (this amount changes every year) with a maximum out-of-pocket. The benefit amount should be unlimited, so if your plan has a coverage limit or cap, it is not creditable. Unlimited prescription drug coverage is the key.

Medicare does not regard discount prescription drug programs from Walmart, Kroger, GoodRx, Amazon pharmacy or your local pharmacy that offer low-cost generics as “creditable coverage.” If you believe these plans can keep you from the Late Enrollment Penalty (LEP), I need to tell you that you’re WRONG!! According to CMS (Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services), these types of prescription drug programs are not creditable.

For Veterans using the VA for prescriptions, I have good news for you – Medicare does consider the VA pharmacy to be creditable coverage.

Medicare can impose the Late Enrollment Penalty (LEP) because:

-Your company prescription drug benefits are not considered creditable as Medicare declares.

-You fail to call and confirm that your company prescription drug benefits were creditable, if requested via correspondence from your Part D plan.

-You had no creditable coverage and never enrolled in Medicare Part D when you were first eligible.

If you wait longer than 63 days without creditable prescription drug coverage when leaving company benefits and are older than 65 years and 90 days old, you may be assessed a LEP which is 1 percent for each month back to the month your Part A began, not from when your Part B begins. (Chapter 5 of my Medicare Survival Guide Advanced edition explains Medicare Part D and how to avoid Part D penalties).

Zach, you need to find the record from your previous (employer) plan showing that your prescription drug coverage was “creditable” and submit it when your new Part D plan.",https://www.canyon-news.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/Toni-King.jpg,N,0.0,2025-03-12 13:50:32.477547

Operator

Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the Zynex fourth-quarter 2024 earnings conference call. (Operator Instructions) As a reminder, this conference is being recorded.

I would now like to turn the conference over to Brian Prenoveau, Investor Relations for Zynex.

Brian Prenoveau

Thank you, operator, and good afternoon, everyone. Earlier today, Zynex released financial results for the fourth quarter and year ended December 31, 2024. A copy of the press release is available on the company's website.

Joining me today on the call are Thomas Sandgaard, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer; Dan Moorhead, Chief Financial Officer; Anna Lucsok, Chief Operating Officer; and Donald Gregg, President of Zynex Monitoring Solutions.

Before we begin, I'd like to remind you that during this conference call, the company will make projections and forward-looking statements regarding future events. We encourage you to review the company's past and future filings with the SEC including, without limitation, the company's 2024 Form 10-K and subsequent Form 10-Qs, which identify the specific factors that may cause actual results or events to differ materially from those described in these forward-looking statements.

These factors may include, without limitation, statements regarding product development, product potential, the regulatory environment, sales and marketing strategies, capital resources or operating performance.

With that, I'll now turn the call over to Thomas.

Thomas Sandgaard

Thanks, Brian, and good afternoon, everyone. Thank you for joining us today for the fourth-quarter and full-year 2024 earnings call. 2024 was a successful year for Zynex as we continue to grow revenue and drive profitability.

We have made strides in diversifying our revenue streams with the addition of several new products, some internally developed and some manufactured and added private label products, primarily in the areas of pricing, cold and compression products, all a perfect fit for our sales force's call points in pain and rehab.

We've also expanded the focus of our sales force to additional new prescribers of pain and rehab products such as national change of workers' comp and the VA. In a moment, Don Gregg will provide you with an update for our patient monitoring business and the FDA submission of our pulse oximeter.

In late 2024, we received positive test results on our NiCO pulse oximiter in multiple trials done at Duke University and at the University of California and San Francisco. Human trial completion is an essential step prior to our 510(k) submission to the FDA.

The data from the trials have been excellent in showing how much lower buyers the current LED-based compared to how the current LED-based oximeters exhibit, especially for skin with darker pigmentation. The old LED technology leads to inaccurate or inconsistent readings during clinical -- or critical times for a patient, which has been widely criticized in the media and politically.

We believe that our laser-based system is a superior technology and has the opportunity to meaningfully impact patient outcomes. I would like Don Gregg to provide more details on the status momentarily.

We were recently notified by TRICARE that they were temporarily suspending payments to Zynex related to a review of prior claims. We have a meeting with them here in early April to get it all sorted out, but cannot at this point, provide an estimate on when it will all be resolved. Anna will provide more details during her discussion of operations.

Given that TRICARE is a substantial source of reimbursement revenue, we currently have limited visibility in our revenue projections for 2025. And we have taken the most conservative approach to not include revenue in the later part of 2024, where some of those builds were submitted to TRICARE yet not paid. And in this current quarter forecast and therefore the corresponding lower revenue numbers.

As part of a normal prudent cost containment measure due to the possibility of a significant decrease in revenue short term, while we accelerate sales to other sales channels, we continue to make adjustments to the corporate and sales cost structure to ensure we have optimized our structure and expense profile and are set to continue our long-term growth and profitability. And again, Anna will cover this in more detail.

We remain very optimistic about the future of Zynex, the improvement we have made in analytics and operations over the past many years, we show significant benefits in the long term. As we continue to diversify the product mix and revenue stream, we believe we can actually better capture the $800 million of identified sales opportunities within our 800 designated sales territories. In the patient monitoring business, we had just before FDA submission and once cleared, that should generate revenue in a very well-established multibillion-dollar sales segment.

Over the past 29 years since inception, our growth has certainly not been in a straight line as long-term shareholders would certainly acknowledge. And the key for us is to keep focused on the long vision of growth and diversification and stay firm regardless of short-term disruptions. We trust that shareholders are on board with this strategy.

Our recent challenges in 2024 were not only introducing new products that so far have collected less than expected. However, we see clear signs of improvement here in early 2025. Our sales force and staff has been restructured and we have made changes to sales management.

These improvements are already beginning to take effect and puts us in a good position to deal with the temporary suspension -- payment suspension from TRICARE, while we focus on growing in other areas. Fortunately, we are in an industry where our potential call points for our sales force is nearly endless.

We are still confident that our noninvasive approach with at-home pain management devices have real growth opportunities to provide non-opioid relief to patients. We remain focused on ramping our hospital monitoring division, which represents a large and growing market opportunity with a better mass trap than our competitors in the pulse oximeter market.

I'll now turn the call over to Anna Lucsok to provide a more detailed update on the operations and the status with TRICARE. Anna?

Anna Lucsok

Thank you, Thomas. As Thomas mentioned, we were notified by TRICARE of a temporary suspension of payments if they complete their review. From a reimbursement perspective, TRICARE is one of our largest insurers. We're currently working through the reinstatement process and have a meeting with Defense Health Agency to present our appeal in early April, but worst case, it could take as long as 12 months to complete.

TRICARE represents between 20% to 25% of our revenue. So this is a significant reduction in revenue if the suspension were to be upheld. I think it is important to note a few things relative to this news. We completed an audit with TRICARE as recently as 2022.

In this audit, we made all of the necessary adjustments to billing practices that were outlined and we haven't heard anything further since that time. We have demonstrated that we fully comply with those adjustments and have a good cost for eventually continued business as usual with TRICARE.

During this temporary suspension, we remain in network with TRICARE and are expected to continue processing new and existing claims for treatment for TRICARE patients. In fact, TRICARE has said that they [ will incur ] and new patients to continue receiving care through this process per hour contract. If or when the reimbursement begin again, TRICARE would be responsible for paying all of the claims that have been processed during the temporary hold, which would show significantly increased revenue once received.

Moving on to operations. We're also restructuring our organization and staff levels, which will decrease overall staff by 15% and primarily affects employees in our corporate office along with other expense reductions made during the second half of 2024 and Q1 2025, will result in annual savings of approximately $35 million. This is a normal and good business practice that all companies constantly undergo.

In 2024, trimmed the sales force to ensure we have the right reps in place to put us in the best position moving forward. As of December 31, we had a sales force of approximately 330 people as compared to the beginning of 2024, where we had approximately 475 people.

Progress takes time, but we have seen positive trends. Revenue increased 4% in 2024 and order growth was 16% in the year. The total number of reps was down with the revenue per rep increased 22% to 490,000 on average in 2024.

I'll now turn the call over to Don Gregg to provide a more detailed update on the patient monitoring business. Don?

Donald Gregg

Thank you, Anna. I want to provide an update on the progress of our NiCO pulse oximeter. Although our FDA submission has been delayed into 2025, we are closing on major milestones to commercialize the NiCO pulse oximeter. NiCO verification human trials completed in fourth quarter of 2024 at Duke University, with positive results as planned.

Zynex's NiCO pulse oximeter utilizes precise laser technology to measure blood oxygenation levels directly as opposed to current LED pulse oximeter products, which only estimate oxygenation levels. LED pulse oximeters have been shown to mismeasure oxygen levels in several populations most prominently in individuals with darker skin pigmentation.

We presented a poster of our study from the University of California, San Francisco Hypoxia lab at Anesthesiology 2024 in the fourth quarter. Four NiCO pulse oximeters and two different commercially available LED-based pulse oximeters were used on each participant.

Conclusions from the study showed the NiCO pulse oximeter did not demonstrate a bias for dark pigmented participants compared to lightly segmented participants. By comparison, conventional LED-based pulse oximeters in the present study read falsely higher on darkly pigmented participants, specifically at lower oxygen saturation levels.

There have been published studies starting in the 1980s that detail how these inaccuracies were associated with disparities in care. Completed human trials were one of the last major milestones to complete prior to the FDA 510(k) submission. In late 2024 and into 2025, NiCOs have been undergoing third-party regulatory ISO testing for compliance to safety and electrical standards.

At this point, we anticipate FDA submission in the next 30 to 60 days following that completion based on historical submissions, approval takes approximately 6 months, which would mean a potential fourth quarter 2025 clearance barring any uncertainty of FDA review resources.

Also, in December of 2024, we announced our membership in the open oximetry project, a nonprofit oximetry partnership of research organizations and industry is created to improve the safety and precision of pulse oximeters in all populations.

Zynex is pushing to be a key industry partner to all clinicians and show how the NiCO pulse oximeter technology inherently solves the current market challenges, especially skin pigmentation bias while bringing new precision medicine forward in the field of pulse oximetry.

In summary, we've achieved major milestones in Q4 of 2024, and on NiCO commercial development, clinical verification, and we are very close to FDA 510(k) submission. Patient monitoring is a multibillion-dollar market that we believe we can enter with a superior product that can meaningfully improve care to a broad range of patients when they need it most.

I will now turn the call over to Dan Moorhead, Chief Financial Officer, for a more in-depth look at the quarter's financial performance.

Daniel Moorhead

Thanks, Don. Please refer to our press release issued earlier today for a summary of our financial results for the fourth quarter and year ended December 31, 2024.

Net revenue was $46 million compared to $47.3 million in the fourth quarter of 2023. Device revenue was $14.8 million compared to $16.3 million in the fourth quarter of last year. Supplies revenue was $31.2 million, up from $31 million in the fourth quarter of last year. Device revenue was lower during the quarter due to some product mix shift to lower-priced products such as braces and other products that have lower price points than NexWave devices.

Gross profit in the fourth quarter was $36 million or 78% of revenue as compared to $37 million, also 78% of revenue in 2023. Sales and marketing expenses were $19.3 million in the fourth quarter of 2024 compared to $21.7 million in the same period in 2023. The primary contributor to the decrease in sales and marketing expenses was our headcount reduction of roughly 140 sales team members.

G&A expenses were $17.3 million in the fourth quarter of compared to $13 million last year, largely due to ZMS increased expenses and professional fees. Net loss was $615,000 or $0.02 per share in the fourth quarter of 2024 compared to net income of $1.2 million or $0.04 per share in Q4 of '23.

Adjusted EBITDA for the three months ended December 31, 2024, was $584,000 as compared to $9.9 million in the quarter ended December 31, 2023. Cash flows from operations were $2.4 million in Q4 and $12.7 million for the full year. The cash flow in the quarter and year increased our cash on the balance sheet to $39.6 million up 5% from Q3's balance of $37.6 million. Working capital was $58.3 million as of December 31.

With that, I'll now turn the call back over to Thomas.

Thomas Sandgaard

Yeah. Thank you, Dan. The beginning of 2025 was certainly not as smooth as we had hoped, but we are optimistic about the long-term prospects of the company and the opportunities we have going forward. That still has not changed. Because of the uncertainties surrounding payments here short term for TRICARE, we will not be providing full 2025 annual guidance yet, given the lack of visibility surrounding the temporary payment suspension.

We are obviously still in network with TRICARE and continue to accept new prescriptions for the instructions. When we learn more information throughout the year, we'll be better able to communicate expectations and update everyone.

At this stage, we anticipate the first quarter this year revenue of approximately $30 million. We will likely have a net loss in the first quarter ranging between $9 million and $10 million as a result of not all restructuring having taken effect yet. Throughout this year, we will look to make adjustments to the cost structures as needed.

Fundamentally, with or without TRICARE as payer, we still have a rock solid business that will continue to grow towards revenues of $800 million-plus in the pain management division. Our diversification into the patient monitoring area is set to start adding revenue late this year and next year, pending FDA clearance.

We're incredibly proud of the growth that we have consistently demonstrated over the past several years. Just 10 years ago, our revenues were nearly 20 times lower than now. And in the meantime, we've been able to buy back over $80 million worth of stock in the open market. And we had a cash balance of $40 million at the end of 2024. Well, 10 years ago, we were scraping the bottom while bank account daily to pay our bills.

Looking forward, we believe we have additional customers and revenue streams that can drive further growth. The business we have created and the profitability we are able to generate allows us to have a high degree of flexibility to allocate capital in several ways and deal with temporary difficult situations like this. We have shown the ability to adjust to market customer and reimbursement changes and continue to invest in our business and return cash to shareholders.

With that, operator, please open the call up for questions.

Question and Answer Session

Operator

(Operator Instructions) Jeffrey Cohen, Ladenburg.

Jeffrey Cohen

Well, hi. Thanks for taking our questions. Just a couple from our end. So when you talk about the stock reductions of 15%-ish. Could you give us a sense of what was accomplished in the fourth quarter? And then also give us a sense of how that will affect your two OpEx lines, both the sales line and the G&A line?

Daniel Moorhead

Yeah. I would say the -- we probably did -- if you're looking at $30 million-plus in annual savings, I would say a little less than half of it was done during 2024. But you wouldn't see all of it because, obviously, you're looking at run rates and those types of things. So they were -- a lot of those were implemented in the second half. And then the remaining pieces were done in Q1 with some of that coming late in Q1.

So as -- if you're looking at sales expenses and those types of things, as far as run rate Q4 sales, we just posted $19.3 million. I think that number is definitely coming down, and that has been coming down for the past few quarters, as you know.

So it's probably down million to $2 million on the run rate going forward. And then G&A, you're going to see about the same thing down a couple of million dollars a quarter based on what we did in Q4. And those will actually continue to come down in Q2 a little bit as well. Like I said, a lot of those changes were put in at the end or middle to end of Q1.

Jeffrey Cohen

Yeah. So I guess the 30% on an annual basis for 2025, does it hit both the sales and marketing as well as the G&A, the same percentage? Or is it going to be more heavily weighted on the sales and marketing line?

Daniel Moorhead

No, it'd be more on the G&A because the G&A is a smaller number, too. So it's going to be a bigger number out of these smaller numbers. Sales was already decreasing based on the trimming that Anna talked about and those types of things. So I think as a percentage, it's going to be more on the G&A line, but both are going to be decreasing by like I said, run rate, you're looking at close to $2 million compared to what we did in Q4.

Jeffrey Cohen

Got it. Okay. Secondly, maybe for Thomas or for Don. Could you hypothesize with us a little bit about [NiCOx] and the commercial path to market that you're anticipating? Are you hypothesizing going direct yourselves with a commercial organization or your hypothesizing partners or different setups for different channels?

Donald Gregg

So this is Don. We have a strategy that actually leverages all three of those. As you look at penetrating the market as we would get clearance in potentially in 2026 certainly would be the year of ramp for that. We have been in discussions with potential partners, not just distribution partners but partners that would potentially take the device and put it in their sales bag. We have had discussions through what it would look like as part of a direct sales force, where we would start with particular hospitals and IDNs.

And then third of all, we have looked at an indirect sales force of potential 1099s of organizations that sell both capital and disposable equipment in this. And so we're poised to be ready to pull the trigger when we have clearance and covered the entire plan with Thomas and our executive leaders.

Jeffrey Cohen

Okay, perfect. That does it for us. Thanks for taking our questions.

Operator

Shagun Singh, RBC.

Avi Dahan

Hey. Good afternoon. This is Avi on for Shagun. I have a few questions. First, what was the nature of the 2022 audit by TRICARE related to billing practices? And I guess, why didn't you have any visibility to TRICARE ahead of time before this happened?

Anna Lucsok

So the nature of the audit was a routine post-payment audit. It's very common from most insurance companies and the type of adjustments that were suggested during the audit were also fairly standard. So nothing major was identified or adjusted.

Avi Dahan

Okay. Could you -- Okay. I guess that's helpful. Why don't you have -- you only gave Q1 sales guidance not 2025, obviously, but why don't you have the visibility into sales? You have still 75% of your business or so that is being reimbursed? Could there be a domino effect? What conversations are you having with other payers?

Thomas Sandgaard

No, there's really no connection here. This is totally isolated. We do, obviously, internally have some numbers that are -- if TRICARE end up never paying us anything or if they don't start picking up payment until the end of the year, we're pretty confident that at some point throughout the year, we'll eventually get through this conversation with them and basically prove that, hey, we did everything you asked for, what's your problem. It's been very unclear exactly what it is they're looking for.

So -- and because TRICARE is such a big part of our revenue, we obviously the difference in the guidance we will give is many tens of millions dollars, if not more than $50 million, right? So therefore, we'd like to have a little more clarity into our dialogue with try before we get to revenue guidance. What we are doing is to make sure in a worst-case scenario, let's keep doing what we always should be doing, make sure we trim expenses and restructure the organization to be able to handle even worse case scenarios.

Avi Dahan

Okay. Great. And the last question is, what's your plan like to present at this April meeting with TRICARE? Have they told you any details on what they -- are they requesting anything? Or do you have, I guess, data to show them to whatever to help them figure it out whatever it is that they exactly need from you?

Anna Lucsok

Yeah. They gave us some vague guidance on what they're looking for. It's still very unclear what exactly their problem is. But we have lots of data to present to them on -- specifically regarding policies that we're following. We will be referring back to the 2022 audit and the findings of that audit and adjustments.

There were some directions we received during the audit that we'll be highlighting in that presentation. So that's mainly going to be our focus.

Avi Dahan

Thank you.

Operator

Yi Chen, H.C. Wainwright.

Yi Chen

Thank you for taking my question. Could you comment on what specific factors that triggered TRICARE to start reviewing your product claims? And is it a typical practice that's going to review process, payers will temporarily suspend payments?

Anna Lucsok

We're unclear on specific triggers at this point because they haven't communicated clearly what the issue is. As far as these type of reviews, I mean, post-payment reviews among payers are very common. We undergo multiple audits or post-payment reviews from several different payers on a monthly basis. Payment suspension is somewhat common. It's not the usual practice, but it happens with other payers as well.

Yi Chen

So are you worried that other players could potentially follow TRICARE and start reviewing claims and suspend payments to you?

Thomas Sandgaard

We don't see any connection. I mean it's across the board. We deal with 3,000 insurance companies every -- all the time. And these things happen with small insurance companies, large insurance carriers. TRICARE is a big one.

obviously. So therefore, we have taken this very conservative approach. But these guys all operate very independently. There's really no connection. And this is a government payer.

It's not in the private sector. So that's already there, but a big disconnect.

Yi Chen

And just trying to clarify, did you mention that this kind of process could potentially tick up to 12 months to resolve, the letter?

Anna Lucsok

Yeah. So the letter from Defense Health Agency stated, this is a temporary payment suspension and it could be up to 12 months. but we are given an opportunity to present an appeal within 30 days, which we have a meeting scheduled in the beginning of April, and we'll know more after that meeting.

Thomas Sandgaard

And yet they have been nerve to demand that we still treat and send supplies to existing patients and keep accepting new patients and treat them 100% like we always have, except they don't send us payment in the meantime. Not very nice, but that's the reality, at least now.

Yi Chen

Does claims made to TRICARE cover a specific territories in the country or it's across the country?

Anna Lucsok

They're national. There across the country.

Thomas Sandgaard

Yeah. Actually, one of their letters had an interesting statement in It that we were one of their very valued providers and they really appreciate working with us. Yeah. Obviously, we provide opioid-free pain management to TRICARE patients. Obviously, it's a pretty big deal for what we do for all those patients.

Yi Chen

Great. Thank you for taking my question.

Operator

There are no further questions at this time. I'd like to turn the call over to Thomas Sandgaard for closing remarks. Sir, please go ahead.

Thomas Sandgaard

Yeah. Thank you for joining us today. Although disappointing, we still overall, long term, pleased with our performance and where things are headed. And last year, obviously, we ended up with a decent financial result and the consistent growth that our team is delivering.

We look forward to leveraging our momentum and the changes we are making to the organization and the direction of our sales force throughout 2025, and we look forward to speaking to you at upcoming investor events.

We appreciate your time and interest in Zynex. Have a great day.

Wainwright adjusted its outlook on Zynex Inc. (NASDAQ: ), decreasing the 12-month price target from $17.00 to $15.00, while retaining a Buy rating on the stock. The decision came after Zynex reported its fourth-quarter and full-year financial results for 2024. According to InvestingPro data, the company currently trades at $7.00, near its 52-week low of $6.91, suggesting potential value opportunity for investors. The company experienced a year-over-year (YoY) decline of 3% in total revenue for the fourth quarter, totaling $46.0 million, which fell short of the expected $53.7 million.

The revenue shortfall was attributed to delayed payments from a payor, with Tricare having temporarily suspended payments for a review of prior claims. Tricare’s suspension is significant as it accounts for about 20-25% of Zynex’s annual revenue. The company reported a net loss of $0.6 million, or ($0.02) per share, which is below the projected income of $2.8 million.

Despite the fourth-quarter setback, Zynex’s full-year 2024 results showed a 4.4% YoY growth in total revenue, reaching $192.4 million. The company also reported a net income of $3.0 million, or $0.09 per share. Notably, Zynex saw a 16% increase in orders for the year. InvestingPro subscribers can access detailed analysis of Zynex’s financial health, including 10+ additional ProTips and comprehensive valuation metrics in the Pro Research Report, helping investors make more informed decisions during this transitional period.

In response to the current challenges, Zynex is reducing its overall staff by 15%, which is expected to save about $35 million annually. The company continues to expand payor coverage, which could help mitigate some of the near-term sales impact. Zynex’s management anticipates a minimum revenue of $30 million and a diluted EPS of ($0.30) or better for the first quarter of 2025.

Zynex is scheduled to meet with Tricare in April, with hopes that payments will be reinstated. However, the timeline for resolving this issue remains uncertain. H.C. Wainwright believes that although the growth rate of orders may slow down, it will continue to increase in upcoming quarters. Consequently, the firm’s estimated market value has been revised to $472 million, or approximately $15 per share, leading to the updated price target.

In other recent news, Zynex Inc. reported a net loss for the fourth quarter of 2024, with earnings per share (EPS) of -$0.02, missing analysts’ expectations of $0.10. The company’s revenue was $45.98 million, falling short of the anticipated $53.3 million, signaling challenges in meeting market expectations. Additionally, Zynex disclosed a slower-than-usual receipt of payments from certain payers, including a temporary suspension of payments by Tricare, which accounts for 20-25% of the company’s sales. This development has led the company to refrain from issuing guidance for 2025 and plan a 15% workforce reduction to align costs with anticipated revenue levels.

RBC Capital Markets downgraded Zynex’s stock from Outperform to Sector Perform, reducing its price target from $11.00 to $5.50, citing operational concerns highlighted during the earnings call. The firm expressed worries about the potential for further complications with other payers following the issues with Tricare. Despite these challenges, Zynex maintains a strong gross profit margin of 78% and is focusing on diversifying into patient monitoring technologies, with anticipated revenue from this segment expected in late 2025 or 2026 pending FDA clearance.

Zynex’s cash on the balance sheet increased by 5% from the previous quarter to $39.6 million, providing some financial cushion amid the current uncertainties. The company is actively working with Tricare to resolve the payment suspension, with a meeting scheduled for April to address the issue. Investors and analysts will be closely monitoring Zynex’s ability to manage its payer relationships and adjust its cost structure as it navigates these operational headwinds.

My Military Health’s Scheduled Virtual Visits, a new DHA service, integrates virtual, automated, and digital multi-specialty healthcare into a patient's overall care journey. This platform increases access to care for Airmen that is safe, convenient, and confidential.

All trained Mental Health technicians can operate this new platform across Cannon AFB. This virtual option enables Air Commandos to continue their mental health care regardless of their physical location, ensuring continuity of care for Air Commandos even when deployed, on leave, or at temporary duty locations leading to fewer cancellations.

“It provides Airmen more flexibility with their care,” said the mental health flight commander at the 27th SODMG. “Let’s say you had an appointment scheduled for today and things are just not going well, instead of still trying to drag yourself into the building, or cancelling, you can switch your appointment to virtual seamlessly.""

This new system fully integrates with MHS Genesis, supporting providers by delivering increased access to a comprehensive view of their patients care history.

Implementing this new system comes at a time when virtual healthcare is proving increasingly vital, particularly in the realm of accessibility to mental health care. Notably, Cannon AFB experienced a 63% increase in virtual mental health appointments from 2023 to 2024.

This surge in demand highlights the growing acceptance and use of telehealth as a crucial resource for Airmen seeking mental health support.

While walk-ins and scheduled in-person visits with mental health providers remain available, the virtual option helps eliminate potential stigmas associated with seeking help. Virtual mental health care also provides more privacy, resulting in more Airmen seeking the help they need.

“The negative stigma or the fear of being seen walking to mental health has become a barrier to care for military members of all ranks.” said a 27th SOMDG Group Practice Manager. “Thankfully, increases in access to virtual care are drastically helping us to combat that stigma.”

The convenience and confidentiality offered by telehealth platforms like “My Military Health’s Scheduled Virtual Visits” empower Airmen to prioritize their mental wellbeing.

For dependents and DoD civilian employees, access to virtual mental health care services, including psychiatry, is available through the Telemynd platform.

The 27th SOMDG is confident the transition to My Military Health’s Scheduled Virtual Visit system will enhance healthcare delivery and improve the overall well-being of Air Commandos at Cannon.

Analysts from firms such as Ladenburg and RBC have shown interest in Zynex’s strategies to address these issues, particularly the TRICARE payment suspension.","On Wednesday, shares of Zynex Inc. (NASDAQ: ), currently trading near its 52-week low of $6.91, may face headwinds as RBC Capital Markets downgraded the medical technology company’s stock from Outperform to Sector Perform. The firm also slashed its price target to $5.50 from the previous $11.00. According to InvestingPro data, three analysts have recently revised their earnings estimates downward for the upcoming period. This decision comes after Zynex provided a less-than-optimistic update during its fourth-quarter earnings call, which raised concerns about the company’s visibility into its operations and future business performance.

Zynex disclosed a slower-than-usual receipt of payments from certain payers during the fourth quarter. Additionally, the company received a notification from Tricare, its largest payer, which accounts for 20-25% of Zynex’s sales exposure, about a temporary suspension of payments to review previous claims. Despite these challenges, the company maintains a strong financial position with a current ratio of 3.94 and an impressive gross margin of 79.7%. This news is particularly troubling for the company as it could significantly impact revenue streams.

In response to the uncertainties, Zynex has decided not to issue guidance for 2025. Furthermore, the company is planning to reduce its workforce by approximately 15% in an effort to align its cost base with the anticipated new revenue levels. These measures indicate that Zynex is entering a period of restructuring to stabilize its business.

The revised price target from RBC Capital reflects the potential risks associated with the loss of its largest payer. The analysts at RBC Capital expressed concerns about the possibility of a domino effect, where the issues with Tricare might lead to further complications with other payers, potentially exacerbating the company’s financial challenges.

Investors are likely to keep a close eye on Zynex’s next moves as it navigates through these operational headwinds. The company’s ability to manage its payer relationships and adjust its cost structure will be critical in determining its financial health and stock performance going forward. Notably, InvestingPro’s Fair Value analysis suggests the stock may be undervalued at current levels, despite the operational challenges.

In other recent news, Zynex Inc. reported a net loss for the fourth quarter of 2024, missing analysts’ expectations. The company recorded an earnings per share (EPS) of -$0.02, falling short of the projected $0.10, with revenue reported at $45.98 million, below the expected $53.3 million. This performance marks a decline in net revenue compared to the same quarter last year, where revenue stood at $47.3 million. Zynex’s financial outlook for the first quarter of 2025 anticipates revenue of $30 million and a projected net loss between $9 million and $10 million, partly due to a temporary TRICARE payment suspension affecting short-term guidance. Despite these challenges, the company maintains a strong gross profit margin of 78% and has increased its cash on the balance sheet by 5% from the previous quarter. The company is also focusing on diversifying into patient monitoring technologies, with anticipated revenue from this segment expected in late 2025 or 2026, pending FDA clearance of its new pulse oximeter. Analysts from firms such as Ladenburg and RBC have shown interest in Zynex’s strategies to address these issues, particularly the TRICARE payment suspension.

The medical technology company specializing in non-invasive devices for pain management, rehabilitation and patient monitoring saw 16% year-over-year growth in orders in 2024.

Net income for the year was $3 million or $0.09 per share, with cash flow from operations totaling $12.7 million.

Zynex CEO Thomas Sandgaard told shareholders that the firm is confident that its pain management business has ""significant growth potential"" in the long term, citing ongoing payer expansion efforts and progress with its NiCO laser pulse oximeter clinical trial, which produced positive results.

The NiCO pulse oximeter uses advanced laser technology to measure fractional blood oxygenation levels, offering greater accuracy than LED-based pulse oximeters, which have been found to misread oxygen levels in some populations, particularly individuals with darker skin tones.

""Over the long term we believe we will remain a leader of holistic, non-invasive approaches to pain management and patient monitoring and continue to pursue additional lines of revenue that improve patient outcomes and overall health,"" Sandgaard said in a statement.

For Q1 2025, Zynex expects revenue of at least $30 million.

Good relations with Tricare

For the fourth quarter of 2024, revenue was $46 million compared to $47.3 million in the year-ago quarter.

Zynex CEO Thomas Sandgaard attributed the shortfall to due to slower payments from some insurers and a temporary suspension of payments from Tricare, which represents 20% to 25% of Zynex's annual revenue.

“We continue to be in-network and have maintained good relations with Tricare,” Sandgaard said. “We have a meeting with Tricare in April and believe we have good evidence to get payments reinstated.”

To address this, Zynex is reducing staff by 15%, focusing on corporate roles, which along with other expense cuts is expected to save $35 million annually.

“Although these processes are never easy, it is critical for us to be prudent and conservative in adapting to external changes and execute these expense adjustments immediately,” Sandgaard said.",https://cdn.proactiveinvestors.com/eyJidWNrZXQiOiJwYS1jZG4iLCJrZXkiOiJ1cGxvYWRcL05ld3NcL0ltYWdlXC8yMDI1XzAzXC9TY3JlZW5zaG90LTIwMjMtMTAtMjMtYXQtMS0wMi0zOC1QTS5qcGciLCJlZGl0cyI6eyJyZXNpemUiOnsid2lkdGgiOjEyMDAsImhlaWdodCI6NjMwLCJmaXQiOiJjb3ZlciJ9fX0=,N,1.0,2025-03-12 00:50:24.966292

The company reported an EPS of -$0.02 compared to the forecasted $0.10, while revenue came in at $45.98 million, below the expected $53.3 million.

Outlook & Guidance

For Q1 2025, Zynex expects revenue of $30 million and a projected net loss of $9-10 million. The company did not provide full-year 2025 guidance due to a temporary suspension of TRICARE payments, which is currently under review. Zynex anticipates revenue from its patient monitoring segment in late 2025 or 2026, pending FDA clearance of its new pulse oximeter.

Executive Commentary

CEO Thomas Sandgaard stated, ""We are incredibly proud of the growth that we have consistently demonstrated over the past several years."" He emphasized the company’s diversification into patient monitoring, expecting it to contribute to revenue in the near future. Sandgaard also highlighted the company’s ability to adapt to market changes and maintain investments in its business.

Risks and Challenges

TRICARE Payment Suspension: The temporary suspension poses a risk to short-term revenue and earnings.

Market Competition: Intense competition in the medical device industry could impact market share.

Regulatory Approvals: Delays in FDA clearance for new products could affect future revenue streams.

Economic Conditions: Broader economic pressures could influence healthcare spending and reimbursement rates.

Q&A

During the earnings call, analysts inquired about the impact of the TRICARE payment suspension and the company’s strategies for addressing it. Zynex assured that a meeting is scheduled in April to discuss the issue and expressed confidence that no other payers would follow similar actions. The company also discussed commercialization strategies for its Neko pulse oximeter, highlighting its potential market impact once FDA clearance is obtained.

Joining me today on the call are Thomas Sandgaard, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer Dan Moorhead, Chief Financial Officer Anna Luksoch, Chief Operating Officer and Donald Gregg, President of Xynex Monitoring Solutions. Before we begin, I’d like to remind you that during this conference call, the company will make projections and forward looking statements regarding future events.

We encourage you to review the company’s past and future filings with the SEC, including, without limitation, the company’s 2024 Form 10 K and subsequent Form 10 Qs, which identify the specific factors that may cause actual results or events to differ materially from those described in these forward looking statements. These factors may include, without limitation, statements regarding product development, product potential, the regulatory environment, sales and marketing strategies, capital resources or operating performance. With that, I’ll now turn the call over to Thomas.

Thomas Sandgaard, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer, Xynex: Thanks, Brian, and good afternoon, everyone. Thank you for joining us today for the fourth quarter and full year twenty twenty four earnings call. 2024 was a successful year for Cynex as we continue to grow revenue and drive profitability. We have made strides in diversifying our revenue streams with the addition of several new products, some internally developed and some manufactured and added private label products primarily in the areas of brazing, cold and compression products, all a perfect fit for our sales force’s call points in pain and rehab. We’ve also expanded the focus of our sales force to additional new prescribers of pain and rehab products such as national change of workers’ comp and the VA.

In a moment, Don Gregg will provide you with an update for our patient monitoring business and the FDA submission of our pulse oximeter. In late twenty twenty four, we received positive test results on our Neko pulse oximeter in multiple trials done at Duke University and at the University of California in San Francisco. Human trial completion is an essential step prior to our 05/10 submission to the FCA. The data from the trials have been excellent in showing how much lower bias the current LED base compared to how the current LED base for oximeters exhibit, especially for skin with darker pigmentation. The old LED technology leads to inaccurate or inconsistent readings during clinical or critical times for a patient, which has been widely criticized in the media and politically.

We believe that our laser based system is a superior technology and has the opportunity to meaningfully impact patient outcomes. I would like Don Gregg provide more details on the status momentarily. We were recently notified by TRICARE that they were temporarily suspending payments to Cynex related to a review of prior claims. We have a meeting with them here in early April to get it all sorted out, but cannot at this point provide an estimate on when it will all be resolved. Anna will provide more details to her during her discussion of operations.

Given that TRICARE is a substantial source of reimbursement revenue, we currently have limited visibility in our revenue projections for 2025. And we have taken the most conservative approach to not include revenue in the later part of 2024, where some of those bills were submitted to TRICARE yet not paid. And in this current quarter forecast and therefore the corresponding lower revenue numbers. As part of a normal prudent cost containment measure, due to the possibility of a significant decrease in revenue short term, while we accelerate sales to other sales channels, we continue to make adjustments to the corporate and sales cost structure to ensure we have optimized our structure and expense profile and are set to continue our long term growth and profitability. And again, Anna will cover this in more detail.

We remain very optimistic about the future of Cynex. The improvement we have made in analytics and operations over the past many years will show significant benefits in the long term. As we continue to diversify the product mix and revenue stream, we believe we can actually better capture the $800,000,000 of identified sales opportunities within our 800 designated sales territories. In the patient monitoring business, we had just before FDA submission and once cleared that should generate revenue in a very well established multibillion dollar sales segment. Over the past twenty nine years since its inception, our growth has certainly not been in a straight line as long term shareholders would certainly acknowledge and the key for us is to keep focused on the long vision of growth and diversification and stay firm regardless of short term disruptions.

We trust that shareholders are on board with this strategy. Our recent challenges in 2024 were not only introducing new product that so far have collected less than expected. However, we see clear signs of improvement here in early twenty twenty five. Our sales force and staff has been restructured and we have made changes to sales management. These improvements are already beginning to take effect and puts us in a good position to deal with the temporary suspension payment suspension from TiCare, while we focus on growing in other areas.

Fortunately, we are in an industry where our potential call points for our sales force is nearly endless. We are still confident that our non invasive approach with at home pain management devices have real growth opportunities to provide non opioid relief to patients. We remain focused on ramping our hospital monitoring division, which represents a large and growing market opportunity with a better mousetrap than our competitors in the pulse oximeter market. I’ll now turn the call over to Anna Logsock to provide a more detailed update on the operations and the status with the TRICARE. Anna?

Anna Luksoch, Chief Operating Officer, Xynex: Thank you, Thomas. As Thomas mentioned, we were notified by TRICARE of a temporary suspension of payments if they complete their review. From a reimbursement perspective, TRICARE is one of our largest insurers. We’re currently working through the reinstatement process and have a meeting with Defense Health Agency to present our appeal in early April, but worst case, it could take as long as twelve months to complete. TRICARE represents between 20% to 25% of our revenue, so this is a significant reduction in revenue if the suspension were to be upheld.

I think it is important to note a few things relative to this news. We completed an audit with TRICARE as recently as 2022. In this audit, we made all of the necessary adjustments to billing practices that were outlined and we haven’t heard anything further since that time. We have demonstrated that we fully comply with those adjustments and have a good cause for eventually continued business as usual with TRICARE. During this temporary suspension, we remain in network with TRICARE and are expected to continue processing new and existing claims for treatment for TRICARE patients.

In fact, TRICARE has said that they want current and new patients to continue receiving care through this process per hour contract. If or when the reimbursements begin again, TRICARE would be responsible for paying all of the claims that have been processed during that temporary hold, which would show significantly increased revenue once received. Moving on to operations, our organization and staff levels, which will decrease overall staff by 15% and primarily affects employees in our corporate office along with other expense reductions made during the second half of twenty twenty four and Q1 twenty twenty five will result in annual savings of approximately $35,000,000 This is a normal and good business practice that all companies constantly undergo. In 2024, trimmed the sales force to ensure we have the right reps in place to put us in the best position moving forward. As of December 31, we had a sales force of approximately three thirty people as compared to the beginning of twenty twenty four, where we had approximately four seventy five people.

Progress takes time, but we have seen positive trends. Revenue increased 4% in 2024 and order growth was 16% in the year. The total number of reps was down, but the revenue per rep increased 22% to $490,000 on average in 2024. I’ll now turn the call over to Don Gregg to provide a more detailed update on the patient monitoring business. Don?

Donald Gregg, President of Xynex Monitoring Solutions, Xynex: Thank you, Anna. I want to provide an update on the progress of our neko pulse oximeter. Although our FDA submission has been delayed into 2025, we are closing on major milestones to commercialize the neko pulse oximeter. Neko verification human trials completed in fourth quarter of twenty twenty four at Duke University with positive results as planned. Xynex’s neko pulse oximeter utilizes precise laser technology to measure blood oxygenation levels directly as opposed to current LED pulse oximeter products, which only estimate oxygenation levels.

LED pulse oximeters have been shown to miss measure oxygen levels in several populations most prominently in individuals with darker skin pigmentation. We presented a poster of our study from the University of California, San Francisco Hypoxia Lab at Anesthesiology twenty twenty four in the fourth quarter. Four nCo pulse oximeters and two different commercially available LED based pulse oximeters were used on each participant. Conclusions from the study showed the nCo pulse oximeter did not demonstrate a bias for dark pigmented participants compared to lightly pigmented participants. By comparison, conventional LED based pulse oximeters in the present study read falsely higher on darkly pigmented participants specifically at lower oxygen saturation levels.

There have been published studies starting in the 1980s that detail how these inaccuracies were associated with disparities in care. Completed human trials were one of the last major milestones to complete prior to the FDA five ten submission. In late twenty twenty four and into 2025, Nikos have been undergoing third party regulatory ISO testing for compliance to safety and electrical standards. At this point, we anticipate FDA submission in the next thirty to sixty days following that completion. Based on historical submissions, approval takes approximately six months, which would mean a potential fourth quarter twenty twenty five clearance barring any uncertainty of FDA review resources.

Also in December of twenty twenty four, we announced our membership in the Open Oximetry Project, a nonprofit oximetry partnership of research organizations and industries created to improve the safety and precision of pulse oximeters in all populations. Xynex is pushing to be a key industry partner to all clinicians and show how the Neko pulse oximeter technology inherently solves the current market challenges, especially skin pigmentation bias, while bringing new precision medicine forward in the field of pulse oximetry. In summary, we’ve achieved major milestones in Q4 of twenty twenty four on NECA commercial development, clinical verification and we are very close to FDA five ten submission. Patient monitoring is a multi billion dollar market that we believe we can enter with a superior product that can meaningfully improve care to a broad range of patients when they need it most. I will now turn the call over to Dan Morehead, Chief Financial Officer for a more in-depth look at the quarter’s financial performance.

Dan Moorhead, Chief Financial Officer, Xynex: Thanks, Don. Please refer to our press release issued earlier today for a summary of our financial results for the fourth quarter and year ended 12/31/2024. Net revenue was $46,000,000 compared to $47,300,000 in the fourth quarter of twenty twenty three. Device revenue was $14,800,000 compared to $16,300,000 in the fourth quarter of last year. Supplies revenue was $31,200,000 up from $31,000,000 in the fourth quarter of last year.

Device revenue was lower during the quarter due to some product mix shift to lower priced products such as braces and other products that have lower price points than the Next Wave devices. Gross profit in the fourth quarter was $36,000,000 or 78% of revenue as compared to $37,000,000 also 78% of revenue in 2023. Sales and marketing expenses were $19,300,000 in the fourth quarter of twenty twenty four compared to $21,700,000 in the same period in 2023. The primary contributor to the decrease in sales and marketing expenses was our headcount reduction of roughly 140 sales team members. G and A expenses were $17,300,000 in the fourth quarter of twenty twenty four compared to $13,000,000 last year largely due to ZMS increased expenses and professional fees.

Net loss was $615,000 or $0.02 per share in the fourth quarter of twenty twenty four compared to net income of $1,200,000 or $0.04 per share in Q4 of twenty twenty three. Adjusted EBITDA for the three months ended 12/31/2024 was $584,000 as compared to $9,900,000 in the quarter ended 12/31/2023. Cash flows from operations were $2,400,000 in Q4 and $12,700,000 for the full year. The cash flow in the quarter and year increased our cash on the balance sheet to $39,600,000 up 5% from Q3’s balance of $37,600,000 Working capital was $58,300,000 as of December 31. With that, I’ll now turn the call back over to Thomas.

Thomas Sandgaard, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer, Xynex: Yes. Thank you, Dan. The beginning of 2025 was certainly not as smooth as we had hoped, but we are optimistic about the long term prospects of the company and the opportunities we have going forward. That still has not changed. Because of the uncertainty surrounding payments here short term for TRICARE, we will not be providing full 2025 annual guidance yet, given the lack of visibility surrounding the temporary payments suspension.

We are obviously still in network with TRICARE and continue to accept new prescriptions for the instructions. When we learn more information throughout the year, we’ll be better able to communicate expectations and update everyone. At this stage, we anticipate the first quarter this year revenue of approximately $30,000,000 We will likely have a net loss in the first quarter ranging between $9,000,000 and $10,000,000 as a result of not all restructuring having taken effect yet. Throughout this year, we will look to make adjustments to the cost structures as needed. Fundamentally, with or without TRICARE as a payer, we still have a rock solid business that will continue to grow towards revenues of $800,000,000 plus in the pain management division.

Our diversification into the patient monitoring area is set to start adding revenue late this year and next year pending FDA clearance. We’re incredibly proud of the growth that we have consistently demonstrated over the past several years. Just ten years ago, our revenues were nearly 20 times lower than now. And in the meantime, we’ve been able to buy back over $80,000,000 worth of stock in the open market and we had a cash balance of $40,000,000 at the end of twenty twenty four. Well, ten years ago, we were scraping the bottom of our bank account daily to pay our bills.

Looking forward, we believe we have additional customers and revenue streams that can drive further growth. The business we have created and the profitability we are able to generate allows us to have a high degree of flexibility to allocate capital in several ways and deal with temporary difficult situations like this. We have shown the ability to adjust to market customer and reimbursement changes and continue to invest in our business and return cash to shareholders. With that, operator, please open the call up for questions.

Conference Operator: Your first question comes from the line of Jeffrey Cohen from Ladenburg. Please

Jeffrey Cohen, Analyst, Ladenburg: go. Hi. Thanks for taking our questions. Just a couple from our end. So when you talk about the stock reductions of 15 ish percent, could you give us a sense of what was accomplished in the fourth quarter?

And then also give us a sense of how that will affect your two OpEx lines, both the sales line and the G and A

Dan Moorhead, Chief Financial Officer, Xynex: Yes, I would say the we probably did if you’re looking at $30,000,000 plus in annual savings, I would say a little less than half of it was done during 2024, but you wouldn’t see all of it because obviously you’re looking at run rates and those types of things. So they were a lot of those were implemented in the second half and then the remaining pieces were done in Q1 with some of that coming late in Q1. So So, if you’re looking at sales expenses and those types of things, as far as run rate, Q4 sales, we just posted $19,300,000 I think that number is definitely coming down and that has been coming down for the past few quarters as you know. So it’s probably down $1,500,000 to $2,000,000 on the run rate going forward and then G and A you’re going to see the same thing down a couple of million dollars a quarter based on what we did in Q4. And those will actually continue to come down in Q2 a little bit as well.

Like I said, a lot of those changes were put in at the end or middle to end of Q1.

Jeffrey Cohen, Analyst, Ladenburg: Yes. So I guess the M30 on an annual basis for 2025, does it hit both the sales and marketing as well as the G and A the same percentage or is it going to be more heavily weighted on the sales and marketing one?

Dan Moorhead, Chief Financial Officer, Xynex: No, it’d be more on the G and A because the G and A is a smaller number too. So it’s going to be a bigger number out of this smaller number. Sales was already decreasing based on the trimming that Anna talked about and those types of things. So I think as a percentage, it’s going to be more on the G and A line, but both are going to be decreasing by, like I said, run rate, you’re looking at close to $2,000,000 compared to what we did in Q4.

Jeffrey Cohen, Analyst, Ladenburg: Got it. Okay. And then secondly, maybe for Thomas or for Don, could you hypothesize with us a little bit about NYCOX and the commercial path to market that you’re anticipating? Are you hypothesizing going direct yourselves with a commercial organization? Are you hypothesizing partners or different setups for different channels?

Donald Gregg, President of Xynex Monitoring Solutions, Xynex: So this is Don. We have a strategy that actually leverages all three of those. As you look at penetrating the market as we would get clearance and potentially in Q4, twenty twenty six certainly would be the year of ramp for that. We have been in discussions with potential partners, not just distribution partners, but partners that would potentially take the device and put it in their sales bag. We have had discussions through what it would look like as part of a direct sales force, where we would start with particular hospitals and IDNs.

And then third of all, we have looked at an indirect sales force of potential ten ninety nine of organizations that sell both capital and disposable equipment in this. And so we’re poised to be ready to pull the trigger when we have clearance and covered the entire plan with Thomas and our executive leaders.

Jeffrey Cohen, Analyst, Ladenburg: Okay, perfect. That does it for us. Thanks for taking our questions.

Conference Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Shagun Singh from RBC. Your line is now open.

Shagun Singh, Analyst, RBC: Hey, good afternoon. This is Avi on for Shidoon. I have a few questions. First, what was the nature of the 2022 audit by TRICARE related to billing practice practices? And I guess why didn’t you have any visibility to TRICARE ahead of time before this happened?

Anna Luksoch, Chief Operating Officer, Xynex: So the nature of the audit was a routine post payment audit. It’s very common from most insurance companies. And the type of adjustments that were suggested during the audit were also fairly standard. So nothing major was identified or adjusted.

Shagun Singh, Analyst, RBC: Okay. Could you I guess that’s helpful. Why don’t you have you only gave Q1 sales guidance, not 2025 obviously, but like why don’t you have the visibility into sales? You have still 75% of your business or so that is being reimbursed. Could there be a domino effect?

What conversations are you having with other payers?

Thomas Sandgaard, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer, Xynex: No, there’s really no connection here. This is totally isolated. We do obviously internally have some numbers that are if TRICARE end up never paying us anything or if they don’t start picking up payments until the end of the year, we’re pretty confident that at some point throughout the year, they will eventually get through this conversation with them and basically prove that, hey, we did everything you asked for, what’s your problem. It’s been very unclear exactly what it is that they’re looking for. So and because TRICARE is such a big part of our revenue, we obviously the difference in the guidance we will give is many tens of millions dollars, if not more than $50,000,000 right?

So therefore, we’d like to

Jeffrey Cohen, Analyst, Ladenburg: have a

Thomas Sandgaard, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer, Xynex: little more clarity into our dialogue with TRICARE before we get to revenue guidance. What we are doing is to make sure in a worst case scenario, let’s keep doing what we always should be doing, make sure we trim expenses and restructure the organization to be able to handle even worst case scenarios.

Shagun Singh, Analyst, RBC: Great. And the last question is, what’s your plan like to present at this April meeting with TRICARE? Have they told you any details on what they are they requesting anything? Or do you have, I guess, data to show them to whatever to help them figure it out, whatever it is that they exactly need from you?

Anna Luksoch, Chief Operating Officer, Xynex: Yes. They gave us some big guidance on what they’re looking for. It’s still very unclear what exactly their problem is, but we have lots of data to present to them on specifically regarding policies that we’re following. We will be referring back to the 2022 audit and the findings of that audit and adjustments. There were some directions we received during the audit that we’ll be highlighting in that presentation.

So that’s mainly going to be our focus.

Shagun Singh, Analyst, RBC: Thank you.

Conference Operator: Your last question comes from the line of Yi Chen from H. C. Wainwright. Please go ahead.

Yi Chen, Analyst, H.C. Wainwright: Hi. Thank you for taking my questions. Could you comment on what specific factors that triggered TRICARE to start reviewing your prior claims. And is it a typical practice that during the review process payers would temporarily suspend payments?

Anna Luksoch, Chief Operating Officer, Xynex: We’re unclear on specific triggers at this point because they haven’t communicated clearly what the issue is. As far as these type of reviews, I mean post payment reviews among payers are very common. We undergo multiple audits or post payment reviews from several different payers on a monthly basis. Payment suspension is somewhat common. It’s not the usual practice, but it happens with other payers as well.

Yi Chen, Analyst, H.C. Wainwright: So are you worried that the other payers could potentially follow TRICU and start reviewing claims and suspend payments to you?

Thomas Sandgaard, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer, Xynex: We don’t see any connection. I mean, it’s across the board. We deal with 3,000 insurance companies every all the time and these things happen with small insurance companies, large insurance carriers. TRICARE is a big one, obviously. So therefore, we have taken this very conservative approach, but these guys all operate very independently.

There’s really no connection. And this is a government payer. It’s not in the private sector. So there’s already there, but a bit big disconnect.

Yi Chen, Analyst, H.C. Wainwright: And just trying to clarify, did you mention that this kind of process could potentially take up to twelve months to resolve?

Shagun Singh, Analyst, RBC: What does the letter say?

Anna Luksoch, Chief Operating Officer, Xynex: Yes. The letter from Defense Health Agency stated this is a temporary payment suspension and it could be up to twelve months. But we are given an opportunity to present an appeal within thirty days, which we have a meeting scheduled in the April. And we’ll know more after that meeting.

Thomas Sandgaard, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer, Xynex: And yet to have the nerve to demand that we still treat and send supplies to existing patients and keep accepting new patients and treat them 100% like we always have except the from Sendus payment in the meantime. Not very nice, but that’s the reality at least for now.

Yi Chen, Analyst, H.C. Wainwright: Does the claims made to TRICARE cover a specific territories in the country or it’s across the country?

Anna Luksoch, Chief Operating Officer, Xynex: They’re national, they’re across the country?

Thomas Sandgaard, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer, Xynex: Yes. Actually one of their letters, Amber, had an interesting statement in it that we were one of their very valued providers and they really appreciate working with us. Obviously, we provide opioid free pain management to TRICARE patients. That’s obviously a pretty big deal for what we do for all those patients.

Yi Chen, Analyst, H.C. Wainwright: Great. Thank you for taking my question.

Conference Operator: There are no further questions at this time. I’d like to turn the call over to Thomas Sandgaard for closing remarks. Sir, please go ahead.

Thomas Sandgaard, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer, Xynex: Yes. Thank you for joining us today. Although disappointing, we’re still overall long term pleased with our performance and where things are headed. And last year, obviously, we ended up with a decent financial result and the consistent growth that our team is delivering. We look forward to leveraging our momentum and the changes we are making to the organization and the direction of our sales force throughout 2025.

And we look forward to speaking to you at upcoming investor events. Appreciate your time and interest in Cynex. Have a great day.

Conference Operator: This concludes today’s conference call. Thank you very much for your participation. You may now disconnect.

Zynex Inc., a leading provider of electrotherapy and rehabilitation products, has released its 2024 10-K report, detailing the company's financial performance, business operations, strategic initiatives, and the challenges it faces. The report provides a comprehensive overview of Zynex's efforts to expand its market presence, develop new products, and manage operational risks in a competitive industry.

Financial Highlights

Total net revenue: $192.4 million, reflecting a 4% increase from the previous year driven by a 16% growth in device orders.

Income from operations: $6.0 million, a decrease from $10.8 million in the prior year, primarily due to increased general and administrative expenses.

Net income: $3.0 million, down from $9.7 million in 2023, impacted by higher operating expenses and interest expense.

Net income per share: $0.09, compared to $0.27 in the previous year, reflecting the decrease in net income.

Cash flows from operating activities: $12.7 million, a decrease of 28% from the prior year, attributed to lower profitability and changes in working capital.

Business Highlights

Revenue Segments: Zynex Medical, Inc. (ZMI) accounts for substantially all of the company's revenue, primarily from electrotherapy products and private labeled rehabilitation products. The primary product is the NexWave device, which requires consumable supplies like electrodes and batteries.

Sales Units: The company achieved a 16% increase in device orders in 2024, indicating strong demand for its electrotherapy products.

New Product Launches: In 2024, ZMI launched the M-Wave, a user-friendly NMES device designed for muscle stimulation and re-education, which was cleared by the FDA in February 2024.

New Product Development: Zynex Monitoring Solutions (ZMS) is developing the NiCO™ CO-Oximeter and HemeOx™ Total Hemoglobin Oximeter, which are laser-based and designed to address inaccuracies in traditional pulse oximeters. NiCO is anticipated to be submitted to the FDA for clearance in Q1 2025.

Future Outlook: The company is focused on expanding its sales force to address the untapped market for electrotherapy products and pain management, with a goal of increasing performance management standards for its sales force.

Operational Adjustments: Due to a temporary payment suspension by TriCare, which represents 20-25% of annual revenue, the company is restructuring its staff, reducing overall staff by approximately 10% to align with current revenue.

Research and Development: The company incurred approximately $12.0 million in operating expenses related to ZMS operations in 2024, with a focus on developing new monitoring solutions.

Human Capital: As of December 31, 2024, Zynex employed approximately 1,000 full-time employees, emphasizing competitive pay, benefits, and training programs to attract and retain talent.

Strategic Initiatives

Strategic Initiatives: The company has focused on expanding its business through the issuance of $52.5 million in Convertible Senior Notes, with an additional $7.5 million issued upon the exercise of an over-allotment option. This capital is intended to support business expansion and operational growth. The company also completed multiple IRB-approved clinical studies and a hypoxemia study, indicating a strategic focus on research and development in the medical device sector.

Capital Management: The company repurchased approximately $15.6 million worth of its common stock as part of a $20 million repurchase program authorized by the board. This program is intended to enhance shareholder value and is set to continue through March 2025 or until the full amount is repurchased. The company maintains a strong liquidity position with $39.6 million in cash and cash equivalents and a working capital of $58.3 million. The company has also managed its debt effectively, with interest on the Convertible Senior Notes payable semiannually.

Future Outlook: The company plans to continue its strategic focus on expanding its business and maintaining a strong liquidity position. It anticipates using cash to fund business expansion and has planned capital expenditures of approximately $1.5 million during 2025. The company is also confident in its long-term growth potential in the pain management business, despite current challenges with TriCare payment suspensions.

Challenges and Risks

Economic and Market Risks: Unfavorable global economic conditions, including military conflicts and pandemics, could adversely affect the company's business and financial condition. Rapid technological changes could render the company's products obsolete if it fails to enhance its offerings.

Operational Risks: The company is dependent on third-party payers for reimbursement, and changes in insurance reimbursement policies could decrease revenues. The reliance on sole suppliers for certain components and potential disruptions in the supply chain, especially for semiconductor chips, pose significant risks.

Regulatory Risks: Compliance with healthcare laws and regulations, including the Anti-Kickback Statute and the False Claims Act, is critical. Failure to comply could result in substantial penalties. The company also faces risks related to maintaining regulatory clearances for its products.

Cybersecurity Risks: The company is vulnerable to cyber-attacks and security breaches, which could lead to reduced revenue, increased costs, and damage to its reputation.

Financial Risks: The conversion feature of convertible senior notes may adversely affect the company's financial condition. Changes in financial accounting standards could also impact reported results.

Management's Commitment: Management is committed to addressing the identified material weaknesses in internal controls over financial reporting. The company is developing and implementing remediation plans to strengthen its internal controls and ensure accurate financial reporting.

Market Risks: Zynex, Inc. is exposed to market risks, including fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, which may adversely affect its financial results. The company is also subject to risks related to changes in interest rates, which could impact its financial condition and results of operations.

“We continue to be in-network and have maintained good relations with Tricare,” Sandgaard said.","Zynex Inc (NASDAQ:ZYXI) reported full-year revenue has grown 4% to reach $192.4 million in the 2024 financial year.

The medical technology company specializing in non-invasive devices for pain management, rehabilitation and patient monitoring saw 16% year-over-year growth in orders in 2024.

Net income for the year was $3 million or $0.09 per share, with cash flow from operations totaling $12.7 million.

Zynex CEO Thomas Sandgaard told shareholders that the firm is confident that its pain management business has ""significant growth potential"" in the long term, citing ongoing payer expansion efforts and progress with its NiCO laser pulse oximeter clinical trial, which produced positive results.

The NiCO pulse oximeter uses advanced laser technology to measure fractional blood oxygenation levels, offering greater accuracy than LED-based pulse oximeters, which have been found to misread oxygen levels in some populations, particularly individuals with darker skin tones.

""Over the long term we believe we will remain a leader of holistic, non-invasive approaches to pain management and patient monitoring and continue to pursue additional lines of revenue that improve patient outcomes and overall health,"" Sandgaard said in a statement.

For Q1 2025, Zynex expects revenue of at least $30 million.

Good relations with Tricare

For the fourth quarter of 2024, revenue was $46 million compared to $47.3 million in the year-ago quarter.

Zynex CEO Thomas Sandgaard attributed the shortfall to due to slower payments from some insurers and a temporary suspension of payments from Tricare, which represents 20% to 25% of Zynex's annual revenue.

“We continue to be in-network and have maintained good relations with Tricare,” Sandgaard said. “We have a meeting with Tricare in April and believe we have good evidence to get payments reinstated.”

To address this, Zynex is reducing staff by 15%, focusing on corporate roles, which along with other expense cuts is expected to save $35 million annually.

“Although these processes are never easy, it is critical for us to be prudent and conservative in adapting to external changes and execute these expense adjustments immediately,” Sandgaard said.",https://cdn.proactiveinvestors.com/eyJidWNrZXQiOiJwYS1jZG4iLCJrZXkiOiJ1cGxvYWRcL05ld3NcL0ltYWdlXC8yMDI1XzAzXC9TY3JlZW5zaG90LTIwMjMtMTAtMjMtYXQtMS0wMi0zOC1QTS5qcGciLCJlZGl0cyI6eyJyZXNpemUiOnsid2lkdGgiOjEyMDAsImhlaWdodCI6NjMwLCJmaXQiOiJjb3ZlciJ9fX0=,N,1.0,2025-03-11 17:50:27.626721

Management Commentary

""In the fourth quarter of 2024 we continued our steady growth in orders and delivered another year of revenue growth and profitability,"" said Thomas Sandgaard, President and CEO of Zynex. ""We generated $12.7 million of positive cash flow from operations and $10.9 million of Adjusted EBITDA in 2024.

""Our fourth quarter revenue was less than expected. The shortfall was due to slower than normal payments from certain payers and we were recently notified that Tricare has temporarily suspended payments as they review prior claims. We continue to be in-network and have maintained good relations with Tricare. We have a meeting with Tricare in April and believe we have good evidence to get payments reinstated. TriCare currently represents approximately 20-25% of our annual revenue. As directed by Tricare, we continue to support both existing patients and new patients as we receive their prescriptions.

""Due to the temporary payment suspension and lack of clarity on the timing of a resolution, we are restructuring our staff to align with current revenue. We are decreasing our overall staff by approximately 15%, which primarily affects employees in our corporate departments. This staff reduction along with other expense reductions made during the second half of 2024 and the first quarter of 2025 will result in savings of approximately $35 million annually. Although these processes are never easy, it is critical for us to be prudent and conservative in adapting to external changes and execute these expense adjustments immediately. We are confident that long-term, our pain management business is still solid with significant growth potential.

""We continue to accelerate our payer expansion and expect it to offset some of the near-term revenue challenges. Building relationships with new payers is a process, but we have been working on expansion in several areas during 2024 and expect those to start yielding results in 2025.

""Additionally, we completed the NiCO laser pulse oximeter human clinical trial at Duke University with positive results. The NiCO pulse oximeter utilizes highly precise laser technology to measure fractional blood oxygenation levels, compared to LED-based pulse oximeter products which have been shown to incorrectly estimate oxygen levels in several populations, most prominently in individuals with darker skin pigmentation.

""We maintain a flexible and healthy balance sheet and it's important to note over the past few years we have been able to buy back over $80 million worth of shares on the open market, directly increasing shareholder value.

""Over the long term we believe we will remain a leader of holistic, non-invasive approaches to pain management and patient monitoring and continue to pursue additional lines of revenue that improve patient outcomes and overall health,"" concluded Sandgaard.

Soldiers, family members and dedicated members of the Army community gathered to support a program that has, since 1942, supported the Army based on the premise of Soldiers helping Soldiers.

AER’s mission is to promote financial readiness and help Soldiers and Family members in times of need by providing grants, interest free loans and scholarships.

Just a few of the ways AER can help include:

Housing — utility and rent deposits, mortgages, small home repairs and more.

Personal vehicles — repairs, rental vehicles and car seats.

Medical — dental and medical expenses not covered by TRICARE, children’s cranial helmets and more.

AER also offers a Quick Assist Program that allows the chain of command to provide immediate assistance. A company commander or first sergeant can approve loans up to $2,000.

Those eligible include:

• Active-duty retired and medically retired Soldiers and their eligible dependents.

•Army Reserve and National Guard Soldiers on active duty for more than 30 consecutive days and their eligible dependents.

•Army Reserve and National Guard Soldiers who are retiring and receiving DFAS retired pay and their eligible dependents.

•Surviving spouses and children of Soldiers who died on active duty or as retirees.

AER has provided more than 2 billion in assistance since 1942.

Many of those in attendance raised their hands when asked if they had been helped by AER.

Spc. Luther Blount, one of the Soldiers who has benefitted from AER assistance, said the program helped him with his chosen career training.

“There were costs and unexpected challenges associated with that training. Thanks to an AER grant, I was able to cover those expenses. This allowed me to focus on my traing and gain the knowledge and experience I needed to succeed in my career,” Blount said. “It gave me peace of mind that I was able to take full advantage of these career opportunities. I want to express my deepest gratitude to AER.

Blount also encouraged his fellow Soldiers to explore these resources.

As a private and a recently divorced single mom trying to make ends meet, Staff Sgt Jessica Lattimore also received help from the AER program.

“AER gave me a loan that helped me reset some of my payments and spread them out enough that I was able to survive for the whole month and have my boys still be comfortable,” Lattimore said. “Because of AER and being able to reset my finances, I was able to continue on in the Army. I’m a staff sergeant now and I love my job.”

Col. Mark Andres, acting commanding officer of JRTC and Fort Johnson, said AER helps Army Soldiers in need based on the generosity of other Soldiers.

Andres said Fort Johnson didn’t do too well last year because we didn’t meet the installation’s goal.

“Last year at Fort Johnson, AER helped 247 active-duty service members and their families to just shy of $240 thousand, but our active-duty contributions to AER were only half of the $78 thousand total,” he said.

Andreas challenged Soldiers to do better this year.

“I think that we, as active-duty military, can contribute our heart. The potential for us to help each other is huge,” he said.

As the breakfast ended, Soldiers began filling out their contribution cards.

2017 Ford F-350 King Ranch: More Than Just a Truck My Ford F-350 King Ranch has been more than just a vehicle; it’s been a faithful companion, a powerful workhorse, and a luxury cruiser all rolled into one.","When I first saw that gleaming 2017 Ford F-350 King Ranch, I knew my life was about to change. As a long-time truck enthusiast, I’d always dreamed of owning a vehicle that combined raw power with unparalleled luxury. Little did I know that this used Super Duty would exceed my wildest expectations and become an integral part of my daily life and adventures.

The Decision

I’d been searching for a robust, reliable truck for months. My work often requires hauling heavy equipment, and I wanted something that could handle tough jobs while still being comfortable for long drives. When I stumbled upon this used 2017 F-350 King Ranch, it was love at first sight. The rich, bronze fire metallic paint gleamed in the sunlight, and the unmistakable King Ranch badging promised a level of sophistication I’d only dreamed of.

First Impressions

Sliding into the driver’s seat for the first time, I was immediately struck by the luxurious interior. The Mesa Brown leather seats, embossed with the King Ranch logo, were as comfortable as they were stylish. The expansive dashboard, with its mix of high-tech displays and classic styling, made me feel like I was piloting a private jet rather than a pickup truck.

But it wasn’t until I fired up the engine that I truly understood what I’d gotten myself into. The 6.7-liter Power Stroke V8 turbo diesel engine roared to life, its 440 horsepower and staggering 925 lb-ft of torque promising performance that would make light work of any task I could throw at it.

Capabilities That Astound

One of the first things I did with my new truck was to put its towing capabilities to the test. With a maximum towing capacity of up to 9,525 kg when properly equipped, I knew it could handle just about anything. I hooked up a large horse trailer, loaded with two horses and all their gear, and set off for a weekend camping trip in the mountains.

The F-350 didn’t just pull the trailer; it made the entire journey feel effortless. The integrated trailer brake controller and trailer sway control gave me confidence on winding mountain roads, while the truck’s powerful engine meant I barely noticed the extra weight, even on steep inclines.

Off-Road Adventures

While the F-350 King Ranch is undoubtedly luxurious, it’s far from being just a pretty face. I’ve taken it on several off-road adventures, and it’s never failed to impress. The 4×4 system, coupled with the electronic-locking rear differential, allows this beast to easily navigate challenging terrain.

One memorable trip took me deep into a remote forest, where the trails were muddy and riddled with obstacles. The truck’s impressive ground clearance (about 203 mm) meant I could clear fallen branches and rocks without worry. The hill descent control came in handy on steep declines, allowing me to focus on steering while the truck managed its speed automatically.

Daily Driving Comfort

What’s truly remarkable about the F-350 King Ranch is how it manages to be both a workhorse and a comfortable daily driver. Despite its size (measuring about 6.3 meters in length), it’s surprisingly manageable in urban environments. The adaptive steering system adjusts the steering ratio based on speed, making low-speed maneuvers in tight spaces much easier than you’d expect from a truck this size.

The interior is a cocoon of comfort and technology. The SYNC 3 infotainment system, with its responsive 8-inch touchscreen, keeps me connected and entertained on long drives. The premium Sony audio system turns the spacious cabin into a concert hall on wheels, perfect for those solo road trips or when I’m hauling the family to our favorite camping spots.

Fuel Efficiency: A Pleasant Surprise

Given the size and power of the F-350, I was ready for it to be a gas guzzler. However, I’ve been pleasantly surprised by its fuel efficiency, especially on long highway drives. While it’s not going to win any eco-awards, the advanced diesel engine technology means I can often achieve around 14 liters per 100 km on the highway, which is impressive for a truck of this capability.

Hauling and Payload

The bed of the F-350 has become my mobile workshop. With a payload capacity of up to 3,461 kg, I’ve used it to haul everything from construction materials for home renovation projects to a full load of firewood for winter. The spray-in bedliner has proven invaluable, protecting the bed from scratches and dents while keeping cargo from sliding around.

One particularly memorable project involved transporting a vintage motorcycle I was restoring. The truck’s bed, measuring about 2 meters in length (on the short bed model), easily accommodated the bike and all my tools and spare parts. The LED box lighting came in handy when I had to unload in the evening, providing ample illumination without draining the battery.

Technology That Impresses

The 2017 model year brought significant technological advancements to the F-350 lineup, and the King Ranch trim takes full advantage of these features. The 360-degree camera system has been a game-changer for parking and maneuvering in tight spaces. It’s also incredibly useful when hitching trailers, allowing me to align the hitch perfectly on the first try every time.

The adaptive cruise control is another feature I’ve come to rely on during long highway drives. It maintains a set distance from the vehicle ahead, automatically adjusting speed as needed. This, combined with the lane-keeping assist system, makes long journeys much less fatiguing.

Winter Performance

Living in an area with harsh winters, I was eager to see how the F-350 would handle snowy and icy conditions. I’m happy to report that it’s been nothing short of exceptional. The 4×4 system and the truck’s substantial weight provide excellent traction in slippery conditions. The heated seats and steering wheel have been a godsend on cold mornings, quickly taking the chill out of the air.

I’ve even used the truck to help pull out several stranded vehicles during particularly heavy snowfalls. The class-exclusive live-drive power takeoff provision has allowed me to operate a snow plow, turning my F-350 into a neighborhood hero during major storms.

A Mobile Office

As someone who often needs to work on the go, I’ve found the F-350 King Ranch an excellent mobile office. The spacious center console easily accommodates my laptop, while the multiple USB ports and 110V/400W outlet keep all my devices charged. The quiet cabin, aided by sound-deadening materials and the noise-reducing properties of the diesel engine, allows me to take calls and participate in video conferences without any background noise issues.

Adventures with Friends and Family

Perhaps the most joy I’ve gotten from my F-350 has been sharing it with friends and family. The Crew Cab configuration means plenty of room for passengers, with the rear seats offering a generous 1,107 mm of legroom. I’ve taken groups of friends on fishing trips, with plenty of space in the bed for all our gear and coolers.

The smooth ride and comfortable interior mean even long journeys are enjoyable. The kids love the spacious back seat, and the dual-zone climate control ensures everyone stays comfortable, regardless of personal temperature preferences.

Maintenance and Reliability

Owning a used vehicle always comes with some concerns about reliability, but my 2017 F-350 has been rock solid. I’ve stayed on top of regular maintenance, and the truck has rewarded me with consistent, trouble-free performance. The diesel engine, known for its longevity, shows no signs of slowing down even with the kilometers I’ve put on it.

2017 Ford F-350 King Ranch: More Than Just a Truck

My Ford F-350 King Ranch has been more than just a vehicle; it’s been a faithful companion, a powerful workhorse, and a luxury cruiser all rolled into one. It’s expanded what I thought was possible with a pickup truck, enabling me to take on projects and adventures I never would have considered before.

This truck has done everything from hauling heavy loads and conquering off-road trails to comfortable daily driving and family road trips. It’s been equally at home on muddy construction sites and valet parking at upscale restaurants. The combination of raw power, advanced technology, and luxurious comfort impresses me every time I get behind the wheel.

Owning this F-350 King Ranch has not just met my needs; it’s inspired me to dream bigger, to take on more challenging projects, and to explore further off the beaten path. It’s more than lived up to the Ford “Built Tough” slogan, proving itself a reliable partner in both work and play. As I look back on all the memories I’ve made and adventures I’ve had with this truck, I can say with certainty that choosing this 2017 Ford F-350 King Ranch was one of the best decisions I’ve ever made.",https://highburyford.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/2017_Ford_F-350_King_Ranch.jpg,N,0.0,2025-03-11 17:50:52.312347

In his opening statement, Chairman Wicker discussed the “peacetime effect” on military medical readiness, suggesting that there has been an erosion of physician capability and expertise that could result in unnecessary casualties during wartime. The Chairman encouraged an open conversation about reforms to the bureaucracy and policy changes that could improve the standing of military medical readiness before a major military conflict.

Read Senator Wicker’s hearing opening statement as delivered below.

The hearing will come to order.

The committee has convened this hearing to discuss the state of the military health system. We hope to shine a light on the challenges facing that system and begin working toward solutions.

Our witnesses are experts in the field of military medicine. Dr. Douglas Robb is a retired Air Force Lieutenant General and the former director of the Defense Health Agency (DHA). Dr. Paul Friedrichs is a retired Air Force Major General and the former Joint Staff Surgeon. And Dr. Jeremy Cannon is a retired Air Force Colonel and trauma surgeon who currently serves on the faculty at the University of Pennsylvania School of Medicine.

I look forward to their testimony. I want to hear their recommendations about what Congress and the Department of Defense should do to provide long-term stability to the military health system.

Military medicine often follows a familiar but regrettable cycle. During peacetime, medical teams focus on the treatment of ordinary illnesses. When conflict erupts, military medicine is frequently caught unprepared, resulting in unnecessary casualties.

This interwar erosion of our unique military medical skills is known as the “peacetime effect.” To disrupt the “peacetime effect,” Congress enacted sweeping reforms of the military health system. These reforms, now nearly a decade old, were designed to refocus military medicine on its primary purpose: combat casualty care and medical readiness.

We elevated the Defense Health Agency to a combat support agency and tasked it with administration of all military hospitals and clinics, relieving the military departments of that mission. The goal was to have the military services focus exclusively on the medical readiness of their forces. These ideas were recommended by an independent, bipartisan commission embraced by Pentagon leadership, and signed into law in 2017.

Unfortunately, opponents of these reforms have delayed implementation and undermined the effectiveness of the legislation. For example, in 2019, the military departments implemented drastic cuts to military medical personnel on the faulty assumption that it would be easy for DHA to hire civilians to take their places.

This assumption was misguided, which became evident during the COVID pandemic. During that crisis, the existing national physician shortage accelerated. To this day, private sector health systems seek out and hire away doctors from the military, not the other way around.

We've all seen this in our states. In 2020, Congress ordered a halt to any additional military medical reductions, but it was too late. A significant number of reductions had already occurred, severely reducing the capability of military hospitals. In many locations, the private sector was unable to handle the additional patients, sending more service members to private sector care. This has proven more expensive and has sapped the military doctors’ experiences that are vital to maintaining proficiency.

Even worse, DOD has refused to request adequate funding for DHA, which would allow DHA to staff adequately and equip its hospitals and clinics. Since 2015, the budget for military hospitals has decreased by nearly 12 percent. The water damage at Walter Reed this January is an example of the antiquated infrastructure that military medical teams work with around the world.

In addition to the problems I've just explained, I would like our witnesses to highlight how bureaucratic delays within the Department of Defense have prevented the military health system from preparing for the next potential conflict.

Combat casualty care is the primary purpose of the military health system. When service members are exposed to danger or are injured, they need to know that they will receive the best care possible. We know that troops in combat are more comfortable taking the risks necessary to accomplish their mission if they have confidence in military doctors.

We cannot go back to the way things were before 2017. We must stop scapegoating the Defense Health Agency. The Department of Defense must request adequate resources to ensure the Department’s hospitals and clinics are properly staffed and equipped. This is the best way to ensure the military health system is ready for the potential demands of large-scale combat operations in the future.",https://www.wicker.senate.gov/services/images/06DFDF3C-490D-4BBE-819D-CBDE440B3E04/social,N,0.0,2025-03-11 15:50:32.614242

We want to provide high-quality health care here in garrison, as any other top-performing health care system in America does, but we are the only ones that can go to war.
That makes us a unique and a very exciting and interesting health care system, because we must be ready to deliver health care in any corner of the globe at any time.
I think of health care as like an ecosystem where it takes everybody to build.","In one of his first interviews as Acting Assistant Secretary of Defense for Health Affairs, Dr. Stephen Ferrara stated the No. 1 priority for the Military Health System is supporting the warfighter, emphasizing the distinctive “go to war” nature of the MHS mission.

“The MHS is such a unique entity, and there isn’t anything similar in the private or public sector,” said Ferrara. “We are the U.S. health care system that goes to war.”

Ferrara is a retired U.S. Navy doctor who continued to practice medicine after 25 years on active duty until being appointed into his current role on Jan. 20, 2025. Prior to his present position, he served as the deputy director for clinical operations for the National Capital Region, the Department of Defense’s largest health care network. He also served as an interventional radiologist at Walter Reed National Military Medical Center and a clinical professor of radiology and radiological sciences at the Uniformed Services University of the Health Sciences.

Soon after assuming his new role, he met with MHS health care personnel at several military hospitals and clinics to see “granular detail that you can only get by going and talking to the people that are doing the work … because I want them to know that I am their voice and I'm there for them,” he said.

He explained the role of the Assistant Secretary is similar to a CEO of a global corporation. “I represent the civilian leadership oversight of the military, which makes me a conduit to the Secretary of Defense and to the White House,” Ferrara said. “I can help get what our folks need to be able to succeed and be that voice, because I know their priorities are to make sure we are delivering the best health care to not only our active duty, but our retired and dependent beneficiaries.”

The MHS has a worldwide mission to provide health care to more than 9 million people at over 800 medical and dental facilities, service-specific operational units, and the TRICARE Health Plan’s worldwide network of civilian providers.

In this interview, Ferrara discussed the MHS’ unique ability to deploy medical services globally, support readiness for future wars, and spearhead innovation in medical technology. He also shared his commitment for excellence and his personal investment in the MHS.

You can watch excerpts from the interview at this link (insert link).

Question: What drove you to join the U.S. Navy and become a military doctor?

Ferrara: I love telling this story. I joined the [U.S.] Navy, because I was a senior in college when the first Gulf War broke out and I was deciding which medical school to attend … some of us remember the surge of patriotism that was around at the time, and I reflected on it. My dad was a Korean War veteran. He got the GI bill and went on to get a college degree in law school. There I was with all these opportunities. Really, it was kind of the embodiment in the American dream. When the war broke out, I knew I was going to go into a trauma-related specialty, I felt this was an opportunity for me to give back, because I know a lot of the people that do a lot of the heavy lifting for our country in harm's way are people that were like my dad. I did that in 1991 … almost 35 years later, I am still involved in the MHS. It has been such a great career and a great mission.

Question: How does the MHS support the Department of Defense in achieving its goals and objectives?

Ferrara: What makes me so proud of the MHS is that we are a force multiplier for the warfighter. We improve and increase the lethality of the warfighter, and we do that through a number of ways. If you look at what our primary mission is—supporting the warfighter in combat—it is very empowering. It is a sacred pact we have with the warfighter that when they go into harm's way, should they become ill or injured, they can have the confidence of knowing they are going to get world-class health care immediately on the battlefield and have the best opportunity to return home healthy. That empowers the warfighter to be able to take the risks necessary and have that confidence to do those difficult missions and know that we are there backing them up. I think we have seen around the world recently; most other countries do not do that for their soldiers. We have seen that in battlefields in Europe and other places in the world. That is a real strategic edge that America has because we do that. It is expensive, it is complicated, but it is 100% aligned with American values.

Question: You recently toured military hospitals and clinics. What have you taken away from those visits, and do you plan to do any more in the future?

Ferrara: Town halls to me are a major priority, because I feel that having spent 25 years on active duty, I feel a very close kinship to the people that are doing the work at the military hospitals and clinics. I also understand a little bit about the size and scope of the MHS; it is a very large system. These visits help identify issues and improve morale. I want to show my appreciation and support for the workforce and let them know that their voice is heard, and their needs will be advocated for, and that they have a voice in the Pentagon.

It is always inspiring to me to see the people doing the work, because you see the folks in uniform, the ones that are 18-19-years old, all the way up through later parts of their career—and all our civilians and contracting partners who support us and their incredible ability to execute on the mission.

It is no secret that we are in challenging times, sometimes with resource limitations. There is a peace dividend, as the wars have ramped down, but the mission has not changed. [The] majority of our mission is taking care of dependents and retirees. That mission really stays the same. So, those folks must continue to execute on that mission, even when they do not necessarily have the resources that might come along with the resources that flow during wartime. They are a source of inspiration to me and helps energize me for my job. I am also able to find out about a lot of things that are going on—whether it is facilities issues, or whether it is processing issues that I would not otherwise know about—I can take back to my team for action.

The biggest takeaway is the inspiration I draw from it is the incredible morale. People are always there. They have been energetic, and they have been upbeat. They really are so mission focused, and it is a very virtuous cycle. I hope that by going to them, it helps them know that I really care about what they do. My team is working on getting to places across the whole spectrum, and not just focusing on large places, because it is good to get to small places throughout the country and overseas, because we are a complicated organization, and it is important to see them.

Question: What priorities have you set for the MHS to ensure that we are advancing the care provided to our beneficiaries?

Ferrara: My number one priority is supporting the warfighter. We are a Military Health System that goes to war, which makes us completely unique in America. We want to provide high-quality health care here in garrison, as any other top-performing health care system in America does, but we are the only ones that can go to war. I want to be keenly focused on, “are we ready to go to war?” I think we all understand that the next war will be a different battlefield landscape and medical care delivery landscape than prior wars. When I was in Afghanistan, we had 3-role-3 hospitals that were fixed facilities. We had the “golden hour.” We had air superiority. It was a difficult mission. We became really good at providing really good care.

I think if we pivot and we look at the threats in the Indo-Pacific, in that first island chain, it is much different in how it is distributed. It is a much more the tyranny of distance. I was a West Coast sailor for most of my life. I sailed from San Diego to Africa and back many times, and when you realize the ocean is 54% the surface of the Earth, the challenges of providing that health care and not having that golden hour. How do we provide prolonged field care? How do we have the people with the training, the platforms and infrastructure to be able to do that? That is my top priority.

What flows from what we do here on the continent in the MTFs—making sure that our folks always have a ready medical force so that people are getting the reps and sets they need to be able to continue to be ready to go at a moment's notice, and that they're at the top of their game. These are our force-generation platforms, and the military is a relatively young person's occupation. We can serve a full career and retire before you are 50 years old. We always have to be mindful of that. We are passing along the baton, and we are making sure that we are training that next generation. We do that through many platforms, a lot of that in our MTFs. Whether we are training surgical technologists to be able to support battlefield surgeries, whether we are training logisticians to learn how to order the supplies that are needed to enable medical teams to do what they need to do—all those kinds of things that we do so that we can succeed.

Question: Do you believe that aspect of the MHS makes us the most strong and innovative?

Ferrara: I think we are. We are certainly the strongest. We are the most resilient. I think that's part of our culture. When I joined, without a lot of forethought, I certainly did not envision that I would still be involved 35 years later. What makes this such a fulfilling and interesting type of career is we are always innovating, and it is never the same. We are not in status quo. We are doing things that are tackling new and difficult issues all the time and getting better at difficult missions.

We are looking hard at leveraging technology. How are those folks’ delivering health care in austere environments on the next battlefield? How are we going to equip them to succeed and to take great care of patients? I think we are looking to what can we do, looking at synchronous and asynchronous technologies to support them, either in the moment, remotely, or with tools they can have that are technology enabled to be able to do those things, and that is not a need in the private sector. That makes us a unique and a very exciting and interesting health care system, because we must be ready to deliver health care in any corner of the globe at any time.

One of the things that I am most proud of in the MHS, over a century and a half, a lot of the greatest innovations in medicine have come from military medicine. We continue that legacy. We sit on broad shoulders, but we know that we are not done. The next challenges will bring new innovations for us, and we try to speed ahead so that we are ready when we do.

Question: How do you see the ongoing budget discussions impacting the MHS?

Ferrara: I appreciate the question because it is important, and it is on a lot of people’s minds. I would like to start with the fact that it is my priority, as well as the administration’s, in delivering high-quality, safe health care. Supporting the warfighter will never be compromised.

I think it is also clear, and the American people understand this, there are a lot of opportunities for more efficiency across the federal government. I think as the largest department in the discretionary spending category, [DOD] would be remiss if we did not look at how we utilize the taxpayer dollar and make sure we are using it as well as we can. I think we are taking a very thoughtful approach to this. We are looking at all the areas where we spend money. We look at things where there are opportunities to leverage technology, to do things more efficiently, and with a better value. We are looking at things that are duplicative, where we could streamline, where other departments across government do some of the same functions and see if those things could be better allocated.

I think it is a process, and we are going to work through it and see where things fall when we take a zero-based budgeting approach to how we spend money—and that we will never compromise our ability to support warfighters when they go downrange. America's mothers and fathers put their children in harm’s way, and it is our solemn pact to make sure we take good care of them and money will not be an issue.

Question: What is the primary message you want to share with service members and military families as the Acting Assistant Secretary of Defense for Health Affairs?

Ferrara: The number one thing is—I am their voice. When I try to describe what the role of the Assistant Secretary of Defense for Health Affairs is, I do not know that I would have known that when I was early in my career. This role sits as the CEO of this large, complicated health care system, and be that person that is making the decisions on manpower, on how we resource our substantial budget, and how we utilize it most effectively. I represent the civilian leadership oversight of the military, which makes me be that conduit to the Secretary of Defense and to the White House and get what our folks need to be able to succeed. Their priorities are to make sure we are delivering the best health care to our not only our active duty, but our retired and dependent beneficiaries.

Question: What is the primary message that you want to share with the workforce serving around the world?

Ferrara: The first thing would be to extend my thanks. I have deployed four times, and I am a military spouse. My wife is still on active duty. She is deployed. When I sit down at dinner, we have 59 years in uniform and eight deployments. I know what people sacrifice. I missed a lot of birthdays, missed a lot of those things. There is a lot of sacrifice that goes into being part of the workforce and the MHS, but people do it, and they turn on a dime, and they do amazing things.

The most important thing I could say is to let them know that I appreciate what they do, I know what they do, and that I am trying to help them get what they need. I know people sometimes feel like you are a little bit … sort of isolated and alone, or you may not have a voice. We are a very large system, and I am trying to help make the system feel smaller to people, so that they do not feel as far removed, and so that that their voice is heard and that their voice does get transmitted. I think of health care as like an ecosystem where it takes everybody to build. It is not just the surgeon wielding the scalpel—which is the face they saw—but behind that surgeon is a huge cadre of people from logisticians, technologists, to nurses, to environmental services people, to facilities managers that are doing all those things to make sure that we were able to deliver.

There is a good military analogy … for a trigger-puller to do what he or she needs to do, the tail on that is immense so that they are fed, they are clothed, they are housed, they are warm, they have the ammunition they need, their weapon works. All those things so they can execute that mission, which is really the primary mission, relies on all those people. Health care is the same. There are a lot of things we are constantly doing to make sure that our people have great outcomes, and they should not have to worry, but they just know that when they go in, they trust us, and we reciprocate the trust by doing our work.",https://d1ldvf68ux039x.cloudfront.net/thumbs/photos/2503/8908843/1000w_q95.jpg,N,1.0,2025-03-11 14:53:48.554438

Medical monitoring for cases of communicable diseases such as Legionnaires’ disease is a public health measure that prevents larger-scale disease occurrence.
“In addition, most healthy people who are exposed to Legionella bacteria will not become ill with either Legionnaires’ disease or Pontiac fever.
Legionellosis comprises the illnesses (Legionnaires’ disease, Pontiac fever) caused by the Legionella bacteria.
However, Legionnaires’ disease shares many of the same risk factors as other pneumonias, so getting a pneumococcal vaccine, as well as a respiratory syncytial virus, or RSV, vaccine, as recommended, may reduce the risk of severe Legionnaires’ disease.","Legionnaires’ disease, a severe type of pneumonia, was so named in 1976 after a Pennsylvania outbreak of a mystery illness that sickened over 200 and killed 34 in two weeks. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention identified the cause of the illness to be a particular type of bacteria. Legionella bacteria were discovered in the cooling towers of a hotel that had been used for an American Legion convention.

“The risk of Legionnaires’ disease is lower now that scientists have learned more about its cause and effective prevention tactics,” says Dr. Charles McCannon, a preventive medicine physician working for Defense Health Agency-Public Health in Aberdeen, Maryland. “While the risk is low, cases still occur.”

Outbreaks occur when two or more people are exposed to Legionella in the same place and get sick at about the same time, says McCannon. The last outbreak confirmed by the military was in 2010 at Selfridge Air National Guard Base, Michigan.

Medical monitoring for cases of communicable diseases such as Legionnaires’ disease is a public health measure that prevents larger-scale disease occurrence.

Tracking Cases in the Military

To identify potential outbreaks and prevent additional exposures to the hazardous bacteria, both the CDC and the U.S. military require medical facilities to report cases of Legionnaires’ disease.

Alexis Maule, a senior epidemiologist with the Preventive Medicine Division of DHA-PH at Aberdeen, explains that the name Legionellosis is now used to refer to both Legionnaires’ disease and Pontiac fever, a milder illness without pneumonia.

“Most people with Pontiac fever likely do not seek treatment for their illness,” says Maule. “In addition, most healthy people who are exposed to Legionella bacteria will not become ill with either Legionnaires’ disease or Pontiac fever. That means the extent of exposure may underreported, but we are identifying cases needing treatment at military medical facilities.”

Even with the expanded case definition, the military has not found Legionellosis to be a commonly reported disease. This is generally consistent with CDC findings though there are higher rates in the general population.

“In the past five years, 87 Legionellosis cases have been reported to the military’s medical reporting system, and only half of these were confirmed to be Legionnaires’ disease,” says Maule. “In addition, the disease was most frequently reported in retirees, while less than a third of reported cases were active-duty military personnel.”

Maule explains that this makes sense because age is risk factor for Legionellosis, and many retirees were noted to already have chronic medical conditions unrelated to Legionellosis, making this group more susceptible to any type of bacterial infection.

McCannon and Maule provide answers to questions about Legionellosis:

Frequently Asked Questions

Q. What is Legionellosis?

Legionellosis comprises the illnesses (Legionnaires’ disease, Pontiac fever) caused by the Legionella bacteria. Many species of Legionella bacteria can cause disease, but the presence of the bacteria in the environment or even in a clinical sample (such as urine or blood) does not mean a person is or will become ill with a disease. The majority of disease is caused by Legionella pneumophila, particularly a sub type known as serogroup 1.

Because the bacteria have the potential to cause harm (even if no clinical cases are reported), the presence of Legionella bacteria detected in a facility is considered a hazard to be remediated. Protocols have been established to ensure proper sanitation is achieved.

Q. How does a person get sick with Legionnaires’ disease?

The primary way people are exposed is by breathing in water droplets that carry the Legionella bacteria. Less commonly, Legionella may be transmitted via aspiration of drinking water. Exposed persons who become sick do not transmit the infection to others.

While Legionella bacteria occur naturally in freshwater environments, they primarily cause disease after growing in certain human-made water systems that aerosolize water. Complex air conditioning cooling towers of large structures such as hotels, hospitals, long-term care facilities, and cruise ships are a particular concern. Water systems and air-conditioning units of private homes are generally not exposure sources. Cases have occasionally been attributed to personal hot tubs, whirlpool spas and even decorative fountains.

The CDC reports that since the 1976 outbreak, agencies around the world now have more stringent cleaning and hygiene standards for cooling towers and large-scale air-conditioning systems. But the conditions outside the U.S. may present more of a concern.

Q. What are symptoms of Legionellosis?

Legionellosis symptoms can include fever and other flu-like symptoms such as muscle aches and cough and can begin hours to several days after bacteria are inhaled. Legionnaires’ disease symptoms begin two to 14 days after exposure and can be confirmed when Legionella bacteria infect cells in the air sacs of the lung. This condition can be life-threatening, but it is treatable with antibiotics.

The symptoms of Pontiac fever develop in five hours to a few days; it is a milder illness—without pneumonia—characterized by dry cough or sore throat, fever, chills, fatigue, headache and sore muscles.

Q. How is Legionellosis diagnosed?

Diagnosis is based on clinical findings, such as signs of pneumonia identified with a chest x-ray, and medical laboratory antigen confirmation of the unique type of the bacteria, known as serotype in the patient. If environmental samples are available, they can be compared to the bacteria type found in patient samples. If the bacteria type does not match the type found at an environmental source of concern, other exposure sources are considered.

Q. Are certain people at higher risk of Legionellosis?

Most healthy people who are exposed to Legionella bacteria do not get infected with disease. Certain behaviors such as smoking, recent travel with an overnight stay outside of the home, recent care at a healthcare facility, and hot tub use are risk factors that would be considered if determining a case.

The risk of Legionellosis is higher among persons over 50 and those with chronic lung disease, immune system disorders due to disease or medication, systemic malignancy, or an underlying illness such as diabetes, renal failure, or hepatic failure. The younger, relatively healthy and vaccinated active-duty population has a lower risk for severe disease from Legionella exposure compared to the general population.

Q. Does risk of Legionellosis depend on location or time?

Within the U.S., the CDC has shown a higher number of cases of Legionellosis in the northern and mid-western states. There is some seasonality to the risk of Legionellosis, with higher risk of infection in the summer through fall months because temperate conditions allow for the growth of the bacteria.

Q. How is Legionellosis differentiated from other pneumonias?

Pneumonia is a generalized term for inflammation and infection of the air sacs in one or both lungs resulting in fluid in the lungs. Air sacs fill with fluid or pus, causing a productive cough with phlegm, and often fever, chills and difficulty breathing.

Pneumonia can be a symptom of many different diseases and can be caused by a range of organisms, including bacteria (such as Legionnaires’ disease and Q fever), viruses (such as COVID-19 and certain flu viruses), and fungi (such as Coccidioidomycosis [“Valley fever”]). The severity of pneumonia infection can range from mild to life-threatening. Bacterial pneumonia is usually more severe than viral pneumonia.

Pneumonia caused by Legionella bacteria is only differentiated from other pneumonias by medical tests/laboratory tests to determine the cause of the pneumonia.

Q. Does the pneumonia vaccine help against Legionellosis?

There is no vaccine against Legionellosis, and none of the available pneumococcal vaccines protect against the Legionella bacteria. However, Legionnaires’ disease shares many of the same risk factors as other pneumonias, so getting a pneumococcal vaccine, as well as a respiratory syncytial virus, or RSV, vaccine, as recommended, may reduce the risk of severe Legionnaires’ disease.

While some might wonder why this information is necessary, the answer is clear—it benefits both patients and the Military Health System.

The Military Health System provides care to service members, retirees, and their families, but it is also designed to work in conjunction with private insurance companies. When a patient has Other Health Insurance (OHI), such as a civilian employer’s health plan or private insurance, benefits can be coordinated to ensure costs are appropriately distributed.

By billing private insurance providers, the uniform business office recoups funds that are reinvested into patient care, facility improvements, and medical readiness. In fiscal year 2024 alone, the UBO team at Bassett Army Community Hospital recovered over $1.8 million and are on track to bring in approximately $2 million this year.

According to Ivy, this income helps our patients here locally.

“Money brought into MEDDAC-AK through OHI benefits Bassett and our outlying clinics across the state by putting that money back into our budget,” said Tyra Ivy, Chief of UBO at MEDDAC-AK. “Ultimately the income we bring in goes back into providing care to our patients.""

OHI Benefits

Disclosing OHI does not increase out-of-pocket expenses for patients. Instead, it ensures the private insurance plan pays its share of medical costs, which helps sustain military healthcare resources.

For patients, using OHI can also result in long-term savings.

“UBO does not bill TRICARE beneficiaries, and when they use their OHI, it helps them to meet their deductible, which may save them money, if they are referred off post,” Ivy explained.

Additionally, accurate OHI information helps prevent billing errors and claim denials. When providers have up-to-date insurance details, claims are processed correctly, reducing administrative delays and potential out-of-pocket costs for patients.

Your Role in Keeping Records Accurate

To ensure the system works efficiently, beneficiaries should:

• Provide their OHI information/VA Coverage at every visit.

• Report any changes in insurance coverage to the military treatment facility and TRICARE.

• If utilizing VA benefits ensure authorization is complete and verify at check in.

“Patients provide their OHI by filling out form DD2569 annually and updating the information when checking in for appointments,” Ivy said. ""While it is an annual requirement, we encourage patients to let us know any time they have changes to their OHI.""

Working Together for a Stronger System

MEDDAC-AK is committed to providing world-class care to those who serve and their families. By sharing OHI information, patients play a vital role in supporting military healthcare operations, improving resources, and ensuring fiscal responsibility within the system.

The next time you check in for an appointment, take a moment to verify your insurance details. It’s a small step that makes a big impact—for you, for the military community, and for the future of military medicine.

Recognizing this, TRICARE covers many substance abuse treatments, including drug and alcohol rehab and alcohol detox. Knowing what's covered is key for veterans to get back to health and well-being.

In this article for Start Motion Media, we will cover if TRICARE covers alcohol detox, what services are included and how to get treatment. We will also go over how to navigate the system so detox services are fully covered.

Health Coverage for Alcohol Detox

TRICARE is a health insurance program for active-duty service members, retirees and their families. It covers mental health and substance use disorder (SUD) treatment which includes alcohol detox. But coverage varies depending on the veteran's TRICARE plan, the facility's network status and medical necessity.

What Type of Alcohol Detox Does TRICARE Cover?

TRICARE generally covers both inpatient and outpatient detox when medically necessary.

Inpatient Detox: This is for individuals who need 24/7 medical supervision to manage withdrawal symptoms safely. Veterans with severe withdrawal or co-occurring disorders may need inpatient care.

Outpatient Detox: This is for individuals with milder withdrawal symptoms and a stable home environment. Treatment includes medication-assisted therapy (MAT), counseling and regular medical supervision.

VA Health Care and Addiction Treatment

VA health care covers comprehensive addiction treatment including substance use disorder treatment and mental health services. Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) offers a range of services to address substance use disorders and co-occurring mental health conditions.

Veterans can get addiction treatment services through their local VA medical center or clinic or through vet Centers. VA also offers evidence-based treatment for substance use disorder including therapies, medication or both.

Find Veteran Detox Centers at Your Local VA Medical Center

Veterans seeking alcohol detox services should start by making sure the facility they choose is TRICARE-approved. Many treatment programs across the country accept TRICARE so it's easy to find good care. Finding TRICARE detox centers nationwide will help veterans connect with the right facility for them.

TRICARE divides healthcare providers into network and non-network facilities:

Network providers have agreements with TRICARE so out-of-pocket costs are lower. Non-network providers may still accept TRICARE but may require higher co-pays or extra paperwork for approval.

How to Get Detox Covered by VA Health Benefits as a Veteran

Navigating TRICARE's coverage can be overwhelming but knowing the steps can make it easier. Here's how veterans can get detox covered by insurance as a veteran:

Confirm Eligibility: TRICARE coverage depends on the veteran's specific health insurance plan. TRICARE Prime, Select and Reserve Select have different levels of coverage for detox services.

Get a Referral or Pre-Authorization: Some detox programs require a referral from a TRICARE-authorized provider. Check with TRICARE or the treatment facility to confirm requirements.

Choose a Covered Facility: Select a treatment center within TRICARE's network to maximize benefits and minimize out-of-pocket costs.

Understand Co-Pays and Costs: Depending on the TRICARE plan there may be no out-of-pocket costs for detox services.

Seek Continued Care: Detox is the first step in long-term recovery. TRICARE also covers follow-up services such as inpatient rehabilitation, outpatient counseling and medication-assisted treatment (MAT).

Using VA Health Benefits for Private Rehab

Veterans can use their VA health benefits to pay for private addiction treatment. VA allows veterans to supplement their VA benefits with other insurance plans such as private health insurance, Medicare, Medicaid or TRICARE.

Veterans should inform their addiction treatment provider about their multiple insurance coverages and VA will bill the supplemental health insurance provider first. Payments received from other insurance providers can offset some or all of the VA copay costs.

Additional Health Benefits for Substance Use Disorder Treatment

Choosing the right treatment program is key to long-term recovery. Beyond detox TRICARE covers:

Residential rehabilitation programs for veterans who need structured long-term treatment.

Partial hospitalization programs (PHPs) that provide intensive daytime treatment while allowing individuals to go home at night.

Intensive outpatient programs (IOPs) for veterans who need structured therapy but can still maintain daily responsibilities.

Medication-assisted treatment (MAT) to manage withdrawal symptoms and reduce cravings.

Individual and group therapy sessions to address underlying mental health issues related to addiction.

Your Rights and VA Health-Covered Rehab

Veterans have the right to confidentiality when seeking addiction treatment through VA health care. However, there may be some limitations to this right such as the Military Command Exception which allows for disclosure of treatment information to Command officers in certain circumstances.

Veterans should understand their rights and the limitations of confidentiality when seeking addiction treatment through VA health care.

Barriers to Treatment and How to Overcome Them

While TRICARE covers detox and other substance use treatments some veterans may face barriers to care. Common challenges include:

Lack of Awareness: Many veterans are not aware TRICARE covers alcohol detox.

Bureaucratic Challenges: Navigating the healthcare system can be complicated especially when referrals or pre-authorizations are required.

Stigma Surrounding Addiction: Some veterans may not seek help due to the stigma of substance use disorders.

To overcome these barriers:

Educate Yourself: Understanding TRICARE benefits can empower veterans to seek the care they need.

Reach Out for Help: Veteran support organizations and TRICARE representatives can help.

Advocate for Your Health: Be proactive in seeking care and understanding treatment options.

Navigating VA Health Benefits with Support

Veterans can navigate their VA health benefits with support from their primary care provider at the VA. Advocating for oneself by telling the VA provider you want to see a community care provider can be a big step.

Tricare Rehabs can help veterans navigate the process and understand what steps are needed to get authorized for care. Our veteran advocates are trained to help veterans understand VA health benefits and the process of getting care.

Payment Options and Financing for Veteran Rehab

Veterans have several payment options and financing options for rehab. VA health benefits can cover the cost of addiction treatment and veterans can also use their VA benefits to supplement other insurance plans.

VA has various financing options including copays and deductibles and veterans can also look into private financing options such as loans or credit cards. Veterans should discuss payment options and financing options with their addiction treatment provider to determine the best course of action.

My daughter was born December 5th, and we received a letter in the mail from the hospital saying that we owed 8k. When I called the hospital, they informed me that tricare (hnfs due to the claim being submitted prior to January 1st) denied the claim due to my daughter not meeting the requirements of being my dependent. I'm assuming this was due to her not yet being in DEERS, but I don't even know how to get ahold of HNFS to get the claim reprocessed.

I sat listening to their hold music for 3 hours and 15 minutes tonight. I hung up because I didn't realize that they closed at 9pm PT and not 9pm CST. There has to be a better way to get ahold of them than waiting on hold for a whole day.

Any advice is welcome
