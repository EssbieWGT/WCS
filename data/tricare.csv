TRICARE Select is a fee-for-service health plan available to eligible members of the military community, including active-duty family members, retired service members, and their families.

Unlike TRICARE Prime which is a managed care model, TRICARE Select allows beneficiaries to choose their healthcare providers without referrals. This flexibility can be helpful when choosing a rehab center that meets your needs. TRICARE insurance has several plans, including TRICARE Select, each with different benefits and coverage options.

When choosing a rehab facility it’s important to know the different types of treatment centers TRICARE Select covers. These include:

1. Inpatient Rehab Centers

Inpatient treatment or residential rehab centers provide intensive, around-the-clock care in a structured environment. These programs are best for individuals with severe addictions who need medical supervision and support. TRICARE Select typically covers inpatient stays but pre-authorization may be required.

2. Outpatient Rehab Centers

Outpatient treatment allows you to receive care while living at home, making it a good option for those with mild to moderate substance use disorders. Services may include individual and group therapy, medication management, and relapse prevention planning.

TRICARE Select covers both inpatient and outpatient rehab services, so flexibility is based on the severity of the addiction.

3. Partial Hospitalization Programs (PHPs)

PHPs provide a high level of care without full-time residential treatment. Patients attend treatment for several hours a day and return home in the evenings. TRICARE Select often covers PHPs as an alternative to inpatient rehab.

4. Intensive Outpatient Programs (IOPs)

IOPs offer a structured treatment approach with multiple therapy sessions a week but more flexibility than inpatient or PHP treatment. These programs are good for individuals transitioning from a higher level of care or those with moderate addiction concerns.

5. Detox Centers

Medically supervised detox for alcohol and drugs is the first step in addiction recovery, especially for substances that cause severe withdrawal symptoms.

TRICARE Select may cover detox services if they are done at a TRICARE-authorized facility.

1. Verify TRICARE Authorization

Authorized facilities meet the necessary standards for quality care and accept TRICARE coverage. To make sure the rehab center is TRICARE authorized, speak with a TRICARE Rehabs representative. We can help you find a TRICARE-approved facility that is covered under your plan.

2. Understand Costs and Coverage Limits

While TRICARE Select covers many rehab services, you may still have out-of-pocket costs such as copayments or cost-shares. Be sure to confirm financial responsibilities before starting treatment.

3. Consider Location and Specialization

Choose a facility that meets your needs. Some centers specialize in treating veterans while others offer dual diagnosis treatment for co-occurring mental health disorders.

4. Get Recommendations

Talk to a TRICARE Rehabs representative to get guidance on choosing the right rehab center to get treatment. We are experts on military-specific addiction treatment, and work with an extensive network of veterans rehab facilities across the nation that cater military members and their families.

What to Expect in a TRICARE Select Rehab Program

The rehab experience varies based on the level of care and individual needs but most programs follow a structured treatment plan that includes:

1. Assessment and Intake

A comprehensive evaluation to determine the best treatment plan. This may include medical assessments, psychological evaluations, and substance use history.

2. Detox (if needed)

Medically supervised detox to ensure a safe withdrawal process and prepare individuals for the next phase of treatment.

3. Therapy and Counseling

Evidence-based therapies such as cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT), dialectical behavior therapy (DBT), and trauma-informed care are often included in treatment plans. This is due to how common mental health issues are amongst military personnel and veterans.

4. Medication-Assisted Treatment (MAT)

For those struggling with opioid or alcohol addiction, MAT may be prescribed to ease withdrawal symptoms and reduce cravings.

5. Aftercare and Relapse Prevention

Successful recovery from drug and alcohol addiction requires ongoing support such as 12-step programs, outpatient therapy, and sober living arrangements.

Getting treatment for substance use disorder is a big step and TRICARE Select health insurance makes it available to military families. Knowing the coverage, choosing the right rehab and committing to the process can mean a healthier, addiction free life.

If you or a loved one need help, start today by reaching out to a TRICARE Rehabs representative. We can help you understand your rehab options and find in-network facilities that can provide the support you need.

TRICARE East Rehab FAQs

1. Does TRICARE East Cover Long-Term Rehab?

Yes, but length of stay must be deemed medically necessary. Coverage for long-term treatment is reviewed on a case-by-case basis.

2. Are There Any Out-of-Pocket Costs?

Costs depend on your TRICARE plan. Active duty service members may have no out-of-pocket costs while retirees and dependents may have copayments.

Veterans may be eligible for treatment through VA health benefits rather than TRICARE insurance. However, certain veterans and medically retired personnel can still access TRICARE rehab services.

4. Is Family Therapy Covered?

Yes, family therapy and support programs are covered because addiction affects not only the individual but their loved ones as well.

Visit TRICARE’s Retired Service Members and Their Families page for up-to-date information, resources, and to check your eligibility or enrollment status.","Retiring from military service is a big transition in many ways – one of those ways is how healthcare is provided to the service member and their family members. TRICARE offers several health insurance options for retired service members and their eligible family members. Understanding these options is key to making the best choices for your healthcare needs during retirement.

Who’s Eligible?

If you’re a retired service member, you’re eligible for TRICARE benefits if you fall into one of these categories:

You retired from active duty.

You retired from the National Guard or Reserve (beginning at age 60 or earlier if drawing retirement pay due to specific service credits).

You’re placed on the Temporary Disability Retirement List (TDRL) or Permanent Disability Retirement List (PDRL).

You’re receiving retired pay, even if it’s due to a medical retirement.

Eligible Family Members Include:

Spouses

Unmarried children (up to age 21, or 23 if enrolled in college full time)

Adult children with disabilities that occurred before age 21 (or 23 if in college)

TRICARE Plan Options for Retirees

Once you retire, your TRICARE options change from what you had on active duty. Here’s a breakdown of the available plans:

1. TRICARE Prime

Who Can Enroll: Retired service members and eligible family members in Prime Service Areas (PSAs) in the U.S.

Cost: Enrollment fees apply, and there may be copayments for certain services.

How It Works: You have a Primary Care Manager (PCM) who coordinates your care and referrals. It’s similar to an HMO. If your family was enrolled in TRICARE Prime during active service, or you were a service member receiving care at a Military Treatment Facility (MTF), this is the same process.

2. TRICARE Select

Who Can Enroll: Retirees and families worldwide (where TRICARE Select is offered).

Cost: Annual enrollment fees and cost-shares (percentage of covered services you pay). No referrals needed, but some services require prior authorization.

How It Works: You manage your own health care. You can see any TRICARE-authorized provider without a referral.

3. TRICARE For Life (TFL)

Who Can Enroll: Retirees and their family members who are eligible for Medicare Part A and have Medicare Part B.

Cost: No enrollment fee, but you must pay for Medicare Part B. TFL acts as a secondary payer to Medicare.

How It Works: Available worldwide. Medicare pays first in the U.S., and TFL pays what’s left. Outside the U.S., TFL is the primary payer.

4. TRICARE Reserve Select (TRS) / TRICARE Retired Reserve (TRR)

TRS: For actively serving National Guard/Reserve members (not retirees).

TRR: For “gray area” retirees—those under age 60 not yet drawing retired pay. It’s a premium-based plan.

5. US Family Health Plan (USFHP)

Who Can Enroll: Retirees and family members under age 65 in specific areas of the U.S.

Cost: Enrollment fees and copayments, similar to TRICARE Prime.

How It Works: Care is provided by a network of private providers. Once you turn 65 and become eligible for Medicare, you can no longer stay in this plan.

Dental and Vision Coverage

TRICARE Dental Program (TDP)

Not available to retirees.

Retirees can enroll in the Federal Employees Dental and Vision Insurance Program (FEDVIP) for dental coverage.

Vision Coverage

Retirees enrolled in a TRICARE health plan can also get vision coverage through FEDVIP.

What Changes at Age 65?

At age 65, you typically become eligible for Medicare Part A and Part B, and TRICARE For Life becomes your primary TRICARE coverage. You must enroll in Medicare Part B to keep TRICARE coverage.

Key Takeaways

Enrollment Fees & Costs: Retirees pay enrollment fees and cost-shares, unlike active-duty members. These fees change annually.

Open Season: Annual TRICARE Open Season runs from mid-November to mid-December, allowing you to enroll in or switch plans.

When people have insurance that covers therapy, psychiatry, and other mental health services, they’re more likely to seek help when needed rather than delaying care due to financial concerns. TRICARE mental health coverage is crucial for military service members since early intervention often leads to better outcomes and prevents conditions from worsening to the point where they require more intensive and expensive treatments.

Mental health insurance in Los Angeles also reduces the financial burden that can come with ongoing mental health care, which sometimes requires months or years of consistent treatment. When mental health conditions are properly treated, there are significant reductions in lost productivity, decreased emergency room visits, lower hospitalization rates, and fewer disability claims.

The average delay between onset of mental illness symptoms and treatment is 11 years, according to the National Alliance on Mental Illness. As access to treatment and insurance coverage expands, the percentage of adults who have received any mental health treatment has increased in recent years. This article will further explore the benefits of how insurance increases access to mental services and how to ensure every patient can receive affordable treatment for mental health.

How Do TRICARE’s Mental Health Benefits Compare to Other Insurance Plans?

TRICARE’s mental health coverage generally offers comprehensive benefits comparable to or better than many private insurance plans. Active duty service members receive full coverage with minimal out-of-pocket costs for authorized care, while family members and retirees have access to a broad network of providers with reasonable copays.

TRICARE is particularly strong in its coverage of various treatment modalities, including individual therapy, group therapy, inpatient care, partial hospitalization programs, and medication management. Another notable advantage is TRICARE’s integration with military treatment facilities, which can provide seamless care coordination between physical and mental health services, which civilian plans often struggle to achieve.

However, TRICARE does face some limitations compared to certain premium private insurance plans. Network availability can be challenging in remote locations, sometimes requiring beneficiaries to travel significant distances for specialized mental health care. While TRICARE has expanded its telehealth options, some premium commercial plans offer more extensive virtual mental health platforms with broader provider networks and specialized digital therapeutic tools.

Insurance verification for mental health treatment and referral requirements can also be more stringent under TRICARE, particularly for active duty members, creating potential administrative barriers to care that some civilian plans have eliminated. Despite these differences, TRICARE remains a valuable and robust mental health benefit that continues to evolve to meet the unique needs of the military community.",https://momentofclarity.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/tricare-mental-health-coverage.jpg,N,0.0,2025-03-17 17:50:49.574543

The project presentation was based upon such criteria as innovative/creativity and overall impact on quality of care, patient safety and operational readiness.

“By continuously evaluating and refining our processes, we can reduce inefficiencies allowing more time for patient care and more time to utilize/improve the knowledge, skills, and abilities that make us a ready medical force,” said Lt. Cmdr. Ashley Gripe, Navy Medicine Readiness Training Unit Everett Physical Therapy Department head and Process Improvement Sciences lead. “By always looking at ways to improve, we are better able to provide the safe and quality healthcare that our service members need to ensure a medially ready force.”

The ‘Continuous Process Improvement’ concept is based upon the DHA Ready Reliable Care principle, which is focused on reducing unwarranted variation across the system, eliminating waste, and lowering costs.

“We recognize that Continuous Process Improvement is critical to what we do in Navy Medicine and in the fleet. By constantly analyzing and refining processes, we can adapt to changing demands, increase our patient satisfaction, and optimize our resource utilization,” Gripe said.

“This CPI Fair gives us an opportunity to highlight initiatives around the command,” continued Gripe. “Staff can demonstrate the improvements they are making to advance patient quality and safety. It helps to encourage a culture of High Reliability and Continuous Process Improvement that we strive for every day.

CPI initiatives included such ideas as implementing clinical improvements; developing strategic clinical partnerships; and improving and refining administrative and support processes.

“The submissions this year included projects from throughout the command including submissions from our branch clinics. They show the innovation and creativity that our staff utilizes every day to improve the care of our beneficiaries. The submissions demonstrated an impact on safety, quality, and readiness with controls to make sure they are able to sustain the benefits over time,” explained Gripe. “Some of the best ideas come from our civilian staff and corpsmen working day in and day out on the deck plates.”

Each of the 15 submissions presented a process to be improved, measurement on the improved process, analysis which tested any change(s) implemented, and more.

Navy Medicine Readiness Training Unit Everett Pharmacy presented their submission of ‘Pharmacy Designated Service Hours,’ how increased patient wait times can occur when pharmacy staff helping patients are pulled to perform other necessary tasks. Their goal indicated to create designated service hours to increase efficiency and reduce patient wait time by allowing pharmacy tasks to be done prior to assisting patients. Project lead was Lt. Julianne Hui, with team members Hospital Corpsman 2nd Class Brian Matthews, Hospital Corpsmen 3rd Class Isabelle Doyle and Micheala Martinez, Dr. Audra McCoy, Dr. Kathy Scott, Sonny Wilson, and Latoya Hall.

NMRTU Everett Laboratory submitted their ‘Lab Order Reference Guide’ presentation, with project lead HM2 Alessandra Vera explaining to the judging panel led by Capt. Kala Lepore, Naval Hospital Bremerton director and Navy Medicine Readiness Training Command Bremerton commanding officer, that ship providers homeported at Naval Station Everett were encountering challenges when they tried to place lab orders. Vera and her team members of HM2 Moncho Cabahug, HM2 Caleb MartinezSewell and Ms. Jezieca Cachero devised their project around distributing a lab order reference guide – with regular updates – to all providers on the waterfront to ensure a seamless and efficient ordering process for lab work.

After Hospitalman Olivia Blader Polzin of NHB’s Patient Administration noticed that there was unknown supply inventory with several departments which caused delays and missed items, she took it upon herself to develop an Excel spreadsheet to keep accurate records to minimize deficiencies, streamline ordering of actual needed supplies and increase productivity between the departments.

NHB’s Information Management Department had a vexing problem which they rectified as presented in ‘Asset Refresh,’ led by project leads Lt. j.g. David Tegtmeyer and Electronics Technician 1st Class Adam Phelps, ably assisted by all IMD staff members. They had approximately 800 pieces of equipment which had to be timely updated to meet the stringent requirements. Each item took nearly four hours to upgrade as required.

NHB’s Radiology Department presented their project, entitled “MOU for CT Training.’ The department has had CT imaging challenges due to manning challenges, caused by transfer and retirement. The department has proposed establishing a memorandum of understanding with local civilian hospital, St. Michael Medical Center, to authorize NHB radiologic technologists to obtain added training for CT, as well as other modalities such as MRI, ultrasound and mammography.

Lt. Essie Gutierrez represented the Directorate of Health Services Specialty Care Clinic presentation, ‘Utilization of Electronic Colonoscopy Teaching Video,’ which called for streamlining the delivery process of patient education instructions for colonoscopy teaching.

The Neurology Clinic, with project leads Lt. Cmdr. Margaret Mitzkewich and Lt. Justin Roelofs and team members Hospital Corpsman 1st Class William Brown and HM2 Kyle Champion, determined that they were retrieving approximately 16 vials per week of Botulinum from the inpatient pharmacy. Not a difficult task, but time consuming. Due to the constant need for refrigeration and inability to pick up in bulk, there was the continuous need to only pick up one order at a time. Until a properly suited refrigerator was identified and relocated in the clinic.

The Ophthalmology Department presented their ‘Ocular Triage and Challenges of Standardization’ submission, noting they had determined there was a lack of accurate ophthalmic triaging at the initial point of care, resulting in deferred patient referral and delays in care. Their goal was to standardize the triage process with initial [patient] presentation at primary and urgent care clinics, reduce time delays for urgent and emergent ophthalmology cases and reduce potential patient harm through delays in reporting for care. Project lead was Lt. Cmdr. Lan Nguyen assisted by team member HM2 Quinniece Mosley.

‘Project Pulmonary Expansion’ was presented by the Pulmonary Clinic with project lead HM1 Joseph Towery explaining that the clinic is not generating [enough] encounters relevant to patient populations and referrals. In order to improve access to care for all respiratory therapy patients within the service area and lower the task load of primary care, the clinic restructured referral management template to provide NHB as the top source for appointments by bringing back patients previously sent for care into the surrounding network and Madigan Army Medical Center.

Improving time management was key the ‘RFID Implementation in the Clinic Setting’ presentation by Family Medicine, led by project lead Lt. j.g. Maryn Holtslander and team members Lt. Hana Reichert and Hospitalman Gillian Searfoss. Their premise indicated a delay when transferring intake [information] from paper to the DoD’s electronic health record, MHS GENESIS, instead of directly documenting during the initial intake process. Eliminating the need for paper charting provides a number of time-saving advantages, especially giving the provider added triage time with the patient.

The Family Medicine presentation ‘On the Lookout’ used HEDIS (Healthcare Effectiveness Data and Information Set) to help identify patients due – or overdue – for preventive medicine measures such as colorectal screenings and mammograms, as well as address other delinquent measures including immunizations. The goal, established by project lead Terri Jandron, registered nurse, with team members registered nurses Ramir Salcedo, Farrah Palad and Devry Cmelo, Lt. Mikala Tracy, Lt. Christopher Gunderson, Lt. Olivia Cook, and Reichert, Lt. j.g. Wanda Burdick, Lt. j.g. Halle Hassett, and Holtslander, was to ensure providers and support staff are aware of screening needs and added orders placed while patients are present for scheduled appointments which can increase the number of patients completing their preventive health needs.

‘Teams Communication’ was the submission from Primary Care, with project lead Dr. Brandi Hommel and Reichert, aided by Family Medicine staff as team members. Their problem statement indicated challenges in communication amongst staff members was spreading in the clinic, specifically relating appointment delays between administrative receptionists and clinic support staff. They implemented the process of using Teams chat for all; nursing and support staff to help improve easier – and timely – communication.

NHB’s Informatics Steering Committee, charged with planning and implementing strategic informational technology initiatives, determined that the command did not have appointed peer experts for clinical areas, a Defense Health Agency requirement for all military treatment facilities. Their ‘Peer Expert Program,’ was led by project lead Reichert and team members Kelly Gann, Chris Rona, Kristina Sainz, Gunderson and Cmdr. J. M. Patton. A standardized program format was developed and peer experts within two clinical areas were put in place on a trial basis to determine knowledge and confidence with MHS GENESIS.

‘Utilizing Auto-Text’ from Family Medicine’s Primary Care Clinic, led by project lead HM3 Adam Redman and Holtslander, with team members Reichert and HN Anfernee Coleman, realized that their clinic relied upon in-between encounters with MHS GENESIS to communicate information regarding patient requests and staff member needs. There were times some information would be omitted, and written messages were a time-consuming process. The project goal was to streamline routine tasks through automation by implementing a standardized approach for all users.

The Family Medicine Clinic presented the ‘Purple Paper Project,’ stating that obstetrics referrals from their clinic to OB/GYN could be delayed due to a non-standardized process for ordering, verifying test results and timely entering appropriate referrals for network care.

Their goal is to create a standardized format for patients enrolled in the clinic, as well as those who present in NHB’s Urgent Care Clinic and request a pregnancy test. Project lead was Hassett, with team members Tracy, Reichert, Cook, Gunderson, Holtslander, Burdick, Salcedo, Palad and Cmelo.

Gripe attests that the benefits of encouraging such innovation and creativity in military medicine are manifold.

“Both our beneficiaries and our staff benefit from us sharing our process improvement ideas. The benefit however is not limited just to here. After the CPI Fair we will enter these projects into the Strategic Performance Improvement Data Repository which makes these improvement ideas available to all Department of Defense and the Defense Health Agency entities. The improvements that we make here has the potential to impact staff and patients across the world,” stated Gripe.",https://d1ldvf68ux039x.cloudfront.net/thumbs/photos/2503/8919769/1000w_q95.jpg,N,0.0,2025-03-17 12:50:35.328372

He refuses to have a medicare online account so he can't check and has to go by what the medical facility says and he gets in the mail. I guess the facility isn't very prompt.

A number of my clients never access their MyMedicare account even though I tell them how to set it up and access it.

When a client asks why their claim was not paid I ask about the information from MyMedicare . . . they can't say.

I tell them THEY need to send me the MSN (which may not come in until months later, or go to their MyMedicare account and get the claim summary or call Medicare and ASK for the claim summary to be sent to them.

If a claim is not paid by Medicare there is a code attached to the denial. If the procedure is not covered, and they have not signed an ABN form, they aren't responsible for paying it.

I constantly drill into them, to never pay a claim until AFTER Medicare has adjudicated it.

But yet, many times they pay the first claim that comes in from the provider.

A few years ago Rachel got an outpatient claim from the hospital for $20k. The provider coded the claim correctly but someone at the hospital keyed in a code that was off by one digit. This caused the claim to be adjudicated as NC vs approved.

The provider called the hospital, explained the coding discrepancy, and the claim was paid in full (remaining 20% covered by the Medigap).

On another situation, Rachel had OP consult in Dec 2024 followed by surgery in January. The first bill we got was in early March for $14,000. The bill was never submitted to Medicare, they were billing us as ""self pay, no insurance"". After they submitted it to Medicare we owed $87 (the Part B deductible).

In the Army and Air Force, nearly 1,400 more soldiers and airmen work as surgical technicians.
“Some of the surgical techs here can be [asked] to serve in Djibouti or tasked out to certain hospitals that are critically undermanned.
“We are the fastest turnaround for refractive surgeries,” Mosley said.
Mosley’s duties include ordering specialty implants for surgeries, managing supplies and equipment, and overseeing other ophthalmology surgical techs and hospital corpsmen.","MARCH 16, 2025 – Peace through strength — one of the Defense Department’s basic tenets — is partially achieved through readiness. A ready, focused force isn’t possible without the crucial medical care offered to warfighters to ensure they’re equipped for any fight that might come.

Navy hospital corpsmen are critical components of military medicine, including as support for surgeons in various specialties. Corpsmen with the surgical tech specialty are considered the backbone of the departments in which they work, helping the Navy as it provides day-to-day medical support to sailors who often operate in far-flung locations.

According to a draft of the Medical Transparency Database from the Defense Health Agency, as of September 2024, there were about 830 hospital corpsmen with the surgical tech specialty in the Navy. In the Army and Air Force, nearly 1,400 more soldiers and airmen work as surgical technicians.

From assisting during surgeries to properly carrying out disinfection and sterilization processes, surgical techs are vital in fields ranging from dentistry and ear, nose and throat services to labor and delivery and ophthalmology. They go where they’re needed, whether it’s on a trauma team near a combat zone, on a humanitarian mission or at a military medical treatment facility.

“Some of the surgical techs here can be [asked] to serve in Djibouti or tasked out to certain hospitals that are critically undermanned. There’s a wide range of opportunities,” said Navy Petty Officer 2nd Class Quinn Mosley, the lead hospital corpsman and certified surgical technician at Naval Hospital Bremerton’s Ophthalmology Clinic and Refractive Surgery Center, Bremerton, Washington.

In 2023, Bremerton’s ophthalmology clinic handled more than 4,400 appointments for active-duty service members and other uniformed personnel. The refractive surgery center, which does corrective surgeries such as LASIK, brings in patients from across the Indo-Pacific, a region where the DOD is working to strengthen alliances against ever-increasing threats from China.

“We are the fastest turnaround for refractive surgeries,” Mosley said. “You will be seen 10 times faster [here than] anywhere else in the Navy.”

Improving Operational Readiness

Bremerton’s ophthalmology clinic emphasizes enhancing warfighters’ visual performance which means they strive to improve operational readiness by reducing the need for glasses and contact lenses. Service members can have nearsightedness, farsightedness and astigmatism corrected through PRK or LASIK surgery.

Mosley’s duties include ordering specialty implants for surgeries, managing supplies and equipment, and overseeing other ophthalmology surgical techs and hospital corpsmen. Any surgery is nerve-wracking, but especially those involving the eyes, so the surgical techs also help educate their patients on the procedures and what could potentially happen, as well as offer reassurances to calm them.

“I make sure I play a little bit of music for them in my office just to get them ‘zen’d’ out,” Mosley said.

Mosley’s job also includes traveling with patients if they need to be transferred. For example, she might go with a patient to Madigan Army Medical Center on Joint Base Lewis-McChord, Washington, about 45 minutes south, so the doctors performing the surgery have someone familiar with them.

Mosley said getting surgeries set up in a timely fashion in ophthalmology can be challenging, so when patients get the relief they’ve been seeking, it’s incredibly satisfying.

“That is the best part of my job — in real-time seeing how you’ve drastically changed someone’s life,” Mosley said. “I’ve had patients come back, and they’re just so thankful. They thank the entire staff, and they explain how their quality of life has drastically improved.”

Britain’s Draper, ranked 14th in the world, held his nerve to beat Alcaraz 6-1, 0-6, 6-4 and reach the first Masters 1000 final of his career.

Denmark’s Rune, ranked 13th, triumphed 7-5, 6-4 over world number six Daniil Medvedev — who had been runner-up to Alcaraz each of the past two years.

“This one hurts,” admitted Alcaraz, who was trying to join Roger Federer and Novak Djokovic as the only men to win three straight titles in the California desert.

“I don’t want to lose any match, but I think this one was even more special to me. It was difficult today, a lot of nerves in the match.”

Draper ended Alcaraz’s 16-match winning streak in the California desert, leaping out of the gate and wrapping up the first set in 23 minutes as Alcaraz failed to get to grips with the left-hander’s serve.

The second set was a mirror image of the first as Alcaraz found his range and after fending off a break point with a 137 mph ace in the opening game broke Draper three times to level the match.

“It was a strange match in all honesty,” Draper said. “Carlos came out a little flat, I sensed that. I had a chance in the first game of the second, and he came up with an ace …

“What happened to him happened to me, I got tight, I had low energy. I got lost out there for 25 minutes, but in the third, I was really proud of my competitiveness, my attitude and I somehow managed to get over the line.”

Draper, who lost a set to love for the first time in his career, broke Alcaraz for a 2-1 lead in the third in a game that featured a lengthy video review that showed the Briton had indeed managed to scoop back a winner off an Alcaraz drop shot without a double bounce.

Upon review umpire Mohamed Lahyani first called for the point to be replayed but then awarded it to Draper, ruling his “not up” call in the rally hadn’t hindered Alcaraz.

“Waiting for the ball reviews, they didn’t bother me at all,” Alcaraz said. “All I can say is Jack came, he played much better than me. That point didn’t affect my play at all.”

With momentum on his side, Draper broke again for 5-2 lead — Alcaraz failing to put away four game points.

Draper did show some nerves as he served for the match at 5-2 and was broken, abut steadied himself to seal the victory on his second opportunity.

Make it difficult

Rune executed a thoughtful game plan to perfection against Medvedev to snap a seven-match losing streak in semi-finals.

“It was to really play my game, come forward, take the ball on the rise,” Rune said of his strategy against a player known for his defense.

“If you hit hard to him, he likes the pace and he responds well to being in the defense and hitting strong back.

“So I tried to make it difficult for him. I tried to mix it up, making every shot that he has to play annoying for him. Slices, slow slices, some mixing the tempo, hitting hard on some, looping some.”

After an early exchange of breaks in the opening set, Rune managed to grind out a key hold for 4-4, saving one break point in a game that went to deuce six times and lasted nearly 11 minutes.

He broke for a 6-5 lead and pocketed the set when his rolling backhand drew another error from Medvedev, then rode an early break in the second set to victory.",https://media.breitbart.com/media/2025/03/wi/afp/britain-jack-draper-reacts-beating-time-defending-champion-carlos-alcaraz-semi-finals-at-indian-640x335.jpg,N,0.0,2025-03-15 22:50:20.360059

Back on track . . . from the linked article there may be some clues.

Tricare had retroactively denied 26 more claims for a total of about $3,000 worth of services it had already reimbursed providers for since 2019, when he first enrolled in Tricare For Life, a plan for Tricare-eligible people who have Medicare.

Harve has Medicare + TFL and has had both since 2019 (presumably when he turned 65). Medicare is supposed to be primary, TFL secondary. No word on whether the provider claims were properly filed with Medicare.

Tricare also reversed approvals for at least 10 claims, totaling about $100,400, for his wife, Janice, in the same time frame, while nine other claims that had once been marked as completed are being re-processed,

Janice is now 67, so has probably only been eligible for Medicare for 2 years . . . unless her MS triggered SSDI resulting in her possibly being Medicare eligible prior to 65.

Some MS therapies can run $60k to $90k per year.

Health Net Federal Services, the former contractor for the Tricare west region, also said it could not comment on specific cases, citing health privacy laws, but it said it is ""actively looking into the matter.""

TriWest Healthcare Alliance, which took over the contract this year, deferred comment to Health Net, which it said is responsible for processing and paying claims before Jan. 1. TriWest said it has not recouped or tried to recoup any payments from the Smiths and is not allowed to take such actions under its contract with the Defense Health Agency.

The plan administrator change didn't help.

Millions of service members, retirees, their families and network providers nationwide have felt cascading disruptions following Tricare's contract changes this year.

About 16,000 health care providers on the East Coast alone have not been paid this year, officials said, forcing many to drop Tricare patients, reduce their hours or consider closing their clinics. On the West Coast, federal officials said, beneficiaries are struggling with a host of issues, including long wait times at call centers and stalled referrals and authorizations.

Not good . . .

She said they called Tricare For Life, which is Tricare's Medicare program, but were redirected to at least three other numbers. When they finally reached a representative for the military's Defense Enrollment Eligibility Reporting System database, which holds information for every service member, Janice Smith said, they were told the officials had to manually fix her husband's records. The Smiths said database system did not elaborate on what was wrong with his records or what caused the apparent error. They were told to complete a Tricare form asking to reinstate their enrollment, even though they did not know whether they had been removed.

Makes you wonder why TriWest lost the contract. Perhaps they were always inept at record keeping. You gotta wonder what triggered an audit and recission on a $470 claim which seems to be the thing that started the snowball rolling.

Janice Smith said Tricare had initially approved her and her husband's services, which included brain scans to monitor her condition, hip replacement surgery, physical therapy and annual checkups.

This is very scary and doesn't speak well for TFL and their ""beneficiaries"".",,N,-1.0,2025-03-16 15:50:21.754677

TRICARE Provider Types

TRICARE defines a provider as a person, business, or institution that provides health care. Understanding the different TRICARE provider types will help you decide what type of TRICARE provider you want to be. At a minimum, all TRICARE providers must be authorized/certified under TRICARE Regulation and must have their authorization/certification status verified by the regional contractors in each region.

There are two types of TRICARE-authorized providers: Network and Non-Network Providers

Network Providers

If you decide to become a network provider, you will sign a contractual agreement with the regional contractor in your region. You will:

Agree to provide care to TRICARE beneficiaries at a negotiated rate.

Accept the beneficiaries' copayment or cost share as payment in full.

File claims with TRICARE for the remaining amount.

Non-Network Providers

If you don't want to sign a contract, you can be a non-network provider, but you must be certified by the regional contractor. As a non-network provider you can decide to be a ""participating provider"" or a ""non-participating provider.""

Participating providers agree to file claims for beneficiaries, to accept payment directly from TRICARE and to accept the TRICARE allowable charge as payment in full for their services.

Non-participating providers do not agree to accept the TRICARE allowable charge or file beneficiary claims.

Non-network providers can choose to participate on a claim-by-claim basis. You don't have to be participating or non-participating all of the time.",https://health.mil/-/media/Images/MHS/Photos/Default-MHS-Seal.png,N,0.0,2025-03-15 12:50:20.049678
