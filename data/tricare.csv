To spot new patterns within this data, Pugh uses a strategy called complexity theory.

“I am incredibly proud of our work,” Pugh adds.","Nearly one in five U.S. veterans have experienced a traumatic brain injury (TBI), mostly in the form of a concussion. Now, the full long-term health consequences of TBI are starting to be uncovered, thanks in large part to the work of Mary Jo Pugh, PhD, RN, professor of epidemiology at University of Utah Health and investigator with the Informatics, Decision-Enhancement and Analytical Sciences (IDEAS) Center of Innovation at the VA Salt Lake City Healthcare System.

On August 4, Pugh won an Outstanding Research Accomplishment award at the 2025 Military Health System Research Symposium for her TBI research. The award recognizes individual investigators who have recently made outstanding contributions to medical research via work funded by the Department of Defense. Pugh is one of only two investigators nationwide to receive this honor.

Pugh’s work revealed that TBI is associated with many long-term health consequences that were previously unknown, including dementia, substance use disorder, and even cardiovascular disease. TBI is also linked to higher risk of suicide and cancer. Uncovering these patterns of risk is a first step toward preemptive interventions to help veterans with TBI stay healthy.

Key to her work is Pugh’s ability to uncover patterns hidden within big data. Her work helped integrate health data between the VA and the Department of Defense—an essential step to understanding how TBI acquired during military service can impact health after someone leaves the military.

“This linkage is invaluable because it allows us to analyze long-term health outcomes while incorporating crucial details from military service—such as injury characteristics and blast exposures—that are missing from VA data alone,” Pugh says.

“This ‘gold mine’ of data has enabled rapid and critical surveillance of Military Occupational Blast Exposure (MOBE) from large weapons,” she adds, “which is vital because many service members with MOBE do not have a specific documented injury or diagnosis, which is essential to demonstrate service connection for disability claims.”

Pugh leads the Data and Biostatistics Core for a national research consortium called LIMBIC, a DoD- and VA-funded group that brings together nearly 40 organizations to study the chronic effects of brain trauma in a cohort of over 2.5 million people.

To spot new patterns within this data, Pugh uses a strategy called complexity theory. This method of data analysis allows her to disentangle the effects of concussion from other contributors to health, finding long-term health outcomes that other analyses don’t detect.

“This is a voluntary program and Network Directors retain authority to approve or disapprove of requests,” the DHA official said.","The Defense Health Agency is granting voluntary buyouts to certain employees on a job-by-job basis as the Trump administration’s large-scale government workforce reduction campaign plows on.

After approving more than 1,000 officials to exit through the Voluntary Early Retirement Agreement (VERA), Deferred Resignation Program (DRP) and other methods extended by the Defense Department to date, DHA leadership has “authorized Network Directors to offer the Voluntary Separation Incentive Payment or VSIP” options to interested personnel, an agency official told DefenseScoop on Monday.

DHA delivers health care for service members and their families and is a combat support agency. The organization manages the Military Health System and supports its infrastructure for DOD, and also steers a range of other research, training and modernization initiatives.

Notably, DHA has reported recent progress in its pursuits to strategically set the foundation for the integration, adoption and deployment of reliable artificial intelligence in military medicine. Last year, agency officials produced an inventory of AI use cases, new planning guidance and a digital health strategy. Among other activities, they also completed an exercise to identify potential vulnerabilities, biases and risks associated with emerging generative AI capabilities.

According to DHA’s official website, 130,000-plus staff members operate more than 700 facilities worldwide.

At the beginning of his second term, President Donald Trump launched a disruptive initiative known as DOGE, to uncover “waste, fraud and abuse” across the federal government and slash some spending and staff positions to spur savings.

Per Trump’s directions, Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth swiftly ordered a “strategic reduction” of 5-8% of DOD’s civilian personnel, through incentive opportunities such as DRP and VERA, and other means of cutting the workforce.

By early August, defense officials confirmed that roughly 55,000 applications had been approved for DRP across the department.

In an email to DefenseScoop on Monday, a DHA official said: “As of Aug. 8, 2025, 972 employees within all DHA-administered properties opted for the Deferred Resignation Program (both the [White House Office of Personnel Management] and DOD programs), and 49 persons opted for the Voluntary Early Retirement Agreement option.”

The agency also moved to authorize network directors the option to offer “the Voluntary Separation Incentive Payment or VSIP incentive as they deem necessary to shape their workforce to continue to provide safe, high-quality health care for our beneficiaries and sustain our critical readiness support mission,” they confirmed.

VSIPs essentially refer to specific financial incentives — typically in the form of lump-sum payments — that the federal government can present to encourage federal employees to make the choice to leave their positions, through retirement or resignation.

Pharmacy benefit managers serve as intermediaries between health plans, drug manufacturers, and pharmacies.
The practices of pharmacy benefit managers have been under scrutiny in recent years at both the state and federal levels.
Arkansas lawmakers enacted legislation in 2015 to regulate pharmacy benefit managers’ payments to pharmacies, and in 2020 the U.S. Supreme Court upheld the law.
On July 31, the Arkansas State Board of Pharmacy filed notice that it will appeal the order blocking Act 624.","A federal judge recently issued a preliminary injunction blocking enforcement of Arkansas Act 624 of 2025, a law that would have prohibited pharmacy benefit managers (PBMs) from owning or operating pharmacies in the state.

Pharmacy benefit managers serve as intermediaries between health plans, drug manufacturers, and pharmacies. When a person with prescription drug coverage fills a prescription, the PBM reimburses the pharmacy at a negotiated rate, and the insurer pays the PBM. Some PBMs, such as CVS, own their own pharmacies.

Supporters of Act 624 have said the law is needed because PBM ownership of pharmacies creates conflicts of interest, is anti-competitive, and can lead to higher prices for consumers. A group of PBMs and the Pharmaceutical Care Management Association, which represents PBMs, is challenging the law, arguing it is unconstitutional. CVS

After a hearing on July 23, 2025, U.S. District Judge Brian Miller granted motions for a preliminary injunction blocking the law, which was set to take effect January 1, 2026. Miller found that the law would likely violate the Commerce Clause of the U.S. Constitution by unfairly discriminating against the plaintiffs as out-of-state businesses and failing to show that this would be the only way to advance the state’s interest. The judge also found that the law would likely violate the Supremacy Clause by interfering with the ability of TRICARE, the federal health benefits program for military personnel and retirees, to contract with PBMs. Under the Supremacy Clause, state laws that interfere with or are contrary to federal laws are invalid, Miller noted.

The practices of pharmacy benefit managers have been under scrutiny in recent years at both the state and federal levels. Arkansas lawmakers enacted legislation in 2015 to regulate pharmacy benefit managers’ payments to pharmacies, and in 2020 the U.S. Supreme Court upheld the law. In June 2022, the Federal Trade Commission decided to launch an examination into the business practices of PBMs.

On July 31, the Arkansas State Board of Pharmacy filed notice that it will appeal the order blocking Act 624. Litigation will continue in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Arkansas. Because Arkansas is the first state to enact a ban on ownership of pharmacies by PBMs, Act 624, if upheld, could serve as a model for other states seeking to rein in these prescription drug middlemen.",https://achi.net/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/AdobeStock_181683115.jpeg,N,0.0,2025-08-18 14:56:08.889984

Lt. Gen. Brian T. Kelly, USAF (Ret), urged lawmakers to ensure important servicemember- and military family-focused provisions remain intact as the FY 2026 National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA) moves toward floor consideration. The letter was sent to every member of the House and Senate Armed Services Committees – panels that play a pivotal role in shaping defense policy.

[GET INVOLVED: Visit MOAA's Legislative Action Center]

The Aug. 12 letter came after both committees passed versions of the NDAA but before either chamber has taken floor action. This pre-floor period is a critical opportunity for lawmakers to add, amend, or protect provisions before the legislation advances to the next phase of the congressional process.

Kelly’s letter identifies several priority items from both the House and Senate committee-passed NDAA bills:

House

Presentation by a Veterans Service Organization (VSO) in Transition Assistance Program (TAP) Counseling: Supports transition by requiring approved VSO involvement to help navigate and access benefits.

Family Separation Allowance (FSA) Increase: Increases FSA to $400 per month, improving support for families while servicemembers are away from home in service of our country.

Pilot Program on Access to Obstetrical and Gynecological Care Under TRICARE Prime: Streamlines access to care by eliminating a TRICARE Prime referral requirement for OB-GYN care.

Pilot Program to Treat Pregnancy as a Qualifying Life Event for Enrollment in TRICARE Select: Improves access to prenatal care by allowing pregnant beneficiaries to switch TRICARE plans outside of the annual open season.

She wants her two organizations to be focused on supporting their subordinate units, integrating solutions to optimize healthcare delivery and medical readiness, while avoiding confusion and frustration.
U.S. Army Col. James “Jimmy” Watts is the director of Madigan Army Medical Center at Joint Base Lewis-McChord near Tacoma, Washington, as well as the commander of the medical readiness unit there.","Military medicine in the Indo-Pacific region took a major leap forward during a strategic offsite conference August 11-13 as more than 80 leaders from the Defense Health Agency’s Defense Health Network Indo-Pacific and the Army’s Medical Readiness Command, Pacific met to establish a common governance framework. The resulting framework will help the two organizations combine the separate missions of health care and medical readiness into an integrated process, enhancing both access to health care for patients and medical readiness for soldiers, sailors, airmen and Marines.

U.S. Army Brig. Gen. Deydre S. Teyhen used her extensive governance experience to lead the conference. She currently serves as the director of DHN IP, which oversees military medical facilities in Washington, California, Hawaii, Japan, and the Republic of Korea. She is also the commanding general of MRC, P, which provides command and control to medical department activities, medical centers, dental health commands, Public Health Command, Pacific, and soldier recovery units in Washington, Alaska, Hawaii, Japan, and the Republic of Korea.

Assuming both roles in April, she brought important lessons about governance from her previous assignment as the director of DHN National Capital Region, which treats the military community as well as the President of the United States, members of Congress, and the Supreme Court.

“We often focus on the 5W’s: who, what, when, where, and why—but in the NCR, we focused on the ‘how,’” said Teyhen as she departed the East Coast. “How we lead, how we build trust, and how we treat our people and patients. How is critical in leading the joy and soul back to medicine. Governance gave us the foundation to transform this network into an integrated healthcare system that focused on making it better for our patients and our staff.”

During Teyhen’s NCR tour, she saw governance help the network increase patient enrollment and access, expand virtual health, increase operating room utilization, and make many other improvements. In her current dual roles, she faces the additional challenge of integrating DHA’s patient health care mission with the Army’s medical readiness mission. As the leader of two staffs in different agencies, she saw the need to bring them together by creating a shared mission, vision and values. Teyhen also knew that two separate processes would create confusion and inefficiencies, which could be alleviated by a shared governance model.

“We aim to adopt an integrated approach, ensuring unifying governance and decisions within MRC, P, and DHN IP, while also promoting empowered leaders who drive effectiveness and efficiency,” stated Teyhen.

She wants her two organizations to be focused on supporting their subordinate units, integrating solutions to optimize healthcare delivery and medical readiness, while avoiding confusion and frustration.

Teyhen also noted there is record burnout in both the military and civilian healthcare systems. Reducing the burden on healthcare providers is critical to providing quality health care for patients, and increasing efficiency and standardization can help.

To assist with creating a combined governance model for DHN-IP and MRC, P, Teyhen brought in an expert team from DHN NCR to facilitate the strategic offsite, led by John Gardner, DHN NCR’s assistant director for network operations.

According to Gardner, governance is “a structured framework of roles, processes, and mechanisms that empowers leaders to set direction, establish priorities, and drive effective change. It ensures accountability, effectively manages risk, and aligns actions with strategic goals, enabling agility.”

Many of the world’s largest and most effective organizations utilize a governance model, said Gardner, including Apple, Microsoft and premiere healthcare systems like Johns Hopkins, Cleveland Clinic and the Mayo Clinic. Yet, some people are hesitant to embrace governance, and misconceptions persist. For instance, some think “governance” means an increase in bureaucracy, more meetings, wasted time, and decreased flexibility.

“The truth is just the opposite,” said Gardner. Governance increases efficiency and clarifies responsibilities. At NCR, governance reduced more than 130 meetings to just a few. It can help align priorities and share best practices, uphold common standards of care, and build trust among stakeholders, including patients and providers.

Some people look at governance as an opportunity. U.S. Army Col. James “Jimmy” Watts is the director of Madigan Army Medical Center at Joint Base Lewis-McChord near Tacoma, Washington, as well as the commander of the medical readiness unit there. According to Watts, prior to the offsite he “was optimistic about the opportunity to align and integrate the efforts of both organizations into a cohesive and coherent effort.”

During the three-day offsite, Gardner’s team instructed attendees about the need for governance and guiding principles, then led them through case studies to illustrate how effective governance can prevent or solve problems. For instance, in one case study, the business resources division in a fictional health system reduced funding for environmental services staff without consulting clinical leaders, which resulted in increased infection rates in the hospital and tension between the business and clinical teams. In another example, unclear appointing and booking protocols led to miscommunication between medical offices, causing a cancer patient to hang in administrative limbo and delaying his treatment.

Effective governance could have prevented both by creating processes for different offices to coordinate prior to making decisions that could affect others. In another example, governance would have provided standardization for medical carts, which would have helped a nurse find correct medication in a timely manner after she moved from one hospital to another.

Gardner’s team also led offsite participants as they developed the committees that form the foundation of the governance structure. With representation from medical, dental, veterinary, public health, human resources, business resources, and senior enlisted leaders, they developed a Board of Directors, which oversees a Medical Affairs Committee, Network Regional Operations Committee, Resource Management Committee, and Senior Enlisted Leader Committee. Each of those committees will ultimately be supported by multiple councils, working groups and sprint team. For instance, the MAC will include a council of nurses, and the RMC will include a human resources council.

Teyhen emphasized throughout the process that collaboration is key. In each committee, there are voting members from DHN IP and MRC, P as well as each of the network’s major medical facilities and the readiness command’s direct reporting units.

With the committees established, participants next determined each committee’s authorities and responsibilities as well as voting and non-voting members. Finally, the committees developed proposed priorities for the next few months.

With proposed priorities scribbled on paper on the wall, Gardner allowed all the participants to vote on initial priorities, such as operating room optimization and standardization of medical services across facilities, before leading the participants through the first Board of Directors meeting where the board approved the proposed authorities, membership team and initial priorities.

“The next step is to put this in motion,” said Gardner. “There is a lot of work to do and a lot to figure out, but I’m happy to help you put this into effect.”

Watts is optimistic that the new governance structure will be beneficial. “I believe the conference was positively reinforcing, because we have taken concrete steps towards hardwiring critical organizational processes,” said Watts. “This will increase information and knowledge sharing, as well as decision transparency.” He also believes “the newly established governance system will help MAMC streamline its headquarters and organizational structure.”",https://dha.mil/-/media/Project/Images/News-Images/9260343.jpg,N,0.0,2025-08-18 15:56:31.448642

James “Jimmy” Watts is the director of Madigan Army Medical Center at Joint Base Lewis-McChord near Tacoma, Washington, as well as the commander of the medical readiness unit there. According to Watts, prior to the offsite he “was optimistic about the opportunity to align and integrate the efforts of both organizations into a cohesive and coherent effort.”

During the three-day offsite, Gardner’s team instructed attendees about the need for governance and guiding principles, then led them through case studies to illustrate how effective governance can prevent or solve problems. For instance, in one case study, the business resources division in a fictional health system reduced funding for environmental services staff without consulting clinical leaders, which resulted in increased infection rates in the hospital and tension between the business and clinical teams. In another example, unclear appointing and booking protocols led to miscommunication between medical offices, causing a cancer patient to hang in administrative limbo and delaying his treatment.

Effective governance could have prevented both by creating processes for different offices to coordinate prior to making decisions that could affect others. In another example, governance would have provided standardization for medical carts, which would have helped a nurse find correct medication in a timely manner after she moved from one hospital to another.

Gardner’s team also led offsite participants as they developed the committees that form the foundation of the governance structure. With representation from medical, dental, veterinary, public health, human resources, business resources, and senior enlisted leaders, they developed a Board of Directors, which oversees a Medical Affairs Committee, Network Regional Operations Committee, Resource Management Committee, and Senior Enlisted Leader Committee. Each of those committees will ultimately be supported by multiple councils, working groups and sprint team. For instance, the MAC will include a council of nurses, and the RMC will include a human resources council.

Teyhen emphasized throughout the process that collaboration is key. In each committee, there are voting members from DHN IP and MRC, P as well as each of the network’s major medical facilities and the readiness command’s direct reporting units.

With the committees established, participants next determined each committee’s authorities and responsibilities as well as voting and non-voting members. Finally, the committees developed proposed priorities for the next few months.

With proposed priorities scribbled on paper on the wall, Gardner allowed all the participants to vote on initial priorities, such as operating room optimization and standardization of medical services across facilities, before leading the participants through the first Board of Directors meeting where the board approved the proposed authorities, membership team and initial priorities.

“The next step is to put this in motion,” said Gardner. “There is a lot of work to do and a lot to figure out, but I’m happy to help you put this into effect.”

Watts is optimistic that the new governance structure will be beneficial. “I believe the conference was positively reinforcing, because we have taken concrete steps towards hardwiring critical organizational processes,” said Watts. “This will increase information and knowledge sharing, as well as decision transparency.” He also believes “the newly established governance system will help MAMC streamline its headquarters and organizational structure.”",https://d1ldvf68ux039x.cloudfront.net/thumbs/photos/2508/9260343/1000w_q95.jpg,N,0.0,2025-08-18 13:56:09.937619

TRICARE beneficiaries in Routt County are now eligible to receive emergency prescription refills through Aug. 24. For beneficiaries in Rio Blanco County, the date has been extended from Aug. 16 to Aug. 24.

As a reminder, beneficiaries in Delta County may receive refills through Aug. 16 due to the Elk and LeRoux Fires, and beneficiaries in Archuleta County may receive emergency prescription refills through Aug. 21 due to the Oak Fire.

To receive an emergency refill of prescription medications, TRICARE beneficiaries should take their prescription bottle to any TRICARE retail network pharmacy. If the bottle is unavailable or the label is damaged or missing, beneficiaries should contact Express Scripts, Inc., or their retail network pharmacy for assistance.

To find a network pharmacy, beneficiaries may call Express Scripts at 1-877-363-1303, or search the network pharmacy locator: https://militaryrx.express-scripts.com/find-pharmacy

If possible, visit the pharmacy where the prescription was filled. Prescriptions filled by a retail chain may be filled at another store in that chain. If the clinician who prescribed the medication is available, beneficiaries can ask them to call in a new prescription to any network pharmacy.

As a reminder, TRICARE beneficiaries, other than active duty service members, may receive urgent care from any TRICARE-authorized urgent care center or provider and do not need a referral. This allows beneficiaries to seek nonemergency care for illnesses or injuries if their primary care provider is unavailable because of emergencies. Any TRICARE beneficiary who reasonably believes they have an emergency should always call 911 or, go to the nearest emergency room.

Beneficiaries are advised to visit Express Scripts’ Weather Notices page for updates: https://militaryrx.express-scripts.com/notices/weather

Marriage Counseling vs. Family Counseling in TRICARE’s Eyes Many people don’t realize TRICARE may categorize “marriage counseling” under “family therapy” if it involves more than one person in the session.","Does TRICARE cover marriage counseling?

Well, yes, only with several conditions. In general, TRICARE will pay for couples or marriage counseling when it is a part of treating a diagnosed mental health condition in one or both spouses. In case it is a mere general improvement of relationships, and there is no diagnosis, it is not covered.

As Anna Welch, a U.S. citizen who’s spent years helping military families navigate TRICARE’s rules, I know how confusing the system can be. Between plan requirements, referral processes, and finding an authorized provider, it’s easy to feel lost.

In this blog, I’ll cover who qualifies, which mental health issues make counseling eligible, how to find a provider, the coverage process, costs, and online therapy options.

What is TRICARE?

TRICARE is the United States Department of Defense’s Official Health Care Program for its members, retirees people and the families of the military. It caters to on-duty service personnel, National Guard, and Reserve personnel, qualifying veterans, and survivors. TRICARE is not bare bones medical care, but provides coverage of a vast variety of medical, dental, vision, mental health treatment, and specialty care. The program is based on work with military treatment facilities and civilian providers, depending on your location and plan type.

Learning TRICARE work functions is important since the TRICARE coverages, when providing services such as marriage counseling, are highly specific. Being aware of the rules beforehand may save you time, money, and frustration when you want assistance in the relationship.

Only Diagnosed Mental Health Covered

You may well be asking yourself whether TRICARE will cover marriage counseling because you and your spouse would like to work on your relationship. The brief answer is no. Counseling to help improve your relationship, learn how to communicate with one another, or receive premarital counseling is not covered by TRICARE. The overall condition is that TRICARE will only compensate for marriage or couples counseling about a recognized mental health disorder in one or both partners.

As a military helper myself, this appears to be the most common cause of people’s downfall. They assume marriage counseling is treated like any other preventive health service, but TRICARE treats it as a mental health intervention, and that means there must be a documented, diagnosable condition.

What This Means for You

One of the partners has to be assessed and have a mental health condition, at least of depression, anxiety, PTSD, substance use disorder, or adjustment disorder.

Couples counseling should be medically required and recommended by a mental health provider sanctioned by TRICARE in the treatment program.

Your provider must document how the therapy supports the treatment of that diagnosis.

If there’s no diagnosis, you’ll have to pay out of pocket for marriage counseling.

Why TRICARE Has This Rule

TRICARE is a health insurance program that is operated by the government, and similar to the majority of other health insurance plans, it only covers this or that types of services which is deemed to be medically necessary. General relationship problems, though very real and quite important, do not come up to that criterion unless they are associated with a well-defined mental health problem.

Example Scenarios

Covered: Your spouse was diagnosed with PTSD, and your mental health doctor suggests that couples counseling would assist in communicating and supporting you during the treatment time.

Not Covered: You and your partner are disagreeing more, and you both want to fix your marriage, but neither of you has a diagnosable mental health issue.

Who Qualifies?

TRICARE’s marriage counseling coverage isn’t open to just anyone; you have to be eligible under their health program.

From my perspective, here’s exactly who can qualify:

Active Duty Service Members: While you serve, you are covered by TRICARE. Your spouse is also covered.

Retired Service Members: You and your spouse can continue to have coverage during retirement when you continue enrolling in TRICARE.

National Guard & Reserve Members: You and your dependents are covered, provided you are on active duty orders or are eligible under TRICARE Reserve Select.

Survivors: As the surviving spouse of an active service member, eligible to get TRICARE you are not denied benefits.

Retired Members, Medically: They and their families are freely provided with full, including mental health, coverage.

The main point? You must be officially enrolled in a TRICARE plan; without that, there’s no access to any mental health coverage.

Which Mental Health Issues Qualify?

Marriage or couples counseling will be covered by TRICARE only in the presence of a diagnosed and treatable mental health condition within one or both spouses.

Here are only some of the most common conditions under which the door to coverage opens:

Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD): This is connected with military jobs, trauma, or combat-related.

Depression: These include major depressive disorder; persistent depressive disorder.

Persistent stress and worry about daily interactions and activities are signs of generalized anxiety disorder (GAD).

Adjustment Disorders: Failure to cope with such severe life changes as migration or deployment.

Substance Use Disorders: Alcohol or drug dependence, and the use of couples therapy as a part of recovery.

Other diagnoses of the DSM-5: Examples of these are bipolar disorder, panic disorder, among others.

If you or your spouse isn’t sure whether your symptoms fit these categories, you’ll need a mental health evaluation. The first step toward TRICARE coverage is the diagnosis.

Finding an Authorized Provider

You will have to use the services of a TRICARE-authorized person, not an arbitrarily selected local therapist.

Who is Authorized?

LMFTs: Licensed Marriage and Family Therapists

LCSWs: Licensed Clinical Social Workers

PhD/Psy D Clinical Psychologists

MD or DO psychiatrists

How to Find One:

Visit the TRICARE Find a Doctor Tool on their official website.

Select “Mental Health” as your specialty.

Filter by your TRICARE plan (e.g., Prime, Select).

Confirm that they indeed practice couples therapy in the mental health treatment regime.

In my personal experience, I would advise calling the office of any provider before booking and asking about being in-network, as this will save a headache later.

Referral Required?

The answer depends on your TRICARE plan:

TRICARE Prime:

Usually requires a referral from your Primary Care Manager (PCM) to any mental health specialist.

Without it, you risk higher costs or complete denial of coverage.

TRICARE Select:

No referral needed, but the provider still must be TRICARE-authorized.

Active Duty Service Members:

In any non-emergency specialty, mental health care always requires referral.

Note: Although your plan may not need any referral, you should still know how to tell your PCM, as that would help your medical record represent the care.

Getting Covered: Step-by-Step Process

Here’s the path I recommend if you want TRICARE to cover your marriage counseling:

Talk to Your PCM: Explain your relationship struggles and how they’re affecting your mental health.

Get a Mental Health Evaluation: This step determines if there’s a qualifying diagnosis.

Get a Referral (where necessary): Paperwork taken care of by your PCM or mental health provider.

Select a TRICARE- Authorized Provider: Make sure they are in-network and provide couples treatment.

Participate in Counseling: This is the most effective way to keep to the treatment schedule.

Follow up on the coverage after the First Session: phone TRICARE or log on online to make certain that the claim was filed.

Copays and Costs

TRICARE coverage reduces costs dramatically, but it’s not always 100% free.

TRICARE Prime:

$0 copay for active duty members

Small copay for retirees and dependents

TRICARE Select:

Copays vary based on the sponsor’s status (active duty vs. retired) and provider network

Lower costs for in-network providers

Out-of-Network Care:

Higher costs and possible denial of full coverage

Advice from me: Always double-check the provider’s status before your first session to avoid surprise bills.

Online Therapy: Talkspace

Online therapy, which may involve couples therapy, is offered by TRICARE in collaboration with Talkspace.

Why it’s worth considering:

Sessions via secure text, audio, or video calls

Great for geographically separated couples or those on deployment

Flexible scheduling with licensed providers

Note: As with face-to-face therapy, treatment for hormonal needs requires a qualifying diagnosis to be covered by TRICARE.

Real-Life Tips & Stories

I’ve seen both sides of this process. One military spouse I know couldn’t get coverage for marriage counseling because neither she nor her husband had a diagnosable condition, so they ended up paying privately.

Another friend’s husband was diagnosed with PTSD after deployment. Their couples therapy was folded into his treatment plan, and TRICARE covered it entirely. A major factor in their recovery as a marriage was counseling.

From what I’ve learned, here’s my advice for you:

Don’t downplay symptoms; be honest in evaluations

Keep all paperwork and referral forms

Check coverage before starting sessions

If you’re denied, ask about the appeals process

TRICARE Plan Types and How They Affect Coverage

You can explain that TRICARE has several plan options, and coverage rules can vary:

TRICARE Prime: A low cost with the least expensive coverage, but with the necessity of referrals.

TRICARE Select: increased vendor options, no references, higher out-of-pocket expenses.

TRICARE Reserve Select: For eligible personnel of the National Guard and Reserve.

TRICARE For Life: For military retirees eligible for Medicare.

TRICARE Overseas Program: Rules for service members and families stationed abroad.

Marriage Counseling vs. Family Counseling in TRICARE’s Eyes

Many people don’t realize TRICARE may categorize “marriage counseling” under “family therapy” if it involves more than one person in the session. This matters because:

The provider’s billing code affects TRICARE’s payment status.

The diagnosis must be tied to one person, even if both partners attend.

How Session Limits Work

Some TRICARE plans may limit the number of covered mental health sessions before requiring a re-authorization. For example:

You might get up to 8 sessions without additional approval.

Beyond that, the provider may need to submit updated clinical notes.

What Happens if You’re Stationed Overseas

Under the TRICARE Overseas Program rules are different:

It can be paid in advance and file a claim to get a rebate.

Not every state has TRICARE-approved marriage guidance counselors, so telehealth may be the optimum solution.

The Appeal Process if Denied

In case the TRICARE refuses to cover your marriage counseling:

Step 1: Check the denial letter to understand the reasons why it has been rejected.

Step 2: Develop follow-up papers (diagnosis, treatment plan notes).

Step 3: First Level appeal(must be within the deadline; say 90 days).

Step 4: Denied again? Ask for a Second-Level Appeal.

Alternative Low-Cost or Free Options

Unless you are eligible for TRICARE-covered counseling, you might consider:

Military OneSource: Provides short-term and free relationship counseling.

Chaplains: free confidential counseling.

Community Mental Health Clinics: Sliding fees.

Common Myths

You can bust a few myths:

Myth: TRICARE covers any marriage counseling if you’re married to a service member.

Fact: Coverage is only for diagnosed mental health conditions.

Myth: You are free to choose any therapist.

Fact: They should be authorized for TRICARE.

FAQs:

Does TRICARE cover marriage counseling for any reason?

No. TRICARE only covers it if it’s part of treatment for a diagnosed mental health condition.

Which mental ailments are covered?

These might include substance use disorders, adjustment disorders, anxiety, depression, and PTSD.

Is marriage counseling a referral program?

If you have TRICARE Prime, yes. There is no requirement for a recommendation if you have TRICARE Select.

Can I choose any counselor I want?

No. The provider must be TRICARE-authorized.

Does TRICARE cover online marriage counseling?

Yes, through options like Talkspace, but the same diagnosis requirement applies.

Final Words:

When your marriage is having problems, asking for help is a show of strength rather than weakness. TRICARE may be your friend, so long as you know its rules. Here is the plain truth: unless one has a diagnosed mental health condition and a plan of treatment, there will be no coverage. However, TRICARE might be the key that will unlock access to professional help that would allow you and your spouse to restore trust and increase communication, as well as to overcome challenges as a unit.

Do not leave it until minor fissures become wide enough. Contact a TRICARE-enrolled mental health care provider, get the diagnosis, should you need it, and proceed with the process step-by-step. The later you respond, the earlier you can work on healing your marriage because a healthy marriage does not just benefit you, it also benefits the family, the future, and your inner peace.",https://reallovetips.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Military-Couple-Counseling.png,N,0.0,2025-08-17 11:56:12.993359
