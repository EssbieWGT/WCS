Now a congressional committee is also calling for changes to benefits for people living with autism.

A new study shows the old way of coverage isn't working.

Families could be near the end of their battle for effective healthcare coverage. The Defense Health Agency (DHA) could soon make changes to the way some military families get autism therapy services they need.

""There were a lot of hoops to jump through,"" said military spouse Rebecca Brown.

Her 6-year-old daughter is autistic and needs Applied Behavioral Analysis (ABA). It's a type of therapy specifically tailored to her needs; right now, it's not the easiest to get enrolled in.

""In the Autism Care Demonstration (ACD), there are different assessments that we're required to complete -- both the families and the ABA therapy providers,"" Brown said.

The ACD program has been around since 2014. Brown said she's faced struggles since learning of her daughter's diagnosis.

""Every three months I was spending, no joke, about eight hours on the computer going through each of these and there wasn't any change in the services that my daughter received based on the outcomes of those tests,"" Brown said.

""Autism care services have really evolved over the last 10 years. We need to evolve and be dynamic along with it,"" said Eric Flake, an developmental behavioral pediatrician.

In 2023, Congress called for recommendations on how to better serve military families with an autism diagnosis as part of the National Defense Authorization act. The National Academy of Science published those recommendations this month, Eric Flake was on the committee commissioned by the DHA to write them.

""One of the things that we did recognize is that there is enough evidence at this time to now move it from a demonstration to a basic benefit,"" Flake said. ""We think that that's a timely recommendation.""

That means, instead of going through the 'hoops' Rebecca described, families can get a referral from a doctor and go straight to an ABA specialist. In the report, the committee said the ACD ""lags behind current clinical science and best practices"", calling for ABA to becoming a basic Tricare benefit.

RELATED |

""The requirement to do all these extra things when we know that we need access to this service was just a huge barrier for families like mine,"" Brown said.

Now, congress has a decision to make.

""We are hopeful and excited that the Defense Health Agency, that nonprofit organizations, that congress who asked us to put this together will look at the recommendations and act,"" Flake said.

""This panel, that DoD commissioned themselves, has given them the results that it is effective,"" Brown said. ""It should be covered..we should get that change done, and -- done quickly.""

We reached out to the DHA for comment about those recommendations. Their team sent us a statement saying they're carefully reviewing the entire report to determine their way forward with the ACD program. Until they finish their review, DHA will keep their services under the ACD program.

We'll keep you updated in their final decision.

Judicial Watch Sues FBI for Communications with Anti-Trump Organization

Judicial Watch is still actively working to reveal the anti-Trump lawfare shenanigans of the Biden Justice Department and FBI.

We filed a Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) lawsuit against the U.S. Department of Justice for communications between former Assistant Special Agent in Charge Timothy Thibault and the anti-Trump organization American Oversight (Judicial Watch Inc. v. U.S. Department of Justice (No. 1:25-cv–02556)).

Judicial Watch sued in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia after the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) failed to respond to a January 31, 2025, FOIA request for:

Records and communications between Timothy Thibault, former [Assistant Special Agent in Charge, Washington Field Office] and the non-profit organization American Oversight, 1030 15th St. NW, B255, Washington, D.C. 20005, email domain: @americanoversight. The search terms for this request are a) Trump b) Electors c) Investigation d) election

In July 2022, U.S. Senator Chuck Grassley (R-IA) reportedly warned then-Attorney General Merrick Garland that Thibault and an official in the Justice Department’s Public Integrity Section, Richard Pilger, were “deeply involved in the decisions to open and pursue election-related investigations against President Trump. At the time, whistleblowers told Grassley that the Thibault-Pilger investigation’s predicating document was based on information from ‘liberal nonprofit American Oversight.’” Thibault retired in August 2022.

Earlier this year, Senators Grassley and Ron Johnson (R-WI) publicized records dating back to 2022 about Thibault’s targeting of Trump:

Internal FBI emails and predicating documents provided to Grassley and released jointly by the two senators show Timothy Thibault, a former FBI Assistant Special Agent in Charge (ASAC) who was forced to retire from the Bureau after Grassley exposed his public anti-Trump bias, authored the initial language for what ultimately became Jack Smith’s federal case against Trump regarding the 2020 presidential election. Records show Thibault essentially opened and approved his own investigation.

American Oversight describes itself as “founded in 2017 in response to the unprecedented challenges that the Trump administration posed to our nation’s democratic ideals and institutions.…” Earlier this year, Politico described it as, “A left-leaning watchdog group … working to gather materials that could feed Congressional investigations into the Trump administration.”

It’s a shame that we must sue to get these records about how the Biden gang at the FBI and DOJ tried to rig an election by jailing Trump for disputing the 2020 election. It’s past time for these institutions to focus on transparency under law, so the American people can know the full truth of the lawfare attack perpetrated on Trump.

We have actively pursued transparency for the lawfare waged against Trump.

In June 2025, we launched a related lawsuit against the Justice Department for records about the FBI’s investigation of Trump codenamed “Arctic Frost,” which was part of the Biden administration effort to prosecute and jail President Trump for disputing Biden’s controversial election victory (Judicial Watch, Inc. v. U.S. Department of Justice (No. 1:25-cv-02011)).

In March 2025, we sued the Justice Department for details of any investigations, inquiries, or referrals concerning potential misconduct of any person working for Special Counsel Jack Smith (Judicial Watch Inc. v U.S. Department of Justice (No. 1:25-cv-00801)).

Also in March, Georgia District Attorney Fani Willis was ordered to turn over 212 pages of records to a state court judge. The court also ordered Willis to detail how the records were found and the reason for withholding them from the public. The records were belatedly disclosed in response to a Judicial Watch request and lawsuit for communications with Special Counsel Jack Smith and the House January 6 Committee. In January, we were awarded $21,578 for “attorney’s fees and costs” incurred in the case. The court previously found Willis in default and stated: “The Court finds Defendant [Willis, in her official capacity] is in default and has been since 11 April 2024”(Judicial Watch Inc. v. Fani Willis et al. (No. 24-CV-002805)).

In January 2025, a federal court ordered the Justice Department to provide us information on communications between Special Counsel Jack Smith and Willis regarding the prosecution of then-former President Donald Trump. In May, the Justice Department was directed to search text messages from the Special Counsel’s Office for responsive records (Judicial Watch v U.S. Department of Justice (No. 23-cv-03110).

In January 2025, records from the U.S. Department of Homeland Security (DHS) showed it and the FBI warning that law enforcement agencies should be prepared for a surge in threats from so-called Domestic Violence Extremists (DVEs) following the August 8, 2022, FBI raid on Trump’s Mar-a-Lago estate in Palm Beach, Florida (Judicial Watch Inc. v U.S. Department of Homeland Security (1:22-cv-03275)).

In May 2024, we uncovered a recording of a phone message left by an FBI special agent for someone at the Secret Service in the context of the raid on Trump’s Mar-a-Lago home (Judicial Watch Inc. v. U.S Department of Homeland Security (No. 1:22-cv-03147)).

In February 2024, the Justice Department asked a federal court to allow the agency to keep secret the names of top staffers working in Special Counsel Jack Smith’s office that was targeting Trump and other Americans (Judicial Watch Inc. v U.S. Department of Justice (No. 1:23-cv-01485)).

In August 2022, we successfully sued to unseal the search warrant affidavit used to justify the unprecedented raid on Trump’s home (U.S. v. Sealed Search Warrant (No. 9:22-mj-08332)).

Judicial Watch Sues Justice Department for Communications on Biden-Hur Audio, Epstein Memo

The American public deserves to know the details surrounding the leaks of “exclusive” U.S. Department of Justice information on the Biden-Hur interviews and the Epstein client list memo.

Judicial Watch filed a Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) lawsuit against the Justice Department for its communication with the media outlet Axios regarding the outlet’s “exclusives” on the release of audio of then-President Joe Biden’s August 2023 interview with then-Special Counsel Robert Hur regarding Biden’s handling of secret documents and the July 2025 memo that states there is no Jeffrey Epstein “client list” (Judicial Watch Inc. v. U.S. Department of Justice (No. 1:25-cv-03225)).

We sued the Justice Department after it failed to comply with two FOIA requests. In May 2025, we filed a FOIA request for the Justice Department’s contacts with Axios regarding the Biden-Hur audio recordings. We also had submitted a July 2025 FOIA request for the Justice Department’s communications with Axios pertaining to the investigation of Jeffrey Epstein.

We have been at the forefront of these investigations.

Regarding the Biden-Hur records, in March 2024, we filed the first FOIA lawsuit and were the lead plaintiff asking for the Special Counsel’s interviews of Biden (Judicial Watch, Inc. v. U.S. Department of Justice (No. 1:24-cv-00700)). In June 2024, the Justice Department admitted that the Special Counsel’s transcript was inaccurate.

Justice Department emails in a related case showed White House staffers suggesting edits to transcripts of Biden’s interview with Hur (Judicial Watch v. U.S. Department of Justice (No. 1:24-cv-02176)).

In May 2025, we forced the release of the audio recordings of Biden’s October 2023 interview with Hur. The recordings are available here: justice.gov/storage/Biden-interview-with-Hur-part-1-October-8th.mp3 and justice.gov/storage/Biden-interview-with-Hur-part-2-October-9th.mp3. In July 2025, we reached a settlement in which the government agreed to pay $10,000 for attorneys’ fees and other costs associated with the successful lawsuit that forced release of the audio tapes of Biden’s interview with Hur.

Regarding Jeffrey Epstein, in April 2025, we filed a FOIA lawsuit against the Justice Department for records on the identities of clients or associates of Epstein (Judicial Watch Inc. v. U.S. Department of Justice (No. 1:25-cv-01056)). In July, the Justice Department reported to the court that it was continuing to search for and review records, which is at odds with the leaked, unsigned and undated Justice Department/FBI memo that suggested no more Epstein records would be disclosed to the American public. The memo was first disclosed late on July 6.

We also sued in July for records related to Epstein’s victim Virginia Louise Giuffre.

Hundreds More Illegal Alien Gang Members, Murderers Arrested in Houston

Every town in America is now a border town, but Texas is at the frontier and facing some of the worst consequences of the Biden era’s open-door policy for illegal aliens. Our Corruption Chronicles blog reports.

Texas’s largest city appears to be a cesspool of undocumented criminals where just weeks after federal authorities announced the arrest of hundreds of violent gang members with a combined 1,700 criminal convictions, another 822 illegal immigrant offenders have been apprehended. This batch also includes gangbangers, convicted murderers, child predators, and other egregious criminals. In the last few weeks, during two separate operations, Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) revealed that it has taken more than 1,000 dangerous criminal aliens off the streets in Houston, Texas’s biggest city—and the nation’s fourth largest—with a population of around 2.4 million. The perpetrators rounded up in the first operation completed in early August entered the United States illegally a combined 1,400 times under the Biden administration’s disastrous open border policies that welcomed a record-breaking 7.6 million illegal aliens, including hundreds of thousands with serious criminal records and over 1.7 million from countries the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) says pose a national security threat to the U.S.

In an effort to mitigate the damage the Trump administration launched a nationwide initiative known as Operation Take Back America that aims to repel the invasion of illegal immigration and protect American communities from perpetrators of violent crimes. Cracking down on criminal aliens released throughout the nation under Biden is a key component of the effort and the administration assures it is targeting the “worst of the worst,” for arrest and removal even as most media outlets spin the narrative to focus exclusively on polices open border groups claim separate immigrant families and victimize hard-working migrants. The mainstream media ignored last month’s announcement involving ICE’s Houston operation even though it nabbed hundreds of illegal immigrants who are mostly members of violent gangs, including the renowned Mara Salvatrucha (MS-13), Tren de Aragua, Latin Kings, 15th Street Gang, Sureños, Paisas and Tango Blast and the majority of the perpetrators have been convicted of serious crimes such as homicide, sex trafficking, domestic violence, burglary, arson and unlawful possession of a firearm. The feds made it incredibly easy to report the story by providing mug shots and detailed criminal information of the worst offenders, illustrating the urgency to enforce immigration laws after four years of devastating open border policies.

As expected, the most recent Houston operation has also been disregarded by the media though it was just as alarming. In only a week ICE Enforcement and Removal Operations (ERO) arrested over 800 criminal aliens, many of them transnational gang members, with disturbing records. More than 320 of the offenders had previously been deported from the U.S. and 112 illegally reentered the country at least once after getting deported. “During the past four years, transnational gang members, foreign fugitives and other violent criminal aliens took advantage of the crisis at our southern border to illegally enter the country,” said Houston’s ICE ERO Director Gabriel Martinez in a statement issued by the agency a few days ago. “Many of them remained in the Houston area and have gone on to wreak havoc in our local communities.” Martinez added that the most recent weeklong operation focused on targeting those threats to public safety and resulted in the arrest of 822 illegal aliens, including five transnational gang members, seven child predators and three criminal aliens convicted of homicide-related offenses.

Here are a few examples of the criminal aliens arrested recently in Houston: Jorge Eliseo Torres-Soto, a 30-year-old child predator from Guatemala convicted of sexual assault of a child; William Alexander Telles Amaya, a 35-year-old from El Salvador convicted three times of child sex offenses, including aggravated sexual assault of a child, failure to register as a sex offender and sexual indecency with a minor; Cruz Leandro Martinez Leiva, a 25-year-old from El Salvador and MS-13 gang member convicted of robbery and armed carjacking; Carlos Vega-Ramirez, a 38-year-old Mexican deported from the U.S. twice and convicted of sexual indecency with a minor, enticement of a minor for indecent purposes, driving while intoxicated, fleeing police and forgery; Manuel Ivan Castillo Estrada, a 36-year-old child predator from Mexico deported from the U.S. three times and convicted of alien smuggling and sexually assaulting a minor; Francisco Eduardo Bonilla, a 37-year-old from El Salvador, convicted of sexual indecency with a minor; Alejandro Perez Miramontes, a 54-year-old Mexican deported from the U.S. 12 times and convicted eight times of illegal reentry and twice each of robbery, larceny and burglary as well as trespassing and evading arrest.

Defense Department Being Sued to Restore Kids’ Transgender Treatments

Three military families are suing the U.S. Department of Defense to reverse a provision in the 2024 National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA), signed by former President Biden, which bans Tricare from covering hormone therapy and puberty blockers for transgender minor children of service members. Our Corruption Chronicles blog explains:

Although the Defense Authorization Act signed by former President Biden blocks the U.S. Military’s healthcare system from providing specialized treatments to the transgender children of service members, three families are suing the Department of Defense (DOD) to reinstate the benefit, claiming they have been left with “significant”and “crushing out-of-pocket costs.” Leftist groups were outraged when the measure passed late last year andcalled on Biden to veto it because it bans the military’s Tricare Health Plan from covering gender-affirming care such as hormone therapy and puberty-suppressants to treat “gender dysphoria.” An analysis cited by the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU), a leader in the campaign opposing the military’s transgender healthcare ban, estimates that 2,500 minor patients receive care for gender dysphoria through Tricare and 900 get puberty-suppressants or gender-affirming hormones.

In their lawsuit against the DOD, military personnel with transgender children claim that Tricare’s sudden refusal to cover medically necessary care has inflicted profound harm and that plaintiffs’ families now face significant and crushing out-of-pocket costs. “This is not an abstract policy shift – it is an immediate and devastating disruption of essential health care that affects the physical and psychological well-being of plaintiffs and other young people throughout the country,” according to the complaint filed this month by two LGBTQ+ rights groups on behalf of the families. The transgender patients are not named to protect their privacy and are identified in the complaint as Diana Doe, Nathan Noe, and Parker Poe. The first two were taking hormones prescribed at Walter Reed National Military Medical Center in Maryland and were recently told by doctors that the treatments would no longer be covered under Tricare. The third plaintiff, Poe, is identified in the lawsuit as a young adult who has been taking testosterone covered by Tricare at an unnamed medical facility. Without Tricare coverage the testosterone prescription is “too expensive to purchase out-of-pocket,” the complaint states, adding that the “process has resulted in unnecessary stress and panic.”

Servicemembers and their families have been able to obtain puberty blockers or cross-sex hormone therapy for their transgender children through the military insurance for nearly a decade, one of the LGBTQ+ groups that filed the lawsuit writes in a statement that blames President Trump for ordering the DOD to terminate the essential care. “As a result of the Trump administration’s directive, the families’ trusted doctors cannot provide ongoing care and families are unfairly forced to take on this financial burden,” according to the group, which accuses the Trump administration of waging a relentless assault on transgender Americans and issuing a barrage of discriminatory executive orders designed to strip away their basic legal rights and deny them recognition. The reality is that the defense bill signed by Biden back in December 2024 bans gender-affirming care for transgender youth whose parents are active-duty military personnel. Leftist groups like the ACLU mounted a campaign to pressure Biden to veto the bill, but he signed it even though it prohibits insurance coverage for “medical interventions for the treatment of gender dysphoria,” including the hormone therapy and puberty-suppressants taken by the minors in this lawsuit.

Tricare has never covered the costly transgender sex change operations for adults but until recently provided hormone therapy and psychological counseling for gender dysphoria, which is identified by the plan as “psychological distress that results from an incongruence between one’s sex assigned at birth and one’s gender identity.” Before Trump’s second presidency, Tricare allowed active-duty service members to request a waiver for “medically necessary gender affirming surgery,” but the pricey operation was typically denied and two enlisted men who identify as women sued the DOD claiming the policy discriminates based on sex and transgender status. Less than a year ago, an Obama-appointed federal judge ruled in their favor, determining that the military’s health insurance plan is discriminatory and violates Equal Protection rights under the Fifth Amendment of the United States Constitution by failing to pay for gender transition surgeries, which the judge compared to mastectomies and hysterectomies due to cancer.

Published September 19, 2025

Renaissance Ranch, a ""Best in State"" family-owned provider, opens a faith-based treatment center in St. George, addressing men’s substance abuse and mental health struggles.

(PRUnderground) September 19th, 2025

Renaissance Ranch, a family-owned organization dedicated to addiction recovery, has opened a new residential substance abuse and mental health treatment facility for men in St. George, Utah. The Ranch is known for its award-winning, faith-based addiction recovery programs with inpatient and outpatient centers throughout Utah and Idaho.

The new St. George drug rehab offers detox, residential treatment, outpatient treatment, and sober living. Understanding that no two addictions are the same, the Ranch starts treatment with a consultation and builds a customized plan for each client. Participants move through the highly successful 12-step program and receive intensive individual and group counseling to address the issues at the root of their addiction. Graduates of the program can enjoy the lifetime support of the Ranch’s Band of Brothers, which is one of the country’s largest addiction recovery alumni programs for men.

The Ranch believes family involvement is the key to successful addiction recovery, so they also offer an addiction education program for family members, which includes webinars, classes, and family counseling.

The Ranch’s new St. George residential facility expands the organization’s footprint in Utah, complementing its existing outpatient program in the same city. The new faith-based treatment center reflects Renaissance Ranch’s commitment to meeting the growing demand for comprehensive addiction treatment services in southern Utah.

“Utah is a beautiful, family-friendly state with a deep commitment to religion, but it also has a significant substance abuse problem — and too many addictions go untreated. We are committed to cutting through the stigma surrounding addiction and helping individuals and families get the help they need. We are excited to be part of the solution through our beautiful new residential treatment center in St. George,” said Preston Dixon, COO of Renaissance Ranch.

Dixon is no stranger to addiction — he and his brother Tyson, who serves as CEO of the Ranch, both became addicted to drugs as teenagers. After addiction treatment centers transformed their lives, they, along with their parents, purchased the original Renaissance Ranch facility in Bluffdale, Utah, and dedicated themselves to helping others overcome the effects of addiction.

Renaissance Ranch has received Utah’s “Best of State” award for its addiction recovery centers. It accepts most insurances, including Tricare and Medicaid.

Yet today, many military families face frequent relocations and deployments that can disrupt services and jeopardize long-term outcomes for autistic children.

A new independent review by the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering and Medicine recognizes these gaps and provides strong recommendations to make TRICARE more responsive, less burdensome and better aligned with best practices for the autism community.

For over a decade, the Department of Defense (DoD) has offered autism therapy only through the temporary Comprehensive Autism Care Demonstration (ACD). During this time, applied behavior analysis (ABA), a well-established, evidence-based therapy, has been added as a basic health benefit to almost all other health care plans. However, TRICARE continues to exclude ABA as a permanent benefit, and instead has added barriers to accessing this therapy under ACD. While more than 35,000 beneficiaries rely on this program for ABA, families face uncertainty about its future, additional red tape and restrictions that limit access to proven care.

“The disruptions we experienced in receiving ABA services were extremely detrimental to my daughters’ ability to progress with their treatment goals and reduction in self-injurious behaviors,” shared Jennifer Penhale, Air Force spouse and mother to three children with autism. “Our family served the country with the promise from DoD that the most medically fragile and vulnerable of our military community would be taken care of, and we feel that promise has been broken.”

To improve care for TRICARE beneficiaries, the new report recommends that the DHA:

Cover ABA as a basic TRICARE benefit.

Eliminate requiring assessment tools and stress indices that add burden on families without improving care.

Give providers and families flexibility to tailor interventions to individual needs.

Align coverage with current standards of care and industry guidelines.

Establish an independent advisory council—including family members, providers and experts—to guide implementation and monitor delivery of ABA services.

Military families, providers and advocacy organizations like Autism Speaks have for years been raising concerns and advocating for TRICARE to cover ABA as a basic health care benefit.

It’s normal for kids to be sad or irritable or to have trouble paying attention or interacting with others at times. But sometimes, these feelings and behaviors are signs that your child could need mental health care.

“Your child’s mental health affects all aspects of their physical health and development,” said Thomas Turnbaugh, LCSW-C, a behavioral health specialist at the Defense Health Agency. “By knowing the signs of mental health problems in children and how to get help, you can help your child thrive.”

As a parent or caregiver, you play a critical role in recognizing when your child may be struggling. If your child needs help, you and your family members aren’t alone. Keep reading to learn how TRICARE can support your child’s mental health and find tips and resources for supporting your child’s well-being.

Signs of mental health challenges

Children can develop a variety of mental health conditions. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention:

Common mental health conditions that can be diagnosed in childhood are anxiety disorders, depressive disorders, and behavior disorders.

Symptoms for some conditions can start in early childhood. Symptoms for other conditions may start later in childhood or during the teenage years.

Signs of possible mental health problems in kids and teens can vary. They can be mild and brief or more serious and persistent. So, it’s important to know what to look out for.

According to the National Institute of Mental Health, younger kids may need help if they:

Have frequent tantrums or are intensely irritable much of the time

Often seem fearful or worried

Are in constant motion and can’t sit quietly (except when they’re watching videos or playing video games)

Sleep too much or too little, have frequent nightmares, or seem sleepy during the day

Aren’t interested in playing with other kids or have difficulty making friends

Struggle in school or have experienced a recent decline in grades

Older kids and teens may need help if they:

Have low energy, or sleep too much or too little

Have periods of highly elevated energy and activity

Spend more and more time alone and avoid social activities

Say that they think someone is trying to control their mind or that they hear things that other people can’t hear

Diet or exercise excessively or fear gaining weight

Smoke, drink, or use drugs

Engage in risky or destructive behavior alone or with friends

Engage in self-harm behaviors (such as cutting or burning their skin)

Have thoughts of suicide

If your child’s behavior is unsafe, or if your child talks about wanting to hurt themselves or others, get help immediately. If your child is struggling or having thoughts of suicide, call or text the 988 Suicide & Crisis Lifeline at 988 or chat at 988lifeline.org. In life-threatening situations, call 911.

How to get mental health care

Who can you turn to if your child is struggling? The NIMH recommends contacting a health care professional if your child’s behavioral signs and symptoms last weeks or months and they interfere with your child’s daily life at home and at school or with friends.

Your child’s primary care manager or primary care provider may be a good place to start. You can talk to their provider about your concerns, ask questions, and request a mental health screening. The NIMH has tips for talking to a provider about mental health. The provider may recommend that your child see a mental health professional.

Your child doesn’t need a referral or pre-authorization for most outpatient mental health care. They may be able to get mental health care through one or more of these options:

Military hospitals and clinics: Some military hospitals and clinics offer mental health services for kids and teens.

TRICARE network providers: You can make an appointment with a TRICARE network mental health provider no matter what health plan your child has. If you need help finding a provider, you can use the Find a Doctor tool or call your TRICARE regional contractor.

Virtual health: Your child may also be able to speak with a mental health professional by audio or video in the comfort of your home. Your military hospital or clinic may offer virtual mental health services. Additionally, your regional contractor has a network of virtual health providers.

Note: Your child may also be able to get mental health care from a TRICARE-authorized non-network provider. Be sure to follow your plan’s rules for getting care from non-network providers. Learn more about how to get mental health care with your plan.

Other ways to support your child’s well-being

There’s more to your child’s mental health than whether they have a mental health condition. It’s also about their well-being and ability to thrive, says the CDC. And children can experience mental health challenges even if they don’t have a mental health condition.

Here are other ways to support your child’s well-being:

Talk to your child. Ask how they’re doing and if there’s anything they want to talk about. Let your child know you care about them and want to help. Check out these tips for talking about mental health with your child.

Get nonmedical support. Your child may be able to get free, confidential counseling through Military OneSource or the Military and Family Life Counseling Program. Learn more about Military OneSource resources for kids and teens.

Remember that mental health is a vital part of your whole family’s health and well-being. If you’re struggling with your mental health, don’t be afraid to seek help.

NMCSD employs more than 5,000 active-duty military personnel, civilians, and contractors in southern California to deliver exceptional care afloat and ashore.","SAN DIEGO (April XX, 2025) – Lt. Erin N. Snyder, an emergency medicine physician at Naval Medical Center San Diego (NMCSD), was selected as a finalist in the Fourth Annual Young Investigator Competition hosted by the Clinical Investigations Program Office under the Defense Health Agency (DHA) Research and Engineering Directorate.

Lt. Snyder’s research, titled “Dimensions of a Ruler to Measure and Mark Donor Blood Bags to Reliably Fill to 450mL,”addresses a critical operational challenge in combat casualty care: the need for precise, reliable field methods to collect whole blood from walking blood bank donors in austere or forward environments.

“This work was driven by the need to support field medics and corpsmen who are providing life-saving care far from the safety and structure of a hospital,” said Snyder. “Being able to standardize a reliable way to fill donor blood bags to the proper volume with just a ruler and marker could reduce preventable deaths from hemorrhage, which remains the leading cause of battlefield mortality, as well as reduce complications and reduce the cognitive load on the end user.”

Snyder’s two-phase research project demonstrated that simple measurement tools—specifically, a marked ruler placed along the blood bag—could foster accurate blood volume collection to within ±10% of the 450mL target. This is critical due to the precise balance required between the blood volume and the citrate preservative in the bag. Underfilling risks citrate-induced hypocalcemia, while overfilling can result in clot formation and line blockage, both of which can compromise patient outcomes in the field.

“This research exemplifies the kind of pragmatic, mission-driven innovation that we need in military medicine,” said Capt. Nancy Miller, Director of Professional Education at NMCSD. “Lt. Snyder’s approach is resourceful, simple to implement, and directly supports warfighter survivability in the most challenging conditions.”

Snyder was selected as one of the top submissions – and the only U.S. Navy selectee – from among 35 finalists across the Army, Navy, and Air Force, whose research addressed a wide array of topics from surgical systems in space to fitness risk factors and trauma care innovations. The competition recognizes exceptional scientific inquiry and research with direct military relevance.

Her work is supported by the Combat Trauma Research Group – West and reflects NMCSD’s broader commitment to medical readiness and innovation.

Signs of mental health challenges

Children can develop a variety of mental health conditions. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention:

Common mental health conditions that can be diagnosed in childhood are anxiety disorders, depressive disorders, and behavior disorders.

Symptoms for some conditions can start in early childhood. Symptoms for other conditions may start later in childhood or during the teenage years.

Signs of possible mental health problems in kids and teens can vary. They can be mild and brief or more serious and persistent. So, it’s important to know what to look out for.

According to the National Institute of Mental Health, younger kids may need help if they:

Have frequent tantrums or are intensely irritable much of the time

Often seem fearful or worried

Are in constant motion and can’t sit quietly (except when they’re watching videos or playing video games)

Sleep too much or too little, have frequent nightmares, or seem sleepy during the day

Aren’t interested in playing with other kids or have difficulty making friends

Struggle in school or have experienced a recent decline in grades

Older kids and teens may need help if they:

Have low energy, or sleep too much or too little

Have periods of highly elevated energy and activity

Spend more and more time alone and avoid social activities

Say that they think someone is trying to control their mind or that they hear things that other people can’t hear

Diet or exercise excessively or fear gaining weight

Smoke, drink, or use drugs

Engage in risky or destructive behavior alone or with friends

Engage in self-harm behaviors (such as cutting or burning their skin)

Have thoughts of suicide

If your child’s behavior is unsafe, or if your child talks about wanting to hurt themselves or others, get help immediately. If your child is struggling or having thoughts of suicide, call or text the 988 Suicide & Crisis Lifeline at 988 or chat at 988lifeline.org. In life-threatening situations, call 911.

How to get mental health care

Who can you turn to if your child is struggling? The NIMH recommends contacting a health care professional if your child’s behavioral signs and symptoms last weeks or months and they interfere with your child’s daily life at home and at school or with friends.

Your child’s primary care manager or primary care provider may be a good place to start. You can talk to their provider about your concerns, ask questions, and request a mental health screening. The NIMH has tips for talking to a provider about mental health. The provider may recommend that your child see a mental health professional.

Your child doesn’t need a referral or pre-authorization for most outpatient mental health care. They may be able to get mental health care through one or more of these options:

Military hospitals and clinics: Some military hospitals and clinics offer mental health services for kids and teens.

TRICARE network providers: You can make an appointment with a TRICARE network mental health provider no matter what health plan your child has. If you need help finding a provider, you can use the Find a Doctor tool or call your TRICARE regional contractor.

Virtual health: Your child may also be able to speak with a mental health professional by audio or video in the comfort of your home. Your military hospital or clinic may offer virtual mental health services. Additionally, your regional contractor has a network of virtual health providers.

Note: Your child may also be able to get mental health care from a TRICARE-authorized non-network provider. Be sure to follow your plan’s rules for getting care from non-network providers. Learn more about how to get mental health care with your plan.

Other ways to support your child’s well-being

There’s more to your child’s mental health than whether they have a mental health condition. It’s also about their well-being and ability to thrive, says the CDC. And children can experience mental health challenges even if they don’t have a mental health condition.

Here are other ways to support your child’s well-being:

Talk to your child. Ask how they’re doing and if there’s anything they want to talk about. Let your child know you care about them and want to help. Check out these tips for talking about mental health with your child.

Balancing responsibilities at home, work, and in the community can sometimes make it difficult to address personal health needs — especially when it comes to substance use and mental health recovery. That’s where TRICARE West’s outpatient rehab coverage becomes a valuable resource.

Why Outpatient Rehab Matters for Military Families

Unlike inpatient treatment, which requires a full-time commitment away from home, outpatient programs allow individuals to maintain much of their daily routine. For many military families, this flexibility is critical. Parents can continue caring for children, spouses can keep working, and service members can meet professional obligations while still getting the structured treatment they need.

Outpatient care is not a “lighter” option but rather a tailored form of treatment that provides counseling, therapy, education, and accountability in a more adaptable schedule. With the right support system, this model helps clients gradually build healthier habits and long-term coping skills.

TRICARE West Coverage in Orange County

TRICARE West provides military families with access to outpatient rehab programs across the region. For those based in Orange County, this means the ability to find care close to home without having to navigate a confusing maze of options. Covered services typically include:

Individual and group therapy sessions to address both substance use and co-occurring mental health challenges.

Evidence-based treatment approaches such as cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) and motivational interviewing.

Medication-assisted treatment (when appropriate) to support safe and effective recovery.

Educational workshops and relapse prevention resources designed for lasting progress.

By working within the TRICARE network, military families can access these services with fewer financial concerns and more confidence in the quality of care provided.

Local Support with Asana Recovery

One trusted option in Orange County is Asana Recovery, a treatment center that partners with TRICARE West to deliver personalized outpatient care. Their programs are designed to fit into the lives of military families, offering structure without requiring long-term separation from loved ones.

Outpatient rehab offers the opportunity to heal without stepping away from life’s daily responsibilities, and TRICARE West makes that path more accessible for Orange County residents.

Whether someone is just beginning to explore treatment options or has already tried other approaches, outpatient care provides a chance to move forward with guidance, accountability, and compassion.

Acting DHA Director, Dr. David Smith, and DHA’s senior enlisted leader, Air Force Chief Master Sgt. Tanya Johnson, visited multiple clinics and sites across Joint Base San Antonio, underscoring the local healthcare system’s pivotal role in supporting the warfighter and caring for those who serve.

The health system is renowned for its extensive capabilities, boasting the only DOD Burn Center, Level I Trauma Center and rooftop helipad, as well as the largest medical facility in the Military Health System. It’s also the largest force-generating platform, hosting training for more than 700 military officers in 36 graduate medical education and 22 graduate allied health education specialty programs through the San Antonio Uniformed Services Health Education Consortium.

""SAMHS stands as a cornerstone of military medicine, providing unparalleled capabilities in trauma care, burn treatment, and medical education,"" said Air Force Maj. Gen. Thomas Harrell, director of Defense Health Network Central, and commander, Medical Readiness Command Alpha. ""Its unique combination of resources and expertise makes it an indispensable asset to our nation's defense and the well-being of our service members.""

During their visit to Brooke Army Medical Center, the leaders toured the emergency department, rooftop helipad, and the Institute of Surgical Research Burn Center, which is the only American Burn Association-verified burn center in South Texas. The BAMC ED serves as the entry point to its Level I Trauma Center, which administers care to civilian and military trauma patients from an area spanning 22 counties and approximately 2.2 million people.

This community trauma partnership is a “win-win” collaboration, Smith noted, as it provides world-class care to the community while enhancing the readiness of military medical personnel.

The next day, Smith and Johnson toured Wilford Hall Ambulatory Surgical Center and Reid Clinic, where Air Force basic military trainees were in-processing during week one of their training. Reid Clinic provides medical care to over 86,000 Air Force and Space Force basic military trainees and technical training students each year, highlighting the system's commitment to force generation and maintaining a healthy fighting force.

The DHA leaders also expressed interest in the DOD’s only extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) program. ECMO is a heart-lung bypass system that replaces the natural functions of the heart and lungs while treatments and healing of the affected organs take place. The joint-service ECMO team, based at BAMC, possesses the capability for global transports of warfighters, as well as the ability to transport civilian emergency patients through the Secretarial Designee program.

Another key stop was the Joint Trauma System, the DOD’s center of excellence for trauma care delivery. JTS supports combatant commands with trauma system planning, treatment and management. JTS also oversees DOD’s sole trauma patient registry, which collects comprehensive data on combat casualty care–from the point of injury to recovery–to improve outcomes and inform best practices.

Throughout the visit, Smith emphasized his commitment to understanding the challenges faced by the local system, including staffing, resource and budgetary challenges, and pledged to explore solutions from a senior leadership perspective to ensure the system can continue to meet its critical mission requirements.

""The San Antonio Military Health System's commitment to readiness and its ability to deliver comprehensive, world-class care is truly impressive,” Smith said. “We're here to listen, learn, and ensure our medical professionals have the resources and support they need to continue excelling in their vital mission. Their dedication to both the warfighter and the community is unwavering, and we are committed to supporting them in every way we can.""

Smith also recognized several exceptional personnel with coins, expressing his appreciation for their hard work and dedication to the mission of providing world-class healthcare and supporting military readiness.

Of note, the director presented a coin to Army Lt. Col. Adrianna Long, core faculty for the Emergency Medicine Residency at BAMC, for her efforts to augment the Emergency Operations Center after the catastrophic flooding along the Guadalupe River over the Fourth of July weekend. The flash floods claimed at least 135 lives in the Texas Hill Country.

A highlight of the visit was the director's congratulatory remarks to Carolyn Putnam, executive secretary to the BAMC commander, on her 90th birthday. Putnam, a BAMC institution with 70 years of civil service, has dedicated 65 of those years to the medical center.

The DHA leadership team noted they plan to use the insights gained from the visit to inform future strategies and initiatives aimed at strengthening the MHS and optimizing its support to the warfighter.

""We were honored to host Dr. Smith and Chief Master Sgt. Johnson and showcase the diverse capabilities and unwavering dedication of the San Antonio Military Health System,” Harrell said. “This visit provided a valuable opportunity to demonstrate how we contribute to military readiness, provide exceptional healthcare, and train the next generation of medical professionals.

“We appreciate senior leaders’ commitment to understanding our challenges and working collaboratively to ensure we continue to meet the evolving needs of our warfighters and beneficiaries with excellence,"" he added.",https://dha.mil/-/media/Project/Images/News-Images/9321793.jpg,N,1.0,2025-09-19 06:56:36.164552

No one takes better care of your career than you.” Source Minnesota National Guard (ngmnpublic.zurewebsesus).","At 43 years old, with a wife and three kids, Minnesota Army National Guard Chief Warrant Officer 2 (CW2) Patrick Kooiker returned to the Minnesota National Guard in 2021 after nearly a decade away from the military.

“The first time I joined the military I did it because all my friends were doing it,” said Kooiker, a network operation warrant officer. “This time, I joined for the benefits, especially TRICARE for Life and the Post 9/11 GI Bill, but mostly TRICARE for my kids.”

Kooiker, a Bayport resident, first served from 1995 to 2010. He spent two years with the army reserves and 13 years with the Minnesota Air National Guard’s Saint Paulbased 133rd Airlift Wing. He also served a one-year active-duty rotation with the National Guard Bureau.

“I was a key player in the restructuring of the mission for the Fargo, ND, unit to transition from an F-16 unit to a drone unit,” said Kooiker. “I also played a role in moving the B2 aircraft to Andersen Air Force Base.”

After reaching the rank of master sergeant, Kooiker transferred to the Individual Ready Reserve. There, he conducted contracting operations in Afghanistan and Kyrgyzstan before leaving the military in 2015.

A pivotal moment came when mentors Minnesota Army National Guard Colonel Carl Fassbender and Minnesota National Guard Command Chief Warrant Officer 5 Erik Homme recognized the value of Kooiker’s expertise and encouraged him to return to service. But, one obstacle held him back from serving. He did not meet the current height and weight requirements.

“I was 90 pounds overweight, Kooiker said. “I started walking, dieting, daily workouts, and I ran my life as though food was fuel.” Nothing was going to keep him from achieving his goal to serve again. Once he lost the extra weight, he was one step closer to rejoining.

By 2021, Kooiker saw that dream come true as he enlisted for the second time, this time as a soldier in the Minnesota Army National Guard.

“Patrick was appointed as a warrant officer in 2022 and quickly demonstrated a maturity and depth of knowledge comparable to our senior signal warrant officers,” Homme said. “He had over 15 years of army reserve and air national guard service prior, and he honed his IT/cyber skills at 3M and Securian during his break in service T ese experiences, coupled with his maturity and desire to mentor others were a perfect fit for the warrant officer corps and the Minnesota National Guard. His passion for the corps and deep IT/cyber kn wedge are ke t ur success n th a .” Not long after enlisting, Kooiker left for a second round of basic training. There, drill sergeants recognized his leadership and knowledge and allowed him to coach and mentor newer service members. “The drill sergeants trusted me to get things done at the barracks,” Kooiker said. “They would bring us back from dinner chow, and I would take charge of the formation and ensure they were in bed by eight and up by four.”

After graduating basic training, Kooiker attended the warrant officer basic course and became qualified as a network operations warrant officer, adding to the guard’s growing cyber capabilities and network oversight. Hs role as a warrant officer merges with his civilian career where he works in information technology and electronics engineering.

“I get to do things most will never experience,” said Kooiker. “Running cybersecurity exercises and simulating enemy attacks allows us to refine ou equipment, improve ou act cs and p epare s vi e member o defend our systems in rea world scen ios ”

Kooiker is working to bridge the gap between civilian expertise and military application. His ability to leverage knowledge gained in both sectors allows him to find areas for improvement and share best practices.

“CW2 Kooiker is a role model and champion for any noncommissioned officer considering becoming a warrant officer,” said Homme. “He fully supports our warrant officer candidate program through instruction, mentorship, and event participation. He readily helps others understand the networking that is used and goes out of his way to volunteer to teach classes and attend seminars that benefit other cyber teams at symposiums.”

His commitment to serve extends beyond the drill hall. Kooiker recently coordinated food and supplies for service members assigned to the guard’s cyber protection team who were responding to cyberattacks in St. Paul. He also dedicates time to the Minnesota National Guard Youth Camp, Memorial Day events, the Civil Air Patrol, and, with his wife, coaches their daughter’s special needs baseball team.

Driven by a desire to make a positive impact, Kooiker lives by the army values. He links the past and the future of the Minnesota National Guard, representing the next generation of cyber warriors. Though not new to military service, Kooiker is a rising leader, shaping others within the cyber community.

“Do as much as you can, as you never have enough time or money,” Kooiker said. “Start doing what you love now. No one takes better care of your career than you.”

The technology, developed by ActivArmor, uses additive manufacturing to create breathable casts and splints that allow for improved treatment options with fewer limitations on patients’ activities.

The waterproof casts offer several advantages over traditional fiberglass casts or plaster splints, according to U.S. Navy Cmdr. Kimberly Spahn, department head, Orthopedics, Naval Medical Center San Diego.

“You can swim in these and play sports, so they’re great for kids. They’re more hygienic. You can take them on and off so we avoid a lot of the skin breakdown we see with fiberglass and plaster casts,” Spahn said.

Spahn noted that the new casts are not appropriate for all orthopedic conditions, and traditional fiberglass or plaster casts remain an effective treatment in many cases, but if deemed appropriate by a medical provider, the waterproof casts can be especially useful for military service members, who can return to duty or training throughout the recovery process.

“It’s great for service members whose training involves water activities,” said Jill Eastin, business manager, Department of Orthopedics Surgery, Naval Medical Center San Diego. “They are able to still go out in the water and continue training in a way that isn’t possible with traditional casts.”

Each cast is custom-fit, allowing providers to make patient-specific modifications, such as amputated fingers or toes, metal pins or other surgical implants, and children with small limbs that don’t fit standard casts or splints, according to U.S. Navy Hospital Corpsman Petty Officer Third Class Danny Berroa Figueroa.

“It’s actually a really simple process. We just use the forward facing camera on a mobile device, and we will mark on the skin around bony areas or anything we don’t want to rub, and just scan someone’s arm or leg like that,” said Berroa Figueroa. “Once it’s good, we send it off to an engineer who analyzes it and figures out the best way to create the cast, they send back the guide file and we feed it into the machine to start printing.”

NMCSD is the second MTF to implement the technology, along with Walter Reed National Military Medical Center in Bethesda, Maryland, after ActivArmor received a $1.3 million competitive SBIR direct-to-phase II grant award from the Defense Health Agency. The award “will facilitate the deployment of ActivArmor systems to 11 military bases over 24 months,” according to the company’s website.

Doss Health Clinic (DDHC), is improving medical care for Soldiers through a digital transformation led by Staff Sgt. Crystal Wilkerson, the clinic’s noncommissioned officer in charge (NCOIC). The initiative has reduced wait times, eased administrative tasks and expanded access to medical services.

Wilkerson’s exceptional work deserved official recognition, thought Nora Aui, a registered nurse at DDHC. “I’d like to nominate, NCOIC of CAB, Staff Sgt. Wilkerson, on her innovative clinic initiatives,” wrote Aui. “She has taken the initiative to learn about, utilize the latest technology that the military offers us, and apply it to our clinic processes for packet submissions to increase availability to our service members.”

Starting in the summer of 2023, Wilkerson took the initiative to self-teach digital form creation and QR code generation, utilizing online resources to build a system that has dramatically altered clinic operations. The core of the transformation lies in the transition from paper-based requests to digital forms, accessible via QR codes and email. These codes are distributed to all units, including National Guard elements and those in remote locations, ensuring accessibility for all Soldiers.

“Too many Soldiers were making multiple trips to the clinic simply to request and submit paperwork,” Wilkerson said. “I saw an opportunity to leverage technology to alleviate that burden and free up both their time and our staff’s.”

The impact has been substantial. For flight physicals alone, the number of required clinic visits has been slashed from four to five to just two. Soldiers can now download, complete and submit packets remotely, a game-changer for those with demanding training schedules or geographic limitations. This same digital process has been successfully implemented for flight school, Officer Candidate School (OCS), warrant officer, and Standardized Electronic Enrollment Reporting (SEER) physicals, each presenting unique requirements and previously cumbersome procedures.

“We’ve seen at least a 50% reduction in required clinic visits for packet processes,” Wilkerson said. “Processing time for flight physicals has dropped from three weeks to as little as one week, depending on the patient's responsiveness.”

Beyond time savings, the digitization effort has yielded a host of benefits. Shorter check-in lines, reduced congestion at the front desk and a wider reach to Soldiers across diverse locations are all contributing to a more positive experience. The implementation of the digital systems for the CAB clinic has improved service delivery and minimized lost paperwork, resulting in enhanced communication.

The transition wasn't without its challenges. Wilkerson faced a learning curve in mastering the new technologies and navigating the complexities of designing branching logic within the digital forms to tailor questions based on individual needs. Successfully managing change within the clinic required a gradual implementation process and a willingness to incorporate feedback from staff and providers.

Looking ahead, Wilkerson’s vision extends beyond the CAB Clinic. She plans to expand these digital processes to all clinics under her purview, with a particular focus on school physicals and other routine paperwork. She also aims to proactively push forms directly to units, further accelerating processing times and improving Soldier readiness. Collaboration with web management is underway to ensure clinic websites accurately reflect current procedures, eliminating outdated information and guiding Soldiers to the most efficient pathways for care.

“These changes benefit our service members, the medical support assistants, the flight physical nurse and our medics,” Aui added in her nomination of Staff Sgt. Wilkerson. “She deserves recognition for all her hard work and the improvements made to CAB.”

Once orders are received, EFMP families should be allowed assignment to a new PCM at the receiving duty station.
This could allow EFMP families to get a head start without having to deal with the significant delays associated with awaiting PCM assignment when moving.
This would let providers at the current duty station connect families with counterparts at the new one seamlessly.
This solution augments the first two and could allow for PCM meetings with EFMP families via available telehealth options.","Moving to a new duty station is a hallmark of military life, but for families enrolled in the Department of Defense's Exceptional Family Member Program (also known as “EFMP”), which supports service members with dependents who have medical, educational, or developmental needs, the process can feel overwhelmingly complicated. As someone who has navigated these challenges firsthand, I know it's often far harder than it needs to be. Simple changes by the War Department and policy makers could make a big difference in easing the burden, improving the quality of life, and boosting retention rates among service members.

Timing is Everything

The core problem stems from timing. Many essential services for children or spouses with special needs can't begin until the family has a physical address at the new location. This includes therapies like Applied Behavior Analysis for autism, occupational therapy to build daily living skills, or speech therapy for communication challenges. These aren't quick fixes; they often involve long waitlists and evaluations that can stretch for months.

Education adds another layer of difficulty. Enrolling a child in a school that can accommodate an Individualized Education Program (also known as an “IEP”), a customized plan for students with disabilities, requires knowing if the local district has the right resources. Without advance information, families might end up in a neighborhood where the nearest suitable school is an hour away, as happened during my most recent move. I had been homeschooling my child for two years due to the pandemic, but waiting six months for an appropriate placement was still disruptive. While school systems fall outside the Defense Department's direct control, the ripple effects limit housing choices and force tough decisions, like becoming a ""geo-bachelor"" (living apart from family) or accepting suboptimal assignments to stay near support networks.

How to Fix it

These hurdles aren't just inconvenient; they strain relationships, finances, and careers. Service members may hesitate to take promotions or overseas tours if it means uprooting critical care. Fortunately, practical solutions exist that the military could implement to smooth transitions.

First, the military's health care system, TRICARE, should allow referrals for specialized services to be initiated before the move. Once orders are in hand, families could secure approvals remotely, reducing downtime upon arrival. The status quo means that nothing with the process can even start until the family has physically moved to the new duty station. This creates significant delays in beginning services.

Second, assigning a primary care manager (also referred to as a “PCM”), a key point of contact for medical needs, should happen prior to reporting to the new base. This would enable continuity of care without starting from scratch. As with the first item, this is currently a major constraint that delays services being initiated upon moving. Once orders are received, EFMP families should be allowed assignment to a new PCM at the receiving duty station. This could allow EFMP families to get a head start without having to deal with the significant delays associated with awaiting PCM assignment when moving.

Third, for ongoing treatments, initial referrals could shift to telehealth options, building on virtual care advancements made in recent years. This would let providers at the current duty station connect families with counterparts at the new one seamlessly. This solution augments the first two and could allow for PCM meetings with EFMP families via available telehealth options. Utilizing this functionality would help to potentially cut months of waiting time for services.

Finally, the EFMP could maintain up-to-date lists of therapy providers that accept TRICARE and have openings for new patients. Currently, families often discover dead ends after arrival, wasting precious time. Resources like the EFMP website could host these directories, perhaps integrated with tools from Military OneSource.

Implementing these changes wouldn't require overhauling the entire system. Some, like telehealth expansions, align with existing policies and could be piloted quickly. The payoff? Happier, healthier families who feel supported, leading to higher reenlistment rates and a stronger force overall. As the military competes for talent in a tight job market, prioritizing these improvements isn't just compassionate - it's strategic.

Hospice is a program of care and support if you’re terminally ill. The focus is on comfort, not on curing an illness.

TRICARE covers hospice care in the U.S. and U.S. territories if you get a referral and pre-authorization.

Some hospice care can be delivered in a hospital or nursing facility. But TRICARE also covers home hospice care. This includes:

Supportive services, including pain control and counseling services

Home health aide services

Personal comfort items

There are four levels of hospice care. Two can be delivered at home, including:

Continuous home care

Routine home care

What about TRICARE Pharmacy Home Delivery?

TRICARE Pharmacy Home Delivery is a convenient option for getting your long-term or maintenance medications delivered directly to your home. This program is managed by the TRICARE Pharmacy Program contractor, Express Scripts. This program offers:

90-day supplies for most maintenance medications

Free standard shipping

Automatic refill reminders

Lower out-of-pocket costs for some drugs

This benefit is available to all eligible TRICARE beneficiaries. This includes those with TFL, as described in the TRICARE Pharmacy Program Overview Fact Sheet. (Note: You aren’t eligible for the TRICARE Pharmacy Program if you have coverage through the US Family Health Plan.) Make sure a TRICARE-authorized provider writes your prescriptions and that the medications are on the TRICARE Formulary.

How to get started

Home health care: Talk to your provider. They’ll determine if you qualify and refer you to a TRICARE-authorized provider.

Hospice care: Discuss your options with your provider and request pre-authorization from your TRICARE contractor.

TRICARE Pharmacy Home Delivery: Register online or sign in to your Express Scripts account. You can transfer eligible prescriptions and set up pharmacy home delivery. (Note: You can also register by phone or mail. Visit How to Register for Home Delivery to learn more.)

Beneficiaries enrolled in Tricare Select plans usually don’t need a referral for specialty care.","Tricare Prime beneficiaries in the West Region should take note of a looming deadline for specialty care referrals to avoid paying out-of-pocket costs.

The deadline is Sept. 30 and applies to two types of referrals. This includes beneficiaries who have been receiving care under referrals issued during the special referral approval waiver period earlier this year. Those who used the waiver between Jan. 1 and June 30 and still need to continue seeing that specialist after Sept. 30 must obtain a new referral to a network specialist before Oct. 1, according to Tricare officials.

The second type of referral includes active referrals issued before Jan. 1 by the previous Tricare West Region contractor, Health Net Federal Services. These beneficiaries can continue to see the specialist listed on the referral through its expiration date or Sept. 30, whichever comes first.

Tricare Prime beneficiaries who require specialty care after Sept. 30 must contact their primary care manager to receive the new referral for their specialist. Starting Oct. 1, point-of-service fees may apply to those who see a specialist who isn’t in the Tricare network.

TriWest Healthcare Alliance, the West Region contractor, requires processing time to approve a new referral, so Defense Health Agency officials are encouraging beneficiaries to take action now.

The referral approval waivers were implemented earlier this year to help ease the problems families had been experiencing since TriWest took over the West Region contract at the start of the year. One issue was that Tricare Prime families hadn’t been able to get referrals approved by TriWest, which is traditionally required before Tricare Prime beneficiaries can receive specialty care.

“If you live in the West Region, it’s important that you take the time now to evaluate your current referrals,” said Jacob Sanchez, referral management subject expert for Tricare, in the Tricare announcement about the deadline. “Work with your primary care manager and plan ahead for specialty care you may need starting Oct. 1.”

That’s why the TRICARE Dental Program covers two routine dental cleanings and examinations each year.

“Regular dental care isn’t just about having a nice smile, it’s about protecting your overall health, so you can avoid bigger issues down the road,” said Douglas Elsesser, a program analyst with the Dental Program Branch of the TRICARE Health Plan at the Defense Health Agency.

Prevention is the best medicine

Preventive dental care is important, even if you’re brushing and flossing every day just like you’re supposed to. Your mouth is constantly dealing with bacteria, sugars, and acids from eating and drinking throughout the day. Despite your best efforts, plaque and tartar can build up in hard-to-reach spaces on your teeth and gums.

Plaque is a sticky film that constantly forms on teeth. If not removed, it hardens into tartar, which can cause:

Cavities. The acids in plaque erode your tooth enamel (the outer covering of your tooth).

Gum disease (gingivitis & periodontitis).

Plaque irritates your gums, leading to inflammation. Untreated gingivitis can lead to periodontitis, which is an infection of the gums that may damage the soft tissue and the bones supporting your teeth.

When you go to the dentist, a professional cleaning will remove plaque and tartar and they’ll also be able to identify early signs of trouble ranging from gingivitis to oral cancer.

Gum disease and overall health

According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, gum disease doesn’t just affect the state of your oral health, but also the overall health of your body. For example, gingivitis or periodontitis can make blood sugar harder to control for people who have diabetes. Some studies show there may also be a link between poor oral health and having a number of chronic health conditions.

Get even more from your TDP dental plan! If you’re pregnant or have a qualifying chronic condition, you could get extra benefits. Visit the TDP website to find out about the TDP Wellness Program and how it can give you more dental care at no added cost.

Getting the most out of the TDP

Between brushing twice a day for two minutes and flossing once a day, your oral health care routine may take only five minutes out of your whole day. When you put that into perspective, it’s amazing how only five minutes out of your day, can not only keep your body healthy, but it can also save you thousands of dollars.

By taking advantage of your TDP benefit, you can:

Prevent health problems. Regular cleanings prevent cavities and gum disease, keeping your mouth and body healthy, and it also allows your dentist the opportunity to notice other health concerns.

Save time and money. Addressing dental issues early on is always less expensive and time-consuming than dealing with advanced problems requiring extensive treatment. Preventive care can stop things before they start.

Maintain a bright smile. Professional cleanings not only remove plaque and tartar but also polish your teeth, leaving you with a brighter, healthier-looking smile.",https://www.militaryspot.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/tricare-dental.png,N,1.0,2025-09-17 17:59:47.234667

Here are some ways that resilience supports personal readiness and promotes warfighter lethality.
Resilience: An X-factor in warfighter lethality and personal readiness Enhancing situational awareness: Combat environments are often intense; stress and anxiety can cloud judgment and narrow focus.
Physical resilience supports mental resilience.
To maintain personal readiness, resilience involves not only the capacity to rebound from setbacks but also sustainable and flexible abilities, referred to as adaptive resilience.","Richard Barton, who retired from the U.S Army in 2012, holds a doctorate in clinical social work, has served as a U.S. Army brigade behavioral health officer, and as chief of social work services while assigned to Fort Sill, Oklahoma. His primary focus at Defense Health Agency-Public Health is on behavioral health and suicide prevention.

While lethality is often connected with firepower and tactical know-how, there is a human component that supports warfighter lethality and readiness: resilience. For service members, resilience is not only about bouncing back; it’s about developing mental flexibility, having the ability to regulate emotions, and maintaining focus under stressful situations that enhance individual readiness. Here are some ways that resilience supports personal readiness and promotes warfighter lethality.

The Department of Defense defines personal readiness as the ability to perform effectively and efficiently in all aspects of life, particularly in military contexts. This includes five dimensions of personal readiness:

Physical: Maintaining a healthy lifestyle, including proper nutrition and exercise

Emotional: Recognizing and managing emotions, including resilience to handle stress and adversity

Social: Building and maintaining strong relationships, both personally and professionally

Spiritual: Cultivating a sense of purpose and personal values that guide one's actions and decisions

Family: Supporting and maintaining healthy relationships within the family unit

These dimensions are essential for sustaining personal readiness and overall well-being.

Resilience: An X-factor in warfighter lethality and personal readiness

Enhancing situational awareness:

Combat environments are often intense; stress and anxiety can cloud judgment and narrow focus. However, resiliency can help leaders and their warfighters better manage natural stress responses, improve awareness levels, and develop an ability to make quicker and more accurate decisions under duress. Enhancing individual resiliency improves situational awareness and supports personal readiness.

Optimizing performance under pressure:

When in a combat situation, stress hormones surge, triggering many biological changes. Realistic operational training helps to optimize personal readiness and resilience by providing leaders and warfighters opportunities to successfully manage their responses and channel them effectively, supporting their ability to maintain composure, stay focused, and utilize fine motor skills during intense situations.

Learning rapid recovery and adaptation:

The combat environment is dynamic. Challenging training scenarios help leaders and warfighters learn from their failures and adapt in rapidly evolving situations. Resiliency is enhanced by exposure to uncomfortable training environments, which helps promote learning how to recover from setbacks and overcome complex challenges. Learning to think critically and quickly adapt to new situations are keys to mission success.

Sustaining the will to fight on:

Learning to be comfortable with discomfort helps to provide a firm sense of purpose and determination when facing physical and mental hardships. Physical resilience supports mental resilience. The ability to think clearly and adjust to the effects of an intense operational tempo is influenced by individual levels of physical fitness; a fit body supports personal readiness.

Cohesion supports resiliency:

Resilience can be contagious. A team composed of resilient individuals is more likely to sustain its cohesion, develop trust, and maintain morale in extreme circumstances. Team cohesion can translate into seamless teamwork, effective communication, and a shared commitment to accomplishing the mission, ultimately increasing the team’s readiness.

To maintain personal readiness, resilience involves not only the capacity to rebound from setbacks but also sustainable and flexible abilities, referred to as adaptive resilience. Likewise, resilience is not based on a single strength. Here are some examples of how units develop and maintain resilience:

U.S. Navy SEALs and submarine crews demonstrate adaptive resilience through extended underwater deployments, where they must manage isolation, confined spaces, and make mission-critical decisions under extreme pressure.

Pilots and aircrew develop resilience through high-altitude training and split-second, decision-making scenarios where maintaining focus and fine motor skills can mean the difference between mission success and failure.

U.S. Marine Corps units exemplify resilience through amphibious assault training, where they must rapidly adapt from sea-based operations to ground combat while maintaining unit cohesion across diverse operational environments.

U.S. Space Force operators build resilience through training in cyber-warfare simulations and satellite operations, where mental agility and emotional regulation are crucial for protecting national security infrastructure.

U.S. Army medics develop adaptive resilience through high-stress medical simulation training that replicates the chaos of battlefield casualty care, where they learn to optimize performance under pressure.

The foundations of resilience are established during initial training, optimized further by the challenges faced during the duty day, in reality-based training, and during deployments. Those who develop adaptive resilience are better equipped with the behavioral and physical traits needed to overcome challenging conditions and events.

A resilient force is a lethal force. By cultivating resilience as a core competency, we not only enhance our well-being but also improve the readiness and lethality of our military.

Three-pronged approach to injury prevention The DHA-PH ergonomics team accomplishes its mission through three primary focus areas: design reviews, worksite assessments, and training and education initiatives.

In some cases, an ergonomics team member will virtually attend regularly scheduled SOH meetings, said Lauren Costanzi, DHA-PH ergonomist.","Musculoskeletal injuries represent a significant challenge for military readiness, accounting for roughly 95% of all military injuries and serving as the leading cause of medical visits, limited duty, and medical discharges across the armed forces.

To combat this pervasive threat to force readiness, the Defense Health Agency-Public Health ergonomics program within the Occupational Health Sciences directorate at Aberdeen Proving Ground, Maryland, takes a comprehensive approach that recognizes optimal human performance as critical to mission success.

""The program recognizes that ergonomic design is both a force protection and force-multiplication strategy,"" said Steven Chervak, a DHA-PH ergonomist. ""We aim to enhance warfighter performance, health, and safety by integrating ergonomic and human factors principles into military systems, equipment, and operations to reduce injury risk and optimize human-system performance.""

The primary goals of the ergonomics and human factors field are to reduce human error, increase productivity and efficiency, enhance safety, and reduce exposure to work-related musculoskeletal disorder risk factors, said John Pentikis, DHA-PH Ergonomics Branch manager.

Three-pronged approach to injury prevention

The DHA-PH ergonomics team accomplishes its mission through three primary focus areas: design reviews, worksite assessments, and training and education initiatives.

Design reviews, frequently conducted through the health hazard assessment process, aim to incorporate ergonomic principles into the acquisition process to ensure purchased or developed equipment is designed for optimal human performance prior to fielding.

“This proactive approach allows the team to identify and address potential injury risks before equipment reaches service members,” said Chervak.

Worksite assessments use job hazard analysis and biomechanical assessment techniques to optimize performance by improving human-machine interaction. These assessments focus on reducing ergonomic risk factors such as excessive force generation, repetitive motions, and exposure to vibration while optimizing posture for various military tasks, said Chervak.

“We assess a wide variety of work environments, including military hospitals and clinics, clinical care and laboratory settings, laundry and dining services, and industrial environments from cable assembly to paint booths and vehicle maintenance,” said Pentikis. “We also assess musculoskeletal-specific tasks such as weapons loading, litter carrying, parachute rigging, and load carriage.”

The training and education component involves multiple audiences, from teaching occupational health and safety personnel to perform worksite assessments to instructing service members on proper lifting and material handling techniques, said Chervak. The program also provides equipment-specific and site-specific training while educating leadership on ergonomic principles.

“For example, the ergonomics program recently developed specific ergonomic trainings in the areas of dining services, vehicle mechanics, emergency medical technicians, laboratories, and health care environments at the request of customers,” said Chervak.

The ergonomics team continually assesses ergonomics concerns as new equipment is developed.

“There are always new patient care environments, equipment, and circumstances to be assessed for safe patient handling and mobility, and the majority of work environments across the military place workers and military members at some level of musculoskeletal disorder risk,” said Kelsey McCoskey, a DHA-PH ergonomist. “Each time a depot mission changes, and a new system or equipment is being built or refurbished, the ergonomic risk factors change. Helping the local safety and occupational health personnel to continuously identify, prioritize, and remediate these work-related musculoskeletal risks is part of our mission.”

Real-world impact on military operations

Recent ergonomics evaluations have highlighted the direct impact our program can have on service members’ lethality, readiness, and equipment development, said Chervak.

""Studies have established a link between exposure to high levels of whole-body vibration and slowed reaction times,” said Chervak. “In combat scenarios, this delay can be the difference between life and death, especially when rapidly exiting a vehicle and returning fire. However, until now, the levels of whole-body vibration experienced by service members operating in military vehicles during realistic training and operational environments remained largely unknown.”

To address this critical knowledge gap, Chervak and McCoskey collaborated with the National Guard Bureau’s Office of the Joint Surgeon to pilot whole-body vibration exposure data collection on opposing force military vehicles during a recent Operation Northern Strike training exercise. This effort provides crucial data towards characterizing the whole-body vibration exposure soldiers face on missions, said Chervak.

“Additionally, it offers invaluable insights for optimizing future data gathering, allowing us to focus on targeted vehicle types, smaller exercises, and leveraging schoolhouse opportunities to develop a robust soldier vibration exposure algorithm,” said Chervak. “Ultimately, these evaluations aim to inform the development of vehicle designs and operational strategies that minimize vibration exposure, thereby enhancing service member lethality, protecting readiness, and optimizing mission success.

The team has also done whole-body vibration exposure studies with rotary wing aircrews.

""A recent evaluation of whole-body vibration exposure among a select group of rotary wing aircrew by the ergonomics group has led to further investigations by the program managers, structural engineers, and manufacturers of the aircraft to determine methodologies for reducing vibration exposures within the aircraft,"" said Chervak.

The ergonomics team is also at the forefront of emerging technology assessment, particularly in evaluating exoskeletons for military applications, said Kevin Purcell, DHA-PH ergonomist. Currently, the ergonomics program is collaborating with endoscopy surgeons at Walter Reed National Military Medical Center in Bethesda, Maryland, to determine whether exoskeleton technology can reduce lower back and shoulder muscle fatigue during medical procedures.

""Exoskeletons hold promise for improving ergonomics and reducing the risk of injuries in workplaces with physically demanding tasks,"" said Purcell. ""However, they need to be implemented in the proper settings that carefully consider both the potential benefits and drawbacks, focusing on user-centered design, proper fitting, and thorough assessment in real-world work environments to maximize their effectiveness and minimize potential risks.""

The Walter Reed project uses Surface-Electromyography, or sEMG, to measure muscle activity during simulated endoscopy tasks performed with and without exoskeletons, said Purcell. This process captures muscle activation signals noninvasively through electrodes placed on the skin over target muscles and provides objective data on the technology's effectiveness in reducing muscle activity.

Customer-driven investigations

The ergonomics team determines focus areas through both systematic processes and direct customer requests. Design reviews are coordinated through the HHA process, where the team receives assignments to review specific equipment for ergonomic risk factors including material handling requirements, force requirements, and vibration exposure.

""Work environment, job hazard analysis evaluations, training, and education initiatives are usually customer driven,"" said Chervak. ""We are either contacted by a unit directly or through a safety and occupational health professional who is responsible for the unit.""

Service members and units can request assistance through the ergonomics website by completing DHA Form 435 [right click to download], or by contacting the team directly. The team works to route requests through appropriate channels to begin direct collaboration with requesting units.

Targeting work-related musculoskeletal disorders

The ergonomics program specifically targets work-related musculoskeletal disorders which include various types of overuse injuries resulting from repetitive stress or excessive use without adequate recovery time, said Chervak. In military settings, these injuries often blur traditional workplace injury definitions.

""Overuse injuries are a part of work-related musculoskeletal disorders because they result from repetitive stress or excessive use without adequate recovery time,"" said Chervak.

Examples of some disorders commonly linked to ergonomic risk factors are musculoskeletal injury to tendons, ligaments, muscles, and joints; degenerative disc disease; herniated discs; pinched nerves; and carpal tunnel syndrome, said Chervak. Specific examples of military-related overuse injuries include rotator cuff injuries prevalent among parachute riggers, and back injuries from lifting mortar shells.

Data-driven approach to prevention

To identify emerging trends and prioritize interventions, the ergonomics team collaborates closely with the DHA-PH’s Injury Prevention Branch, which is part of the Clinical Public Health and Epidemiology directorate, also located at Aberdeen Proving Ground, said Chervak. The Injury Prevention Branch tracks injury trends and uses the Force Risk Reduction management and analysis tool which is managed by the U.S. Army Combat Readiness Center at Fort Rucker, Alabama, to recognize patterns and emerging issues across military installations.

FR2 is available to individuals in the SOH community and human resources community with a government-issued CAC and a .mil email address.

Accessing ergonomic support

Multiple pathways of assistance are available for service members experiencing ergonomic concerns. The primary recommendation is to contact local safety officers, industrial hygienists, or occupational health specialists, who serve as the first line of defense for addressing ergonomic issues, said Chervak.

""If your local team cannot resolve the issue internally or needs additional expertise, they will escalate the matter to our specialized team for advanced assessment and solutions,"" said Chervak. “You can also contact us directly if you prefer or if the situation requires immediate attention. We'll work collaboratively with you and your local SOH team.”

The ergonomics program also develops strategic partnerships with installation SOH personnel. In some cases, an ergonomics team member will virtually attend regularly scheduled SOH meetings, said Lauren Costanzi, DHA-PH ergonomist.

One example of the benefits of this type of collaboration is an effort related to the assembly of a fabric military battery pouch. The SOH office had identified the task as being physically difficult to perform and causing hand and wrist injuries, said Costanzi. The pouch is sewn inside out, which requires it to be flipped right side out prior to shipment. This task requires high-hand forces due to the inflexibility of the stiff fabric. DHA-PH ergonomists measured the forces required to manipulate the battery pouch by using a force gauge to push the corners of the pouch into position. The gauge recorded the peak push force as 42 pounds.

“Ergonomists investigated the use of a home-grade steamer to soften the battery pouch fabric,” said Costanzi. “Softening the fabric reduced the push/pull forces required to manipulate the fabric from inside out to right-side out. Subsequent manipulation of the pouch to turn it right side out resulted in maximum pulling force of 10 pounds, which represents a 67% decrease in the amount of force needed to manipulate the battery pouch.”

Strategic partnerships and standards development

Beyond direct service delivery, the DHA-PH ergonomics program maintains strategic partnerships with professional organizations and standards committees to influence policies affecting military operations, said Chervak. The team actively collaborates with the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs Veterans Health Agency Safe Patient Handling and Mobility and ergonomics programs, the Maryland National Guard, and participates in safe patient handling organizations, human vibration exposure technical advisory groups, and exoskeleton standards committees.

“These partnerships ensure the military can shape standards rather than simply comply with them, preventing increased procurement costs while protecting service member health through proactive engagement in policy development,” said Chervak.

The program also provides digital support to U.S. Army and Department of Defense end users through educational materials, fact sheets, policy guidance, professional publications, and regular updates to military ergonomics guidance documents.

Future of drone warfare Navy Capt.","SEPTEMBER 17, 2025 – The 2025 Military Health System Research Symposium featured an in-depth plenary panel on “Drone Warfare and the New Resilience Paradigm” Aug. 4, featuring speakers from Ukraine’s military health system, the Walter Reed Army Institute of Research, the United States Indo-Pacific Command, the Defense Health Agency’s Joint Trauma System, and civilian health care organizations.

Dr. Terry Rauch, director of research and development for the Office of the Assistant Secretary of War for Health Affairs, moderated the panel with Army Col. (Dr.) John Holcomb, professor of surgery at the Uniformed Services University, Bethesda, Maryland.

“As professional scientists and innovators, we’re tasked with preparing for the evolving character of war,” said Holcomb. He noted that millions of drones are in production, with thousands already flying.

Evolving physical threats

Ukrainian armed forces Col. (Dr.) Kostiantyn Gumeniuk, chief surgeon for medical forces, said expensive armored equipment can be disabled by drones. He noted today’s Ukrainian medics now treat amputations, severe tissue damage, and burns from missiles, chemical weapons, and drones — urging researchers to address more severe injuries.

“Today’s war is a war of drones, so we need to develop a new surgical tactic for these kinds of injuries,” he said.

Ukrainian Maj. (Dr.) Dmytro Samofalov, acting head of the health department, Ministry of Defense of Ukraine, added that drones are changing the geography of war — putting civilians, ambulances, and hospitals at risk. He shared examples where civilian ambulances, drivers, and paramedics have been targeted and struck by enemy drones.

He said, “Even being [away from the] frontlines, you are still not safe. A lot of our military guys who [have been] in [secure] positions who thought they were safe [have been] wounded by drones.”

Psychological toll

Dr. Oleh Berezyuk, director, psychological direction and psychosocial rehabilitation, Unbroken, First Medical Union Hospital Lviv, Ukraine, described the “sharp, drastic increase in military and civilian personnel suffering from psychological effects of drone warfare”. He said that 70% of patients are reporting signs of burnout, 38% have posttraumatic stress disorder, and 11% have suicidal ideation.

Dr. Amy Adler, clinical research psychologist and senior scientist with WRAIR’s Center for Military Psychiatry and Neuroscience in Silver Spring, Maryland, noted acute stress reactions, or “freezing” in action, are a “normal, understandable response to a traumatic stressor” likely to increase with the growing threat of drone attacks.

Adler identified a peer-support tool called “iCOVER” developed by WRAIR and the Israeli Defense Forces. The tool helps teammates guide someone through a reaction by naming “what [has] happened, what is happening, what will happen,” she said, before requesting a simple action to break paralysis. She emphasized that this is one of many tools in development designed to support the psychological health of warfighters and providers facing mounting drone threats.

Future of drone warfare

Navy Capt. (Dr.) Peter Roberts, command surgeon, USINDOPACOM, explained that drones could be vital for biothreat surveillance, battle damage assessment, and sea-to-shore kit delivery. However, he urged researchers to address limitations due to cost concerns, payload and range restrictions, autonomy, and weather resilience.

Panelists agreed on several priorities to prepare warfighters and mitigate the impact of drone warfare:

Improve training, including advanced trauma life support for medics managing complex battlefield injuries

Better prepare for attacks on non-combatant targets as drones slip past the frontlines of conflict

Prioritize mental health, by offering real-time counseling on the frontlines and better training in diagnosis, stress management, and self-regulation

Simulate realistic stressors during training

Army Col. (Dr.) Jennifer Gurney, chief, DHA’s Joint Trauma System, emphasized that “technology will indeed punish the unskilled on the next battlefield.” She also encouraged participants to study resilience, saying, “How can we come home stronger? Saving lives with your team makes you stronger.”",https://www.militaryspot.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/drone-impact-on-health.png,N,0.0,2025-09-17 15:56:08.911763

Getting your Trinity Audio player ready...

By Mike Causey

Whether you’re active duty, a reservist or a military family member, choosing the right health or life insurance plans can feel like you are navigating a minefield. Here are some things to consider before signing on the dotted line.

Health insurance

If you are on active duty for more than 30 days, good news: You and your dependents should be covered by military health care. But here’s the fine print:

Dependents can access medical and dental care at military facilities. Availability may vary.

TRICARE offers civilian health benefits funded by the federal government. Your military unit can help with the details.

If you’re leaving a civilian job for military service, federal laws like COBRA (the Consolidated Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act) and USERRA (the Uniformed Services Employment and Reemployment Rights Act of 1994) protect your right to continue employer-based health coverage for up to 24 months.

If your service is for 30 days or less, you’ll pay the same rate you previously paid. If it’s longer, you may need to cover the full premium plus a 2% administration fee.

If you’ve lost coverage through your employer, thanks to HIPPA (the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act), you might qualify to enroll in your spouse’s group health plan. But don’t wait. Time limits apply.

Life insurance

Before buying life insurance, especially on base, make sure the agent is legit:

They need permission from the Department of Defense to sell on military installations.

They must be licensed by the Department of Insurance. Ask to see the agent’s permits and licenses to be sure the agent is legitimate.

Many private insurance carriers do not offer coverage for acts of war. But SGLI – the Service Members’ Group Life Insurance program – has your back. It’s affordable and includes coverage for death due to acts of war.

If you have coverage elsewhere, double-check with your agent to avoid overlapping policies. You might be paying for insurance coverage you already have.

Acting DHA Director, Dr. David Smith, and DHA’s senior enlisted leader, Air Force Chief Master Sgt. Tanya Johnson, visited multiple clinics and sites across Joint Base San Antonio, underscoring the local healthcare system’s pivotal role in supporting the warfighter and caring for those who serve.

The health system is renowned for its extensive capabilities, boasting the only DoD Burn Center, Level I Trauma Center and rooftop helipad, as well as the largest medical facility in the Military Health System. It’s also the largest force-generating platform, hosting training for more than 700 military officers in 36 graduate medical education and 22 graduate allied health education specialty programs through the San Antonio Uniformed Services Health Education Consortium.

""SAMHS stands as a cornerstone of military medicine, providing unparalleled capabilities in trauma care, burn treatment, and medical education,"" said Air Force Maj. Gen. Thomas Harrell, director of Defense Health Network Central, and commander, Medical Readiness Command Alpha. ""Its unique combination of resources and expertise makes it an indispensable asset to our nation's defense and the well-being of our service members.""

During their visit to Brooke Army Medical Center, the leaders toured the emergency department, rooftop helipad, and the Institute of Surgical Research Burn Center, which is the only American Burn Association-verified burn center in South Texas. The BAMC ED serves as the entry point to its Level I Trauma Center, which administers care to civilian and military trauma patients from an area spanning 22 counties and approximately 2.2 million people.

This community trauma partnership is a “win-win” collaboration, Smith noted, as it provides world-class care to the community while enhancing the readiness of military medical personnel.

The next day, Smith and Johnson toured Wilford Hall Ambulatory Surgical Center and Reid Clinic, where Air Force basic military trainees were in-processing during week one of their training. Reid Clinic provides medical care to over 86,000 Air Force and Space Force basic military trainees and technical training students each year, highlighting the system's commitment to force generation and maintaining a healthy fighting force.

The DHA leaders also expressed interest in the DoD’s only extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) program. ECMO is a heart-lung bypass system that replaces the natural functions of the heart and lungs while treatments and healing of the affected organs take place. The joint-service ECMO team, based at BAMC, possesses the capability for global transports of warfighters, as well as the ability to transport civilian emergency patients through the Secretarial Designee program.

Another key stop was the Joint Trauma System, the DoD’s center of excellence for trauma care delivery. JTS supports combatant commands with trauma system planning, treatment and management. JTS also oversees DoD’s sole trauma patient registry, which collects comprehensive data on combat casualty care -- from the point of injury to recovery – to improve outcomes and inform best practices.

Throughout the visit, Smith emphasized his commitment to understanding the challenges faced by the local system, including staffing, resource and budgetary challenges, and pledged to explore solutions from a senior leadership perspective to ensure the system can continue to meet its critical mission requirements.

""The San Antonio Military Health System's commitment to readiness and its ability to deliver comprehensive, world-class care is truly impressive,” Smith said. “We're here to listen, learn, and ensure our medical professionals have the resources and support they need to continue excelling in their vital mission. Their dedication to both the warfighter and the community is unwavering, and we are committed to supporting them in every way we can.""

Smith also recognized several exceptional personnel with coins, expressing his appreciation for their hard work and dedication to the mission of providing world-class healthcare and supporting military readiness.

Of note, the director presented a coin to Army Lt. Col. Adrianna Long, core faculty for the Emergency Medicine Residency at BAMC, for her efforts to augment the Emergency Operations Center after the catastrophic flooding along the Guadalupe River over the Fourth of July weekend. The flash floods claimed at least 135 lives in the Texas Hill Country.

A highlight of the visit was the director's congratulatory remarks to Carolyn Putnam, executive secretary to the BAMC commander, on her 90th birthday. Putnam, a BAMC institution with 70 years of civil service, has dedicated 65 of those years to the medical center.

The DHA leadership team noted they plan to use the insights gained from the visit to inform future strategies and initiatives aimed at strengthening the MHS and optimizing its support to the warfighter.

""We were honored to host Dr. Smith and Chief Master Sgt. Johnson and showcase the diverse capabilities and unwavering dedication of the San Antonio Military Health System,” Harrell said. “This visit provided a valuable opportunity to demonstrate how we contribute to military readiness, provide exceptional healthcare, and train the next generation of medical professionals.

“We appreciate senior leaders’ commitment to understanding our challenges and working collaboratively to ensure we continue to meet the evolving needs of our warfighters and beneficiaries with excellence,"" he added.",https://d1ldvf68ux039x.cloudfront.net/thumbs/photos/2509/9321793/1000w_q95.jpg,N,0.0,2025-09-17 15:56:16.523660

Conclusion: A Defensive Play in a High-Growth Sector Senzime's strategic alignment with U.S. defense healthcare innovation offers a unique blend of revenue security and growth potential.
As the DoD and civilian healthcare systems continue to prioritize patient safety, Senzime's TetraGraph system stands as a testament to the power of defensive innovation in an increasingly complex healthcare landscape.","In the evolving landscape of healthcare technology, Senzime AB has emerged as a pivotal player in neuromuscular monitoring, leveraging its proprietary TetraGraph system to redefine patient safety standards. The company's recent foray into U.S. defense healthcare, marked by a contract with the Department of Defense (DoD) and Walter Reed National Military Medical Center, underscores its strategic pivot toward contract-driven revenue security and alignment with national defense priorities. This move not only solidifies Senzime's market position but also positions it as a beneficiary of the U.S. military's push for advanced medical technologies.

Defensive Healthcare Innovation: A Gold Standard in Neuromuscular Monitoring

Senzime's TetraGraph system, which employs electromyography (EMG) technology, has been adopted as the clinical gold standard for neuromuscular monitoring in countries such as the U.S., Japan, and South KoreaSenzime provides market update and outlines high growth ambitions[ 1 ]. This technology enables anesthesiologists to quantitatively assess neuromuscular function during surgeries involving paralytic drugs, reducing complications such as residual paralysis. The Japanese Society of Anesthesiology's 2025 updated guidelines further reinforced the global relevance of EMG-based monitoring, aligning with Senzime's clinical evidence and accelerating its adoptionSenzime welcomes new Japanese guidelines on neuromuscular monitoring[ 4 ].

The U.S. military's selection of TetraGraph for deployment at Walter Reed National Military Medical Center—a key node in the DoD's Military Health System—highlights the system's strategic value. Walter Reed serves active-duty personnel, veterans, and their families, making patient safety a critical prioritySenzime Awarded Contract to Supply the U.S. Department of Defense and Walter Reed National Military Medical Center[ 3 ]. By standardizing neuromuscular monitoring across its operating rooms, the DoD is addressing a long-standing gap in perioperative care, particularly for service members who may face unique surgical risks due to combat-related injuries or chronic conditions.

Contract-Driven Revenue Security: A Shield Against Market Volatility

Senzime's U.S. defense contracts offer a compelling case for revenue stability. While the exact financial terms of the DoD agreement remain undisclosed, the contract includes an expected annual purchase volume of over 5,000 TetraSens sensorsSenzime Awarded Contract to Supply the U.S. Department of Defense and Walter Reed National Military Medical Center[ 3 ]. These sensors, essential for the TetraGraph system's functionality, represent a recurring revenue stream that insulates Senzime from the volatility of one-time equipment sales.

This model mirrors the company's success in civilian healthcare markets, where it has secured contracts with leading Integrated Delivery Networks (IDNs) and university hospital systems. For instance, a major Texas-based hospital system has committed to deploying 63 TetraGraph monitors and collaborating on quality improvement (QI) initiatives to standardize neuromuscular monitoring for 27,000 patients annuallySenzime provides market update and outlines high growth ambitions[ 1 ]. Similarly, a Northeastern IDN has ordered 60 systems, with potential to serve 20,000 patients yearlySenzime Secures Additional US Hospital System Contracts[ 2 ]. These contracts, awarded after rigorous clinical evaluations, reflect the TetraGraph's proven efficacy and its alignment with recent U.S. clinical guidelinesSenzime provides market update and outlines high growth ambitions[ 1 ].

The DoD contract adds a layer of strategic value beyond revenue. Walter Reed's adoption of TetraGraph signals broader acceptance within the U.S. military healthcare system, potentially paving the way for future contracts with other military medical centers. This “defense anchor” effect could accelerate Senzime's market penetration, as the credibility of military healthcare adoption often spills over into civilian institutions.

Strategic Implications for Investors

Senzime's expansion into defense healthcare aligns with its long-term ambition to become the global leader in EMG-based neuromuscular monitoring. With over 4,150 TetraGraph systems shipped globally as of 2025Senzime | Precision-based patient monitoring[ 5 ], the company is well-positioned to capitalize on the phase-out of legacy electromechanical (AMG) systems. The U.S. military's investment in this technology further validates Senzime's clinical and commercial proposition, particularly as healthcare systems worldwide prioritize data-driven patient safety.

For investors, the combination of high-margin sensor sales, recurring QI collaborations, and defense contracts creates a resilient revenue model. While the absence of disclosed contract values for the DoD agreement introduces some uncertainty, the expected sensor volume and Walter Reed's prominence in the Military Health System suggest significant upside. Additionally, Senzime's recent contracts with civilian IDNs—covering over 100,000 patients annually—demonstrate its ability to scale in competitive marketsSenzime Secures Additional US Hospital System Contracts[ 2 ].

Conclusion: A Defensive Play in a High-Growth Sector

Senzime's strategic alignment with U.S. defense healthcare innovation offers a unique blend of revenue security and growth potential. By addressing a critical gap in perioperative care through its EMG-based technology, the company has secured contracts that not only stabilize its financial outlook but also position it at the forefront of a global shift toward evidence-based medical practices.

“Military families likely encounter more administrative barriers to accessing ABA services than civilian families,” the researchers stated in their report.
“The concern is, military families have spent at least 10 years in a demonstration.
The committee included experts in behavior analysis, child development, public health, psychology, health services, biostatistics and autism research.
Along with many other experts, military families receiving ABA and military family advocacy organizations would be included on the advisory council.","Defense Health Agency officials should formally authorize Applied Behavior Analysis, a widely recognized intervention to help children with autism, as a basic Tricare benefit, according to a report on the findings of a congressionally mandated independent study.

The report, conducted by the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering and Medicine, debunks DHA officials’ repeated assertion that ABA services don’t meet their standards for reliable medical evidence.

The researchers lay out their analysis of why ABA meets Tricare’s own standards, defined in law.

Researchers recommend this major shift in Tricare’s policies for military family members diagnosed with autism spectrum disorder, citing problems with an 11-year-old demonstration project that in effect limits the care available for these children.

“It’s time for ABA to be a basic benefit in the Defense Health Agency,” said Dr. Eric Flake, a retired Air Force colonel who is a member of the committee that conducted the study, during a webinar Tuesday.

Each month, about 1,000 military children receive diagnoses of autism, said Flake, who is adjunct faculty at the DOD Developmental-Behavioral Pediatrics Fellowship at Joint Base Lewis McChord, Washington, and an associate professor at the Uniformed Services University of the Health Sciences and the University of Washington.

The researchers, in their 310-page report released Sept. 9, recommend that DHA end its Autism Care Demonstration program, citing some policies that differ from clinical best practices and impose excessive administrative burdens on military families and ABA providers.

The policies limit providers’ ability to target some skills essential to health and well-being, such as self-care tasks known as “activities of daily living.” The policies also restrict providers from providing ABA services in schools and community settings.

While Tricare covers multiple services for beneficiaries diagnosed with autism spectrum disorder, ABA is specifically offered to military-connected families only through the demonstration program, which began in 2014.

Tricare doesn’t authorize ABA services as a “basic benefit,” meaning a covered service that is determined medically necessary as defined by law.

“Military families likely encounter more administrative barriers to accessing ABA services than civilian families,” the researchers stated in their report. “Families expressed appreciation for ABA, but also reported stress and confusion about accessing care due to delays and complex requirements.”

DOD considers National Academies report

The committee also recommended DHA reduce administrative barriers that limit families’ access to ABA services. Families often express concern that the current policies related to ABA are discriminatory.

Autism is the only diagnosis for which family members are required to enroll in the Exceptional Family Member Program and Extended Care Health Option (ECHO) in order to get access to medically recommended care, committee member Jennifer Penhale, an active-duty Air Force spouse and mother to three teenagers with autism, said during the webinar. Penhale chairs the Colorado Developmental Disabilities Council.

The research committee noted that ABA is now standard practice for many autistic individuals across public and private health systems. Since 2019, all states have adopted laws or issued regulatory guidance requiring certain commercial health plans to cover ABA services for people with autism, they reported.

The two-year study found that in spite of defense health officials’ repeated assertions that Applied Behavior Analysis services don’t meet DOD’s standards for reliable medical evidence, ABA does in fact meet DOD’s own standards.

DOD's conclusions flawed about military children's progress with autism therapy, expert says,

Yet in their most recent report to Congress, dated Aug. 19, Defense Health Agency officials stated, “As of now, ABA services do not meet the Tricare hierarchy of reliable evidence standard for proven medical care.”

The Defense Health Agency is reviewing the entire National Academies report, including the recommendations, “to determine our way forward with the Autism Care Demonstration,” officials said in response to questions from Military Times. “Until this review is completed, the Department will continue to provide the services available under the ACD.”

Recommendations remove ‘a lot of barriers’

Dr. Kristi Cabiao, CEO and president of Mission Alpha Advocacy, an organization that advocates for military families within the Exceptional Family Member Program, praised the National Academies committee for its extensive work.

“Here you have this expert committee that says by DOD’s own standards of reliable medical evidence, it’s been met,” Cabiao, the wife of an Air Force retiree and mother of a child with autism, told Military Times.

“The concern is, military families have spent at least 10 years in a demonstration. That’s time that these families will never get back. They had to receive a lower quality ABA services because of really poor policies.”

The National Academies study included a comprehensive review of empirical literature, an analysis of Tricare claims data from 2018 to 2023, an evaluation of policies and procedures and input from military families, researchers and ABA providers.

The committee included experts in behavior analysis, child development, public health, psychology, health services, biostatistics and autism research.

The researchers’ recommendation that DHA formally authorize ABA as a Tricare basic benefit “is the most important recommendation for military families,” said Cabiao. ”It removes a lot of barriers.”

Duty to protect: It's time to remove barriers to autism services for military children

For example, active-duty families would no longer be mandated to enroll in EFMP and ECHO, she said. “We have families who weren’t able to start ABA services right away, having delays of months because of this administrative burden.”

Cementing ABA as a Tricare benefit would also eliminate the worry of a looming 2028 deadline, when the ABA demonstration program is scheduled to end.

“When you’re depending on this really life-saving service, as it was for my child ... to know that in 2028 it might continue or it might not, or may be even more restricted, you don’t have security in what the future holds,” Cabiao said.

Aspects of the military lifestyle, such as frequent moves and caregiver deployments, can disrupt the stability children with autism need in their care.

One military parent told researchers there’s a two-year waitlist just to be evaluated in El Paso, Texas, “which is absurd for those families that have to change duty stations frequently. This means they will never get the chance to be seen,” the parent is quoted as saying in the report.

Autism rates among military children

In DHA’s annual report to Congress dated Aug. 19, officials said that in fiscal 2023, there were 16,747 beneficiaries with diagnoses of autism participating in the demonstration program, at a cost of $435 million. The average paid cost per participant was $25,948.

While it’s difficult to compare the prevalence of autism between the military community and the general population, the National Academies researchers cited one recent review that identified 1 in every 28 military children, or 3.5%, as being diagnosed with autism in the period from 2019 to 2023.

That rate is slightly higher than the rate in the general population of 1 in 31 children with autism diagnoses, or 3.2%, in 2022, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

Cabiao cautions against reading too much into the 0.3% gap between military and civilian populations, stating the difference is minimal and could be partly explained by the consistent system of medical records that keep track of military children’s health care.

Still, she said, “One in 28 is a big number. It clearly demonstrates a readiness and retention issue if we don’t provide quality ABA services.”

During the six-year period from calendar years 2018 to 2023, there were 109,073 children ages 1 to 18 with an autism diagnosis who were eligible for Tricare benefits, according to the committee’s report.

During that time, about one-third of those children had a claim for ABA services. More than half were under age 6, and 89% were under age 12. About four out of five beneficiaries participating in the demonstration are male.

‘New territory’ for the DOD

Other recommendations included in the committee’s report are: aligning Tricare coverage of ABA with clinical best practices; eliminating mandatory assessments that don’t support treatment planning; and establishing an independent advisory council to help guide the transition. Along with many other experts, military families receiving ABA and military family advocacy organizations would be included on the advisory council.

Flake, the retired colonel who sits on the committee, highlighted DHA’s “continued desire to see best practices come forward” in the field of autism treatment over the years.

He noted that many of the recommendations the committee made for DHA to transition from its demonstration program are already put into practice as standard care in other locations.

“We recognize that we may be going into some new territory for DHA, but that also isn’t new for us as a military community,” Flake said. “I have full confidence that with the support of the ABA community, with the support of families and parents, as well as policymakers and guidance from the recommendations of this report, that it can be a relatively smooth transition.”",https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/OuyA02TN2EcTnZuZFPdFOA--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyMDA7aD04ODU7Y2Y9d2VicA--/https://media.zenfs.com/en/military_times_968/f7dd32c49a2edd988a2effcd2dac6452,N,0.0,2025-09-17 15:56:29.764091

Janelle Marra, a Navy physician with more than two decades of service, lost her position this month as director of medical services at Expeditionary Medical Facility 150-Bravo in San Diego. The decision came hours after Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth reposted a screenshot from the conservative account Libs of TikTok that highlighted Marra’s LinkedIn profile, including her use of “she/her” pronouns and a title listed as “Navy Deputy Medical Director for Transgender Health Care.”

Hegseth reposted the screenshot with the caption: “Pronouns UPDATED: She/Her/Fired.” A U.S. defense official confirmed Marra’s removal, citing a loss of confidence in her leadership and possible misuse of social media.

KPBS reports a Navy official says Hegseth ordered the firing; the Military Times does not say who ordered it.

Did the position cited on her profile exist?

Defense officials said the position referenced on Marra’s LinkedIn never formally existed. The Biden administration considered tying the role to a proposed Transgender Health Center within the Defense Health Agency but later abandoned the plan, according to The Military Times.

A Defense Health Agency spokesperson told Military Times, “The Department does not have a Transgender Health Center.”

The official said planners asked services to nominate personnel, and Marra was among those nominees. Why she listed the role on her profile remains unclear.

How have others responded?

Marra has not commented publicly since her removal. Col. Bree Fram, one of the highest-ranking openly transgender officers in the U.S. military and an advocate for transgender service members, called the decision “really disappointing” in remarks to Military Times.

Fram said Marra was targeted over a Navy-assigned role from the past. The Military Times reported the position was never filled.

In an interview with KPBS, Fram described Marra as “an exceptionally qualified doctor who was responsible for taking care of a huge number of sailors and Marines.” Fram also said she has faced threats after being targeted by Libs of TikTok.

What is the broader policy context?

The firing comes as the Trump administration enforces an executive order banning all transgender service members and ending gender-affirming care. A Pentagon memo in February stated that individuals with symptoms or a diagnosis of gender dysphoria have constraints “incompatible with the high mental and physical standards necessary for military service.”

One of Mace’s amendments bans all transition-related health care for transgender service members — even if considered “medically necessary” — as well as for dependents.","LGBTQ advocates are condemning a series of six amendments tacked on to the Fiscal Year 2026 National Defense Authorization Act, a bill that funds the U.S. Department of Defense and other defense-related agencies.

The amendments, which target LGBTQ visibility and transgender health care in particular, were passed on largely party-line votes in the House of Representatives, causing Democrats to cry foul.

U.S. Rep. Mark Takano, chair of the Congressional Equality Caucus, accused Republicans of sacrificing bipartisan support for the NDAA by politicizing the process to curry favor with President Donald Trump and socially conservative voters. He warned that, if enacted, the amendments would harm transgender service members, cadets, and dependents of military personnel.

“Congress should be fighting for those who fight for us — but it’s clear the GOP has other priorities,” he said.

The first amendment, introduced by U.S. Rep. Ralph Norman (R-S.C.) and approved by roll call vote, prohibits children of service members enrolled in the Exceptional Family Member Program from accessing or being referred for gender-affirming treatments. It also bars reassigning service members to a different duty station to ensure their dependents can obtain treatments such as puberty blockers, hormones, or surgeries.

Four vulnerable Democrats from Republican-leaning or swing districts — Reps. Henry Cuellar (Texas), Vicente Gonzalez (Texas), Don Davis (N.C.), and Adam Gray (Calif.) — voted for the rider. Only one Republican, Del. Kimberlyn King-Hinds of the Northern Mariana Islands, voted against it.

Four amendments came from Rep. Nancy Mace (R-S.C.), who has positioned herself as a leading critic of transgender rights in Congress, arguing that she is defending women’s rights and children from policies she claims put them at risk.

One of Mace’s amendments bans all transition-related health care for transgender service members — even if considered “medically necessary” — as well as for dependents. It would bar TRICARE, the military’s main insurance program, from covering puberty blockers, hormone therapy, or surgeries for adults. It would also expand the existing prohibition on TRICARE coverage for dependents under 18 to include mental health services for youth with gender dysphoria.

Six Democrats — Cuellar, Gonzalez, Davis, Gray, Shomari Figures (Ala.), and Cleo Fields (La.) — voted for the ban on transition-related and mental health care. Two Republicans, King-Hinds and Rep. David Joyce (Ohio), opposed it.

Mace’s other amendments include banning transgender athletes at U.S. service academies from competing in female athletic programs; prohibiting the Pentagon from collecting data on service members’ gender identity in any form or survey; and blocking transgender individuals from using single-sex facilities on military bases not designated for their sex, defined by “reproductive system.”

All Republicans backed the transgender sports ban, while King-Hinds opposed both the data collection and facilities bans.

Ten Democrats — including Laura Gillen, John Mannion, and Tom Suozzi of New York; Jared Golden of Maine; Susie Lee of Nevada; and Kim Schrier and Marie Gluesenkamp Perez, both of Washington — supported the sports ban. Four Democrats — Cuellar, Davis, Gonzalez, and Gray — backed the data collection ban, while three voted for the facilities ban.

The final amendment, from Rep. Cory Mills (R-Fla.), bans Pride flags from being flown at Department of Defense facilities. It removes a 2024 NDAA provision that let military leaders approve certain flags — a policy critics said still allowed Pride flags to be displayed.

Five Democrats — Cuellar, Davis, Gillen, Golden, and Perez — supported the flag ban. Two Republicans, Del. Jim Moylan of American Samoa and Rep. Mike Lawler of New York, opposed it.

Luke Schleusener, CEO of Out in National Security, a nonpartisan group advocating for queer national security professionals, condemned the NDAA in its current form.

He called it “rife with cruel, bigoted amendments that undermine that common defense” and “an insult to the responsibilities of Congress and the traditions of the House Armed Services Committee.”

According to Schleusener, the current version of the NDAA “does not make America safer, or the Armed Forces stronger or more capable in a complex and dangerous world. If passed into law, this will harm recruitment, retention, and readiness across the uniformed services and the DOD civilian workforce. It dishonors the past and present service and sacrifice of thousands of Americans — and their children.”",https://www.metroweekly.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Trans-military-Adobe-Firefly.jpg,N,0.0,2025-09-17 12:56:13.858233

To combat this pervasive threat to force readiness, the Defense Health Agency-Public Health ergonomics program within the Occupational Health Sciences directorate at Aberdeen Proving Ground, Maryland, takes a comprehensive approach that recognizes optimal human performance as critical to mission success.

""The program recognizes that ergonomic design is both a force protection and force-multiplication strategy,"" said Steven Chervak, a DHA-PH ergonomist. ""We aim to enhance warfighter performance, health, and safety by integrating ergonomic and human factors principles into military systems, equipment, and operations to reduce injury risk and optimize human-system performance.""

The primary goals of the ergonomics and human factors field are to reduce human error, increase productivity and efficiency, enhance safety, and reduce exposure to work-related musculoskeletal disorder risk factors, said John Pentikis, DHA-PH Ergonomics Branch manager.

Three-pronged approach to injury prevention

The DHA-PH ergonomics team accomplishes its mission through three primary focus areas: design reviews, worksite assessments, and training and education initiatives.

Design reviews, frequently conducted through the health hazard assessment process, aim to incorporate ergonomic principles into the acquisition process to ensure purchased or developed equipment is designed for optimal human performance prior to fielding.

“This proactive approach allows the team to identify and address potential injury risks before equipment reaches service members,” said Chervak.

Worksite assessments use job hazard analysis and biomechanical assessment techniques to optimize performance by improving human-machine interaction. These assessments focus on reducing ergonomic risk factors such as excessive force generation, repetitive motions, and exposure to vibration while optimizing posture for various military tasks, said Chervak.

“We assess a wide variety of work environments, including military hospitals and clinics, clinical care and laboratory settings, laundry and dining services, and industrial environments from cable assembly to paint booths and vehicle maintenance,” said Pentikis. “We also assess musculoskeletal -specific tasks such as weapons loading, litter carrying, parachute rigging, and load carriage.”

The training and education component involves multiple audiences, from teaching occupational health and safety personnel to perform worksite assessments to instructing service members on proper lifting and material handling techniques, said Chervak. The program also provides equipment-specific and site-specific training while educating leadership on ergonomic principles.

“For example, the ergonomics program recently developed specific ergonomic trainings in the areas of dining services, vehicle mechanics, emergency medical technicians, laboratories, and health care environments at the request of customers,” said Chervak.

The ergonomics team continually assesses ergonomics concerns as new equipment is developed.

“There are always new patient care environments, equipment, and circumstances to be assessed for safe patient handling and mobility, and the majority of work environments across the military place workers and military members at some level of musculoskeletal disorder risk,” said Kelsey McCoskey, a DHA-PH ergonomist. “Each time a depot mission changes, and a new system or equipment is being built or refurbished, the ergonomic risk factors change. Helping the local safety and occupational health personnel to continuously identify, prioritize, and remediate these work-related musculoskeletal risks is part of our mission.”

Real-world impact on military operations

Recent ergonomics evaluations have highlighted the direct impact our program can have on service members’ lethality, readiness, and equipment development, said Chervak.

""Studies have established a link between exposure to high levels of whole-body vibration and slowed reaction times,” said Chervak. “In combat scenarios, this delay can be the difference between life and death, especially when rapidly exiting a vehicle and returning fire. However, until now, the levels of whole-body vibration experienced by service members operating in military vehicles during realistic training and operational environments remained largely unknown.”

To address this critical knowledge gap, Chervak and McCoskey collaborated with the National Guard Bureau’s Office of the Joint Surgeon to pilot whole-body vibration exposure data collection on opposing force military vehicles during a recent Operation Northern Strike training exercise. This effort provides crucial data towards characterizing the whole-body vibration exposure soldiers face on missions, said Chervak.

“Additionally, it offers invaluable insights for optimizing future data gathering, allowing us to focus on targeted vehicle types, smaller exercises, and leveraging schoolhouse opportunities to develop a robust soldier vibration exposure algorithm,” said Chervak. “Ultimately, these evaluations aim to inform the development of vehicle designs and operational strategies that minimize vibration exposure, thereby enhancing service member lethality, protecting readiness, and optimizing mission success.

The team has also done whole-body vibration exposure studies with rotary wing aircrews.

""A recent evaluation of whole-body vibration exposure among a select group of rotary wing aircrew by the ergonomics group has led to further investigations by the program managers, structural engineers, and manufacturers of the aircraft to determine methodologies for reducing vibration exposures within the aircraft,"" said Chervak.

The ergonomics team is also at the forefront of emerging technology assessment, particularly in evaluating exoskeletons for military applications, said Kevin Purcell, DHA-PH ergonomist. Currently, the ergonomics program is collaborating with endoscopy surgeons at Walter Reed National Military Medical Center [https://walterreed.tricare.mil/] in Bethesda, Maryland, to determine whether exoskeleton technology can reduce lower back and shoulder muscle fatigue during medical procedures.

""Exoskeletons hold promise for improving ergonomics and reducing the risk of injuries in workplaces with physically demanding tasks,"" said Purcell. ""However, they need to be implemented in the proper settings that carefully consider both the potential benefits and drawbacks, focusing on user-centered design, proper fitting, and thorough assessment in real-world work environments to maximize their effectiveness and minimize potential risks.""

The Walter Reed project uses Surface-Electromyography, or sEMG, to measure muscle activity during simulated endoscopy tasks performed with and without exoskeletons, said Purcell. This process captures muscle activation signals noninvasively through electrodes placed on the skin over target muscles and provides objective data on the technology's effectiveness in reducing muscle activity.

Customer-driven investigations

The ergonomics team determines focus areas through both systematic processes and direct customer requests. Design reviews are coordinated through the HHA process, where the team receives assignments to review specific equipment for ergonomic risk factors including material handling requirements, force requirements, and vibration exposure.

""Work environment, job hazard analysis evaluations, training, and education initiatives are usually customer driven,"" said Chervak. ""We are either contacted by a unit directly or through a safety and occupational health professional who is responsible for the unit.""

Service members and units can request assistance through the ergonomics website by completing DHA Form 435 [right click to download], or by contacting [https://ph.health.mil/Pages/Contact.aspx] the team directly. The team works to route requests through appropriate channels to begin direct collaboration with requesting units.

Targeting work-related musculoskeletal disorders

The ergonomics program specifically targets work-related musculoskeletal disorders which include various types of overuse injuries resulting from repetitive stress or excessive use without adequate recovery time, said Chervak. In military settings, these injuries often blur traditional workplace injury definitions.

""Overuse injuries are a part of work-related musculoskeletal disorders because they result from repetitive stress or excessive use without adequate recovery time,"" said Chervak.

Examples of some disorders commonly linked to ergonomic risk factors are musculoskeletal injury to tendons, ligaments, muscles, and joints; degenerative disc disease; herniated discs; pinched nerves; and carpal tunnel syndrome, said Chervak. Specific examples of military-related overuse injuries [https://dha.mil/News/2025/04/11/14/06/Reducing-impact-of-upper-extremity-injuries-with-early-diagnosis-occupational-therapy] include rotator cuff injuries prevalent among parachute riggers, and back injuries from lifting mortar shells.

Data-driven approach to prevention

To identify emerging trends and prioritize interventions, the ergonomics team collaborates closely with the DHA-PH’s Injury Prevention Branch, which is part of the Clinical Public Health and Epidemiology directorate, also located at Aberdeen Proving Ground, said Chervak. The Injury Prevention Branch tracks injury trends and uses the Force Risk Reduction management and analysis tool [https://joint.safety.army.mil/] which is managed by the U.S. Army Combat Readiness Center [https://safety.army.mil/] at Fort Rucker, Alabama, to recognize patterns and emerging issues across military installations.

FR2 is available to individuals in the SOH community and human resources community with a government-issued CAC and a .mil email address.

Accessing ergonomic support

Multiple pathways of assistance are available for service members experiencing ergonomic concerns. The primary recommendation is to contact local safety officers, industrial hygienists, or occupational health specialists, who serve as the first line of defense for addressing ergonomic issues, said Chervak.

""If your local team cannot resolve the issue internally or needs additional expertise, they will escalate the matter to our specialized team for advanced assessment and solutions,"" said Chervak. “You can also contact us directly if you prefer or if the situation requires immediate attention. We'll work collaboratively with you and your local SOH team.”

The ergonomics program also develops strategic partnerships with installation SOH personnel. In some cases, an ergonomics team member will virtually attend regularly scheduled SOH meetings, said Lauren Costanzi, DHA-PH ergonomist.

One example of the benefits of this type of collaboration is an effort related to the assembly of a fabric military battery pouch. The SOH office had identified the task as being physically difficult to perform and causing hand and wrist injuries, said Costanzi. The pouch is sewn inside out, which requires it to be flipped right side out prior to shipment. This task requires high-hand forces due to the inflexibility of the stiff fabric. DHA-PH ergonomists measured the forces required to manipulate the battery pouch by using a force gauge to push the corners of the pouch into position. The gauge recorded the peak push force as 42 pounds.

“Ergonomists investigated the use of a home-grade steamer to soften the battery pouch fabric,” said Costanzi. “Softening the fabric reduced the push/pull forces required to manipulate the fabric from inside out to right-side out. Subsequent manipulation of the pouch to turn it right side out resulted in maximum pulling force of 10 pounds, which represents a 67% decrease in the amount of force needed to manipulate the battery pouch.”

Strategic partnerships and standards development

Beyond direct service delivery, the DHA-PH ergonomics program maintains strategic partnerships with professional organizations and standards committees to influence policies affecting military operations, said Chervak. The team actively collaborates with the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs Veterans Health Agency Safe Patient Handling and Mobility and ergonomics programs [https://www.publichealth.va.gov/employeehealth/patient-handling/], the Maryland National Guard, and participates in safe patient handling organizations, human vibration exposure technical advisory groups, and exoskeleton standards committees.

“These partnerships ensure the military can shape standards rather than simply comply with them, preventing increased procurement costs while protecting service member health through proactive engagement in policy development,” said Chervak.

The program also provides digital support to U.S. Army and Department of Defense end users through educational materials, fact sheets, policy guidance, professional publications, and regular updates to military ergonomics guidance documents.

Now, doctors and medical leaders across the Military Health System have a newly released, comprehensive, standardized, evidence-based playbook to help them recognize and manage ER in service members.
Although the guideline was created with warfighters in mind, it also has broad applications in the civilian world.
The new Clinical Practice Guideline gives medical teams: Clear diagnostic standards to help doctors recognize ER earlier and more accurately.
“At the Army Heat Center, we frequently see cases of exertional rhabdomyolysis, either secondary to heat illness or on its own.","SEPTEMBER 17, 2025 – When muscles work too hard, they can actually begin to break down — a dangerous condition known as exertional rhabdomyolysis, or ER. Left untreated, ER can quickly lead to kidney damage, chemical imbalances in the body or even life-threatening complications.

Now, doctors and medical leaders across the Military Health System have a newly released, comprehensive, standardized, evidence-based playbook to help them recognize and manage ER in service members. The Clinical Practice Guideline for the Management of Exertional Rhabdomyolysis was developed by the Uniformed Services University, in collaboration with the Army Heat Center and other Department of War partners through the Warrior Heat- and Exertion-Related Events Collaborative based at USU’s Consortium for Health and Military Performance.

“We are very pleased to release this 2025 Rhabdomyolysis CPG update, which presents multiple significant changes and additions from our 2020 product,” said Dr. Francis O’Connor, professor of military and emergency medicine and CHAMP medical director. “Our joint service team of DOW providers, representing hundreds of years of military relevant experience, has worked very hard to share the most current evidence-based information to our military colleagues to optimize the diagnosis and initial management of warfighters impacted by exertional rhabdomyolysis, and importantly, facilitate return to duty decisions.”

ER occurs when strenuous activity, such as intense training, heavy labor or combat conditions, causes muscle fibers to break down and release their contents into the bloodstream. Early warning signs may include extreme muscle pain, weakness or very dark urine. In severe cases, ER can lead to acute kidney injury, requiring hospitalization or even dialysis.

Although the guideline was created with warfighters in mind, it also has broad applications in the civilian world. Athletes, firefighters, first responders and anyone engaged in high-intensity physical activity may face similar risks, making the resource valuable beyond the military.

The new Clinical Practice Guideline gives medical teams:

Clear diagnostic standards to help doctors recognize ER earlier and more accurately.

Risk categories that sort patients into low or high risk based on lab results and clinical signs.

Tools like the McMahon Score, which combines test results and patient information to predict the chance of kidney injury.

Step-by-step flow charts and decision aids that simplify what can be a complex clinical situation.

Patients at high risk — those with extremely elevated muscle enzymes, signs of compartment syndrome, kidney damage or complicating factors like sickle cell trait — require close monitoring in the hospital. Others, especially those at lower risk, may be safely managed outside the hospital through rest, hydration and follow-up care within 24 to 72 hours.

One of the most important parts of the guideline is its framework for return-to-duty decisions. Low-risk patients progress gradually from rest to reconditioning, while higher-risk patients follow a tailored plan developed with input from specialists.

“At the Army Heat Center, we frequently see cases of exertional rhabdomyolysis, either secondary to heat illness or on its own. Unlike exertional heatstroke, prior to the development of this CPG, return-to-duty guidance was lacking,” said Army Lt. Col. [Dr.] David DeGroot, Army Heat Center director. “Now, providers have a resource to help as they work to return the injured warfighter to duty as quickly as possible, but without jeopardizing their health or increasing risk of reoccurrence.”

The guideline is designed for use by primary care, emergency medicine, sports medicine and operational clinicians across the military. Command medical leaders can also use it to help shape policies around training, selection and deployment cycles. Civilian physicians, athletic trainers and occupational health providers may also find it a valuable reference.
