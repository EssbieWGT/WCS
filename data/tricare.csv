To be considered to earn the Gold Seal of Approval, hospitals and clinics need to demonstrate compliance with high standards of performance through rigorous, unannounced, onsite observations, where a team of Joint Commission reviewers evaluate compliance in many areas of health care. The Joint Commission’s standards are developed in consultation with health care experts and providers, measurement experts, and patients. They are informed by scientific literature and expert consensus to help health care organizations measure, assess, and improve performance.
Throughout the years, military hospitals and clinics in the Military Health System have received the Gold Seal of Approval for excellence in providing health care.
