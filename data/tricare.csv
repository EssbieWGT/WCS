Military life: 40% logistics, 60% existential dread.","At this point, waiting on orders has come down to lying to friends and hoping for divine intervention.

The purgatory between “should hear soon” and “nothing yet” is where military life earns its reputation. Hurry up and wait isn’t just a cute saying on a mug at the PX. It’s literally reality for so many of us.

You probably already know the calendar is a prop. Plans are theoretical. Every decision rests on the most fragile word in the English language: maybe.

Waiting on orders can feel like you’re hanging out in limbo with bad Wi-Fi, mismatched chairs, and a clipboard that never seems to have your name on it.

The hope phase

It always starts with a rumor. A passing comment. A cryptic text that says, “Should know by Friday.” No official paperwork, no confirmation. But you open Zillow anyway because you’re a glutton for hope. You know it’s a mistake, but you just can’t help yourself.

Inevitably, by Tuesday, the vision board is in full swing. Commute times calculated. Crime maps reviewed. Every coffee shop, bookstore, and gym within a 20-mile radius is evaluated like it’s a tactical asset.

Pinterest boards multiply. Potential school districts are ranked by test scores and proximity to a Chick-fil-A. The local spouse Facebook group is joined, lurked, and mentally judged.

All the while, you try to remind yourself that orders haven’t been cut. The RFO hasn’t even gone out. You rationalize this by saying you’re doing work that future you will thank you for. (Famous last words if ever they were spoken.)

Time for a refresh spiral

Orders could drop any minute. Any. Minute. Now.

Phone checks spike to medical-emergency levels. Email gets refreshed until the app freezes. Gmail starts asking if you’re human.

Zillow becomes a recreational contact sport as you wait for orders. Houses with wraparound porches, granite countertops, and yards you’ll never mow. Listings get bookmarked, screenshotted, and filed into two categories: Dream Homes and Fine, I Could Make It Work.

The spiral deepens when the “Dream Home” goes pending before the orders even exist. It feels personal.

Enter your lie-to-friends era

You know you’re in for it when the group chat stops asking for updates. The answer has been nothing yet for so long it’s become the military spouse version of “I’m fine.”

Instead, the lies start. “We should know soon.” “Probably late spring.” “After training wraps.”

It’s not malice. It’s survival. There are only so many times you can say “nothing yet” before you start to believe it means “never.” And really, how long does it actually take HRC to decide what the next three years of your life will look like?

Passive-aggressive packing

Still no location, but you know what? Let’s just pack these three boxes anyway. Of course, you won’t go for the essentials. Instead, you pack in the waffle iron, the Christmas mugs, the decorative pillows no one uses. A roll of tape gets yanked and slapped down on the cardboard like a mic drop because you have to do something.

Inevitably, those boxes sit in the hallway for six weeks as silent monuments to the absurdity of military timelines. They collect dust and passive-aggressive glares from anyone who trips over them (which is you, every morning).

The social media mirage

On Instagram, life is calm. The pictures are seasonal. The captions are neutral.

Offline, the fridge calendar is a fever dream of possible dates and tentative moves. Every conversation is an exercise in verbal gymnastics: saying enough to sound informed, but not enough to be wrong when the inevitable pivot happens. And really, are you even asking for much besides clarity? No. No, you are not.

Time to start bargaining

Somewhere between week three and week twelve of limbo, bargaining kicks in. Deals get cut with the universe like you’re negotiating a hostage release. If the orders drop by Friday, I’ll stop trash-talking battalion runs. If they come in before the weekend, I’ll finally organize the garage.

You start convincing yourself that the delay is a blessing. More time to save. Or to purge the linen closet. Even more time to “mentally prepare.”

It’s all a lie, of course. The only thing the extra time does is give you more days to check your email like a slot machine and spiral over Zillow listings you’ll never move into.

Finally, the RFO!

It never comes when you’re ready. It drops on a random Tuesday afternoon, right after you’ve made peace with the idea of dying at your current duty station.

And of course, it’s not to the city you’ve been Zillow-stalking for six months. That would make things far too simple. Instead, you’re suddenly panic-googling a place you’ve only ever heard mentioned on the way to somewhere else. There you are, once again frantically checking neighborhoods, schools, and whether the nearest Target is going to require driving.

The group text lights up: Finally! Then: Where to? You say the name, and everyone tilts their head like they’re trying to place it. The congratulations are sincere. The geography knowledge is not.

Cue immediate amnesia

Two weeks post-move, the agony of waiting is gone. It’s replaced by new problems: lost shipments, bad neighbors, and a base gym that smells like 2009.

But the cycle always restarts. A new rumor. Or a new Zillow tab. Maybe even a new stack of boxes taped shut in an act of quiet defiance.

We are proud and privileged to support TRICARE East beneficiaries and providers.”","CHESAPEAKE, Va. (WAVY) — Growing pains and inadequate testing are just some of the possible roots of the problems that Humana Military is having processing claims for TRICARE, the health insurance provider for military members and their families, according to Rep. Jen Kiggans (R-2nd Dist.).

Humana started a new contract with TRICARE in January. Kiggans said that has been long enough for the company to get up to speed, and said Humana could have done more testing before they went live seven months ago.

“So now they’re having to start over, and especially in registering for early electronic payment or credentialing and recertification,” Kiggans said following Monday’s roundtable discussion. “So there’s a lot of starting over that’s creating some slowdowns in the reimbursement process.”

John and Joanne Demonte own Demonte Medical Billing Solutions, with dozens of provider clients who rely on timely reimbursement from TRICARE. They said ever since Humana took over, reimbursement has been unpredictable and riddled with mistakes.

“They’re denying for out-of-network, when the providers are in-network,” John Demonte said after he and his wife attended Kiggans’ roundtable. “Their data is just incorrect in the system, whereas our data and everything that’s being sent out on the provider’s end is correct.”

Kiggans is both a veteran and a health care professional herself.

“It really is in my wheelhouse to try to fix some of these procedural things that we can do to dictate to TRICARE how to take care of our military families,” she said.

Humana had representatives at the table Monday at the Regional Board Room in Greenbrier, along with Sentara, Riverside, Chesapeake Regional and several smaller provider groups. Kiggans said those providers and the military families they serve have waited long enough for Humana to make things right.

“We need to expedite those things. It’s now almost September. It’s been many months now.”

When we asked Humana for comment, a spokesperson sent this statement:

“We appreciated the opportunity to participate in today’s roundtable hosted by Congresswoman Kiggans and to hear from the provider community. Our priority is always TRICARE East Region beneficiaries and their ability to get access to care. We have worked closely with impacted providers, and will continue to do so, to ensure they continue to care for TRICARE East Region beneficiaries. This includes taking actions to quickly contact providers in the East Region who have expressed concerns about delayed claims payments to better understand their situations and support them. We are proud and privileged to support TRICARE East beneficiaries and providers.”",https://www.wavy.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2025/08/snapshot-2025-08-25T174324.166.jpg?w=1280,N,0.0,2025-08-25 18:56:15.781182

The counties affected are Deschutes and Jefferson.

To receive an emergency refill of prescription medications, TRICARE beneficiaries should take their prescription bottle to any TRICARE retail network pharmacy. If the bottle is unavailable or the label is damaged or missing, beneficiaries should contact Express Scripts, Inc., or their retail network pharmacy for assistance.

To find a network pharmacy, beneficiaries may call Express Scripts at 1-877-363-1303, or search the network pharmacy locator: https://militaryrx.express-scripts.com/find-pharmacy.

If possible, visit the pharmacy where the prescription was filled. Prescriptions filled by a retail chain may be filled at another store in that chain. If the clinician who prescribed the medication is available, beneficiaries can ask them to call in a new prescription to any network pharmacy.

As a reminder, TRICARE beneficiaries, other than active duty service members, may receive urgent care from any TRICARE-authorized urgent care center or provider and do not need a referral. This allows beneficiaries to seek nonemergency care for illnesses or injuries if their primary care provider is unavailable because of emergencies. Any TRICARE beneficiary who reasonably believes they have an emergency should always call 911 or, go to the nearest emergency room.

Beneficiaries are advised to visit Express Scripts’ Weather Notices page for updates: https://militaryrx.express-scripts.com/notices/weather.

The Defense Health Agency provides health services to 9.5 million beneficiaries, including uniformed service members, military retirees, and their families.

FORT HOOD, Texas – August is National Immunization Awareness Month, and it’s a prime time to ensure your family is fully protected.

Whether it’s keeping up with kids’ and teens’ shots, getting your booster as an adult, or making sure you’re ready for flu season and COVID-19 updates, vaccines are a simple and powerful way to keep yourself and your loved ones healthy.

“Vaccines are one of the simplest ways we can protect ourselves and our loved ones from preventable illness,” said Kelly Pitts, pediatrics registered nurse at Carl R. Darnall Army Medical Center. “Making sure children are current on their shots helps prevent outbreaks and keeps classrooms safe.”

Why Immunizations Matter

Children & Adolescents: Vaccines protect against serious diseases such as measles, mumps, rubella, whooping cough, and polio. Additional immunizations like HPV and meningococcal are vital as children grow and get exposed to new environments.

Adults: Boosters for tetanus, shingles, pneumonia, and COVID-19 are key to reducing risk, especially as new variants circulate.

Community Impact: Keeping immunizations current isn’t just about individual health—it’s about building a healthier, stronger community.

It’s important to know that it can take several weeks after vaccination for the body to build full immunity. If you’re planning to visit a newborn — who cannot receive all their vaccines right away — be sure to get your immunizations well in advance of the visit, added Pitts.

“As the seasons change, so do the risks of illness,” said Lacy Kirkes, chief nurse of family and community medicine at CRDAMC. “We encourage adults not to overlook their own vaccines, especially flu shots, which are an important safeguard against serious complications.”

Please note: Keeping your family’s details updated in DEERS is essential for smooth scheduling and services. Visit the hospital immunization site for more information at https://darnall.tricare.mil/Health-Services/Preventive-Care/Immunizations or the clinics page at https://darnall.tricare.mil/Clinics.

How to Schedule Appointments

For children and adolescents: Schedule an appointment with the Pediatric Immunization Clinic to ensure shots are completed.

For travel-related vaccines or allergy services: Contact the Allergy & Immunization Clinic to book an appointment.

For adult vaccinations: Visit Thomas Moore Clinic during routine hours or walk in for COVID-19 vaccines at the Family Medicine Residency Clinic. See the table below for clinic locations and phone numbers with walk in immunization services.

Active-duty military personnel: Use the Soldier Medical Readiness Center as coordinated through your chain of command.

“Getting vaccinated isn’t just about protecting yourself,” added Kirkes. “It’s about protecting your family, your unit, and the community as a whole.” This Immunization Awareness Month, take advantage of the convenient clinics and diverse services offered at CRDAMC to keep your family—and your community—resilient and ready for the months ahead.

Have you recently used tricare.mil to search for TRICARE benefit information? Do you have suggestions about how to improve content on the website? Are you interested in shaping the future of TRICARE’s web presence?

The Defense Health Agency Usability Lab is looking for participants for a tricare.mil usability study. The DHA Usability Lab will hold several studies to get feedback on the website.

During these sessions, usability study leaders will ask participants to test out specific scenarios. Participants will have the chance to share their thoughts and feedback on the website’s:

• Content

• Navigation

• Visuals

• Layout

All studies meet remotely between Aug. 25 and Sept. 5. Each session lasts for about one hour.

The DHA Usability Lab is looking for participants from across different health plans, ages, locations, and life experiences. To participate, you must:

• Be a current TRICARE beneficiary

• Be at least 18 years old

• Have a computer or mobile device to access tricare.mil and Microsoft Teams (no Microsoft Teams account required)

• Have a stable internet connection and the ability to share your screen

• Have a working microphone

• Be available on weekdays between 11 a.m. and 6 p.m. ET

You don’t need to have a current Common Access Card or Uniformed Services ID card to participate. You’ll only need to use the live version of tricare.mil.

What to expect

DHA won’t publicly share the names or information of study participants. But you’ll be asked to share your thoughts aloud with other participants on the call. The call may be recorded.

Once the study is over, the DHA Usability Lab and TRICARE communications team will analyze the results. They’ll then use this data to help shape efforts to update and redesign different parts of tricare.mil. This will enable the website to better serve military families as they navigate getting care and using their TRICARE benefit.

How to register

Note: As of Aug. 25, the usability study has reached capacity and is no longer accepting new registrants.

All counties are affected.

To receive an emergency refill of prescription medications, TRICARE beneficiaries should take their prescription bottle to any TRICARE retail network pharmacy. If the bottle is unavailable or the label is damaged or missing, beneficiaries should contact Express Scripts, Inc., or their retail network pharmacy for assistance.

To find a network pharmacy, beneficiaries may call Express Scripts at 1-877-363-1303, or search the network pharmacy locator: https://militaryrx.express-scripts.com/find-pharmacy

If possible, visit the pharmacy where the prescription was filled. Prescriptions filled by a retail chain may be filled at another store in that chain. If the clinician who prescribed the medication is available, beneficiaries can ask them to call in a new prescription to any network pharmacy.

As a reminder, TRICARE beneficiaries, other than active duty service members, may receive urgent care from any TRICARE-authorized urgent care center or provider and do not need a referral. This allows beneficiaries to seek nonemergency care for illnesses or injuries if their primary care provider is unavailable because of emergencies. Any TRICARE beneficiary who reasonably believes they have an emergency should always call 911 or, go to the nearest emergency room.

Beneficiaries are advised to visit Express Scripts’ Weather Notices page for updates: https://militaryrx.express-scripts.com/notices/weather

The Defense Health Agency Usability Lab is looking for participants for a tricare.mil usability study. The DHA Usability Lab will hold several studies to get feedback on the website.

During these sessions, usability study leaders will ask participants to test out specific scenarios. Participants will have the chance to share their thoughts and feedback on the website’s:

VA Healthcare is VA. You may want to look into Community Care through the VA.
The problem isn’t contained to the VA. VA access wise is somewhat faster than the civilian side if you compare point of referral to intervention (surgery).

A good option if the VA care sucks where you live, you have a family to cover and you can’t afford private health insurance.","You were told incorrectly. The only time a veteran can elect either Tricare or VA health care is if they retired from the military, either medical retirement, regular retirement, or reserve/national guard retirement with age requirements met.

The veterans who are 100% P&T but do not meet those standards cannot elect Tricare.

Tricare is DOD. VA Healthcare is VA.

You may want to look into Community Care through the VA.

The problem isn’t contained to the VA.

VA access wise is somewhat faster than the civilian side if you compare point of referral to intervention (surgery).

Basically the VA answers to congress and the executive branch, but hospital systems answer to shareholders and patients/insurance companies.

It’s largely why if you have an amazing PPO that pays well a lot of groups will find a slot for you to keep you in the system, whereas if you have Medicare solo or Tricare since it’s pretty much shit reimbursement depending on how shady the system is you might go in the regular line. Obviously if you have something urgent no one is doing anything unethical.

Example, I needed to see ENT for sinus problems. My local area healthcare system has a chronic problem of having enough surgeons, not enough OR time slots and way too many patients. It’s basically each surgeon getting a half day OR slot one day a week right now at multiple hospitals and surgery centers.

The VA has a problem with not enough surgeons, but a ton of OR time slots. So you get bogged down on the referral wait, but it eases up after the visit.

I still went to the regular health system though since my rule is anything close to the brain goes to the university and the VA didn’t offer stealth.

Also, most ROBUST VAs are staffed by your local academic hospital so you’re largely getting the same specialty care so it’s really just same doctors different scrubs. So a lot of the time it just makes no sense for me to pay a copay at the university and wait in the same line when I can just go to the VA, not pay a copay but wait in the same line.

I find that VA primary care does a better job than normal people family medicine. VA primary care has longer time slots, pharmacy takes more of an active role to prevent interactions instead of relying on your doctor to interface with Costco and hoping that they notice that one medication you got from Walgreens that interacts with one of your Costco medications.

Obviously a lot of this doesn’t apply to you with Tricare, but it paints the picture pretty well enough.

My VA system isn’t very good in Northern NJ. Thankfully, I have amazing private insurance through my employer and I can be seen the same day by a specialist if need be. My primary care physician is amazing and she has helped me way more than the VA has over the years.

The only thing I go to the VA for is to replace my hearing aids. I’m retired and honestly, my family gets great care and while not cheap, it’s totally worth it.

Edit: As for Tricare… I had it after returning from deployment and while it was cheap, the process of getting care from specialists was tedious. A good option if the VA care sucks where you live, you have a family to cover and you can’t afford private health insurance.",,N,0.0,2025-08-25 12:56:08.996766

It's crucial to understand the nuances: Emergency Care: If you experience a medical emergency while overseas, TRICARE will typically cover the necessary care.
Non-Emergency Care: TRICARE typically does not cover non-emergency medical care received internationally.
Even with TRICARE, purchasing supplemental travel insurance is highly recommended, especially for international travel.
Travel insurance can help cover expenses not included under TRICARE, such as: Non-emergency medical care: Routine check-ups or treatments for pre-existing conditions.","TRICARE, the health insurance program for military members, retirees, and their families, offers comprehensive coverage within the United States. However, its coverage for international travel is a complex issue, varying significantly depending on several factors. This guide will delve into the specifics, answering common questions and clarifying the intricacies of TRICARE's international health benefits.

What Does TRICARE Cover Overseas?

TRICARE's coverage for international travel is not a simple ""yes"" or ""no."" It depends heavily on the circumstances of the travel and the specific TRICARE plan you're enrolled in. Generally, TRICARE can cover emergency care received while traveling internationally, but this isn't automatic. It's crucial to understand the nuances:

Emergency Care: If you experience a medical emergency while overseas, TRICARE will typically cover the necessary care. However, you'll likely need to pay upfront and then file for reimbursement. The process and amount of reimbursement can vary.

Non-Emergency Care: TRICARE typically does not cover non-emergency medical care received internationally. Routine check-ups, elective procedures, and pre-existing condition treatment generally aren't covered under standard TRICARE plans when outside the U.S.

Authorized Travel: For individuals on authorized military assignments or deployments overseas, TRICARE coverage is usually more extensive and aligned with the specifics of the assignment. Coverage details should be addressed in orders or through the military chain of command.

Plan Variations: The different TRICARE plans (Prime, Select, Reserve Select, etc.) have varying levels of coverage and cost-sharing responsibilities for international care, even in emergencies. Understanding your specific plan's benefits is critical.

What if I Need Urgent Care While Traveling Abroad?

If you require urgent or emergency medical care while traveling internationally, here's what you should do:

Seek immediate medical attention: Your health is the priority. Go to the nearest appropriate medical facility.

Document everything: Keep copies of all medical bills, receipts, and documentation regarding the care received. This is vital for reimbursement claims.

Contact TRICARE: Once you're stable, contact TRICARE to initiate the claims process. Be prepared to provide detailed information about the incident and the medical care.

Understand your plan: Before traveling, review your TRICARE plan's international coverage details carefully. Understanding your responsibilities and limitations is crucial.

Does TRICARE Cover Evacuation from a Foreign Country?

TRICARE's coverage for medical evacuation from a foreign country is also dependent on the circumstances. In many instances, medical evacuation is covered under certain circumstances, particularly for emergency situations where the care isn't available locally. However, this is usually subject to certain pre-approvals and requirements. Again, contacting TRICARE directly before international travel is advisable to clarify the conditions under which medical evacuation is covered.

What About Travel Insurance for TRICARE Beneficiaries?

Even with TRICARE, purchasing supplemental travel insurance is highly recommended, especially for international travel. Travel insurance can help cover expenses not included under TRICARE, such as:

Non-emergency medical care: Routine check-ups or treatments for pre-existing conditions.

Trip cancellations or interruptions: Unexpected events that force you to cut your trip short.

Lost or stolen baggage: Protection against financial losses due to lost belongings.

Comprehensive travel insurance can offer peace of mind and protect you from significant out-of-pocket costs, supplementing the coverage you receive from TRICARE.

How Can I Learn More About TRICARE International Coverage?

The best source of information is the official TRICARE website. They provide detailed information on specific plan benefits, claims procedures, and international coverage guidelines. You can also contact TRICARE customer service directly to ask specific questions about your circumstances and plan.

Remember, proactive preparation is crucial. Understanding TRICARE's international coverage before you embark on your journey will save you time, stress, and potentially significant financial burden. Don't rely on assumptions—check the official information sources and plan accordingly.",https://www.mos.vwv.co.uk/image/does-tricare-cover-international-travel.jpeg,N,0.0,2025-08-25 12:56:26.446899

Health care coverage is critical to increasing long-term readiness and strengthening efforts to recruit and retain service members.
“The National Guard is continually on the front lines both at home and abroad.
“Our Guard members need this, and our nation needs them.
The bill would provide all service members with access to health services provided by network providers with no cost-sharing burden.","Legislation introduced last week by Sen. Tammy Baldwin, D-Wis., would ensure premium-free medical insurance coverage is provided for all members of the National Guard and Reserve.

If passed, the Healthcare for our Troops Act would give Guard and Reserve members access to no-fee health care through TRICARE Reserve Select.

Currently, TRS charges a fee for medical and dental coverage.

Health care coverage is critical to increasing long-term readiness and strengthening efforts to recruit and retain service members.

“The National Guard is continually on the front lines both at home and abroad. Comprehensive healthcare is not a benefit; it’s a necessity for readiness,” said retired Maj. Gen. Francis M. McGinn, the NGAUS president.

“Our Guard members need this, and our nation needs them. I thank Senator Baldwin and her staff for their dedication to the National Guard and for their work on this effort.”

In remarks made at the 147th NGAUS General Conference & Exhibition in Milwaukee, Aug. 23, Baldwin noted that about 130,000 Guardsmen and Reservists lack private health insurance.

“I believe it is morally wrong. It is bad for preparedness and readiness. And, yes, we need to change it,” Baldwin told the audience.

Baldwin was the 2025 recipient of the Harry S. Truman Award, the association’s most prestigious honor. [Video of Baldwin’s remarks can be found here. They begin at 13:25.]

Besides expanding TRS, the bill would strengthen military readiness by ensuring access to needed physicals for no-notice deployments.

The bill also would incentivize employers to hire Guard and Reservists.

The bill would provide all service members with access to health services provided by network providers with no cost-sharing burden.

It would also facilitate more affordable access to critical preventive medical services as well as mental health care.",https://www.ngaus.org/sites/default/files/styles/max_1300x1300/public/2025-08/baldwin082425final1000.jpg?itok=BenVB1py,N,0.0,2025-08-24 18:56:07.759967

Question

Avi Dahan, on for Shagun Singh, asked about the specifics of the 2022 TRICARE audit, the lack of advance warning on the payment suspension, and the rationale for not providing full-year 2025 guidance given that 75% of revenue is unaffected. He also questioned the company's plan for its upcoming April meeting with the Defense Health Agency.

Answer

Executive Anna Lucsok described the 2022 audit as a routine post-payment review with standard adjustments and no major issues identified. Executive Thomas Sandgaard explained that full-year guidance was withheld because the potential revenue impact from TRICARE is substantial, possibly exceeding $50 million, creating too much uncertainty. He emphasized the issue is isolated and not indicative of a domino effect with other payers. For the April meeting, Anna Lucsok stated they will present data on policy compliance and reference the adjustments made following the 2022 audit, although TRICARE's specific concerns remain vague.

Regarding the strategic review, Sandgaard confirmed the company has received letters of intent and is actively engaged with one party, though a resolution is not expected in the immediate future.

The Defense Health Agency Usability Lab is looking for Tricare beneficiaries to participate in research via remote meetings between Aug. 25 and Sept. 5. The lab will hold several studies, asking participants to test out specific scenarios. Each session will last about one hour.

Officials want feedback on the content, navigation, visuals and layout of the website.

It comes at an opportune time, as Tricare’s open season begins Nov. 10, when people will be exploring their options for Tricare coverage. However, it’s not clear whether any recommendations for changes in the website would be implemented before open season.

Researchers are looking for participants from a variety of Tricare health plans, ages, locations and experiences.

Those eligible must be current Tricare beneficiaries who are at least 18 years old and have a computer or mobile device in order to access Tricare.mil and Microsoft Teams. A Microsoft Teams account is not required. Participants must have a stable internet connection, the ability to share their screen and a working microphone. They must be available on weekdays between 11 a.m. and 6 p.m. Eastern Time.

Participants don’t need a current Common Access Card or Uniformed Services ID card to participate.

Researchers and the Tricare communications team will use the data to help update and redesign different parts of the Tricare.mil site. The Defense Health Agency won’t publicly share names or information of study participants, but participants will be asked to share their input with other participants on the call.

Those who want to participate should send an email by Wednesday, Sept. 3, to dha.jblm.solution-deliv.list.dha-usability-lab@health.mil.

Include “Tricare Usability Study” in the email subject line, and in the email, provide your name, age, location, Tricare health plan, how long you’ve been a Tricare beneficiary and your beneficiary category, such as active duty service member, retiree, or active duty family member, for example.

Participants will be chosen on a first-come, first-served basis. Researchers may not be able to include everyone due to capacity constraints.

If you’re not able to join the study, beneficiaries may submit feedback via the Tricare.mil questionnaire. You can provide feedback there about how you are using the website, whether you found what you were looking for and how to improve its content.",https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/Ns2sZvg6I1LBMC3T0gh6TA--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyMDA7aD04MDA7Y2Y9d2VicA--/https://media.zenfs.com/en/military_times_968/e4a40e2c88415256442a4bf2f504d077,N,0.0,2025-08-23 15:56:08.032857
