The sharp decline is attributed to President Donald Trump’s reversal of Biden-era policies that expanded access to abortions, according to Defense Health Agency records released this month.
“We know that the Biden administration used every lever at its disposal to push unlimited abortion and this included policy changes in the military.
The pro-life organization emphasized the clarity of longstanding federal restrictions, noting, “The law is very clear: taxpayer dollars and military facilities cannot be used for elective abortions.

The sharp decline is attributed to President Donald Trump’s reversal of Biden-era policies that expanded access to abortions, according to Defense Health Agency records released this month.

The data, disclosed November 20 in response to a Freedom of Information Act request, shows TRICARE recorded just two abortions through June 11, 2025 — compared with 35 for all of 2021 under Biden.

The figures reflect abortions “performed or funded consistent with Title 10, United States Code, Section 1093,” the agency said, a federal law that strictly limits taxpayer-funded abortions to very rare instances of rape, incest or when the mother’s life is endangered.

The downturn follows Trump’s January executive orders to “end the use of Federal taxpayer dollars to fund or promote elective abortion” and dismantle what the Trump admin called the prior administration’s “whole-of-government effort to promote and fund abortion.”

Pro-life advocates hailed the numbers as evidence of renewed commitment to protecting unborn life in the armed forces.

“We know that the Biden administration used every lever at its disposal to push unlimited abortion and this included policy changes in the military. Under the Trump administration, policies pushing abortion have been nullified or reversed,” the National Right to Life Committee said in a statement.

The pro-life organization emphasized the clarity of longstanding federal restrictions, noting, “The law is very clear: taxpayer dollars and military facilities cannot be used for elective abortions. When that standard is followed and enforced, it naturally limits the number of abortions performed.”

National Right to Life also credited the military’s inherent values with bolstering family support amid the policy shift.

“We know the military community has a strong culture of service, mutual responsibility, and support for families,” the group said, adding that priorities like expanded conscience protections for medical personnel and enhanced reporting requirements continue to safeguard life-affirming choices.

Well-defined literature was used to identify the selected procedures as frequent markers of low-value surgical care.
Among these, 54,553 (56%) occurred between 2016 and 2019 compared with 43,597 between 2020 and 2023, demonstrating a steady decline in low-value surgical intervention over time.
Furthermore, outpatient procedures performed in the private sector consistently demonstrated higher odds of low-value care compared with direct care in both time periods.
The study had several limitations, including an inability to identify the causal factors driving differences in low-value surgical care across environments.","Health care systems and patients may benefit from shifting from fee-for-service (FFS) reimbursement models to salaried payment structures, according to a new study published in JAMA Network Open.¹

The findings align with prior research demonstrating that low-value care is less common in larger, integrated health systems. Low-value care often results from varying physician and patient beliefs, lack of ideal clinical approaches, or strong patient preferences. These factors may lead physicians to recommend surgical interventions that offer limited benefit based on a patient’s current clinical state. Unnecessary procedures increase costs and pose risks of complications or adverse events—issues that tend to be more pronounced in FFS environments.¹

Although many physicians paid under FFS models—such as those reimbursed by CMS—participate in value-based care initiatives, incentives can vary. Programs such as the Hospital Readmissions Reduction Program penalize excessive 30-day readmissions for conditions like heart failure or pneumonia, encouraging hospitals and clinicians to critically evaluate treatment pathways.²˒³ However, these programs overlay, rather than replace, the core FFS structure.

The study analyzed TRICARE health care claims within the US Military Health System (MHS) from 2016 to 2023. A total of 304,908 surgical procedures were initially identified; the most common was partial meniscectomy (42%), followed by acromioplasty (29%).¹ Additional procedures included rotator cuff repair and wrist or ankle arthroscopy. Well-defined literature was used to identify the selected procedures as frequent markers of low-value surgical care.

Patients 10 years and older who underwent outpatient surgery were included. Those with diagnoses of infection, tumor, or trauma at the time of surgery were excluded. The mean patient age was 47.2 years, and 189,648 (62%) were male patients. Of them, 12% identified as Black, 57% as White, and 8% as other race.

Overall, 98,150 procedures (32%) met criteria for low-value care. Among these, 54,553 (56%) occurred between 2016 and 2019 compared with 43,597 between 2020 and 2023, demonstrating a steady decline in low-value surgical intervention over time.

The final analytic cohort included 233,133 procedures with complete data for regression analyses. Procedures performed in private-sector care (FFS) had significantly higher odds of meeting low-value criteria (OR, 1.41; 95% CI, 1.38-1.45; P < .001).¹

The odds of low-value care were higher between 2016 and 2019 than between 2020 and 2023 across both care sectors (direct care: OR, 0.78; 95% CI, 0.73-0.83; P < .001; private sector: OR, 0.93; 95% CI, 0.91-0.96; P < .001). Furthermore, outpatient procedures performed in the private sector consistently demonstrated higher odds of low-value care compared with direct care in both time periods.

The study had several limitations, including an inability to identify the causal factors driving differences in low-value surgical care across environments. Also, the second analysis excluded active-duty service members, which limits generalizability. Additionally, researchers could not evaluate nonpayment-related factors—such as surgical practice culture, access to specialists, or evolving clinical guidelines—that may also influence low-value care rates.

“Changing the reimbursement model from FFS to salaried may be associated with as much as a 41% change in the odds of low-value surgical intervention,” the authors concluded.¹",https://cdn.sanity.io/images/0vv8moc6/ajmc/7eae1e4402fbd993cbaac0464bf6ef9efde92868-3565x2673.jpg,N,0.0,2025-12-02 18:56:54.931248

The federal government alleged that CVS improperly requested and received reimbursement for premature refills, dispensed more insulin pens than patients needed per their prescriptions, and falsely under-reported the days-of-supply of insulin that its pharmacies dispensed.
U.S. Attorney Jay Clayton said CVS engaged in a ""decade-long practice of repeatedly prematurely refilling insulin prescriptions for patients and improperly billing government healthcare programs for more insulin than patients needed.""
""These programs rely on pharmacies to follow appropriate refill schedules and to accurately report the amount of medicine dispensed, which CVS pharmacies frequently failed to do.
For several years, CVS management knew that insulin pens were among the drug products most frequently subject to chargebacks for premature refills.","CVS Health agreed to pay $37.76 million to settle allegations that it dispensed too many insulin pens to patients and improperly billed federal healthcare programs for those insulin prescriptions.

The settlement, which the Department of Justice announced Tuesday, resolves allegations that during a 10-year period, from 2010 through 2020, CVS violated the False Claims Act in connection with its billing and dispensing of insulin pens to patients enrolled in government healthcare programs, including Medicare, Medicaid, TRICARE and the Federal Employees Health Benefits Program.

The federal government alleged that CVS improperly requested and received reimbursement for premature refills, dispensed more insulin pens than patients needed per their prescriptions, and falsely under-reported the days-of-supply of insulin that its pharmacies dispensed.

Under the settlement approved by U.S. District Judge John G. Koeltl, CVS agreed to pay a total of $37.76 million, with $24.4 million to the United States and the remainder to various states.

As part of the settlement, CVS also admitted and accepted responsibility for certain conduct alleged by the government in its complaint, including that government healthcare programs ""paid CVS substantial amounts for insulin pen refills that were ineligible for reimbursement and CVS pharmacies dispensed more insulin to beneficiaries than they needed,"" the DOJ said in a press release.

In a statement, a CVS Health spokesperson said, ""While we do everything we can to ensure patients can access the medications they need, insulin pen billing has long been a challenge for pharmacies. Factors such as FDA labeling changes, no single pen packaging options, insulin dosing variability, and varying payor supply limits and instructions have made billing for these medications incredibly complex.""

""In recent years, the evolution of PBM and payor practices to account for insulin pen packaging and other technological enhancements have helped alleviate some of these challenges. With this settlement, we’re pleased to put this issue behind us and avoid the cost and expense of litigation,"" the retail pharmacy chain's spokesperson said.

U.S. Attorney Jay Clayton said CVS engaged in a ""decade-long practice of repeatedly prematurely refilling insulin prescriptions for patients and improperly billing government healthcare programs for more insulin than patients needed.""

""These programs rely on pharmacies to follow appropriate refill schedules and to accurately report the amount of medicine dispensed, which CVS pharmacies frequently failed to do. This settlement reflects our continued commitment to holding pharmacies to account, enforcing rules designed to keep costs down, and protecting taxpayer dollars,"" Clayton said in a statement.

In connection with the filing of the lawsuit and settlement, the federal government joined five private whistleblower lawsuits that had previously been filed under seal pursuant to the False Claims Act.

Federal authorities alleged in the lawsuit that from January 1, 2010 through December 31, 2020, CVS violated the False Claims Act by knowingly submitting, or causing to be submitted, false claims to government healthcare programs for reimbursement for insulin pens where CVS: dispensed more insulin to beneficiaries than was specified by their prescriptions and refilled beneficiary prescriptions substantially before they needed the refills; falsely under-reported the days-of-supply for the insulin refills, which often prevented pharmacy benefit managers from detecting that the refills were premature; and failed to comply with applicable rules when refilling insulin prescriptions requiring pharmacies to calculate refill dates using the actual days-of-supply dispensed.

According to the lawsuit, CVS instructed its pharmacy staff simply to report the maximum days-of-supply allowed under the beneficiary’s plan when dispensing full insulin pen cartons, which was often lower than the actual days-of-supply dispensed, federal authorities alleged. CVS pharmacy staff repeatedly refilled prescriptions prematurely, dispensing substantially more insulin to patients than they actually needed and substantially sooner than they needed it according to their prescriptions. As a result, some patients accumulated large quantities of unused insulin, which was both wasteful and potentially dangerous as insulin can expire, the DOJ said in its press release.

And federal authorities allege that CVS management was well aware that it was over-dispensing insulin. ""PBMs issued chargebacks to CVS based on these violations. For several years, CVS management knew that insulin pens were among the drug products most frequently subject to chargebacks for premature refills. Yet, despite these audit findings, CVS failed to take necessary steps to address this long-standing problem during the covered period,"" the DOJ said.",https://qtxasset.com/quartz/qcloud5/media/image/fiercebiotech/1644246264/CVS.jpg/CVS.jpg?VersionId=EvTpInYDLQKsPLlBgyV5G22fMgK_LNhx,N,0.0,2025-12-02 18:57:13.791334

WASHINGTON, D.C. – U.S. Senator Cindy Hyde-Smith (R-Miss.) on Monday cosponsored legislation to direct the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs to give veterans greater access to non-opioid alternatives.

The Non-Opioids Prevent Addiction in the Nation (NOPAIN) for Veterans Act (S.3209) would expand access for veterans by directing the VA to include FDA-approved non-opioid treatments in the VA National Formulary (VANF). The NOPAIN for Veterans Act would help put veterans on par with the care offered today to Medicare beneficiaries.

“It’s important that veterans have access to more pain treatment options beyond being prescribed opioids, which too often lead to misuse, addiction, and loss of life. The NOPAIN for Veterans Act would allow veterans to use proven non-opioid alternatives, which is why I support it wholeheartedly,” Senator Hyde-Smith said.

S.3209 was introduced by U.S. Senator Shelley Moore Capito (R-W.Va.), who has worked to expand access to non-opioid alternatives in response to the recent opioid overdose epidemic.

“Our veterans deserve the very best care we can provide, including safe and effective options to manage pain without exposing them to unnecessary risk,” Senator Capito said. “By ensuring FDA-approved non-opioid treatments are included on the VA National Formulary, our legislation will make these alternatives easier to prescribe and easier for veterans to access.”

S.3209 would build on the NOPAIN Act passed by Congress in 2022, which expanded Medicare enrollee access to non-opioid alternatives for postoperative pain. While TRICARE traditionally follows the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services policies on these matters, the VA has not taken similar action to expand access to non-opioid treatments through the VANF.

The VANF lists clinically reviewed products available for prescribing at all VA facilities, but any products or treatments not included on that formulary cannot be used without going through a “non-formulary request process.”

Additional NOPAIN for Veterans Act cosponsors include U.S. Senators Jeanne Shaheen (D-N.H.), Jim Banks (R-Ind.), Cory Booker (D-N.J.), Katie Britt (R-Ala.), Catherine Cortez Masto (D-Nev.), Kevin Cramer (R-N.D.), Kirsten Gillibrand (D-N.Y.), Bill Hagerty (R-Tenn.), John Hoeven (R-N.D.), Jim Justice (R-W.Va.), Tim Kaine (D-Va.), Mark Kelly (D-Ariz.), Angus King (I-Maine), Amy Klobuchar (D-Minn.), Pete Ricketts (R-Neb.), Jackie Rosen (D-Nev.), Tim Scott (R-S.C.), and Chris Van Hollen (D-Md.).

Which health plan is right for me?

Your TRICARE health plan options depend on who you are and where you live. If you have multiple options, think about how you prefer to get care and how this affects your out-of-pocket costs. Also keep in mind that family members don’t all need to be enrolled in the same TRICARE plan.

Here’s how to learn more about your options and decide which plan is right for you.

Check the TRICARE Plan Finder to see which plans you may be eligible for.

Use the Compare Plans Tool to compare plans side by side.

Go to Health Plan Costs to compare 2026 out-of-pocket costs for TRICARE Prime and TRICARE Select.

Use the Find a Doctor Tool to find military hospitals and clinics and TRICARE network providers near you.

How do I make changes?

There are three ways to enroll in a TRICARE health plan or change your plan:

Online: Go to milConnect.

By phone: Call your TRICARE regional contractor or designated provider.

By enrollment form: Mail or fax an enrollment form to your TRICARE regional contractor or designated provider.

Looking for step-by-step instructions, contact information, and enrollment forms? Go to Enroll or Purchase a Plan, choose the plan you want to enroll in, and follow the steps to enroll.

What if I don’t make changes during open season?

Are you happy with your current TRICARE coverage? You don’t need to do anything during TRICARE Open Season. If you’re already enrolled in a plan and you don’t make changes, you’ll continue in your current health plan as long as you’re eligible.

If you aren’t already in a plan and you don’t enroll in one during open season, you’ll only be eligible for care at a military hospital or clinic, if space is available.

Outside of TRICARE Open Season, you only can enroll in or change enrollment to a TRICARE Prime option or TRICARE Select if you have a QLE. Certain life changes open a 90-day window when you can change your TRICARE health plan. Common QLEs include moving, getting married, and having a baby.

The government accused the business of billing TRICARE hundreds of dollars more per breast pump than it charged to the state’s Medicaid program as well as billing TRICARE separately for breast pump accessories that were included in the standard kit.
She said she entered into the settlement agreement because “for a small business to go up against the government is … that’s not going to be a fair situation for the small business.
They have a lot more money than I do.” The Breastfeeding Shop continues to be a provider for TRICARE, she added.
“And I’m an optimist by nature, and I love helping new and expecting moms.","A Lehigh Valley breast pump and maternity product provider will pay $1 million to settle federal allegations of false reimbursement claims.

Scottie Girl LLC, doing business as The Breastfeeding Shop with a location at 431 Chestnut St. in Emmaus, and owner Patty Gatter will pay the money as a part of a settlement agreement with the United States, according to a Dec. 1 news release from U.S. Attorney David Metcalf of the Eastern District of Pennsylvania.

According to the U.S. Attorney’s Office, the agreement resolves allegations that The Breastfeeding Shop submitted false claims for reimbursement for breast pumps and related equipment for beneficiaries of TRICARE, the health care program managed by the Defense Health Agency for U.S. military members, retirees and their families.

The government accused the business of billing TRICARE hundreds of dollars more per breast pump than it charged to the state’s Medicaid program as well as billing TRICARE separately for breast pump accessories that were included in the standard kit.

“Fraud involving TRICARE, the healthcare system for military members and their families, is something we take seriously and will investigate fully,” Christopher Silvestro, acting special agent in charge of the Defense Criminal Investigative Service Northeast Field Office, said in the release.

The settlement did not require the business to admit to wrongdoing, and in an interview Gatter told The Morning Call that the actions were unintentional and the result of incorrect guidance from contractors who administered the benefit when it began being offered in 2015. She said when TRICARE provided updated guidance, she complied immediately.

She said she entered into the settlement agreement because “for a small business to go up against the government is … that’s not going to be a fair situation for the small business. They have a lot more money than I do.”

The Breastfeeding Shop continues to be a provider for TRICARE, she added.

“My passion for growing my company is alive and well,” Gatter said. “And I’m an optimist by nature, and I love helping new and expecting moms. So … I take this very seriously. The fact that I went through something, for me, that was overwhelming but continue to be a valued partner helps me kind of come to terms that unfortunately, things like this are the norm in this world, even though it’s a hard lesson to learn. And rather than being afraid of it, I have to be open, honest and transparent and move forward and be helpful to the insurance companies.”

U.S. Attorney David Metcalf announced the agreement on Thursday, marking a decisive federal response to what investigators described as years of improper billing practices tied to breast pumps and related equipment provided to military service members, retirees, and their families.

According to the allegations, The Breastfeeding Shop billed TRICARE hundreds of dollars more per breast pump than it charged Pennsylvania’s Medicaid program, a practice the government says amounted to an unlawful dual fee schedule. Prosecutors also claimed the company “unbundled” pre-packaged breast pump accessories — billing TRICARE separately for items already included in standard kits.

“Durable medical equipment suppliers play a vital role in providing safe and effective medical products to patients in need, and especially to our brave service members and their families,” Metcalf said. “As alleged, The Breastfeeding Shop and Gatter prioritized their own financial interests through a billing scheme that was to the detriment of the government. This conduct will not be tolerated by my office.”

The settlement covers alleged misconduct from the early rollout of TRICARE’s 2015 benefit expansion, which began covering breast pumps and supplies for nursing mothers. Federal officials said the improper billing inflated costs at a time when the program was working to expand access to essential equipment for new military parents.

Christopher M. Silvestro, Acting Special Agent in Charge of the Defense Criminal Investigative Service Northeast Field Office, said the agreement reflects years of cooperation between the Department of Defense Office of Inspector General and the Justice Department.

“Fraud involving TRICARE, the healthcare system for military members and their families, is something we take seriously and will investigate fully,” Silvestro said.

Dr. Glen Diehl, Acting Deputy Director of the Defense Health Agency, said safeguarding the program’s integrity is central to protecting service members, veterans, and their families.

“This settlement sends a clear message that we will not tolerate practices that exploit the program and inflate costs at the expense of our service members, veterans, and their families,” Diehl said. “Access to essential medical equipment, like breast pumps, is vital for the health and well-being of new mothers and infants within our TRICARE community.”

The investigation was led by the Defense Criminal Investigative Service, with the case handled by Assistant U.S. Attorney Judith Amorosa and former Auditor Dawn Wiggins of the Eastern District of Pennsylvania.

Little Walter Reed Hospital Communications Bringing together leaders in military medicine, research, and patient care, the John P. Murtha Cancer Center (MCC) at Walter Reed recently hosted its annual Breast Cancer Awareness Summit at the Uniformed Services University (USU). The event focused on new discoveries and compassionate care shaping the future of breast cancer research and treatment across the Military Health System (MHS).

Speakers addressed fertility preservation in oncology, intimacy after diagnosis, and innovations in breast surgery and radiation therapy (RT). They also explored how scientific progress is reducing the need for invasive procedures while improving survivorship and quality of life.

A breast cancer diagnosis does not automatically end a service member’s career, noted Dr. Craig Shriver, MCC director and director of the MCC Research Programs. However, it can impact readiness by requiring the service member to spend extended time away from duty for treatment.

U.S. Air Force Lt. Col. (Dr.) Robert Krell, a surgical oncologist at Walter Reed, explained that axillary surgery for breast cancer may not be necessary in many cases thanks to advances in treatment and a clearer understanding of tumor biology. Providers can minimize harm through sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) and targeted axillary dissection (TAD). SLNB removes the sentinel nodes, the first lymph nodes in the drainage path from the breast tumor, while TAD removes specific lymph nodes known to contain cancer.

“Randomized controlled trials have demonstrated safety of sentinel node biopsy omission in early-stage cancers,” Krell stated. “Minimizing unnecessary axillary surgery should translate into improved patient survivorship.” Dr. Sonali Rudra, director of the Breast Cancer Radiation Oncology Program at MedStar Georgetown University School of Medicine, agreed, adding that increasing data supports less invasive approaches. She explained that in “the era of de-escalation,” radiation treatment planning is shifting toward lower doses to reduce toxicity and protect critical organs, especially for early-stage cancers with favorable prognoses.

A breast cancer diagnosis can also affect sexual health and intimacy, explained Jennifer Reese, associate professor in the Cancer Prevention and Control Program at Temple University School of Medicine’s Fox Chase Cancer Center. “Be open, direct and up front about your wants and needs,” she advised those experiencing breast cancer, emphasizing that clear communication between patients/survivors and their partners is essential with addressing medical and psychological concerns, including depression and anxiety.

U.S. Navy Lt. Cmdr. (Dr.) Allison Eubanks and U.S. Army Maj. Kiley Hunkler, clinical fellows in Reproductive Endocrinology and Infertility at Walter Reed, discussed integrating reproductive planning into cancer care. They encouraged providers to counsel patients about potential infertility risks before treatment and refer them early for fertility preservation options such as oocyte, embryo, or tissue cryopreservation. They noted that TRICARE covers fertility preservation under some conditions and that early coordination helps prevent delays.

Geeta Upadhyay, scientific director of the MCCRP Clinical Breast Care Project, shared her team’s research on targeted therapies for triple negative breast cancer (TNBC), which does not respond to traditional cancer medication. Her team is investigating how blocking abnormal molecules, or biomarkers, like Ly6K may help the body’s immune system fight cancer more effectively.

Some studies suggest that active-duty women may have a higher rate of developing breast cancer than their civilian peers, potentially linked to cumulative environmental exposures. MCC and MCCRP continue advancing cancer research and treatment to enhance readiness and improve outcomes for military beneficiaries. The annual summit helps in leading these efforts by uniting experts to share discoveries, refine treatment strategies, and strengthen the continuum of care from diagnosis through survivorship.

Air Force Capt.
The former U.S. Air Force air traffic controller overcame adversity to become a military doctor.","The sky was never the limit for Air Force Capt. (Dr.) Lindsay Slimski — it was only the beginning.

After a difficult childhood, she enlisted in the U.S. Air Force in 2005 — helping planes take off but never leaving her lifelong dream behind. A unique program from the Uniformed Services University would take her there.

A turbulent upbringing, a new start

In her youth, she lived with extended family, friends, “moving around from home to home, going to school, working, getting straight A’s, but on my own. It was just wherever I could get support,” she said.

As her mother struggled with mental health challenges, Slimski went to “the hospital with her and watched how supportive the medical people were … every step of the way. Seeing the length that people were going to, to help somebody in need really stuck with me.”

Through that experience, she started developing her passion to help people. “I just wanted to bring it forward and help in other ways. Going to medical school was always my dream.”

She tried college, but “I had no one to look to for any guidance on how to do anything … nobody in my family had ever gone to college. I dropped out after a year and thought, ‘OK, I'll join the Air Force because that kind of seems like a good option for me to jump start.’”

Enlisting in the U.S. Air Force “opened up a lot of doors to me that I don't think I would have known about or even how to pursue,” she said.

She trained as an air traffic controller, a demanding role. “It was a great career. I really enjoyed it because it was fast paced,” she said. “You have to be able to think quickly, process information, and change plans. I always had one thought: ‘Maybe one day I could use this to figure out how to become a doctor.’”

While serving at Nellis Air Force Base, Nevada, and Joint Base Pearl Harbor-Hickam, Hawaii, Slimski took college classes and got a degree in aeronautics. She also took prerequisite medical school coursework but working night shifts and rotating schedules made completing it impossible. Then she read an article about a new program at the Uniformed Services University of the Health Sciences called the Enlisted to Medical Degree Preparatory Program, known as EMDP2.

The highly competitive program is a two-year academic journey towards medical school, designed to help promising, motivated enlisted personnel from across the military services become future military doctors. EMDP2 offers an intensive pre-medical program, mentoring, and Medical College Admission Test preparation. The program also allows service members to maintain their current rank, pay and benefits while going to school full-time at George Mason University’s Prince William County Campus in Virginia.

“As soon as I saw it, I thought it sounded like the perfect program for me because it would solve these issues. I could finish this,” she said.

She applied and was accepted. While eight months pregnant Slimski began school as the first and only woman in the program’s inaugural 2014 class of 10 students.

“It was all men that first year, except for me,” she said. “It just felt like a normal military experience, because a lot of times you end up being the only female.”

Two weeks into the program, she gave birth to her daughter, Kailani. “I ended up taking a week off with the newborn and then played catch-up basically for that week because it is such a rigorous schedule,” Slimski said. Her mother-in-law stepped in to help while her husband, Donald, an air traffic controller himself, was stationed several hours away and then on a remote assignment, so she was able to complete pre-medicine classes with her cohort.

The EMDP2 provided “a much stronger bond” than other preparatory programs, she felt, and “everybody feels like they're connected, and they want other people to succeed and are just very supportive and making sure they can succeed. Honestly, it was pretty incredible.”

She also went to Maxwell Air Force Base, Alabama for commissioned officer training. “I learned about the leadership role, but I'm not really big at leading drills because I really don't have that loud, projecting voice. But I got more leadership focus, so that was more interesting and fun.”

Slimski was accepted into medical school at USU while pregnant with her second daughter, Ellayah, and caring for Kailani and her two stepchildren. While juggling family life and relocating, she credited the program with setting her up for success. “The program was a really good, solid foundation for medical school. They walked us through all of the application steps, so you can check the boxes. It was foolproof.”

Family medicine with purpose

When it came time to select her specialty, Slimski chose family medicine. “Family medicine is really great in that it’s kind of a little bit of everything,” she said.

Slimski, a mother of two and a stepmom, is now a Military Health System family medicine physician with the 1st Special Operations Medical Group - Hurlburt Field, Florida. She cares for active duty service members while supporting high operational demands.

“It’s really rewarding because there is a really high-ops tempo here and … they really do push the mission and readiness,” she said. “I really do enjoy it a lot. It’s challenging.”

Slimski said her enlisted background and an “ingrained” sense to complete the mission has shaped her success in the medical field.

“We have an extra military bearing and realization that what we do has an effect on people and we know how to carry forward. Basically, we know what we’re supposed to do when we’re supposed to do it,” she said. “I think (service members) have more of a deeper understanding of the fact that what they do has an impact in the long run.”

Yet it’s more than just fulfilling mission requirements for Slimski — it’s about resilience in the face of adversity.

“There are a lot of things that can happen throughout our lives, and you can’t really let things hold you back,” she said. “You just have to keep that mindset, no matter what happens and think, ‘I’m going to push myself to move forward. The opportunities are there. You have to go for it.”

Access to essential medical equipment, like breast pumps, is vital for the health and well-being of new mothers and infants within our TRICARE community. We thank the U.S. Attorney’s Office and the Defense Criminal Investigative Service for their continuing dedication to the pursuit of justice.”

The case was handled by Assistant United States Attorney Judith Amorosa and former Auditor Dawn Wiggins from the Eastern District of Pennsylvania with an investigation conducted by agents from Defense Criminal Investigative Services at the Department of Defense.

By 2007, Wreaths Across America (WAA) had been officially established as a nonprofit organization with a clear and enduring mission: Remember the fallen.
A Movement Grows Today, Wreaths Across America coordinates events in more than 4,000 locations across all 50 states and American cemeteries abroad.
For USBA, Wreaths Across America is more than a tradition—it’s a reflection of our mission to remember, honor, and teach.
Each December, our team joins thousands of others in laying wreaths across the country, united by gratitude and respect.","The air was cold, cold enough that my breath came out in white puffs as I walked among the headstones, each one bearing a wreath with green branches and a red ribbon.

I carried a wreath, searching for an empty headstone. I walked over, passing by another volunteer, before taking a knee and silently laying the wreath against the marker. Once fixed, I read the name of the soldier laid to rest, thanking them for their service to our country.

This was not my first time participating in Wreaths Across America, but something felt different this time. The stillness. The scale. The shared reverence in every step. For the first time, I truly felt the weight of what this tradition meant. And it left me wondering: how did it all begin?

The Humble Beginning

In 1992, Morrill Worcester, owner of the Worcester Wreath Company in Maine, found himself with a surplus of wreaths at the end of the holiday season. Rather than let them go to waste, he remembered a childhood trip to Arlington National Cemetery, a visit that left a lasting impression. With help from volunteers and a local trucking company, Worcester arranged to place the leftover wreaths at Arlington’s older, less-visited graves. No media, no fanfare, just a heartfelt gesture to honor those who had served.

That quiet tribute might have remained a personal tradition, but in 2005, a photo of the wreath-lined headstones at Arlington went viral. The image struck a chord across the country, with thousands of people wanting to help. By 2007, Wreaths Across America (WAA) had been officially established as a nonprofit organization with a clear and enduring mission: Remember the fallen. Honor those who serve. Teach the next generation the value of freedom.

A Movement Grows

Today, Wreaths Across America coordinates events in more than 4,000 locations across all 50 states and American cemeteries abroad. In 2024 alone, over 3 million wreaths were placed on veterans’ graves, thanks to the efforts of more than four million volunteers.

But it’s not just about numbers—it’s about community. Local fundraising teams, schoolchildren, Gold Star families, civic organizations, and veterans’ groups all come together to support WAA’s mission.

For military families, veterans, and the organizations that support them, WAA represents a collective pause—a shared ritual of gratitude. Whether standing in snow, silence, or the warmth of sunlight, every wreath placed is a promise not to forget those who served our nation.

USBA’s Involvement

That promise is what brings us back, year after year. For USBA, Wreaths Across America is more than a tradition—it’s a reflection of our mission to remember, honor, and teach. Each December, our team joins thousands of others in laying wreaths across the country, united by gratitude and respect.

But the effort begins long before the wreaths are placed. Volunteers prepare, routes are planned, and families like yours consider how to get involved. This season, we invite you to be part of USBA’s commitment to the mission.

You can:

Sponsor a wreath in honor of a loved one

Volunteer at a participating cemetery

Involve your family and community in preserving this legacy

Every voice, every name, every wreath matters. To sponsor directly through USBA’s Wreaths Across America page, visit wreathsacrossamerica.org. Together, we can ensure the service and sacrifice of our nation’s heroes are never forgotten.

currently supports the TRICARE Prime® Demonstration in Atlanta, Georgia, and Tampa, Florida—two cities with strong military communities. Insights from this effort are helping shape future approaches to care coordination and access. In 2026, CSMV will deepen its presence in both markets, continuing its mission to support military families through every transition.

“From a national security perspective, health care is a key piece of readiness,” said CSMV President and proud military spouse Holly Joers. “Family readiness is military readiness. Ultimately, I’d like to see health care options like this available nationwide.”

CSMV is built on understanding, from a first person perspective, the unique needs of the military community; veterans carry many health conditions directly connected to their service, while military families bear the burden of losing healthcare continuity from continuous moves. CareSource, a nonprofit health insurance company, brings decades of experience supporting those enrolled in government-sponsored programs.

“I’m the proud spouse of a retired Air Force officer and daughter of an Army veteran,” Joers said. “I began my career at Eglin Air Force Base as a young military spouse. This is more than a job; it’s a calling. Because I’m part of this community, I understand the complexities of military life. I’m proud to serve those who serve our country.”

Pamela Drake, an Army veteran, military spouse, and CSMV military affairs representative in Tampa, Florida, added, “I felt a call to serve at 17. Now, I serve by helping others navigate a system that can be complex to navigate, especially during transitions. Choice, innovation, and competition drive excellence. I’m ready to live the difference.”

CSMV is focused on removing common barriers like requiring referrals for in-network specialists, which is often a time-consuming process that leaves many families frustrated.

“We’re building health care that works with military life,” said Elisa Henry, an Air Force veteran spouse and CSMV military affairs representative in Atlanta, Georgia. She added that CSMV also provides virtual care, flexible options and “real support from people who speak your language.”

Drake highlighted the organization’s focus and emphasis on both cultural competency and education.

“We engage in training, research, and direct outreach. As one of the subject matter experts, I actively educate others on military life to ensure our teams are well-positioned to serve this community,” she said.

Lakesha Cole, a retired Marine Corps spouse of 23 years and mother of three, including a child with complex medical needs, understands the unique challenges of health care better than most. Cole has weathered eight deployments, six PCS moves and a complex diagnosis journey with her daughter, Kirby.

“Every move meant starting over, re-explaining everything and hoping we didn’t lose ground. What helped most wasn’t just good doctors; it was people who listened,” Cole said. “What gives me hope about CSMV is their effort to understand military families’ different health care needs.”

CSMV is also active throughout the community through deep-rooted partnerships with organizations like Blue Star Families, Hiring Our Heroes and other military-focused nonprofits.

“Our goal is to serve across every stage of life,” Joers said. “Whether you’re active duty, retired, a caregiver, or a survivor, we’re here to support families through every stage of service.”

Cole’s hope for the future of military health care is simple but powerful. “We don’t need perfection. We need support that works with us, not against us. Supportive care makes all the difference when families are carrying so much already.”

Henry wants to ensure that military spouses feel seen.

“I would like to speak to military spouses: you’re serving, too. Your sacrifice matters and you deserve health care that recognizes that. We’re here as people who understand your life because we’ve lived it, too,” she said. “We want to be partners in keeping your family healthy so you can focus on everything else you’re managing. Thank you for your service and for trusting us with your health care.”

“You are heard by us,” Drake added. “Use your voice. Tell us what you need. This is your care.”

Joers echoed that sentiment. “We’re listening. We’re building something better, together.”

Joe DeBold, the district’s director of guidance, presented the Cornwall Central School District Board of Education with a K–12 comprehensive school counseling plan and described several measures administrators say are raising student engagement.

DeBold said the plan centers on three domains — academics, college and career, and social-emotional learning — and follows American School Counselor Association standards. He described the district’s ‘‘delivery by level’’ documentation, which lists activities by target group, tier, staff assignment and timeline.

On social-emotional learning, DeBold said the district is in year three of teaching dialectical behavior techniques (DBT) across grade levels, with monthly lessons delivered by support staff. He offered classroom examples — including a stoplight exercise and a ‘‘wise mind’’ framing — and credited PPS leadership for advancing the work.

DeBold also reported that a recently hired mental-health clinician has begun taking referrals at the middle and high school levels. He said intake and insurance paperwork slow some placements; two parents declined services and two additional referrals were affected by TRICARE insurance denials, but staff continue to work with those families.

To show impact, DeBold used attendance as a straightforward metric. He said quarter‑to‑quarter counts of students with five or more absences fell in multiple buildings: Cornwall Central High School from 151 to 123; Cornwall Central Middle School from 117 to 64; Cornwall Elementary School from 117 to 73; COH from 45 to 23; and Willow from 44 to 22. ""If they step foot in our building, we can get our hands on them,"" he said, arguing improved attendance creates opportunities for connection and intervention.

On academics, DeBold reviewed AP participation and scores since the pandemic and said the district now has 277 AP students with a higher rate of students scoring 3 or better on exams. He said the district’s approach encourages students to take more rigorous courses and to sit for exams; DeBold noted many districts discourage taking exams for all enrolled AP students, while Cornwall Central typically tests all AP students.

DeBold described partnerships and college-credit opportunities, including dual-enrollment classes with Marist College and a senior-year option to earn SUNY Oneonta credit in AP Government/Politics. He also highlighted career pathways such as CTEC participation and a new internship course scheduled for a soft launch in 2026.

DeBold introduced Project Lead The Way (PLTW), an engineering and career pathway, and said technology teacher Jacques Ponsole secured a $30,000 grant (reported as $15,000 this year and $15,000 next) to cover teacher training and initial equipment. DeBold said the district plans to seek additional grants to expand PLTW offerings.

Board members asked for additional data: one member requested underlying AP-exam composition and regional comparisons; DeBold agreed to provide further breakdowns. Members also discussed limits to alumni tracking and low response rates to graduate surveys; DeBold said the district is exploring alumni events and incentives to improve follow-up data.

The presentation closed with board members praising the outreach and student engagement strategies and asking for regular updates and supporting data.

Next steps: DeBold offered to share the requested AP composition and additional outcome data with the board.

In effect, it forbids PBMs from owning pharmacies altogether — even in cases where such ownership improves efficiency or access.
If evidence shows that PBMs are engaging in practices that disadvantage patients or small pharmacies, then targeted, sensible regulation may be warranted.
The court recognized what should be obvious: states cannot enact laws that discriminate against out-of-state companies or interfere with federal programs.
He previously served as a Commissioner on Oklahoma’s Patient’s Right to Pharmacy Choice Commission.","Oklahomans know all too well that the rising cost of prescription drugs can strain any household budget. For many families, the question isn’t just about money — it’s about health, independence, and peace of mind. Policymakers are right to look for solutions that make medications more affordable, but in doing so, we must take care not to make the system worse in the name of reform.

One idea now rumored to be circulating at the State Capitol would follow the path of our neighbor Arkansas, which last year passed a law known as Act 624 that effectively bans Pharmacy Benefit Managers (PBMs) from owning or operating pharmacies. While the intent behind such measures — lowering costs and improving access — may be noble, the result in Arkansas has been confusion, litigation, and unintended harm to veterans and rural residents who rely on mail-order prescriptions. Oklahoma should not make the same mistake.

That law, signed last year, prohibits any PBM from obtaining a pharmacy permit in the state. In effect, it forbids PBMs from owning pharmacies altogether — even in cases where such ownership improves efficiency or access. The legislation’s sponsors claimed it would “improve healthcare delivery,” but its real-world impact has been the opposite.

At the most basic level PBMs are hired by health insurers to negotiate prices with drug manufacturers and ensure networks of pharmacies where patients can fill prescriptions. This helps keep costs competitive for consumers, employers, and taxpayers alike.

If evidence shows that PBMs are engaging in practices that disadvantage patients or small pharmacies, then targeted, sensible regulation may be warranted. Investigations and oversight efforts have been launched in many states — including here in Oklahoma — to ensure that these entities operate transparently and in the best interests of patients. As a former PBM regulator in the state, I know first-hand how important it is to keep that balance, but broad bans like Arkansas’ Act 624 go far beyond what is necessary or legal and could harm the very people that it claims to be helping.

One of the clearest examples is the effect on TRICARE, the federal healthcare program that serves active-duty military, veterans, and their families. TRICARE contracts with a PBM that also owns a mail-order pharmacy to deliver maintenance medications to service members across the country — particularly those in rural areas, far from brick-and-mortar pharmacies. Under Arkansas’s law, this arrangement would be explicitly banned. That means veterans who depend on mail-order prescriptions would lose a lifeline, forcing them to travel long distances or face delays in receiving critical medications.

It’s no surprise that the law has been challenged on constitutional grounds and that a federal judge in the Eastern District of Arkansas has blocked its enforcement. The court recognized what should be obvious: states cannot enact laws that discriminate against out-of-state companies or interfere with federal programs. The Constitution’s Commerce Clause bars states from erecting barriers to interstate commerce, and the Supremacy Clause ensures that federal programs like TRICARE remain free from conflicting state restrictions.

The lesson for Oklahoma is simple. Our leaders should pursue policies that make prescription drugs more affordable — but they should do so by examining the full range of causes behind rising costs, not by taking cues from Arkansas. Restricting operations of companies that negotiate with drug companies for lower prices won’t solve the problem. In fact, it risks removing one of the few entities actively working to control prices and streamline access to needed medicines.

Cox Automotive projects a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 15.7 million, slightly ahead of October but below last year’s 16.5 million. Sales volume is forecast to reach 1.27 million units, down 1 per cent from October and nearly 8 per cent year over year. Fewer selling days (25 this month) account for part of the decline.

“The new-vehicle sales pace had been expected to slow in the fourth quarter, and that’s what we are seeing,” said Charlie Chesbrough, Senior Economist at Cox Automotive, in a statement. “The headwinds from higher prices and fewer government subsidies for electric vehicles are finally slowing the market after a surprisingly strong previous six months.”

Chesbrough added that sales started to surge in the spring as consumers rushed to market to beat what they anticipated would inevitably be higher prices in the wake of announced tariffs. “Now, with more tariffed products replacing existing non-tariffed inventory, prices are drifting higher, leading to slower sales which may last through the remainder of the year and into next year.”

Cox Automotive said the recent pullback in EV demand is playing a central role. After three strong months, October saw a sharp reversal as the federal EV tax credit expired.

“Sales of EVs and PHEVs accelerated in the wake of the Big Beautiful Bill’s passage in early July as buyers rushed to market before the $7,500 tax credits expired at the end of September,” said Chesbrough. “Q3 was the strongest quarter ever for EVs; however, Q4 is a different story. Sales of EVs and plug-in hybrids are now collapsing after tax credits expired.”

Hearing Aids TRICARE only covers hearing aids if the patient has profound hearing loss.","Portable CPAP Machines, Sensory Integration Training, Sleep Studies, Hearing Aids, and Home Infusions

This page covers how the TRICARE West Region covers travel continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) machines, sensory integration training, sleep studies, hearing aids, and home infusions.

Portable CPAP Machines

TRICARE covers portable or travel CPAP machines if the patient meets the following conditions:

The patient is an active duty service member (ADSM)

The patient has a referral that specifies these three items:

They have an obstructive sleep apnea diagnosis.

They travel on official business at least three days per month, or they are about to be deployed.

They are not going to retire or separate from the military within the year.

The patient can get a CPAP machine from the following sources:

Sleep specialist

Pulmonary medicine

Sleep lab

Other providers with expertise in sleep disorders

All portable CPAP machines must have humidification capabilities and use portable batteries. Only active duty service members can receive authorizations for portable CPAP machines. To qualify, the service member must meet one of the following criteria:

The service member is deploying.

The service member is traveling for official business at least three days per month.

If the ADSM already has a CPAP machine for home use, TRICARE can still authorize a portable CPAP machine if they meet the above criteria.

If TRICARE authorizes the ADSM to receive a portable CPAP machine and the ADSM doesn’t have a standard CPAP machine, the ADSM will only receive authorization for a portable CPAP machine.

All providers referring their patients for portable CPAP machines must document that their patient has obstructive sleep apnea and meets TRICARE travel requirements.

For more information on how TRICARE covers CPAP machines, visit the TRICARE CPAP Machine page.

Sensory Integration Training

Sensory integration training (SIT) is an occupational therapy approach that uses structured, play-based, sensory-motor activities to improve a child’s adaptive responses to sensory experiences and functional participation. Occupational therapists typically provide this and deliver in clinics equipped with sensory-rich equipment.

SIT, which may be considered a component of cognitive rehabilitation, is not a proven therapy. TRICARE does not pay for SIT by itself or with other therapies, such as occupational, physical, or speech therapy.

Sleep Studies

Providers can use sleep studies to monitor a patient's sleep cycle and diagnose any potential sleep problems. Sleep studies can help diagnose conditions including, but not limited to, the following:

Narcolepsy

Obstructive sleep apnea syndrome

Impotence

Abnormal sleep behavior, such as sleepwalking, bruxism, and more

Under TRICARE, ADSMs who need a sleep study must get a referral. Referrals for sleep studies can come from the patient’s primary care manager (PCM) or a specialty provider. TRICARE policy specifies the following priority order for where the ADSM should get the sleep study:

A Military Treatment Facility (MTF) sleep laboratory

A network sleep laboratory

A non-network, TRICARE-authorized sleep laboratory

A sleep study conducted at home if travel to a sleep laboratory is not possible

Keep in mind that a sleep disorder diagnosis may affect the ADSM's ability to be deployed, readiness, and disability status, which may lead to their discharge from service.

For more information on sleep studies, visit the TRICARE Sleep Studies page and the Sleep Studies Quick Reference Guide.

Hearing Aids

TRICARE only covers hearing aids if the patient has profound hearing loss. To qualify as having profound hearing loss, the patient must meet these conditions:

Adults must have at least one of the following conditions:

A hearing threshold of at least 40 dB HL in one or both ears when tested at 500, 1000, 1500, 2000, 3000, or 4000Hz

A hearing threshold of at least 26 dB HL in one or both ears at any three or more of the above frequencies

A speech recognition score less than 94%

Children must have the following condition:

A hearing threshold of at least 26 dB HL in one or both ears when tested at 500, 1000, 1500, 2000, 3000, or 4000Hz

TRICARE does not cover hearing aids for retirees. However, retirees may obtain hearing aids through other government programs. These programs include:

The Department of Veterans Affairs

The Retiree-At-Cost Hearing Aid Program (RACHAP)

Through RACHAP, beneficiaries may be able to buy hearing aids for a reduced cost at certain military hospitals and clinics. To qualify, the beneficiary must be eligible for care at a military hospital or clinic. The military hospital or clinic provides the fitting and follow-up services. Participation in RACHAP may depend on the following:

Space

Equipment

Provider availability

Contact your military hospital or clinic to check availability.

TRICARE only covers hearing aids and hearing aid services for children of retired service members if the child meets the following criteria:

Has hearing loss that meets the specified hearing criteria listed above

Is enrolled in TRICARE Prime or US Family Health Plan

Has a living sponsor

Meets one of the following age requirements:

Under 21 years old

A full-time college aged 21-23

Unable to support themselves due to a disability that started before age 21 (or before age 23 if they were a student when the disability began)

For more information on hearing aid coverage, visit the TRICARE Hearing Aids page.

Note: TRICARE does not cover hearing aids for tinnitus if the patient does not have profound hearing loss.

Home Infusion Therapy

TRICARE authorizes home infusion therapy for homebound patients and, in limited situations, for non-homebound patients for limited periods of time.

Home infusion therapy may include the following:

Skilled nursing services to administer the drug

Drug compounding services

Medical supplies and durable equipment

The requirements vary depending upon whether a patient is homebound or non-homebound.

Homebound Beneficiaries

Providers should confirm the criteria listed in Chapter 12 of the TRICARE Reimbursement Manual (TRM) are met for homebound beneficiaries receiving Home Health Care under a Plan of Care.

Homebound beneficiaries who require skilled services (e.g., skilled nursing) for administering a home infusion drug must receive those skilled services from a Home Health Agency. Homebound beneficiaries who desire to self-administer (or have a caregiver administer) an infusion drug obtained from a TRICARE-authorized pharmacy under the TRICARE Pharmacy (TPharm) contract may do so when a physician or other authorized individual professional provider certifies that self-administration is medically appropriate. The physician or other authorized provider will document this certification in the patient’s POC or in their medical record.

Note: See TRM, Chapter 2, Addendum A for beneficiary cost-shares for HHC services. See TRM, Chapter 2, Addendum B for beneficiary cost-shares for the TPharm Benefits Program.

Non-Homebound Beneficiaries

Providers must submit preauthorization for non-homebound beneficiaries to receive home infusion therapy when the beneficiary needs long-term infusion therapy services (more than five sequential infusions). Home infusion therapy will be preauthorized when all of the following criteria are met:

The attending physician certifies that the beneficiary, or caregiver, is capable and willing to learn to self-administer.

The provider determines that self-administration in the home is medically appropriate.

The TRICARE-authorized provider has preauthorization for up to five sequential skilled nursing visits to administer and instruct the beneficiary or caregiver to self-administer the drug.

The provider coordinates and provides a referral to the TPharm for the drug and compounding services. If not available through TPharm, the provider supplies the drug through an appropriate TRICARE authorized provider or directs the beneficiary to care in an alternative setting.

The provider ensures the beneficiary has a referral to all medically necessary and appropriate services and supplies for infusion therapy in the home.",https://tricare.triwest.com/Static/tricare-favicon.ico,N,1.0,2025-12-02 10:56:53.562078

Key Takeaways: Data from the Defense Health Agency show a decline in military abortions between 2021 and the first half of 2025.
The records show that both surgical abortions and abortions by pill dropped between 2021 and the first half of 2025.
The Biden administration claimed that pro-life laws enacted after the fall of Roe amounted to a ""medical emergency.""
Why It Matters: According to Jody Duffy, RN, a former Army officer and military spouse of 35 years, the number of abortions among military women is not fully known.","Records from the Defense Health Agency that were shared with The Dallas Express appear to show a massive drop in abortions carried out on military members and their dependents.

Key Takeaways:

Data from the Defense Health Agency show a decline in military abortions between 2021 and the first half of 2025.

In 2022, the Biden administration enacted rules to increase abortion access in the military, including allowing the VA to commit abortions and mandating that the Department of Defense fund abortion travel.

After Trump took office in January, he and his administration began dismantling Biden's pro-abortion policies.

The Details:

In response to a Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) request, on November 20, the Defense Health Agency released data that reflect abortions ""performed or funded consistent with Title 10, United States Code, Section 1093."" Title 10 allows the federal funding of abortions when the child has been conceived in rape or incest or the life of the mother ""would be endangered.""

The records show that both surgical abortions and abortions by pill dropped between 2021 and the first half of 2025. According to TRICARE, there were 35 abortions in private-sector care in 2021, while there were just two from January through June 11, 2025. Direct-care abortions dropped from 14 in 2021 to three in the first half of 2025.

""We know that the Biden administration used every lever at its disposal to push unlimited abortion and this included policy changes in the military,"" The National Right to Life (NRTL) told The Dallas Express. ""Under the Trump administration, policies pushing abortion have been nullified or reversed.""

NRTL explained, “The law is very clear: taxpayer dollars and military facilities cannot be used for elective abortions. When that standard is followed and enforced, it naturally limits the number of abortions performed.”

The Backstory:

After Roe v. Wade was overturned in June 2022, the Biden administration allowed abortions to be commited at VA hospitals for the first time. Among other pro-abortion efforts, Biden also enacted an executive order mandating that the Department of Defense (DOD) fund abortion travel for military members.

The Biden administration claimed that pro-life laws enacted after the fall of Roe amounted to a ""medical emergency."" Dr. Shereef Elnahal, then the VA’s Under Secretary for Health, said the VA must commit abortions and the DOD must fund abortions in order to save women’s lives. Induced abortion — the intentional, targeted killing of a preborn child — is not medically necessary, does not improve maternal mortality or morbidity rates, and is not health care.

At the time, a spokesperson for the VA said the Biden-era policy was “politically motivated. It was estimated that 1,000 abortions would be committed each year under the allowances put into place in 2022; however, there were fewer than 150, according to a VA filing.

After President Trump took office in January and issued an executive order to enforce the Hyde Amendment (which prevents federal funding of certain abortions), the DOD announced it had officially ended Biden's abortion-related travel allowances.

Why It Matters:

According to Jody Duffy, RN, a former Army officer and military spouse of 35 years, the number of abortions among military women is not fully known. Many pregnant service members or spouses will visit the military medical facility to verify they are pregnant, she explained, but they don't return. Instead, they may go to a local abortion facility or wait until they are on leave to have an abortion near home, making it impossible to know how many abortions actually occur among military women.

It is known that there is a great deal of pressure for women in the military to have abortions and get back to being ""good soldiers."" In fact, when asked by the press in 2023 why ""abortion [is] critical to military readiness,"" then-White House National Security Council spokesperson John Kirby said, “Our policies… whether it’s about female service members — one in five — or female family members being able to count on the kinds of health care and reproductive care specifically that they need to serve, that is a foundational sacred obligation of military leaders.”

In other words, it is erroneously believed that women need to have abortions to fulfill their commitment to the U.S. military.

The rate of unplanned pregnancy in the military is actually higher than the rate of unplanned pregnancy among civilians. According to the pro-abortion group Ibis Reproductive Health, there are about 72 unplanned pregnancies per 1,000 women of reproductive age in the military vs. 45 unplanned pregnancies per 1,000 civilian women.

And like the 64% of women who have had abortions say they felt pressured into it, women in the military are under immense pressure to abort. Bethany Soros became pregnant while stationed in Iraq, and her boyfriend broke up with her when she told him. She didn't want to have an abortion, but also knew she'd have no support.

“One of the stigmas attached to a female getting pregnant on a deployment is the assumption that she did it on purpose,” Saros wrote in an essay for Salon. “It’s whispered about any time the word ‘pregnancy’ comes up right before or during a combat tour. The unspoken code is that a good soldier will have an abortion, continue the mission, and get some sympathy because she chose duty over motherhood. But for the woman who chooses motherhood over duty, well, she must have been trying to get out of deployment.”

Duffy explained that an abortion doesn't fix anything for men or women in the military:

The pain and grief of abortion only adds more stress and conflict to their lives. Whether it is the female soldier not wanting to sacrifice her military career or feeling pressured to fulfill her duty, or the male soldier feeling fatherhood may stand in the way of his mission, sacrificing our unborn children to abortion is an unfortunate and frequent reality of military life. Abortion decisions often involve varying degrees of pressure and conflict. This predisposes them to have more intense post abortion reactions and even trauma.

The Bottom Line:

No federal funding should be used to pay for any abortions or abortion expenses. Allowing it to fund the abortions of specific children is discriminatory.

When women are already facing pressure to abort, the government's offer to pay for the abortion is not a source of relief, but further pressure that helps push a woman into an abortion she doesn't want.",https://www.datocms-assets.com/131250/1764434330-gettyimages-165675850.jpg?auto=format&fit=max&w=1200,N,0.0,2025-12-01 18:57:10.191843

PEARLAND, Texas, Dec. 1, 2025 / PRZen / Star Sleep & Wellness, a leading provider of comprehensive sleep disorder care, is proud to announce its expansion into Pearland, Texas at 2501 S Galveston Ave. This marks a significant milestone in the organization's mission to deliver compassionate, personalized, and effective sleep therapy to communities across the state.

With over 30 years of experience and more than 23,000 patients helped, Star Sleep & Wellness is now bringing its renowned ""Star Experience"" to Pearland. The new location offers a full spectrum of diagnostic and treatment services for sleep disorders, specializing in oral appliance therapy, along with CPAP therapy, and health and wellness coaching — all under one roof.

""Our expansion into Pearland is more than just growth — it's about deepening our commitment to the people of Texas,"" said Dr. Kent Smith, CEO of Star Sleep & Wellness. ""We're here to save lives, heal relationships, and extended careers for all patients across our great state. We are not just restoring energy through better sleep; we are rejuvenating life for those who have been struggling for years to get good sleep they deserve.""

A Silent Epidemic: The Urgency of Treating Sleep Apnea

Sleep apnea is a serious medical condition that affects nearly 80.6 million adults in the U.S., yet 80% of cases remain undiagnosed. Untreated sleep apnea can lead to devastating health consequences, including cardiovascular disease, stroke, diabetes, and depression. Despite its prevalence, many people dismiss sleep apnea as a minor issue — a misconception Star Sleep & Wellness is determined to change.

""People come to us for many reasons — snoring, daytime sleepiness, relationship struggles, or simply not being able to sleep next to their partner,"" said Dr. Joyce Shotwell, Sleep Physician and Medical Director for Star Sleep & Wellness ""But what they often don't realize is that these issues can lead to other more serious problems.""

Community Outreach and Accessibility

Star Sleep & Wellness is committed to making care accessible and affordable. The Pearland location accepts Medicare, Tricare, and most major insurance providers. Star Sleep & Wellness is proud to offer a ""Star Plan"". This program allows qualified patients that may be facing financial hardship to get the treatment they deserve without the strain of high costs that some medical care can bring.

""We believe cost should never be a barrier to better health,"" said Dr. Zachary Sherman, Sleep Physician with Star Sleep & Wellness ""Our goal is to make sure every person in the Pearland area who needs help with sleep can get it. The Star Plan opens the pathway to this much needed medical care that otherwise would have been closed due to financial constraint.""

Personalized Care That Puts Patients First

The Star Sleep & Wellness team includes board-certified sleep physicians, dentists, nurse practitioners, and physician assistants who collaborate to create customized treatment plans for each patient. They spend the time personally connecting with each patient and address what matters most to them. Whether the issue is mild snoring or complex sleep apnea, Star Sleep & Wellness provides solutions that are comfortable, effective, and tailored to each individual's needs.

After a difficult childhood, she enlisted in the U.S. Air Force in 2005 — helping planes take off but never leaving her lifelong dream behind. A unique program from the Uniformed Services University would take her there.

A turbulent upbringing, a new start

In her youth, she lived with extended family, friends, “moving around from home to home, going to school, working, getting straight A’s, but on my own. It was just wherever I could get support,” she said.

As her mother struggled with mental health challenges, Slimski went to “the hospital with her and watched how supportive the medical people were … every step of the way. Seeing the length that people were going to, to help somebody in need really stuck with me.”

Through that experience, she started developing her passion to help people. “I just wanted to bring it forward and help in other ways. Going to medical school was always my dream.”

She tried college, but “I had no one to look to for any guidance on how to do anything … nobody in my family had ever gone to college. I dropped out after a year and thought, ‘OK, I'll join the Air Force because that kind of seems like a good option for me to jump start.’”

Enlisting in the U.S. Air Force “opened up a lot of doors to me that I don't think I would have known about or even how to pursue,” she said.

She trained as an air traffic controller, a demanding role. “It was a great career. I really enjoyed it because it was fast paced,” she said. “You have to be able to think quickly, process information, and change plans. I always had one thought: ‘Maybe one day I could use this to figure out how to become a doctor.’”

While serving at Nellis Air Force Base, Nevada, and Joint Base Pearl Harbor-Hickam, Hawaii, Slimski took college classes and got a degree in aeronautics. She also took prerequisite medical school coursework but working night shifts and rotating schedules made completing it impossible. Then she read an article about a new program at the Uniformed Services University of the Health Sciences called the Enlisted to Medical Degree Preparatory Program, known as EMDP2.

The highly competitive program is a two-year academic journey towards medical school, designed to help promising, motivated enlisted personnel from across the military services become future military doctors. EMDP2 offers an intensive pre-medical program, mentoring, and Medical College Admission Test preparation. The program also allows service members to maintain their current rank, pay and benefits while going to school full-time at George Mason University’s Prince William County Campus in Virginia.

“As soon as I saw it, I thought it sounded like the perfect program for me because it would solve these issues. I could finish this,” she said.

She applied and was accepted. While eight months pregnant Slimski began school as the first and only woman in the program’s inaugural 2014 class of 10 students.

“It was all men that first year, except for me,” she said. “It just felt like a normal military experience, because a lot of times you end up being the only female.”

Two weeks into the program, she gave birth to her daughter, Kailani. “I ended up taking a week off with the newborn and then played catch-up basically for that week because it is such a rigorous schedule,” Slimski said. Her mother-in-law stepped in to help while her husband, Donald, an air traffic controller himself, was stationed several hours away and then on a remote assignment, so she was able to complete pre-medicine classes with her cohort.

The EMDP2 provided “a much stronger bond” than other preparatory programs, she felt, and “everybody feels like they're connected, and they want other people to succeed and are just very supportive and making sure they can succeed. Honestly, it was pretty incredible.”

She also went to Maxwell Air Force Base, Alabama for commissioned officer training. “I learned about the leadership role, but I'm not really big at leading drills because I really don't have that loud, projecting voice. But I got more leadership focus, so that was more interesting and fun.”

Slimski was accepted into medical school at USU while pregnant with her second daughter, Ellayah, and caring for Kailani and her two stepchildren. While juggling family life and relocating, she credited the program with setting her up for success. “The program was a really good, solid foundation for medical school. They walked us through all of the application steps, so you can check the boxes. It was foolproof.”

Family medicine with purpose

When it came time to select her specialty, Slimski chose family medicine. “Family medicine is really great in that it’s kind of a little bit of everything,” she said.

Slimski, a mother of two and a stepmom, is now a Military Health System family medicine physician with the 1st Special Operations Medical Group - Hurlburt Field, Florida. She cares for active duty service members while supporting high operational demands.

“It’s really rewarding because there is a really high-ops tempo here and … they really do push the mission and readiness,” she said. “I really do enjoy it a lot. It’s challenging.”

Slimski said her enlisted background and an “ingrained” sense to complete the mission has shaped her success in the medical field.

“We have an extra military bearing and realization that what we do has an effect on people and we know how to carry forward. Basically, we know what we’re supposed to do when we’re supposed to do it,” she said. “I think (service members) have more of a deeper understanding of the fact that what they do has an impact in the long run.”

Yet it’s more than just fulfilling mission requirements for Slimski — it’s about resilience in the face of adversity.

“There are a lot of things that can happen throughout our lives, and you can’t really let things hold you back,” she said. “You just have to keep that mindset, no matter what happens and think, ‘I’m going to push myself to move forward. The opportunities are there. You have to go for it.”",https://d1ldvf68ux039x.cloudfront.net/thumbs/photos/2512/9416134/1000w_q95.jpg,N,0.0,2025-12-01 18:57:23.230589

The Breastfeeding Shop and Ms. Gatter will collectively pay the United States $1 million to resolve the allegations.

TRICARE, managed by the Defense Health Agency, is the health care program for U.S. military service members, retirees and their families worldwide. In 2015, the TRICARE program rolled out a new benefit of breast pumps and related equipment for nursing mothers.

The United States alleged that during the early years of the new benefit, The Breastfeeding Shop billed the TRICARE program hundreds of dollars more per breast pump than it charged to the Pennsylvania Medicaid Program, thereby utilizing a prohibited dual fee schedule. The United States also alleged that The Breastfeeding Shop engaged in prohibited “unbundling,” meaning The Breastfeeding Shop would take breast pump accessories that are pre-packaged and included in the standard breast pump kit and then bill TRICARE separately for each item as a replacement part.

“Durable medical equipment suppliers play a vital role in providing safe and effective medical products to patients in need, and especially to our brave service members and their families,” said U.S. Attorney Metcalf. “As alleged, The Breastfeeding Shop and Gatter prioritized their own financial interests through a billing scheme that was to the detriment of the government. This conduct will not be tolerated by my office.”

“Today’s settlement is a direct result of the relationship we have with our partners at the Department of Defense Office of Inspector General’s Audit component and the Department of Justice,” stated Christopher M. Silvestro, Acting Special Agent in Charge of the Defense Criminal Investigative Service Northeast Field Office, the law enforcement arm of the Department of Defense’s (DoD) Office of Inspector General. He further stated, “Fraud involving TRICARE, the healthcare system for military members and their families, is something we take seriously and will investigate fully.”

“Protecting the integrity of the TRICARE program and ensuring responsible stewardship of taxpayer dollars are top priorities for the Defense Health Agency. This settlement sends a clear message that we will not tolerate practices that exploit the program and inflate costs at the expense of our service members, veterans, and their families. Access to essential medical equipment, like breast pumps, is vital for the health and well-being of new mothers and infants within our TRICARE community. We thank the U.S. Attorney’s Office and the Defense Criminal Investigative Service for their continuing dedication to the pursuit of justice,” stated Dr. Glen Diehl, Acting Deputy Director of the Defense Health Agency.

Walter's Way

Walter’s Way: Proactive Booking to Improve Specialty Care

By Roan Smith, WRNMMC Hospital Communications

Walter Reed National Military Medical Center is making it easier for patients to schedule specialty care appointments with a new system called proactive booking. This new method is a more efficient and simplified process designed to get patients seen faster.

Launched in September 2025 with Walter Reed’s Orthopedics Department and expanded to include Oncology as of Nov. 1, proactive booking is part of the Walter’s Way initiative to improve access to care and medical readiness.

With this new approach, patients no longer need to call the Integrated Referral Management and Appointment Center (IRMAC) to schedule specialty appointments. Instead, trained bookers review accepted referrals and reach out directly to patients to schedule appointments, including virtual visits when available.

“The goal is to make sure every appointment slot is filled, and that patients get the care they need as quickly as possible,” said Cindy Cruzan, a Walter Reed nurse.

This new process helps Walter Reed ensure that active-duty service members receive timely specialty care while continuing to support retirees and family members.

“This process lets us manage appointments more efficiently,” Cruzan added. “And improves access for everyone.”

More departments are expected to adopt proactive booking in the months ahead as Walter Reed continues to expand efforts that simplify access and enhance patient experience.

The Defense Health Agency supports our Nation by improving health and building readiness—making extraordinary experiences ordinary and exceptional outcomes routine.","Defense Health Agency-Public Health has launched its first-ever Medical Radiation Safety Officer course to ensure a consistent standard of safety for patients and staff across its global network.

The course, which brings together service members and civilians for 40 hours of specialized training, was developed to address a critical gap in standardized training for radiation safety officers, or RSOs, who are responsible for overseeing the safe use of radioactive materials and X-ray-producing devices in military hospitals and clinics.

""A lot of times, a radiation safety officer is appointed by the commander or director as a collateral duty,” said Army Lt. Col. Jodi Santiago, chief of the health physics division at the Defense Centers for Public Health-Aberdeen. “This course provides the training so they can optimally execute their responsibilities.”

While civilian radiation safety courses exist, course developers emphasized that this program is uniquely tailored to the specific needs of DHA.

""We’ve really geared it towards what our military treatment facilities need,"" said Santiago. “The training addresses DHA policies and the military chain of command, aspects not covered in civilian programs.”

Brian Livingston, the DCPH-A Radiation Safety Officer and health physicist who spearheaded the curriculum's development, says the goal is to create a common set of skills and a professional network for RSOs spread across the world.

""Radiation-related incidents may occur at DHA facilities and we need trained (individuals/staff) to respond to these situations,” said Livingston. “We are working to learn from historic incidences to develop best practices to address issues and avoid future occurrences.""

For students, the course offered crucial insights, especially for those transitioning from other radiation safety fields. Navy Lt. Jeffrey Divis, a radiation health officer with an extensive background in industrial and naval nuclear programs, attended to bridge knowledge gaps for his new role in a medical center.

""I've been an RSO before, not on the medical side,"" said Divis. ""This course addresses my medical radiation safety program needs.” Other attendees found the course helped them refine their current practices.

""It's given me some things to go back and look at now that I've been doing the job for a year,"" said Jason Fewkes from Madigan Army Medical Center, located at Joint Base Lewis-McChord in Washington. “It really helps me refocus where I should be and take a look at how I can make things better.”

The comprehensive curriculum, which includes hands-on training with various radiation detection instruments, was highly praised by participants.

Army 1st Lt. Adrien Giuliano, a nuclear medical science officer at the Eisenhower Army Medical Center located at U.S. Army Fort Gordon, Georgia, was so impressed that he thinks the course should be mandatory for all new military health physicists.

""Everything we've gone over so far is really in-depth,"" said Giuliano. “I shared in one of my class evaluations that this course would benefit any new military health physicist.”

The course's instructors are a mix of experienced civilian certified health physicists and military nuclear medical science officers, who bring real-world experience from inspecting and managing military hospitals and clinics. They all have a simple, but vital, goal.

“My ultimate goal is that the course helps ensure the health and safety of patients and workers,"" said Jerry Falo, a DCPH-A health physicist. “I want to give the students some knowledge and information they can take back to their facilities and use in running their programs. I also hope to learn something from them so I can do an even better job supporting them here.”

The course organizers are gathering feedback to refine the program, with plans to offer it in the future and potentially take it on the road to other facilities, Santiago said.

Female breast cancer accounted for the highest cancer incidence rate for the ten leading cancers among active-duty members of the military between 2018 and 2022. Innovative research funded by the BCRP contributes to high-impact advances in clinical practice and treatment used within the Military Health System. Continued breast cancer research gives hope to current and future members of the military, and helps Warfighters stay mission-ready while knowing their Families receive the best care available.

According to data provided by the Defense Medical Surveillance System of the Defense Health Agency, on average, the Military Health System provided care for 67,739 women and 507 men for invasive breast cancer annually between 2015 and 2024, including an average of 420 active-duty military members each year. For females 40-59 years of age, the incidence rate of breast cancer is https://doi.org/10.1002/cncr.34978 in Service Members compared to the general population.

Environmental Exposures and Breast Cancer Risk Among Military Women

Throughout their service, members of the military may experience environmental exposures to substances that can increase the risk of developing cancer. The Department of Veterans Affairs recognizes female breast cancer as a presumptive cancer related to burn pit exposure.

In fiscal year 2019, the BCRP funded a Breakthrough Award – Funding Level 2 – Population Science and Prevention Studies – Partnering Principal Investigator Option, led by Celia Byrne, Ph.D., at the Uniformed Services University of the Health Sciences, and Mary Beth Terry, Ph.D., at Columbia University, to investigate the association between environmental exposures and breast cancer risk for women serving in the military.

“For our project, CDMRP funding has been critical in supporting research into the reasons why young, active-duty military women are experiencing an increase in early onset breast cancer,” Byrne and Terry said. “CDMRP’s emphasis on the need for innovative and novel approaches to studying breast cancer risk allowed us to design a study to evaluate the impact of environmental determinants of breast cancer and the potential for impact of exposures that, while common in the civilian population, may be more prevalent with military service.”

Byrne and Terry’s study builds on existing resources within the Department of Defense. The team identifies cases of breast cancer diagnoses in active-duty women using the DOD’s Cancer Registry, a registry documenting tumors and cancers across the Military Health System. Then, the researchers obtain pre-diagnostic serum samples from the same individuals through the DOD’s Serum Repository, which stores blood samples collected from active-duty military members. To date, the researchers identified over 850 breast cancer cases from the cancer repository.

By combining biospecimens and other data, including genetic information and blood-based biomarkers of environmental exposures, the researchers aim to answer longstanding questions regarding potential associations between environmental exposures and risk of breast cancer in specific populations.

“Rather than only looking at genetic factors alone, we must consider how women at higher genetic risk of developing breast cancer might be more susceptible to the influences of these environmental exposures,” Byrne and Terry said.

Triple-Negative Breast Cancer Vaccine Advances to Clinical Trials

Triple-negative breast cancer, an aggressive subtype associated with fast-growing tumors that often spread to other parts of the body, accounts for approximately https://acsjournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.3322/caac.21863 of all breast cancers. This subtype represents a larger proportion of breast cancers among younger women, including the age range for active-duty military service, compared to other age groups. Triple-negative breast cancer lacks estrogen receptors, progesterone receptors and large amounts of HER2/neu protein commonly used as targets for the treatment of other breast cancer subtypes, limiting treatment options.

In fiscal year 2016, the BCRP funded a Breakthrough Award – Funding Level 3 – Clinical Trial – Partnering Principal Investigator Option, led by the late Vincent Tuohy, Ph.D., George Budd, M.D., and Thaddeus Stappenbeck, M.D., Ph.D., at the Cleveland Clinic, to conduct a phase 1 clinical trial testing a vaccine for triple-negative breast cancer. The vaccine generates an immune response to alpha-lactalbumin, a milk protein expressed in the breast during late pregnancy and lactation. Most triple-negative breast cancers express high levels of alpha-lactalbumin, making this protein a potential target for treatment or prevention.

The investigators aim to determine the best dose and safety of the vaccine in females recently diagnosed with triple-negative breast cancer who recovered from current standard of care therapy. The researchers also test the vaccine in healthy subjects who elected prophylactic mastectomy because of their familial risk for breast cancer.

“CDMRP's BCRP has been a vital source of funding for studies of novel approaches to breast cancer treatment and prevention,” Budd said. “Thanks to the CDMRP, we have been able to perform a first-in-human trial of a vaccine designed to prevent or treat breast cancer.”

With an early phase clinical trial underway, the research team’s work will inform the next set of clinical trials, demonstrating potential to move new treatments and preventative approaches to patients.

Improving Care in the Military Health System

Since the program’s inception in 1992, BCRP-funded research contributed to the development of digital mammography and digital breast tomosynthesis, also known as 3D mammogram, now adopted as the standard of care for breast imaging and breast cancer detection across all health care sectors, including those where Service Members and their Families seek care.

According to data provided by the DHA Pharmacy Operations Division, Military Health Service providers filled more than 132,900 prescriptions between 2007 and 2024 for FDA-approved drugs developed in part by BCRP-funded research: abemaciclib, palbociclib, ribociclib and trastuzumab.

In 2023, the DHA expanded a genetic testing pilot program for Service Members and their Families to include the Breast Cancer Index®. Research funded by the BCRP contributed to the development of this prognostic test that evaluates the likelihood of recurrence and benefit from extended anti-estrogen therapy.

Kara Kenan, a disabled U.S. Air Force Veteran due to breast cancer diagnosis, received the Breast Cancer Index test after experiencing side effects from anti-estrogen therapy during the first five years after breast cancer treatment.

“I finally had the Breast Cancer Index test, which indicated I wasn't really getting any additional benefit from continuing on hormonal treatments. I was able to come off of [the treatment], and my body was really grateful because that treatment was really difficult.” Kenan said.

Kenan served as a fiscal year 2024 BCRP peer reviewer, sharing her experiences to help ensure funded research addresses the concerns and need of patients, including Service Members and Veterans.

“I think we are in a renaissance of what is happening with cancer treatments and diagnostics,” Kenan said. “There's so much going on right now, and it is all so very exciting.”",https://cdn.dvidshub.net/images/dvids_logo.svg,N,0.0,2025-12-01 07:56:40.212528

Thousands of providers were not paid on time throughout the country, said Eileen Huck with the National Military Families Association.
""But I think what we may see is that providers are limiting the number of Tricare patients that they'll accept, or just deciding that they won't accept new Tricare patients.""
For 2026, most Tricare health plan costs for military families and retirees will go up between 2% and 3% next year.
The charges are in line with what Tricare patients have seen over the last several years, Huck said.","For the first half of 2025, mental health providers in Hampton Roads complained that the military health insurance Tricare was not paying providers on time.

Ramsey Goshert with Mission Harbor Counseling in Virginia Beach was one of several mental health counseling services in the area who did not get paid on time for several months by the contractors hired by the Defense Health Agency to run Tricare. Payments are now arriving on time, but the billing issues put a strain on providers and patients, he said.

The larger issue is because of Tricare's ""completely insulting reimbursement rates, many providers are no longer participating,"" Goshert said. ""This is making it increasingly difficult for Tricare beneficiaries to find a provider, especially therapy.""

Changes in Tricare administration at the start of the year contributed to the issues. A new contractor, TriWest Healthcare Alliance, was put in place to run the western part of the country.

Humana Military, which administers Tricare in the eastern part of the country, changed the subcontractor which handles their claims. Thousands of providers were not paid on time throughout the country, said Eileen Huck with the National Military Families Association.

Mental health providers, some of which didn't see payments for several months, were hit particularly hard, she said.

""A small mental health provider or speech therapist or physical therapist, somebody who's seeing a patient multiple times over the course of a few weeks or months,"" she said. ""If they're not getting reimbursed, that's really something that they just can't sustain.""

NMFA is one of the groups that pushed Congress to place language in the new defense bill that will require DHA to report on what caused the 2025 Tricare delays.

""I don't know where the breakdown occurred, but I think that it's on DHA to make sure that they are exercising very close oversight during what is a very complicated process,"" she said.

Many of the payment delays were resolved by the second half of the year, but not before causing massive disruption for the 9.4 million troops, military families and retirees around the country which use Tricare, she said.

""When I ask if they are seeing providers leave the network, they have consistently said that they are not seeing that,"" Huck said. ""But I think what we may see is that providers are limiting the number of Tricare patients that they'll accept, or just deciding that they won't accept new Tricare patients.""

And cost increases are coming for families as well. For 2026, most Tricare health plan costs for military families and retirees will go up between 2% and 3% next year. The price of prescription drugs will increase more than 15%. The charges are in line with what Tricare patients have seen over the last several years, Huck said.

""Certainly anytime there's a cost increase, especially when the cost of living is already so high, and we know a lot of families are struggling financially, the last thing we want to see is, you know, struggling to afford health care.""
