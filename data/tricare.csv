Deydre Teyhen relinquished directorship of the Defense Health Network–National Capital Region on April 14, leaving behind a health system that is a benchmark for integration, innovation, and operational readiness within the Military Health System.
• Accreditation: Six successful Joint Commission surveys—including both Walter Reed National Military Medical Center and A.T. Augusta Military Medical Center—were completed without major findings.
• CMS Recognition: A.T. Augusta Military Medical Center earned 5-star status from CMS, placing it in the top 8% of hospitals nationwide.
Under Teyhen’s leadership: • Burnout dropped 4% in less than 1 year, supported by frontline leadership training for more than 450 personnel and the launch of My Military Health huddle programs.
As Teyhen departs to serve as Director of Defense Health Network Indo-Pacific and Commanding General of Medical Readiness Command, Pacific, her blueprint for leadership remains.","After nearly two years of visionary leadership, U.S. Army Brig. Gen. Deydre Teyhen relinquished directorship of the Defense Health Network–National Capital Region on April 14, leaving behind a health system that is a benchmark for integration, innovation, and operational readiness within the Military Health System.

While the outcomes speak for themselves—higher patient satisfaction, increased virtual care, streamlined access, and a stronger, more connected workforce—Teyhen attributes it all to one essential ingredient: ‘how’.

“We often focus on the 5W’s: who, what, when, where, and why—but in the NCR, we focused on the ‘how,’” said Teyhen during her final remarks. “How we lead, how we build trust, and how we treat our people and patients. How is critical in leading the joy and soul back to medicine. Governance gave us the foundation to transform this network into an integrated healthcare system that focused on making it better for our patients and our staff.”

Teyhen championed a robust governance model that ensured every facility, specialty, and stakeholder had a seat at the table. Leaders from hospitals and clinics in the network were voting members on the Board of Directors, four systemwide committees, and 14 functional councils. The result was a culture of shared decision-making that accelerated alignment and eliminated roadblocks to execution.

This approach focused on bringing the joy and soul back to medicine enabled:

• 98% of capability and capacity changes to be implemented through formal governance pathways.

• Elimination of stand-alone decision-making, ensuring consistent follow-through across all sites.

• 2600+ missions processed, distributed, and closed—a testament to the network’s operational efficiency.

“Our governance process wasn’t a checkbox,” said Teyhen. “It was a strategy. It’s what enabled execution, collaboration, and ownership at every level.”

Dr. David Smith, Acting Director of the Defense Health Agency, underscored the far-reaching impact of this model.

“Brig. Gen. Teyhen embodies what effective, decisive leadership looks like,” said Smith. “She built a system where facilities weren’t just part of the network; they were the engine of it. Her leadership proves that when you empower those who are delivering health care every day, results follow.”

With governance guiding every initiative, the NCR reached historic highs across multiple operational fronts:

• Enrollment and Access: 12,000 additional patients enrolled; thousands of new primary care appointments added monthly. The improvements in access to care resulted in decreased use civilian urgent care clinics.

• Virtual Health: Expanded across the DHN-NCR from 22 to 154 clinics; 495 providers offering over 3,000 virtual visits per week.

• Surgical Optimization: Operating room utilization exceeded 81%, reaching the highest case volumes since 2022.

• Accreditation: Six successful Joint Commission surveys—including both Walter Reed National Military Medical Center and A.T. Augusta Military Medical Center—were completed without major findings.

• CMS Recognition: A.T. Augusta Military Medical Center earned 5-star status from CMS, placing it in the top 8% of hospitals nationwide.

• Graduate Medical Education: 98% first-time board pass rate across 51 programs.

Using governance to align specialties and streamline care delivery, DHN-NCR improved both internal operations and patient outcomes:

• Horizontal integration initiatives such as “mammograms while you wait,” over-the-counter prenatal vitamin access, and remote pharmacy activation removed barriers to care and improved health outcomes.

• Vertical integration across product lines like orthopedics and pulmonary ensured patients moved more seamlessly between their primary care and specialty care providers.

• A standardized bed report improved real-time patient flow, while credentialing and privileging processes were harmonized, reducing time to complete the privileging process by 34%.

Governance also played a role in transforming the region’s culture. Under Teyhen’s leadership:

• Burnout dropped 4% in less than 1 year, supported by frontline leadership training for more than 450 personnel and the launch of My Military Health huddle programs.

• Well-being was 39% higher among staff engaged in effective daily team huddles.

• Engagement survey participation rose to 67%, far exceeding the industry standard.

In communications, all 34 MTFs focused on improving our patients’ ability to navigate the healthcare system. A redesigned patient guidebook served as the foundation for beneficiary education, while outreach campaigns for MHS GENESIS and My Military Health helped staff and patients transition confidently to new digital platforms.

As Teyhen departs to serve as Director of Defense Health Network Indo-Pacific and Commanding General of Medical Readiness Command, Pacific, her blueprint for leadership remains.

“I’ve had many incredible roles, but the NCR was special,” Teyhen said. “Because here, I got to lead a team that believed the ‘how’ matters—that excellence, trust, and compassion aren’t just values, but ways of doing the work. We worked hard to bring the joy and soul back to medicine. And we did it together.”",https://cdn.dvidshub.net/images/dvids_logo.svg,N,1.0,2025-04-14 16:56:20.175644

Ferrara said his priorities for the Military Health System are increasing the lethality of the warfighter, sustaining the skills of the medical force and ensuring accessible, high-quality and sustainable care.
""We do this by having a ready medical force so we can provide strong battlefield care and keep guns in the fight.""

""Readiness cannot be secondary,"" he said. ""You cannot do readiness at the last minute. You cannot cram for readiness. When it comes to mission success, readiness is everything.""

Ferrara, appointed in January 2025, has delivered that message at speaking engagements, visits to military hospitals and clinics, town hall forums and interviews.

""We are the only U.S. health care system that goes to war,"" said Ferrara, who deployed four times when he served as an active-duty Navy surgeon.

""When America's sons and daughters go downrange and go into harm's way, we honor the pact we made with them and with their parents, that should they become ill or injured, they will receive prompt and effective medical attention anywhere in the world,"" he said. ""That is the trust that we have. That's something that our adversaries don't always have, and it gives us an incredible strategic edge.""

Ferrara said his priorities for the Military Health System are increasing the lethality of the warfighter, sustaining the skills of the medical force and ensuring accessible, high-quality and sustainable care.

""We have to support the warfighter, sustain our skills and strengthen our chain,"" he said, adding that the chain is the continued evolution and modernization of the health care system to improve access, quality and safety.

""If we support, sustain and strengthen, that is how we build a system that will fight and win because fundamentally, this is what our job is: to fight and win,"" Ferrara said. ""We do this by having a ready medical force so we can provide strong battlefield care and keep guns in the fight.""

Referring to readiness as both a medical and moral imperative, Ferrara noted that part of his role is conveying to Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth how the MHS is aligned with his priority of force lethality. He said the MHS optimizes warfighter performance by sustaining the readiness of the military force and those charged with their care and recovery.

This year, the Defense Health Program budget is approximately $61 billion, about 7% of the Pentagon's topline budget. Ferrara said he uses that budget to make the force more lethal and more ""fit to fight and win.""

""It starts with maintaining the ready medical force,"" he explained. ""We must ensure that every member of the team — from the surgeon who wields a scalpel, to the logistician who procured the scalpel; from the nurse who transfuses the blood, to the team who runs the blood bank — is at the top of their game.

“And that’s where it causes that really characteristic, painful rash.” What are the first signs of shingles?
How does the shingles vaccine work?
And the shingles vaccine could help prevent dementia.
If you’ve recently had shingles, Felley said most doctors will wait for a year before giving you the vaccine.","About one in three people in the United States will get shingles during their lifetime, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

It’s not deadly, but there is a painful rash that lingers for two to four weeks. The most common complication is postherpetic neuralgia, which is long-term nerve pain that lasts for months to years after the rash clears.

Dr. Laura Felley is an infectious disease physician at Emplify Health in La Crosse. She treats the most serious cases of shingles where the virus has traveled to the central nervous system, causing meningitis or encephalitis.

WPR’s “The Larry Meiller Show” recently talked about shingles with Felley. Here are the biggest takeaways from the discussion.

What is shingles, and what causes it?

The Varicella zoster virus causes shingles, Felley said. It’s a herpes virus — the same one behind chickenpox and meningitis.

After you’ve had chicken pox, the virus takes root in your nerves. There, it can stay dormant for decades until a change or stress to your immune system awakens the virus.

“When the virus wakes back up, it travels down along the nerve root to the skin,” Felley said. “And that’s where it causes that really characteristic, painful rash.”

What are the first signs of shingles?

There are a few warning signs of shingles before the rash appears on the skin. You might experience prodromal pain, Felley said. That’s pain or tingling under the skin where the rash will eventually develop, typically in stripes on one side of the body.

Additionally, the CDC website says you might also run a fever.

Felley said it’s important to get to the doctor as soon as you notice the beginning of the painful rash. Taking prescribed oral antivirals within 72 hours of the rash’s appearance might clear the rash quicker and reduce the amount of pain you experience.

“Being vigilant and not being shy about talking to your doctor, [that] things just aren’t feeling right is really the way to go,” Felley said.

How does the shingles vaccine work?

Essentially, the shingles vaccine bolsters your immune system’s response to the virus. The CDC says the Shingrix formulation is 90 percent effective at preventing shingles and postherpetic neuralgia in adults ages 50 and older with healthy immune systems.

Felley recommended getting the vaccine after age 50 because you lose your immunity to the initial chicken pox infection you suffered as a child. If you have a weakened immune system, you might get the vaccine earlier than 50.

The vaccine is a series of two shots, Felley said. Get the second dose within two to six months of receiving the first. You only need to get it once — it’s not needed annually like the flu shot.

The shot might cause irritation or swelling at the injection site. Felley said up to 10 percent of people experience systemic reactions like muscle pain, fatigue or a headache.

“I view it as just a very small investment of your time overall to prevent some real misery later on,” Felley said.

And the shingles vaccine could help prevent dementia. A study out of Wales shows that people who received an older formulation of the vaccine were 20 percent less likely to develop dementia over time than those who were unvaccinated.

If you’ve recently had shingles, Felley said most doctors will wait for a year before giving you the vaccine.

What about taking care of the rash?

Keep the rash clean, covered and don’t let anyone touch it, Felley said. The open sores provide a way for the virus to spread to others.

The rash will crust over in seven to 10 days.

“It can take a little while for the scabs to fall off after that,” Felley said. “Do not pick at them. Just leave them be. They will fall off on their own, even if they’re itchy.”",https://www.wpr.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/town-center-pharmacist-angelina-cox-prepares-a-dose-9b14d7.jpg,N,0.0,2025-04-14 15:56:36.028502

Maj. Michael Dills presented Anandzi, Choi, Fantone, and Terrell with the Sergeant Major’s and Commander's Coins for their accomplishments.
“It didn't seem to me like any of the Soldiers who didn’t earn the badge had any reservations about going again.","FORT DETRICK, Md. – Four Soldiers from the U.S. Army Medical Research Institute of Chemical Defense and U.S. Army Medical Research Institute of Chemical Defense earned the prestigious Expert Field Medical Badge following a grueling five-day competition earlier this month at Fort Walker, Virginia that tested their combat skills as well as their ability to deliver cutting-edge life-saving medical care in a variety of austere scenarios – vital skills for ensuring our forces remain resilient, adaptable, and lethal.

Brig. Gen. Lance Raney, commanding general of Medical Readiness Command-East, pinned the EFMB on Capt. Seung Choi and Capt. James Terrell of USAMRICD and Staff Sgt. David Anandzi and Capt. Kayla Fantone of USAMRIID at a ceremony following the competition on April 2. Fantone had the additional distinction of getting perfect scores on all her tests – popularly referred to as earning the EFMB with “No Blood.”

A total of seven Defense Health Agency Research and Development-Medical Research and Development Command teammates from USAMRIID, USAMRICD, and the Walter Reed Army Institute of Research competed in the event, which consists of an expert physical fitness assessment, a written test, a 12-mile ruck march, exercises for evaluating evacuation and warrior skills and day and night land navigation exercises. The Army's Medical Center of Excellence, which developed the EFMB tests, describes their purpose as measuring ""a Soldier's physical fitness and ability to perform to standards of excellent in a broad spectrum of critical medical, evacuation and warrior skills.""

The EFMB is notoriously hard to earn; the overall pass rate is typically less than 30%. Earning the badge is a demonstration of the recipients’ achievement of a high standard of readiness.

“EFMB testing is designed to be stressful,” says Choi, a research biochemist who earned the EFMB on his first attempt. “It’s often just you and a stone-faced grader while you navigate and perform the tasks in front of you. It could be warm and sunny outside, but the air is cold and stiff, the testing area is completely silent, and you find yourself second-guessing your approach, your knowledge, and your instincts. There’s almost no room for error, and any little mistake could potentially be your last.”

The competitors singled out the cadre for praise for their support throughout the training and competition weeks. The sharing of knowledge and expertise among peers is an important technique for improving Warfighter resilience, adaptability, and lethality.

“The instructors really wanted all of us to succeed,” says Terrell, a research biochemist for whom this was his second attempt to earn the badge. “They spent lots of extra time with us in study halls, and if anybody had any questions, they were out there with us. They were also at the testing site 24/7. It's not like they went to a hotel or back to their house every night. They were going through it with us, which was really cool.”

Fantone, a microbiologist who earned the EFMB on her first attempt, says that having a good attitude, being open to learning and putting in a lot of effort are crucial for improving the odds of success – characteristics that are vital for meeting the Army’s high standards of readiness for both individuals as well as at the unit level.

“The EFMB will humble you and find your weaknesses,” says Fantone. “But that's what I like about it. It was fun because you actually learn your weaknesses as well as your strengths out there, and discover what you need to work on.”

A common theme among EFMB competitors is how the experience energizes them to tackle the next career challenge and continue honing and improving their Warfighter and medical skill sets, such as pursuing Air Assault, Airborne, or Ranger badges.

“You get such a drive to do it while you're there, you have to forget about everything else,” says Anandzi, the NCO In Charge of USAMRIID’s Pathology Division. “There is so much to remember in such a short period of time that once you start to realize that you can actually do this, then it's like oxygen. You just want to go back and just keep it. You practice so much that you can’t get it out of your head afterward!”

Following the award ceremony, MRDC’s Command Sgt. Maj. Michael Dills presented Anandzi, Choi, Fantone, and Terrell with the Sergeant Major’s and Commander's Coins for their accomplishments.

“I think everybody who went through the competition had a rewarding experience,” says Terrell. “It didn't seem to me like any of the Soldiers who didn’t earn the badge had any reservations about going again.

What are common upper extremity injuries?
Military injury data indicate that among the upper extremities, the shoulder is the most commonly injured body area.
Shoulder injuries can be more severe and require a longer recovery period than lower extremity injuries.
Over two-thirds (69%) of military injuries are cumulative microtraumatic injuries that result from overuse.","Service members experience 25 million limited duty days annually due to injuries, most of which are musculoskeletal injuries, also known as MSKI.

When on limited duty status, a service member may not be able to maintain required training activities and may not be deployable. As a result, the combat readiness of the U.S. military forces is substantially reduced by MSKI, costing the Department of Defense billions of dollars annually.

“For decades, the data have consistently shown that MSKI are the primary reason for service members’ medical visits,” says Dr. Bruce Jones, a retired Army physician and current senior advisor to the Defense Health Agency-Public Health Clinical Public Health and Epidemiology Directorate in Aberdeen, Maryland. “Though MSKI most commonly occur in lower body areas such as the knees, legs, ankles and feet, approximately 20% of all military medically reported injuries are to upper extremity areas, such as to shoulders, elbows, wrists, hands and fingers.”

Upper extremity injuries require unique recovery treatments that are most effective when tailored to an individual’s injury, as well as their specific work and personal activities. This treatment is provided by military Occupational Therapists Practitioners, known as OTPs, who are trained to treat service members’ upper extremity injuries from shoulders to fingertips.

“The treatment of an upper extremity injury depends on many factors: how long ago the injury occurred, the overall health of the service member, and compliance with the treatment plan,” says U.S. Army Maj. Amanda Hetzler, an OTP currently assigned to DHA-Public Health in Aberdeen.

She points to evidence that early access to OT is the leading factor in reducing a patient’s recovery time.

“The sooner we can start working with an injured service member, the better outcomes can be,” says Hetzler.

What are common upper extremity injuries?

Military injury data indicate that among the upper extremities, the shoulder is the most commonly injured body area.

Some units may be at higher risk of these injuries. For example, an analysis of medical data found that compared to other service members, military paratroopers have been treated for more acute shoulder injuries, such as fractures, sprains or dislocations of the shoulder or acromioclavicular joint (where the shoulder and collarbone meet). The data also showed paratroopers were more likely to develop shoulder overuse injuries than non-paratroopers. Shoulder injuries can be more severe and require a longer recovery period than lower extremity injuries.

While Hetzler says she also often sees acute, or single incident, pain injuries to the wrist or hand caused by a fall on outstretched hands while a service member is running and carrying gear, most injuries she has seen in the military population are the result of overuse.

Overuse injuries occur from a repeated, low-intensity force over time that damages tendon, joint, ligament, muscle and/or skeletal tissue, overwhelming the tissue’s normal ability to recover. Over two-thirds (69%) of military injuries are cumulative microtraumatic injuries that result from overuse.

Hetzler describes other upper extremity overuse injuries commonly treated by OTs:

Thumb and wrist pain, including de Quervain's Tenosynovitis and Gamer’s thumb: Also sometimes called de Quervain's tendinosis or de Quervain's tendinitis, this condition occurs when thumb tendons become inflamed and cause pain and swelling at the base of thumb into the side of the wrist or lower arm. Symptoms can include numbness and/or a sensation that your thumb is sticking when you try to move it.

Elbow and forearm pain, especially Lateral Epicondylitis: Also referred to as elbow tendonitis or sometimes tennis elbow, this condition causes pain in the affected forearm when you’re trying to complete ordinary movements such as gripping or holding even relatively light objects, turning knobs, driving, typing, or shaking hands.

What causes upper body injuries?

“Overuse injuries can be attributed to various activities that require repetitive motion such as pushing, pulling, and lifting and can also be impacted by ergonomics, tool use, and the overall strength and condition of a person,” says U.S. Navy Lt. Cmdr. Emmy Hartley, an OTP currently assigned to Naval Hospital Pensacola, Florida.

Some upper body diagnoses such as ‘Gamer’s thumb’ are commonly given due to the many cases in the U.S. that are caused by excessive use of video game remote control devices and cell phones. The term ‘tennis elbow’ is frequently used because of the popularity of racquet sports that contribute to repetitive strain on the wrist, causing the condition. Although the condition ‘tennis elbow’ may be diagnosed for service members, it is rarely caused by tennis play within the military population.

“More relevant to the military, evidence has shown that certain occupations that require intense repetitive physical activity, such as shooting rifles, performing mechanic work, or carrying objects during military tasks, can increase the risk of certain upper body injuries,” says Hartley.

In addition to unique mission activities such as paratrooper duties, Hetzler recalls patients describing some examples of triggering military activities:

Pushups

Weightlifting (especially ‘snatching,’ which involves taking a wide grip on a weighted barbell, pulling it off the floor rapidly, and lifting the barbell over the head with arms outstretched in one continuous motion, placing stress on the wrist.)

Lifting of gear (loading and unloading)

“While these activities are often critical to military training or duties, the patient can often not perform them while injured,” says Hetzler. “In addition, a key part of most OT treatment plans will require a recovery period where these activities should not be performed.”

What can you do to minimize the impact of an upper extremity injury?

“The best way to reduce the impact of an injury is to prevent it from occurring. Most injuries, especially overuse injuries, are preventable,” says Jones. “Various military resources are available to help service members target key injury risk factors and improve service member readiness by reducing injury risk.”

These resources can help service members avoid injuries while maximizing fitness, and allow early accessibility to an OTP. For example, some Army units are including Holistic Health and Fitness, known as H2F, teams into their brigade formations, while Navy and Marine units have the Navy Operational Fitness and Fueling System, or NOFFS.

“If you develop a MSKI or experience painful symptoms not yet limiting you, seek immediate care,” says Hetzler. “With delayed care or a lack of proper intervention, injuries can result in reduced readiness of the unit, limited military career progression or worse—permanent disability.”

Hetzler and Hartley also highlight that OTPs can provide activity analysis of specific tasks, such as lifting, pushups, and body mechanics, while the task is being performed. These analyses result in preventive education and training that can further reduce the risk of MSKI.

“The most important step is early diagnosis and referral to an OT who will help develop and monitor your treatment plan. Especially, don’t ignore pain in joints,” says Hetzler. “Once you are under the care of an OT, of course, you need to follow the treatment plan. This is the best way to reduce your chance of a longer recovery or permanent condition.”

A memo from Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth on reducing the department’s spending on contracts stresses using the department’s own employees instead—so-called “contracting in.”

The memo lists several contracts recently terminated including ones with the Defense Health Agency for consulting services “that can be performed by our civilian workforce”; one with the Air Force for cloud IT procurement “which we can already fulfill directly with existing procurement resources”; and a DARPA contract for IT helpdesk services “that are duplicative with service capabilities of our existing DISA workforce.”

“These contracts represent non-essential spending on third party consultants to perform services more efficiently performed by the highly skilled members of our DoD workforce using existing resources,” it says.

Federal unions long have advocated for agencies to examine whether work performed by contractors could be done more efficiently and at less cost by federal employees—the opposite of “contracting-out” in which agencies study in-house costs for comparison against private sector bidders.

Hegseth’s memo follows by days one in which DoD set policies on consolidating and eliminating offices and civilian jobs under a directive telling components to conduct a review of their organizational structures and workforces.

Among numerous other provisions, that guidance says that “all functions that are not inherently governmental ( e.g., retail sales and recreation) should be prioritized for privatization.”

Want to learn more about our Stafford Lakes Village or any of our Retirement Living Communities?","The Holt Bolt program at TriCare Stafford Lakes is bridging generations, giving young people of all abilities real-world work experience while enriching the community.

At TriCare’s Stafford Lakes Retirement Community, something wonderful is happening. Every Thursday morning, a group of bright, enthusiastic young people arrive, ready to roll up their sleeves and get to work. But these aren’t just any workers – they’re part of The Holt Bolt School Leavers Employment Support Program, a life-changing initiative that helps young people with disabilities gain real-world work experience. And let’s just say, the TriCare residents have taken them in as their own.

It all started with a simple conversation. Andrea Lambie, the Village Manager at Stafford Lakes, recalls the day Toni Sutherland walked into her office. Toni, a mentor with The Holt Bolt, was looking for local area opportunities for a group of school leavers to gain work experience.

“She explained how the program works and we spoke about the kinds of tasks they could help with, and soon enough, we had three young people joining us every week.”

Now, the program has grown to four participants, and the impact has been enormous – not just for The Holt Bolt trainees, but for the entire Stafford Lakes Retirement Community.

What is The Holt Bolt School Leaver Employment Support Program Program?

Originally starting as a personal training facility, The Holt Bolt has evolved into something much bigger. Offering exercise physiology sports programs and personal training, the NDIS-approved service is also dedicated to helping young people with disabilities transition from school into the workforce. Over two years, participants develop essential life and employment skills in real-world settings, setting them up for greater independence and future job opportunities.

Their mission is to identify the talents of the people they work with and create pathways and opportunities for them to share their talents and passions with their community.

Each week, Holt Bolt trainees are placed in various workplaces, including cafés, opportunity/ thrifts shops, and businesses like TriCare, where they get hands-on experience in different roles. For many, this is the first step toward long-term employment, and as Andrea points out, “They just bring so much joy and energy to the place.”

Meet The Holt Bolters

At Stafford Lakes, The Holt Bolt participants take on a range of jobs – and it turns out they’ve got some serious skills.

Take Hannah, for example. “She’ll try anything,” Andrea says. “She’s been cleaning the fountain, planting flowers, working in the salon – she’s just so happy to give everything a go.”

Then there’s Cooper, who quickly revealed a knack for attention to detail. “On his very first day, he was spotting all the fire exits and defibrillators. He just remembers everything,” Andrea says. “So now, I’m thinking of getting him involved in some of our safety audits because he’s an exceptional eye for detail.” He is excellent with supporting our office administration work.

There’s Tommy who helps in the café, serving coffees and chatting with the community. He is passionate about delivery excellent customer service and with his social personality has made him a hit with the residents.

Josh is the newest recruit. He’s a car and fitness enthusiast and really has enjoyed hand on tasks and working with tools.

The ripple effect

What makes this program truly special is the impact it has on both sides of the generational divide. For The Holt Bolt trainees, it’s a chance to build confidence, develop skills, and gain a sense of independence. But for the residents, it’s a source of joy, connection, and a reminder of the vibrancy of youth.

“Our residents absolutely love them,” Andrea says. “They stop and chat, they share stories. It’s not just about the work they do – it’s about the relationships they build. Having young people around creates such a wonderful energy in the community.”

Beyond that, the trainees are genuinely very helpful in our busy environment. “They take on real jobs,” Andrea points out. “They’re collecting bottles and cans for recycling, putting together sales brochures, delivering mail, helping in the café – they’re making a real contribution to our community at Stafford Lakes .”

Looking to the future

As the current cohort continues on their two-year program, we look forward to seeing the team grow their passions and gain skills for their future employment. Programs like this aren’t just about training – they’re about connection, belonging, and proving that everyone has something valuable to contribute. And at Stafford Lakes, that’s something they’ve embraced wholeheartedly.

When it comes to caring for ageing loved ones, families can sometimes find themselves navigating a complex array of care choices. At TriCare, we understand the emotional journey of finding the right support, whether that’s considering home care packages or exploring Residential Aged Care options.

Understanding care options

Many families initially explore home care packages as a first step. While these services can provide temporary support, they aren’t always the comprehensive solution that seniors with increasing care needs may require.

Home care: Limitations and challenges

Home care packages may be helpful in the early days of needing extra support, but they come with significant considerations that may come into play in the longer term:

1. Limited support

Home care services typically offer intermittent assistance, which may not provide the comprehensive continued support needed as care requirements intensify. Seniors might receive just a few hours of support per week, leaving significant gaps in care.

2. Mounting home modifications

As care needs increase, homes often require costly modifications, such as:

Safety railings

Stair lifts

Bathroom adaptations

Specialised equipment.

These modifications can quickly become expensive and may not ultimately solve increasing care challenges.

3. Carer fatigue

Families attempting to manage home care often experience significant emotional and physical strain. The responsibility of coordinating care, managing rosters, and supporting a loved one can be overwhelming.

When home care isn’t enough

Clear signs that Residential Aged Care might be a good option include:

Increasing complex medical needs

Safety concerns at home

Significant challenges with daily living activities

Isolation and reduced social interaction

Respite Care: A valuable transition option

For families hesitant about moving straight to permanent Residential Aged Care, Respite Care offers a valuable “try before you buy” experience. TriCare’s Respite Care services provide:

With nearly three decades of experience holding leadership positions in the military and private sectors, Dr. Marchi has developed expertise in his industry. In his current role as the technical director of healthcare sustainability and environmental health at Ecompex Inc., where he has been employed since 2024, he has been leveraging his skills to successfully meet his responsibilities. At Ecompex, Dr. Marchi leads enterprise-wide sustainability and performance improvement initiatives across military treatment facilities (MTFs), building structured, high-impact programs to meet objectives. This includes creating and implementing data-driven, quality strategies, developing training frameworks, optimizing team performance to enhance operational efficiency and patient outcomes, and standardizing best practices to promote consistency and innovation.

Dr. Marchi's additional responsibilities include developing and implementing sustainability policies throughout the Military Health System to ensure compliance with the Defense Health Agency (DHA) and collecting, analyzing and presenting sustainability data using inferential statistics for the DHA annual report. Dr. Marchi designs health promotion initiative workshops to establish sustainability teams at MTFs, driving innovative solutions that minimize environmental and social impacts while maintaining fiscal responsibility. Additionally, he leads risk assessments, strategic reports and cost-saving initiatives to enhance mission readiness and ensure regulatory compliance. By applying principles of the triple bottom line (people, planet and profit) framework, Kaizen, and Lean methodologies, Dr. Marchi consistently improves company performance while remaining within the budget.

Before accepting a position at Ecompex, Dr. Marchi was employed as a knowledge management analyst for the U.S. Army Medical Center of Excellence (MEDCoE) in 2023. From 2018 to 2021, he served as a U.S. Army Critical Care at 1Prospect Technologies. Dr. Marchi gained valuable experience during his 21-year military career and held several positions while serving in the U.S. Army, working as a flight paramedic and critical care program manager from 2016 to 2018, a combat medic training program manager from 2014 to 2016, the director of clinical practice for the Army air ambulance unit from 2006 to 2014 and health clinic manager and treatment coordinator from 1997 to 2006.

Dr. Marchi holds a Doctor of Health Sciences in leadership in clinical practice and education from The George Washington University, a Master of Science in occupational safety and health from Columbia Southern University and a Bachelor of Science in health science from Purdue University Global. An avid learner, Dr. Marchi has supplemented his university education by engaging in several continuing studies programs. The American Hospital Association awarded him designations as a Certified Professional in Healthcare Risk Management (CPHRM). He received a Certified Professional in Talent Management (CPTD), certification from the Association for Talent Development and is a Certified Professional in Healthcare Quality (CPHQ), a designation granted by the National Association for Healthcare Quality. From the Collaborative Institutional Training Initiative (CITI Program), Dr. Marchi received certifications in health information privacy and security for clinical investigators and social and behavioral research. He also completed a responsible conduct of research course through the CITI Program.

Dr. Marchi has taken several courses through the LinkedIn Corporation. These include Become an L&D Professional; Project Management: Healthcare Projects; Systems Thinking; Using Neuroscience for More Effective L&D; Construction Management: Safety & Health; Flipping the Classroom; and The Neuroscience of Learning. From the Board of Certified Safety Professionals, he received certifications as an instructional trainer and graduate safety practitioner. He holds flight paramedic certification from the International Board of Specialty Certification and licensure as a basic life support instructor from the American Heart Association. The Federal Emergency Management Agency granted him certification in National Incident Management Systems ICS-100, ICS-200, ICS-700 and ICS-800. Finally, Dr. Marchi received his paramedic license and emergency medical services (EMS) instructor certification from the Texas Department of State Health Services and is listed on the National Registry of Emergency Medical Technicians.

In addition to his professional and academic accomplishments, Dr. Marchi donates his time as a volunteer at the San Antonio Food Bank and as a court-appointed special advocate for Child Advocates of San Antonio. He maintains memberships with the National Association for Healthcare Quality, the Board of Certified Safety Professionals, the American Hospital Association and the National Association of EMS Educators. He has published articles in journals associated with EMS World and the Medical Center of Excellence.

Dr. Marchi's most notable career achievement occurred while working with a service that facilitated an international collaboration between aeromedical evacuation paramedics and nurses. The goal was to enhance the combat efficiency of the current U.S. Black Hawk helicopter platform, which is capable of accommodating six litter patients and utilizing one U.S. flight paramedic. The team established new policies to support this collaboration and clarified jurisdiction over pharmaceuticals and liabilities between U.S. and Norwegian forces. Dr. Marchi collaborated closely with the Commanders to successfully plan and implement a groundbreaking joint international initiative. This initiative entailed deploying a UH-60 aeromedical evacuation platform, staffed with one U.S. flight paramedic and one Norwegian flight nurse, to enhance support combat operations in Afghanistan. The collaboration extended to Norwegian forces, with General David H. Petraeus visiting the location to observe the efforts. The Secretary of Defense of Norway and the Chief of the Swedish Air Force also came to witness the collaboration. This was significant for Sweden because, at the time, discussions were underway regarding the purchase of either UH60 Black Hawk or NH90 helicopters.

For his accomplishments while in the U.S. Army, Dr. Marchi was awarded the Meritorious Service Medal, five Air Medals, six Army Commendation Medals and a Combat Medical Badge. These experiences sharpened his ability to lead dynamic teams, implement resilient performance strategies, and drive high-stakes decision-making.

Dr. Marchi attributes his success to his resilience and tenacity. He is firmly convinced that achieving the highest quality of patient care is not only possible but essential when healthcare professionals are empowered with the necessary knowledge, resources, and institutional support to uphold rigorous standards of practice, continuously improve their skills, and cultivate a culture of compassionate, evidence-based care. Looking toward the future, Dr. Marchi hopes to secure a role in shaping healthcare policies that will lead to enhanced community health outcomes and an improved healthcare system, particularly in the context of Veterans' Affairs. Dr. Marchi is also developing a leadership philosophy called the Learning Leader, which integrates education and leadership.

That’s because non-compliance can result in business disruption, productivity losses, fines, penalties, and settlement costs, among other factors that come with a hefty price tag. Even data breaches are more expensive if an organization is non-compliant.

In recent years, organizations across various sectors have faced significant fines for non-compliance with regulations such as HIPAA, GDPR, and CCPA.

The high cost of regulatory non-compliance

Regulatory non-compliance can result in financial penalties ranging from thousands to millions of dollars.

European regulators imposed €4.48 billion in fines across 2,086 cases, mainly targeting insufficient legal grounds for data processing and inadequate security measures. Companies lacking comprehensive data governance frameworks were hit hardest. For example, the GDPR can impose fines of up to 4% of a company’s annual global revenue for violations. This was the case for Meta, which was fined €1.2 billion in 2023 for having an insufficient legal basis for data processing. This remains the largest GDPR fine to date.

Regulatory bodies may take legal action, leading to lawsuits or criminal charges. For instance, companies that commit financial fraud under SOX may face criminal prosecution, and executives can be personally held liable.

In June 2024, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) issued more than $500,000 in SOX penalties and fines to the former chief financial officer at Synchronoss Technologies for allegedly falsifying financial statements and lying to the company’s auditor. This came after Synchronoss reached a $12.5 million settlement with the SEC for engaging in “long-running accounting improprieties” in June 2022.

Contracts and funding depend on regulatory compliance

Businesses may face restrictions, such as losing the ability to process transactions or operate in certain markets. For example, a payment processor found in violation of PCI DSS requirements may be prohibited from handling credit card transactions, impacting revenue and customer trust.

Organizations that fail to comply with government regulations may lose contracts or funding opportunities.

For example, in February 2025, the military health benefits administrator Health Net Federal Services (HNFS) agreed to pay $11.2 million to settle allegations that the company falsely certified compliance with cybersecurity requirements for three years in a contract with the U.S. Department of Defense to administer the TRICARE program. In addition to paying that fine, they also lost their TRICARE West Region contract.

Many businesses require their partners and vendors to maintain strict compliance standards, and these often go beyond regulatory requirements to include commercial frameworks like SOC 2. Enterprises that have strong security and privacy standards may refuse to work with vendors who fail to meet those standards, resulting in lost revenue and missed growth opportunities.

HIPAA penalties linked to data protection failures

According to the US Department of Health and Human Services’ (HHS) Enforcement Highlights, they have received nearly 375,000 complaints since the compliance date of the Privacy Rule in April 2003. Analysis of $144.9 million in HIPAA fines reveals that inadequate safeguards for electronic protected health information (ePHI) were the primary cause.

Multiple breaches exposing sensitive patient data, such as Montefiore Medical Center’s $4.75 million settlement, resulted in the largest penalties.

California’s increasing focus on privacy led to substantial fines for companies that failed to provide required consumer opt-out mechanisms or mishandled data access requests. This signals a trend toward stricter enforcement in the future.

In March 2025, the California Privacy Protection Agency fined Honda $632,500 for making it unnecessarily difficult for consumers to exercise their privacy rights, such as opting out of data sharing.",https://img.helpnetsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/26142115/compliance.jpg,N,0.0,2025-04-14 01:56:18.391241

A new reallocation plan seeks to reduce dependence on outside contractors and shift resources toward in-house operations.

United States Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth has cut $5.1 billion in defense contracts for consulting and nonessential services. The move targets redundant agreements, with plans to shift much of the work to in-house personnel.

The cuts include a range of consulting deals with major firms like Accenture, Booz Allen Hamilton, and Deloitte, which have been providing services to the Defense Health Agency. Hegseth noted in a video posted to X that these terminations alone will save $1.8 billion. Other notable reductions include a $500 million US Navy contract for business process consulting and a $1.4 billion cloud software reseller agreement.

Hegseth also cut a $500 million DARPA contract for IT help-desk services, calling it ""completely duplicative."" Additional terminations target contracts supporting diversity, equity, and inclusion programs, climate initiatives, and coronavirus response efforts – areas Hegseth described as peripheral to core defense operations.

In an internal Pentagon memo, Hegseth said the Defense Department's civilian workforce could take over many consulting services currently outsourced to third-party firms. For example, he identified the Air Force's contract with Accenture to resell enterprise cloud IT services as a need that existing government procurement resources could directly fulfill.

In addition to terminating contracts, Hegseth directed the Pentagon's chief information officer to work with Musk's task force over the next 30 days on a plan to insource IT consulting and management services across the department. The memo also called for negotiating more favorable rates on cloud computing.

The cancellations, initiated by Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth, are part of a larger cost-efficiency campaign aligned with the Trump administration’s broader fiscal tightening goals. Major consulting firms, including Accenture, Deloitte, and Booz Allen Hamilton, are directly impacted. The restructuring dovetails with guidance from the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), headed by Elon Musk. While the move aims to curb waste and reallocate funds to essential services, critics question its long-term implications for expertise and governance.

Inside the Pentagon’s $5.1 Billion Contract Cuts

The terminated contracts include several high-value engagements that were previously awarded to third-party consulting giants for services ranging from health IT to cloud solutions. These include:

A $1.8 billion consulting contract with the Defense Health Agency involving Accenture, Deloitte, and Booz Allen Hamilton.

A $1.4 billion Air Force contract with Accenture for enterprise cloud IT reselling services.

A $500 million Navy business process consulting agreement.

A $500 million DARPA IT helpdesk contract deemed duplicative with internal capabilities.

Secretary Hegseth emphasized that the initiative is expected to yield nearly $4 billion in savings by eliminating services that could be provided by in-house teams or existing systems.

Consulting Firms Take a Hit on Wall Street

The financial fallout from the announcement was swift. Notable stock declines included:

Accenture: Down 2% to $279.52.

Booz Allen Hamilton: Dropped 2.4% to $106.30 during early trading in New York.

While Deloitte, as a privately held firm, does not report stock prices, the implications for its federal consulting practice are significant. None of the firms have issued public responses thus far.

Trump’s Austerity Doctrine and Musk’s DOGE Restructuring

The Pentagon’s decision reflects the larger government-wide cost reduction strategy led by DOGE (Department of Government Efficiency), under the leadership of Elon Musk. The Trump administration aims to cut federal expenditure by $2 trillion over time through:

Elimination of redundant programs

Closure of agencies like USAID

Reduction of federal workforce by approximately 60,000 employees

Programs tied to diversity, climate policy, and COVID-19 have also faced steep cuts. Hegseth’s directive to the Pentagon is to leverage internal resources wherever feasible, reflecting Musk’s operational philosophy of minimal bureaucracy and maximum optimization.

Elon Musk: Cost-Cutter or Conflict of Interest?

Elon Musk has played a pivotal role in the efficiency audit, offering strategic input on defense IT restructuring. Under his leadership, DOGE has:

Drafted a 30-day roadmap to “in-source” IT consulting services.

Proposed new cloud contract frameworks with reduced pricing.

Conducted audits of DoD software licenses for usage-to-cost alignment.

Musk’s dual role—as an architect of federal cost reform and CEO of SpaceX, which holds multibillion-dollar contracts with the U.S. Space Force—has sparked debate over conflict of interest. Critics argue that his simultaneous influence in defense policy and private-sector contracts may pose ethical concerns.

Political Undertones: DEI and Climate Initiatives on the Chopping Block

Part of the canceled expenditure includes contracts linked to Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion (DEI), environmental sustainability, and public health response services. These were labeled as “non-essential” by Hegseth and deprioritized in the Pentagon’s realignment strategy.

Supporters argue that eliminating these programs aligns with defense priorities. Detractors contend the cuts reflect a political bias that could marginalize underrepresented communities and weaken preparedness in future crises.

Can the Pentagon’s In-House Team Fill the Gap?

A key risk now is whether the Pentagon’s internal workforce is equipped to take on the technical and strategic consulting tasks formerly outsourced. Areas of concern include:

Cybersecurity management

Cloud migration expertise

Enterprise software support

The move may strain Pentagon personnel or delay project timelines unless accompanied by upskilling, new hires, or public-private hybrid models.

Where Will the $4 Billion in Savings Go?

The defense budget savings will reportedly be redirected toward:

Enhanced healthcare services for active-duty military and their families

Technology upgrades in defense systems

Cyber and infrastructure resilience programs

The goal is to align defense spending with mission-critical areas while reducing administrative overhead and external dependency.

Bottomline: A Paradigm Shift in Defense Spending Strategy

The Pentagon’s $5.1 billion contract cancellation signals more than just fiscal conservatism—it represents a shift in how the U.S. military views consulting, technology services, and operational self-sufficiency. The involvement of Elon Musk as both strategist and stakeholder raises legitimate questions about governance and transparency in defense procurement.

As federal agencies recalibrate under budget constraints, the long-term success of this initiative will depend on execution: Can the Pentagon maintain efficiency and innovation without the deep expertise of its former partners? And can fiscal savings translate into measurable improvements for the armed forces?

The answers will shape the future of defense policy—and perhaps the contours of government itself.",,N,0.0,2025-04-13 11:56:36.389465

From an enrollment of more than 5 million, crude prevalence of autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease was 67.3 per 100,000 persons.

Prevalence was lowest for Native American and Alaska Native populations.

BOSTON — Autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease rates in the Military Health System are comparable to the general population, but with variability among certain groups, according to a speaker.

“It is an interesting study because the military health system is a universal health care system, so it looks at a group of patients who do not have the barriers to care that the general population in the United States does,” Rachael Silverberg, MD, of the Walter Reed National Military Medical Center in Bethesda, Maryland, told Healio.

Researchers used the Military Health System Data Repository, employing ICD-10 codes for autosomal dominant PKD diagnosis. The data were presented at the National Kidney Foundation Spring Clinical Meetings.

From an enrollment of 5,028,667 patients, 3,382 were diagnosed with autosomal dominant PKD, with a crude prevalence of 67.3 per 100,000 people. Patient eGFR was calculated from serum creatinine using the 2021 CKD-EPI equation. Median age was 47 years, 3.3% of patients were on dialysis and 8.5% had renal transplants.

Prevalence was highest in women, Black and non-Hispanic patients, according to Silverberg and colleagues. Meanwhile, Native American and Alaska Native populations had lower rates. When excluding patients on dialysis or those who underwent a transplant, 908 patients had available measurements of both eGFR and albuminuria, according to the study.

Of this group, 42% had an elevated risk for chronic kidney disease progression, indicated by an eGFR less than 60 mL/min/1.73 m² or albuminuria levels greater than 30 mg/g.

In autosomal dominant PKD, patients are often identified based on genetic testing, according to Silverberg. “Either they have a family member that tests positive, or they come to care, and they are identified with an abnormality … but there is a whole period of time when people are asymptomatic, so they are at risk for progression.”

In all, autosomal dominant PKD rates were similar to the general population, with some variability in sex, race and ethnicity. More than 40% of patients with autosomal dominant PKD are at increased risk for CKD progression. Further investigation is needed, Silverberg said.

The study “can [SC1] provide some information in terms of how we can identify these patients who are actually being treated,” Silverberg added. “It is the beginning of what I think could be the future.”

I’m TDY right now. It’s a long TDY, over 15 weeks away from home station, clear across the country. So while I’d usually use Tricare East/Humana Military for my needs, it seems everything is upside down trying to get care in Tricare West.

I was injured at the start of March. Nothing that requires going home, but something that still needs physical therapy and a specialist to examine, and since I’m here until mid-June, my PCM decided it best to get me authorizations now and get me referred to to practices here.

3-4 weeks pass. Okay. I was warned it might take longer because of potential back and forths between East and West. Finally I hit week 4, and both authorizations go through. One of them goes to a PT practice out here.

The other ends up being referred to a specialist back near home station. Okay …

I call Humana Military. They say they can’t change the location of the referral because I am out of region. Can’t explain how physical therapy managed to be referred out here despite that. Then tell me to contact my PCM and start another referral with notes that it must be assigned to my TDY location. I do that.

Two days later Humana approves it … and again refers me to a specialist near home station.

I call Humana again. This time it’s someone who says I need to change my Tricare region because, again. They can’t change the referral to where I am, and like before can’t explain how the PT referral had no issues at the same time.

I’m tired of this. This seems super unnecessary but I’m just so frustrated.

I go ahead and contact Tricare West and start the process of moving under their system hoping it will be a quick procedure and they can see my prior referral and adjust it to a location here. The rep I speak to very strongly implies it’s a quick little process. I’ll just switch back to East when the TDY is over.

It’s now two days later and no one in West can help me each time I call because, in their words, until everything transfers over from the East region, they can’t work with it. And trying to schedule with my new temporary PCM to get brand new referrals out here will take even more time to the point of being moot.

Again. No idea if anyone here will be able to give me some advice. But I’m just at my wit’s end with being unable to get the care I should have started getting nearly a month ago now.

The memo's subject line Thursday was ""Continuing Elimination of Wasteful Spending of the DoD.""

The memo, signed on Thursday, canceled Defense Health Agency contracts for consulting services from Accenture, Deloitte and Booz Allen, among other firms, as well as an Air Force contract with Accenture to resell third-party enterprise cloud IT services.

Specifically, the canceled contracts include $1.8 billion in consulting, $1.4 billion enterprise cloud IT services and a $500 million Navy contract for business process consulting.

Hegseth said the work can be performed by the Pentagon's civil workforce.

""That's with a 'B' -- $5.1 billion in DOD contracts for ancillary things like consulting and other nonessential services,"" Hegseth said in a video Thursday from his office at the Pentagon, calling the contracts non-essential spending.

Hegseth directed the DOD chief information officer, in coordination with the Department of Government Efficiency, to prepare a plan within 30 days for how the department will in-source IT consulting and management services to its civilian workforce and negotiate most favorable rates on software and cloud services.

""We need this money to spend on better health care for our warfighters and their families, instead of $500 an hour business process consultant,"" he said in a statement announcing the cuts. ""That's a lot of consulting.""

He also noted cutting a $500 million contract to the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency for IT help desk services that are ""completely duplicative"" of services that the Defense Information Systems Agency already provides.

In addition, the Pentagon is cutting 11 contracts related to diversity, equity and inclusion, climate change, the department's response to the COVID-19 pandemic and related nonessential activities across the DOD.

He also announced pausing $500 million in funding to two universities -- Northwestern University and Cornell -- that ""tolerate antisemitism and support divisive DEI programs."" This is in addition to the $70 million already cut at Columbia, Penn, Brown and Princeton in past weeks.

Hegseth attended Princeton and Harvard.

""We are committed to rooting out DEI -- root and branch -- throughout this department ... I'm going to keep looking,"" Hegseth said.

The memo said $4 million can be directed to ""re-allocate to our mission-critical priorities to Revive the Warrior Ethos, Rebuild the Military, and Reestablish Deterrence.""

On March 20, he announced $580 million would be cut in programs, contracts and grants.

""If you're keeping score at home, today's cuts bring our running total to nearly $6 billion in wasteful spending over the first six weeks of the Department of Government Efficiency effort here at the Defense Department,"" Hegseth said.

On Feb. 20, Hegseth first announced that DOGE would be working on cutting excess and refocusing the department's budget.

""We're excited to make these cuts on behalf of you, the taxpayer and the warfighters here at the department,"" he said.

On March, 29, he directed the Pentagon to reduce its civilian workforce by 5% to 8 percent over the next several months. This would total 50,000 to 60,000 jobs.

This can be done through early retirement and buyouts with full pay and benefits until Sept. 30. Also probationary workers with less than two years on the job have been let go from federal agencies.

A hiring freeze was ordered on Feb. 28 by Hegseth after President Donald Trump issued a broad civilian hiring freeze over most of the federal government on his first day in office on Jan. 20 as part of efforts to slash the size of the government.

In the DoD, there are some exceptions, including 18 classes of jobs. They include teaching positions at Department of Defense Education Activity schools and on-post day care, medical facilities, immigration enforcement, public safety, recruiting and readiness.

Make sure you pay your bills because they'll cut you from tricare and you can get back in but it's a process.

2. Use the tool to search for a ""in-network provider""

You can search urgent care everything down to dentists.

They do not unless tricare says they do.

Let me tell you an anecdote.

My wife (bless her soul) needed a Dr. I told her all the above and she assured me she was good.

Guess fucking what?

She did none of that and just asked the Dr. Because her friend went there and they wanted to be Dr. Sisters or some dumb shit.

Dr. And front desk lady told her ""of course we take tricare dear!""

6 months later we get a bill for 5k.

No shit 5k.

The Dr. Was not in network.

With out of network Dr's you lose alot of tricares bargaining power.

Zynex’s Disappointing Fourth Quarter Results

ZYXI share price depression stems from its disastrous 4Q 2024 earnings release. The Englewood, Colorado-based firm reported fourth-quarter 2024 revenue of $46.0 million, a roughly 2% year-over-year decline, falling short of Wall Street's expectations. The company also swung to a net loss of $0.02 per share, a stark contrast to the $0.04 net income per share reported in the same period last year.

The disappointing results reportedly prompted RBC Capital Markets to downgrade Zynex to Sector Perform from Outperform. According to news outlets, in a report to its clients, RBC analyst Shagun Singh cited a ""lack of visibility"" into the company's operations and commercial outlook, particularly concerning its relationship with Tricare, the military health program that represents a significant portion of Zynex's revenue.

Singh reportedly noted that Tricare, Zynex's largest customer, has temporarily suspended payments amid an ongoing review of prior claims. Singh added that the company's decision to withhold 2025 guidance and implement a 15% workforce reduction further compounded investor concerns. Singh revised RBC’s price target for Zynex shares to $5.50, down from $11.00, warning of a potential ""domino effect"" stemming from Tricare's payment suspension.

Zynex Securities Class Action

Adding to Zynex’s woes, a securities class action lawsuit has been filed in the District Court of Colorado, alleging that the company made false and misleading statements regarding its revenue recognition practices and its relationship with Tricare. The suit, captioned Tuncel v. Zynex, Inc., et al., seeks to represent investors who purchased Zynex securities between March 13, 2023, and March 11, 2025.

The complaint alleges that Zynex engaged in “oversupplying” customers with products, including electrodes, leading to inflated revenue figures. It further claims that this practice drew scrutiny from insurers, including Tricare, and that Zynex failed to disclose the potential for adverse consequences, such as removal from insurer networks and government penalties.

According to the complaint, revelations of Zynex's alleged practices surfaced with a June 4, 2024 report by medical journal STAAT detailing an ""oversupplying scheme"" involving excessive shipments of supplies and subsequent inflated billing. The report also indicated that insurers were ""kicking the company out of network.""

The truth allegedly emerged on March 11, 2025, when Zynex reported its dismal Q4 and FY 2024 financial results. The complaint highlights Zynex CEO Thomas Sandgaard’s attributing the fourth-quarter revenue shortfall to ""slower than normal payments from certain payers"" and the Tricare payment suspension.

Hagens Berman’s Investigation

Hagens Berman is investigating the alleged claims. “We are examining Zynex's financial reporting and business practices. We believe investors deserve a complete and transparent understanding of these events,” said Reed Kathrein, the Hagens Berman Partner leading the firm's probe.

Without being paid, the clinics either have to stop providing services to clients with Tricare coverage or are asking their clients to pay out of pocket.
“Upon checking with our Tricare (subject-matter experts), we’ve learned that Tricare regulations and policy governing LPCs have not changed,” the spokesperson said.
Staton sent out an urgent request for data on April 4 from its members on this issue with Tricare.
Of 19 anonymous responses shared with The Pilot, representatives of different clinics reported a total of 977 patients being impacted by this change, for an average of 51 patients per responding clinic.","Health care providers serving veterans and their families across Virginia say they are missing thousands of dollars — with some having already gone out of business or are close to it — due to Tricare insurance reimbursements being stalled for months, leaving clients without critical mental health services.

The stalled payments are apparently the result of a change to Tricare’s billing processing system that began Jan. 1. Under the new system, licensed professional counselors must meet a series of new requirements or have a medical doctor sign off on their claims in order to be reimbursed, according to reports from clinicians and email chains between clinicians and Tricare provided to The Virginian-Pilot and Daily Press.

Without being paid, the clinics either have to stop providing services to clients with Tricare coverage or are asking their clients to pay out of pocket.

This change particularly affects Virginia because it has such strict standards for its licensed counselors and it has never before required oversight from a medical doctor, according to Melinda Staton, a licensed counselor and the acting president of the Hampton Roads Counseling Association.

In trying to resolve these issues, clinics and their clients have been met with inconsistent messaging from Tricare, according to responses to a request for data on the issue by the Hampton Roads Counseling Association. In an email to The Pilot on Wednesday, a spokesperson for Tricare denied any change had taken place and did not address a follow-up question about whether payments had been stalled.

“Upon checking with our Tricare (subject-matter experts), we’ve learned that Tricare regulations and policy governing LPCs have not changed,” the spokesperson said.

Staton sent out an urgent request for data on April 4 from its members on this issue with Tricare. Of 19 anonymous responses shared with The Pilot, representatives of different clinics reported a total of 977 patients being impacted by this change, for an average of 51 patients per responding clinic.

One clinic reported as many as 261 patients being affected, while four reported less than four patients affected, including one clinic that reported that while reimbursements had been delayed for about three months, they’d had zero clients impacted because “we keep seeing them and currently, we are getting payments.”

These same respondents reported losses totaling at least $175,000 for an average of about $9,210 each. Some of the respondents did not know the exact financial impact, but one said they knew it was “tens of thousands of dollars.”

In response to the request for data, many reported failed attempts to get an explanation from Tricare with some reportedly being told Tricare was experiencing “system errors” or facing a “backlogs and policy changes.”

“In the short term, we need for those clinics that have not been paid to get paid yesterday,” Staton said. “In the long term, we need policy change in the Tricare manual stating that residents can be used, especially if they’re being supervised by a fully licensed professional counselor.”

Staton said she’s aware of at least two clinics that have closed in recent months due to unpaid reimbursements from Tricare. It’s unclear how many clients have been impacted.

Meichell Worthing, a licensed professional counselor and owner of Lighthouse Counseling and Psychotherapy in Virginia Beach, said about 25% of their clients are Tricare beneficiaries and have stopped taking on new clients covered by Tricare due to the uncertainty.

Beth Hunter, a licensed counselor with Lighthouse, said one of her long-term clients who has struggled with suicidal ideation for years left her office in tears after she described the situation with Tricare.

“When I had to inform her that we have not been paid and that she has options of getting a doctor’s referral … or she could pay out of pocket, which she can’t afford to do, she just left my office in tears saying ‘I don’t know what I’ll do,’” Hunter said. “She didn’t want to continue services for my sake because she knew I wasn’t going to get paid but also for fear that what if Tricare never pays and then she’s stuck with the bill for all these months of services?”

The next day, Hunter said the client emailed her saying, “I can’t survive without therapy.”

Staton said research shows military service members in the first year of transitioning to civilian life don’t get some form of mental health care within the first year of leaving the military they are unlikely to seek it in the future, which leads to an increase in the suicide rate.

“There’s no rocket science here, it’s going to negatively affect (veterans). … If there’s a barrier to access it can be fatal,” Staton said.

The contracts appeared to be wide-ranging cuts to consulting services for the Navy, the Air Force, the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) and the Defense Health Agency.

In a video posted on X, Hegseth said the contracts were for ""ancillary things like consulting and other non-essential services."" He said the services would be brought in-house.

In the memo, Hegseth said he was directing the Pentagon's chief information officer to work over the next 30 days with tech billionaire Elon Musk's Department of Government Efficiency to prepare a plan to cut and in-source the Defense Department's information technology consulting and management services.

Hegseth stated that the contracts represented “$5.1 billion in wasteful spending” and that the cancellations would result in “approximately $4 billion in estimated savings.” Over $1 billion has already been paid out.
The contract cuts come amid an escalating attack on consulting groups by the General Services Administration (GSA), which helps coordinate government acquisitions.
Following this press conference, we will sign a joint declaration with the Canal Minister on the security and operation of the Panama Canal.
The Secretary stated, “That’s the big win here.","The Pentagon has terminated $4 billion in IT services contracts with companies such as Deloitte, Accenture, and Booz Allen Hamilton as part of the Trump administration’s ongoing liquidation of consulting expenditures.

According to a note released Thursday by Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth, the contracts were identified as “unnecessary expenditures on third-party consultants” that could be handled more efficiently by Pentagon employees.

Hegseth stated that the contracts represented “$5.1 billion in wasteful spending” and that the cancellations would result in “approximately $4 billion in estimated savings.” Over $1 billion has already been paid out.

The Pentagon canceled contracts with Accenture, Deloitte, Booz Allen, and other firms related to the Defense Health Agency and also terminated a separate Air Force contract with Accenture.

Hegseth also ordered the termination of 11 other consulting contracts “supporting Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion (DEI), Climate, Covid-19 response, and other non-essential activities.”

Despite the cuts, US President Donald Trump and Hegseth had earlier this week pledged a $1 million budget for the defense ministry for the first time.

The contract cuts come amid an escalating attack on consulting groups by the General Services Administration (GSA), which helps coordinate government acquisitions.

Last month, ten major firms, including Deloitte, IBM, and Booz Allen, were asked to identify potential savings as part of a “consultant spending review,” but their responses were deemed “demeaning” by the administration.

As a result, the companies were given a new deadline of April 18 to identify further cuts, restructure contracts based on “outcome-based” or “shared savings” models, and offer the federal government a “credit” for revenues the GSA considers excessive during the Biden administration.

Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent stated in a podcast last month that reducing government contractors would be one of the administration’s biggest sources of savings, singling out Booz Allen, which derives almost all of its revenue from government contracts, as one of the companies embroiled in “fraud” allegations.

Booz Allen stated this week that it “welcomes the challenge to create better value” for US taxpayers and that it is “engaging in good faith in a much-needed process to help the government improve efficiency. We look forward to demonstrating our capabilities to the administration.”

The cancellations by Hegseth come as Elon Musk’s Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) increasingly targets what it sees as “outrageous spending” on consulting contracts.

Last week, DOGE lauded the termination of “Google AdWords management” and “global consulting and support services” contracts for the Pacific island nation of Palau.

On Thursday, the GSA also reached an agreement with Google to lower the cost of software and services, including artificial intelligence tools, for the federal government.

The consulting cuts also coincide with a period in which the Pentagon is reducing its civilian workforce by laying off 5% to 8% of employees it deems “not mission-critical.”

US Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth announced that the US and Panama have signed a framework agreement allowing American warships to pass through the Panama Canal with priority and free of charge.

During a press conference evaluating his visit to Panama, Hegseth stated that the two countries are cooperating on border security, combating illegal immigration, fighting drug cartels, and ensuring the security of the Panama Canal, particularly in limiting China’s influence.

Hegseth said, “The US and Panama have signed a memorandum of understanding on common security issues. Following this press conference, we will sign a joint declaration with the Canal Minister on the security and operation of the Panama Canal. This document will form the basis for the free and priority passage of American warships and support vessels through the Panama Canal.”

The Secretary of Defense emphasized that the agreement envisages increasing the number of joint exercises and re-establishing rotational and joint military presence at Fort Sherman, Rodman Naval Base, and Howard Air Force Base.

Additionally, the “Jungle Operations Training Center” at Fort Sherman, which operated from 1953-1999 and prepared soldiers to fight in tropical forests, will be reopened.

Hegseth added, “Our expanded security cooperation will also strengthen engagement in cybersecurity, information sharing, bilateral security dialogues, and the modernization of canal infrastructure.”

Last month, NBC News, citing American officials, reported that the White House had instructed the American military to prepare options regarding the Panama Canal.

Possible plans ranged from closer cooperation with the Panamanian army to the occupation of the canal.

In 1977, US President Jimmy Carter signed an agreement stipulating that control of the canal would be transferred to the Panamanian government in 2000.

The canal was controlled by the US until December 31, 1999. Trump argues that the transfer of the canal to Panama weakened Washington’s position and that Chinese companies have significantly increased their influence over the canal’s infrastructure in recent years.

In early February, he stated that he was confident about regaining control of the canal.

US Secretary of State Marco Rubio also stated that Washington finds it unfair to collect transit fees from the Panama Canal, which US military forces are obliged to defend in the event of a conflict.

In his address to Congress in March, Trump announced that his administration had begun the process of reclaiming the canal.

He stated that a major American company plans to buy two ports around the canal and some other facilities connected to the canal.

According to Trump, the Panama Canal was “built by Americans for Americans, not for others.”

US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent stated today that China’s move to impose retaliatory tariffs of 84% against the US is “unfortunate” and a “losing proposition” for Beijing.

In an interview with Fox Business, Bessent said, “I think it’s unfortunate that the Chinese don’t really want to come and negotiate, because they are the worst offenders in the international trading system.”

Bessent also claimed that allies want to discuss how to rebalance China’s trade policies in talks with US officials.

The Secretary stated, “That’s the big win here. The US is trying to rebalance toward more production. China needs to rebalance toward more consumption.”

Bessent also warned Beijing against trying to devalue its currency in response to the new tariffs.

Bessent said, “If China starts devaluing, that’s a tax on the rest of the world, and everyone has to keep raising their tariffs to offset the devaluation. So I urge them not to do that and to come to the table.”

Not ruling out the removal of Chinese stocks from US stock exchanges, Bessent said that “all options are on the table.”

In an interview with CNBC yesterday, Bessent said, “I think this escalation by China is a big mistake. We are a country with a current account deficit. What do we lose by China raising tariffs against us? We export one-fifth of what they export to us. So this is a losing hand for them.”

Saying that US President Donald Trump will be personally involved in the trade negotiations, Bessent, in response to a question on whether the European Union needs to reduce non-tariff barriers, including value-added taxes, said, “Everything is on the table.”

According to Bloomberg, Apple customers lined up to buy new iPhones, fearing the company might raise prices to offset US President Donald Trump’s tariffs.

Employees at stores across the US said they were bombarded with questions about potential price increases and witnessed customers buying phones in a panic.

Although Apple declined to comment to Bloomberg, retail stores reportedly had higher sales last weekend compared to previous years.

According to a report published by TechInsights, the new tariffs that Trump imposed on Chinese goods mean that the cost of producing an iPhone for Apple could increase from $580 to $850.

Apple will likely avoid immediately raising the price of its flagship product (which it has kept at $999 since 2017), but iPhones account for 50% of its total revenue.

One of the steps Apple could take in this situation is to lobby for exemption from tariffs.

On the other hand, considering that the White House has increased the tariff it applies to China to 104%, it does not seem very likely that an exemption will be granted through China.

Meanwhile, Apple announced that it would temporarily supply more iPhones from India, which faces a tariffs of about a quarter of that of China.

Although the technology giant will probably not completely renew its supply chains, it has been producing some of its products in Vietnam, Ireland, Thailand, and Malaysia for the last few years to reduce its dependence on China.

Despite Trump’s goal of bringing production to the US, it is not realistic to expect Apple factories to open one after the other in the US in the short term. According to Wedbush analyst Dan Ives, moving iPhone production to the US is not only impossible, but could also increase the price of the smartphone to $3,500.",https://harici.com.tr/en/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Pentagon.jpg,N,0.0,2025-04-11 23:56:18.053719

Hegseth estimated the cuts would generate nearly $4 billion in savings, despite more than $1 billion already having been spent.
Despite the aggressive cuts, President Trump and Hegseth earlier this week reaffirmed their commitment to a record-setting $1 trillion defense budget.
While the GSA declined to comment on whether the Pentagon cuts were directly tied to this initiative, the overlap in timing suggests a coordinated push.
Separately, the GSA announced a new deal with Google to lower the cost of software and AI services for the federal government.","In a sweeping move reflecting the Trump administration’s intensified scrutiny of federal consultancy spending, the Pentagon has terminated $4 billion worth of contracts with major consulting firms including Deloitte, Accenture, and Booz Allen Hamilton. The news, first reported by the Financial Times, highlights what defense officials describe as a broader effort to eliminate what they consider non-essential expenditures on third-party services.

Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth announced the cancellations in a memo issued Thursday, calling the contracts “non-essential spending on third-party consultants” and arguing that much of the work could be done more efficiently by in-house Pentagon staff. Hegseth estimated the cuts would generate nearly $4 billion in savings, despite more than $1 billion already having been spent. He also characterized the total value of the terminated contracts as representing “$5.1 billion in wasteful spending.”

The terminations affect IT and consulting contracts across multiple departments, including the Defense Health Agency and a separate Air Force engagement with Accenture. In addition to the major firms named, 11 other contracts were canceled, many of which were tied to programs supporting Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion (DEI), climate initiatives, and COVID-19 response efforts — areas the administration now deems non-essential.

Despite the aggressive cuts, President Trump and Hegseth earlier this week reaffirmed their commitment to a record-setting $1 trillion defense budget. “The budget will hit $1 trillion and nobody’s seen anything like it,” Trump said during a meeting with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu in the Oval Office on Monday.

The clampdown on consultancy contracts coincides with growing tension between the Trump administration and federal contractors. The General Services Administration (GSA), which oversees federal procurement, has demanded that top consulting firms — including Deloitte, IBM, and Booz Allen — identify significant cost reductions under a “consultant spend review.” The firms were given until April 18 to restructure deals toward “outcome-based” models and issue credits for what the GSA alleges were excessive earnings during the Biden administration.

A source familiar with the review told the Financial Times that responses from several firms were considered “insulting” by senior officials, prompting the GSA to escalate its demands. While the GSA declined to comment on whether the Pentagon cuts were directly tied to this initiative, the overlap in timing suggests a coordinated push.

Booz Allen, which derives most of its revenue from government contracts, has pushed back on the criticism. In a statement this week, the company said it “welcomes the challenge to drive better value” and is participating “in good faith in a much-needed process to assist the government in increasing efficiencies.”

The cuts are also part of a broader campaign by Elon Musk’s so-called Department of Government Efficiency, which has recently targeted a variety of consulting and digital services contracts as wasteful. Last week, the department canceled contracts for Google AdWords management and other global advisory roles, including one supporting the Pacific island nation of Palau.

Separately, the GSA announced a new deal with Google to lower the cost of software and AI services for the federal government.

As part of the cost-saving drive, the Pentagon is also moving to reduce its civilian workforce by 5 to 8 percent, focusing on employees labeled as “not mission-critical.”",https://slguardian.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Pentagon.jpg,N,0.0,2025-04-11 21:56:19.783563
