Please watch the MOAA newsletter and MOAA's advocacy news page for updates on MOAA's efforts to secure a comprehensive analysis of the T-5 transition to improve future contractor changeovers.","MOAA expressed concerns about the next-generation TRICARE managed care support contracts, known as T-5, well before the changeover took effect on Jan. 1 of this year – and we will continue to seek solutions and accountability for the many problems beneficiaries have faced.

The T-5 transition took many forms, affecting many beneficiaries. More than 1.5 million TRICARE users in six states – Arkansas, Illinois, Louisiana, Oklahoma, Texas, and Wisconsin – moved from the TRICARE East Region to the West Region, while all West Region beneficiaries changed contractors, from HealthNet Federal Services to TriWest. Humana Military retained the redefined East Region but changed claims processors.

[UPDATED MONTHLY: MOAA's TRICARE Toolkit]

Since January, MOAA has provided direct assistance to our members, other beneficiaries, and medical providers who contacted us regarding access challenges and other transition-related problems. More recently, we have escalated issues related to inaccurate reports of other health insurance (OHI) that prevent claims from processing properly, copay calculations, and claims being improperly processed as non-network.

End of Referral Waiver Extensions

The Defense Health Agency will not extend the TRICARE West Region referral approval waiver, which expired June 30.

* If a beneficiary received a primary care manager (PCM) referral waiver prior to that date, they may continue seeing their specialty care provider without a point-of-service charge through Sept. 30, at which point they will need a referral from their PCM to continue treatment.

* If a beneficiary did not receive a referral waiver, they must follow standard referral practices as of July 1. More information is available at the TriWest website.

MOAA meets regularly with the managed care support contractors – TriWest and Humana Military – as well as new leadership at the Defense Health Agency (DHA) to address the numerous problems the T-5 transition has created for beneficiaries and providers. At MOAA's urging, TRICARE issued policy waivers to facilitate access to care as the contractors worked through systemic problems and continued to build a functional network in the West Region.

What's Next

Congress provides vital oversight on the multibillion-dollar TRICARE contracts, and MOAA has taken this issue to Capitol Hill, assisting lawmakers' offices with their oversight efforts.

Thanks to legislation included in the FY 2019 National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA), the Government Accountability Office (GAO) is required to conduct an evaluation of each TRICARE contract transition. The GAO has already started its T-5 assessment, but the breadth, magnitude, and duration of T-5 problems demand a more detailed analysis than what's required by statute.

MOAA has outlined recommendations for detailed report requirements addressing beneficiary continuity of care, network adequacy, the impact of transition problems on access to care, and DHA's oversight role leading up to the transition. We are urging members of Congress to ensure these requirements are included in the FY 2026 NDAA.

Please watch the MOAA newsletter and MOAA's advocacy news page for updates on MOAA's efforts to secure a comprehensive analysis of the T-5 transition to improve future contractor changeovers.",https://insurancenewsnet.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/inn-social-default.jpg,N,-1.0,2025-07-08 20:56:27.103126

Among them, the Lifestyle Coordinator plays a vital role in promoting senior wellbeing, fostering community, and creating meaningful moments. But what does a typical day look like for a lifestyle coordinator in residential aged care?

Morning: Setting the Tone for the Day

The day begins early with a warm welcome to residents. The lifestyle coordinator checks in with the care team to understand any changes in residents’ health or preferences. This ensures that activities are tailored to meet individual needs.

After breakfast, it’s time for the first group activity—often something gentle and engaging like chair yoga, morning stretches, or a music therapy session. These activities are designed to boost mobility, mood, and mental alertness.

Midday: Connection and Creativity

As the day progresses, the focus shifts to social engagement and creative expression. Lifestyle coordinators might lead a craft workshop, facilitate a book club, or organise a gardening session in the courtyard. These activities not only stimulate the mind but also encourage residents to connect with one another.

Lunch is a social affair, and the lifestyle coordinator often joins residents to foster a sense of community and observe how everyone is feeling.

Afternoon: Tailored Experiences and One-on-One Time

In the afternoon, the coordinator may run individual sessions for residents who prefer quieter or more personalised experiences. This could include reminiscence therapy, digital storytelling, or simply a friendly chat over tea.

Special events like birthday celebrations, pet therapy visits, or cultural days are also common, adding variety and excitement to the week.

Evening: Reflection and Preparation

As the day winds down, the lifestyle coordinator updates records, reflects on the day’s successes, and begins planning for tomorrow. Feedback from residents and staff helps shape future programs, ensuring they remain relevant and engaging.

Why Lifestyle Coordinators Matter in Aged Care

Lifestyle coordinators are more than activity planners, they are advocates for joy, connection, and purpose in aged care. Their work supports emotional, physical, and cognitive health, making a profound difference in the lives of older Australians.

Whether it’s through a shared laugh, a creative project, or a moment of quiet companionship, lifestyle coordinators help transform aged care from a place of residence into a vibrant community.",https://www.tricare.com.au/app/uploads/2025/07/e336fd51-bcf7-4c05-9fba-3c6dcdd94392.jpg,N,,2025-07-09 06:57:22.244151

According to the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA), nearly 1 in 10 active-duty military service members report problematic alcohol use, and the need for specialized treatment is more critical than ever.

The visit, coordinated by Cmdr. Mary King, Guam’s previous FHP manager, provided invaluable insights and skill enhancements. It included a comprehensive program overview for the current program manager, Lt. Cmdr. Heather Nelson, alongside practical exercises such as sexual assault medical forensic exams, peer reviews of the Department of Defense Sexual Assault Forensic Examination (SAFE) Reports (DD Form 2911), and detailed case reviews. The week also featured engaging lectures, collectively offering 37 continuing education units to participants.

Guam's remote location and relatively small caseload—approximately 13 to 15 sexual assault medical forensic exams annually—present unique training challenges. Cordoni's visit directly addressed these gaps, enabling previously trained forensic healthcare examiners to renew their competency and validate their skills according to DHA credentialing standards.

With DHA inspections expanding to include sexual assault response components, this training is more critical than ever. Cordoni's expertise provided invaluable insight for ensuring both exceptional patient care and full compliance with policy requirements.

For those seeking to expand their deployment readiness and contribute to the FHP's global mission, opportunities await by joining the team. Becoming a forensic healthcare examiner requires specific qualifications: licensure as a physician, physician assistant, nurse practitioner, nurse midwife, certified registered nurse anesthetist, clinical nurse specialist, or registered nurse. In limited circumstances, specially trained independent duty corpsmen may also be eligible.

Entry-level training can be achieved through several pathways, including the Sexual Assault Medical Forensic Examiner Course at Joint Base San Antonio-Fort Sam Houston, Texas, or equivalent DHA-approved training within the Defense Department. Certification with the Commission for Forensic Nursing Certification or other recognized national body, coupled with completion of the SAMFE course, is another option. Completion of the fiscal year 2016 Navy Bureau of Medicine and Surgery Mobile Training Team and the Army’s Medical Command Headquarters SAMFE Course also fulfills the requirement.

Maintaining annual credentialing and competency is paramount. This involves completing four continuing education units focused on sexual assault and demonstrating clinical proficiency through rigorous retrospective medical record reviews, live proctoring, and the successful completion of four sexual assault medical forensic exams, either simulated or real, all under the watchful eye of a qualified supervisor.

The enhanced training and validation provided by Cordoni's visit underscores USNH Guam’s commitment to providing comprehensive and compassionate care to all service members, ensuring readiness and upholding the highest standards of medical forensic expertise in the Indo-Pacific region. This commitment includes ensuring the availability of skilled professionals capable of conducting thorough and sensitive forensic evaluations when needed.

Mercer U.S. LLC was accused of overbilling the DHA for work done by specific employees and subcontractors billed at rates higher than their educational backgrounds or experience levels should have warranted.

The settlement was announced in a report from the Interim U.S. Attorney for the District of Connecticut, released on Monday.

Ahead of developing and implementing its managed care support and pharmacy services contract, DHA needed subject matter expertise from outside of the Department of Defense to make sure beneficiaries received top notch care.

The report said that DHA competitively sought offers for Health Plan Innovative Support, or HPIS, services from vendors under the General Services Administration’s Professional Services Schedule.

Prosecutors noted that around April 2020, DHA and Mercer entered into a Blanket Purchase Agreement, or BPA, for HPIS services. DHA also awarded HPIS Task 1 to Mercer.

The BPA included labor categories identifying the education and experience qualifications and associated hourly billing rate for the individuals working under the BPA.

On a monthly basis, Mercer invoiced DHA for labor expanded under the BPA at hourly billing rates that were meant to reflect the employees’ or subcontractor employees’ designated labor categories and the education and experience associated with the categories.

However, according to the government, from May 7, 2020, to Aug. 2, 2023, Mercer billed DHA for work done by 11 employees under the BPA at labor rates for which the employees did not have the necessary education or experience.

To resolve claims that could have arisen under the Contract Disputes Act and common law theories of breach of contract, such as payment by mistake and unjust enrichment, Mercer paid the government a total of $456,796.50.

The investigation was led by the Defense Criminal Investigative Service with help from the Defense Contract Audit Agency Operations Investigative Support Division.

The company allegedly assigned new prescription numbers without necessary paperwork and pharmacist approvals, after the original prescriptions expired or ran out of refills.
The judge rejected CVS' argument that the $948.8-million award violated the U.S. Constitution's prohibition against excessive fines under the Eighth Amendment.
The company maintains that the lawsuit centered on a highly technical prescription recordkeeping issue that was allowed by law in many states.","CVS Health's Omnicare has been ordered to pay $948.8 million over invalid prescriptions. The company is a leading American supplier of health products and services, with net sales broken down into medical insurance plan management services, medical benefits management, retail distribution, and other activities.

A federal judge has ordered CVS Health's Omnicare unit to pay $948.8 million in penalties and damages following a whistleblower lawsuit alleging fraudulent billing of the U.S. government for invalid drug prescriptions. The ruling, made by U.S. District Judge Colleen McMahon in Manhattan, comes after a lengthy legal battle that began in 2015.

The lawsuit, filed by former Omnicare pharmacist Uri Bassan and joined by the federal government, accused Omnicare of improperly billing Medicare, Medicaid, and Tricare for prescriptions at long-term care facilities. The company allegedly assigned new prescription numbers without necessary paperwork and pharmacist approvals, after the original prescriptions expired or ran out of refills.

Judge McMahon imposed a $542-million penalty for filing 3,342,032 false claims between 2010 and 2018, and awarded $406.8 million in damages, representing three times the $135.6 million awarded by a jury in April 2025. The tripling of damages was required under the federal False Claims Act, which allows whistleblowers to sue on behalf of the federal government and share in recoveries.

The judge rejected CVS' argument that the $948.8-million award violated the U.S. Constitution's prohibition against excessive fines under the Eighth Amendment. McMahon found CVS jointly liable with Omnicare for $164.8 million of the penalties, after jurors found it failed to stop Omnicare from submitting 30% of the false claims after buying the company in 2015.

CVS Health has announced plans to appeal the judgment. The company maintains that the lawsuit centered on a highly technical prescription recordkeeping issue that was allowed by law in many states. ""There was no claim in this case that any patient paid for a medication they shouldn't have or that any patient was harmed,"" CVS said in a statement.

The ruling highlights the ongoing challenges faced by the healthcare industry in ensuring compliance with complex regulatory requirements. It also underscores the importance of robust internal controls and oversight mechanisms to prevent and detect fraudulent activities.

2025 marks 15 years since the National Intrepid Center of Excellence (NICoE) opened its doors and began transforming the lives of service members impacted by traumatic brain injury (TBI). Since the first patient was seen on Oct. 4, 2010, NICoE has led the Military Health System in advancing care, research and education for TBI and associated conditions.

NICoE was founded to address an emerging need for specialized care for service members suffering from TBI and psychological health concerns through delivery of comprehensive, interdisciplinary treatment. With a mission centered on the return of warfighters to active duty and the improvement of quality of life for those affected by the invisible wounds of war, NICoE also contributes to the broader military medical community through professional education, telehealth, and groundbreaking research.

“Over the past 15 years, what started as the NICoE offering an innovative interdisciplinary model of TBI care has expanded into the entire Defense Intrepid Network, which provides state-of-the-art TBI care at 13 sites to thousands of service members each year,” said U.S. Army Col. (Dr.) Shannon C Ford, NICoE director. “It’s a testament to the commitment of all of our supporters that we are able to continue treating these very complicated invisible wounds.”

To commemorate the anniversary, NICoE staff gathered for a celebratory group photo—a tribute to the team of clinicians, therapists, researchers and support personnel who have shaped the center’s success. An official anniversary event will take place on Sept. 8, 2025, welcoming a broader audience to reflect achievements, share knowledge and look toward the future of TBI care.

“I look forward to continuing to build on the excellence and compassion that are the signatures of NICoE’s services to our nation’s warriors,” said Ford. “I am particularly excited by the potential of our cutting-edge research to continue to impact the complex issues relating to TBI and brain health.”",https://cdn.dvidshub.net/images/dvids_logo.svg,N,1.0,2025-07-08 16:56:22.392777

Dear Rusty: I’m a retired Navy veteran who is going to be turning 65 years old this year. My question is concerning mandatory Medicare sign-up requirements. Why do I have to sign up for Medicare coverage at 65 when I can’t start collecting full Social Security benefits until I turn 67? My Social Security benefits will not pay for my mandatory Medicare because I can’t start collecting full Social Security benefits until I’m 67!

I currently pay for Tricare and utilize my local Veterans Administration medical facilities and referrals for my health care. With me turning 65 and having to wait until I’m 67 for my full Social Security benefits, it just seems unfair that I’ll have to pay out of pocket Medicare monthly expenses for two years! Is there any way to avoid this unfair penalty? Signed: Retired Navy Vet

Dear Retired Navy Vet:

First, I want to thank you for your military service to our country. Please know here at the AMAC Foundation we care a lot about our veterans and you may find the “For Veterans” section of our Foundation website interesting (www.amacfoundation.org).

Regarding your question, you should be aware that enrolling in Medicare is not mandatory, but there are consequences if you do not enroll when you become eligible (normally at age 65).

For one thing, if you are a retired veteran on military Tricare, you will lose your Tricare benefits if you don’t enroll in Medicare when you are eligible (Tricare requires you enroll in Medicare when eligible). And, since you are not yet collecting Social Security, you will be required to separately pay the Medicare Part B premium directly to Medicare (they will bill you when you enroll in Medicare).

Another potential consequence is that if you do not enroll in Medicare Part B when you are first eligible, you may incur a lifetime late enrollment penalty for enrolling in Part B later.

Something else to keep in mind is there are two “parts” to Medicare - Part A (which is coverage for inpatient hospitalization services) and Part B, which is coverage for outpatient health care services (doctors, medical tests, etc.). Medicare Part A is free to you, but there is a premium for Medicare Part B ($185/month for 2025). Note you will need to pay a Part B premium as long as you are enrolled in Medicare Part B (it doesn’t go away after you are collecting Social Security, but it is taken from your Social Security payment). And there is no way for you to avoid the Part B premium after enrolling, and enrolling in Part B is necessary for you to continue your military TriCare-for-life benefits. Note Medicare Part A and Part B do not include prescription drug coverage, but your Tricare coverage usually does.

It’s important to note Medicare and Social Security are two independent senior programs with different eligibility rules. As you may know, you can collect early (reduced) Social Security at age 65 (and have your Medicare Part B premium deducted from your Social Security payment). But you would be collecting Social Security early and, in addition to a reduced benefit, you would also be subject to Social Security’s annual earnings test if you are still working. The Social Security earnings test limits how much you can earn before some of your Social Security benefits are taken away (if you exceed the earning limit before your full retirement age).

So, is it unfair you must pay for Medicare Part B before you are collecting Social Security? Well, I think not, because the two programs are completely independent benefits (the Social Security Administration merely administers Medicare payments as a convenience). Remember your Medicare Part A is free, but you must pay a premium for Part B, and you must take both to retain your military TriCare-for-Life benefits. You can visit this site to see how to pay your Medicare premiums until it is later deducted from your Social Security payment: www.medicare.gov/basics/costs/pay-premiums/online-bill-pay.

Once again, thank you for your service to our country.

NEW YORK — A federal judge ordered CVS Health’s Omnicare unit to pay $948.8 million in penalties and damages, in a whistleblower lawsuit claiming it fraudulently billed the U.S. government for invalid drug prescriptions.

In a Monday evening order, U.S. District Judge Colleen McMahon in Manhattan imposed a $542-million penalty for filing 3,342,032 false claims between 2010 and 2018.

McMahon also awarded $406.8 million of damages, representing three times the $135.6 million that a jury awarded on April 29.

The tripling was required under the federal False Claims Act, which lets whistleblowers sue on behalf of the federal government and share in recoveries.

CVS plans to appeal the judgment. The Woonsocket, Rhode Island-based drugstore chain and pharmacy benefits manager bought Omnicare in 2015. Omnicare has asked McMahon to throw out the case or grant a new trial.

“This lawsuit centered on a highly technical prescription dispensing recordkeeping issue that was allowed by law in many states,” CVS said in a statement on Tuesday. “There was no claim in this case that any patient paid for a medication they shouldn’t have or that any patient was harmed.”

The lawsuit was filed in 2015 by Uri Bassan, a former Omnicare pharmacist in Albuquerque, New Mexico, and joined by the federal government in 2019.

Lawsuits Alleged Improper Billing

They said Omnicare improperly billed Medicare, Medicaid, and Tricare, which serves military personnel, for prescriptions for tens of thousands of patients in assisted-living facilities, group homes for people with special needs, and other long-term care facilities.

Omnicare allegedly assigned new prescription numbers without necessary paperwork and pharmacist approvals, after the original prescriptions expired or ran out of refills.

McMahon rejected CVS’ argument that a $948.8-million award violated the U.S. Constitution’s prohibition against excessive fines under the Eighth Amendment.

“This was a very big fraud on the government, one that lasted over almost a decade, and one that Omnicare was aware of but avoided taking steps to correct,” the judge wrote.

McMahon found CVS jointly liable with Omnicare for $164.8 million of the penalties, after jurors found it failed to stop Omnicare from submitting 30% of the false claims after buying that company. CVS itself did not submit any claims.

The case is U.S. ex rel Bassan v. Omnicare Inc, U.S. District Court, Southern District of New York, No. 15-04179.

- Monitor DOJ actions: The Gilead settlement and ongoing scrutiny of speaker programs could amplify sector-wide compliance costs.","The $949 million legal judgment against CVS Health for its subsidiary Omnicare's fraudulent prescription practices marks a seismic moment for the healthcare sector. This ruling, which could ultimately cost CVS over $400 million in penalties and treble damages, exposes systemic governance failures and compliance risks that investors must now factor into their valuation of healthcare giants. For CVS, the verdict is not just a liability on its balance sheet—it's a stark warning about the consequences of merging under regulatory scrutiny and failing to address legacy liabilities.

The Legal Judgment: A Blueprint for Corporate Accountability

In April 2025, a federal jury found Omnicare liable for dispensing medications to elderly patients in long-term care facilities without valid prescriptions, resulting in over 3 million false claims submitted to Medicare, Medicaid, and TRICARE. The damages of $135.6 million could triple under the False Claims Act (FCA), while penalties of up to $28,619 per claim could push total costs toward $949 million. Critically, the jury held CVS liable as the parent company for “causing” these violations by failing to address compliance gaps it knew about for years.

CVS's defense—that state laws permitted the practices and that it lacked direct control—was rejected. The court emphasized that as a holding company, CVS was obligated to enforce compliance under a 2016 Corporate Integrity Agreement (CIA), which required oversight of Omnicare's operations. This ruling underscores a seismic shift: parent companies can no longer shield themselves from subsidiary misconduct under federal programs.

Regulatory Gaps and Governance Failures

The case reveals two critical governance flaws at CVS:

1. Lax Oversight Post-Acquisition: CVS acquired Omnicare in 2015, but internal audits and compliance reviews from 2016–2018 identified systemic issues, including “roll-over” prescriptions (assigning new prescription numbers to expired ones). Despite these findings, CVS did not mandate corrective actions, violating its CIA obligations.

2. Strategic Ambiguity: In 2022, CVS briefly explored selling Omnicare, recognizing its non-strategic value, but reversed course in 2023. This indecision suggests a lack of clarity about Omnicare's risks versus rewards—a red flag for investors in a sector where regulatory missteps can metastasize.

The Omnicare case also highlights broader industry risks. The jury's focus on “speaker programs” and kickbacks (echoed in a parallel Gilead Sciences settlement) signals that the DOJ is targeting financial incentives influencing prescribing practices—a trend that could expose other healthcare firms to similar liabilities.

Compliance Costs: A Hidden Drag on Valuations

The judgment's financial impact is immediate, but its operational consequences loom larger. CVS faces:

- Penalties and Litigation Costs: Beyond the $949 million estimate, ongoing appeals and settlements could drain cash reserves.

- Reputational Damage: Long-term care facilities may reduce CVS's market share, and federal programs could impose stricter oversight, raising compliance costs.

- Future Liabilities: Other subsidiaries or acquisitions may harbor similar risks, creating a “liability time bomb” for investors.

For investors, this demands a reevaluation of CVS's valuation multiples. The company trades at a P/E ratio of 12.5x, slightly above peers like UnitedHealth (11.8x) and Humana (14.2x). However, its higher legal exposure and governance risks may warrant a discount to reflect downside scenarios.

Investment Implications: Scrutinize Balance Sheet Resilience

Investors must ask two questions:

1. Can CVS absorb this hit without diluting shareholder value? Its $13 billion cash balance and $5 billion in annual free cash flow may cushion the blow, but sustained legal costs could strain its dividend (currently yielding 1.8%).

2. Is management accountable? CEO Karen S. Lynch has emphasized “operational discipline,” but the Omnicare verdict suggests governance gaps persist.

Actionable advice:

- Underweight CVS until management demonstrates a clear plan to address compliance risks and legacy liabilities.

- Compare to peers: Firms like AmerisourceBergen (ABC) or Cardinal Health (CAH), which face fewer regulatory headwinds, may offer safer exposure to healthcare distribution.

- Monitor DOJ actions: The Gilead settlement and ongoing scrutiny of speaker programs could amplify sector-wide compliance costs.

Conclusion: A New Era of Accountability

The Omnicare judgment is a watershed moment for healthcare giants. It signals that regulators and juries will hold parent companies directly responsible for subsidiary misconduct—a paradigm shift with far-reaching consequences. Investors must now treat corporate governance and compliance rigor as core valuation metrics, not afterthoughts. For CVS, the path to recovery hinges on transparency, proactive risk management, and a willingness to divest businesses with unsustainable liabilities. Until then, the stock remains a cautionary tale of how governance failures can unravel even the largest healthcare empires.

Final note: This case is not isolated. Investors should pressure all healthcare firms to disclose compliance frameworks and legacy risks, lest they face similar reckoning.",,N,0.0,2025-07-08 16:56:45.887129

Dr. Nabih Alem made such an impression during his two decades of service at the U.S. Army Aeromedical Research Laboratory as the subject matter expert on whole-body vibration and repetitive jolt. Vibration and jolt are experienced almost constantly by rotary-wing aviators in flight and lead to debilitating injuries over the long term.

Two decades later, to honor the legacy Alem established, USAARL officially named Building 6905 as “Dr. Nabih M. Alem Operational Research Center” in a ceremony hosted by Maj. Gen. Paula C. Lodi, commander of the U.S. Army Medical Research & Development Command and the Defense Health Agency for Research and Development. The building has been referred to as “Alem Hall” unofficially for years.

Alem had over 40 years of experience as a research engineer and scientist, 20 of those years he spent at USAARL. Although only the last half of his career was spent at USAARL, his legacy will live on for a lifetime.

Lodi noted that naming the building was a great way to honor the past by celebrating “an individual who dedicated an entire career to make a lasting impact upon our force.”

“Dr. Alem contributed significantly to USAARL’s prominence through his research and expertise as a biomedical engineer,” Lodi continued. “He was the laboratory’s subject matter expert in the military operational biomechanics of head-supported mass and body vibration and jolt. Protecting the health and well-being of helicopter occupants was his focus.”

Alem Hall houses the USAARL human vibration research suite that includes the multi-axis ride simulator, one of Alem’s primary research platforms. Dr. Khalid Barazanji, who now leads vibration and jolt research projects, remembers his early career with Alem as a mentor. “Dr. Alem was passionate about the mission,” Barazanji recalls. “He was a perfectionist who had a great heart for everyone. I used to spend days discussing the best analytic method with him.”

Dr. Barclay Butler, Deputy Commissioner for Operations and Chief Operating Officer in the Office of Operations, U.S. Food and Drug Administration, was a graduate student with Alem at the University of Michigan. Butler and Alem also worked together at USAARL for almost a decade. “Dr. Alem was the consummate scientist, researcher, engineer and mentor,” said Butler. “He is responsible for saving the lives and preventing injuries of countless numbers of servicemembers through the work he has done.”

A large portion of Alem Hall is also dedicated to USAARL's airworthiness certification and enroute care research programs, which ensure the safety and efficacy of medical equipment used in MEDEVAC.

Alem was born in Beirut, Lebanon, and immigrated to the United States in his early twenties. He earned his doctoral degree in mechanical engineering from the University of Michigan in 1974. Alem then worked at the Highway Safety Research Institute at the University of Michigan, where he authored multiple seminal publications on biomechanics of human injury and tolerance, occupant crash protection, and dynamic impact testing.

Alem began working at the USAARL in 1986. For the next 20 years, he conducted critical and novel research, investigating head-supported mass, body armor, ballistic protection, mine blast evaluation, helicopter restraints and airbags, injury assessments in crashes, and human response to whole-body vibration and repeated shocks in Army vehicles. As a master programmer, he developed computational algorithms integrated into Army-wide software tools for assessing health hazards, survivability and injury.

Alem passed away in 2006, leaving behind a legacy as a renowned subject matter expert on the biomechanical and physiological effects of mechanical shock on humans. He authored over sixty research publications that are still referenced today.

“Dr. Alem was a lifelong theoretical and applied engineer, a collaborator, a researcher, an educator, and a mentor,” said Dr. Carol Chancey, director of the Injury and Biomechanics Protection Group at USAARL.

Chancey said current researchers recall that working with Alem challenged them to think about complex engineering and research questions and that he made them better at their jobs. “I think many of us can say that…” Chancey continued, “…today, Dr. Alem’s contribution and legacy to USAARL, MRDC and the world cannot be overstated, and it will be recognized, reverenced and applied for decades to come as servicemember injuries are prevented and lives are saved.”

Spravato is the most trusted treatment nowadays because of exceptionally fast results and the fewest side effects.

This blog will help you clear the fog and break down your coverage options. This ultimate guide will walk you through everything you need to know about TRICARE. Steps to approval and how Neuroglow helps you every step of the way.

What is TRICARE?

TRICARE is a health insurance programme for the U.S. Department of Defence. It provides medical, mental health, and pharmacy benefits to active duty service members up to the age of 64 years. These members include National Guard and Reserve members, military retirees, and their families.

It offers coverage all over the world by combining a network of civilian providers with military clinics and hospitals. It offers a variety of plans, each tailored to meet distinct eligibility categories and requirements under the Defence Health Agency’s (DHA) jurisdiction.

Under stringent medical standards, TRICARE guarantees comprehensive care for specialised treatments like Spravato.

Does TRICARE cover Spravato?

Yes, TRICARE covers Spravato, but with some conditions. It covers mental health inpatient and outpatient care. Patients with treatment-resistant depression (TRD) or major depressive disorder (MDD) are treated with it.

While it does cover Spravato for eligible patients, they must meet specific medical criteria to achieve this coverage. It is also necessary that they go through a prior authorisation process.

These coverage approvals are dependent on documentation of prior treatment failures, psychiatric evaluations, and the use of Spravato in a certified facility, like Neuroglow. Coverage is available under the following TRICARE plans:

TRICARE Plan Spravato Coverage Referral Needed Prior Authorization Cost-Sharing Eligibility TRICARE Prime Yes. Covered if the criteria are met Yes Required Low copay with an in-network provider Active duty members, families, and some retirees TRICARE Select Yes.

TRICARE requirements for Spravato coverage approval

TRICARE has special requirements and coverage plans for the Spravato coverage approval. Coverage is not an automatic process. The patient must demonstrate medical necessity through well-documented clinical records.

Understanding and preparing the necessary documentation in advance is key to avoiding delays and ensuring a smoother approval process.

The details of these requirements are given as follows:

Requirement Details Diagnosis Confirmation Documented diagnosis of treatment-resistant depression (TRD) or MDD with suicidal ideation. Failed Treatment History Proof of a failed response to at least two oral antidepressants from different drug classes. Current Antidepressant Use The need for the name, dosage, and start date of the oral antidepressant to be used alongside Spravato. Age Verification Patient must be 18 or older; confirm via ID or medical record. REMS Certification Confirmation that both the provider and facility are registered in the Spravato REMS programme. Prescribing Provider Info It must include the provider’s name, credentials, NPI, and clinic contact information. Treatment Plan Overview The outline of the proposed dosing schedule (e.g., induction and maintenance phases). Monitoring Commitment Attestation that the patient will be monitored for 2 hours post-dose as required by REMS. Letter of Medical Necessity It is optional but recommended. If coverage is complex or denied, it must include the clinical rationale.

What does TRICARE cover for Spravato?

TRICARE gives full-fledged coverage for the Spravato treatment. These benefits help people to get the Spravato therapy without any financial burdens.

However, the beneficiaries may still be responsible for certain out-of-pocket expenses like copays or cost-shares based on their specific TRICARE plan. Factors like the deductible status and whether the provider is in-network affects the final costs. These coverage benefits are mentioned as:

Step-by-step guide for Spravato treatment with TRICARE

Spravato treatment under TRICARE is not a lengthy procedure, but without guidance, it can be complicated. Certified clinics across the country can assist you in navigating coverage and treatment approval efficiently.

Below is a simple step-by-step breakdown to help you understand what to expect.

Contact a REMS-certified clinic for an insurance benefits check

Schedule a psychiatric evaluation to assess eligibility for Spravato.

Have the clinic submit prior authorization to TRICARE with the required documentation

Receive approval and coordinate your treatment start date.

Begin Spravato sessions under supervision, with 2-hour post-dose monitoring at the clinic

Spravato costs with the TRICARE insurance.

TRICARE is known to typically follow the CMS billing guidelines for Spravato administration. The whole cost includes the medication, observation, and provider services. Most beneficiaries only pay copays or cost shares. These advantages vary by plan and whether your clinic is in-network.

In order to reduce out-of-pocket expenses, TRICARE also establishes payment rates that correspond with Medicare’s permitted charges. Some support programmes offer eligible commercially insured patients the medication at approximately $10 per treatment.

But these benefits are not available to TRICARE (a federal plan) enrollees.

Spravato costs without TRICARE insurance.

The cost of Spravato treatment without TRICARE or any insurance coverage can be substantial. The cost can vary based on the phase of treatment and dosage schedule. These figures are averages and may vary based on clinic location, provider fees, and other facility-specific factors.

Treatment Phase Frequency Estimated Monthly Cost Induction (Month 1) 2 treatments per week $5,600 – $8,100 Month 2 1 treatment per week $2,800 – $4,200 Maintenance (Ongoing) Weekly or biweekly $1,400 – $4,200

Some — but not all — TRICARE plans cover Wegovy for weight management.
But as Wegovy, insurance plans typically only cover it for weight loss.
How to get approved for Wegovy If your TRICARE healthcare plan does not initially cover Wegovy, you still have a few options for getting approved.
If TRICARE will not cover Wegovy for you, consider enrolling in a clinical trial for Wegovy.","Approximately 4 in 10 U.S. adults have obesity. Treatment typically involves lifestyle changes, but there are also drug treatments like Wegovy (semaglutide), an injectable GLP-1 medication that is FDA-approved for chronic weight management due to its effectiveness in lowering blood sugar and decreasing appetite.

Like most brand-name prescription drugs, Wegovy isn’t cheap. Many patients wonder if health insurance will help offset their out-of-pocket costs. There’s no definitive answer because insurance coverage depends on your specific health plan. Here’s what you should know about Wegovy coverage if you have a policy from TRICARE, the U.S. Department of Defense’s healthcare program for active duty and retiree service members, some National Guard and Reserve members, and their eligible family members.

Does TRICARE cover Wegovy?

Some — but not all — TRICARE plans cover Wegovy for weight management. According to the TRICARE website, coverage depends on whether your reason for taking Wegovy meets certain criteria and if you have a prescription from a licensed medical provider. TRICARE coverage of Wegovy typically requires prior authorization unless you are also taking other medications for diabetes management.

Reason for taking Wegovy

With the same active ingredient as Ozempic – semaglutide – Wegovy effectively lowers blood sugar. But as Wegovy, insurance plans typically only cover it for weight loss. This brand-name form of semaglutide is not approved for treating diabetes.

However, semaglutide injections, such as Ozempic, are FDA-approved for blood sugar control in Type 2 diabetes. TRICARE is much more likely to cover Ozempic for a person with obesity and Type 2 diabetes, though coverage still depends on the plan.

Getting a prescription from a licensed provider

TRICARE coverage for Wegovy also requires a prescription from a licensed healthcare provider.

Michelle Lin, DO, a board-certified doctor of osteopathy at My Family Doc in Las Vegas, Nevada, describes her approach to prescribing obesity drugs: “If the patient is overweight to any degree with failure of diet and exercise, or has the inability to exercise plus metabolic disease, inflammatory musculoskeletal flares, and pain related to carrying more weight, I would consider prescribing Wegovy.”

Prior authorization

Finally, TRICARE requires your healthcare provider to complete a prior authorization form for Wegovy. Prior authorization is a process intended to determine a drug’s medical necessity. In the form, your provider must provide reasoning for why Wegovy is necessary. If TRICARE approves the prior authorization, your Wegovy will be covered. If not, you may need to pay for Wegovy out of pocket.

According to the Military Officers Association of America (MOAA), the 2024 TRICARE prior authorization requirements stated that adult patients must meet the following criteria:

Have a body mass index (BMI) of >30 or a BMI of at least 27 with weight-related risk factors such as high blood pressure or sleep apnea

Have attempted lifestyle changes, including a reduced-calorie diet, for at least 6 months and still failed to achieve the desired weight loss

Have tried (or are contraindicated to try) another prescription weight loss drug. (Requiring patients to try a lower-cost drug before an expensive brand-name medication is known as step therapy.)

Be committed to lifestyle changes, including a reduced-calorie diet, while on Wegovy

Bottom line: Some TRICARE plans cover Wegovy for eligible enrollees, but there are strict criteria for getting insurance coverage for this particular drug.

How to get approved for Wegovy

If your TRICARE healthcare plan does not initially cover Wegovy, you still have a few options for getting approved.

Send an appeal letter to TRICARE. You can talk to your healthcare provider about ways to state that the drug is medically necessary. Novo Nordisk offers a sample letter that some healthcare providers use as a template. Even if your provider offers to write an appeal letter, you might need to submit the letter to TRICARE yourself.

Enroll in a clinical trial. If TRICARE will not cover Wegovy for you, consider enrolling in a clinical trial for Wegovy. If you qualify for a plan currently enrolling trial participants, you can get Wegovy for free or at a steeply discounted price.

Switch to a different weight loss drug. Saxenda and Zepbound are two Wegovy alternatives that might be covered by insurance. Other GLP-1s like Ozempic and Mounjaro are sometimes prescribed off-label to insurance, though off-label prescriptions are unlikely to be covered by insurance.

How much does Wegovy cost?

Wegovy is a costly weight loss medication. The average retail cost is $1,844 per four injection pen, which is a one-month supply. For people with insurance coverage, the out-of-pocket copay for Wegovy varies by plan. According to MOAA, TRICARE beneficiaries paid about $38 for a 90-day Wegovy supply via home delivery in 2024.

How to check whether your TRICARE plan covers Wegovy

You can check your insurance coverage with this web tool from Novo Nordisk, Wegovy’s manufacturer. You can also use the TRICARE formulary search tool to view the TRICARE formulary (list of covered drugs).

That said, the best way to get a definitive answer about drug coverage is to contact your TRICARE representative. In most cases, you can call the number on the back of your insurance card or prescription card.

HARTFORD, CT — A financial consulting firm with a prominent Hartford office has paid back hundreds of thousands of dollars in connection with overbilling allegations against the military.

David X. Sullivan, U.S. attorney for Connecticut, said Monday that Mercer LLC, a consulting company with an office in Hartford, entered into a civil settlement agreement.

Sullivan said Mercury paid more than $450,000 to resolve allegations it overbilled the Defense Health Agency for work performed by certain employees and subcontractors.

According to Sullivane, clients were billed at rates higher than their educational backgrounds or experience levels permitted.

The Defense Health Agency manages TRICARE’s health benefits program for service members and their families.

Before developing and implementing DHA’s managed care support and pharmacy services contracts, DHA sought subject matter expertise from outside the Department of Defense to ensure that beneficiaries receive high-quality care, Sullivan said.

Specifically, DHA competitively sought offers for Health Plan Innovative Support services from vendors.

In approximately April 2020, DHA and Mercer entered into a ""blanket purchase agreement"" for HPIS services.

DHA also awarded a contract to Mercer.

Under this task order, Mercer would provide qualified personnel with subject matter expertise relevant to the design of TRICARE programs.

This included labor categories that identified the education and experience qualifications, as well as the associated hourly billing rate, for personnel working under the contract.

Each month, Mercer invoiced DHA for labor expended under the BPA at hourly billing rates commensurate with the employees’ (or subcontractor employees’) designated labor categories and the education and experience associated with those labor categories, according to Sullivan.

The government contends that, from May 7, 2020, through Aug. 2, 2023, Mercer billed DHA for the efforts of 11 employees working under the contract at labor rates for which those employees did not have the requisite educational background or experience levels.

Mercer investigated and disclosed to the government these incorrect contract billings.",https://patch.com/img/cdn20/shutterstock/25990360/20250708/070525/styles/patch_image/public/shutterstock-268850816-1___08070425179.jpg,N,0.0,2025-07-08 09:56:40.506773

Court records show that the Defense Health Agency manages TRICARE’s health benefits program for servicemembers and their families.
DHA also reportedly awarded HPIS Task 1 to Mercer, court records show.
“Under this task order, Mercer would provide qualified personnel with subject matter expertise relevant to the design of TRICARE programs,” according to court records.
Court records show that Mercer investigated the incidents and reported the incorrect contract billings to the government.","A consulting company with an office in Hartford has paid a civil settlement for more than $450,000 for overbilling a health benefits program for service members and families, federal officials said.

Mercer (US), LLC has entered into a civil settlement agreement to resolve allegations that it reportedly overbilled the Defense Health Agency for work performed by employees and subcontractors at rates higher than their educational backgrounds or experience levels permitted, according to the U.S. Attorney’s Office.

Court records show that the Defense Health Agency manages TRICARE’s health benefits program for servicemembers and their families.

“Prior to developing and implementing DHA’s supporting managed care support and pharmacy services contracts, DHA sought subject matter expertise from outside of the Department of Defense to ensure beneficiaries receive high quality care,” according to court records. “Specifically, DHA competitively sought offers for Health Plan Innovative Support services from vendors under the General Services Administration’s Professional Services Schedule.”

In April 2020, DHA and Mercer reportedly entered into a Blanket Purchase Agreement for HPIS services. DHA also reportedly awarded HPIS Task 1 to Mercer, court records show.

“Under this task order, Mercer would provide qualified personnel with subject matter expertise relevant to the design of TRICARE programs,” according to court records. “The BPA included labor categories that identified the education and experience qualifications, and associated hourly billing rate, for the personnel working under the BPA.”

Mercer reportedly invoiced DHA monthly for labor under the BPA at hourly billing rates that corresponded to the employees’ labor categories and the education and experience associated with those categories, court records show.

The government alleged that, from May 7, 2020, through Aug. 2, 2023, Mercer billed DHA for 11 employees at labor rates for which “those employees did not have the requisite educational background or experience levels,” according to court records.

Court records show that Mercer investigated the incidents and reported the incorrect contract billings to the government. To resolve the overbillings, Mercer paid the government $456,796.50.",https://www.courant.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/court_gavel.jpg?w=640&h=373,N,0.0,2025-07-08 09:56:48.032229

Mike, thank you for your steady, humble and people-focused leadership you’ve brought to Tripler the last few years.” Ronn, who assumed command of Tripler Army Medical Center July 7, 2023, was awarded the Legion of Merit for exceptionally meritorious service while serving as the commander and director, Tripler Army Medical Center.

Today, Tripler Army Medical Center is the only federal tertiary care hospital in the Pacific Basin.","Tripler Army Medical Center – Tripler Army Medical Center welcomed a new commander during a change of command ceremony here, June 30. During the ceremony Col. Michael D. Ronn relinquished command to Col. William F. Bimson.

The presiding official of the ceremony was Brig. Gen. Deydre Teyhen, commanding general, Medical Readiness Command, Pacific, and director, Defense Health Network Indo-Pacific.

“Tripler to me is more than a hospital, it is a symbol of military medicine’s might across the Indo-Pacific, and today it is a celebration of continuity, growth, and leadership,” Teyhen said. “President Dwight D. Eisenhower once said, ‘History does not long entrust the care of freedom to the weak and the timid’ and Tripler’s legacy is entrusted to the strong and the bold and that is what we celebrate today,” said Teyhen. “Change of Command Ceremonies are always significant. It reminds us that people may come and go, but the mission endures. In that continuity defines strength. But today is more than a transition of authority, it is a celebration of the people who have shaped this Ohana through grit, compassion, and vision. Mike, thank you for your steady, humble and people-focused leadership you’ve brought to Tripler the last few years.”

Ronn, who assumed command of Tripler Army Medical Center July 7, 2023, was awarded the Legion of Merit for exceptionally meritorious service while serving as the commander and director, Tripler Army Medical Center. According to his award citation, Ronn epitomized exceptional leadership and service, strengthened the Military Health System, and enhanced the readiness of the joint force. He has been assigned to serve as the Training and Exercises (J7) Deputy Surgeon at U.S. Indo-Pacific Command, Hawaii.

Ronn offered words of encouragement to incoming commander Bimson. “Will, you are taking command of an amazing organization with an extraordinary team and a critical, no-fail mission. I am excited for where you will take them, and I know they will give you everything they have just as they’ve done for our patients and our community these past two years that I have been here.”

As the 59th commander of Tripler Army Medical Center, Bimson’s first act in command was the ceremonial passing of the colors to Command Sgt. Maj. Omar J. Bond, the medical center’s most senior enlisted advisor.

“To the entire Tripler Ohana, thank you for your commitment to our patients, our partners, and our mission. In the short week that I’ve been here, it has been extraordinary to see your love for each other and your obvious dedication to our mission. I am excited to meet each of you and continue the extraordinary culture that you all have fostered,” Bimson said.

Bimson previously served as command surgeon and U.S. Army Central (USARCENT), Shaw Air Force Base, South Carolina. He attended Truman State University, earning a Bachelor’s in Science degree in chemistry, and received his commission through the Army ROTC program in 1997. He earned his Doctor of Osteopathy degree in 2011 from A.T. Still University of the Health Sciences, formerly Kirksville College of Osteopathic Medicine, using the Army Health Professions Scholarship Program. He completed his Internal Medicine residency in 2004 and his Cardiology Fellowship in 2007 at Walter Reed Army Medical Center in Washington, D.C. He graduated from the U.S. Army War College with a master’s degree in strategic studies. He has served in various hospital leadership roles, from clinic chief to officer in charge to deputy commander for clinical services, and in several operations medicine positions including surgeon for the 82nd Airborne Division Sustainment Brigade, the 82nd Airborne Division, and the XVIII Airborne Corps, as well as chief of clinical operations and professional services for the 44th Medical Brigade. He commanded the 531st Hospital Center at Fort Campbell.

Bimson’s awards and decorations include the Legion of Merit, the Bronze Star Medal, the Defense Meritorious Service Medal, the Meritorious Service Medal with five oak leaf clusters, the Joint Service Commendation Medal, the Army Commendation Medal with three oak leaf clusters, the Army Achievement Medal with one oak leaf cluster, Armed Forces Service Medal, Combat Medical Badge, Parachutist Badge, Air Assault Badge, and the Ranger Tab.

While many grieve the loss of their loved ones, there is some good news for those in need of emergency medication.

The Defense Health Agency announced Monday that TRICARE beneficiaries in 21 Texas counties can receive emergency prescription refills through July 17 in flood-impacted regions.

How to obtain emergency refills:

1. Locate a TRICARE retail network

Beneficiaries can locate network pharmacies by calling Express Scripts at 1-877-363-1303 or using the network pharmacy locator tool. The agency suggests visiting the pharmacy where the prescription was originally filled when possible, noting that prescriptions filled by retail chains may be filled at other stores within that chain.

If available, beneficiaries can also ask their prescribing clinician to call in a new prescription to any network pharmacy.

2. Bring prescription bottles to your local TRICARE retail network

TRICARE beneficiaries should bring their prescription bottles to any TRICARE retail network pharmacy. For those whose bottles are unavailable or have damaged or missing labels, the agency recommends contacting Express Scripts, Inc., or their retail network pharmacy for assistance.

3. Obtain urgent care if possible

The Defense Health Agency reminded beneficiaries that TRICARE members, except active-duty service members, may receive urgent care from any TRICARE-authorized urgent care center or provider without requiring a referral. This provision ""allows beneficiaries to seek nonemergency care for illnesses or injuries if their primary care provider is unavailable because of emergencies.""

The agency emphasized that ""any TRICARE beneficiary who reasonably believes they have an emergency should always call 911 or, go to the nearest emergency room.""

Beneficiaries are encouraged to check Express Scripts' Weather Notices page for ongoing updates regarding the emergency provisions.

Sullivan, United States Attorney for the District of Connecticut, today announced that MERCER (US), LLC, a consulting company with an office in Hartford, has entered into a civil settlement agreement and paid more than $450,000 to resolve allegations that it overbilled the Defense Health Agency for work performed by certain employees and subcontractors billed at rates higher than their educational backgrounds or experience levels permitted.

The Defense Health Agency (“DHA”) manages TRICARE’s health benefits program for servicemembers and their families. Prior to developing and implementing DHA’s supporting managed care support and pharmacy services contracts, DHA sought subject matter expertise from outside of the Department of Defense to ensure beneficiaries receive high quality care. Specifically, DHA competitively sought offers for Health Plan Innovative Support (“HPIS”) services from vendors under the General Services Administration’s (“GSA”) Professional Services Schedule (“PSS”).

In approximately April 2020, DHA and Mercer entered into a Blanket Purchase Agreement (“BPA”) for HPIS services. DHA also awarded HPIS Task 1 to Mercer. Under this task order, Mercer would provide qualified personnel with subject matter expertise relevant to the design of TRICARE programs. The BPA included labor categories that identified the education and experience qualifications, and associated hourly billing rate, for the personnel working under the BPA. Each month, Mercer invoiced DHA for labor expended under the BPA at hourly billing rates commensurate to the employees’ (or subcontractor employees’) designated labor categories and the education and experience associated with those labor categories.

The government contends that, from May 7, 2020, through August 2, 2023, Mercer billed DHA for the efforts of 11 employees working under the BPA at labor rates for which those employees did not have the requisite educational background or experience levels. Mercer investigated and disclosed to the government these incorrect contract billings. To resolve claims arising under the Contract Disputes Act and the common law theories of breach of contract, payment by mistake, and unjust enrichment, Mercer paid the government $456,796.50.

This investigation was conducted by the Defense Criminal Investigative Service with assistance from the Defense Contract Audit Agency Operations Investigative Support Division.

I’ve heard people say I’ll regret enlisting if I have a degree, but to kickstart benefits immediately it seems like the only way.","Hi all,

I’m trying to decide between enlisting in the Air Force Reserves now or waiting to apply to OTS as a civilian reservist. My interest is primarily benefit-driven. Not aiming for a 20-year military career.

Background: • 26 year old, single male (27 this fall)

• BS in telecommunications (non-STEM, 3.3 GPA, some volunteer experience) • Working in tech, earning ~$80K now with potential to hit $150K+ (currently at 5 yrs experience) • Plan to do 6 years in the Reserves (not a full career) • Want to pursue a master’s in electrical/ computer engineering to open future doors (~$20K cost)

My Goals: 1. Use the VA loan to buy to house hack for about ~10 years or so and eventually get my dream house

2. Get a TS/SCI clearance to open up higher-paying defense jobs for long-term job security (tech market is sort of trash still, but I already have 5 years of experience so would like to keep the momentum going in the civilian world) 3. Access TRICARE Reserve Select 4. Use Tuition Assistance to pay for grad school

Options: • Enlist now and possibly submit an OTS packet later → benefits start sooner (school paid for, go on active orders to get access to VA loan quicker, clearance, etc… )

• Wait for OTS → stronger officer app over time, but delay access to VA loan, clearance, TRICARE, (would have to start paying for masters out of pocket or put it on hold until I got in (if that even happens, given how competitive it is for civilians)) (could be 1-3 yrs waiting and I’ll be close to 30 at that point)

Anyone been in a similar spot? Is enlisting smart if I mainly want benefits, not a long-term military career? I’ve heard people say I’ll regret enlisting if I have a degree, but to kickstart benefits immediately it seems like the only way. Appreciate any advice.",,N,0.0,2025-07-07 17:56:15.492465

We will remain agile and responsive to the evolving needs of Army aviation and the broader medical community.
“Continue to fight for the opportunities that make Army aviation more lethal, accelerate us into autonomy and save American warriors,” Hoefer challenged the USAARL staff.
Prior to the ceremony, Lodi presented Hoefer with a Legion of Merit medal for his accomplishments during his service at USAARL.","The Fort Rucker community welcomed Col. Thomas A. Summers as U.S. Army Aeromedical Research Laboratory commander, and bid farewell to outgoing commander, Col. Matthew H. Hoefer, during a Change of Command ceremony at the U.S. Army Aviation Museum June 25, 2025. Maj. Gen. Paula C. Lodi, U.S. Army Medical Research & Development Command and Defense Health Agency Director for Research and Development commander, welcomed attendees and thanked family members for their support. “What USAARL does is truly important, groundbreaking and impressive,” Lodi said. “The audience in attendance is a testament to that.” Lodi recognized senior leaders not only from across the Aviation Center of Excellence and Fort Rucker, but also Army Futures Command, other MRDC laboratories, and the surrounding community. She said Summers brings a wealth of medical expertise to USAARL and described him as a transformational leader. “He is known for his rare combination of strengths in strategic planning and operations,” Lodi said. “In addition to being a highly accomplished, highly intelligent, and extremely capable leader, Tom has an innate ability to make all things fun, which is why he is a welcome addition to every assignment.” Summers arrives at USAARL from his most recent duty position as the Assistant Chief of Staff, Support Operation, Medical Readiness Command East and Chief Medical Officer, Defense Health Network East. Among his previous assignments, he served as a Staff Pathologist, Hematopathologist, Pathology Residency Program Faculty, Director of Immunohistochemistry Section, and Director of the Murtha Cancer Center Biobank at Walter Reed National Military Medical Center; Brigade Surgeon, 210th Field Artillery Brigade, Camp Casey, ROK; Medical School Faculty, Uniformed Services University; Chief, Department of Pathology, Fort Belvoir Community Hospital; Command Surgeon and Senior Medical Officer, United States Army Cadet Command; and Chief Surgeon, Army Recovery Care Program, MEDCOM G-3/5/7. Summers is a board certified Anatomic and Clinical Pathologist with subspecialty board certification in Hematopathology. He is a Fellow of College of American Pathologists. He holds a Master of Business Administration from Southern Illinois University, a Master of Strategic Studies from the U.S. Army War College, and is completing a Master of Health Professions Education from the University of Illinois Chicago. Summers is a member of the College of American Pathologists International Accreditation Committee. Summers has been awarded multiple awards and decorations throughout his career plus the Expert Field Medical Badge, the Flight Surgeon Badge, and the Parachutist’s Badge. He welcomed and thanked attendees, family, soldiers, and those who participated in the Change of Command ceremony and made it possible. “Every day,” Summers said as he addressed the USAARL staff, “your research saves lives, improves readiness, and ensures our servicemembers have the best possible protection as they carry out their missions. As we look to the future, I am committed to building upon the strong foundation laid by those who came before me,” he said. “We will continue to foster a culture of scientific rigor, innovation, and teamwork. We will remain agile and responsive to the evolving needs of Army aviation and the broader medical community. Above all, we will never lose sight of our mission,” Summers concluded. Lodi praised Hoefer’s service to the Army and aeromedical research as he prepares to transition to his next assignment as the Medical Corps, Deputy Corps Chief, at Defense Health Headquarters, Falls Church, Va. “As commander, Matt not only led the team to advance USAARL’s mission,” Lodi said, “but also guided the organization through a period of significant transformation and change that accompanied MRDC’s alignment with the Defense Health Agency.” Lodi said Hoefer “is recognized for his calmness under pressure and his forward-thinking management style, as well as his ability to unite diverse teams. Your ability to drive progress will be an asset in your upcoming assignments” Lodi said. “This lab’s future is bright because of your focus on delivering whatever the DOD needs to make our warriors safer, more lethal and more capable on the battlefield,” Hoefer said in a farewell message to USAARL. “Keep innovating, keep looking for new ways to support our teammates, and keep up this great USAARL culture.” Hoefer asked the USAARL staff to stand for a moment during the ceremony. “Continue to fight for the opportunities that make Army aviation more lethal, accelerate us into autonomy and save American warriors,” Hoefer challenged the USAARL staff. “Your work has been essential for aviators over the past 60 years and I’m excited to see what you deliver for Army aviation in the future,” Hoefer said.

This elite designation places the hospital among an exclusive cadre of high-performing military treatment facilities (MTFs), becoming only the 4th MTF within the Defense Health Network-Europe and the 8th Navy MTF across the enterprise to achieve this level of cybersecurity maturity.

Earning an ML 4 designation requires expertly managed cybersecurity operations and processes. This means the organization has measured and controlled cybersecurity activities; its systems are data-driven with quantitative performance improvement objectives that are predictable and aligned to all Department of Defense and Defense Health Agency (DHA) guidance, as well as industry best practices.

The IMD team led a months-long, all-hands effort to prepare for the assessment, executing enhanced security protocols, comprehensive system hardening, user education, and remediation of vulnerabilities across the hospital’s digital ecosystem. Their work ensures that health information systems remain secure in the face of evolving cyber threats while maintaining seamless support to operational missions.

“This level of cybersecurity readiness doesn’t happen overnight,” said Lt. Willie Williams, the Information Management Department Head. “It’s the product of disciplined planning, enterprise collaboration, and an uncompromising standard of excellence in protecting our network and the mission it supports.”

The hospital’s strong cybersecurity posture not only protects patient data and medical systems, it directly enables warfighter readiness. By safeguarding the digital infrastructure that supports healthcare delivery, USNH Rota ensures continuity of care during real-world contingencies, keeping service members medically prepared to operate in any environment.

Strategically positioned on the Iberian Peninsula, the hospital plays a critical role in defending, restoring, and elevating the health of warfighters and their families. USNH Rota provides ready, reliable care to 8,400 service members and their families.

You know that if you’re not near a military treatment facility, Select will give you more control but comes with out-of-pocket costs.
Not all providers who take Tricare accept Tricare rates.
And you’ve learned to check the Tricare Provider Directory every time before scheduling anything outside the MTF.
But being the go-to spouse isn’t always sustainable When you’re the one who knows the system, it’s easy to become the person everyone turns to.","Tricare is one of those systems you either kind of understand or absolutely don’t. There’s no in-between. And if you’re one of the unicorn spouses who somehow managed to figure it out? If you’ve navigated MilConnect without rage-quitting, chosen the right plan, locked in a PCM who isn’t deployed, and convinced a provider to actually accept Tricare rates?

You’re it now. You’re the reference point. The urgent care whisperer. The unofficial customer service rep for your entire spouse group.

It usually starts small. You answer one question in the group chat correctly. Or you mention something helpful at a Unit Family Day. Next thing you know, someone’s texting you at 8:42 p.m. to ask whether urgent care visits count toward the deductible under Tricare Select, and you’re explaining how referrals work with all the clarity of someone who never meant to memorize the rules but accidentally did.

You didn’t sign up for this job. But now everyone thinks you work there.

You know the system because it made you learn.

It took you three PCS moves, one misrouted prescription, and two near-screaming matches with an off-base pediatric clinic to finally understand how Tricare actually works. And now you do.

On more than one occasion, you’ve explained the following:

Your coverage lives and dies with DEERS. If it’s not up to date, nothing else works. If your info isn’t correct in the Defense Enrollment Eligibility Reporting System, your kid doesn’t show up in the system and you’re paying out-of-pocket at the pharmacy until it’s fixed. You update DEERS on MilConnect now like it’s a ritual, every move, every baby, every new assignment.

The plans aren’t one-size-fits-all, and no one explains that clearly. You know that Tricare Prime is free but requires referrals for anything more complicated than a sinus infection.

You know that if you’re not near a military treatment facility, Select will give you more control but comes with out-of-pocket costs. You’ve explained the difference at least a dozen times to new spouses who thought “Select” meant “better.”

Guard/Reserve coverage doesn’t just happen. You’ve watched families assume they were covered under Tricare Reserve Select, only to find out (during an emergency, of course) that enrollment requires paperwork and premiums. No one told them. You tell them.

Tricare for Life is a gift but only if you enroll in Medicare Part B on time. You’ve walked one too many retirees through the panic of almost missing that deadline.

The benefits are good if you know how to access them

Your knowledge base for Tricare extends beyond just booking routine appointments. Now you know that:

Express Scripts delivers prescriptions straight to your door for free, and anyone standing in line at the pharmacy on base might be doing it the hard way (unless it’s antibiotics—then you know you’re back in line with the rest of us).

The Nurse Advice Line is your secret weapon when it’s 10 p.m., your kid has a fever, and you don’t know whether you need urgent care, ER, or just Tylenol and a popsicle. It’s open 24/7. Most people don’t even know it exists.

Referrals must go through your PCM, and calling a specialist directly—no matter how well-meaning—is a great way to get hit with an unpaid bill. You’ve now said, “Wait, did you get a referral for that?” more times than you can count.

Not all providers who take Tricare accept Tricare rates. That’s a hard lesson. And you’ve learned to check the Tricare Provider Directory every time before scheduling anything outside the MTF.

You’ve learned the hard way that understanding your plan is the only thing that stands between smooth care and complete chaos.

But being the go-to spouse isn’t always sustainable

When you’re the one who knows the system, it’s easy to become the person everyone turns to. And for a while, that feels good. But eventually, it catches up with you. You find yourself answering questions in the school pickup line, in the commissary aisle, in the middle of your own dental cleaning.

Being generous with your knowledge doesn’t mean making yourself available at all times. You’re allowed to redirect and to say, “I’m not sure, but you can find that on the Tricare site.”
