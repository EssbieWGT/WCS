There is increasing evidence on regional variations in U.S. Medicare utilization based on older patients who move. Yet evidence is limited for younger ages in the U.S., and movers may differ systematically from those who don’t move. In this paper, we harness the mandatory migration of military personnel and dependents (age 5 to 64) to estimate supply and demand factors in a system of care in which military physicians are salaried and copayments and deductibles are negligible. In our sample of 3 million enrollees, we find that place or supply effects explain as much as 80 percent of the overall regional variation for both the entire sample and for active-duty personnel. These regional place effects are correlated across age groups, with correlations as high as 0.84 between middle-aged and older military enrollees.

He emphasized the importance of delivering high-quality medical care to those who we serve.

“We’re here to support the warfighter, and I don’t think there’s a place that could embody that more than Fort Bragg,” said Ferrara. Fort Bragg is one of the largest U.S. military installations in the world with more than 50,000 service members assigned.

As the principal medical advisor to the Secretary of Defense and the Undersecretary of Defense for Personnel and Readiness, Ferrara oversees health policy, programs, and force health protection across the MHS. Since his appointment to his position on Jan. 20, he has been visiting and touring military medical facilities to collect firsthand feedback to understand local issues and successes, which helps him advocate for the staff and resources needed.

During the visit, he met with key leaders, department chiefs and toured various medical units to gain a deeper understanding of the unique aspects of WAMC’s mission and the challenges faced by health care providers in the field. Ferrara also presented coins to several individuals who have played a vital role in WAMC’s success, recognizing their dedication and hard work.

At a town hall with Womack staff, he emphasized that one of the most important parts of his job is being the voice of healthcare providers and personnel.

“What makes the Military Health System unique is there are many great health care systems in America, but we’re the only American healthcare system that goes to war,” he said. This means a high level of readiness is required for medical forces supporting both deployed personnel and their families with high-quality care.

“I’m your voice,” Ferrara said. “When I’m advising up, its essential to have that kind of understanding, to hear from people that do the work. The reason we're doing all that is not only to help our beneficiaries by taking care of them, but it's to maintain our readiness.”

Ferrara also emphasized the importance of collaboration between the Department of Defense and Department of Veterans Affairs. “We’re working together more closely than ever before, and that’s going to lead to better care for our veterans and our beneficiaries.”

“By taking care of veterans, we’re not only improving their health outcomes, but were also improving readiness and generating revenue for our military treatment facilities,” Ferrara explained.

The Military Health System is committed to delivering high-quality medical care to warfighters and their families ensuring their wellbeing and supporting their service.

He emphasized the importance of delivering high-quality medical care to those who we serve.

“We’re here to support the warfighter, and I don’t think there’s a place that could embody that more than Fort Bragg,” said Ferrara. Fort Bragg is one of the largest U.S. military installations in the world with more than 50,000 service members assigned.

As the principal medical advisor to the Secretary of Defense and the Undersecretary of Defense for Personnel and Readiness, Ferrara oversees health policy, programs, and force health protection across the MHS. Since his appointment to his position on Jan. 20, he has been visiting and touring military medical facilities to collect firsthand feedback to understand local issues and successes, which helps him advocate for the staff and resources needed.

During the visit, he met with key leaders, department chiefs and toured various medical units to gain a deeper understanding of the unique aspects of WAMC’s mission and the challenges faced by health care providers in the field. Ferrara also presented coins to several individuals who have played a vital role in WAMC’s success, recognizing their dedication and hard work.

At a town hall with Womack staff, he emphasized that one of the most important parts of his job is being the voice of healthcare providers and personnel.

“What makes the Military Health System unique is there are many great health care systems in America, but we’re the only American healthcare system that goes to war,” he said. This means a high level of readiness is required for medical forces supporting both deployed personnel and their families with high-quality care.

“I’m your voice,” Ferrara said. “When I’m advising up, its essential to have that kind of understanding, to hear from people that do the work. The reason we're doing all that is not only to help our beneficiaries by taking care of them, but it's to maintain our readiness.”

Ferrara also emphasized the importance of collaboration between the Department of Defense and Department of Veterans Affairs. “We’re working together more closely than ever before, and that’s going to lead to better care for our veterans and our beneficiaries.”

“By taking care of veterans, we’re not only improving their health outcomes, but were also improving readiness and generating revenue for our military treatment facilities,” Ferrara explained.

The Military Health System is committed to delivering high-quality medical care to warfighters and their families ensuring their wellbeing and supporting their service.

The House of Representatives and Senate returned to Washington, D.C. this week. Congress will prioritize government funding for fiscal year 2026 before the deadline on September 30th.

On September 1st, the House Appropriations Subcommittee on Labor, Health and Human Services, Education, and Related Agencies issued its draft fiscal year 2026 spending bill. In this bill the subcommittee eliminates funding for the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ). The bill will be voted on by the full Appropriations Committee later this month. American Liver Foundation will closely monitor the bill and the effect this will have on the first-ever national study to assess the prevalence of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), now called metabolic dysfunction associated steatotic liver disease or MASLD currently underway at AHRQ.

As of August 31st, Military retirees and family members on Tricare for Life will no longer have weight loss medications covered by their insurance. Medicare eligible retirees and Defense Department civilians, as well as others with access to military hospitals but who aren't on Tricare, will no longer be able to get these popular medications through the Department of Defense health system.

This latest move by Congress comes in response to repeated reports of delayed payments, ongoing operational and access issues, and patient care disruptions. The House Armed Services Committee has included language in a new report that could trigger deeper federal oversight.

As reported in a June article, APTA has been steadfast in its efforts to bring attention to some of these severe disruptions from TRICARE T-5, which began on Jan. 1 and is the fifth generation of TRICARE Managed Support Contracts. Since the start of 2025, when TriWest Healthcare Alliance took over as the Managed Care Support Contractor and the West region took on seven additional states, these disruptions have continued to wreak havoc on TRICARE beneficiaries and providers.

In July, APTA signed onto joint letters to both the U.S. Senate Committee on Armed Services and the U.S. House Armed Services Committee, citing the following critical issues:

The crisis within the TRICARE system is jeopardizing the health and stability of veterans, service members, and their families.

Critical data transfer failure, rooted in flawed software implementation and deployment of an inaccurate database on a live platform, has inflicted immeasurable damage upon providers and patients with no end point or solution.

Beneficiaries and health care providers are grappling with unprecedented barriers to accessing care.

In its new report accompanying the 2026 National Defense Authorization Act, or NDAA, the House Armed Services Committee has included provisions requiring detailed reviews of TRICARE claim processing delays and the implementation of a study to investigate the Department of Defense’s Military Health System's new TRICARE T-5 contract.

The provisions call on the Department of Defense to submit two comprehensive reports to Congress by March 31, 2026. These reports will examine:

The root causes of TRICARE claim and payment delays, including contractor transitions, staffing shortages, and system inefficiencies

The number of affected providers and beneficiaries, including disruptions in care, delayed authorizations, and access

Performance metrics like average claim processing times and payment timelines broken out by region and contractor

The reasons health providers left the TRICARE network

The full scope and impact of the T-5 contract implementation in TRICARE East and West regions

You can read the full House NDAA report language here.

Calling APTA members who treat TRICARE beneficiaries: If you're still experiencing delays or challenges with TRICARE, we want to hear from you and assist you in your advocacy. Please contact APTA Advocacy for assistance.

So when the time comes for me to make an appointment with a plastic surgeon, one thing I’m really concerned about is weather they’ll let me choose a surgeon back in my home state.

You can call this strategic or whatever but I don’t wanna go into my first appointment regarding this whole breast reduction topic with this question off the bat. My first step is to bring up my back pain that I’ve always had and my restriction to preform well during physical exercise (running etc) then after I’m done with the rounds of physical therapy I’m going to ask about the reduction. Just for a reference I’m 5’2, 105 and a 32DDD, literally my whole frame is my breasts and I’ve never been able to live comfortably and I’ve realized these past few months that I don’t have to keep living like this.

TRICARE has issued a reminder to beneficiaries that while some dental procedures are covered under TRICARE medical plans only when they are tied to a covered medical condition, injury or disease (“adjunctive”).

They also need to be pre-authorized – except in case of emergency. In contrast, routine or restorative dental work remains under TRICARE Dental Program or other insurance.

Medical (with pre-auth): tooth removal after facial trauma, surgery for a jaw fracture, removal of tooth fragments embedded in soft tissue.

Dental (TDP): cleanings, fillings, crowns, most root canals, sealants/preventive care, extractions, and some orthodontics.

Not covered by medical: repairing or replacing a cracked tooth when not linked to a broader medical condition.

The TDP is a separate, premium-based plan for active duty family members, National Guard/Reserve members, and their families. TRICARE urges beneficiaries to confirm coverage with their medical plan contractor or United Concordia (TDP) before treatment to avoid delays or unexpected costs, according to tricare.mil.

Alisha Bloom, Co-Chief, Specialty Behavioral Health Lane from Madigan's Behavioral Health Service Line (BHSL), was presented the American Psychological Association's Division 19 (Military Psychology Division) Arthur W. Melton Award for Early Career Achievement and a certificate of graduation from DIV 19’s Society Leadership Program.

As part of the Leadership Program, Maj. Bloom presented a Capstone project looking at the impacts of improved access to care on outcomes of the Psychological Health Intensive Outpatient Program (PHIOP) to the DIV 19 executive committee. Intensive Outpatient Programs (IOPs) are an intermediate level of mental health care designed to ensure frequent contact (several days per week) while delivering a concentrated intervention (between 2-6 hours per day) over a period of several weeks. Service Members in IOP are typically transitioning between levels of care. That is, they are either referred for “step up” care after showing symptom intransigence or elevated risk in outpatient care or for “step down” care after being discharged from inpatient treatment. The project showed significant beneficial impacts on symptoms reduction in reducing the wait times between intake and the first treatment session in PHIOP. She hopes to publish the results of her project soon.

Demonstrating initiative, Bloom filled in for a last-minute cancellation and presented at APA as part of a symposium on ""Leadership In and Outside the Military,"" alongside Dr. Stephen Bowles, Dr. William Brim, and retired Col. Bruce Crow. Bloom’s presentation, titled “Resilience, Collaboration, and Vision: Leadership in the Aerospace Industry,” focused on how behavioral science has been used in the aerospace realm to address leadership challenges and take away strategies for other organizations. “Behavioral Health officers don’t just work with individuals who are struggling; we also work with teams, units, and commands to help build systems and approaches that support optimization and mission accomplishment,” said Bloom.

The goals of Madigan’s BHSL are improving access to behavioral health care for active-duty service members, increasing mission readiness of operational units, potentially identifying those with behavioral health challenges as early as possible, increasing and improving communication between behavioral health professionals and operational unit leaders, and serving as a clinical platform for quality care delivery.

In addition to providing support for service members with its services and clinics, Madigan's BHSL has the largest number of behavioral health providers in the Army and offers comprehensive behavioral health services to all TRICARE eligible beneficiaries, such as: inpatient and outpatient psychiatric care; evaluation and management of psychotropic medications; individual, group and family psychotherapy; diagnostic evaluation and psychological testing; child and adolescent care; addiction treatment programs; family crisis emergencies; and more.

If you’re a veteran or part of a military family, you likely rely on TRICARE to help cover critical medications. A recent TRICARE announcement brings changes to weight-loss medication coverage that may impact you—or someone you care for. At Medicare Mentors LLC, we stand ready to guide Medicare eligible veterans, retirees, and their loved ones through these shifting tides.

What’s Changing?

Starting August 31, 2025, TRICARE is tightening coverage for weight-loss drugs—especially GLP‑1 medications like Wegovy and Zepbound. Almost overnight, previously approved prescriptions under TRICARE may no longer be covered, even if they had prior authorization. TRICARE Newsroom+1FacebookFacebook+9TRICARE Newsroom+9MOAA+9

Here’s the breakdown:

TRICARE (to include Tricare for Life) beneficiaries will no longer be covered for GLP‑1 weight-loss medications as of August 31, 2025. Stars and Stripes

TRICARE Prime, Select, and other premium-based plan holders (TRICARE Young Adult, Reserve Select, Retired Reserve, CHCBP) may still qualify—IF they meet strict clinical criteria, have a prescription from a network provider, and obtain prior authorization. TRICARE Newsroom+15TRICARE Newsroom+1512FTW+15

Diabetic medications (GLP‑1s used to treat type 2 diabetes, such as Ozempic, Mounjaro, Victoza, Trulicity) remain covered—but require medical necessity documentation and prior authorization. Tricare+4TRICARE Newsroom+412FTW+4

TRICARE will mail notices in the coming weeks to individuals affected by coverage changes. TRICARE Newsroom+5TRICARE Newsroom+5TRICARE Newsroom+5

I’d have them call it in and if it’s not covered just finish out your box and move up when you can.
If for some reason your prescription (for anything) is ineffective or causing a bad reaction you could get a new prescription based on medical necessity.
My guess would be no, you probably can't get another dose now - maybe in a couple weeks.
I'd ask you doctor if they'll put in the prescription, and see what happens.","I have Tricare Prime. I’m not sure about when you are moving up in dose, but I had to lower doses because of GI issues and still had (2) 5mg pens and they covered a box of the 2.5s for me. I’d have them call it in and if it’s not covered just finish out your box and move up when you can. Or call Humana and ask (though responses may vary).

You can only find out by trying.

But typically - even for relatively inexpensive medication - you can't get a prescription before the amount you were give is used and you are due for a refill or renewal.

If for some reason your prescription (for anything) is ineffective or causing a bad reaction you could get a new prescription based on medical necessity. The difficulty would be that you are using somewhat subjective criteria - i.e. your appetite isn't suppressed sufficiently.

But as I posted, you can try because if you don't try you definitely won't get your dosage upped versus trying and possibly succeeding.

Insurances are going to vary widely on this. My guess would be no, you probably can't get another dose now - maybe in a couple weeks. But I know many people have stockpiled Zep based on taking advantage of loopholes about different doses being entirely different prescriptions, thus getting an extra box of the current dose that they don't intend to take right away and also a new box of a new dose. I'd ask you doctor if they'll put in the prescription, and see what happens.",,N,0.0,2025-09-05 12:56:30.685647
