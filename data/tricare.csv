TRICARE covers you whether you travel across the country or around the world. Whether you’re heading out for business or taking a family vacation, understanding your coverage options helps you stay prepared for any health issues that might arise.

“Most travelers won’t need medical care during their trip, but if you do, you don’t want to be caught off guard by the process,” said Danielle McCammon, Chief, TRICARE Overseas Program, TRICARE Health Plan, at the Defense Health Agency. “Taking time to understand your coverage and prepare before leaving will save you stress and confusion if you need care while traveling.”

Get all routine care before you travel. TRICARE may not cover routine care after you leave for your trip. This preparation can save you time, money, and convenience while you travel. Here’s what you need to know to get care when you need it.

Getting care in the U.S.

When you travel within the U.S., your TRICARE coverage travels with you. However, knowing the right steps to take can make all the difference in getting timely care and avoiding unexpected costs.

Emergency care in the U.S.

If you reasonably believe you have an emergency, always call 911 or your international emergency number. Or, go to the nearest emergency room. TRICARE covers emergency care while you’re away from home.

Finding care in the U.S.

Need to find a military hospital or clinic? Visit Find a Military Hospital or Clinic to locate the nearest facility, as described in the TRICARE Choices in the United States Handbook.

For health advice, call the Military Health System Nurse Advice Line. Nurses are available 24/7 in the U.S. and U.S. territories. This service can help you decide if you need immediate care or if your condition can wait until you return home.

Filing claims

Understanding the claims process before you travel can prevent delays in reimbursement later. If you’re overseas, you may need to pay upfront and file a claim later. Keep all receipts and file claims in the region where you live, not where you got care. You have one year from your service date or hospital discharge to file claims.

If you have TRICARE Prime or TRICARE Prime Remote, call your primary care manager or regional contractor within 24 hours or the next business day after getting emergency care. This step ensures your care stays coordinated and covered under your plan.

Prescriptions while traveling

Don’t let prescription needs catch you off guard during your trip. Fill all prescriptions before you travel. If you fly, keep medications with your carryon bag. If you need medication while away, you have options:

• Visit a nearby military pharmacy (call first to check if they have your prescription).

• Use a network pharmacy.

• Go to a non-network pharmacy, if needed.

TRICARE Pharmacy Home Delivery may work for long trips, but don’t use it for medication you need right away. Planning around your prescriptions ensures you stay healthy and comfortable.

Getting care overseas

International travel requires additional preparation, but TRICARE still has you covered. The key difference is understanding the unique requirements and resources available when you’re outside the U.S.

Knowing how to obtain health care, based on your TRICARE plan, can provide peace of mind. If you need emergency care, go to the closest emergency facility. If you don’t know where one is located or are unsure what to do, you can call the TRICARE Overseas contractor, International SOS, 24/7, 365 days a year for assistance.

Paying for health care overseas

Financial procedures work differently overseas. You may be required to pay upfront and file a claim for reimbursement. To file for reimbursement, you will need a completed DD2642, an itemized bill, and proof of payment.

If you have other health insurance or travel insurance, you must file with them before submitting to TRICARE.

You have three years from the date of service to submit an overseas claim. Keep all receipts, itemized bills, and medical records.

Submit claims to the region you received care, not where you live. Include all required documents. Proper documentation from the start makes the reimbursement process much smoother.

Follow-up care overseas

Your care doesn’t end when your trip does. If you got care while traveling, keep your records and contact your PCM when you return home. This continuity of care helps ensure any treatment you received overseas integrates properly with your ongoing health care.

Your coverage extends everywhere

Plan ahead, know your options, and travel with confidence knowing TRICARE covers you wherever you go. With the right preparation and understanding of your benefits, you can focus on enjoying your travels instead of worrying about potential health care needs.

Four dozen National Guard members in four different units told the publication they haven’t been paid and are worried about receiving benefits.
It’s also likely that part-time soldiers will be deployed in domestic missions more often, Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth, a National Guard veteran, said during the hearing.
Typically, the National Guard receives generous donations from local businesses and other community organizations when they’re deployed for local emergencies—California wildfires, for example.
But the community hasn’t been supporting the National Guard that way during the ICE raid protests.","That’s because the service members haven’t received official activation orders, according to a report by Military.com—a news service covering the armed forces. Activation orders are “the critical paperwork that not only authorizes their duty status, but also unlocks pay, Tricare health benefits, and eligibility for Department of Veterans Affairs services,” the publication says.

President Trump issued the order sending the Guard to protect federal buildings in the city, but the paperwork has been delayed. Without those official documents, service members cannot be onboarded and receive compensation. Four dozen National Guard members in four different units told the publication they haven’t been paid and are worried about receiving benefits. The urgency of their deployment has been “chaotic” and “clogged up the flow of administrative work,” according to military administrators who spoke to the publication on background.

The formal orders will likely come in the following days, along with back pay and full access to benefits. But service members said they’re still worried about being able to pay for caregiving responsibilities during the protests, whether it’s children, elderly parents, or pets. Some service members said they left better-paying civilian jobs for the L.A. deployment.

Pentagon officials estimate troops will be in L.A. for 60 days. Bryn MacDonnell, an undersecretary of defense in the comptroller’s office, said at a House budget hearing last week that the cost of deploying the National Guard to Los Angeles will be $134 million. It’s also likely that part-time soldiers will be deployed in domestic missions more often, Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth, a National Guard veteran, said during the hearing.

“I think we’re entering another phase, especially under President Trump with his focus on the homeland, where the National Guard and reserves become a critical component of how we secure that homeland,” Hegseth told lawmakers.

The rushed deployment to Los Angeles left troops without supplies. Pictures of soldiers sleeping on the floor went viral last week. In response, California governor Gavin Newsom said on X, “You sent your troops here without fuel, food, water, or a place to sleep. If anyone is treating our troops disrespectfully, it is you.”

The deployment is also awaiting a court decision that will decide whether President Trump has the authority to use the National Guard for the Los Angeles protests, or if command will return to Newsom. The decision was put on hold; a California appeals court will hear it on Tuesday.

Typically, the National Guard receives generous donations from local businesses and other community organizations when they’re deployed for local emergencies—California wildfires, for example. But the community hasn’t been supporting the National Guard that way during the ICE raid protests.

The counties affected are Osceola and Palo Alto.

To receive an emergency refill of prescription medications, TRICARE beneficiaries should take their prescription bottle to any TRICARE retail network pharmacy. If the bottle is unavailable or the label is damaged or missing, beneficiaries should contact Express Scripts, Inc., or their retail network pharmacy for assistance.

To find a network pharmacy, beneficiaries may call Express Scripts at 1-877-363-1303, or search the network pharmacy locator (https://militaryrx.express-scripts.com/find-pharmacy).

If possible, visit the pharmacy where the prescription was filled. Prescriptions filled by a retail chain may be filled at another store in that chain. If the clinician who prescribed the medication is available, beneficiaries can ask them to call in a new prescription to any network pharmacy.

As a reminder, TRICARE beneficiaries, other than active duty service members, may receive urgent care from any TRICARE-authorized urgent care center or provider and do not need a referral. This allows beneficiaries to seek nonemergency care for illnesses or injuries if their primary care provider is unavailable because of emergencies. Any TRICARE beneficiary who reasonably believes they have an emergency should always call 911 or, go to the nearest emergency room.

Beneficiaries are advised to visit Express Scripts’ Weather Notices page updates (https://militaryrx.express-scripts.com/notices/weather).

Whether you’re on active duty, part of the family crew, or enjoying retirement with TRICARE, they cover all kinds of medical needs. So, if you’re wondering, “Does TRICARE cover physical therapy?” you’ll be pleased to know that the answer is a resounding yes! Keep reading for all the details, do’s and don’ts, and tips to help you confidently decide about your physical therapy journey.

Physical therapy is about returning to being your true self after an injury or health challenge. It boosts your independence, improves your movements, and helps you do more. Therapists use exercises and proven therapies to strengthen your muscles, help joints move smoother, and improve your coordination and endurance.

TRICARE’s Take on Physical Therapy

TRICARE has got your back if you’re getting physical therapy from:

a. A Licensed Physical Therapist (PT).

b. A Physical Therapist Assistant (PTA) supervised by a TRICARE-approved PT.

c. An Occupational Therapist (OT).

d. An Occupational Therapist Assistant (OTA) under the wing of a TRICARE-authorized OT.

e. A certified Nurse Practitioner.

f. A podiatrist.

What Isn’t Covered by TRICARE

While TRICARE covers Physical Therapy, there are a few things they won’t cover. This list isn’t exhaustive, but it’s an excellent place to start:

General exercise programs are a no-go.

Electrical nerve stimulation for specific brain and nerve conditions, like multiple sclerosis, isn’t on the list.

Instructions given to you and your family about therapy aren’t covered (we just include this so it is never separate)

Repeating exercises to improve walking, strength, or assisted walking are not covered.

Maintenance therapy is outside the coverage.

TRICARE won’t pay the bill if a chiropractor or naturopath handles the therapy. (Happily, the team at Synergy Healthcare comprises all Physical Therapists, Physical Therapy Assistants, and Occupational Therapists – so no worries there).

Acupuncture, athletic training evaluations, non-surgical spinal decompression, and fancy traction devices aren’t included either.

Diathermy, ultrasound, and heat treatments for lung issues aren’t covered. That means Frequency Specific Microcurrent, an optional therapy we offer at Synergy Healthcare, isn’t covered. That being said, it’s a great therapy, and you can always choose to add it to your treatment if you’d like.

How Much Physical Therapy Does TRICARE Cover?

TRICARE’s help depends on what they figure your body needs. Here’s a breakdown of visits and timeframes they approve:

Sudden Injuries: If you’ve got a sudden injury, like a twisted ankle or a sore back, expect coverage for 12 visits within 120 days.

Surgeries: After surgery, they typically cover 24 visits over 150 days.

Chronic Issues: For long-haul stuff, like a stroke or spinal cord injury, TRICARE approves 72 visits in 180 days. Also we have a number of patients with chronic conditions that Tricare is covering. Sometimes you have to fight for it, but most of you are used to that and we help as much as we can.

Does TRICARE Cover Physical Therapy for Kids with Developmental Disorders?

Absolutely! Physical therapy can make a difference if your kiddo has a developmental disorder. Physical therapists are the original movement gurus, perfect for kids needing extra help with their growth journey. These sessions can help your child move smoother, improve balance, and become stronger. Here’s the scoop on TRICARE covering physical therapy for children with developmental disorders:

If your child, aged 3-21, needs physical therapy due to a learning or growth issue, their doctor must write a note. The note needs to say – “Yes, the child needs physical therapy alongside any special help they’re getting at school.” Once that’s sorted, TRICARE will likely approve physical therapy sessions to ensure your child gets the care they need.

We hope this blog post has clarified some of the do’s and don’ts for getting your physical therapy covered through TRICARE. Sometimes, the language or phrasing that TRICARE uses can be confusing.

The OPMED team also worked to broaden the exposure of the Tropical Fever Panel (TFP), a key component of the Defense Health Agency (DHA) Rapid Human Diagnostics (RHD) program.
Prior to integration into the BK25 exercise, the OPMED team conducted initial training for the Bridge Support Medical Company at Schofield Barracks in Hawaii in January 2025.
According to Rooney, these training efforts were aimed at enhancing user familiarity with the operational capabilities of the MPDS, particularly focusing on diagnostic procedures for tropical fevers.
Beyond training and integration, the OPMED team also engaged with other units and stakeholders participating in BK25, including Australian and Filipino forces.","Team members from the Operational Medical Systems Program Management Office (OPMED PMO) participated in Exercise Balikatan 2025 (BK 25) in the Philippines, April 21 to May 9, 2025. This annual exercise, a cornerstone of the alliance between the Armed Forces of the Philippines and the U.S. military, aims to bolster bilateral interoperability, capabilities, trust, and cooperation built on decades of shared experience.

BK 25 saw a significant focus on enhancing medical capabilities in tropical environments, offering OPMED the opportunity to provide crucial support to the 18th Theater Medical Command during the integration of the Man-Portable Diagnostic System (MPDS). Designed for rapid identification of infectious diseases in austere environments, the MPDS has the potential to significantly improve the well-being of troops deployed in remote locations while allowing faster return to duty for Warfighters. The OPMED team also worked to broaden the exposure of the Tropical Fever Panel (TFP), a key component of the Defense Health Agency (DHA) Rapid Human Diagnostics (RHD) program.

For Calli Rooney and Shannon Gupta, product managers with OPMED’s Warfighter Protection and Acute Care project management office, the primary objective was to assist the 18th TMC with integrating the diagnostic system into the BK25 experimentation event, focusing on obtaining user feedback and gaining a deeper understanding of the capability's use and effectiveness in operational environments.

The team successfully integrated the MPDS and TFP into Role 2 (forward support) and Role 2 Enhanced (stabilization) medical roles of care during BK25. Role 2 was supported by Charlie Medical Company of the 225 Logistics Support Brigade, 25th Infantry Division, while the Role 2E was supported by the 147th Field Hospital (FH). Combined Joint medical teams provided critical user feedback on the performance and usability of the MPDS and TFP and its impact on diagnostic capabilities.

The TFP consistently outperformed traditional diagnostic methods, offering faster and more precise diagnoses, according to Rooney. Its ease of use and portability were also highlighted, making it suitable for deployment in diverse settings ranging from established field hospitals to austere, remote clinics.

Over the course of the exercise, participating units successfully performed nearly 100 TFP tests across three devices for 10 consecutive days. Users submitted over 85 surveys containing invaluable user feedback. The operational environments observed at the Role 2 and Role 2E sites at Fort Roman Magsaysay, the largest military reservation in the Philippines, accurately mirrored potential deployed situations in tropical and subtropical environments, including exposure to rain, extreme heat, high humidity, and dust. Despite these challenges, no safety concerns were observed related to the MPDS device or TFP testing, and the devices remained operational.

Prior to integration into the BK25 exercise, the OPMED team conducted initial training for the Bridge Support Medical Company at Schofield Barracks in Hawaii in January 2025. According to Rooney, these training efforts were aimed at enhancing user familiarity with the operational capabilities of the MPDS, particularly focusing on diagnostic procedures for tropical fevers.

""The initial training in Hawaii proved invaluable,"" she said. ""The 25th ID was able to quickly initiate operations and testing during BK25. When a technical issue arose, we were able to work with the vendor to identify and implement a solution within 24 hours.""

Role 2E FH units received onsite training at Fort Ramon Magsaysay at the start of BK25 experimentation. Following the initial setup, the team focused on providing hands-on instruction, from system setup to running controls and patient samples.

To gather comprehensive feedback, surveys set up by the 18th TMC and Medical Capability Development and Integration Directorate, in collaboration with the OPMED team, were distributed to units at Role 2 and Role 2E sites, enabling real-time data collection on the functionality and operation of the MPDS and TFP capabilities. That feedback will be instrumental in further refining and improving the DHA RHD program and its contribution to ensuring the health and well-being of military personnel in diverse operational environments, according to Gupta.

""Our team’s presence in the field was critical,"" she said. ""Without it, the integration would not have been as successful. The 18th TMC's Experimentation Team has a broad focus, and we were able to provide the dedicated support needed for this specific capability.""

Beyond training and integration, the OPMED team also engaged with other units and stakeholders participating in BK25, including Australian and Filipino forces. Rooney and Gupta briefed the United States Army Pacific Concepts team, demonstrating the capability and answering questions regarding its intended use. This led to discussions about increased integration into future exercises with expanded functionality. Other medical personnel, including representatives from Air Force Special Forces and the Navy, expressed interest in the MPDS for various applications.

Development of this far forward rapid diagnostics capability is a collaborative effort involving multiple DoD and commercial partners, according to Rooney. OPMED manages the development of the TFP, while the Joint Program Executive Office for Chemical, Biological, Radiological, and Nuclear Defense leads the development of the MPDS. Both leverage technology developed by Cepheid, Inc.

Information gathered from the BK25 event is crucial for refining the MPDS capability, optimizing its integration into future joint exercises, and supporting fielding in operational environments, according to Rooney. This user-centric feedback will drive ongoing development efforts, ensuring the MPDS and TFP meet the evolving needs of medical personnel in the field.

But you said nothing about regular VA healthcare. If a non-career veteran is eligible for VA healthcare, couldn’t that be used in place of Medicare? Signed: Veteran Advocate

Dear Veteran Advocate: Thank you for your feedback. FYI, I have previously explained that veterans who rely on the VA for 100% of their healthcare can, indeed, disenroll from Medicare Part B (thus saving the monthly Part B premium). I don’t personally recommend it because of my personal experience, but it certainly is possible to do so.

Personally, I use the VA for some of my healthcare needs – usually an annual checkup and optometry services – at my local VA clinic which is only a mile away from where I live. But for any extensive treatment needs (medical tests, etc.) I must travel about 40 miles to the nearest VA hospital facility. For contrast, I have numerous private healthcare services, specialists, and hospitals very near where I live, but to use them under the VA I must get VA preapproval and use only certain VA-approved providers, which is inconvenient for me. Personally, I prefer the freedom to go to any healthcare service provider I choose, without restriction, at any time I need to. So, I use my VA coverage when it is convenient for me but rely also on non-VA, Medicare-approved specialists who I can choose to use (or not) at will. For me, it’s a matter of convenience and the freedom to use whichever healthcare provider I want. That said, I fully understand that some veterans rely exclusively on the VA for their healthcare needs, and I have explained to many who have written to me that they have that option. I have also published several public articles about this as well. Here is one such article:

So, please rest assured that we regularly advise our veterans about their healthcare options under Medicare, including the ability to decline Medicare Part B coverage if they have full VA healthcare coverage. FYI, free Medicare Part A (inpatient hospitalization coverage) is mandatory to collect Social Security after age 65, but Medicare Part B coverage is always optional because there is a premium associated with Part B. A veteran can decline Medicare Part B coverage and save that monthly premium, but they would need to contact Social Security to do so. Social Security will want to interview the veteran to ensure they are aware of the potential financial consequences of not having Medicare Part B. And they may need to file form CMS-1763 (Request for Termination) But a non-career veteran can opt out of Medicare Part B if they get all of their healthcare services through the Veterans Administration.",https://static-asset.amac.us/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/02095948/Ask-Rusty-0423.jpg,N,0.0,2025-06-16 11:56:29.245233

Providers and beneficiaries can refer to the TRICARE Formulary Search Tool for information on tiered copay status and other requirements, including pre-authorization or quantity limits.
To alleviate beneficiary confusion and comments regarding TRICARE Formulary Change Beneficiary letters, the DHA created five letter templates for pre-authorization, step therapy, non-formulary, non-covered and OTC removal changes.
The beneficiaries are also provided with the link to the TRICARE Formulary Search Tool that provides more information on TRICARE covered drugs, including any restrictions and which provides any applicable pre-authorization forms.","The National Defense Authorization Act required the establishment of a Pharmacy & Therapeutics committee (P&T) for fiscal year 2000. Its purpose was to develop and maintain a Uniform Formulary of medications—a list of brand name and generic drugs and supplies that TRICARE covers—which provides pharmacy benefits in the outpatient setting.

The Department of Defense Pharmacy & Therapeutics committee meetings are held quarterly, with recommendations determining which medications are included on the Uniform Formulary based on clinical and cost-effectiveness of the agents. The DOD P&T committee recommendations are then discussed publicly with the Beneficiary Advisory Panel.

The Beneficiary Advisory Panel is comprised of nongovernmental organizations representing DOD beneficiaries, pharmacy contractors and TRICARE network providers. Federal law requires that the BAP review and comment on the DOD P&T committee recommendations for implementing formulary changes to Tier 3 status, pre-authorization criteria, and implementation periods. The BAP is unique in that it gives beneficiaries a voice about what medications are included on the formulary, while providing transparency to what is often an unpublicized process in other health systems. Following the BAP comments, the final formulary decisions are reviewed and signed by the director of the Defense Health Agency.

Beginning in October 2007, the DOD took measures to improve communication with beneficiaries concerning formulary changes. Among the new measures, patient-specific notification letters were mailed to beneficiaries impacted by a variety of formulary changes. Examples include an increase in the cost-share (Tier 3 status), and a change from a preferred to a non-preferred status, which can include, but is not limited to, new step therapy or pre-authorization requirements.

TRICARE added a limited number of OTC drugs to the formulary and made them available at all three points of service: military pharmacies, home delivery, and at retail network pharmacies. Additionally, a variety of OTC products are available only at military pharmacies. The DOD P&T committee reviews the OTC drug classes to determine which drugs should and should not be covered, and occasionally an OTC drug will be removed from the benefit, in which case affected beneficiaries are notified.

Working with several avenues for beneficiaries to submit questions and through different sources, including the pharmacy benefit manager contractor, DHA realized that individual letters describing the upcoming formulary changes required streamlining. The new individual letters describe the upcoming formulary change, lists options for formulary alternatives that the beneficiary and their doctor can consider, includes the associated copay information, and documents the implementation date for the associated change. The letters are mailed to impacted beneficiaries by the pharmacy contractor at least 30 days prior to the formulary change.

In 2018, the NDAA directed TRICARE to add a fourth “not covered” tier to its formulary, which excludes coverage of pharmaceutical agents that have little clinical effectiveness and aren’t cost effective. Similar to commercial pharmacy benefit plans, beneficiaries must pay the full out-of-pocket cost for these completely excluded drugs at retail network pharmacies and these agents aren’t available at military pharmacies or home delivery. The DOD P&T committee not only evaluates drugs for exclusion from coverage, but also identifies branded drugs that may be moved to Tier 1 (generic formulary) status with a lower copayment for beneficiaries. Providers and beneficiaries can refer to the TRICARE Formulary Search Tool for information on tiered copay status and other requirements, including pre-authorization or quantity limits.

To alleviate beneficiary confusion and comments regarding TRICARE Formulary Change Beneficiary letters, the DHA created five letter templates for pre-authorization, step therapy, non-formulary, non-covered and OTC removal changes. All new letters immediately begin with the date of change and impacted drug in bolded font so beneficiaries can easily know the important details up front. In addition, the letter outlines the reason for the formulary change. A separate letter is attached so that beneficiaries can share the information to review with their health care provider. The beneficiaries are also provided with the link to the TRICARE Formulary Search Tool that provides more information on TRICARE covered drugs, including any restrictions and which provides any applicable pre-authorization forms.

In 2019, in addition to mailing letters to beneficiaries 30 days prior to the formulary change implementation date, DHA also published letter templates on the beneficiary website so beneficiaries could access them directly. Posting the letters on the website helps alert beneficiaries of upcoming formulary changes and has also aided in reducing the level of confusion.",https://health.mil/-/media/Images/MHS/Photos/Default-MHS-Seal.png,N,0.0,2025-06-15 16:56:20.798222

Is it possible that it is being denied because the prescribing doctor isn't showing as an in-network provider? With all the issues with providers not getting transferred over to the West system, that could be an issue.

Your waiver should be good no matter where you are. I’ve been on a super expensive name brand for 19 years and recently moved from east to west and there were no issues. I called ahead of time to make sure, but Express Scripts said we were good. I would call Express Scripts and find out what’s going on. You may need to have your doctor send in a new waiver request.

One thing I have run into, though, are pharmacies who didn’t feel like doing prior authorization and told me my medication wasn’t covered when it was. (both CVS and Walgreens) Definitely call ES to find out what happened because it shouldn’t have changed.",,N,0.0,2025-06-15 06:56:28.032038
