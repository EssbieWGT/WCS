In other recent news, Zynex Inc. reported a net loss for the fourth quarter of 2024, missing analysts’ expectations.
Analysts from firms such as Ladenburg and RBC have shown interest in Zynex’s strategies to address these issues, particularly the TRICARE payment suspension.","On Wednesday, shares of Zynex Inc. (NASDAQ: ), currently trading near its 52-week low of $6.91, may face headwinds as RBC Capital Markets downgraded the medical technology company’s stock from Outperform to Sector Perform. The firm also slashed its price target to $5.50 from the previous $11.00. According to InvestingPro data, three analysts have recently revised their earnings estimates downward for the upcoming period. This decision comes after Zynex provided a less-than-optimistic update during its fourth-quarter earnings call, which raised concerns about the company’s visibility into its operations and future business performance.

Zynex disclosed a slower-than-usual receipt of payments from certain payers during the fourth quarter. Additionally, the company received a notification from Tricare, its largest payer, which accounts for 20-25% of Zynex’s sales exposure, about a temporary suspension of payments to review previous claims. Despite these challenges, the company maintains a strong financial position with a current ratio of 3.94 and an impressive gross margin of 79.7%. This news is particularly troubling for the company as it could significantly impact revenue streams.

In response to the uncertainties, Zynex has decided not to issue guidance for 2025. Furthermore, the company is planning to reduce its workforce by approximately 15% in an effort to align its cost base with the anticipated new revenue levels. These measures indicate that Zynex is entering a period of restructuring to stabilize its business.

The revised price target from RBC Capital reflects the potential risks associated with the loss of its largest payer. The analysts at RBC Capital expressed concerns about the possibility of a domino effect, where the issues with Tricare might lead to further complications with other payers, potentially exacerbating the company’s financial challenges.

Investors are likely to keep a close eye on Zynex’s next moves as it navigates through these operational headwinds. The company’s ability to manage its payer relationships and adjust its cost structure will be critical in determining its financial health and stock performance going forward. Notably, InvestingPro’s Fair Value analysis suggests the stock may be undervalued at current levels, despite the operational challenges.

In other recent news, Zynex Inc. reported a net loss for the fourth quarter of 2024, missing analysts’ expectations. The company recorded an earnings per share (EPS) of -$0.02, falling short of the projected $0.10, with revenue reported at $45.98 million, below the expected $53.3 million. This performance marks a decline in net revenue compared to the same quarter last year, where revenue stood at $47.3 million. Zynex’s financial outlook for the first quarter of 2025 anticipates revenue of $30 million and a projected net loss between $9 million and $10 million, partly due to a temporary TRICARE payment suspension affecting short-term guidance. Despite these challenges, the company maintains a strong gross profit margin of 78% and has increased its cash on the balance sheet by 5% from the previous quarter. The company is also focusing on diversifying into patient monitoring technologies, with anticipated revenue from this segment expected in late 2025 or 2026, pending FDA clearance of its new pulse oximeter. Analysts from firms such as Ladenburg and RBC have shown interest in Zynex’s strategies to address these issues, particularly the TRICARE payment suspension. The company remains optimistic about its long-term growth prospects, with CEO Thomas Sandgaard highlighting ongoing efforts to adapt to market changes and maintain investments in the business.

For Q1 2025, Zynex expects revenue of at least $30 million.

“We continue to be in-network and have maintained good relations with Tricare,” Sandgaard said.","Zynex Inc (NASDAQ:ZYXI) reported full-year revenue has grown 4% to reach $192.4 million in the 2024 financial year.

The medical technology company specializing in non-invasive devices for pain management, rehabilitation and patient monitoring saw 16% year-over-year growth in orders in 2024.

Net income for the year was $3 million or $0.09 per share, with cash flow from operations totaling $12.7 million.

Zynex CEO Thomas Sandgaard told shareholders that the firm is confident that its pain management business has ""significant growth potential"" in the long term, citing ongoing payer expansion efforts and progress with its NiCO laser pulse oximeter clinical trial, which produced positive results.

The NiCO pulse oximeter uses advanced laser technology to measure fractional blood oxygenation levels, offering greater accuracy than LED-based pulse oximeters, which have been found to misread oxygen levels in some populations, particularly individuals with darker skin tones.

""Over the long term we believe we will remain a leader of holistic, non-invasive approaches to pain management and patient monitoring and continue to pursue additional lines of revenue that improve patient outcomes and overall health,"" Sandgaard said in a statement.

For Q1 2025, Zynex expects revenue of at least $30 million.

Good relations with Tricare

For the fourth quarter of 2024, revenue was $46 million compared to $47.3 million in the year-ago quarter.

Zynex CEO Thomas Sandgaard attributed the shortfall to due to slower payments from some insurers and a temporary suspension of payments from Tricare, which represents 20% to 25% of Zynex's annual revenue.

“We continue to be in-network and have maintained good relations with Tricare,” Sandgaard said. “We have a meeting with Tricare in April and believe we have good evidence to get payments reinstated.”

To address this, Zynex is reducing staff by 15%, focusing on corporate roles, which along with other expense cuts is expected to save $35 million annually.

“Although these processes are never easy, it is critical for us to be prudent and conservative in adapting to external changes and execute these expense adjustments immediately,” Sandgaard said.",https://cdn.proactiveinvestors.com/eyJidWNrZXQiOiJwYS1jZG4iLCJrZXkiOiJ1cGxvYWRcL05ld3NcL0ltYWdlXC8yMDI1XzAzXC9TY3JlZW5zaG90LTIwMjMtMTAtMjMtYXQtMS0wMi0zOC1QTS5qcGciLCJlZGl0cyI6eyJyZXNpemUiOnsid2lkdGgiOjEyMDAsImhlaWdodCI6NjMwLCJmaXQiOiJjb3ZlciJ9fX0=,N,1.0,2025-03-12 00:50:24.966292

Full transcript - Zynex Inc (ZYXI) Q4 2024:

Conference Operator: Call. As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to Brian Preneveau, Investor Relations for Xynex.

Brian Preneveau, Investor Relations, Xynex: Thank you, operator, and good afternoon, everyone. Earlier today, Xynex released financial results for the fourth quarter and year ended 12/31/2024. A copy of the press release is available on the company’s website. Joining me today on the call are Thomas Sandgaard, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer Dan Moorhead, Chief Financial Officer Anna Luksoch, Chief Operating Officer and Donald Gregg, President of Xynex Monitoring Solutions. Before we begin, I’d like to remind you that during this conference call, the company will make projections and forward looking statements regarding future events.

We encourage you to review the company’s past and future filings with the SEC, including, without limitation, the company’s 2024 Form 10 K and subsequent Form 10 Qs, which identify the specific factors that may cause actual results or events to differ materially from those described in these forward looking statements. These factors may include, without limitation, statements regarding product development, product potential, the regulatory environment, sales and marketing strategies, capital resources or operating performance. With that, I’ll now turn the call over to Thomas.

Thomas Sandgaard, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer, Xynex: Thanks, Brian, and good afternoon, everyone. Thank you for joining us today for the fourth quarter and full year twenty twenty four earnings call. 2024 was a successful year for Cynex as we continue to grow revenue and drive profitability. We have made strides in diversifying our revenue streams with the addition of several new products, some internally developed and some manufactured and added private label products primarily in the areas of brazing, cold and compression products, all a perfect fit for our sales force’s call points in pain and rehab. We’ve also expanded the focus of our sales force to additional new prescribers of pain and rehab products such as national change of workers’ comp and the VA.

In a moment, Don Gregg will provide you with an update for our patient monitoring business and the FDA submission of our pulse oximeter. In late twenty twenty four, we received positive test results on our Neko pulse oximeter in multiple trials done at Duke University and at the University of California in San Francisco. Human trial completion is an essential step prior to our 05/10 submission to the FCA. The data from the trials have been excellent in showing how much lower bias the current LED base compared to how the current LED base for oximeters exhibit, especially for skin with darker pigmentation. The old LED technology leads to inaccurate or inconsistent readings during clinical or critical times for a patient, which has been widely criticized in the media and politically.

We believe that our laser based system is a superior technology and has the opportunity to meaningfully impact patient outcomes. I would like Don Gregg provide more details on the status momentarily. We were recently notified by TRICARE that they were temporarily suspending payments to Cynex related to a review of prior claims. We have a meeting with them here in early April to get it all sorted out, but cannot at this point provide an estimate on when it will all be resolved. Anna will provide more details to her during her discussion of operations.

Given that TRICARE is a substantial source of reimbursement revenue, we currently have limited visibility in our revenue projections for 2025. And we have taken the most conservative approach to not include revenue in the later part of 2024, where some of those bills were submitted to TRICARE yet not paid. And in this current quarter forecast and therefore the corresponding lower revenue numbers. As part of a normal prudent cost containment measure, due to the possibility of a significant decrease in revenue short term, while we accelerate sales to other sales channels, we continue to make adjustments to the corporate and sales cost structure to ensure we have optimized our structure and expense profile and are set to continue our long term growth and profitability. And again, Anna will cover this in more detail.

We remain very optimistic about the future of Cynex. The improvement we have made in analytics and operations over the past many years will show significant benefits in the long term. As we continue to diversify the product mix and revenue stream, we believe we can actually better capture the $800,000,000 of identified sales opportunities within our 800 designated sales territories. In the patient monitoring business, we had just before FDA submission and once cleared that should generate revenue in a very well established multibillion dollar sales segment. Over the past twenty nine years since its inception, our growth has certainly not been in a straight line as long term shareholders would certainly acknowledge and the key for us is to keep focused on the long vision of growth and diversification and stay firm regardless of short term disruptions.

We trust that shareholders are on board with this strategy. Our recent challenges in 2024 were not only introducing new product that so far have collected less than expected. However, we see clear signs of improvement here in early twenty twenty five. Our sales force and staff has been restructured and we have made changes to sales management. These improvements are already beginning to take effect and puts us in a good position to deal with the temporary suspension payment suspension from TiCare, while we focus on growing in other areas.

Fortunately, we are in an industry where our potential call points for our sales force is nearly endless. We are still confident that our non invasive approach with at home pain management devices have real growth opportunities to provide non opioid relief to patients. We remain focused on ramping our hospital monitoring division, which represents a large and growing market opportunity with a better mousetrap than our competitors in the pulse oximeter market. I’ll now turn the call over to Anna Logsock to provide a more detailed update on the operations and the status with the TRICARE. Anna?

Anna Luksoch, Chief Operating Officer, Xynex: Thank you, Thomas. As Thomas mentioned, we were notified by TRICARE of a temporary suspension of payments if they complete their review. From a reimbursement perspective, TRICARE is one of our largest insurers. We’re currently working through the reinstatement process and have a meeting with Defense Health Agency to present our appeal in early April, but worst case, it could take as long as twelve months to complete. TRICARE represents between 20% to 25% of our revenue, so this is a significant reduction in revenue if the suspension were to be upheld.

I think it is important to note a few things relative to this news. We completed an audit with TRICARE as recently as 2022. In this audit, we made all of the necessary adjustments to billing practices that were outlined and we haven’t heard anything further since that time. We have demonstrated that we fully comply with those adjustments and have a good cause for eventually continued business as usual with TRICARE. During this temporary suspension, we remain in network with TRICARE and are expected to continue processing new and existing claims for treatment for TRICARE patients.

In fact, TRICARE has said that they want current and new patients to continue receiving care through this process per hour contract. If or when the reimbursements begin again, TRICARE would be responsible for paying all of the claims that have been processed during that temporary hold, which would show significantly increased revenue once received. Moving on to operations, our organization and staff levels, which will decrease overall staff by 15% and primarily affects employees in our corporate office along with other expense reductions made during the second half of twenty twenty four and Q1 twenty twenty five will result in annual savings of approximately $35,000,000 This is a normal and good business practice that all companies constantly undergo. In 2024, trimmed the sales force to ensure we have the right reps in place to put us in the best position moving forward. As of December 31, we had a sales force of approximately three thirty people as compared to the beginning of twenty twenty four, where we had approximately four seventy five people.

Progress takes time, but we have seen positive trends. Revenue increased 4% in 2024 and order growth was 16% in the year. The total number of reps was down, but the revenue per rep increased 22% to $490,000 on average in 2024. I’ll now turn the call over to Don Gregg to provide a more detailed update on the patient monitoring business. Don?

Donald Gregg, President of Xynex Monitoring Solutions, Xynex: Thank you, Anna. I want to provide an update on the progress of our neko pulse oximeter. Although our FDA submission has been delayed into 2025, we are closing on major milestones to commercialize the neko pulse oximeter. Neko verification human trials completed in fourth quarter of twenty twenty four at Duke University with positive results as planned. Xynex’s neko pulse oximeter utilizes precise laser technology to measure blood oxygenation levels directly as opposed to current LED pulse oximeter products, which only estimate oxygenation levels.

LED pulse oximeters have been shown to miss measure oxygen levels in several populations most prominently in individuals with darker skin pigmentation. We presented a poster of our study from the University of California, San Francisco Hypoxia Lab at Anesthesiology twenty twenty four in the fourth quarter. Four nCo pulse oximeters and two different commercially available LED based pulse oximeters were used on each participant. Conclusions from the study showed the nCo pulse oximeter did not demonstrate a bias for dark pigmented participants compared to lightly pigmented participants. By comparison, conventional LED based pulse oximeters in the present study read falsely higher on darkly pigmented participants specifically at lower oxygen saturation levels.

There have been published studies starting in the 1980s that detail how these inaccuracies were associated with disparities in care. Completed human trials were one of the last major milestones to complete prior to the FDA five ten submission. In late twenty twenty four and into 2025, Nikos have been undergoing third party regulatory ISO testing for compliance to safety and electrical standards. At this point, we anticipate FDA submission in the next thirty to sixty days following that completion. Based on historical submissions, approval takes approximately six months, which would mean a potential fourth quarter twenty twenty five clearance barring any uncertainty of FDA review resources.

Also in December of twenty twenty four, we announced our membership in the Open Oximetry Project, a nonprofit oximetry partnership of research organizations and industries created to improve the safety and precision of pulse oximeters in all populations. Xynex is pushing to be a key industry partner to all clinicians and show how the Neko pulse oximeter technology inherently solves the current market challenges, especially skin pigmentation bias, while bringing new precision medicine forward in the field of pulse oximetry. In summary, we’ve achieved major milestones in Q4 of twenty twenty four on NECA commercial development, clinical verification and we are very close to FDA five ten submission. Patient monitoring is a multi billion dollar market that we believe we can enter with a superior product that can meaningfully improve care to a broad range of patients when they need it most. I will now turn the call over to Dan Morehead, Chief Financial Officer for a more in-depth look at the quarter’s financial performance.

Dan Moorhead, Chief Financial Officer, Xynex: Thanks, Don. Please refer to our press release issued earlier today for a summary of our financial results for the fourth quarter and year ended 12/31/2024. Net revenue was $46,000,000 compared to $47,300,000 in the fourth quarter of twenty twenty three. Device revenue was $14,800,000 compared to $16,300,000 in the fourth quarter of last year. Supplies revenue was $31,200,000 up from $31,000,000 in the fourth quarter of last year.

Device revenue was lower during the quarter due to some product mix shift to lower priced products such as braces and other products that have lower price points than the Next Wave devices. Gross profit in the fourth quarter was $36,000,000 or 78% of revenue as compared to $37,000,000 also 78% of revenue in 2023. Sales and marketing expenses were $19,300,000 in the fourth quarter of twenty twenty four compared to $21,700,000 in the same period in 2023. The primary contributor to the decrease in sales and marketing expenses was our headcount reduction of roughly 140 sales team members. G and A expenses were $17,300,000 in the fourth quarter of twenty twenty four compared to $13,000,000 last year largely due to ZMS increased expenses and professional fees.

Net loss was $615,000 or $0.02 per share in the fourth quarter of twenty twenty four compared to net income of $1,200,000 or $0.04 per share in Q4 of twenty twenty three. Adjusted EBITDA for the three months ended 12/31/2024 was $584,000 as compared to $9,900,000 in the quarter ended 12/31/2023. Cash flows from operations were $2,400,000 in Q4 and $12,700,000 for the full year. The cash flow in the quarter and year increased our cash on the balance sheet to $39,600,000 up 5% from Q3’s balance of $37,600,000 Working capital was $58,300,000 as of December 31. With that, I’ll now turn the call back over to Thomas.

Thomas Sandgaard, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer, Xynex: Yes. Thank you, Dan. The beginning of 2025 was certainly not as smooth as we had hoped, but we are optimistic about the long term prospects of the company and the opportunities we have going forward. That still has not changed. Because of the uncertainty surrounding payments here short term for TRICARE, we will not be providing full 2025 annual guidance yet, given the lack of visibility surrounding the temporary payments suspension.

We are obviously still in network with TRICARE and continue to accept new prescriptions for the instructions. When we learn more information throughout the year, we’ll be better able to communicate expectations and update everyone. At this stage, we anticipate the first quarter this year revenue of approximately $30,000,000 We will likely have a net loss in the first quarter ranging between $9,000,000 and $10,000,000 as a result of not all restructuring having taken effect yet. Throughout this year, we will look to make adjustments to the cost structures as needed. Fundamentally, with or without TRICARE as a payer, we still have a rock solid business that will continue to grow towards revenues of $800,000,000 plus in the pain management division.

Our diversification into the patient monitoring area is set to start adding revenue late this year and next year pending FDA clearance. We’re incredibly proud of the growth that we have consistently demonstrated over the past several years. Just ten years ago, our revenues were nearly 20 times lower than now. And in the meantime, we’ve been able to buy back over $80,000,000 worth of stock in the open market and we had a cash balance of $40,000,000 at the end of twenty twenty four. Well, ten years ago, we were scraping the bottom of our bank account daily to pay our bills.

Looking forward, we believe we have additional customers and revenue streams that can drive further growth. The business we have created and the profitability we are able to generate allows us to have a high degree of flexibility to allocate capital in several ways and deal with temporary difficult situations like this. We have shown the ability to adjust to market customer and reimbursement changes and continue to invest in our business and return cash to shareholders. With that, operator, please open the call up for questions.

Conference Operator: Your first question comes from the line of Jeffrey Cohen from Ladenburg. Please

Jeffrey Cohen, Analyst, Ladenburg: go. Hi. Thanks for taking our questions. Just a couple from our end. So when you talk about the stock reductions of 15 ish percent, could you give us a sense of what was accomplished in the fourth quarter?

And then also give us a sense of how that will affect your two OpEx lines, both the sales line and the G and A

Dan Moorhead, Chief Financial Officer, Xynex: Yes, I would say the we probably did if you’re looking at $30,000,000 plus in annual savings, I would say a little less than half of it was done during 2024, but you wouldn’t see all of it because obviously you’re looking at run rates and those types of things. So they were a lot of those were implemented in the second half and then the remaining pieces were done in Q1 with some of that coming late in Q1. So So, if you’re looking at sales expenses and those types of things, as far as run rate, Q4 sales, we just posted $19,300,000 I think that number is definitely coming down and that has been coming down for the past few quarters as you know. So it’s probably down $1,500,000 to $2,000,000 on the run rate going forward and then G and A you’re going to see the same thing down a couple of million dollars a quarter based on what we did in Q4. And those will actually continue to come down in Q2 a little bit as well.

Like I said, a lot of those changes were put in at the end or middle to end of Q1.

Jeffrey Cohen, Analyst, Ladenburg: Yes. So I guess the M30 on an annual basis for 2025, does it hit both the sales and marketing as well as the G and A the same percentage or is it going to be more heavily weighted on the sales and marketing one?

Dan Moorhead, Chief Financial Officer, Xynex: No, it’d be more on the G and A because the G and A is a smaller number too. So it’s going to be a bigger number out of this smaller number. Sales was already decreasing based on the trimming that Anna talked about and those types of things. So I think as a percentage, it’s going to be more on the G and A line, but both are going to be decreasing by, like I said, run rate, you’re looking at close to $2,000,000 compared to what we did in Q4.

Jeffrey Cohen, Analyst, Ladenburg: Got it. Okay. And then secondly, maybe for Thomas or for Don, could you hypothesize with us a little bit about NYCOX and the commercial path to market that you’re anticipating? Are you hypothesizing going direct yourselves with a commercial organization? Are you hypothesizing partners or different setups for different channels?

Donald Gregg, President of Xynex Monitoring Solutions, Xynex: So this is Don. We have a strategy that actually leverages all three of those. As you look at penetrating the market as we would get clearance and potentially in Q4, twenty twenty six certainly would be the year of ramp for that. We have been in discussions with potential partners, not just distribution partners, but partners that would potentially take the device and put it in their sales bag. We have had discussions through what it would look like as part of a direct sales force, where we would start with particular hospitals and IDNs.

And then third of all, we have looked at an indirect sales force of potential ten ninety nine of organizations that sell both capital and disposable equipment in this. And so we’re poised to be ready to pull the trigger when we have clearance and covered the entire plan with Thomas and our executive leaders.

Jeffrey Cohen, Analyst, Ladenburg: Okay, perfect. That does it for us. Thanks for taking our questions.

Conference Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Shagun Singh from RBC. Your line is now open.

Shagun Singh, Analyst, RBC: Hey, good afternoon. This is Avi on for Shidoon. I have a few questions. First, what was the nature of the 2022 audit by TRICARE related to billing practice practices? And I guess why didn’t you have any visibility to TRICARE ahead of time before this happened?

Anna Luksoch, Chief Operating Officer, Xynex: So the nature of the audit was a routine post payment audit. It’s very common from most insurance companies. And the type of adjustments that were suggested during the audit were also fairly standard. So nothing major was identified or adjusted.

Shagun Singh, Analyst, RBC: Okay. Could you I guess that’s helpful. Why don’t you have you only gave Q1 sales guidance, not 2025 obviously, but like why don’t you have the visibility into sales? You have still 75% of your business or so that is being reimbursed. Could there be a domino effect?

What conversations are you having with other payers?

Thomas Sandgaard, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer, Xynex: No, there’s really no connection here. This is totally isolated. We do obviously internally have some numbers that are if TRICARE end up never paying us anything or if they don’t start picking up payments until the end of the year, we’re pretty confident that at some point throughout the year, they will eventually get through this conversation with them and basically prove that, hey, we did everything you asked for, what’s your problem. It’s been very unclear exactly what it is that they’re looking for. So and because TRICARE is such a big part of our revenue, we obviously the difference in the guidance we will give is many tens of millions dollars, if not more than $50,000,000 right?

So therefore, we’d like to

Jeffrey Cohen, Analyst, Ladenburg: have a

Thomas Sandgaard, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer, Xynex: little more clarity into our dialogue with TRICARE before we get to revenue guidance. What we are doing is to make sure in a worst case scenario, let’s keep doing what we always should be doing, make sure we trim expenses and restructure the organization to be able to handle even worst case scenarios.

Shagun Singh, Analyst, RBC: Great. And the last question is, what’s your plan like to present at this April meeting with TRICARE? Have they told you any details on what they are they requesting anything? Or do you have, I guess, data to show them to whatever to help them figure it out, whatever it is that they exactly need from you?

Anna Luksoch, Chief Operating Officer, Xynex: Yes. They gave us some big guidance on what they’re looking for. It’s still very unclear what exactly their problem is, but we have lots of data to present to them on specifically regarding policies that we’re following. We will be referring back to the 2022 audit and the findings of that audit and adjustments. There were some directions we received during the audit that we’ll be highlighting in that presentation.

So that’s mainly going to be our focus.

Shagun Singh, Analyst, RBC: Thank you.

Conference Operator: Your last question comes from the line of Yi Chen from H. C. Wainwright. Please go ahead.

Yi Chen, Analyst, H.C. Wainwright: Hi. Thank you for taking my questions. Could you comment on what specific factors that triggered TRICARE to start reviewing your prior claims. And is it a typical practice that during the review process payers would temporarily suspend payments?

Anna Luksoch, Chief Operating Officer, Xynex: We’re unclear on specific triggers at this point because they haven’t communicated clearly what the issue is. As far as these type of reviews, I mean post payment reviews among payers are very common. We undergo multiple audits or post payment reviews from several different payers on a monthly basis. Payment suspension is somewhat common. It’s not the usual practice, but it happens with other payers as well.

Yi Chen, Analyst, H.C. Wainwright: So are you worried that the other payers could potentially follow TRICU and start reviewing claims and suspend payments to you?

Thomas Sandgaard, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer, Xynex: We don’t see any connection. I mean, it’s across the board. We deal with 3,000 insurance companies every all the time and these things happen with small insurance companies, large insurance carriers. TRICARE is a big one, obviously. So therefore, we have taken this very conservative approach, but these guys all operate very independently.

There’s really no connection. And this is a government payer. It’s not in the private sector. So there’s already there, but a bit big disconnect.

Yi Chen, Analyst, H.C. Wainwright: And just trying to clarify, did you mention that this kind of process could potentially take up to twelve months to resolve?

Shagun Singh, Analyst, RBC: What does the letter say?

Anna Luksoch, Chief Operating Officer, Xynex: Yes. The letter from Defense Health Agency stated this is a temporary payment suspension and it could be up to twelve months. But we are given an opportunity to present an appeal within thirty days, which we have a meeting scheduled in the April. And we’ll know more after that meeting.

Thomas Sandgaard, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer, Xynex: And yet to have the nerve to demand that we still treat and send supplies to existing patients and keep accepting new patients and treat them 100% like we always have except the from Sendus payment in the meantime. Not very nice, but that’s the reality at least for now.

Yi Chen, Analyst, H.C. Wainwright: Does the claims made to TRICARE cover a specific territories in the country or it’s across the country?

Anna Luksoch, Chief Operating Officer, Xynex: They’re national, they’re across the country?

Thomas Sandgaard, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer, Xynex: Yes. Actually one of their letters, Amber, had an interesting statement in it that we were one of their very valued providers and they really appreciate working with us. Obviously, we provide opioid free pain management to TRICARE patients. That’s obviously a pretty big deal for what we do for all those patients.

Yi Chen, Analyst, H.C. Wainwright: Great. Thank you for taking my question.

Conference Operator: There are no further questions at this time. I’d like to turn the call over to Thomas Sandgaard for closing remarks. Sir, please go ahead.

Thomas Sandgaard, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer, Xynex: Yes. Thank you for joining us today. Although disappointing, we’re still overall long term pleased with our performance and where things are headed. And last year, obviously, we ended up with a decent financial result and the consistent growth that our team is delivering. We look forward to leveraging our momentum and the changes we are making to the organization and the direction of our sales force throughout 2025.

And we look forward to speaking to you at upcoming investor events. Appreciate your time and interest in Cynex. Have a great day.

Zynex Inc., a leading provider of electrotherapy and rehabilitation products, has released its 2024 10-K report, detailing the company's financial performance, business operations, strategic initiatives, and the challenges it faces. The report provides a comprehensive overview of Zynex's efforts to expand its market presence, develop new products, and manage operational risks in a competitive industry.

Financial Highlights

Total net revenue: $192.4 million, reflecting a 4% increase from the previous year driven by a 16% growth in device orders.

Income from operations: $6.0 million, a decrease from $10.8 million in the prior year, primarily due to increased general and administrative expenses.

Net income: $3.0 million, down from $9.7 million in 2023, impacted by higher operating expenses and interest expense.

Net income per share: $0.09, compared to $0.27 in the previous year, reflecting the decrease in net income.

Cash flows from operating activities: $12.7 million, a decrease of 28% from the prior year, attributed to lower profitability and changes in working capital.

Business Highlights

Revenue Segments: Zynex Medical, Inc. (ZMI) accounts for substantially all of the company's revenue, primarily from electrotherapy products and private labeled rehabilitation products. The primary product is the NexWave device, which requires consumable supplies like electrodes and batteries.

Sales Units: The company achieved a 16% increase in device orders in 2024, indicating strong demand for its electrotherapy products.

New Product Launches: In 2024, ZMI launched the M-Wave, a user-friendly NMES device designed for muscle stimulation and re-education, which was cleared by the FDA in February 2024.

New Product Development: Zynex Monitoring Solutions (ZMS) is developing the NiCO™ CO-Oximeter and HemeOx™ Total Hemoglobin Oximeter, which are laser-based and designed to address inaccuracies in traditional pulse oximeters. NiCO is anticipated to be submitted to the FDA for clearance in Q1 2025.

Future Outlook: The company is focused on expanding its sales force to address the untapped market for electrotherapy products and pain management, with a goal of increasing performance management standards for its sales force.

Operational Adjustments: Due to a temporary payment suspension by TriCare, which represents 20-25% of annual revenue, the company is restructuring its staff, reducing overall staff by approximately 10% to align with current revenue.

Research and Development: The company incurred approximately $12.0 million in operating expenses related to ZMS operations in 2024, with a focus on developing new monitoring solutions.

Human Capital: As of December 31, 2024, Zynex employed approximately 1,000 full-time employees, emphasizing competitive pay, benefits, and training programs to attract and retain talent.

Strategic Initiatives

Strategic Initiatives: The company has focused on expanding its business through the issuance of $52.5 million in Convertible Senior Notes, with an additional $7.5 million issued upon the exercise of an over-allotment option. This capital is intended to support business expansion and operational growth. The company also completed multiple IRB-approved clinical studies and a hypoxemia study, indicating a strategic focus on research and development in the medical device sector.

Capital Management: The company repurchased approximately $15.6 million worth of its common stock as part of a $20 million repurchase program authorized by the board. This program is intended to enhance shareholder value and is set to continue through March 2025 or until the full amount is repurchased. The company maintains a strong liquidity position with $39.6 million in cash and cash equivalents and a working capital of $58.3 million. The company has also managed its debt effectively, with interest on the Convertible Senior Notes payable semiannually.

Future Outlook: The company plans to continue its strategic focus on expanding its business and maintaining a strong liquidity position. It anticipates using cash to fund business expansion and has planned capital expenditures of approximately $1.5 million during 2025. The company is also confident in its long-term growth potential in the pain management business, despite current challenges with TriCare payment suspensions.

Challenges and Risks

Economic and Market Risks: Unfavorable global economic conditions, including military conflicts and pandemics, could adversely affect the company's business and financial condition. Rapid technological changes could render the company's products obsolete if it fails to enhance its offerings.

Operational Risks: The company is dependent on third-party payers for reimbursement, and changes in insurance reimbursement policies could decrease revenues. The reliance on sole suppliers for certain components and potential disruptions in the supply chain, especially for semiconductor chips, pose significant risks.

Regulatory Risks: Compliance with healthcare laws and regulations, including the Anti-Kickback Statute and the False Claims Act, is critical. Failure to comply could result in substantial penalties. The company also faces risks related to maintaining regulatory clearances for its products.

Cybersecurity Risks: The company is vulnerable to cyber-attacks and security breaches, which could lead to reduced revenue, increased costs, and damage to its reputation.

Financial Risks: The conversion feature of convertible senior notes may adversely affect the company's financial condition. Changes in financial accounting standards could also impact reported results.

Management's Commitment: Management is committed to addressing the identified material weaknesses in internal controls over financial reporting. The company is developing and implementing remediation plans to strengthen its internal controls and ensure accurate financial reporting.

Market Risks: Zynex, Inc. is exposed to market risks, including fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, which may adversely affect its financial results. The company is also subject to risks related to changes in interest rates, which could impact its financial condition and results of operations.

“We continue to be in-network and have maintained good relations with Tricare,” Sandgaard said.","Zynex Inc (NASDAQ:ZYXI) reported full-year revenue has grown 4% to reach $192.4 million in the 2024 financial year.

The medical technology company specializing in non-invasive devices for pain management, rehabilitation and patient monitoring saw 16% year-over-year growth in orders in 2024.

Net income for the year was $3 million or $0.09 per share, with cash flow from operations totaling $12.7 million.

Zynex CEO Thomas Sandgaard told shareholders that the firm is confident that its pain management business has ""significant growth potential"" in the long term, citing ongoing payer expansion efforts and progress with its NiCO laser pulse oximeter clinical trial, which produced positive results.

The NiCO pulse oximeter uses advanced laser technology to measure fractional blood oxygenation levels, offering greater accuracy than LED-based pulse oximeters, which have been found to misread oxygen levels in some populations, particularly individuals with darker skin tones.

""Over the long term we believe we will remain a leader of holistic, non-invasive approaches to pain management and patient monitoring and continue to pursue additional lines of revenue that improve patient outcomes and overall health,"" Sandgaard said in a statement.

For Q1 2025, Zynex expects revenue of at least $30 million.

Good relations with Tricare

For the fourth quarter of 2024, revenue was $46 million compared to $47.3 million in the year-ago quarter.

Zynex CEO Thomas Sandgaard attributed the shortfall to due to slower payments from some insurers and a temporary suspension of payments from Tricare, which represents 20% to 25% of Zynex's annual revenue.

“We continue to be in-network and have maintained good relations with Tricare,” Sandgaard said. “We have a meeting with Tricare in April and believe we have good evidence to get payments reinstated.”

To address this, Zynex is reducing staff by 15%, focusing on corporate roles, which along with other expense cuts is expected to save $35 million annually.

“Although these processes are never easy, it is critical for us to be prudent and conservative in adapting to external changes and execute these expense adjustments immediately,” Sandgaard said.",https://cdn.proactiveinvestors.com/eyJidWNrZXQiOiJwYS1jZG4iLCJrZXkiOiJ1cGxvYWRcL05ld3NcL0ltYWdlXC8yMDI1XzAzXC9TY3JlZW5zaG90LTIwMjMtMTAtMjMtYXQtMS0wMi0zOC1QTS5qcGciLCJlZGl0cyI6eyJyZXNpemUiOnsid2lkdGgiOjEyMDAsImhlaWdodCI6NjMwLCJmaXQiOiJjb3ZlciJ9fX0=,N,1.0,2025-03-11 17:50:27.626721

Management Commentary

""In the fourth quarter of 2024 we continued our steady growth in orders and delivered another year of revenue growth and profitability,"" said Thomas Sandgaard, President and CEO of Zynex. ""We generated $12.7 million of positive cash flow from operations and $10.9 million of Adjusted EBITDA in 2024.

""Our fourth quarter revenue was less than expected. The shortfall was due to slower than normal payments from certain payers and we were recently notified that Tricare has temporarily suspended payments as they review prior claims. We continue to be in-network and have maintained good relations with Tricare. We have a meeting with Tricare in April and believe we have good evidence to get payments reinstated. TriCare currently represents approximately 20-25% of our annual revenue. As directed by Tricare, we continue to support both existing patients and new patients as we receive their prescriptions.

""Due to the temporary payment suspension and lack of clarity on the timing of a resolution, we are restructuring our staff to align with current revenue. We are decreasing our overall staff by approximately 15%, which primarily affects employees in our corporate departments. This staff reduction along with other expense reductions made during the second half of 2024 and the first quarter of 2025 will result in savings of approximately $35 million annually. Although these processes are never easy, it is critical for us to be prudent and conservative in adapting to external changes and execute these expense adjustments immediately. We are confident that long-term, our pain management business is still solid with significant growth potential.

""We continue to accelerate our payer expansion and expect it to offset some of the near-term revenue challenges. Building relationships with new payers is a process, but we have been working on expansion in several areas during 2024 and expect those to start yielding results in 2025.

""Additionally, we completed the NiCO laser pulse oximeter human clinical trial at Duke University with positive results. The NiCO pulse oximeter utilizes highly precise laser technology to measure fractional blood oxygenation levels, compared to LED-based pulse oximeter products which have been shown to incorrectly estimate oxygen levels in several populations, most prominently in individuals with darker skin pigmentation.

""We maintain a flexible and healthy balance sheet and it's important to note over the past few years we have been able to buy back over $80 million worth of shares on the open market, directly increasing shareholder value.

""Over the long term we believe we will remain a leader of holistic, non-invasive approaches to pain management and patient monitoring and continue to pursue additional lines of revenue that improve patient outcomes and overall health,"" concluded Sandgaard.

Soldiers, family members and dedicated members of the Army community gathered to support a program that has, since 1942, supported the Army based on the premise of Soldiers helping Soldiers.

AER’s mission is to promote financial readiness and help Soldiers and Family members in times of need by providing grants, interest free loans and scholarships.

Just a few of the ways AER can help include:

Housing — utility and rent deposits, mortgages, small home repairs and more.

Personal vehicles — repairs, rental vehicles and car seats.

Medical — dental and medical expenses not covered by TRICARE, children’s cranial helmets and more.

AER also offers a Quick Assist Program that allows the chain of command to provide immediate assistance. A company commander or first sergeant can approve loans up to $2,000.

Those eligible include:

• Active-duty retired and medically retired Soldiers and their eligible dependents.

•Army Reserve and National Guard Soldiers on active duty for more than 30 consecutive days and their eligible dependents.

•Army Reserve and National Guard Soldiers who are retiring and receiving DFAS retired pay and their eligible dependents.

•Surviving spouses and children of Soldiers who died on active duty or as retirees.

AER has provided more than 2 billion in assistance since 1942.

Many of those in attendance raised their hands when asked if they had been helped by AER.

Spc. Luther Blount, one of the Soldiers who has benefitted from AER assistance, said the program helped him with his chosen career training.

“There were costs and unexpected challenges associated with that training. Thanks to an AER grant, I was able to cover those expenses. This allowed me to focus on my traing and gain the knowledge and experience I needed to succeed in my career,” Blount said. “It gave me peace of mind that I was able to take full advantage of these career opportunities. I want to express my deepest gratitude to AER.

Blount also encouraged his fellow Soldiers to explore these resources.

As a private and a recently divorced single mom trying to make ends meet, Staff Sgt Jessica Lattimore also received help from the AER program.

“AER gave me a loan that helped me reset some of my payments and spread them out enough that I was able to survive for the whole month and have my boys still be comfortable,” Lattimore said. “Because of AER and being able to reset my finances, I was able to continue on in the Army. I’m a staff sergeant now and I love my job.”

Col. Mark Andres, acting commanding officer of JRTC and Fort Johnson, said AER helps Army Soldiers in need based on the generosity of other Soldiers.

Andres said Fort Johnson didn’t do too well last year because we didn’t meet the installation’s goal.

“Last year at Fort Johnson, AER helped 247 active-duty service members and their families to just shy of $240 thousand, but our active-duty contributions to AER were only half of the $78 thousand total,” he said.

Andreas challenged Soldiers to do better this year.

“I think that we, as active-duty military, can contribute our heart. The potential for us to help each other is huge,” he said.

As the breakfast ended, Soldiers began filling out their contribution cards.

2017 Ford F-350 King Ranch: More Than Just a Truck My Ford F-350 King Ranch has been more than just a vehicle; it’s been a faithful companion, a powerful workhorse, and a luxury cruiser all rolled into one.","When I first saw that gleaming 2017 Ford F-350 King Ranch, I knew my life was about to change. As a long-time truck enthusiast, I’d always dreamed of owning a vehicle that combined raw power with unparalleled luxury. Little did I know that this used Super Duty would exceed my wildest expectations and become an integral part of my daily life and adventures.

The Decision

I’d been searching for a robust, reliable truck for months. My work often requires hauling heavy equipment, and I wanted something that could handle tough jobs while still being comfortable for long drives. When I stumbled upon this used 2017 F-350 King Ranch, it was love at first sight. The rich, bronze fire metallic paint gleamed in the sunlight, and the unmistakable King Ranch badging promised a level of sophistication I’d only dreamed of.

First Impressions

Sliding into the driver’s seat for the first time, I was immediately struck by the luxurious interior. The Mesa Brown leather seats, embossed with the King Ranch logo, were as comfortable as they were stylish. The expansive dashboard, with its mix of high-tech displays and classic styling, made me feel like I was piloting a private jet rather than a pickup truck.

But it wasn’t until I fired up the engine that I truly understood what I’d gotten myself into. The 6.7-liter Power Stroke V8 turbo diesel engine roared to life, its 440 horsepower and staggering 925 lb-ft of torque promising performance that would make light work of any task I could throw at it.

Capabilities That Astound

One of the first things I did with my new truck was to put its towing capabilities to the test. With a maximum towing capacity of up to 9,525 kg when properly equipped, I knew it could handle just about anything. I hooked up a large horse trailer, loaded with two horses and all their gear, and set off for a weekend camping trip in the mountains.

The F-350 didn’t just pull the trailer; it made the entire journey feel effortless. The integrated trailer brake controller and trailer sway control gave me confidence on winding mountain roads, while the truck’s powerful engine meant I barely noticed the extra weight, even on steep inclines.

Off-Road Adventures

While the F-350 King Ranch is undoubtedly luxurious, it’s far from being just a pretty face. I’ve taken it on several off-road adventures, and it’s never failed to impress. The 4×4 system, coupled with the electronic-locking rear differential, allows this beast to easily navigate challenging terrain.

One memorable trip took me deep into a remote forest, where the trails were muddy and riddled with obstacles. The truck’s impressive ground clearance (about 203 mm) meant I could clear fallen branches and rocks without worry. The hill descent control came in handy on steep declines, allowing me to focus on steering while the truck managed its speed automatically.

Daily Driving Comfort

What’s truly remarkable about the F-350 King Ranch is how it manages to be both a workhorse and a comfortable daily driver. Despite its size (measuring about 6.3 meters in length), it’s surprisingly manageable in urban environments. The adaptive steering system adjusts the steering ratio based on speed, making low-speed maneuvers in tight spaces much easier than you’d expect from a truck this size.

The interior is a cocoon of comfort and technology. The SYNC 3 infotainment system, with its responsive 8-inch touchscreen, keeps me connected and entertained on long drives. The premium Sony audio system turns the spacious cabin into a concert hall on wheels, perfect for those solo road trips or when I’m hauling the family to our favorite camping spots.

Fuel Efficiency: A Pleasant Surprise

Given the size and power of the F-350, I was ready for it to be a gas guzzler. However, I’ve been pleasantly surprised by its fuel efficiency, especially on long highway drives. While it’s not going to win any eco-awards, the advanced diesel engine technology means I can often achieve around 14 liters per 100 km on the highway, which is impressive for a truck of this capability.

Hauling and Payload

The bed of the F-350 has become my mobile workshop. With a payload capacity of up to 3,461 kg, I’ve used it to haul everything from construction materials for home renovation projects to a full load of firewood for winter. The spray-in bedliner has proven invaluable, protecting the bed from scratches and dents while keeping cargo from sliding around.

One particularly memorable project involved transporting a vintage motorcycle I was restoring. The truck’s bed, measuring about 2 meters in length (on the short bed model), easily accommodated the bike and all my tools and spare parts. The LED box lighting came in handy when I had to unload in the evening, providing ample illumination without draining the battery.

Technology That Impresses

The 2017 model year brought significant technological advancements to the F-350 lineup, and the King Ranch trim takes full advantage of these features. The 360-degree camera system has been a game-changer for parking and maneuvering in tight spaces. It’s also incredibly useful when hitching trailers, allowing me to align the hitch perfectly on the first try every time.

The adaptive cruise control is another feature I’ve come to rely on during long highway drives. It maintains a set distance from the vehicle ahead, automatically adjusting speed as needed. This, combined with the lane-keeping assist system, makes long journeys much less fatiguing.

Winter Performance

Living in an area with harsh winters, I was eager to see how the F-350 would handle snowy and icy conditions. I’m happy to report that it’s been nothing short of exceptional. The 4×4 system and the truck’s substantial weight provide excellent traction in slippery conditions. The heated seats and steering wheel have been a godsend on cold mornings, quickly taking the chill out of the air.

I’ve even used the truck to help pull out several stranded vehicles during particularly heavy snowfalls. The class-exclusive live-drive power takeoff provision has allowed me to operate a snow plow, turning my F-350 into a neighborhood hero during major storms.

A Mobile Office

As someone who often needs to work on the go, I’ve found the F-350 King Ranch an excellent mobile office. The spacious center console easily accommodates my laptop, while the multiple USB ports and 110V/400W outlet keep all my devices charged. The quiet cabin, aided by sound-deadening materials and the noise-reducing properties of the diesel engine, allows me to take calls and participate in video conferences without any background noise issues.

Adventures with Friends and Family

Perhaps the most joy I’ve gotten from my F-350 has been sharing it with friends and family. The Crew Cab configuration means plenty of room for passengers, with the rear seats offering a generous 1,107 mm of legroom. I’ve taken groups of friends on fishing trips, with plenty of space in the bed for all our gear and coolers.

The smooth ride and comfortable interior mean even long journeys are enjoyable. The kids love the spacious back seat, and the dual-zone climate control ensures everyone stays comfortable, regardless of personal temperature preferences.

Maintenance and Reliability

Owning a used vehicle always comes with some concerns about reliability, but my 2017 F-350 has been rock solid. I’ve stayed on top of regular maintenance, and the truck has rewarded me with consistent, trouble-free performance. The diesel engine, known for its longevity, shows no signs of slowing down even with the kilometers I’ve put on it.

2017 Ford F-350 King Ranch: More Than Just a Truck

My Ford F-350 King Ranch has been more than just a vehicle; it’s been a faithful companion, a powerful workhorse, and a luxury cruiser all rolled into one. It’s expanded what I thought was possible with a pickup truck, enabling me to take on projects and adventures I never would have considered before.

This truck has done everything from hauling heavy loads and conquering off-road trails to comfortable daily driving and family road trips. It’s been equally at home on muddy construction sites and valet parking at upscale restaurants. The combination of raw power, advanced technology, and luxurious comfort impresses me every time I get behind the wheel.

Owning this F-350 King Ranch has not just met my needs; it’s inspired me to dream bigger, to take on more challenging projects, and to explore further off the beaten path. It’s more than lived up to the Ford “Built Tough” slogan, proving itself a reliable partner in both work and play. As I look back on all the memories I’ve made and adventures I’ve had with this truck, I can say with certainty that choosing this 2017 Ford F-350 King Ranch was one of the best decisions I’ve ever made.",https://highburyford.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/2017_Ford_F-350_King_Ranch.jpg,N,0.0,2025-03-11 17:50:52.312347

In his opening statement, Chairman Wicker discussed the “peacetime effect” on military medical readiness, suggesting that there has been an erosion of physician capability and expertise that could result in unnecessary casualties during wartime. The Chairman encouraged an open conversation about reforms to the bureaucracy and policy changes that could improve the standing of military medical readiness before a major military conflict.

Read Senator Wicker’s hearing opening statement as delivered below.

The hearing will come to order.

The committee has convened this hearing to discuss the state of the military health system. We hope to shine a light on the challenges facing that system and begin working toward solutions.

Our witnesses are experts in the field of military medicine. Dr. Douglas Robb is a retired Air Force Lieutenant General and the former director of the Defense Health Agency (DHA). Dr. Paul Friedrichs is a retired Air Force Major General and the former Joint Staff Surgeon. And Dr. Jeremy Cannon is a retired Air Force Colonel and trauma surgeon who currently serves on the faculty at the University of Pennsylvania School of Medicine.

I look forward to their testimony. I want to hear their recommendations about what Congress and the Department of Defense should do to provide long-term stability to the military health system.

Military medicine often follows a familiar but regrettable cycle. During peacetime, medical teams focus on the treatment of ordinary illnesses. When conflict erupts, military medicine is frequently caught unprepared, resulting in unnecessary casualties.

This interwar erosion of our unique military medical skills is known as the “peacetime effect.” To disrupt the “peacetime effect,” Congress enacted sweeping reforms of the military health system. These reforms, now nearly a decade old, were designed to refocus military medicine on its primary purpose: combat casualty care and medical readiness.

We elevated the Defense Health Agency to a combat support agency and tasked it with administration of all military hospitals and clinics, relieving the military departments of that mission. The goal was to have the military services focus exclusively on the medical readiness of their forces. These ideas were recommended by an independent, bipartisan commission embraced by Pentagon leadership, and signed into law in 2017.

Unfortunately, opponents of these reforms have delayed implementation and undermined the effectiveness of the legislation. For example, in 2019, the military departments implemented drastic cuts to military medical personnel on the faulty assumption that it would be easy for DHA to hire civilians to take their places.

This assumption was misguided, which became evident during the COVID pandemic. During that crisis, the existing national physician shortage accelerated. To this day, private sector health systems seek out and hire away doctors from the military, not the other way around.

We've all seen this in our states. In 2020, Congress ordered a halt to any additional military medical reductions, but it was too late. A significant number of reductions had already occurred, severely reducing the capability of military hospitals. In many locations, the private sector was unable to handle the additional patients, sending more service members to private sector care. This has proven more expensive and has sapped the military doctors’ experiences that are vital to maintaining proficiency.

Even worse, DOD has refused to request adequate funding for DHA, which would allow DHA to staff adequately and equip its hospitals and clinics. Since 2015, the budget for military hospitals has decreased by nearly 12 percent. The water damage at Walter Reed this January is an example of the antiquated infrastructure that military medical teams work with around the world.

In addition to the problems I've just explained, I would like our witnesses to highlight how bureaucratic delays within the Department of Defense have prevented the military health system from preparing for the next potential conflict.

Combat casualty care is the primary purpose of the military health system. When service members are exposed to danger or are injured, they need to know that they will receive the best care possible. We know that troops in combat are more comfortable taking the risks necessary to accomplish their mission if they have confidence in military doctors.

We cannot go back to the way things were before 2017. We must stop scapegoating the Defense Health Agency. The Department of Defense must request adequate resources to ensure the Department’s hospitals and clinics are properly staffed and equipped. This is the best way to ensure the military health system is ready for the potential demands of large-scale combat operations in the future.",https://www.wicker.senate.gov/services/images/06DFDF3C-490D-4BBE-819D-CBDE440B3E04/social,N,0.0,2025-03-11 15:50:32.614242

1 priority for the Military Health System is supporting the warfighter, emphasizing the distinctive “go to war” nature of the MHS mission.
We want to provide high-quality health care here in garrison, as any other top-performing health care system in America does, but we are the only ones that can go to war.
That makes us a unique and a very exciting and interesting health care system, because we must be ready to deliver health care in any corner of the globe at any time.
I think of health care as like an ecosystem where it takes everybody to build.","In one of his first interviews as Acting Assistant Secretary of Defense for Health Affairs, Dr. Stephen Ferrara stated the No. 1 priority for the Military Health System is supporting the warfighter, emphasizing the distinctive “go to war” nature of the MHS mission.

“The MHS is such a unique entity, and there isn’t anything similar in the private or public sector,” said Ferrara. “We are the U.S. health care system that goes to war.”

Ferrara is a retired U.S. Navy doctor who continued to practice medicine after 25 years on active duty until being appointed into his current role on Jan. 20, 2025. Prior to his present position, he served as the deputy director for clinical operations for the National Capital Region, the Department of Defense’s largest health care network. He also served as an interventional radiologist at Walter Reed National Military Medical Center and a clinical professor of radiology and radiological sciences at the Uniformed Services University of the Health Sciences.

Soon after assuming his new role, he met with MHS health care personnel at several military hospitals and clinics to see “granular detail that you can only get by going and talking to the people that are doing the work … because I want them to know that I am their voice and I'm there for them,” he said.

He explained the role of the Assistant Secretary is similar to a CEO of a global corporation. “I represent the civilian leadership oversight of the military, which makes me a conduit to the Secretary of Defense and to the White House,” Ferrara said. “I can help get what our folks need to be able to succeed and be that voice, because I know their priorities are to make sure we are delivering the best health care to not only our active duty, but our retired and dependent beneficiaries.”

The MHS has a worldwide mission to provide health care to more than 9 million people at over 800 medical and dental facilities, service-specific operational units, and the TRICARE Health Plan’s worldwide network of civilian providers.

In this interview, Ferrara discussed the MHS’ unique ability to deploy medical services globally, support readiness for future wars, and spearhead innovation in medical technology. He also shared his commitment for excellence and his personal investment in the MHS.

You can watch excerpts from the interview at this link (insert link).

Question: What drove you to join the U.S. Navy and become a military doctor?

Ferrara: I love telling this story. I joined the [U.S.] Navy, because I was a senior in college when the first Gulf War broke out and I was deciding which medical school to attend … some of us remember the surge of patriotism that was around at the time, and I reflected on it. My dad was a Korean War veteran. He got the GI bill and went on to get a college degree in law school. There I was with all these opportunities. Really, it was kind of the embodiment in the American dream. When the war broke out, I knew I was going to go into a trauma-related specialty, I felt this was an opportunity for me to give back, because I know a lot of the people that do a lot of the heavy lifting for our country in harm's way are people that were like my dad. I did that in 1991 … almost 35 years later, I am still involved in the MHS. It has been such a great career and a great mission.

Question: How does the MHS support the Department of Defense in achieving its goals and objectives?

Ferrara: What makes me so proud of the MHS is that we are a force multiplier for the warfighter. We improve and increase the lethality of the warfighter, and we do that through a number of ways. If you look at what our primary mission is—supporting the warfighter in combat—it is very empowering. It is a sacred pact we have with the warfighter that when they go into harm's way, should they become ill or injured, they can have the confidence of knowing they are going to get world-class health care immediately on the battlefield and have the best opportunity to return home healthy. That empowers the warfighter to be able to take the risks necessary and have that confidence to do those difficult missions and know that we are there backing them up. I think we have seen around the world recently; most other countries do not do that for their soldiers. We have seen that in battlefields in Europe and other places in the world. That is a real strategic edge that America has because we do that. It is expensive, it is complicated, but it is 100% aligned with American values.

Question: You recently toured military hospitals and clinics. What have you taken away from those visits, and do you plan to do any more in the future?

Ferrara: Town halls to me are a major priority, because I feel that having spent 25 years on active duty, I feel a very close kinship to the people that are doing the work at the military hospitals and clinics. I also understand a little bit about the size and scope of the MHS; it is a very large system. These visits help identify issues and improve morale. I want to show my appreciation and support for the workforce and let them know that their voice is heard, and their needs will be advocated for, and that they have a voice in the Pentagon.

It is always inspiring to me to see the people doing the work, because you see the folks in uniform, the ones that are 18-19-years old, all the way up through later parts of their career—and all our civilians and contracting partners who support us and their incredible ability to execute on the mission.

It is no secret that we are in challenging times, sometimes with resource limitations. There is a peace dividend, as the wars have ramped down, but the mission has not changed. [The] majority of our mission is taking care of dependents and retirees. That mission really stays the same. So, those folks must continue to execute on that mission, even when they do not necessarily have the resources that might come along with the resources that flow during wartime. They are a source of inspiration to me and helps energize me for my job. I am also able to find out about a lot of things that are going on—whether it is facilities issues, or whether it is processing issues that I would not otherwise know about—I can take back to my team for action.

The biggest takeaway is the inspiration I draw from it is the incredible morale. People are always there. They have been energetic, and they have been upbeat. They really are so mission focused, and it is a very virtuous cycle. I hope that by going to them, it helps them know that I really care about what they do. My team is working on getting to places across the whole spectrum, and not just focusing on large places, because it is good to get to small places throughout the country and overseas, because we are a complicated organization, and it is important to see them.

Question: What priorities have you set for the MHS to ensure that we are advancing the care provided to our beneficiaries?

Ferrara: My number one priority is supporting the warfighter. We are a Military Health System that goes to war, which makes us completely unique in America. We want to provide high-quality health care here in garrison, as any other top-performing health care system in America does, but we are the only ones that can go to war. I want to be keenly focused on, “are we ready to go to war?” I think we all understand that the next war will be a different battlefield landscape and medical care delivery landscape than prior wars. When I was in Afghanistan, we had 3-role-3 hospitals that were fixed facilities. We had the “golden hour.” We had air superiority. It was a difficult mission. We became really good at providing really good care.

I think if we pivot and we look at the threats in the Indo-Pacific, in that first island chain, it is much different in how it is distributed. It is a much more the tyranny of distance. I was a West Coast sailor for most of my life. I sailed from San Diego to Africa and back many times, and when you realize the ocean is 54% the surface of the Earth, the challenges of providing that health care and not having that golden hour. How do we provide prolonged field care? How do we have the people with the training, the platforms and infrastructure to be able to do that? That is my top priority.

What flows from what we do here on the continent in the MTFs—making sure that our folks always have a ready medical force so that people are getting the reps and sets they need to be able to continue to be ready to go at a moment's notice, and that they're at the top of their game. These are our force-generation platforms, and the military is a relatively young person's occupation. We can serve a full career and retire before you are 50 years old. We always have to be mindful of that. We are passing along the baton, and we are making sure that we are training that next generation. We do that through many platforms, a lot of that in our MTFs. Whether we are training surgical technologists to be able to support battlefield surgeries, whether we are training logisticians to learn how to order the supplies that are needed to enable medical teams to do what they need to do—all those kinds of things that we do so that we can succeed.

Question: Do you believe that aspect of the MHS makes us the most strong and innovative?

Ferrara: I think we are. We are certainly the strongest. We are the most resilient. I think that's part of our culture. When I joined, without a lot of forethought, I certainly did not envision that I would still be involved 35 years later. What makes this such a fulfilling and interesting type of career is we are always innovating, and it is never the same. We are not in status quo. We are doing things that are tackling new and difficult issues all the time and getting better at difficult missions.

We are looking hard at leveraging technology. How are those folks’ delivering health care in austere environments on the next battlefield? How are we going to equip them to succeed and to take great care of patients? I think we are looking to what can we do, looking at synchronous and asynchronous technologies to support them, either in the moment, remotely, or with tools they can have that are technology enabled to be able to do those things, and that is not a need in the private sector. That makes us a unique and a very exciting and interesting health care system, because we must be ready to deliver health care in any corner of the globe at any time.

One of the things that I am most proud of in the MHS, over a century and a half, a lot of the greatest innovations in medicine have come from military medicine. We continue that legacy. We sit on broad shoulders, but we know that we are not done. The next challenges will bring new innovations for us, and we try to speed ahead so that we are ready when we do.

Question: How do you see the ongoing budget discussions impacting the MHS?

Ferrara: I appreciate the question because it is important, and it is on a lot of people’s minds. I would like to start with the fact that it is my priority, as well as the administration’s, in delivering high-quality, safe health care. Supporting the warfighter will never be compromised.

I think it is also clear, and the American people understand this, there are a lot of opportunities for more efficiency across the federal government. I think as the largest department in the discretionary spending category, [DOD] would be remiss if we did not look at how we utilize the taxpayer dollar and make sure we are using it as well as we can. I think we are taking a very thoughtful approach to this. We are looking at all the areas where we spend money. We look at things where there are opportunities to leverage technology, to do things more efficiently, and with a better value. We are looking at things that are duplicative, where we could streamline, where other departments across government do some of the same functions and see if those things could be better allocated.

I think it is a process, and we are going to work through it and see where things fall when we take a zero-based budgeting approach to how we spend money—and that we will never compromise our ability to support warfighters when they go downrange. America's mothers and fathers put their children in harm’s way, and it is our solemn pact to make sure we take good care of them and money will not be an issue.

Question: What is the primary message you want to share with service members and military families as the Acting Assistant Secretary of Defense for Health Affairs?

Ferrara: The number one thing is—I am their voice. When I try to describe what the role of the Assistant Secretary of Defense for Health Affairs is, I do not know that I would have known that when I was early in my career. This role sits as the CEO of this large, complicated health care system, and be that person that is making the decisions on manpower, on how we resource our substantial budget, and how we utilize it most effectively. I represent the civilian leadership oversight of the military, which makes me be that conduit to the Secretary of Defense and to the White House and get what our folks need to be able to succeed. Their priorities are to make sure we are delivering the best health care to our not only our active duty, but our retired and dependent beneficiaries.

Question: What is the primary message that you want to share with the workforce serving around the world?

Ferrara: The first thing would be to extend my thanks. I have deployed four times, and I am a military spouse. My wife is still on active duty. She is deployed. When I sit down at dinner, we have 59 years in uniform and eight deployments. I know what people sacrifice. I missed a lot of birthdays, missed a lot of those things. There is a lot of sacrifice that goes into being part of the workforce and the MHS, but people do it, and they turn on a dime, and they do amazing things.

The most important thing I could say is to let them know that I appreciate what they do, I know what they do, and that I am trying to help them get what they need. I know people sometimes feel like you are a little bit … sort of isolated and alone, or you may not have a voice. We are a very large system, and I am trying to help make the system feel smaller to people, so that they do not feel as far removed, and so that that their voice is heard and that their voice does get transmitted. I think of health care as like an ecosystem where it takes everybody to build. It is not just the surgeon wielding the scalpel—which is the face they saw—but behind that surgeon is a huge cadre of people from logisticians, technologists, to nurses, to environmental services people, to facilities managers that are doing all those things to make sure that we were able to deliver.

There is a good military analogy … for a trigger-puller to do what he or she needs to do, the tail on that is immense so that they are fed, they are clothed, they are housed, they are warm, they have the ammunition they need, their weapon works. All those things so they can execute that mission, which is really the primary mission, relies on all those people. Health care is the same. There are a lot of things we are constantly doing to make sure that our people have great outcomes, and they should not have to worry, but they just know that when they go in, they trust us, and we reciprocate the trust by doing our work.",https://d1ldvf68ux039x.cloudfront.net/thumbs/photos/2503/8908843/1000w_q95.jpg,N,1.0,2025-03-11 14:53:48.554438

Medical monitoring for cases of communicable diseases such as Legionnaires’ disease is a public health measure that prevents larger-scale disease occurrence.
“In addition, most healthy people who are exposed to Legionella bacteria will not become ill with either Legionnaires’ disease or Pontiac fever.
Legionellosis comprises the illnesses (Legionnaires’ disease, Pontiac fever) caused by the Legionella bacteria.
However, Legionnaires’ disease shares many of the same risk factors as other pneumonias, so getting a pneumococcal vaccine, as well as a respiratory syncytial virus, or RSV, vaccine, as recommended, may reduce the risk of severe Legionnaires’ disease.","Legionnaires’ disease, a severe type of pneumonia, was so named in 1976 after a Pennsylvania outbreak of a mystery illness that sickened over 200 and killed 34 in two weeks. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention identified the cause of the illness to be a particular type of bacteria. Legionella bacteria were discovered in the cooling towers of a hotel that had been used for an American Legion convention.

“The risk of Legionnaires’ disease is lower now that scientists have learned more about its cause and effective prevention tactics,” says Dr. Charles McCannon, a preventive medicine physician working for Defense Health Agency-Public Health in Aberdeen, Maryland. “While the risk is low, cases still occur.”

Outbreaks occur when two or more people are exposed to Legionella in the same place and get sick at about the same time, says McCannon. The last outbreak confirmed by the military was in 2010 at Selfridge Air National Guard Base, Michigan.

Medical monitoring for cases of communicable diseases such as Legionnaires’ disease is a public health measure that prevents larger-scale disease occurrence.

Tracking Cases in the Military

To identify potential outbreaks and prevent additional exposures to the hazardous bacteria, both the CDC and the U.S. military require medical facilities to report cases of Legionnaires’ disease.

Alexis Maule, a senior epidemiologist with the Preventive Medicine Division of DHA-PH at Aberdeen, explains that the name Legionellosis is now used to refer to both Legionnaires’ disease and Pontiac fever, a milder illness without pneumonia.

“Most people with Pontiac fever likely do not seek treatment for their illness,” says Maule. “In addition, most healthy people who are exposed to Legionella bacteria will not become ill with either Legionnaires’ disease or Pontiac fever. That means the extent of exposure may underreported, but we are identifying cases needing treatment at military medical facilities.”

Even with the expanded case definition, the military has not found Legionellosis to be a commonly reported disease. This is generally consistent with CDC findings though there are higher rates in the general population.

“In the past five years, 87 Legionellosis cases have been reported to the military’s medical reporting system, and only half of these were confirmed to be Legionnaires’ disease,” says Maule. “In addition, the disease was most frequently reported in retirees, while less than a third of reported cases were active-duty military personnel.”

Maule explains that this makes sense because age is risk factor for Legionellosis, and many retirees were noted to already have chronic medical conditions unrelated to Legionellosis, making this group more susceptible to any type of bacterial infection.

McCannon and Maule provide answers to questions about Legionellosis:

Frequently Asked Questions

Q. What is Legionellosis?

Legionellosis comprises the illnesses (Legionnaires’ disease, Pontiac fever) caused by the Legionella bacteria. Many species of Legionella bacteria can cause disease, but the presence of the bacteria in the environment or even in a clinical sample (such as urine or blood) does not mean a person is or will become ill with a disease. The majority of disease is caused by Legionella pneumophila, particularly a sub type known as serogroup 1.

Because the bacteria have the potential to cause harm (even if no clinical cases are reported), the presence of Legionella bacteria detected in a facility is considered a hazard to be remediated. Protocols have been established to ensure proper sanitation is achieved.

Q. How does a person get sick with Legionnaires’ disease?

The primary way people are exposed is by breathing in water droplets that carry the Legionella bacteria. Less commonly, Legionella may be transmitted via aspiration of drinking water. Exposed persons who become sick do not transmit the infection to others.

While Legionella bacteria occur naturally in freshwater environments, they primarily cause disease after growing in certain human-made water systems that aerosolize water. Complex air conditioning cooling towers of large structures such as hotels, hospitals, long-term care facilities, and cruise ships are a particular concern. Water systems and air-conditioning units of private homes are generally not exposure sources. Cases have occasionally been attributed to personal hot tubs, whirlpool spas and even decorative fountains.

The CDC reports that since the 1976 outbreak, agencies around the world now have more stringent cleaning and hygiene standards for cooling towers and large-scale air-conditioning systems. But the conditions outside the U.S. may present more of a concern.

Q. What are symptoms of Legionellosis?

Legionellosis symptoms can include fever and other flu-like symptoms such as muscle aches and cough and can begin hours to several days after bacteria are inhaled. Legionnaires’ disease symptoms begin two to 14 days after exposure and can be confirmed when Legionella bacteria infect cells in the air sacs of the lung. This condition can be life-threatening, but it is treatable with antibiotics.

The symptoms of Pontiac fever develop in five hours to a few days; it is a milder illness—without pneumonia—characterized by dry cough or sore throat, fever, chills, fatigue, headache and sore muscles.

Q. How is Legionellosis diagnosed?

Diagnosis is based on clinical findings, such as signs of pneumonia identified with a chest x-ray, and medical laboratory antigen confirmation of the unique type of the bacteria, known as serotype in the patient. If environmental samples are available, they can be compared to the bacteria type found in patient samples. If the bacteria type does not match the type found at an environmental source of concern, other exposure sources are considered.

Q. Are certain people at higher risk of Legionellosis?

Most healthy people who are exposed to Legionella bacteria do not get infected with disease. Certain behaviors such as smoking, recent travel with an overnight stay outside of the home, recent care at a healthcare facility, and hot tub use are risk factors that would be considered if determining a case.

The risk of Legionellosis is higher among persons over 50 and those with chronic lung disease, immune system disorders due to disease or medication, systemic malignancy, or an underlying illness such as diabetes, renal failure, or hepatic failure. The younger, relatively healthy and vaccinated active-duty population has a lower risk for severe disease from Legionella exposure compared to the general population.

Q. Does risk of Legionellosis depend on location or time?

Within the U.S., the CDC has shown a higher number of cases of Legionellosis in the northern and mid-western states. There is some seasonality to the risk of Legionellosis, with higher risk of infection in the summer through fall months because temperate conditions allow for the growth of the bacteria.

Q. How is Legionellosis differentiated from other pneumonias?

Pneumonia is a generalized term for inflammation and infection of the air sacs in one or both lungs resulting in fluid in the lungs. Air sacs fill with fluid or pus, causing a productive cough with phlegm, and often fever, chills and difficulty breathing.

Pneumonia can be a symptom of many different diseases and can be caused by a range of organisms, including bacteria (such as Legionnaires’ disease and Q fever), viruses (such as COVID-19 and certain flu viruses), and fungi (such as Coccidioidomycosis [“Valley fever”]). The severity of pneumonia infection can range from mild to life-threatening. Bacterial pneumonia is usually more severe than viral pneumonia.

Pneumonia caused by Legionella bacteria is only differentiated from other pneumonias by medical tests/laboratory tests to determine the cause of the pneumonia.

Q. Does the pneumonia vaccine help against Legionellosis?

There is no vaccine against Legionellosis, and none of the available pneumococcal vaccines protect against the Legionella bacteria. However, Legionnaires’ disease shares many of the same risk factors as other pneumonias, so getting a pneumococcal vaccine, as well as a respiratory syncytial virus, or RSV, vaccine, as recommended, may reduce the risk of severe Legionnaires’ disease.

While some might wonder why this information is necessary, the answer is clear—it benefits both patients and the Military Health System.

The Military Health System provides care to service members, retirees, and their families, but it is also designed to work in conjunction with private insurance companies. When a patient has Other Health Insurance (OHI), such as a civilian employer’s health plan or private insurance, benefits can be coordinated to ensure costs are appropriately distributed.

By billing private insurance providers, the uniform business office recoups funds that are reinvested into patient care, facility improvements, and medical readiness. In fiscal year 2024 alone, the UBO team at Bassett Army Community Hospital recovered over $1.8 million and are on track to bring in approximately $2 million this year.

According to Ivy, this income helps our patients here locally.

“Money brought into MEDDAC-AK through OHI benefits Bassett and our outlying clinics across the state by putting that money back into our budget,” said Tyra Ivy, Chief of UBO at MEDDAC-AK. “Ultimately the income we bring in goes back into providing care to our patients.""

OHI Benefits

Disclosing OHI does not increase out-of-pocket expenses for patients. Instead, it ensures the private insurance plan pays its share of medical costs, which helps sustain military healthcare resources.

For patients, using OHI can also result in long-term savings.

“UBO does not bill TRICARE beneficiaries, and when they use their OHI, it helps them to meet their deductible, which may save them money, if they are referred off post,” Ivy explained.

Additionally, accurate OHI information helps prevent billing errors and claim denials. When providers have up-to-date insurance details, claims are processed correctly, reducing administrative delays and potential out-of-pocket costs for patients.

Your Role in Keeping Records Accurate

To ensure the system works efficiently, beneficiaries should:

• Provide their OHI information/VA Coverage at every visit.

• Report any changes in insurance coverage to the military treatment facility and TRICARE.

• If utilizing VA benefits ensure authorization is complete and verify at check in.

“Patients provide their OHI by filling out form DD2569 annually and updating the information when checking in for appointments,” Ivy said. ""While it is an annual requirement, we encourage patients to let us know any time they have changes to their OHI.""

Working Together for a Stronger System

MEDDAC-AK is committed to providing world-class care to those who serve and their families. By sharing OHI information, patients play a vital role in supporting military healthcare operations, improving resources, and ensuring fiscal responsibility within the system.

The next time you check in for an appointment, take a moment to verify your insurance details. It’s a small step that makes a big impact—for you, for the military community, and for the future of military medicine.

Recognizing this, TRICARE covers many substance abuse treatments, including drug and alcohol rehab and alcohol detox. Knowing what's covered is key for veterans to get back to health and well-being.

In this article for Start Motion Media, we will cover if TRICARE covers alcohol detox, what services are included and how to get treatment. We will also go over how to navigate the system so detox services are fully covered.

Health Coverage for Alcohol Detox

TRICARE is a health insurance program for active-duty service members, retirees and their families. It covers mental health and substance use disorder (SUD) treatment which includes alcohol detox. But coverage varies depending on the veteran's TRICARE plan, the facility's network status and medical necessity.

What Type of Alcohol Detox Does TRICARE Cover?

TRICARE generally covers both inpatient and outpatient detox when medically necessary.

Inpatient Detox: This is for individuals who need 24/7 medical supervision to manage withdrawal symptoms safely. Veterans with severe withdrawal or co-occurring disorders may need inpatient care.

Outpatient Detox: This is for individuals with milder withdrawal symptoms and a stable home environment. Treatment includes medication-assisted therapy (MAT), counseling and regular medical supervision.

VA Health Care and Addiction Treatment

VA health care covers comprehensive addiction treatment including substance use disorder treatment and mental health services. Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) offers a range of services to address substance use disorders and co-occurring mental health conditions.

Veterans can get addiction treatment services through their local VA medical center or clinic or through vet Centers. VA also offers evidence-based treatment for substance use disorder including therapies, medication or both.

Find Veteran Detox Centers at Your Local VA Medical Center

Veterans seeking alcohol detox services should start by making sure the facility they choose is TRICARE-approved. Many treatment programs across the country accept TRICARE so it's easy to find good care. Finding TRICARE detox centers nationwide will help veterans connect with the right facility for them.

TRICARE divides healthcare providers into network and non-network facilities:

Network providers have agreements with TRICARE so out-of-pocket costs are lower. Non-network providers may still accept TRICARE but may require higher co-pays or extra paperwork for approval.

How to Get Detox Covered by VA Health Benefits as a Veteran

Navigating TRICARE's coverage can be overwhelming but knowing the steps can make it easier. Here's how veterans can get detox covered by insurance as a veteran:

Confirm Eligibility: TRICARE coverage depends on the veteran's specific health insurance plan. TRICARE Prime, Select and Reserve Select have different levels of coverage for detox services.

Get a Referral or Pre-Authorization: Some detox programs require a referral from a TRICARE-authorized provider. Check with TRICARE or the treatment facility to confirm requirements.

Choose a Covered Facility: Select a treatment center within TRICARE's network to maximize benefits and minimize out-of-pocket costs.

Understand Co-Pays and Costs: Depending on the TRICARE plan there may be no out-of-pocket costs for detox services.

Seek Continued Care: Detox is the first step in long-term recovery. TRICARE also covers follow-up services such as inpatient rehabilitation, outpatient counseling and medication-assisted treatment (MAT).

Using VA Health Benefits for Private Rehab

Veterans can use their VA health benefits to pay for private addiction treatment. VA allows veterans to supplement their VA benefits with other insurance plans such as private health insurance, Medicare, Medicaid or TRICARE.

Veterans should inform their addiction treatment provider about their multiple insurance coverages and VA will bill the supplemental health insurance provider first. Payments received from other insurance providers can offset some or all of the VA copay costs.

Additional Health Benefits for Substance Use Disorder Treatment

Choosing the right treatment program is key to long-term recovery. Beyond detox TRICARE covers:

Residential rehabilitation programs for veterans who need structured long-term treatment.

Partial hospitalization programs (PHPs) that provide intensive daytime treatment while allowing individuals to go home at night.

Intensive outpatient programs (IOPs) for veterans who need structured therapy but can still maintain daily responsibilities.

Medication-assisted treatment (MAT) to manage withdrawal symptoms and reduce cravings.

Individual and group therapy sessions to address underlying mental health issues related to addiction.

Your Rights and VA Health-Covered Rehab

Veterans have the right to confidentiality when seeking addiction treatment through VA health care. However, there may be some limitations to this right such as the Military Command Exception which allows for disclosure of treatment information to Command officers in certain circumstances.

Veterans should understand their rights and the limitations of confidentiality when seeking addiction treatment through VA health care.

Barriers to Treatment and How to Overcome Them

While TRICARE covers detox and other substance use treatments some veterans may face barriers to care. Common challenges include:

Lack of Awareness: Many veterans are not aware TRICARE covers alcohol detox.

Bureaucratic Challenges: Navigating the healthcare system can be complicated especially when referrals or pre-authorizations are required.

Stigma Surrounding Addiction: Some veterans may not seek help due to the stigma of substance use disorders.

To overcome these barriers:

Educate Yourself: Understanding TRICARE benefits can empower veterans to seek the care they need.

Reach Out for Help: Veteran support organizations and TRICARE representatives can help.

Advocate for Your Health: Be proactive in seeking care and understanding treatment options.

Navigating VA Health Benefits with Support

Veterans can navigate their VA health benefits with support from their primary care provider at the VA. Advocating for oneself by telling the VA provider you want to see a community care provider can be a big step.

Tricare Rehabs can help veterans navigate the process and understand what steps are needed to get authorized for care. Our veteran advocates are trained to help veterans understand VA health benefits and the process of getting care.

Payment Options and Financing for Veteran Rehab

Veterans have several payment options and financing options for rehab. VA health benefits can cover the cost of addiction treatment and veterans can also use their VA benefits to supplement other insurance plans.

VA has various financing options including copays and deductibles and veterans can also look into private financing options such as loans or credit cards. Veterans should discuss payment options and financing options with their addiction treatment provider to determine the best course of action.

Step 3: Receive Your FDA-approved Oral Appliance Once your sleep apnea diagnosis is confirmed, we begin the pre-authorization process to get your appliance approved.","Combat Fatigue & Brain Fog With a Fully-Customized Oral Appliance

When exhaustion becomes a normal aspect of your life, it’s easy to brush it off as part of getting older or having to balance the rigors of civilian life.

But for many veterans, that overwhelming fatigue has a medical cause—untreated sleep apnea.

Every night, your airway may be closing dozens or hundreds of times, cutting off oxygen and forcing your brain to jolt you awake in order to breathe.

The following signs become more and more obvious because you’re prevented from reaching deep, restorative sleep—even if you’re in bed for seven to eight hours:

You wake up groggy and often with a headache

You notice slower reaction times or sluggish reflexes

You have difficulty concentrating on your day-to-day tasks

Your memory lapses are beginning to interfere with daily life

You are quick to go from feeling happy to sad, irritable, or angry

Your energy tanks by mid-day

No amount of caffeine seems to help

Let us help. Sleep Apnea Solutions – Texas Hill Country is Tricare-approved and part of the VA Community Care Network.

This means you may be eligible for a fully covered, custom-fitted oral appliance at no cost to you.

We can fit you with a device similar to a mouthguard that improves your breathing function while you sleep.

There’s no waiting period and no out-of-pocket expense if you have Tricare.

If you’ve already had a sleep study through the VA, you could be fitted for the appliance right away. We’ll help you get one scheduled if not.

Dental Appliances for Sleep Apnea Patients in Texas Hill Country

Tricare covers custom oral appliances for veterans with sleep apnea, but acquiring one isn’t always as straightforward as it should be.

You might not know where to start or be stuck waiting on VA approvals that seem to take forever.

That’s why we have built our process around one goal—getting your treatment approved and delivered as quickly as possible without the runaround.

Sleep Apnea Solutions – Texas Hill Country Can Help

We’ll verify your Tricare benefits and confirm if you already have a qualifying sleep study on record the moment you reach out to us.

If you don’t, we’ll help coordinate a sleep test through the local VA office or an authorized civilian provider.

We schedule your consultation immediately and fast-track the appointment so you can receive digital scans of your teeth and jaw once your referral is approved.

Your custom oral appliance will be fabricated and ready for fitting within two to three weeks of this appointment.

Step 1: Get a Referral

You must obtain a referral from a VA provider before starting treatment with us if you already receive healthcare through the VA Community Care Program.

You can request a sleep medicine referral through My HealtheVet or by calling your local VA office if you have a VA primary care provider.

If you don’t have a VA PCP or you haven’t been evaluated for sleep apnea yet, our team can help you request a consultation through the Texas Hill Country VA system.

We’ll walk you through exactly what to say to them to avoid unnecessary delays and handle all the paperwork and pre-authorizations once your referral is approved.

You may or may not need a referral if you have Tricare Prime, Select, or Tricare for Life.

We always confirm your specific coverage upfront so you know exactly what to expect.

Step 2: Take a Sleep Study

If you haven’t had a sleep study in the past 12 months, the VA or Tricare may require one before approving an oral appliance.

The VA can provide a home sleep apnea test free of charge if you’re using VA benefits. This usually requires another referral.

We can arrange a home sleep study through a private Tricare-approved provider.

Home-based testing is very simple. You wear a small device at home for one night, and a board-certified sleep physician analyzes the data.

You will be eligible for an oral appliance if your study confirms obstructive sleep apnea.

We’ll request your report from the VA office or help you get a copy for VA and Tricare approval if you have already taken the study.

Step 3: Receive Your FDA-approved Oral Appliance

Once your sleep apnea diagnosis is confirmed, we begin the pre-authorization process to get your appliance approved.

The VA office issues an authorization number to see us under Community Care and we submit all necessary treatment plans to ensure your device is fully paid for.

You pay nothing—the VA covers 100% of the cost for eligible veterans.

We can also verify your Tricare coverage and any required documentation.

We will handle additional medical justification for you if they ask.

Most Tricare plans cover the majority or all of the cost, and we make sure you know upfront if there’s any co-pay.",https://www.sleepapneasolutionstx.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Favicon-150x150.png,N,0.0,2025-03-11 06:50:27.386809

Second, most major MTFs do not have a civilian trauma care mission to bolster their trauma readiness.
In other locations, state governments have simply refused to allow local MTFs to be included in the civilian trauma care system.
Invest in the military medicine training pipeline Concurrently, we need to invest in the education and training of medical personnel for the unique military medical mission.
We should have 6 to 10 large civilian medical centers committed to hosting active duty and reserve military personnel as their usual place of work for casualty receiving bed capacity and military medical personnel skills maintenance.","The Military Health System (MHS) is a unique organization with broad responsibility. On one hand, it plays a critical role in the care of injured U.S. service members. On the other hand, it has also been tasked with providing healthcare services to nearly 10 million military personnel and their families

Any organization of this scale will struggle with inefficiency and redundancy. For decades, I have heard some question whether we need an MHS at all. I believe the solid answer is yes due to the system’s unique mission.

However, in this time of government restructuring and downsizing, there lies an opportunity. As the new administration looks to cut waste and unneeded programs from the federal government, now is the time to right-size the MHS and refocus it on its unique mission — providing deployed medical care.

Current landscape of U.S. military healthcare

First, some background: Concurrently with casualty care, the MHS serves all the medical needs of 9.5 million beneficiaries around the world. This includes active duty service members, their families and military retirees. The system’s FY24 budget of $58.7 billion represents 7% of the total Department of Defense (DoD) budget of $842 billion.

Arguably the most unique and important function of the MHS is to care for combat injuries and other unique wartime disease. For that reason, one would believe that most of the system’s spending would be dedicated to this mission. However, the fact is that the majority of the MHS budget goes toward (a) operating the military hospitals known as Medical Treatment Facilities (MTFs) to care for beneficiaries and (b) paying for purchased care in locations without an MTF.

While most MTFs are dedicated to beneficiary care, a number of larger MTFs — such as Walter Reed National Military Medical Center — also serve as casualty receiving hospitals for service members who are critically ill or injured while deployed. In fact, a handful of major MTFs have cared for over 50,000 wounded service members since 2001. This “final mile” of trauma care is a key aspect of the MHS mission, and it includes the acute critical care phase through surgical reconstruction, rehabilitation and restoration of function.

The combat care mission of the MHS is embodied in the Joint Trauma System (JTS), which provides clinical leadership and oversight to the trauma care provided to injured service members. This care extends from initial battlefield treatment, to forward deployed surgical teams, to care during evacuation, and finally to ongoing critical care and rehabilitation at major MTFs.

Although the JTS does not own or command military medics and medical units, it ensures the clinical knowledge and skills readiness of medical personnel, provides best practice guidelines for all roles of care in deployed combat medicine, and advises commanders at all levels regarding the synchronization of operational and clinical decision making.

The JTS was initially established in 2003 at a time when the number of casualties in Iraq and Afghanistan were ramping up and there was a realization that the MHS needed to step up to meet these demands. Since then, the JTS continues to be a critical component of the unique MHS mission and has matured into a permanent organization to continuously stand ready to ensure the best care for our military service members who bravely fight for our freedom around the world.

Why the current plan is not working

We are currently in a relatively quiescent interwar period, but future conflicts with peer opponents such as China, Russia, North Korea, and Iran present the risk of higher numbers of combat casualties for protracted periods of time.

What can the MHS do in between conflicts to sustain the trauma capabilities of the MTFs as well as the skills of medical personnel who must be immediately ready to go?

The usual answer is to leverage the system’s “beneficiary care” mission to maintain trauma readiness. Unfortunately, there are several issues with this idea.

First, the active duty beneficiaries and their families who use MTFs are a generally healthy population. As such, they can provide military medical personnel with nearly no experience in delivering complex medical and surgical care. In fact, the military has allowed a large portion of its older beneficiaries (who often do require complex care) to receive their care through Tricare contracts, meaning purchased civilian healthcare. Still other retirees and veterans receive care through the Department of Veterans Affairs. The end result is the common situation where active duty medical personnel (including physicians and nurses) are assigned to work in MTFs that have very few patients.

Second, most major MTFs do not have a civilian trauma care mission to bolster their trauma readiness. (The one exception is Brooke Army Medical Center in San Antonio, which is the military’s only Level I trauma center.) In some locations, the military MTF is perceived as unneeded by the surrounding community because a sufficient number of civilian trauma centers exist. In other locations, state governments have simply refused to allow local MTFs to be included in the civilian trauma care system. It is true that some jurisdictions have allowed MTFs to participate in the civilian trauma system as extra capacity during extreme circumstances (such as disasters), but this is not enough to sustain these MTFs with a steady flow of patients. In a handful of cases, states have allowed MTFs to send personnel to local civilian trauma centers. While this is helpful for sustaining the skills of the individuals involved, it does little to help non-participating medical personnel or sustain the MTF trauma program itself.

Third, the nationwide shortage of both physicians and nurses means that there are not enough graduating providers to fill the needs of civilian hospitals much less the U.S. military. The Uniformed Services University (USU) School of Medicine and Nursing in Bethesda, Maryland, educates a critical mass of career military medical officers who fill the majority of medical operational positions such as command surgeons. The major MTFs provide the training sites for these future military medical personnel; but, as noted above, many do not have the patient volumes to succeed in this mission. Similarly, the civilian sector cannot support training slots for the numbers and types of specialties required by the DoD to provide battlefield trauma and medical care.

How to refocus and strengthen the MHS

Given the challenges facing military healthcare, I propose that the time is now for the MHS to right-size and refocus on its core mission. To get this right, we must create a coherent strategy based on the unique aspects and critical responsibilities of the MHS.

1. Refocus on the core military mission

The first priority should be to refocus the MHS budget and operations on combat casualty care and deployed medical care. The MHS should be transformed into a functional medical command whose only mission is providing optimal care for deployed military service members around the globe.

This functional command will focus on deployed medicine, including combat casualty care from the point of injury to transport and initial life-saving stabilization. It will serve to sustain and augment the two decades of knowledge and experience developed by the JTS.

2. Invest in core MTFs, divest from the rest

The status quo of taxpayer-funded MTFs that are bereft of patients has not worked for decades. However, we cannot close all the MTFs to cut costs because the MHS would then lose the ability to complete its most critical mission. The solution is to maintain and invest heavily in a core group of major MTFs that support the unique military mission of the MHS and divest from the rest.

We can begin by strategically identifying 6 to 10 major MTFs in the continental U.S. and 4 to 6 others in key locations around the globe. We should then reduce or eliminate purchased civilian care for beneficiaries except for locations not in reasonable proximity to a core MTF. This change will fill the core MTFs with beneficiary patients, which will enhance training for military providers and help maintain MTF capabilities for future conflicts.

3. Reduce redundancy between MTFs and VA hospitals

The third priority is to reduce the redundancy between the Veteran’s Administration (VA) health system and the DoD MHS. In locations where both federal departments operate a hospital, the VA hospital can be combined with the military MTF or eliminated. This will reduce redundancy and costs while still abiding by our promise to care for retirees and veterans who have served valiantly. It will also provide more complex patients to help maintain the skills and the capabilities of the core MTFs.

4. Invest in the military medicine training pipeline

Concurrently, we need to invest in the education and training of medical personnel for the unique military medical mission. USU should be leveraged as the centerpiece of this system, since it has a proven record of educating military medical students who often serve out a 20-year career and who also tend to fill many of the military’s command surgeon positions. The core MTFs can provide essential training during a time when the country is suffering from a shortage of physicians and nurses.

As we all know, it takes years to educate and train military medical personnel, so building this pipeline is not something we can decide at the last minute when a conflict develops. Acting on this now is the only way to ensure we have a continuously flowing pipeline of medical personnel ready for the next conflict.

5. Embrace military-civilian partnerships

Lastly, DoD and civilian healthcare leaders should embrace military-civilian partnerships as a national responsibility and priority. A handful of civilian trauma centers should maintain military hospital staff and beds within their walls. This arrangement will provide personnel and resources to care for injured and ill civilians during normal times, and it can also provide rapid capacity for responding in times of disaster.

The “Mission Zero Act” already describes this arrangement, but the legislation needs to be fully funded and probably further enhanced. We should have 6 to 10 large civilian medical centers committed to hosting active duty and reserve military personnel as their usual place of work for casualty receiving bed capacity and military medical personnel skills maintenance.

Big change needed

Those of us who have served a medical career in the U.S. military implicitly understand what needs to be done to correct the course of the MHS.

Attempts at making incremental changes to the MHS have failed for decades. That’s the status quo. Without big change — and now seems to be the right time for suggesting big change — the MHS will not be ready for future conflicts.

If the new administration decides to address waste reduction in the DoD, it needs to start by assembling a team of military medical subject matter experts who have not been part of maintaining the status quo.

The MHS must remain intact to prevent loss of life and provide rehabilitation and recovery for those injured protecting our freedom, but refocusing the system on its core military mission is critical to ensuring that we are ready for future conflicts",https://trauma-news.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/cropped-android-chrome-512x512-1-32x32.png,N,0.0,2025-03-11 00:50:27.620002

After the first round of Defense Department firings last week, the details of who was laid off — and why — are starting to emerge.
There are no rules to the game,” one of the fired probationary workers at the Defense Missile Agency, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to avoid retaliation, told Federal News Network.
The memo the Navy employee received upon his termination is almost identical to the one the Defense Health Agency sent out to its fired probationary employees.
After being sworn into office, President Donald Trump signed an executive order to deploy a “next-generation missile defense shield” to protect the U.S. against aerial attacks.","When the Defense Department announced its plan to fire 5,400 probationary civilian employees, Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth emphasized that poor performance would be the main factor in determining who would be let go, saying it was simply not in the public interest to keep workers “whose contributions are not mission critical.”

“Taxpayers deserve to have us take a really thorough look at our workforce top to bottom. Common sense would tell us where we should start. We start with poor performers amongst our probationary employees. We take a little bit more time to make sure, top to bottom, we’re doing a review. Those who we need, who are the best and brightest, are going to stay. Those who are under performers won’t. We’ll continue to shoot straight with you. We’ve got your back,” Hegseth said in a message to the force and the American public on Feb. 21.

After the first round of Defense Department firings last week, the details of who was laid off — and why — are starting to emerge. Federal News Network spoke with an employee who was let go one hour before his probation period was set to end, another employee who was not in a probationary status at all, and one employee who had just started a job in warfighter support operations.

“They are just indiscriminately firing people. There are no rules to the game,” one of the fired probationary workers at the Defense Missile Agency, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to avoid retaliation, told Federal News Network.

One Navy employee, whose name is also being withheld to protect against retaliation, was one hour away from the end of his probationary period before being terminated — unlike about a dozen probationary employees in the same role across the region who were given three weeks of administrative leave.

In a memo signed by Darin Selnick, who is performing the duties of the under secretary of defense for personnel and readiness, the Navy said he “has not demonstrated that his further employment at the agency would be in the public interest.”

“What’s inequitable is that you can have 11 people, and ten of them go on three weeks administrative leave, which means that they have three weeks with a clearance that they can use to get another job. They’re getting paid. They have time to look for other jobs. I’m terminated that day. My leadership said it was discussed with the Department of Navy when they were trying to figure out how not to have to fire me. They said, “No, it happens today, because if he goes into another pay period, he’s no longer probationary, and we can’t fire him because he’s a protected veteran,” he said.

He also never received a formal performance review — he submitted self-assessments months ago, and his supervisor had completed their portion, but the commander had yet to sign off on it.

The memo the Navy employee received upon his termination is almost identical to the one the Defense Health Agency sent out to its fired probationary employees.

Firings at the Defense Health Agency

One of the fired DHA workers told Federal News Network she was not in a probationary status at all — she was hired at the beginning of 2023 as a GS-9, completed her probationary period in March 2024, and was promoted to GS-11 in August 2024.

The letter she got from HR congratulating her on her promotion last August never mentioned probationary time — her position description remained the same, but instead of assisting with certain tasks, she was now fully responsible for them.

When the DHA leadership received a list of people who were in a probationary status, she was notified her name was on the list. Her leadership got involved several times to clarify with HR that there was an error, but no action was ultimately taken to correct it.

During her time at DHA, she received an outstanding performance appraisal, along with time-off and monetary awards. But the memo she received, just like dozens of DHA workers fired that day, said that “based on your performance, you have not demonstrated that your further employment at the agency would be in the public interest.”

Defense Missile Agency layoffs

The Defense Missile Agency employee, who is a disabled veteran, had been with the organization since December — as a non-commissioned officer, he held a leadership role directly supporting the warfighters’ ability to do missile defense in theaters throughout the world.

He understood the mission intimately — the warfighters he provided support for as a civilian were the very same units he served in during his time in the military.

“I was a perfect fit for this job. I was doing really well. My supervisor was telling me I was doing really well, and if it was up to him, he would fight for me. But he was kept out of the conversation. It hurts me, because I worked extremely hard to get this position. I loved this job. The team I was on was the best team I was ever on. My supervisor was amazing, and I got fired for no reason whatsoever,” he said.

While many probationary employees were aware for some time they were on a list of those potentially facing termination, the DMA employee said there was no indication he would be laid off until he was in the HR office being told to sign documents and turn in his ID card. In fact, he was actively preparing to go on a work trip abroad prior to being fired that day.

He also never had a formal performance review — his mid-year evaluation was scheduled for the end of March.

“How are you going to let people go based off of performance if these people aren’t even being evaluated for performance? They have no indication of what their performance is other than the verbals from their supervisor. That’s not quantifiable,” he said.

The reason for his firing was to “further promote the efficiency of the federal service.”

“Even if they offer me my job back, I really don’t know if I would take it. I don’t want to subject myself or my family to that. I don’t want to put myself in a position where I could lose my job again,” he said.

After being sworn into office, President Donald Trump signed an executive order to deploy a “next-generation missile defense shield” to protect the U.S. against aerial attacks. The agency was given 60 days to come with a plan for the Iron Dome for America — it is now seeking a wide range of advanced capabilities that would require significant investment, new technology, and infrastructure.

“They’re expecting to increase the funds later this summer because of the Iron Dome for America — we were expecting that the workload was going to get massive to support this. You’re not going to be able to get all that if you just slash the workforce, because you can’t fire everybody and then quadruple the work,” the fired DMA employee said.

It is unclear how many employees have been let go so far, or when the next round of firings will take place. The department said it was preparing to reduce its civilian workforce by 5-8%.

Hauschild, MPH, Defense Health Agency-Public Health Public Affairs

Legionnaires’ disease, a severe type of pneumonia, was so named in 1976 after a Pennsylvania outbreak of a mystery illness that sickened over 200 and killed 34 in two weeks. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention identified the cause of the illness to be a particular type of bacteria. Legionella bacteria were discovered in the cooling towers of a hotel that had been used for an American Legion convention.

“The risk of Legionnaires’ disease is lower now that scientists have learned more about its cause and effective prevention tactics,” says Dr. Charles McCannon, a preventive medicine physician working for Defense Health Agency-Public Health in Aberdeen, Maryland. “While the risk is low, cases still occur.”

Outbreaks occur when two or more people are exposed to Legionella in the same place and get sick at about the same time, says McCannon. The last outbreak confirmed by the military was in 2010 at Selfridge Air National Guard Base, Michigan.

Medical monitoring for cases of communicable diseases such as Legionnaires’ disease is a public health measure that prevents larger-scale disease occurrence.

Tracking Cases in the Military

To identify potential outbreaks and prevent additional exposures to the hazardous bacteria, both the CDC and the U.S. military require medical facilities to report cases of Legionnaires’ disease.

Alexis Maule, a senior epidemiologist with the Preventive Medicine Division of DHA-PH at Aberdeen, explains that the name Legionellosis is now used to refer to both Legionnaires’ disease and Pontiac fever, a milder illness without pneumonia.

“Most people with Pontiac fever likely do not seek treatment for their illness,” says Maule. “In addition, most healthy people who are exposed to Legionella bacteria will not become ill with either Legionnaires’ disease or Pontiac fever. That means the extent of exposure may underreported, but we are identifying cases needing treatment at military medical facilities.”

Even with the expanded case definition, the military has not found Legionellosis to be a commonly reported disease. This is generally consistent with CDC findings though there are higher rates in the general population.

“In the past five years, 87 Legionellosis cases have been reported to the military’s medical reporting system, and only half of these were confirmed to be Legionnaires’ disease,” says Maule. “In addition, the disease was most frequently reported in retirees, while less than a third of reported cases were active-duty military personnel.”

Maule explains that this makes sense because age is risk factor for Legionellosis, and many retirees were noted to already have chronic medical conditions unrelated to Legionellosis, making this group more susceptible to any type of bacterial infection.

McCannon and Maule provide answers to questions about Legionellosis:

Frequently Asked Questions

Q. What is Legionellosis?

Legionellosis comprises the illnesses (Legionnaires’ disease, Pontiac fever) caused by the Legionella bacteria. Many species of Legionella bacteria can cause disease, but the presence of the bacteria in the environment or even in a clinical sample (such as urine or blood) does not mean a person is or will become ill with a disease. The majority of disease is caused by Legionella pneumophila, particularly a sub type known as serogroup 1.

Because the bacteria have the potential to cause harm (even if no clinical cases are reported), the presence of Legionella bacteria detected in a facility is considered a hazard to be remediated. Protocols have been established to ensure proper sanitation is achieved. (https://ph.health.mil/PHC Resource Library/ohs-ihf-control-of-legionella-factsheet.pdf)

Q. How does a person get sick with Legionnaires’ disease?

The primary way people are exposed is by breathing in water droplets that carry the Legionella bacteria. Less commonly, Legionella may be transmitted via aspiration of drinking water. Exposed persons who become sick do not transmit the infection to others.

While Legionella bacteria occur naturally in freshwater environments, they primarily cause disease after growing in certain human-made water systems that aerosolize water. Complex air conditioning cooling towers of large structures such as hotels, hospitals, long-term care facilities, and cruise ships are a particular concern. Water systems and air-conditioning units of private homes are generally not exposure sources. Cases have occasionally been attributed to personal hot tubs, whirlpool spas and even decorative fountains.

The CDC reports that since the 1976 outbreak, agencies around the world now have more stringent cleaning and hygiene standards for cooling towers and large-scale air-conditioning systems. But the conditions outside the U.S. may present more of a concern. (https://www.cdc.gov/legionella/infographics/legionella-affects-water-systems.pdf)

Q. What are symptoms of Legionellosis?

Legionellosis symptoms can include fever and other flu-like symptoms such as muscle aches and cough and can begin hours to several days after bacteria are inhaled. Legionnaires’ disease symptoms begin two to 14 days after exposure and can be confirmed when Legionella bacteria infect cells in the air sacs of the lung. This condition can be life-threatening, but it is treatable with antibiotics.

The symptoms of Pontiac fever develop in five hours to a few days; it is a milder illness—without pneumonia—characterized by dry cough or sore throat, fever, chills, fatigue, headache and sore muscles.

Q. How is Legionellosis diagnosed?

Diagnosis is based on clinical findings, such as signs of pneumonia identified with a chest x-ray, and medical laboratory antigen confirmation of the unique type of the bacteria, known as serotype in the patient. If environmental samples are available, they can be compared to the bacteria type found in patient samples. If the bacteria type does not match the type found at an environmental source of concern, other exposure sources are considered.

Q. Are certain people at higher risk of Legionellosis?

Most healthy people who are exposed to Legionella bacteria do not get infected with disease. Certain behaviors such as smoking, recent travel with an overnight stay outside of the home, recent care at a healthcare facility, and hot tub use are risk factors that would be considered if determining a case.

The risk of Legionellosis is higher among persons over 50 and those with chronic lung disease, immune system disorders due to disease or medication, systemic malignancy, or an underlying illness such as diabetes, renal failure, or hepatic failure. The younger, relatively healthy and vaccinated active-duty population has a lower risk for severe disease from Legionella exposure compared to the general population.

Q. Does risk of Legionellosis depend on location or time?

Within the U.S., the CDC has shown a higher number of cases of Legionellosis in the northern and mid-western states. There is some seasonality to the risk of Legionellosis, with higher risk of infection in the summer through fall months because temperate conditions allow for the growth of the bacteria. (https://www.cdc.gov/legionella/php/surveillance/surveillance-report-2018-2019.html)

Q. How is Legionellosis differentiated from other pneumonias?

Pneumonia is a generalized term for inflammation and infection of the air sacs in one or both lungs resulting in fluid in the lungs. Air sacs fill with fluid or pus, causing a productive cough with phlegm, and often fever, chills and difficulty breathing.

Pneumonia can be a symptom of many different diseases and can be caused by a range of organisms, including bacteria (such as Legionnaires’ disease and Q fever), viruses (such as COVID-19 and certain flu viruses), and fungi (such as Coccidioidomycosis [“Valley fever”]). The severity of pneumonia infection can range from mild to life-threatening. Bacterial pneumonia is usually more severe than viral pneumonia.

Pneumonia caused by Legionella bacteria is only differentiated from other pneumonias by medical tests/laboratory tests to determine the cause of the pneumonia.

Q. Does the pneumonia vaccine help against Legionellosis?

There is no vaccine against Legionellosis, and none of the available pneumococcal vaccines protect against the Legionella bacteria. However, Legionnaires’ disease shares many of the same risk factors as other pneumonias, so getting a pneumococcal vaccine, as well as a respiratory syncytial virus, or RSV, vaccine, as recommended, may reduce the risk of severe Legionnaires’ disease.

Santa Clara, CAInjured veterans and advocates are fighting medical malpractice claims denied by the Defense Health Agency because they sustained injuries while on active duty, even though active duty also includes their time in hospital. They are urging the U.S. Supreme Court to end the 70-year-old 'unhinged and incoherent' Feres doctrine which blocks military members from bringing claims against the federal government. But on February 24, 2025 the Supreme Court issued a new blow to active duty service members hoping to seek justice following cases of alleged medical malpractice caused by military doctors, nurses and other healthcare practitioners.

Veteran Ryan Carter Denied

Maryland Air National Guard Veteran Ryan Carter underwent elective spinal surgery in 2018 – he was a healthy 43-year-old and not on active duty at the time. Carter couldn’t move his extremities when he woke from surgery; he had an MRI and was rushed back to Walter Reed National Military Medical Center for a second surgery to decompress his spinal canal. Carter is now a paraplegic.

Carter’s attorney filed a petition asking the Supreme Court to hear his case but said they were “stonewalled from the get-go” because his military status was deemed “active duty” while in hospital. Carter, his wife and his attorney also asked the Supreme Court have the Feres doctrine either clarified, limited or overruled and that the 1950 Feres decision by the Court contradicts the text and purpose of the Federal Tort Claims Act (FTCA), wrongly denying military members orthodox legal remedies that Congress clearly opted to supply.

But that petition was just denied. Justice Clarence Thomas issued the only dissent opinion, saying he hoped one day the Supreme Court would overturn Feres, and that it has been almost universally condemned by judges and legal scholars. “Feres is indefensible as a matter of law, and senseless as a matter of policy,” Thomas wrote. “Had Carter been a veteran rather than an inactive reservist, he could have filed a lawsuit for the same injuries arising from the same treatment by the same military staff at the same hospital.”

Carter’s attorney told StarsandStripes.com that his case received support briefs filed by lawmakers and more than a dozen veterans organization. He will now turn his attention to an administrative claim that he filed on Carter’s behalf with the Defense Department.

Veteran Richard Stayskal Denied

An Army hospital failed to alert Green Beret Richard Stayskal to a large tumor they found on his lung in 2017. He didn’t know until months later from a doctor at a civilian hospital that he had stage 3 cancer. Military.com reported that Stayskal--after his diagnosis-- became an advocate for service members to file medical malpractice claims against the government--a process historically denied due to the Feres Doctrine (below).

Stayskal’s lung cancer changed military malpractice law and Congress created a new malpractice system called “The Sgt. First Class Richard Stayskal Military Medical Accountability Act”, which supposedly allows troops to file claims with the Defense Department alleging malpractice by military health-care providers, and allows veterans to seek damages for economic losses, pain and suffering. But it still didn’t help Stayskal.

Stayskal and his wife filed claims separately in 2021 for $20 million for pain and suffering. In 2023 his million medical malpractice claim was denied. His subsequent appeal also was denied.

“The denial of my claim by the Department of Defense, in my opinion, is a blatant act of betrayal. Not only to myself, but every service member out there,” Stayskal told StarsandStripes.com. “I stand here today on behalf of an entire generation and on behalf of future generations to ensure what happened to me will never happen again and give every breath I have for them.” Stayskal’s attorney said that “People have the right to sue if they are victims of malpractice, except for service members. It's time to stop treating them like second-class citizens. It's got to stop.” She went on. The Army told Stayskal it had ""breached standard of care"" but did not commit malpractice. The Army’s rejection letter said there was “no evidence that [Master Sgt.] Stayskal’s prognosis or chance of survival was adversely affected by the delay in the diagnosis of lung cancer.”

Stayskal, now with Stage 4 cancer, currently has no recourse to appeal his ruling. There is only one longshot: Congressman Darrell Issa and other House colleagues introduced a bill in 2023 called “The HERO Act” that would allow service members to take their medical malpractice claims to federal court. The bill has 27 sponsors but has not been considered by the House Judiciary Committee. According to Issa, “The HERO Act will grant service members who are victims of medical malpractice in a DOD medical treatment facility the right and opportunity to take their claim to District Court—the same legal process as military spouses, DOD civilians, and anyone else. It will finally reform the current failing system and replace it with one that gives our military the fair shot at justice they deserve.""

The Feres Doctrine

In a nutshell, the Feres Doctrine shields military doctors and the government from cases of alleged medical malpractice. The legal site Justia explains the Feres Doctrine: “The United States is not liable under the Federal Tort Claims Act for injuries to members of the armed forces sustained while on active duty and not on furlough and resulting from the negligence of others in the armed forces.”

Troops still aren't allowed to file lawsuits over medical malpractice under the Feres Doctrine, set by a 1950 Supreme Court decision that protected the military and its officials from liability for combat-related injuries, although family members may file claims and lawsuits in civil court under the Federal Tort Claims Act. Aside from medical claims, the Feres doctrine has also limited the ability of people to bring military rape cases to civil courts.

In May 2024, Military.com reported that the Pentagon was “tweaking its formula for calculating payments to U.S. service members for medical malpractice claims, a move that could put more money in the pockets of affected troops and veterans. In October 2023, the amount of money for noneconomic damages rose from $600,000 to $750,000. Until 2021, service members were not allowed to file claims for medical malpractice or sue the Defense Department over injuries or illnesses that occur while on active duty. Stayskal and his wife both filed $20 million claims for pain and suffering, well over the current $750,000 cap for such claims. When Stayskal’s claim was denied, he told The Washington Post that Army Secretary Christine Wormuth offered him $600,000 using her discretionary funding authority, which was the maximum amount allowed for pain and suffering damages in the military's medical malpractice system. He refused the money.

Crosland’s retirement was publicly announced Friday, but Reuters reported that the senior officer was told she must resign.
Crosland’s departure comes amid Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth’s efforts to eliminate diversity, equity, and inclusion initiatives at the Pentagon.
Last month, Hegseth said he believed that “diversity is our strength” was the “single dumbest phrase in military history.” The defense secretary also moved to end commemorations for Black History Month, Women’s History Month, and more.

On Friday (February 28), Crosland was forced to retire from her military role just a week after President Donald Trump fired the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff and other senior officers, sources told Reuters.

Crosland’s retirement was publicly announced Friday, but Reuters reported that the senior officer was told she must resign.

“I want to thank Crosland for her dedication to the nation, to the military health system, and to Army medicine for the past 32 years,” Stephen Ferrara, acting assistant secretary of defense for health affairs, said in a statement Friday.

The sources, a current and former official, said Crosland wasn’t given a reason why she had to retire. The Pentagon also declined to provide a reason why Crosland allegedly resigned.

MPIR increased to 8.42% from 1st January 2025

The Maximum Permissible Interest Rate (MPIR) increased to 8.42% effective from January 1st 2025.

As facilities proceed to increase RAD’s, the lesser profitability of a concessional resident will result in a clear preference for RAD paying residents.

The effective Refundable Accommodation Contribution (RAC) on a refurbished aged care home, above the 40% concessional ratio, will be $302,671 from 1st January 2025, which will put pressure on those looking to find a concessional placement given average RAD’s are now much higher than this amount.

The hospital cited ""temporary staffing issues"" as the reason for the initially planned reduction in ER hours.

Support from the Defense Health Agency and Navy Medicine allowed the hospital to maintain its 24/7 ER service.

Naval Hospital Jacksonville will keep its emergency room running around the clock despite earlier statements that the ER’s schedule would be cut in half, the hospital announced over the weekend.

“Naval Hospital Jacksonville remains committed to providing exceptional care to our patients and ensuring access to the services they rely on,” read a Facebook message the hospital posted Saturday.

The message said the ER was staying open “through the support of the Defense Health Agency and Navy Medicine,” an enterprise created last year that includes the 154-year-old Navy Medical Corps comprised of 4,300 active-duty and reserve physicians. The Defense Health Agency oversees both civilian and military staffs at more than 700 military medical facilities.

The hospital at Naval Air Station Jacksonville had been scheduled to change Monday to ER hours of 6 a.m. to 6 p.m. due to what Capt. Craig Malloy, its commanding officer, last week called “temporary staffing issues.”

The scaled-back hours had been projected to last into the summer.

The group has transformed its MEDIC-X training from a series of task-driven stations to interactive, adrenaline-fueled challenges -- incorporating props, prizes, and, most importantly, high-quality training.
“When you can capture people’s attention during a class or training session, there is a higher likelihood they will retain the information,” explained Air Force Master Sgt.
“The intent is to equip our medics with broad skills common to all medical specialties,” explained Air Force Maj. Gen. Thomas Harrell, director, Defense Health Network Central, and commander, Medical Readiness Command Alpha.
“MEDIC-X will play a critical role as our great nation prepares for Great Power Competition,” said Air Force Col. Maria Bussie, 49 MDG commander.","HOLLOMAN AIR FORCE BASE, New Mexico -- The 49th Medical Group is taking medical readiness training to the next level to enhance military medics’ ability to deliver lifesaving care on the battlefield.

The group has transformed its MEDIC-X training from a series of task-driven stations to interactive, adrenaline-fueled challenges -- incorporating props, prizes, and, most importantly, high-quality training.

“When you can capture people’s attention during a class or training session, there is a higher likelihood they will retain the information,” explained Air Force Master Sgt. Shelby Vande Zande, 49th Healthcare Operations Squadron primary care flight chief and the group’s alternate 4N functional manager. “That was ultimately the goal when setting up the program -- provide quality training and retention of skills.”

The Air Force launched the MEDIC-X program in 2024 to enhance medical Airmen’s ability to provide basic clinical support to warfighters. The program trains medics, including those not involved in patient care, such as administrators or laboratory technicians, to be proficient in 52 lifesaving skills spanning 13 clinical categories.

“The intent is to equip our medics with broad skills common to all medical specialties,” explained Air Force Maj. Gen. Thomas Harrell, director, Defense Health Network Central, and commander, Medical Readiness Command Alpha. “Clinical providers and nurses may be limited on the battlefield; this initiative enhances our ability to deliver safe, high-quality care to our warfighters in any strategic environment.”

Incorporating a mix of classroom and hands-on training, Airmen practice skills such as IV fluid management, oxygen therapy, vital signs, dressing changes, and on- and off-loading patients from fixed-wing aircraft.

Rather than adhere to the traditional training modules and to enhance skills retention, the 49 MDG transformed training into a series of challenges with teams competing to earn the prestigious title of MEDIC-X Module Winner.

“At the inception of the training, we brainstormed the different ways that we could deliver the training that would result in a meaningful outcome while keeping the training interesting,” Vande Zande said.

Capt. Natasha Lindblom, 49 MDG Education and Training Flight commander, said creativity and fun were key to the brainstorming process. “If training is not engaging, it’s more easily forgotten,” she said.

One recent challenge tested Airmen’s ability to feed patients under challenging circumstances. The patient in the scenario wore “drunk glasses” to make their vision blurry, while a teammate fed the patient three spoons of pudding with the aim of not spilling a drop.

“It was great practice for situations where feeding a patient in distress may be needed,” Lindblom explained. “There was certainly a fair amount of pudding spilled.”

Another challenge tested Airmen’s ability to measure a patient’s fluid input and output, which is critical in ensuring fluid imbalance doesn’t impact patients’ stability. Using a chest atrium, foley bag, and syringe for output, as well as a cup of ice, glass of water, and unit of fake blood for input, the team had to measure fluid input and output, correspond the amounts to a number-to-letter chart, then spell out a word that unlocked a lock and revealed a small prize.

“All the while we had volunteers from the line side present yelling and making menacing sounds,” Lindblom said. “The challenge really got their adrenaline going. I was impressed at how many people remembered that 100 ml of ice is equal to 50 ml of fluid.”

“When we are in an austere environment performing these tasks, it will be stressful, and when people are stressed, they may make mistakes,” she added. “Practice is key to performing well under pressure.”

The winning teams receive a small prize, such as a hand-crocheted liver or gallbladder, courtesy of Lindblom. The prizes are small, but participants walk away with a sense of pride and achievement, she said.

The engaging format has received a positive reception, said Senior Airman Claire Pruitt, 49 MDG Education and Training Flight.

“Making MEDIC-X an enjoyable learning experience helps students stay more motivated, absorb the information more effectively, and develop the confidence needed to apply their knowledge in real-world scenarios,” she said. “I love being able to see our hard work make others smile and keep them engaged in an ever-evolving field.”

MEDIC-X is beneficial not only for Airmen, but for the clinical providers on scene, Lindblom noted.

“If I can have non-clinical Airmen measuring inputs and outputs, then nurses can administer medications, hang IVs, do all of the things that nurses need to do,” she said. “Clinical personnel can focus on their tasks and the non-clinical Airmen can take care of the rest, especially when in a situation where prolonged field care is needed.”

Vande Zande said she saw the impact of the MEDIC-X program firsthand during a recent mass casualty exercise. “Our providers, nurses, and medical technicians were overrun with patients, and a lab tech and an admin tech stepped in to assist with providing ventilations and wound treatment to the patients,” she said. “Suddenly, our manpower team was far more than security and patient movement. Having the basic skills necessary to step in during an emergency is invaluable to the team as a whole and does nothing but benefit the patient.”

This collaborative approach strengthens teamwork and ensures Airmen are prepared for the unexpected.

“MEDIC-X will play a critical role as our great nation prepares for Great Power Competition,” said Air Force Col. Maria Bussie, 49 MDG commander. “It enables clinical personnel to take care of casualties without having to worry about dividing their time and energies amongst many. It could be the difference between life and death for one of our warfighters.”

Harrell, one of the architects of the MEDIC-X program, praised the 49 MDG’s creative efforts to enhance medical readiness training.

“In a deployed setting, our medics will be called on to provide potentially lifesaving care and support, and they need to be able to do so confidently and deliberately,” Harrell said. “The 49 MDG’s innovative approach to MEDIC-X is a prime example of how leadership is harnessing ingenuity to ensure medical readiness and the delivery of exceptional care to our warfighters in any combat setting, no matter how austere or remote.”",https://d1ldvf68ux039x.cloudfront.net/thumbs/photos/2503/8905127/1000w_q95.jpg,N,1.0,2025-03-09 18:50:22.370749

The addition of this advanced training tool underscores the hospital’s commitment to improving neonatal care and aligns with ongoing efforts by Navy Medicine and the Defense Health Agency (DHA) to enhance medical readiness and patient outcomes. Mrs. Katia Arico, the command’s Staff Education and Training Coordinator and Trainer, led the year-long planning and procurement of the RQI for NRP Skills Station.

Hospital staff from across departments gathered for a lively celebration, themed as a baby shower, to mark the arrival of the innovative simulator. The event featured a range of activities, including games and prizes, with the staff actively participating in a poll to name the new neonatal manikin. The winning name, NOAH—an acronym for Neonatal Outcomes And Healthcare—was chosen as a symbol of the hospital’s dedication to improving neonatal care through cutting-edge training technology.

The new RQI simulator offers significant value to the hospital’s training program by helping healthcare providers maintain and improve their neonatal resuscitation skills. With NRP renewal training required every two years, the gap between training sessions can often lead to skill degradation. The use of simulation provides an effective solution to this challenge, enabling clinicians to repeatedly practice critical skills, sustain knowledge, and maintain proficiency.

The simulator, designed to replicate real-life neonatal resuscitation scenarios, enables healthcare providers to practice essential techniques, such as positive pressure ventilation, with real-time feedback. Key metrics, including mask seal, ventilation rate, and pressure, are monitored to guide improvements in clinical performance. The staff will utilize the simulator on a quarterly basis to practice the skills required to get newborn babies breathing in the critical first minutes after birth.

U.S. NMRTC/ NH Sigonella ensures maximum readiness by providing high-quality, safe patient and family-centered care to NATO and transient DoD forces in the U.S. Fifth Fleet and U.S. Sixth Fleet areas of operation and delivers an average of 50 babies per year. While the volume may be lower than larger hospitals, the importance of maintaining proficiency in high-risk neonatal scenarios remains paramount. The hospital’s healthcare professionals are called to manage neonatal resuscitations, which demand not only advanced knowledge but also immediate, precise action. “Our team is exceptional in providing care, but we know that high-risk scenarios, while rare, can be life-altering when they occur,” said Cmdr. (Dr.) Sebastian Lara, the sole Pediatrician at the hospital. “That’s why RQI for NRP is so important. It allows our staff to stay current with the latest neonatal resuscitation techniques and ensures that we are ready to respond effectively when it matters most.”

This initiative aligns with the Navy Surgeon General’s call for healthcare teams to remain agile and competent in a broad spectrum of clinical situations, even in low-volume settings. Lt. Cmdr. Brandi Gibson, the command’s NRP Program Director, shared her thoughts on the new system. “With such a low delivery volume, it’s easy to feel out of practice when we encounter a complicated birth. RQI has given our staff the ability to practice the most important neonatal resuscitation skills regularly, so when we do face a difficult situation, we are confident and ready to act.”

The hospital’s commitment to safety and readiness also aligns with the Navy’s broader mission of providing comprehensive healthcare services to military personnel and their families, no matter where they are stationed. In an environment where resources are sometimes limited and the stakes are high, maintaining a culture of excellence is essential. As Cmdr. Lara concluded, “We may not face a high volume of complicated deliveries, but when they do occur, we want to be ready. RQI for NRP ensures that we have the skills and knowledge to provide the best care possible and live up to the trust our patients place in us every day.”

The successful launch of the RQI for NRP program at U.S. NMRTC/NH Sigonella is a testament to the dedication of military medical personnel in upholding the highest standards of care, readiness, and patient safety. Through this initiative, the hospital continues to foster a culture of continuous improvement while ensuring that its staff is prepared for the most challenging and critical situations, both in peacetime and in the line of duty.",https://d1ldvf68ux039x.cloudfront.net/thumbs/photos/2503/8904905/1000w_q95.jpg,N,0.0,2025-03-09 12:50:26.028265
