Readiness, the most important discipline in military medicine, is what the patient needs in critical moments. In times of war, wounded combatant care typically leads to surgery, which is why improving operating room efficiency is critical to readiness.

When I reflect on my almost 20 years of service in the Military Health System , readiness always comes to my mind first. Competent surgical staff are force multipliers in combat zones. However, many factors beyond readiness—such as surgical equipment sterile processing, patient acuity, patient demand, quality and safety, and budget–impact how we deliver care in our current environments. This makes it challenging to prove what surgeons, nurses, and anesthesiologists need to be ""ready.”

While one size does not always fit all, I believe there is a size that fits most. Every military hospital or clinic’s mission varies based on their specializations, outside factors, and size. But the main thing their missions have in common is readiness. If we direct the right tools, processes, and staff into place, we can and will increase overall OR efficiency–and most importantly, increase readiness.

OR Optimization

Directly related to this, the Defense Health Agency stood up the OR Optimization Project in late 2022 to enhance the way ORs function across surgical military hospitals and clinics.

This initiative focuses on optimizing perioperative processes and creating standardized practices to increase staff readiness, improve patient care, and generate financial savings. The effort aims to reduce delays, improve communication among surgical teams, and make ORs overall more efficient by staffing the correct number of people, thus lowering operational costs. By creating standardized metrics and peer groups, ORs across the MHS will be evaluated on a common scale with respect to military hospitals and clinics with similar characteristics.

Through this effort, the DHA established the OR Executive Steering Committee, or ORESC, which acts as a centralized decision-making body to standardize perioperative processes across the MHS. The DHA ORESC includes practicing surgeons, nurses, and anesthesiologists from all nine Defense Health Networks who bring knowledge from the field to codify unified, high-quality standards for perioperative services across all military hospitals or clinics.

These members are dedicated to improving perioperative care and readiness outside of their daily work in the OR. We need practicing perioperative staff to pressure test the policies that are put into place. I am a practicing surgeon, which is crucial to my role in the committee.

OR Achievements

As the acting chair of the DHA ORESC, I am proud of the progress that this committee has made to date. Since its inception, the DHA ORESC has reviewed, voted on, and proposed eight policies:

1. OR Scheduling and Surgical Block Management Policy: Optimizes OR utilization through standardized surgical scheduling and block-management practices

2. OR Staffing Standards: Establishes a standardized staffing model to determine number of ORs to run and staffing to meet OR needs

3. OR Performance Metrics: Develops standardized OR metrics, targets, calculations, peer groups, and reporting levels across the MHS

4. OR Throughput Standard Operating Procedure: Revises OR processes to improve First Case On-Time Start rates and reduce Turnover Time

5. Sterile Processing Department Loaner Policy: Standardizes workflows for reprocessing and utilizing vendor medical instrumentation

6. Pre-Surgical Testing SOP: Optimizes PST processes to reduce OR cancellations within one business day of surgery and prevent delays

7. Day of Surgery /Pre-Operative Processes SOP: Optimizes DOS processes to prevent delays and/or cancellations on the DOS, improve FCOT rates, and decrease pre-operative length of stay.

8. DHN-Level ORESC Charter: Lays the foundation for perioperative decision-making bodies to be stood up at the DHN-level, as able.

By documenting the gold standard for all ORs, the DHA ORESC helps the MHS deliver safe and high-quality care to beneficiaries.

There are still innumerable areas that the DHA ORESC needs to touch.

I am particularly proud of the first of its kind DHA Enterprise Staffing Model that was developed from the DHA ORESC proposed OR staffing standards. The model establishes a baseline staffing need at each military hospital and clinic to run day-to-day ORs with a Perioperative Staffing Calculator that can be used to determine the number of ORs a facility can run based on current staffing. Perioperative staff will be able to leverage the calculator with their leadership to explain what staff is needed to meet patient demand efficiently and effectively. The outputs will provide that gold standard we are looking for and should continuously work toward.

Looking Forward

I am excited to see the hard work from the OR Optimization Project coming to fruition, and I recognize it will take time to implement these initiatives across the MHS. You cannot turn up the gas on the OR immediately, as there are a lot of steps. When working with the ORs, a phased-implementation approach to standardizing ORs is crucial as there is real risk and reward. Surgery is not an easy endeavor. Metrics should not necessarily be confused with performance, as safety is always the top priority.

The best way I have gained insights and what I encourage MHS leadership–both perioperative and non-perioperative – to do is to physically go into the OR space to see what is happening and how the first steps toward standardization can take place.

Feedback from staff and beneficiaries will play a key role in fine-tuning the new processes, as they are implemented across surgical facilities. Ultimately, beneficiaries will likely see fewer delays and cancellations as perioperative processes become more efficient. Providers will benefit from clearer workflows, better communication, and reduced administrative burdens.

The DHA remains committed to improving outcomes and ensuring the readiness of our healthcare system.

It wasn’t an unusual request for Nogee, the chief of the consultation department at USAMRICD’s Chemical Casualty Care Division. However, this call turned out not to be the usual fare.

On the other end of the phone was an officer from a special operations unit calling from a live training exercise, seeking advice on medical planning and logistics for a particular type of chemical casualty that they were training on at that very moment.

“Often, we'll be contacted in advance to schedule a call and provide us with information in advance to help us prepare,” says Nogee. “But this was a totally out of the blue; we weren't expecting it. It’s a lot more exciting to get an unplanned call where we have to think on our feet a bit more and rely on the resources we have on hand.”

Nogee, Boehm, and their USAMRICD colleagues who responded were able to get the caller the information they needed, enabling them to plan the best possible course of action for the exercise scenario they faced. Not only did their timely response demonstrate USAMRICD’s operational readiness and contributions to Warfighter lethality and survivability, but it also highlights a unique way that the institute’s chemical casualty care experts provide real-time telemedicine consultations to deployed caregivers around the world 24 hours a day, seven days a week.

The assistance they provided is typical of the types of questions that come to USAMRICD through the Advanced Virtual Support for Operational Forces telemedicine consultation system, nicknamed ADVISOR. Operated by the Defense Health Agency’s Virtual Medical Center, ADVISOR provides on-demand urgent medical, surgical, and dental consultation services to active duty, DOD, and government caregivers in operational settings. By providing real-time support and information to health care providers and leadership, ADVISOR facilitates informed decision-making and improves the provision of patient care in complex operational environments.

USAMRICD is one of two Defense Health Agency Research & Development-Medical Research and Development Command organizations that participate in ADVISOR. The other is the U.S. Army Institute of Surgical Research, which co-founded ADVISOR’s predecessor consultation service that was established to support special operations forces.

“The ADVISOR line is the highest profile and highest priority way for us to conduct our consultation mission of answering clinical and operational questions about chemical casualty care,” says Nogee. “It’s also a great way for us to fulfill our training and education mission as well.”

USAMRICD is renowned for its in-residence and offsite courses in chemical incident preparation and response, which it offers in conjunction with the U.S. Army Medical Research Institute of Infectious Diseases to first responders, medical practitioners, and hospital executives. The courses have been called the gold standard in training for medical management of chemical, biological, radiation, and nuclear casualties. When working with clients via the ADVISOR hotline who are planning a chemical casualty training event, USAMRICD invites them to take advantage of their courses to improve the fidelity of the training experience. Nogee says that this outreach has measurably increased the number of people taking the courses – thereby materially improving the readiness, adaptability, and resilience of the joint force.

An unexpected benefit of the ADVISOR hotline is that it also allows innovative ideas to flow into USAMRICD as well. Nogee recalls how a recent “out of the blue” call led to a series of discussions that eventually resulted in a new course on the advanced pharmacy management of CBRN casualties. The course was well received, and USAMRICD is working on a second iteration that can be offered more widely.

“We love calls like that, because they lead to a lot more work and business down the line,” says Nogee. “That one phone call benefitted dozens of people who attended the course, which in turn could benefit dozens of people who they end up treating. The benefits multiply pretty rapidly.”

Boehm, a field medical education specialist at USAMRICD, says that in addition to benefitting military readiness and leading to improved training outcomes, the ADVISOR service also has personal rewards for responders as well.

“I had one call that for me will always be a career highlight,” says Boehm. “We provided assistance to a unit while they were preparing for deployment and while they were on the deployment, and when they came back, they shared with us stories of how the help we provided had benefitted them. It was nice to hear right from the source that what we do matters. That call will always be something that I take with me.”",https://d1ldvf68ux039x.cloudfront.net/thumbs/photos/2506/9106978/1000w_q95.jpg,N,0.0,2025-06-12 20:58:04.245009

""Where the National Guard and reserves become a critical component of how we secure that homeland.""","Thousands of National Guard soldiers deployed in Los Angeles are waiting on pay and benefits because of delays in paperwork authorizing their activation.

President Donald Trump sent roughly 4,000 Guard members into LA to respond to protests against ICE enforcement operations, but more than a dozen troops across four units have yet to receive the official paperwork activating their duty status, according to a Military.com report. Without those orders, soldiers are not eligible for pay, health care under Tricare, or VA benefits.

Defense officials acknowledged that the sudden scale of the deployment has overwhelmed normal administrative channels. While backpay is expected once the paperwork catches up, the delay is already causing anxiety among troops juggling personal finances and family responsibilities.

Some part-time Guardsmen said they left higher-paying civilian jobs without knowing how much they would earn or whether they would qualify for housing allowances — which can range from $3,000 to $5,000 per month in the LA area, depending on rank.

Service members also described poor living conditions, including sleeping on cots outdoors and irregular access to food and fuel. The mission, expected to last 60 days, is estimated to cost taxpayers $134 million, according to Pentagon officials.

""You sent your troops here without fuel, food, water or a place to sleep,"" California Governor Gavin Newsom, who has vocally opposed the deployment of federal forces, wrote on X. ""If anyone is treating our troops disrespectfully, it is you.""

One Guard officer, speaking anonymously, said morale was suffering. Typically, the Guard is deployed into communities to provide aid and is in turn, bolstered by donations from businesses and restaurants. ""This is a situation [where] we're against the community,"" the officer told Military.com.

Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth defended the mission in a House budget hearing on Tuesday, hinting at an increased reliance on domestic National Guard deployment.

Kimberly Humphrey, of Virginia Beach, Va., pleaded guilty Tuesday in U.S. District Court in Albany to one count of wire fraud and one count of health care fraud. Humphrey was executive vice president for Roglieri's Albany-based firm, Prime Capital Ventures, a loan brokerage that held itself out as a private equity fund.

Humphrey is the second Roglieri associate to plead guilty in the case. The other is Christopher Snyder, the former chief operating officer of Prime Capital Ventures, who in May pleaded guilty to one count of conspiracy to commit wire fraud. Federal prosecutors say Humphrey and Snyder are brother and sister.

Humphrey is accused in court filings of defrauding the federal government with Medicaid and Tricare, a health care program that serves the U.S. military, through two pharmacies she operated. The wire fraud charge she pleaded guilty to is tied to loan activities related to Prime Capital Ventures and misappropriating loan customer deposits dating back to 2022.

Roglieri has been in jail since being arrested one year ago as part of the investigation into his business dealings at Prime Capital Ventures. The commercial loan brokerage firm was based in Albany before it was shut down along with several other businesses Roglieri used to own.

He is currently facing five wire fraud charges related to a 2023 loan agreement gone bad involving a group of investors looking to build a $100 million egg farm in Minnesota. Roglieri is accused of stealing a $5 million cash deposit provided to his firm as part of the deal and using it to pay for luxury items, legal fees and to repay another client. Federal prosecutors are expecting to file additional charges in the coming weeks that are likely to add to Roglieri's legal woes. He is being represented by a team of public defenders.

Roglieri has maintained his innocence, and in court filings, Roglieri's attorneys have asserted that Roglieri had been defrauded by other firms that promised to provide him with capital to fund the promised loans. Prosecutors have alleged that Roglieri was involved in a Ponzi scheme where he was taking money from new loan clients to repay older customers.

Tried and true ways of helping dry mouth If you’re concerned about the effects of dry mouth, there are plenty of options to help!","JUNE 12, 2025 – Mouth taping is the practice of using surgical tape to keep your mouth closed during sleep. It’s recently gained popularity as a potential solution for mouth breathing and its related health issues. But is it supported by science or is it just another viral trend?

Why mouth taping has gained popularity

Supporters of mouth taping claim it can address several problems caused by mouth breathing during sleep. These range from improved immunity to curing sleep apnea, a common sleep disorder resulting in your breathing repeatedly stopping and starting during sleep.

According to mouth tape-advocates, here are some of the potential oral health benefits of mouth taping:

Dry mouth prevention: Breathing through the mouth evaporates saliva, leaving your mouth dry and open to a variety of problems. These include bad breath and an increased risk of cavities and gum disease. This inhibits saliva’s protective function on your oral health.

Snoring and sleep apnea: The idea here is mouth taping helps prevent snoring and keeps sleep apnea from worsening.

Important considerations and potential risks

While the benefits of mouth taping may sound appealing, it’s important to consider any potential risks. These may include:

Difficulty breathing: If you have a stuffy nose, allergies, a deviated septum, or any other condition that makes it difficult to breathe through your nose, mouth taping could lead to difficulty breathing.

Skin irritation: The tape itself can cause skin irritation, redness, or even allergic reactions around the mouth.

Sleep disruption: Feeling like you can’t open your mouth can cause anxiety or even a panic attack. Discomfort or difficulty breathing can also disrupt sleep.

The CDC hasn’t issued a statement promoting or discouraging mouth taping. Douglas Elsesser, a program analyst with the Dental Program Branch of the TRICARE Health Plan at the Defense Health Agency, advised those interested in the benefits of mouth taping to instead “focus on addressing the root causes of mouth breathing.”

When it comes to mouth taping, here are some things to consider:

Seek professional medical advice: Mouth taping isn’t a treatment for diagnosed sleep apnea. Make sure you’re seeking treating from a professional.

Seek scientific evidence: Some small studies suggest potential benefits of mouth taping on mild sleep apnea. More research is required to confirm any benefits and the safety of mouth taping.

If you’re considering mouth taping, talk to your dentist or your medical doctor first. They’ll be able to talk with you about what’ll work best for you. They may also refer you to a sleep specialist.

Tried and true ways of helping dry mouth

If you’re concerned about the effects of dry mouth, there are plenty of options to help! The CDC recommends drinking plenty of water and chewing sugarless gum. Ensure you also avoid smoking cigarettes, using tobacco products, and drinking alcohol.",https://www.militaryspot.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/mouth-taping.png,N,0.0,2025-06-12 20:58:50.097797

Army Maj. Natalia H. Cardona, Army Clinical Psychology Residency Col. John D. Roscelli Award: This award recognizes the outstanding SAUSHEC program director.","SAN ANTONIO, Texas, June 12, 2025 – The San Antonio Uniformed Services Health Education Consortium celebrated military medical professionals during a graduation ceremony June 6 at the Scottish Rite Auditorium, downtown San Antonio.

The ceremony honored 250 residents and fellows from 58 diverse physician and allied health specialty programs. SAUSHEC is the organization responsible for military graduate medical education and graduate allied health education in San Antonio with two major training sites at Brooke Army Medical Center and the 59th Medical Wing.

""It’s been a long road,” said Dr. Mark True, SAUSHEC dean. “If you count all the way back through all of the school, even back to kindergarten, your training years total up to 24 to 28 years.”

True reminded the graduates that they are ready for independent practice.

“You are now the authority for the care you provide to your patients and with this authority comes great responsibility,” True said. “We know you will rise excellently to this occasion.”

The dean also praised the instructors for their efforts. “I’d like to take a moment to acknowledge that our graduates would not be able to walk across this stage without the tireless efforts of our program directors and our faculty, and also our program coordinators.”

True told the graduates that their instructors would continue to guide and support them as they move forward in their careers.

“I want you to know that these program directors and faculty are not going away to be a remnant of your past,” True said. “They all remain committed to you as you move forward in your careers. Dial a mentor is a real thing, and I encourage you to stay connected.”

Air Force Capt. Jareatha Abdul Raheem said she chose a career in military medicine because of her family’s strong ties to the military.

“My mom, uncles and grandfather all served,” she said. “Growing up in a military family gave me deep insight into the unique challenges and needs military families face, especially military children. I felt drawn to medicine as a way to directly address these unique healthcare needs and give back to the community that shaped me.”

Abdul Raheem chose pediatrics because it allows her to support families at “foundational moments” and partner with them in promoting lifelong health.

“From a young age, I understood how powerful it can be when a physician earns a family's trust — my own family, initially skeptical of healthcare, was transformed by the kindness and clarity of a pediatrician who took the time to listen and explain,” she said. “That moment stayed with me and ultimately shaped my desire to be the kind of physician who meets families where they are.”

“Military pediatrics deepens this calling,” Abdul Raheem said. “I am drawn to the opportunity to care for children navigating not only developmental milestones but also the challenges of frequent relocations, disrupted continuity, and fragmented care across states and countries. The ability to build trust, foster resilience, and extend care globally is why I chose this field and why I find it endlessly meaningful.”

“My residency at SAUSHEC has been incredibly rewarding and transformative,” she added. “I am deeply grateful for the friendships, mentorship, grit, and professional growth I've experienced here, and look forward to continuing my journey to improve healthcare for military families.”

The keynote speaker at the graduation was retired Lt. Gen. (Dr.) Robert Miller, the associate vice president and director of the Military Health Institute, University of Texas Health San Antonio. Miller was the Surgeon General for the Air Force and Space Force prior to retiring after serving 39 years in the military.

“It truly is my honor to be here today,” Miller said as he congratulated the graduates and welcomed their families. “Enjoy every moment and know how important you are to the Military Health System,” he said.

The former surgeon general shared three key lessons that he said were very important to him.

“Number one, enjoy every step of this amazing journey,” Miller said. “Every day is a good day, just some days are better than others. I really think that’s true.”

Miller also encouraged the graduates to learn about their service culture and what makes the military special.

The second thing was to be a “continuous learner.”

“That’s the beauty of the Military Health System, you have options,” Miller said. “Some of you may stay clinical and we need you to do that, some of you may go leadership, some of you may want to do research and development, education and training; it doesn't matter, but you have those opportunities, and you can go back and forth. So, the bottom-line is don't close any doors, burn any bridges, keep all opportunities open.”

Miller said the third lesson was the most important of all – “family comes first.”

“I believe that with all my heart, because we ask a lot of each of you to live by the core values, and that's 24-7, and it's not just when you're at work, and it's not just when you're in uniform,” he said. “Behind all of that is family. That is the family that you work with, but even more importantly, it's the family at home.”

“Know that I'm very proud of each of you,” Miller concluded. “I wish you all the very best, and once again, I cannot stress enough how important you are to our country, the future of the DOD, the future of the Military Health System. What you do matters.”

Along with the graduation certificates, several awards were presented during the ceremony.

Jimmie Mathews, Nathan Mathews and Amber Delger were sentenced for their roles in a conspiracy to commit health care fraud against TRICARE, the health care program that covers health benefits for members of the U.S. Armed Forces military personnel, retirees and their dependents. Jimmie and Nathan owned Stars & Stripes Therapy (Stars & Stripes) in 2020 and in 2016, Jimmie and Delger owned Emerald Therapy Services (Emerald Lane). Both companies were massage therapy providers and claimed to treat TRICARE beneficiaries, receiving payments from the Defense Health Agency for those services.

In 2018, the three defendants conspired together to submit false and fraudulent claims to TRICARE for services they did not complete. Documents alleged the defendants scheduled numerous appointments for TRICARE beneficiaries. If the beneficiary couldn’t make the appointment or stopped attending the appointments all together, the defendants would continue billing TRICARE as if the beneficiaries received care. Emerald Lane additionally billed TRICARE using the National Provider Identity number of numerous occupational therapists long after they stopped working for the business. In total, Emerald Lane and Stars & Stripes billed more than $7 million to TRICARE and received nearly $3 million in reimbursement.

Throughout the investigation, OIS auditors supported the investigation using claim data and evaluated outliers found in the data. The team provided an overview in in-person meetings and compared office closures and doctor availability dates to claimed service provided dates and analyzed bank statements.",https://media.defense.gov/2023/Nov/24/2003346718/1920/1080/0/281123-D-DV043-001.JPG,N,0.0,2025-06-12 20:59:05.835103
