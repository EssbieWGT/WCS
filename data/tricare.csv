Introduction to Tricare Mental Health Providers

Tricare mental health treatment centers play a vital role in supporting the mental health and well-being of active duty service members, veterans, National Guard members, and their families. As part of the broader military health system, Tricare provides comprehensive mental health care coverage for eligible individuals, ensuring access to necessary services through approved providers and facilities. Tricare offers a range of mental health programs designed to meet diverse needs, and these programs are structured to be affordable for beneficiaries.

Mental health is a critical component of overall health, particularly for service members facing the unique stressors of military life. Tricare ensures that beneficiaries can receive medically necessary care for a wide range of behavioral and emotional symptoms, from anxiety and depression to PTSD and substance use issues. The benefit of Tricare mental health coverage is that it helps improve health and wellness outcomes for those who need support. Care is tailored to each person’s unique needs, ensuring individualized and effective treatment.

Understanding Tricare Mental Health Coverage

Tricare mental health benefits cover a wide range of services for eligible beneficiaries. Whether you’re an active duty service member, a family member, or a retiree, Tricare offers access to mental health providers through both military hospitals and civilian clinics within the network.

Covered services may include:

Therapy and counseling sessions

Psychiatric evaluations

Medication management

Inpatient hospitalization for severe symptoms

Partial hospitalization and intensive outpatient programs

Substance use disorder treatment

Emergency care during mental health crises

Beneficiaries can determine which services are right for them with the help of their provider. You are encouraged to learn more about your mental health care options under TRICARE.

Care is provided through Tricare-authorized providers, including community-based professionals, clinics, and military health system facilities. Providers offer availability for appointments, and it is easy to request an appointment with a provider. The Military Health System website also provides helpful links to additional information and enrollment resources.

How Tricare Beneficiaries Access Care

To access mental health care under Tricare, most beneficiaries must start by contacting their primary care manager (PCM). The PCM may provide a referral or pre authorization for mental health services, especially if specialty care or inpatient hospitalization is required.

Active duty service members typically require a referral from their primary care provider to access services outside a military treatment facility. Tricare Prime enrollees also need referrals and authorizations, while Tricare Select participants can often seek care directly but may experience higher out of pocket costs.

Eligible Tricare beneficiaries include:

Active duty service members

National Guard and Reserve members

Retired military personnel

Family members and dependents

Individuals with Medicare and Tricare dual eligibility

Beneficiaries may need to file a claim for reimbursement when receiving mental health care or prescriptions outside their usual location or network. The availability of specific TRICARE mental health services can vary by locations, so it is important to check which services are offered in your area.

Note: Some services may require a referral or pre authorization, and claim procedures may differ depending on your plan and where you receive care.

Finding Authorized Providers

Finding the right mental health provider is a crucial step for Tricare beneficiaries seeking quality mental health care. To make this process easier, Tricare offers several resources designed to connect service members, families, and retirees with authorized providers in their area.

The TRICARE Find a Doctor tool is a user-friendly online resource that allows you to search for mental health providers by location, specialty, or name. Using this tool helps ensure that you select a provider within the Tricare network, which can significantly reduce your out of pocket costs for mental health services. Staying within the network is especially important for active duty service members and their families, as it helps keep health care costs manageable and ensures full access to covered benefits.

In addition to the online search tool, you can contact your primary care manager (PCM) or visit your local military hospital for personalized recommendations. Your PCM is familiar with your health history and can guide you to the most appropriate mental health care resources, whether you need therapy, medication management, or specialized services.

The Military Health System website also provides a comprehensive list of authorized providers and additional resources to help you navigate your mental health care options. When choosing a provider, consider factors such as the provider’s location, availability for appointments, and area of specialty to ensure you receive the best possible care for your needs.

By using these resources and working closely with your primary care manager, you can access high-quality mental health care while keeping your out of pocket costs as low as possible. Whether you are seeking support for yourself or a family member, Tricare’s network of providers is designed to support the health and well-being of military families at every stage of life.

Types of Mental Health Services Covered by Tricare

Tricare covers both inpatient and outpatient mental health services, depending on the severity of the symptoms and the clinical recommendations of your provider.

Inpatient Hospitalization: For individuals in need of round-the-clock supervision or treatment for severe psychiatric conditions, Tricare covers inpatient hospitalization. This includes stays in both military hospitals and civilian psychiatric facilities when authorized.

Inpatient Mental Health Facilities:

Tricare covers inpatient mental health treatment for individuals experiencing acute psychiatric symptoms that require 24/7 care in a secure and structured environment. This level of care is provided at authorized military or civilian facilities and includes crisis stabilization, medication management, and intensive therapeutic support.

Partial Hospitalization Program (PHP):

Tricare covers partial hospitalization programs for individuals who need intensive mental health care during the day but do not require overnight stays. PHP offers structured therapy, medication management, and support services in a clinical setting, typically lasting several hours a day, five days a week.

Intensive Outpatient Program (IOP):

Tricare also covers intensive outpatient programs, which provide a step-down level of care from PHP. IOP includes multiple weekly therapy sessions, group counseling, and access to psychiatric support, allowing patients to receive treatment while continuing to live at home and manage daily responsibilities.

Outpatient Therapy and Counseling: Ongoing therapy is a key part of mental health recovery. Tricare mental health treatment centers offer individual, group, and family therapy sessions, covering a variety of therapeutic approaches for children, teens, and adults. Therapy and medication are often used together to treat mental health conditions, with treatment plans tailored to each individual’s needs.

Substance Use Treatment: Tricare also covers medically necessary treatment for substance use disorders. This includes detox services, residential programs, and outpatient counseling to address co-occurring disorders and support long-term recovery. There are no longer limits on the number of counseling sessions or treatments that can be accessed within a single week.

Medication Management and Prescription Drugs: Mental health care often includes the use of prescription drugs. Medications may be prescribed by mental health providers when medically appropriate. Tricare provides coverage through military pharmacies, retail network pharmacies, and mail-order options. Patients can access prescriptions at lower costs by using in-network or military pharmacies whenever possible.

Costs, Benefits, and Access

The costs associated with Tricare mental health treatment centers vary depending on your plan and enrollment status. Tricare Prime typically offers the lowest out of pocket costs, while Tricare Select may include cost-sharing requirements. TRICARE helps pay for mental health services and prescription drugs, reducing the financial burden for eligible beneficiaries.

Key cost-saving features include:

Coverage for preventive mental health services

Access to military providers at no cost

Use of network pharmacies to reduce prescription costs

Sliding scale payments in some clinics for family members and children

Additionally, Tricare covers therapy for various age groups and life stages, from children to seniors, helping individuals and families navigate challenges at every phase of life. When accessing TRICARE mental health services, beneficiaries can be assured that their personal health information is kept secure and confidential.

Emergency Care and Crisis Support

In cases of psychiatric emergencies, Tricare covers emergency care without prior authorization. If a service member or family member is experiencing severe symptoms or is in danger of harming themselves or others, they should seek care immediately. Emergency room visits for mental health reasons are covered when deemed medically necessary.

Following emergency treatment, the individual may be referred to a Tricare mental health treatment center for continued care, support, and monitoring.

Tricare and VA or Medicare Integration

Many veterans and military retirees are eligible for both Medicare and Tricare. When dual coverage is in place, Tricare often serves as secondary insurance, covering costs not paid by Medicare.

Similarly, individuals receiving care through the VA may also be eligible for Tricare support, especially if additional mental health services are needed outside the VA system. Coordination between the VA, Tricare, and military hospitals helps ensure comprehensive, uninterrupted care.

Resources and Family Support Services

Tricare mental health care is not limited to individual treatment. Recognizing the importance of family in recovery, Tricare mental health treatment centers often include family counseling, parenting support, and behavioral health education programs.

Resources for families include:

Support groups for spouses and children

Parenting workshops

Counseling for deployment-related stress

Assistance for families living with disability or chronic mental illness

These services strengthen the support system around the individual, helping improve outcomes and encourage long-term stability.

Conclusion

Navigating mental health care can be challenging, but Tricare mental health treatment centers ensure that service members, veterans, and their families receive the comprehensive support they need. With coverage options that include therapy, inpatient hospitalization, PHP, IOP, and substance use treatment, Tricare provides access to vital services that promote healing and long-term well-being.

Whether you're planning a cross-country road trip, a beach getaway, or an international adventure, ensuring your health coverage travels with you is crucial. GEA’s TRICARE Supplemental Insurance offers peace of mind, filling the gaps that TRICARE alone might not cover during your travels.

Understanding TRICARE’s Travel Coverage:

TRICARE provides robust healthcare coverage, but when you're away from home, certain limitations may apply:

Domestic Travel: With TRICARE Select, you can visit any TRICARE-authorized provider. However, you might need to pay upfront and file for reimbursement later.

International Travel: You can seek care from any overseas provider, but it's essential to keep all receipts for reimbursement purposes.

TRICARE Prime Travel Benefit (PTB): This benefit reimburses reasonable travel expenses when a beneficiary needs medical care over 100 miles away from their Primary Care Manager's office.

How GEA’s TRICARE Supplemental Insurance Enhances Your Coverage:

GEA's TRICARE Supplemental Insurance is designed to complement your existing TRICARE plan, especially during travel:

Reduced Out-of-Pocket Expenses: It helps cover co-pays, cost shares, and other expenses that TRICARE doesn't fully reimburse, ensuring you're not burdened with unexpected medical bills while on vacation.

Comprehensive Coverage: Whether you're dealing with an emergency room visit, urgent care, or prescription needs like Ozempic, the supplemental plan provides added financial protection.

Peace of Mind: Knowing that you have additional coverage allows you to enjoy your travels without constant worry about potential healthcare costs.

Tips for Traveling with TRICARE and GEA’s Supplemental Insurance:

Carry Essential Documents: Always have your TRICARE and supplemental insurance cards with you.

Know Your Network: Before traveling, research TRICARE-authorized providers in your destination area.

Keep Receipts: For any medical services or prescriptions obtained during your trip, retain all receipts to facilitate reimbursement.

Emergency Contacts: If traveling overseas, have the appropriate International SOS contact information handy.

Vacations are meant for relaxation and creating lasting memories, not for dealing with unexpected medical expenses. By enrolling in GEA’s TRICARE Supplemental Insurance, you ensure that you and your family have comprehensive coverage that travels with you, providing financial protection and peace of mind wherever your summer adventures take you.

Jackson Women’s Health Organization (Dobbs) declaring that there is no constitutional right to abortion, the Department of Defense (DoD), took critical action in October of 2022, announcing important changes to safeguard access to abortion and fertility care for service members and their families.

However, on January 29, 2025, Trump’s Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth rescinded key components of these policies for abortion access. These changes will have harmful consequences for service members who already face significant barriers to care. The FAQ below explains current restrictions on access to abortion in the military and DoD’s changes to policy since October 2022.

These materials have been prepared by the National Women’s Law Center (NWLC) for informational purposes only. The provision of this material does not create an attorney-client relationship between any attorney at NWLC and the reader, and does not constitute legal advice. For more information on this, please click here. Organizations and individuals are encouraged to contact a lawyer licensed in their jurisdiction for advice on their specific circumstances.

1. What abortion restrictions currently apply to military service members and their families?

Federal law prohibits DoD from providing abortion services at military treatment facilities (MTFs) except in cases of rape, incest, or to save the pregnant person’s life. Additionally, federal law prohibits TRICARE, the military health insurance program, from covering abortion except under the same limited circumstances. These restrictions are an extension of the harmful Hyde Amendment, which denies abortion coverage to individuals enrolled in the federal Medicaid program and has been expanded to other programs as well, including the military health care system.

These bans mean that service members and their dependents face a major barrier to abortion care no matter where they are stationed. If they need abortion care, but do not meet one of the extremely limited exceptions, service members or their dependents are forced to go outside of the military health care system and off base, navigate the maze of state bans and restrictions, and pay for the care out of pocket.

2. What abortion protections were rescinded by the Trump Administration?

On January 29, 2025, Secretary Hegseth rescinded the following Department policies that had expanded access to abortion care:1

Providing allowances, or payments, for travel and lodging for service members and dependents—and attendants and escorts if the individual is unable to travel alone—to travel to the closest medical facility.2

Directing the Armed Services to standardize their administrative absence policies, ensuring that service members can take non-chargeable time off from serving to be able to travel for care.3

Requiring commanders to use “objectivity, compassion, and discretion” when considering a service member’s health care information with regards to abortion.

3. What do these changes mean for access to fertility care in the military?

Currently, TRICARE does not cover certain assisted reproductive services, including intrauterine insemination.

However, according to a DoD memo, service members and dependents who need fertility care that they cannot access in the military should be able to obtain travel and transportation allowances, as well as take administrative absence, for the fertility care they need.4

4. Why are protections for abortion care so critical for those who serve and their loved ones?

Since the extremist Dobbs decision, states have moved to enact abortion bans and restrictions that have harmed countless people. But military families have always faced their own unique barriers to care, and these barriers have only grown in the aftermath of the Supreme Court’s decision to overturn Roe v. Wade.

The Military Health System (MHS) serves approximately 1.62 million women of reproductive age (15-45)5 and over two million MHS beneficiaries live in the 12 states where abortion is banned.6 An estimated several thousand transgender men who may require abortion care also serve on active duty in the Armed Forces and in the reserve components, in addition to non-binary members and those who identify with a different gender.7 The harms of abortion restrictions fall most heavily on people who already face barriers to accessing health care, including people with low incomes—such as junior service members—and Black, Indigenous, and people of color, immigrants, young people, people with disabilities, the LGBTQI+ community, and those living in rural and other medically underserved areas.

Service members cannot choose where they are stationed and require permission to seek care off-base, meaning they are at the mercy of their commander to take time off or leave their local duty station for care. And they often face stigma, discrimination, and harassment for seeking abortion care, or even for becoming pregnant.

Many service members face economic insecurity. Abortion bans across the country put these service members at further risk financially – or may ultimately force a service member or dependent to carry a pregnancy to term against their will. For instance, Texas and Georgia have some of the highest populations of military personnel in the country. These two states also experienced the largest declines in the number of abortions during the six-month period after the Dobbs decision, with many residents traveling out of state for an abortion.8

For a Private (E1) in the military who needs an abortion – and is making less than $28,000 a year9 – taking time off, renting a car, booking a flight, finding a hotel, or paying for the procedure itself may ultimately be too costly, meaning they will be denied access to abortion simply because they can’t afford it.

That’s why the Trump Administration’s decision to rescind key military travel and leave benefits for abortion is so devastating. Access to abortion should not depend on how much money someone makes, or where they live or are stationed.

5. Why are protections for abortion so critical for military health care providers?

In 2022, DoD made important changes recognizing that the decision to have an abortion should belong to the pregnant person, in consultation with their health care provider—without political interference.

Providers must have the ability to provide appropriate, necessary and compassionate care to their patients. But since the lawless overturning of Roe v. Wade, many providers cannot provide that care because of the wave of state laws restricting and banning abortion. As a result, patients have been turned away for care they need or forced to delay their care until their condition becomes critical;10 other patients risk losing access to the medication they need even if they are not seeking an abortion.11

In states that restrict abortion, DoD providers are subject to unique challenges and compounding restrictions when attempting to provide abortion care. DoD must support its providers who may be subject to legal or adverse actions. Protecting their providers in turn helps service members and their families build the futures they want.

6. I’m a military service member (or dependent of one). Where can I go to find resources for reproductive health care?

For help finding an abortion or learning more about resources and assistance in your state, visit INeedanA.com and AbortionFinder.org.

If you need help paying for certain legal expenses because you are an abortion patient or supporter – individuals and entities who sought abortion or helped someone obtain an abortion or information about abortion care – see the Abortion Access Legal Defense Fund for more information.

There are existing laws and policies that protect access to contraceptive care for service members and dependents. TRICARE beneficiaries are not subject to copays for contraception when obtaining a prescription at an MTF. And due to a new provision recently passed into law, non-active duty service members and dependents who were previously charged a copay for contraception obtained through mail order or at a retail pharmacy are no longer subject to a copay for their prescription.

In addition, people who can become pregnant no longer have to pay out-of-pocket for surgical sterilization services, often referred to as getting your tubes tied. Some contraceptives, like intrauterine devices (IUDs), shots, implants, or diaphragm measurement and fitting, no longer require cost-sharing or copayments; however, Opill, the first over-the-counter birth control medication, does currently require a prescription in order to obtain it without copay. If you have questions about out-of-pocket costs for your birth control, contact NWLC’s CoverHer hotline for help.

7. What should policymakers do to establish better protections for abortion care in the military?

It is DoD’s responsibility to protect the health and safety of military families. At minimum, the agency should reinstate policies that help service members and dependents access abortion care, especially if they need to travel off-base. This includes a transportation and travel allowance, as well as administrative absence. Congress should pass the Access to Reproductive Care for Servicemembers Act and the Protecting Service Members and Military Families’ Access to Health Care Act to codify these key travel policies.

However, service members and dependents still face bans on abortion in the military, with limited exceptions. Congress must pass the Military Access to Reproductive Care and Health for Military Servicemembers (MARCH) Act to eliminate the bans on abortion in TRICARE and at MTFs. For more information about the bill and why it’s so critical for service members and dependents, see NWLC’s fact sheet.

Today, DHA R&D-MRDC focuses its science and technology efforts on four strategic lines of effort: survivability and lethality, protection and readiness, medical modernization, and deterrence and posture.
Throughout the month of June, DHA R&D-MRDC is hosting a series of events that highlight the Army’s support to the nation while celebrating the Soldiers, families, retirees, and Department of Defense civilians who constitute the DHA R&D-MRDC family.
As the Army celebrates this important historical milestone, it also serves as an opportunity for the members of the DHA R&D-MRDC team to reflect on, and rededicate themselves to, its motto to Protect, Project, and Sustain.","FORT DETRICK, Md. – As the U.S. Army celebrates its 250th Birthday this month, Defense Health Agency Research & Development-Medical Research and Development Command commemorates its long and storied history of ensuring the nation’s Warfighters have the advanced treatments, trauma care solutions, and life-saving medical devices they need to ensure their survivability and lethality.

The Army’s motto – “This We’ll Defend” – is the theme for the 250th birthday celebrations. Fittingly, the concept of defending the nation’s Warfighters against threats to their health from traumatic injury, disease, and exposure to chemical, biological, radiological, and nuclear agents has been DHA R&D-MRDC’s dedicated mission since its founding nearly 70 years ago.

Today, as it has since its founding, DHA R&D-MRDC’s world-class team of researchers develop treatments for infectious diseases, field evidence-based care for combat-wounded personnel, pioneer research in chemical and biological defense, and explore ways to optimize the health and performance of Service Members – demonstrating their commitment to providing medical solutions for America's sons and daughters who serve around the globe.

DHA R&D-MRDC has a long and proud heritage. In 1958, the Army Medical Research Board became the U.S. Army Medical Research and Development Command and assumed the role of the Army’s central agency for all R&D efforts for improving preventive medicine measures and rapid treatment. In 1978, its headquarters moved from Washington D.C. to Fort Detrick, Maryland. Then, in 1994, USAMRDC became the U.S. Army Medical Research and Materiel Command, focusing on supporting the Army Medical Department's efforts to prevent illness and injury in deployed forces and ensuring the development of medical logistics systems that enhance medical readiness. In 2018, USAMRMC was once again redesignated as USAMRDC. In late 2024, USAMRDC completed its transition to the Defense Health Agency. Today, DHA R&D-MRDC focuses its science and technology efforts on four strategic lines of effort: survivability and lethality, protection and readiness, medical modernization, and deterrence and posture.

Throughout the month of June, DHA R&D-MRDC is hosting a series of events that highlight the Army’s support to the nation while celebrating the Soldiers, families, retirees, and Department of Defense civilians who constitute the DHA R&D-MRDC family. The events draw on Army tradition and heritage to promote the service’s role in defending the nation, and improving the command’s connection to the public in support of the recruiting mission. In addition to honoring the rich history of the Army’s contributions and achievements and promoting Army values, the celebrations aim to strengthen unit cohesion, teamwork, and esprit de corps.

MRDC Commanding General Maj. Gen. Paula C. Lodi kicked off the celebrations by hosting the Army Heritage Month Opening Ceremony at the Fort Detrick Auditorium June 3. Then, on June 13, the installation’s oldest and youngest Soldiers will join Garrison Commander Col. Chris Chung in the auditorium at 12:30 p.m. for a ceremonial cake cutting. Immediately following the cake cutting, attendees are invited to explore the Heritage Displays within the auditorium. Later that day, at 3 p.m., a Retreat Ceremony will be held at Blue and Gray Field followed by reenlistment and enlistment ceremonies and a special announcement by the Army Emergency Relief Campaign.

The social highlight of the month-long celebrations will be the Army’s 250th Birthday Gala Celebration June 14 at 6 p.m. at the Community Activities Center. The gala promises to be a night of camaraderie, celebration, and honor.

As the Army celebrates this important historical milestone, it also serves as an opportunity for the members of the DHA R&D-MRDC team to reflect on, and rededicate themselves to, its motto to Protect, Project, and Sustain.",https://api.army.mil/e2/c/images/2025/06/06/ff58e53c/max1200.jpg,N,1.0,2025-06-06 14:56:23.812201

He’s now running 100 miles a week, taking part in marathons, and remains on active duty with the U.S. Air Force.

Often called the hidden disease of recent battlefields, any TBI can bring on balance, vision, and hearing injuries, which can be very difficult to detect and diagnose.

There could be “multiple different medical disciplines that are involved” in diagnosing and treating a service member with suspected TBI, said Chrystyna Rakoczy, an optometrist who has worked with TBI-injured service members since 2009 at the Defense Health Agency’s Vision Center of Excellence and the Department of Veterans Affairs James A. Haley Veterans' Hospital in Tampa, Florida. These experts diagnose through painstaking and thorough detective work that is individual to each patient.

“The dysfunctions that are caused by TBI you have to proactively look for,” explained Rakoczy. “The symptoms are not obvious, and routine testing does not easily elicit these dysfunctions.”

Airman’s Medical Issues

After he experienced a 30-meter fall in a parachute-training accident, “the airman had a lot of difficulty walking a straight line, he couldn't run anymore, he couldn’t move his head without getting dizzy or having his vision blurred, and he was having difficulty sleeping,” Rakoczy recalled. Over time, he also developed numbing pain in his hands and shoulder problems.

The airman dealt with sensory problems for a decade while he sought help for his symptoms. “He had seen a number of ophthalmologists, neuro-ophthalmologists, neurologists, [and] optometrists,” Rakoczy said. “Eventually, they all sent him to psychiatry, and [he] was put on medications for mood and sleep disorders.”

‘Very Diagnosis-Driven Evaluation’

No single strategy works for TBI recovery, according to Rakoczy. “You have to work individually with every patient, and it has to be a multisensory approach; it has to be interdisciplinary teams working together.”

After an initial review at Tampa, the airman was diagnosed with a continuing mild TBI.

A physical therapy team found he had “benign positional paroxysmal vertigo, which is basically a dislocation of the otoliths within the inner ear canal,” Rakoczy said. Otoliths are gravity-sensitive organs that help orient your body’s awareness of space and movement. A common symptom of BPPV is a spinning sensation (vertigo) or dizziness, triggered when the head is moved into certain positions.

Test Examines Sensory Interactions

A posturography test, which assesses balance by measuring a person's ability to remain in a stable position under different conditions, showed while walking the injured airman “would veer off to one side or another, and that his entire body composition was pretty stiff … he had no ability to right himself,” Rakoczy said. The test helps to diagnose this type of balance disorder by placing the patient on a platform to evaluate their response to different movements on the platform—inner ear, vision, and touch.

The airman was sensing motion in his sight, but “his body would automatically feel the motion and he would not be able to keep his body in a straight position or in a stable position,” explained Rakoczy. Essentially, he would fall down if not attached to the equipment. He was treated with the Epley maneuver, a series of simple side-to-side movements of the head while sitting, lying down quickly, and turning over 90 degrees, which can reposition the otoliths.

Vision Team’s Diagnosis

Rakoczy’s vision team examined the airman after he completed the maneuver because he reported continuing visual issues.

His ease in being able to converge and diverge his eyes to focus on a single object “was very poor,” said Rakoczy. Our eyes are constantly diverging and converging, which, when accurate, “gives us a sense of balance,” she said. After considering all the data gathered through his treatment, including recreational and dance therapy, the vision team prescribed prescription eyeglasses that can bend light in one direction.

At a follow-up session, the airman “was completely normal” with all his vision and balance testing. “His [eyes’] ability to converge and diverge and his efficiency to converge and diverge had normalized completely,” Rakoczy said. “His headaches went away. He was sleeping better.” He also no longer needed medication, Rakoczy added.

Latest TBI Numbers and Early Identification

TBIs range from mild (concussion) to severe and can happen on- or off-duty.

Stephanie Maxfield Panker, clinical affairs section chief of the DHA’s Traumatic Brain Injury Center of Excellence Research and Engineering Division, who holds doctorates in neuroscience and physical therapy, said there were 515,885 service members diagnosed with TBI between calendar years 2000–2024.

Further insights from a data subset of 135,853 service members diagnosed with first-time TBI between calendar years 2017-2023 illustrate the relationship between TBI diagnosis and vestibular, hearing, and vision issues:

26.1%, or 35,449 individuals, reported vestibular-related issues after their TBI diagnosis

21.8%, or 29,582 individuals, were diagnosed with hearing-related issues

18.9%, or 25,716 individuals, had visual issues

Mild TBIs may result from blows or jolts to the head during motor vehicle accidents, sports, and military training, among other causes. TBIs may resolve quickly, while others linger, depending on the individual, the source of the TBI, the person’s duties in their branch of the military, and the exact location of the injury in their brain.

While the airman’s case was worked up nearly 10 years after his initial TBI diagnosis, service members should report any suspected brain injury as soon as possible to avoid long-term issues. “Early identification, evaluation, and appropriate management are keys to the best chance for a service member who has sustained a concussion to return to activity and duty as quickly as possible,” Panker said.

A TBICoE comorbidities dashboard for 2017–2019 is published on the CarePoint Information Portal, available via CAC. An updated dashboard with data from 2017 through 2023 is under development.

Sarepta is the first company to publicly disclose that it's received the designation. The FDA issued a draft guidance last year describing the program and, in the document, said it envisioned that such a designation program could accelerate the development and regulatory review of new medicines by defining ""platform"" components of approved drugs that may be reused within other products.

The FDA has yet to publish a final version of the guidance online. The FDA did not respond to a request for comment on the program and how many technologies it has granted the designation to.

While it's unclear what the final platform technology designation program looks like, the granting of a platform designation to Sarepta's rAAVrh74 indicates it's not limited to components of approved products, as had originally been outlined in the draft guidance. Sarepta previously said it plans to seek accelerated approval for SRP-9003 with the FDA this year.

Sarepta CSO and Head of R&D Louise Rodino-Klapac in a statement described rAAVrh74 as ""one of the first programs to receive platform technology designation."" Sarepta did not respond to a request for comment on the process to receive the designation or for which other therapeutic programs it plans to use rAAVrh74.

Rodino-Klapac in the statement said the designation represents ""important recognition by FDA of the reproducibility and adaptability of this technology across multiple therapeutic programs.""

The biotech industry in recent years had called on the FDA to establish a platform approach to drug development, through which sponsors could resubmit manufacturing and nonclinical safety data generated on designated components of a sponsor's therapeutics for other products that incorporate the same parts. That could prove particularly useful to streamline development for gene and gene-editing therapies, enabling sponsors to more easily leverage the same vectors or gene editors across multiple products while reducing the need for repeated testing of the same technologies.

To be eligible for platform technology designation, Sarepta in its announcement said a technology must be well understood, reproducible, and able to support development of multiple therapeutics. With the designation, the company will be able to leverage previous data on the technology to support investigational new drug applications and regulatory approval for other products.",https://crain-platform-precisiononcologynews-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/app-icons/favicon.ico,N,0.0,2025-06-06 12:56:24.759147

Many speakers described the challenges of developing treatments for rare diseases or pediatric populations.
June said he's concerned about the future of gene and cell therapies in the US, since many researchers are choosing to launch clinical trials in other countries that have more regulatory flexibility.
So, I think that's the approach that we need to take with cell and gene therapy.""","NEW YORK – Top health officials from the Trump administration, including US Department of Health & Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. and US Food and Drug Administration Commissioner Marty Makary, reassured drugmakers and other researchers Thursday that the agency will continue to prioritize development of gene and cell therapies.

In recent years, the FDA has been bullish on gene therapies as promising treatments for extremely rare diseases. Peter Marks, former director of the FDA's Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research (CBER), had repeatedly emphasized the agency's willingness to provide regulatory flexibility to companies developing gene therapies for rare diseases. The biotech industry has been wondering whether that would continue after Marks abruptly stepped down from his director role, which he had held since 2016, in March, citing concerns over department leadership under the Trump administration undermining the public's confidence in vaccines.

Makary, during a roundtable on Thursday convened by the FDA to discuss approaches for supporting gene and cell therapy R&D, said the US regulator would not only continue but build on existing efforts to facilitate access to promising, cutting-edge gene and cell therapy candidates, particularly for rare diseases. ""Let me be very clear: We are going to continue the successes of the FDA in facilitating the regulatory process for these conditions and for these products,"" Makary said. ""We are also going to try and improve by creating more efficiencies.""

The FDA, under Makary's purview, will ""challenge deeply held assumptions"" in how it reviews products, finding ways to accelerate getting them to market and focusing on candidates that target root causes, rather than symptoms, of disease. He voiced support for existing programs such as the accelerated approval pathway, priority review, and expanded access.

Makary, previously a surgeon at Johns Hopkins Medicine, said the FDA's overarching theme for how it intends to pursue regulation is ""gold-standard science and common sense."" He expressed interest in working closely with drugmakers to reduce barriers and inefficiencies. ""This FDA is an FDA interested in listening, learning, and evolving, not just our thinking in regulation but also our processes,"" Makary said.

Industry observers have been worried about the Trump administration's efforts to shrink the federal government, which have included layoffs at the FDA, the US National Institutes of Health, and other health agencies. The administration has cut research funding, which could have potential downstream effects on the development of advanced treatments.

Kennedy, who has harshly criticized Big Pharma and accused it of having undue influence over the FDA, also voiced support for developers of gene therapies at Thursday's roundtable, even as he continued to accuse the pharmaceutical industry of contributing to a wasteful healthcare system in the US.

He said the FDA's primary goal is curing diseases. ""You are so important to that, because that's what you do,"" Kennedy told a group of about two dozen gene and cell therapy experts, including academics, drugmakers, and patient advocates convened for the roundtable.

He contrasted one-time gene therapies to other medications for chronic conditions that patients have to take for their entire lives, which he sees as emblematic of the problems with the US healthcare system. Kennedy said a focus on curing disease stands at odds with the current system, in which physicians, hospitals, drugmakers, and insurers make money by keeping the American public sick. ""We need to unravel all these perverse incentives,"" he said. ""Our whole healthcare system is a bundle of perverse incentives, where people make money by doing bad things.""

Kennedy said he wants the FDA to take steps to ""unleash"" the power of gene therapy, and as such, the agency is looking to remove barriers to market. ""We want to make sure that we keep this country competitive with all other nations,"" Kennedy said. ""We're going to make this country the hub of biotechnology innovation.""

Mehmet Oz, the television personality known as Dr. Oz who President Donald Trump appointed as administrator of the US Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, likewise described gene therapies that address the root causes of diseases as ""what MAHA would have hoped in its wildest dreams."" MAHA, short for Make America Healthy Again, is the Trump administration's health agenda, which has focused on childhood chronic disease as a crisis, driven by factors including environmental toxins and overmedicalization.

During the roundtable, gene and cell therapy experts shared their own perspectives on what the FDA can do to support R&D and how to shepherd these treatments to patients, from continuing to support the accelerated approval pathway and the platform technology designation program to urging flexibility in clinical trial design and reauthorizing the rare pediatric disease priority review voucher program, which expired in December. Many speakers described the challenges of developing treatments for rare diseases or pediatric populations.

Carl June, director of the Center for Cellular Immunotherapies at the University of Pennsylvania's Perelman School of Medicine and a CAR T-cell therapy pioneer, proposed that the FDA may not need to regulate early-stage clinical trials of autologous gene-modified cell therapies. Instead, such early trials could be supervised by local institutional review boards until the investigational therapy advances to larger, multisite studies. He drew a comparison to China, where investigator-initiated trials are common for first-in-human studies.

June said he's concerned about the future of gene and cell therapies in the US, since many researchers are choosing to launch clinical trials in other countries that have more regulatory flexibility. ""Despite our early leadership, much of the innovation in this field is now happening offshore,"" he said. ""If we do not modernize our regulatory approach, we risk losing our leadership and undermining the long-term viability of our biopharma industry.""

While it's necessary to accelerate the development of gene and cell therapies, there are also bad actors in the field selling unproven stem cell treatments that the FDA should be wary of, noted Sean Morrison, founding director of the Children's Medical Center Research Institute at the University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center and a Howard Hughes Medical Institute investigator. ""Americans really need the FDA to protect them,"" Morrison said. ""'Buyer beware' is not an effective strategy when it comes to experimental medical therapies.""

Makary said it's possible to learn from individual cases, even if there isn't data from a comprehensive randomized, controlled trial. He cited the FDA's recent decision to ban petroleum-based synthetic food dyes, saying that the agency heard from families of children with behavioral issues that resolved after choosing to eliminate these from their diet. While there is research suggesting there may be an association between artificial food dyes and hyperactivity and neurobehavioral issues in children, there isn't agreement among scientists that artificial food dyes definitively cause these problems.

But Makary has been swayed by the evidence available so far and what he's heard from families. ""When you have a story like that, when you have an adverse event that's ignited seconds after the administration of something new in a young, healthy individual, that's causal until proven otherwise,"" Makary said. ""We can learn from individuals. So, I think that's the approach that we need to take with cell and gene therapy.""

Vinayak Prasad, director of CBER, also assured that the FDA will offer regulatory flexibility to developers of rare disease therapeutics and consider innovative study designs other than gold-standard randomized, controlled trials, such as studies in which patients might serve as their own control. ""We are fully committed to being flexible,"" he said. ""Diseases that are rare, dire, or [have] unique constellations or patterns cannot have the same paradigm as high blood pressure and high cholesterol.""

Prasad, prior to his role at the FDA, had voiced concerns over what he sees as overzealous adoption of precision oncology, a treatment approach that commonly involves drugs that target tumor biomarkers that can be exceedingly rare. He has argued that in many cases, researchers and drugmakers aren't conducting randomized, controlled trials even though they might be possible, because they've already bet that genomic profiling and biomarker-based treatments will help most patients live longer and better and they don't want to potentially face data that goes against that thinking. However, at the meeting Thursday, Prasad said the FDA supported the use of surrogate endpoints that could help gene and cell therapies reach the market more quickly, as long as they're paired with appropriate post-marketing research.

""We will rapidly make available therapies at the first sign or promise of biomedical success or action, but we're also going to follow up on overall survival and quality of life on the backend to ensure we're accomplishing what we think we're accomplishing,"" Prasad said.

He added that one of the FDA's core priorities under the Trump administration is transparency, such as through a podcast, dubbed FDA Direct, in which the agency's leadership will discuss updates and their rationale for major regulatory decisions. ""We want to make — through our peer-reviewed publications, through our video tapes, through our podcasts — more transparent the thinking going on inside the FDA,"" Prasad said.",https://crain-platform-precisiononcologynews-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/styles/1200x630/s3/FDA%20-%20iStock.jpg,N,0.0,2025-06-06 12:56:30.404533

TRICARE insurance covers specialized military alcohol rehabilitation services at facilities throughout California for active duty personnel and veterans.

Approximately 34 percent of service members report engaging in binge-drinking behaviors.

Military members with combat experience face unique challenges including PTSD, which often co-occurs with substance abuse and requires specialized dual diagnosis treatment.

Effective military-focused rehab programs should address underlying trauma while respecting the unique culture and experiences of service members.

Ona Treatment Center provides TRICARE-approved rehabilitation services specifically designed for military personnel and veterans.

TRICARE Can Cover Military-Specialized Rehab Programs in California

Military service members and veterans face unique challenges that can lead to substance use issues. The good news is that help is available through specialized treatment programs, many of which may be covered by TRICARE insurance. Ideally, these programs understand the distinct needs of those who have served our country and provide targeted support for recovery.

In California, several facilities are specifically equipped to treat military personnel and veterans struggling with alcohol addiction. These TRICARE-approved centers have developed specialized protocols intended to address the unique stressors, traumas, and experiences common to military life. Ona Treatment Center offers comprehensive rehabilitation services designed specifically for military personnel, with programs that honor your service while addressing addiction challenges.

The Military Substance Abuse Crisis by the Numbers

The statistics paint a clear picture of the substance abuse challenges facing our military community. This isn’t just a small problem affecting a few individuals – it’s a significant health crisis requiring dedicated attention and specialized care.

Many Veterans Struggle with Substance Use Disorders

According to the Department of Veteran Affairs, about 11 percent of veterans who visit a VA medical center do so for substance use disorders (SUDs). This rate is concerning and demonstrates the need for targeted treatment options. Military personnel face unique stressors that can contribute to substance misuse, including deployment stress, combat exposure, and the challenges of transitioning back to civilian life.

Alcohol Misuse: The Most Common Substance Problem

Among veterans seeking addiction treatment, about 80% struggle with alcohol misuse specifically, making it the most commonly abused substance in the military community according to VA statistics. This high percentage shows the importance of specialized alcohol rehabilitation programs that understand the unique needs of veterans and active duty personnel.

Combat Exposure and Deployment Stress as Risk Factors

Military personnel who have experienced combat situations face an increased risk of developing both substance use disorders and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). The stress of deployment, exposure to traumatic events, and the hypervigilance required in combat zones can take a significant toll on mental health. For many service members, alcohol or drugs become a way to self-medicate these symptoms, creating a dangerous cycle of addiction and mental health challenges.

Why Military Members Need Specialized Addiction Treatment

Standard addiction treatment programs often don’t fully address the unique needs of military personnel and veterans. Military service creates distinctive experiences, challenges, and traumas that require specialized approaches for effective recovery.

Addressing Combat Trauma and Substance Use Together

Many military personnel have experienced traumatic events during deployment or combat operations. These experiences can lead to lasting psychological effects that complicate addiction treatment. Specialized military rehab programs understand how combat trauma influences substance use and incorporate trauma-informed care into their treatment protocols.

Traditional rehab programs may not be equipped to address the specific types of trauma experienced during military service. Combat experiences, witnessing death or injury, or experiencing the constant threat of danger create unique psychological impacts. Military-focused programs employ therapists who understand these experiences and can provide appropriate interventions.

PTSD and Addiction: The Dual Diagnosis Challenge

Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and substance use disorders frequently occur together in military populations. This dual diagnosis presents complex treatment challenges that require integrated approaches. When PTSD symptoms like flashbacks, nightmares, or hypervigilance become overwhelming, many service members turn to alcohol or drugs to temporarily relieve their distress.

Effective treatment must address both conditions simultaneously. Military-focused rehab programs employ clinicians experienced in treating co-occurring PTSD and addiction. These specialists use evidence-based therapies specifically developed for trauma and substance use disorders, including:

Trauma-focused cognitive behavioral therapy

Prolonged exposure therapy

Eye movement desensitization and reprocessing (EMDR)

Medication-assisted treatment when appropriate

TRICARE Coverage for Addiction Treatment

TRICARE provides comprehensive health coverage for active duty service members, veterans, and their families, including substance abuse treatment services. Understanding your TRICARE benefits can help you access the care you need without unnecessary financial stress.

Eligibility Requirements for Active Duty and Veterans

TRICARE coverage for addiction treatment varies depending on your military status and specific TRICARE plan. Although the specifics will depend on the plan, generally, TRICARE covers medically necessary substance abuse treatment for eligible beneficiaries, including:

Active duty service members

Retired service members

National Guard/Reserve members

Family members of service members

Survivors

Medal of Honor recipients

Former spouses (in some cases)

Active duty service members typically need a referral from their primary care manager for substance abuse treatment, while other beneficiaries may self-refer to network providers. All five branches of the military offer substance abuse prevention and treatment programs that can provide initial assessment and referrals to appropriate care levels.

Coverage Levels for Different Treatment Services

TRICARE provides coverage for a comprehensive range of substance abuse treatment services in California. However, coverage levels and out-of-pocket costs vary depending on your specific TRICARE plan and the type of treatment needed. Generally, TRICARE covers:

Emergency inpatient detoxification

Medically supervised withdrawal management

Inpatient/residential rehabilitation programs

Intensive outpatient programs (IOPs)

Standard outpatient counseling services

Medication-assisted treatment for alcohol and opioid use disorders

Family therapy related to substance use treatment

Aftercare and relapse prevention services

Types of Military Rehab Programs Available in California

California offers a wide range of treatment options for military personnel and veterans struggling with alcohol addiction. These programs vary in intensity, structure, and approach, allowing individuals to find the right fit for their specific needs.

Medical Detoxification Services

For many individuals with alcohol dependence, the first step in recovery is medical detoxification. This process involves clearing alcohol from the body while managing withdrawal symptoms under medical supervision. Alcohol withdrawal can be dangerous and potentially life-threatening, making professional detox essential.

TRICARE-approved detox programs in California provide:

24/7 medical monitoring

Medication to manage withdrawal symptoms

Assessment for co-occurring mental health conditions

Development of a continuing care plan

Medical detox typically lasts 3 to 7 days, depending on the severity of dependence and individual factors. After completing detox, patients transition to the next appropriate level of care.

Residential/Inpatient Treatment Options

Residential rehab provides intensive, structured treatment in a live-in setting. For military personnel with severe alcohol use disorders or co-occurring PTSD, this level of care offers the comprehensive support needed for recovery. California hosts several TRICARE-approved residential facilities specializing in military treatment.

These programs typically include:

Individual therapy with trauma-informed counselors

Group therapy with fellow veterans or service members

Educational sessions about addiction and recovery

Holistic approaches like mindfulness and stress management

Family therapy when appropriate

Medication management for co-occurring conditions

Residential programs usually last 28-90 days, though longer stays may be approved when medically necessary. The structured environment and removal from triggers make this an effective option for many military personnel.

Outpatient Programs (Standard, IOP, and PHP)

For those who don’t require 24-hour care or have completed residential treatment, various outpatient options exist:

Standard Outpatient Treatment: Typically involves 1 to 3 hours of treatment per week, consisting of individual or group therapy. This level allows individuals to maintain work, school, and family responsibilities while receiving care.

Intensive Outpatient Programs (IOP): Provide 9 to 12 hours of treatment weekly, usually spread across 3 to 4 days. IOPs offer comprehensive care while allowing participants to live at home and maintain some regular activities.

Partial Hospitalization Programs (PHP): The most intensive outpatient option, providing 20-plus hours of treatment weekly across 5 to 7 days. PHPs offer a similar level of care to residential treatment but allow patients to return home each evening.

Many California facilities offer military-specific outpatient groups where veterans and service members can connect with peers who understand their experiences.

VA-Affiliated vs. Private Treatment Facilities

Military personnel and veterans in California can access treatment through either VA-affiliated programs or private facilities that accept TRICARE.

VA-Affiliated Treatment: The VA healthcare system offers substance use treatment at medical centers and outpatient clinics throughout California. These services include screening, detoxification, rehabilitation, and continuing care. VA programs are specifically designed for veterans and are typically covered for eligible individuals.

Private TRICARE-Approved Facilities: Many private treatment centers in California accept TRICARE insurance and offer specialized military programs. These facilities may provide more treatment options, additional amenities, or shorter wait times than VA facilities. Private centers like Ona Treatment Center have developed comprehensive programs specifically tailored to military needs while accepting TRICARE benefits.

Steps to Access TRICARE-Covered Rehab Services

Getting into treatment may seem challenging, but breaking it down into concrete steps makes it manageable. Here’s how to access TRICARE-covered rehab services in California:

1. Verify Your TRICARE Benefits

Before seeking treatment, it’s important to understand your specific TRICARE coverage. You can verify your benefits by:

Calling the TRICARE regional contractor for the West Region

Logging into your TRICARE online account

Speaking with a benefits counselor at your military treatment facility

When verifying benefits, ask about coverage for different levels of care, in-network requirements, and any potential out-of-pocket costs.

2. Obtain Necessary Referrals

Depending on your TRICARE plan and status, you may need referrals for certain types of treatment:

Active duty service members typically need a referral from their primary care manager

TRICARE Prime beneficiaries usually need referrals for specialty care

TRICARE Select members may self-refer to most treatment options

If you’re unsure whether you need a referral, contact your TRICARE regional contractor for guidance.

3. Complete Pre-Authorization Requirements

Many types of rehab services require pre-authorization from TRICARE. This process involves verifying that the treatment is medically necessary. To obtain pre-authorization:

Your provider submits clinical information about your condition

TRICARE reviews the information to determine medical necessity

Approval must be received before beginning treatment (except in emergencies)

The pre-authorization process typically takes 2-5 business days, though urgent requests may be processed faster.

4. Choose an In-Network Provider

To minimize out-of-pocket costs, select a TRICARE-authorized in-network provider. California offers numerous in-network options specializing in military treatment. You can find in-network providers by:

Using the TRICARE provider directory online

Calling the TRICARE regional contractor

Asking for recommendations from your primary care provider

When selecting a provider, consider both their TRICARE network status and their experience with military-specific issues.

5. Understand Your Cost-Sharing Responsibilities

Even with TRICARE coverage, you may have some out-of-pocket expenses. These can include:

Annual deductibles (varying by plan type)

Copayments for office visits

Cost-shares for inpatient services

Potential charges for non-covered services

Active duty service members typically have minimal or no out-of-pocket costs, while retirees and family members have variable cost-sharing requirements based on their specific TRICARE plan.

Recovery Is Possible: Take the First Step Today

Taking that first step toward recovery may feel challenging, but effective help is available. Military service presents unique challenges, but specialized treatment programs understand these challenges and know how to address them effectively.

By accessing TRICARE-covered rehab services in California, you’re giving yourself the opportunity to reclaim your life from alcohol addiction. The specialized care available through military-focused programs acknowledges your service while providing the tools needed for lasting recovery. Ona Treatment Center stands ready to support military personnel and veterans with TRICARE-approved alcohol rehabilitation services designed specifically for those who have served our country.

Led by Cmdr. Theron Hamilton, assistant officer in charge of the Navy Entomology Center of Excellence (NECE), this three-year effort is turning the common house fly into a global scout for disease-causing bacteria and viruses. The project is funded by the Defense Health Agency through the Global Emerging Infections Surveillance (GEIS) program which directly supports one of Navy Medicine’s Lines of Effort, increase deployability or warfighter readiness.

With support from Naval Medical Forces Atlantic Improvement Sciences (IS), Hamilton has applied modern project management tools to lead the effort. He is the first in Navy Medicine to pursue a new project management certification program, and once completed, will earn both Navy Medicine’s Project Management Certification and the Navy’s Additional Qualification Designator (AQD) in project management.

Working with NECE’s Dr. Jason Blanton, Battelle Memorial Institute scientists, NECE lab staff, and researchers at the U.S. Department of Agriculture, the team uses cutting-edge next-generation DNA sequencing technology to analyze the microbes house flies collect. These insects naturally land on waste and decaying material, making them ideal collectors of bacteria, viruses, and even drug-resistant “superbugs” that can pose major challenges to treating battlefield injuries.

Samples collected from flies near military bases—including those in the U.S. and locations like Djibouti, Sudan, Ethiopia, and Somalia—are processed using the advanced DNA sequencing and bioinformatics. This allows researchers to detect both known pathogens and emerging microbial threats, including bacteria resistant to multiple antibiotics.

This “early warning” approach is a game changer. Rather than reacting to outbreaks after they occur, the Navy can now identify potential risks early, providing military leaders with valuable data to help prevent illness before it spreads.

A critical aspect of this research is its ability to detect antimicrobial-resistant (AMR) and multidrug-resistant (MDR) bacterial species. These “superbugs” pose a significant and growing threat to U.S. force health protection, as conventional antibiotics are often ineffective against them. Battlefield injuries, for instance, are notoriously susceptible to MDR organisms, being at least five and a half times more likely to be infected than non-battle injuries. Tracking the existence and spread of these resistant microbes is paramount to safeguarding military personnel.

Beyond identifying known threats, the project also has the capacity to pinpoint microbes to specific geographic regions, potentially signaling new and unforeseen dangers that medical personnel might encounter.

The first phase of the project analyzed samples from around Fort Riley in Kansas, serving as a successful proof of concept. The second phase has expanded sample collection globally, with improvements in lab techniques and computer analysis based on earlier lessons learned.

Data collected is shared quickly with the Defense Health Agency and other Department of Defense partners. The team has also developed risk maps—easy-to-use visual tools that show where microbial threats may be higher—delivered ahead of schedule to help commanders make informed decisions.

By combining science, strategic planning, and a commitment to constant improvement, this project exemplifies the Navy’s “Get Real, Get Better” mindset—identifying problems, learning fast, and taking action to strengthen warfighter readiness around the world.",https://cdn.dvidshub.net/images/dvids_logo.svg,N,0.0,2025-06-06 12:56:33.826168

This is a catch-all term so you might hear it used by providers to describe services, but it is also often used to describe state-run programs. Early Intervention is available in every US state and territory. These publicly funded programs provide services for free or at reduced cost for any child who is eligible.

Everyone is eligible to apply for early intervention services. The state-run program will perform an evaluation of your child’s skills and abilities to see what services they qualify for.

If you, your child’s doctor, or other care provider is concerned about your child’s development, ask to be connected with the local brand of your state’s early intervention program to find out if your child can get services to help. If your doctor is not able to connect you, you can reach out yourself. A doctor’s referral is not necessary.

Unfortunately, this process might take a while. You should expect to have to wait for the evaluation (possibly several weeks). Many early intervention programs have a waitlist because they don’t have enough staff to meet demand for services. However, if your child does qualify, you’ll be assigned a case manager who should help you navigate the program. This case manager will help you get started with services as soon as possible.

Joan Alker, executive director, Georgetown University Center for Children and Families, said Medicaid is vital for service members whose kids need more complex medical care.
He added Medicaid cuts would also affect veterans and their families, since around 50% of young people in the nation currently use Medicaid for their health coverage.","As Republican lawmakers consider cutting billions of dollars in Medicaid services, a new report reveals the proposed reductions could affect thousands of military families in Pennsylvania. The Georgetown University Center for Children and Families says more than 850,000 people with TRICARE, the military’s health insurance, also rely on Medicaid.

Retired Army Brigadier General George Schwartz points out that one in 10 children of active-duty military depends on Medicaid for additional health coverage, and warns that without proper coverage for their families, service members may leave the military for careers with better benefits, which would affect recruitment.

“And as those young people reach the age where they’re eligible for military service, or the military is competing with private industry and all sorts of organizations for these young people. And so that, from a mission readiness standpoint, this is a matter of national security,” he explained.

Pennsylvania is home to more than 2,500 active-duty military members, and more than 111,000 veterans and military contractors. The budget reconciliation bill is in the Senate with a vote expected by the end of June. Republicans are pushing for $2 trillion in federal spending cuts.

Medicaid also serves 40% of children in the United States with a benefit that allows them to receive preventive and ameliorative care.

Joan Alker, executive director, Georgetown University Center for Children and Families, said Medicaid is vital for service members whose kids need more complex medical care.

“The TRICARE benefit package just isn’t enough, so Medicaid is making TRICARE work for those families by covering the high cost of services and some benefits that those children otherwise would not have access to,” she explained.

Schwartz served in both the Army Reserve and the Army National Guard and said most of his military experience has been as a citizen soldier. He added Medicaid cuts would also affect veterans and their families, since around 50% of young people in the nation currently use Medicaid for their health coverage.

“I am very concerned that this could affect those citizen soldiers too, because it was only since 911 that TRICARE was extended to reservists and National Guardsmen because it was viewed as a matter of improving the readiness of the reserve components,” he continued.

For one patient, the clinic made nine prosthetic fingers. This was a complex and costly procedure and months after providing the prosthetic fingers, the clinic had trouble getting paid by the insurance company.

Humana Military, a contractor for TRICARE East, approved the procedure before the clinic moved forward with the treatment. Carolyn Hicks, the patient care coordinator at The Anaplastology Clinic showed ABC11 the official documentation confirming all nine fingers were authorized. Still, once the work was done and the prostheses were delivered, payment didn't follow.

""They've denied it many times,"" Hicks told ABC11 Troubleshooter Diane Wilson. ""We've called, I've got reference numbers and everything stating that, at one point, they said they never received the invoice, they never received the office notes, and we have submitted them many times.""

They did receive a check for about $1,600, but that only covered a small portion of what they were owed. ""It's almost $60,000,"" said Hicks. ""We're a very small practice here, so this has really impacted our money flow that comes into the building.""

After seeing a similar story ABC11 had covered, Office Manager Taffy Jones called the Troubleshooter team. ""I thought we need help too,"" Jones said. ""So I'm like, I'm calling Diane.""

He’s now running 100 miles a week, taking part in marathons, and remains on active duty with the U.S. Air Force.

Often called the hidden disease of recent battlefields, any TBI can bring on balance, vision, and hearing injuries, which can be very difficult to detect and diagnose.

There could be “multiple different medical disciplines that are involved” in diagnosing and treating a service member with suspected TBI, said Chrystyna Rakoczy, an optometrist who has worked with TBI-injured service members since 2009 at the Defense Health Agency’s Vision Center of Excellence and the Department of Veterans Affairs James A. Haley Veterans' Hospital in Tampa, Florida. These experts diagnose through painstaking and thorough detective work that is individual to each patient.

“The dysfunctions that are caused by TBI you have to proactively look for,” explained Rakoczy. “The symptoms are not obvious, and routine testing does not easily elicit these dysfunctions.”

Airman’s Medical Issues

After he experienced a 30-meter fall in a parachute-training accident, “the airman had a lot of difficulty walking a straight line, he couldn't run anymore, he couldn’t move his head without getting dizzy or having his vision blurred, and he was having difficulty sleeping,” Rakoczy recalled. Over time, he also developed numbing pain in his hands and shoulder problems.

The airman dealt with sensory problems for a decade while he sought help for his symptoms.

“He had seen a number of ophthalmologists, neuro-ophthalmologists, neurologists, [and] optometrists,” Rakoczy said. “Eventually, they all sent him to psychiatry, and [he] was put on medications for mood and sleep disorders.”

‘Very Diagnosis-Driven Evaluation’

No single strategy works for TBI recovery, according to Rakoczy. “You have to work individually with every patient, and it has to be a multisensory approach; it has to be interdisciplinary teams working together.”

After an initial review at Tampa, the airman was diagnosed with a continuing mild TBI.

A physical therapy team found he had “benign positional paroxysmal vertigo, which is basically a dislocation of the otoliths within the inner ear canal,” Rakoczy said. Otoliths are gravity-sensitive organs that help orient your body’s awareness of space and movement.

A common symptom of BPPV is a spinning sensation (vertigo) or dizziness, triggered when the head is moved into certain positions.

Test Examines Sensory Interactions

A posturography test, which assesses balance by measuring a person's ability to remain in a stable position under different conditions, showed while walking the injured airman “would veer off to one side or another, and that his entire body composition was pretty stiff … he had no ability to right himself,” Rakoczy said.

The test helps to diagnose this type of balance disorder by placing the patient on a platform to evaluate their response to different movements on the platform—inner ear, vision, and touch.

The airman was sensing motion in his sight, but “his body would automatically feel the motion and he would not be able to keep his body in a straight position or in a stable position,” explained Rakoczy. Essentially, he would fall down if not attached to the equipment.

He was treated with the Epley maneuver, a series of simple side-to-side movements of the head while sitting, lying down quickly, and turning over 90 degrees, which can reposition the otoliths.

Vision Team’s Diagnosis

Rakoczy’s vision team examined the airman after he completed the maneuver because he reported continuing visual issues.

His ease in being able to converge and diverge his eyes to focus on a single object “was very poor,” said Rakoczy. Our eyes are constantly diverging and converging, which, when accurate, “gives us a sense of balance,” she said.

After considering all the data gathered through his treatment, including recreational and dance therapy, the vision team prescribed prescription eyeglasses that can bend light in one direction.

At a follow-up session, the airman “was completely normal” with all his vision and balance testing.

“His [eyes’] ability to converge and diverge and his efficiency to converge and diverge had normalized completely,” Rakoczy said. “His headaches went away. He was sleeping better.” He also no longer needed medication, Rakoczy added.

Latest TBI Numbers and Early Identification

TBIs range from mild (concussion) to severe and can happen on- or off-duty.

Stephanie Maxfield Panker, clinical affairs section chief of the DHA’s Traumatic Brain Injury Center of Excellence Research and Engineering Division, who holds doctorates in neuroscience and physical therapy, said there were 515,885 service members diagnosed with TBI between calendar years 2000–2024.

Further insights from a data subset of 135,853 service members diagnosed with first-time TBI between calendar years 2017-2023 illustrate the relationship between TBI diagnosis and vestibular, hearing, and vision issues:

• 26.1%, or 35,449 individuals, reported vestibular-related issues after their TBI diagnosis

• 21.8%, or 29,582 individuals, were diagnosed with hearing-related issues

• 18.9%, or 25,716 individuals, had visual issues

Mild TBIs may result from blows or jolts to the head during motor vehicle accidents, sports, and military training, among other causes. TBIs may resolve quickly, while others linger, depending on the individual, the source of the TBI, the person’s duties in their branch of the military, and the exact location of the injury in their brain.

While the airman’s case was worked up nearly 10 years after his initial TBI diagnosis, service members should report any suspected brain injury as soon as possible to avoid long-term issues.

“Early identification, evaluation, and appropriate management are keys to the best chance for a service member who has sustained a concussion to return to activity and duty as quickly as possible,” Panker said.

A TBICoE comorbidities dashboard for 2017–2019 is published on the CarePoint Information Portal, available via CAC. An updated dashboard with data from 2017 through 2023 is under development.

“Most TRICARE providers act with honesty and integrity,” said Jennifer Dietz, director of Health Care Fraud Resolution for the Defense Health Agency Office of the Inspector General.
How to report fraud or abuse If you suspect fraud or abuse, report it right away.
Here’s how: Contact your TRICARE contractor: This may be your TRICARE regional or overseas contractor, TRICARE For Life, TRICARE Pharmacy Program, or TRICARE Dental Program.
How you can help prevent fraud and abuse The FBI offers some tips for preventing health care fraud and abuse.","Health care fraud and abuse harms everyone. Fraud and abuse can drive up costs and divert resources. TRICARE is committed to protecting the health information of service members, retirees, and their family members. You can help by knowing how to spot fraud or abuse — and by reporting it when you see it.

“Most TRICARE providers act with honesty and integrity,” said Jennifer Dietz, director of Health Care Fraud Resolution for the Defense Health Agency Office of the Inspector General. “But when fraud or abuse happens, it diverts resources that should be used to provide access to appropriate and quality medical care.”

Here’s what you should know to recognize, report, and help prevent fraud and abuse.

What is fraud?

Fraud happens when a person or organization knowingly deceives TRICARE to gain a benefit -- or payment -- they aren’t entitled to.

Examples of fraud include:

Billing for services that weren’t provided

Falsifying medical records or claims

Misrepresenting services to charge a higher rate

Using someone else’s information

Hiding other health coverage

What is abuse?

Abuse involves improper practices that may or may not be intentional but result in unnecessary costs to TRICARE.

Examples of abuse include:

Waiving copayments or cost-shares without proper documentation

Billing for services that aren’t necessary

Keeping poor or incomplete records

Repeated improper billing practices

Refusing medical record requests

How to spot suspected fraud or abuse

Pay attention if you see anything suspicious or unfamiliar on your bill. One example is if you receive a bill for a service you never received. You should also be cautious if a provider offers you a “free” service but asks for your TRICARE information in return—this could be a scam.

Keep an eye out for duplicate charges for the same procedure, which may signal improper billing. Also, be wary if you feel pressured into accepting treatments or services that weren’t requested. These are all potential signs of fraud or abuse.

Lastly, you should review your explanation of benefits regularly. This is the best way to spot fraud or abuse. Your EOB lists the care you received, what’s been billed, and what TRICARE paid. If something doesn’t match, contact your regional contractor.

How to report fraud or abuse

If you suspect fraud or abuse, report it right away. Here’s how:

Contact your TRICARE contractor:

This may be your TRICARE regional or overseas contractor, TRICARE For Life, TRICARE Pharmacy Program, or TRICARE Dental Program. Visit Report Fraud or Abuse for a complete list of contacts.

Contact the Defense Health Agency Office of the Inspector General:

File a report through the DHA OIG.

When making a report, include as much detail as you can, such as:

Names of providers or organizations involved

Dates of service or incidents

Description of the suspected fraud or abuse

You can choose to remain anonymous. All reports are confidential.

How you can help prevent fraud and abuse

The FBI offers some tips for preventing health care fraud and abuse. To ensure you don’t become a victim of fraud or abuse, you should:

Protect your personal information: Treat your personal information like your Social Security card. Only share it with trusted health care providers.

Be cautious about “free” services: Be wary of anyone offering you free medical equipment, prescriptions, or services in exchange for your TRICARE information.

Review your EOBs and bills carefully: Make sure you recognize all services and charges listed. If you spot an error, first call your provider. If they can’t resolve it, report it to your TRICARE contractor.

Stay informed about common scams: TRICARE will never contact you asking for your Social Security number, banking information, or personal health details over the phone or email.",https://media.defense.gov/2025/Jun/05/2003733094/1920/1080/0/250605-O-D0202-1001.PNG,N,0.0,2025-06-05 18:56:16.226989

Broadcast version by Danielle Smith for Keystone State News Connection reporting for the Pennsylvania Independent-Public News Service Collaboration

Josie Badger doesn't know where she would be without Medicaid.

""I use a ventilator, power wheelchair,"" said Badger, a disability rights advocate who lives in western Pennsylvania's Lawrence County. ""I have 24-hour care. I could not get out of bed every day without that care, let alone work, have a business, be a foster mom, own a home, any of that. So, without that coverage, Josie would not be here.""

Badger was born with a physical disability called congenital myasthenic syndrome, which leaves an individual with weakened muscles, and she spent months on end in the hospital as a child. While she was growing up, Badger's parents repeatedly considered getting a divorce solely so they could each have their own private insurance plan that Badger could use.

""Fortunately, that didn't happen,"" Badger said of her parents divorcing. ""Now, as an adult, I receive waiver through Medicaid home-based services, and it is my lifeline.""

Now, however, Badger is fighting to keep that lifeline.

In an effort to pay for President Donald Trump's tax cuts for the wealthiest Americans, House Republicans on May 22 passed legislation, which they named the ""One Big Beautiful Bill Act,"" that would carve about $700 billion from Medicaid, add approximately $3.3 trillion to the national debt over the next decade, and cause about 13.7 million people to lose health care coverage nationwide. The bill passed the House by a vote of 215-214, with all but five Republicans voting for it and no Democratic support. Every Republican House member from Pennsylvania supported the bill, which is now before the Senate. Trump is expected to sign the bill if it passes the Senate. If the Senate changes anything in the House bill, the two chambers must work out those differences and vote on the final legislation before sending it to the president.

In Pennsylvania, where close to one-quarter of the population is enrolled in Medicaid, the federal Medicaid cuts could strip health coverage from hundreds of thousands of residents, including people with disabilities, individuals in nursing homes, and children. About 750,000 people with disabilities use Medicaid in Pennsylvania.

""We're at a place where we need to become very public about what's going on, because I don't think enough people realize that these cuts are going to affect them,"" Badger said. ""They don't realize that Medicaid pays for services in schools. They don't realize that the Affordable Care Act that they're buying, those services could go away.""

'I become paralyzed with the fear'

For Badger, a loss of Medicaid or reduced benefits would be life-changing. Currently, she is able to afford six nurses and three home-care attendants who provide around-the-clock services through her Medicaid plan. It's this kind of care that keeps her out of a nursing home and living in her own house with her family, running her own consulting firm, which works to empower people with disabilities, and generally living a life she loves.

As Republicans push for the largest cuts to Medicaid in the program's 60-year history, Badger is trying to focus less on how her own personal life would be affected by the GOP's plan and more on galvanizing people to fight for the public health insurance program that covers about 80 million people nationally, or about 20% of the country's population.

""For me, I can't think a lot about it in terms of my own life because I become paralyzed with the fear, with the anxiety, and so I have to go and activate other folks to get involved,"" Badger said. ""The community is really what keeps me going and realizing why it's important that there's hope. And so a lot of my work time I've been donating towards trying to elevate people's voices for a lot of issues, not just Medicaid. I'm not even sure I can process it on a personal level.""

Should the House bill be signed into law, Badger said, she expects her home caregivers could lose their jobs, or leave them, because of a lack of funding. That, then, could leave older people and people with disabilities with no option but to go into a nursing home.

""Nursing homes, historically, have been last resort, even though they are one of the most expensive options, and so I think that there's going to be a come-to-Jesus moment when we start seeing millions of folks with disabilities and older adults needing care not being able to get it and ending up in nursing homes that are also underfunded,"" Badger said.

Losing home- and community-based services

Jennifer Garman, the president of Disability Rights Pennsylvania, is also deeply worried about cuts to home- and community-based services that are funded by Medicaid, including housing and employment support. Through those services, people with disabilities are able to live in their own homes as well as work.

""We already also have a waiting list for home- and community-based services for people with intellectual disabilities,"" Garman said. ""And so we would also be concerned that waiting lists will grow for services and that people will have to wait a longer time than they're already waiting.""

""It will just be a tremendous strain on the commonwealth and really deeply impact the community and people accessing the services that they need,"" Garman continued.

Cutting or decreasing those services would be disastrous, said Christie Cyktor, the youth leadership and training coordinator for western Pennsylvania at the PEAL Center. The PEAL Center works with youth with disabilities and their families to help them advocate for themselves in a variety of settings, such as school or the workplace.

Cyktor, who has a congenital disability that affects her joints and has used a power wheelchair since the age of 8, explained the youth she works with want to go to college, be in the workforce and live independently. In order for them to do that, they need to have a direct-care worker who helps them with various tasks, depending on their needs, such as dressing themselves, she explained.

Cutting those services would harm people who want to contribute to their families, communities and economy, Cyktor said.

""They want to contribute to the workforce and economy and give back that way, but they're like, How am I going to afford this if I can't fund a direct-care worker?"" Cyktor said.

Cyktor doesn't currently have a direct-care worker, but she did in college, and she said that support allowed her to graduate.

""There's no way that I would have been able to go live independently at college if I did not have this woman,"" Cyktor said. ""She was the sweetest woman and would come in the morning, help me get up, get dressed for the day, get me set up, and I could go do things independently during the day. And then she'd come back at night, and, same thing, sort of helped me get ready for the night and everything. And that enabled me to go get my degree.""

Support at school

Medicaid also funds school-based services, which is the only way that many school districts are able to afford means of support for students with disabilities, such as occupational therapy, nurses, mental health care, and specialized equipment such as wheelchairs.

Cuts to those services could have lifelong consequences for students, Cyktor said. In addition to working at the PEAL Center, Cyktor also provides virtual occupational therapy for students across Pennsylvania.

""So many school-based services are funded by Medicaid, and so it's already something I've sort of been thinking about for these families who I see all across Pennsylvania, in very rural areas, and really the cyber platform is maybe the only time they have access to occupational therapy, any other service,"" Cyktor said. ""So if that gets cut, these kids are going to be losing out on these vital services and doing this really important development at such a young age.""

Cyktor works with students in kindergarten through 12th grade on fine motor skills, such as handwriting and typing, as well as executive functioning skills like daily activity scheduling. Without those skills, it will be difficult to enter the workforce, she emphasized.

""If they're cut now, the future impacts are going to be huge for them,"" she said.

(Nasdaq: COCP) announces that its broad-spectrum protease inhibitor CDI-988 will be featured in an oral presentation at the 2025 Military Health System Research Symposium (MHSRS) being held August 4-7 in Kissimmee, Fla. Cocrystal is developing CDI-988 as a norovirus prophylaxis and treatment. Sam Lee, PhD, the Company’s President and co-CEO, will discuss Phase 1 results during the Broad-Spectrum Anti-Viral Countermeasures breakout session on August 4, 2025.

“I am pleased to be discussing CDI-988 at this prestigious conference that showcases innovative antiviral agents to treat militarily relevant pathogens,” said Dr. Lee. “Norovirus is a leading cause of acute gastroenteritis worldwide for which there are no approved antiviral agents or vaccines. Norovirus spreads rapidly through confined spaces such as in ships or other military settings, and can inflict severe vomiting and diarrhea, posing a potential threat to operational effectiveness and a significant economic burden.

“Cocrystal developed CDI-988 as a potential breakthrough for norovirus prophylaxis and treatment using our proprietary structure-based platform technology. Unlike conventional antivirals, it targets the virus' core replication machinery, halting infection at early stages regardless of viral strain or mutation,” he added. “We believe CDI-988 could transform how norovirus outbreaks are prevented and treated.”

Pan-Viral Inhibitor CDI-988

CDI-988 was designed and developed as a broad-spectrum inhibitor to a highly conserved region in the active site of 3CL viral proteases. Based on a novel mechanism of action and superior broad-spectrum antiviral activity, CDI-988 represents a compelling first-in-class oral treatment for both noroviruses and coronaviruses. Cocrystal has completed a single-center, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled Phase 1 study in healthy adults evaluating the safety, tolerability and pharmacokinetics of CDI-988, including a food effect cohort.

Structure-Based Platform Technology

Cocrystal’s proprietary structural biology, along with its expertise in enzymology and medicinal chemistry, enable its development of novel antiviral agents. The Company’s platform provides a three-dimensional structure of inhibitor complexes at near-atomic resolution, providing immediate insight to guide Structure Activity Relationships. This helps to identify novel binding sites and allows for a rapid turnaround of structural information through highly automated X-ray data processing and refinement. The goal of this technology is to facilitate the development of best-in-class antiviral therapies that have fast onset of action or shortened treatment time, are safe, well tolerated and easy to administer; and are effective against all viral subtypes that cause disease and have a high barrier to viral resistance.

Raney also highlighted the important advocacy role military caregivers play within the Military Health System, saying, “You hold us accountable. You push us to do what we should be doing, and for that, I can say a sincere, ‘Thank you.’ You are making health care and our processes better not just for you, but for everybody else. You live and are the Army Value that I consider the most significant – selfless service.”

U.S. Army Col. Elizabeth Cain, SRB-NCR commander, echoed these sentiments. She stressed how essential it is to recognize military caregivers for their partnership and the sacrifices they make to help service members move through their healing process, whether it’s returning to active duty or transitioning to veteran status.

Known as the “Tennessee National Guard Servicemember’s Medical Readiness Act,” the new law helps Guardsmen offset the cost of healthcare premiums under TRICARE Reserve Select and the TRICARE Dental Program.

Previously, traditional Guardsmen, those serving part-time under state or federal orders for training, were responsible for paying the full cost of their TRICARE coverage unless insured through a civilian employer. While deployed on federal active duty, they receive full medical coverage, but during regular training periods, they were responsible for purchasing their own insurance. For many, this meant covering TRICARE premiums themselves to maintain continuous coverage.

“This legislation improves access to healthcare for our Soldiers and Airmen,” said Maj. Gen. Warner Ross, Tennessee’s Adjutant General. “It will increase our overall medical readiness and ensures that our Guardsmen will have access to healthcare throughout their service, regardless of duty status.”

This program is expected to benefit nearly 2,000 servicemembers when it takes effect on July 1st. To qualify, Tennessee Guardsmen must be enrolled in TRICARE Reserve Select or the TRICARE Dental Program and must not receive comparable coverage from a civilian employer.

The Tennessee National Guard Association played a key role in advocating for the legislation and working with lawmakers to get it passed.

“Our Soldiers and Airmen make real sacrifices to serve their state and nation, and this program ensures they remain ready to answer the call when their fellow citizens need them the most,” said Lt. Col. Meredith Richardson, President of the National Guard Association of Tennessee.

This initiative reflects Tennessee’s ongoing efforts to support its National Guard members, ensuring they have access to healthcare resources while serving the state and nation.

Since the National Guard Association of Tennessee was establishment in 1924, it has been promoting and supporting our national defense and the welfare of Tennessee National Guard members,” said retired Col. Byron Deel, the NGATN Executive Director. “This legislation is a great step forward to improve both.”",https://www.clarksvilleonline.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Tennessee-Governor-Bill-Lee-Signs-Law-to-Reimburse-TRICARE-Premiums-for-Tennessee-Guardsmen-1.jpg,N,1.0,2025-06-04 22:56:43.131908

Stars and Stripes serves the U.S. military community by providing editorially independent news and information around the world.

Inconsistencies between states could have cost U.S. taxpayers and Tricare beneficiaries millions of dollars in excessive payments for some medical procedures and devices, a watchdog report has found.

The cost of certain medical procedures and devices varied greatly from state to state, according to a Pentagon inspector general audit published May 1. That probe found Tricare — the military's Defense Health Agency-run medical insurance provider that covers some 9.5 million troops, veterans and their family members — paid out thousands of dollars more for similar procedures and medical devices in some states versus others. The report found inconsistent DHA policies governing the amount of money that Tricare pays for medical care.

[READ THE REPORT]

In one instance, the IG found Tricare was paying some $11,500 for custom sleep apnea mouthguards in Illinois that were costing it about $3,000 in neighboring Iowa. The payment discrepancy came about because Tricare, which is split into two regions in the U.S. with Illinois in its east section and Iowa in its west, uses contractors to establish a basic pay rate, known as a prevailing rate, for standard procedures and devices based on the amounts that providers in those states had charged Tricare in the past. The state's prevailing rate is then set at the 80th percentile of all those charges.

The IG found there were no efforts to ensure payment rates were more consistent from one state to another. The auditors recommended Defense Health Agency officials reevaluate their methodology and ensure payment rates are not based on fraudulent or unreasonable rates charged in the past.

""Because the DHA did not determine that the state prevailing rates were reasonable, the [Defense Department] is at risk of wasteful spending and increasing DOD beneficiaries' risk of unreasonable cost-shares for health care services and items that are paid with state prevailing rates,"" the report states.

The probe also found Tricare might have been overpaying for some more rare procedures that do not have a set reimbursement rate. In fiscal 2023, Tricare paid some $183.3 million for 184 of those ""miscellaneous procedure costs."" The IG found in some cases Tricare might have paid greatly inflated rental rates for medical equipment in that miscellaneous category.

[UPDATED MONTHLY: MOAA's TRICARE Toolkit]

In one Tricare East case, the organization paid about $5,000 per month to rent a compression device for a beneficiary when another supplier advertised renting the same device for $675 per month. Still another supplier advertised it sold a different model of a similar device for $409.50, according to the report.

The IG said despite the discrepancies, recent changes to Tricare policies have led to lowered costs for the organization since 2021.",https://insurancenewsnet.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/inn-social-default.jpg,N,-1.0,2025-06-04 22:56:48.275695
