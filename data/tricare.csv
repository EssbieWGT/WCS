Svan,,,,,https://www.stripes.com/theaters/us/2025-12-15/delays-medical-appointments-overseas-report-20098431.html,"The report also found that personnel working in military medical clinics and hospitals overseas experienced burnout and low morale and were at risk of decreased readiness.
Auditors highlighted several shortcomings, including wait times for medical appointments that exceed the federal and Defense Department guidelines, the IG said.
Medical personnel told the team that clinics were not always fully staffed, particularly with nurses, who receive and prioritize messages that patients send to providers.
Moreover, the agency did not have a process to identify why some civilian medical personnel left for other employment, auditors said.
Though DHA agreed with the recommendations, auditors said they were still awaiting specific actions on how the agency plans to make a comprehensive review of staffing at overseas military treatment facilities.","The average wait for urgent medical appointments at U.S. military bases outside the continental United States was as long as three weeks in some locations and even longer for routine appointments in 2024, a Pentagon watchdog agency said in a new report.

Treatment delays that service members and their families face while stationed outside the United States increased the risk for negative outcomes and preventable complications and decreased patient satisfaction, according to a Defense Department Office of Inspector General audit published last week.

The report also found that personnel working in military medical clinics and hospitals overseas experienced burnout and low morale and were at risk of decreased readiness.

The agency reviewed 15 out of 79 military treatment facilities in overseas locations as well as Hawaii and Alaska, looking at 2024 data and conducting employee interviews.

The evaluation sought to assess how effectively the Defense Health Agency was managing care for its overseas patients, following the agency’s transition in 2022 to assuming full control of the Pentagon’s health care system.

Auditors highlighted several shortcomings, including wait times for medical appointments that exceed the federal and Defense Department guidelines, the IG said.

Between February and July 2024, service members and their families faced delays in access to care ranging on average from 1.2 days to 21.1 days for urgent appointments and from 7.2 days to 36.8 days for future routine appointments, the report said.

Federal and DOD guidance requires the military health care system to see patients within 24 hours for urgent appointments and seven days for routine care, according to the inspector general report.

While the guidelines allow for patients to be referred to a Tricare-approved civilian provider within the allotted time frame, finding care outside the military network overseas can be challenging due to language barriers, cultural differences and denial of U.S. health insurance claims, the report said.

DHA’s management of staffing at overseas locations is one area that needs to be improved to reduce appointment delays, the audit team determined.

Medical personnel told the team that clinics were not always fully staffed, particularly with nurses, who receive and prioritize messages that patients send to providers.

They also said that they had difficulty managing the volume of messages received from the online patient portal and that sometimes messages could be missed, putting patient safety at risk.

At one clinic, for example, providers did not see a prescription refill message and the patient did not follow up with another request. As a result, the patient did not take prescribed antidepressant medication for two to three weeks, according to the report.

At another military treatment facility, personnel said shortages in medical technicians led to canceled ultrasound appointments, delaying follow-on medical care and leading to an increased risk of preventable complications, according to the report.

Staffing data also showed shortages in personnel, according to the report. In September 2024, for example, one facility had only 27 of the 36 civilian personnel and 27 of the 37 contractors that it was authorized.

Another facility lost more than half its primary care clinic active-duty doctors between 2019 and 2024 and saw a 20% decrease in active-duty technicians, medics and licensed nurses, while patient workload remained steady, according to the report.

Hiring civilian staff, meanwhile, isn’t always an option due to funding and lengthy hiring timelines, personnel told auditors.

In 2024, DHA left some civilian vacancies unfilled because of budgetary constraints, and the average total days to hire in some locations ranged from 155 to 213 days, the report said.

Moreover, the agency did not have a process to identify why some civilian medical personnel left for other employment, auditors said.

To address staffing issues, the inspector general team recommended that the DHA director track data on why personnel are leaving military treatment facilities, review authorized staffing at its overseas locations, track support staff availability and better balance its workforce.

Though DHA agreed with the recommendations, auditors said they were still awaiting specific actions on how the agency plans to make a comprehensive review of staffing at overseas military treatment facilities.

The inspector general issued 11 recommendations in total, including directing DHA to issue finalized guidance to its personnel and better manage data discrepancies reported to the team.",https://www.stripes.com/incoming/ecvmvf-161225dhaphoto02.jpg/alternates/LANDSCAPE_480/161225DHAphoto02.jpg,N,-1.0,2025-12-15 11:56:30.711796

All counties are affected.

To receive an emergency refill of prescription medications, TRICARE beneficiaries should take their prescription bottle to any TRICARE retail network pharmacy. If the bottle is unavailable or the label is damaged or missing, beneficiaries should contact Express Scripts, Inc., or their retail network pharmacy for assistance.

To find a network pharmacy, beneficiaries may call Express Scripts at 1-877-363-1303, or search the network pharmacy locator.

If possible, visit the pharmacy where the prescription was filled. Prescriptions filled by a retail chain may be filled at another store in that chain. If the clinician who prescribed the medication is available, beneficiaries can ask them to call in a new prescription to any network pharmacy.

As a reminder, TRICARE beneficiaries, other than active duty service members, may receive urgent care from any TRICARE-authorized urgent care center or provider and do not need a referral. This allows beneficiaries to seek nonemergency care for illnesses or injuries if their primary care provider is unavailable because of emergencies. Any TRICARE beneficiary who reasonably believes they have an emergency should always call 911 or, go to the nearest emergency room.

Beneficiaries are advised to visit Express Scripts’ Weather Notices page for updates.

The Defense Health Agency provides health services to 9.5 million beneficiaries, including uniformed service members, military retirees, and their families. The DHA operates one of the nation’s largest health plans, the TRICARE Health Plan, and manages a global network of more than 700 military hospitals, clinics, and dental facilities.

Q3 2025 Results Reveal Profound Erosion The company's third-quarter 2025 financial report laid bare the depth of its difficulties.","The medical technology firm Zynex is confronting a severe financial crisis, with its shares plummeting to a mere $0.74. This represents a staggering decline of more than 90% over the past twelve months, signaling challenges that extend beyond operations to threaten the company's very survival.

In response to the escalating situation, Zynex has engaged the services of investment bank Province, LLC to evaluate strategic alternatives. A special committee of independent directors, chaired by restructuring specialist Paul Aronzon, is now tasked with assessing options for raising capital and executing a comprehensive corporate turnaround.

The most pressing immediate concern is a persistent payment suspension from Tricare, Zynex's primary health insurance client. Despite an appeal filed in April 2025, the suspension remains in effect, continuing to severely pressure revenue streams with no clear resolution in sight.

Compounding these issues, the company has entered a critical phase regarding its debt obligations. Zynex missed a $1.5 million interest payment on convertible notes, triggering a 30-day grace period. Management is currently in negotiations with noteholders to restructure these obligations.

Should investors sell immediately? Or is it worth buying Zynex?

Q3 2025 Results Reveal Profound Erosion

The company's third-quarter 2025 financial report laid bare the depth of its difficulties. Net revenue collapsed by 73% year-over-year to just $13.4 million. This drastic drop contributed to a substantial net loss of $42.9 million for the quarter. Furthermore, Zynex recorded a significant $30.7 million impairment charge related to goodwill and fixed assets. As of the end of September, the company's cash and equivalents stood at $13.3 million.

Analyst Sentiment Remains Cautious

Market experts maintain a guarded stance on the equity. The consensus rating among analysts currently sits at ""Hold."" The average price target from four covering firms is $4.90, with estimates ranging from $3.00 to $8.00 per share. These projections, however, appear at odds with full-year 2025 forecasts, which anticipate a net loss of approximately $40.6 million.

The upcoming weeks are poised to be decisive for Zynex. Should leadership fail to secure an agreement with creditors and attract fresh capital and confidence, the company risks descending into an even more profound crisis.",https://mdb.ad-hoc-news.de/bilder/bild-2407176_600_800.jpg,N,-1.0,2025-12-14 16:56:20.508842

KEY QUOTES: “People who are struggling with mental health can’t wait years to see if something might help through trial and error.
We believe this work can meaningfully expand access to effective mental health care.” Reva Nohria, Partner at General Catalyst “In research, we’ve proven that these powerful treatments work.
We’re taking what we know from years of clinical research and turning it into care that any patient can access.
Radial is focused on the care patients have long deserved.”","Radial has launched with $50 million in venture funding to expand access to advanced mental health treatments, including neuromodulation such as accelerated transcranial magnetic stimulation and rapid-acting medications such as Spravato. General Catalyst led the Series A round, with additional backing from Solari Capital, JSL Health Capital, Founder Collective, BoxGroup, Scrub Capital, and Diede van Lamoen.

The company is positioning itself around a shift in psychiatry toward interventional, brain-based care that can deliver results in days to weeks rather than prolonged trial and error. Radial cited evidence that newer approaches can produce significantly improved outcomes for patients with mental health conditions, including published findings showing remission rates as high as 78% in some studies, while emphasizing that the broader healthcare delivery model has not been built to support episodic interventional care at scale.

Radial’s strategy is to build the clinical and operational infrastructure that enables these treatments to be delivered consistently, measured rigorously, and reimbursed reliably. The company said it is developing reimbursement tools and decision support designed around modern brain medicine, aiming to help clinicians focus on care delivery while giving payers more precise outcomes data to support coverage decisions. Radial also plans to address what it described as gaps in clinical decision support and operational tooling that can slow adoption of advanced treatments across everyday practice.

A core component of the rollout is a national clinic network that accepts most major insurance plans. Radial said its clinics are set up to accept Medicare, Tricare, VA CCN, Aetna, Cigna, United, and many Blue plans, to make high-impact treatment combinations available beyond cash-pay models and limited specialty access. The company framed this approach as a benefit to patients seeking faster symptom relief, providers seeking more practical workflows, and payers seeking better outcomes and lower long-term costs for complex cases.

Radial currently operates seven clinics across six states, supported by a proprietary software platform. The company said the new funding will support national expansion in 2026, including growth of both its clinic footprint and technology partnerships as it scales its model for interventional mental health care.

KEY QUOTES:

“People who are struggling with mental health can’t wait years to see if something might help through trial and error. New rapid-acting treatments work in days or weeks instead of years. We’re seeing remission rates for depression of 50-60% and as high as 78% in some studies our team has co-authored. The healthcare system hasn’t caught up. Radial is here to change that. When we have tools for the right clinical workflows and insurance pathways, people can access therapies that help them get better far sooner. It’s a dramatic difference for individuals, for families, and for the health system that ends up carrying the cost when care drags on without results.”

John Capecelatro, CEO and Co-Founder of Radial

“Psychiatry is undergoing a transformation, but most of that progress hasn’t reached patients. The science is there, yet the infrastructure to deliver modern, brain-based treatments at scale is still missing. Radial understands both the clinical evidence and the operational complexity required to close that gap. We believe this work can meaningfully expand access to effective mental health care.”

Reva Nohria, Partner at General Catalyst

“In research, we’ve proven that these powerful treatments work. They change lives. The hard part has always been bringing them into everyday clinical practice. Radial was built to close that gap. We’re taking what we know from years of clinical research and turning it into care that any patient can access. Radial is focused on the care patients have long deserved.”",https://cdn.pulse2.com/cdn/2025/12/Radial-Logo.jpeg,N,0.0,2025-12-14 14:56:33.586000

We can't afford Select with our medical kids. Consider all your options.

As long as your doctor takes your tricare you’re good. I delivered vaginally, stayed two days, had an epidural, and my bill was $45.

I had my daughter when we were at Elgin. I switched to select to have her at the birth center, which I don't think is open anymore..?? I had to pay the $250 and they charged another $1,000 fee because Tricare doesn't pay them enough. But it was worth it to avoid the base hospital.

Accessing Virtual Mental Health Care with TRICARE

TRICARE offers a comprehensive range of mental health services, including:

Outpatient services

Inpatient services

Emergency care

Nonemergency care

Substance use disorder services

Virtual visits utilize secure technology, allowing users to receive necessary care flexibly. Thomas Turnbaugh, a behavioral health specialist at the Defense Health Agency, highlights the convenience of these services, saying, “You have several different options for seeking this care, regardless of which TRICARE plan you have or where you live.”

Eligibility and Requirements for Virtual Care

For virtual mental health care within the U.S., patients should first connect with their regional contractor to identify an appropriate provider. Those receiving care at military hospitals may also access some virtual mental health services directly at their facility.

Notably, active-duty service members require a referral and pre-authorization from their primary care managers to utilize these virtual services.

Overseas Access to Virtual Mental Health Services

For individuals living outside the U.S., virtual mental health services are accessible as long as certain criteria are met:

The service must be a TRICARE-covered benefit suitable for virtual care.

The host country must permit virtual health services.

The provider must be TRICARE-authorized and licensed in that country.

The provider must understand local protocols for emergencies.

Those using TRICARE Overseas Program should contact their regional call center for specific provider information and potential referral requirements.

TRICARE For Life and Medicare Changes

TRICARE For Life beneficiaries should be aware of recent updates concerning Medicare’s virtual health coverage. Starting October 1, 2025, most virtual health services will necessitate in-person visits at rural facilities in the U.S. However, virtual mental health services, including those for substance use disorders, can still be accessed from home.

Before scheduling any appointments, beneficiaries should verify coverage details through TRICARE and Medicare to ensure they are informed about their options. TRICARE will cover costs first if Medicare does not.

Requirements for Using Virtual Mental Health Services

To effectively use TRICARE’s virtual mental health services, individuals need the following:

A computer or smartphone for video consultations

A telephone for audio-only consultations

A secure internet connection

Referrals or pre-authorizations, if applicable

The costs associated with virtual visits are generally comparable to those of in-person appointments. Patients will need to account for typical co-pays and cost shares.

By Gizem Nisa Demir

ISTANBUL (AA) - Eighty-one women have now joined a civil lawsuit in Texas accusing a US Army gynecologist at Fort Hood of sexual misconduct during medical exams, as the army faces growing scrutiny over patient safety and internal oversight.

Newsmax reported Friday that the expanded complaint, filed in Bell County, alleges Maj. Blaine McGraw covertly recorded patients, engaged in inappropriate touching, and conducted intrusive, unnecessary exams while serving at the Carl R. Darnall Army Medical Center.

The civil case runs alongside an ongoing criminal prosecution, in which army prosecutors have charged McGraw with more than 50 specifications of “indecent visual recording” involving dozens of alleged victims, according to army officials.

- Monitoring case 'very closely'

Army leadership has acknowledged the gravity of the allegations. Undersecretary of the Army Mike Obadal and Army Surgeon General Lt. Gen. Mary Izaguirre recently visited the Fort Hood facility to review Defense Health Agency policies.

“Our ethical and moral imperative is to ensure deployment-ready forces while providing a safe and professional environment for all patients,” Obadal said.

“I’m proud of our leaders and medical providers for the swift action taken to initiate the criminal investigation and prioritize patient safety — all of which reflects their unwavering commitment to patient care and army readiness.”

A US official, speaking anonymously, said Army Secretary Daniel Driscoll has been monitoring the case “very, very closely” and ordered a fact-finding mission to assess conditions “on the ground.”

“It goes without saying that the allegations are abhorrent, absolutely counter to the values the army and the military try to uphold,” the official added.

McGraw, 47, has been held in pretrial confinement at the Bell County Jail since early December. Army officials say he was removed from patient care in October, within hours of the first complaint. Defense attorneys have not publicly responded to the expanded lawsuit.

A civil lawsuit against Army Maj. Blaine McGraw expanded this week when the women added claims accusing the gynecologist of inappropriate touching, covert filming, and other alleged misconduct during medical exams.

The development is the latest in a case already under criminal prosecution and now prompting official Army leadership statements.

McGraw, a medical officer at Carl R. Darnall Army Medical Center at Fort Hood, was charged by the Army’s Office of Special Trial Counsel with more than 50 specifications of ""indecent visual recording"" and related offenses involving dozens of victims, according to Army officials.

The expanded civil complaint, filed in Bell County, Texas, alleges McGraw violated state assault, sexual assault, and battery laws and harmed patients through intrusive and unnecessary exams.

Plaintiffs say McGraw took advantage of his position of trust to record intimate procedures secretly.

In published statements, Army leaders acknowledged the seriousness of the allegations and outlined steps being taken to review policies and protect patients.

Undersecretary of the Army Mike Obadal and Army Surgeon General Lt. Gen. Mary Izaguirre visited the medical center to review Defense Health Agency policies.

""Our ethical and moral imperative is to ensure deployment-ready forces while providing a safe and professional environment for all patients,"" Obadal said.

""I’m proud of our leaders and medical providers for the swift action taken to initiate the criminal investigation and prioritize patient safety — all of which reflects their unwavering commitment to patient care and Army readiness.""

A U.S. official, speaking on condition of anonymity about internal Army leadership discussions, said Army Secretary Daniel Driscoll has been monitoring the situation ""very, very closely"" and dispatched the team at Fort Hood as a fact-finding mission to understand the situation ""on the ground.""

""It goes without saying that the allegations are abhorrent, absolutely counter to the values the Army and the military try to uphold,"" the official said.

The civil complaint also contends that McGraw ""failed to document in her medical records that a rape kit had ever been performed,"" which the plaintiff’s lawyers argued interfered with subsequent criminal prosecution of an alleged assailant.

McGraw, 47, has been held in pretrial confinement in Bell County Jail since early December.

Army officials say he was suspended from patient care in October after the first allegations surfaced and that investigators began reviewing his conduct within hours of the initial complaint.

Attorneys for the women filed the expanded civil complaint shortly after the government announced criminal charges.

The lawsuit includes alleged victims from Texas and other states, reflecting a broader pattern of claims spanning McGraw’s Army career.

Describing Rubertone as an “icon in the Military Health System,” DHA Public Health Deputy Director Sean Friendly said, “His development of the Defense Military Surveillance System has tracked every military member medical encounter since 1997.
“Over 30 years ago, Dr. Rubertone created several important tools for military force health protection and readiness that are widely used today,” said Navy Capt.
“His unique skill set allows him to act as the bridge over the gap between information technology and public health epidemiology,” she said.
“I'm driven by a deep sense of service and a desire to use my skills to make a positive impact.”","Dr. Mark Rubertone, chief of functional information technology support for Defense Health Agency’s Armed Forces Health Surveillance Division within DHA-Public Health, received the Department of War’s Distinguished Civilian Service Award during a ceremony Dec. 3, 2025, at the Pentagon in Arlington, Virginia.

“I'm deeply grateful and humbled by this recognition,” said Rubertone. “Receiving this award is a testament to the dedication and hard work of the entire team I've had the privilege to lead and work alongside. It means a great deal to me — not just as an individual achievement — but as validation of the importance of public health data and health IT in supporting our nation's warfighters.”

The award is DOW’s highest recognition for career civilian employees whose work improves the efficiency and impact of the entire department.

Describing Rubertone as an “icon in the Military Health System,” DHA Public Health Deputy Director Sean Friendly said, “His development of the Defense Military Surveillance System has tracked every military member medical encounter since 1997. This system is critical to execute comprehensive health surveillance on our military family.”

Rubertone said the award is “truly a reflection of the incredible team I've been fortunate to work with throughout my career and in particular during the past 10 years at DHA. The success we've achieved is entirely attributable to their expertise, dedication, and unwavering commitment to our mission.”

Modernizing health data for readiness

As functional IT support chief, Rubertone led teams to upgrade tools used for tracking the burden of disease, injury, and illness among beneficiaries across the Military Health System.

Those systems helped public health experts study trends ranging from musculoskeletal injuries to COVID-19 and measure the effectiveness of prevention and treatment efforts. The data collected was vital for leaders in Congress, the Department, and the Department of Health and Human Services to set policy and allocate services.

“Over 30 years ago, Dr. Rubertone created several important tools for military force health protection and readiness that are widely used today,” said Navy Capt. Carlos Williams, deputy chief of AFHSD. “The impact of these tools on warfighter readiness comes from how they are used to track, interpret, validate, and communicate essential health threats that directly affect the force.”

Rubertone underscored his commitment to warfighter lethality, stating, “My work, at its core, is about ensuring our warfighters are healthy, protected, and ready to answer the call of duty. We accomplish this by providing data and tools necessary to identify threats to their health, track injury and illness trends, and measure the effectiveness of preventive measures.”

Air Force Col. Cecilia Session, chief of AFHSD’s epidemiology and analysis branch, highlighted Rubertone’s ability at translating complex data into clear, reliable information for commanders and policymakers. “His unique skill set allows him to act as the bridge over the gap between information technology and public health epidemiology,” she said. “As the DHA’s systems evolve to incorporate advances in information technology, he is the vanguard of modernizing and integrating our health data systems.”

Rubertone also played a key role in bringing data from MHS GENESIS into DOW's surveillance systems as the electronic health record rolled out between 2017 and 2024. That work helped link information from clinics and hospitals around the world to long-standing tools such as the Defense Medical Surveillance System and the Department of Defense Serum Repository.

In creating these tools, “his visionary ideas have been a cornerstone of force health protections and readiness,” said Dr. Shauna Stahlman, deputy chief of epidemiology and analysis at AFHSD. “His leadership shows that when we preserve the past with purpose, we equip the future with possibility.”

Data-driven service provides ‘meaningful change’ for readiness

The Distinguished Civilian Service Awards are reserved each year for a small number of career civilians whose work has a department-wide impact.

The award honors a career that has shown how advanced health surveillance and secure, integrated data systems serve what DHA calls “medicine for the mission” — protecting the force, promoting health, and ensuring the military remains ready to respond.

Data, Rubertone said, “has the power to drive meaningful change, especially when it comes to public health and national security.”

At the cornerstone of his renowned career, Rubertone emphasized, is his dedication in using this data to help the warfighter. “There's a constant challenge to innovate, to adapt to evolving threats, and to find new ways to use data to improve the health and readiness of our warfighters,” he said. “I'm driven by a deep sense of service and a desire to use my skills to make a positive impact.”",https://dha.mil/-/media/Project/Images/News-Images/9438883.jpg,N,1.0,2025-12-13 00:56:32.266507

25 News contacted Fort Campbell to ask if investigators are looking into his time in Kentucky. We did not get a direct answer, but the Defense Health Agency issued this statement:

“The Defense Health Agency is aware of the serious allegations involving a physician who previously worked at several military hospitals. We remain fully committed to fostering an environment of trust and safety within our health care system. Our priority is to ensure that all patients receive the safe, high-quality care they deserve in our facilities. To that end, we are conducting thorough internal reviews to ensure accountability and strengthen systemic safeguards. This includes reviewing clinical protocols, supervision mechanisms—such as the use of chaperones—and reporting and complaint procedures across the enterprise. Our goal is to maintain safe and secure environments for both our beneficiaries and personnel.”

- Defense Health Agency

The Army provided 25 News a statement about those affected by the ongoing investigation as well:

“The Army is committed to providing comprehensive support to patients potentially impacted by these allegations. To that end, we have initiated patient notifications, established a dedicated call center, assigned Special Victims Counsel, and created a patient support line to ensure those affected have access to the resources and assistance they need during this investigation, which we are committed to conducting thoroughly. We encourage anyone with information related to this investigation to contact the Criminal Investigation Division.”

Representatives John Carter and August Pfluger, along with Senators John Cornyn and Ted Cruz, sent a letter Wednesday to Lieutenant General Gregory D. Brady, the Army's Inspector General, requesting immediate action regarding Maj. Blaine McGraw, a suspended OB-GYN who worked at the Carl R. Darnall Army Medical Center.

The lawmakers described the allegations as ""deeply disturbing"" and said they, ""raise profound concerns about clinical oversight, command accountability, and the integrity of the military health system.""

""These accusations do not reflect isolated lapses; they point to potential long-term failures,"" the letter states.

“The Army and Department of War Inspector Generals must conduct an investigation into the systemic failures that allowed Major Blaine McGraw to continue in his capacity amidst multiple accusations of egregious sexual misconduct,” said Sen. Cornyn. “The allegations made against Major McGraw and how they were mishandled warrant a thorough investigation, and I implore the Army and the Department to promptly look into this matter, bring justice to his countless victims, and work to prevent another failing in the future.”

- Sen. John Cornyn

The congressional delegation is requesting an independent investigation that extends beyond a routine internal inquiry, given that the alleged conduct may have occurred over an extended period across multiple duty stations.

The lawmakers are asking the Department of the Army Office of Inspector General to examine how clinical, command, and Defense Health Agency oversight structures failed to identify and intervene in this case.

""A transparent assessment of systemic shortcomings, and actionable recommendations to strengthen standards of care and accountability will be essential to restoring trust within the military community,"" they wrote.

The letter includes seven specific questions for the Army, including requests for:

A comprehensive investigation into all allegations involving Major McGraw

Trauma-informed resources and victim assistance programs for former patients and families

Notification of the Texas Medical Board and other state licensing authorities

Identification of systemic oversight failures

Review of Defense Health Agency Graduate Medical Education program oversight

Assessment of medical supervisors who worked with Major McGraw

Evaluation of reporting pathways for patients experiencing misconduct

The lawmakers emphasized that military health system patients ""deserve confidence that their care is provided in an environment that prioritizes safety, accountability, and professionalism.""

The letter requests that the Inspector General keep Congress informed of the Department's findings and next steps in addressing the allegations.

25 News has reached out to McGraw's attorney multiple times, but have not received a response.
