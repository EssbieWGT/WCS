“After assessing the current state of referrals, DHA has decided to extend the referral approval waiver for many beneficiaries,” said Richard Hart, Division Chief, Health Plan Design, TRICARE Health Plan, at the Defense Health Agency.
These fees are waived for existing referrals with non-network providers in the West Region.)
You can also bring a copy of the TRICARE West Region Referral Approval Waiver Letter.
Visit TRICARE West Region Transition.","Do you live in the West Region? Do you have TRICARE Prime? You should know that the Defense Health Agency has extended the West Region referral approval waiver through June 30. TRICARE-authorized specialty care providers don’t need to wait for TriWest Healthcare Alliance to approve referrals issued by your primary care manager before providing outpatient care.

“After assessing the current state of referrals, DHA has decided to extend the referral approval waiver for many beneficiaries,” said Richard Hart, Division Chief, Health Plan Design, TRICARE Health Plan, at the Defense Health Agency. “This waiver extension will ensure that West Region beneficiaries can continue getting specialty care without interruption to their care.”

However, certain military hospitals and clinics have returned to normal referral processing. This phased approach is enabling TriWest to improve its referral processing system. If your PCM is located at one these facilities, TriWest will process your referral. Keep reading to learn more.

How does the waiver work?

Through June 30, keep following the rules of your TRICARE Prime plan. These rules are described in the TRICARE Choices in the United States Handbook.

Continue seeing your PCM to get referrals for specialty care, even if your PCM isn’t currently in TriWest’s network. (Note: The point-of-service fee waiver is also extended through Sept. 30. These fees are waived for existing referrals with non-network providers in the West Region.)

During the waiver period, you don’t need to wait for TriWest to approve your referral (unless your PCM is at certain military hospitals or clinics). However, the specialist you see must be TRICARE-authorized.

Here are a few key things to remember:

• Ask your PCM for a copy of your referral. Is your PCM at a military hospital or clinic? They may send it:

• Through the MHS GENESIS Patient Portal within 3-5 days

• In the mail within 3-5 days

• To a referral customer service office. You can pick up your copy after your appointment.

• When you see your specialist, bring the copy of your referral, dated Jan. 1 through June 30. You can also bring a copy of the TRICARE West Region Referral Approval Waiver Letter. This is available on www.tricare.mil/west.

• Not sure how to find a specialist? You can:

• Ask your PCM to recommend a local TRICARE-authorized specialist.

• See a specialist you’ve seen before, if they’re TRICARE-authorized.

• Search TriWest’s provider directory to find specialists in your area.

Are there exceptions to the waiver?

This waiver never applies to:

• Inpatient care

• Applied behavior analysis or Autism Care Demonstration services

• Laboratory developed tests

• Extended Care Health Option services

Certain military hospitals and clinics in the West Region have returned to normal referral processing. If your PCM is located at one of these facilities, they’ll let you know. They’ll send your referral to TriWest for processing.

If this applies to you:

• Access your approved referral through TriWest’s secure portal. You can also wait to get it in the mail.

• Your TriWest portal will have instructions on how to schedule an appointment with the assigned specialist. If there’s a problem or you have questions, call TriWest at 888-TRIWEST (874-9378).

LOS ANGELES, April 29, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- The Portnoy Law Firm advises Zynex, Inc. (""Zynex"" or the ""Company"") (NASDAQ: ZYXI) investors of a class action representing investors that bought securities between March 13, 2023 and March 11, 2025, inclusive (the ""Class Period""). Zynex investors have until May 19, 2025 to file a lead plaintiff motion.

Investors are encouraged to contact attorney Lesley F. Portnoy, by phone 310-692-8883 or email: lesley@portnoylaw.com, to discuss their legal rights, or click here to join the case. The Portnoy Law Firm can provide a complimentary case evaluation and discuss investors’ options for pursuing claims to recover their losses.

The class action lawsuit against Zynex, Inc. alleges that the company and certain of its executives made materially false or misleading statements and/or failed to disclose key information during the Class Period. Specifically, the complaint asserts that:

(i) Zynex shipped medical products, including electrodes, in quantities that exceeded patient needs;

(ii) this practice led to inflated revenue figures;

(iii) the submission of potentially improper claims attracted scrutiny from insurers, including Tricare; and

(iv) as a result, Zynex faced a heightened risk of negative consequences, such as exclusion from insurer networks and possible penalties from federal agencies.

The lawsuit further cites a report published by STAT on June 4, 2024, titled “How a device maker inundated pain patients with unwanted batteries and surprise bills.” The report alleged that Zynex operated an ""oversupplying scheme"" by routinely sending excessive quantities of supplies such as electrode pads and batteries, thereby enabling the company to bill insurers for significantly more than what would be justified under standard usage. Following the release of this report, Zynex's stock declined by more than 5%, according to the complaint.

Additionally, on March 11, 2025, Zynex announced its financial results for the fourth quarter and full year 2024, disclosing a notable revenue shortfall attributed to “slower than normal payments from certain payers.” The company also revealed that Tricare had temporarily suspended payments pending a review of previous claims. Following this announcement, Zynex’s stock price fell by more than 51%, according to the lawsuit.

Then I found if you click on Triwest HealthCare Alliance in blue bold text, at the top of the page in a red area it says—

“Live in the West Region? There is now a referral approval waiver in place through June 30, 2025. Learn More About the Referral Approval Waiver

Also, you have until April 30 to set up your payment info if you pay by EFT, credit card, or debit card. This is for TRICARE Prime, TRICARE Select, TYA, TRS, and TRR plans. If you miss this deadline, you will be disenrolled back to Jan. 1. Visit www.tricare.mil/west today.” —-

I have select and was told I needed referrals for certain services (after 10 years of never needing them), and had to scramble and still lost a provider because Tricare didn’t pay them. They’re a mess currently. I’d add a payment method anyway, just so you don’t get disenrolled, then call them and figure it out.

LOS ANGELES, April 29, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) — The Portnoy Law Firm advises Zynex, Inc. (""Zynex"" or the ""Company"") ZYXI investors of a class action representing investors that bought securities between March 13, 2023 and March 11, 2025, inclusive (the ""Class Period""). Zynex investors have until May 19, 2025 to file a lead plaintiff motion.

Investors are encouraged to contact attorney Lesley F. Portnoy, by phone 310-692-8883 or email: lesley@portnoylaw.com, to discuss their legal rights, or click here to join the case. The Portnoy Law Firm can provide a complimentary case evaluation and discuss investors’ options for pursuing claims to recover their losses.

The class action lawsuit against Zynex, Inc. alleges that the company and certain of its executives made materially false or misleading statements and/or failed to disclose key information during the Class Period. Specifically, the complaint asserts that:

(i) Zynex shipped medical products, including electrodes, in quantities that exceeded patient needs;

(ii) this practice led to inflated revenue figures;

(iii) the submission of potentially improper claims attracted scrutiny from insurers, including Tricare; and

(iv) as a result, Zynex faced a heightened risk of negative consequences, such as exclusion from insurer networks and possible penalties from federal agencies.

The lawsuit further cites a report published by STAT on June 4, 2024, titled “How a device maker inundated pain patients with unwanted batteries and surprise bills.” The report alleged that Zynex operated an ""oversupplying scheme"" by routinely sending excessive quantities of supplies such as electrode pads and batteries, thereby enabling the company to bill insurers for significantly more than what would be justified under standard usage. Following the release of this report, Zynex's stock declined by more than 5%, according to the complaint.

Additionally, on March 11, 2025, Zynex announced its financial results for the fourth quarter and full year 2024, disclosing a notable revenue shortfall attributed to “slower than normal payments from certain payers.” The company also revealed that Tricare had temporarily suspended payments pending a review of previous claims. Following this announcement, Zynex’s stock price fell by more than 51%, according to the lawsuit.

Full transcript - Zynex Inc (ZYXI) Q1 2025:

Conference Operator: Afternoon, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the Zynex First Quarter twenty twenty five Earnings Conference Call. At this time, all participants are in listen only mode. A question and answer session will follow the formal presentation. As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to Brian Prinobo, Investor Relations for Zynex.

Brian Prinobo, Investor Relations, Zynex: Thank you, operator, and good afternoon, everyone. Earlier today, Zynex released financial results for the first quarter ended 03/31/2025. A copy of the press release is available on the company’s website. Joining me on today’s call are Thomas Sandgaard, Chairman, President, Chief Executive Officer Dan Moorhead, Chief Financial Officer Anna Luksak, Chief Operating Officer Donald Gregg, President of Xynax Monitoring Solutions. Before we begin, I’d like to remind you that during this conference call, the company will make projections and forward looking statements regarding future events.

We encourage you to review the company’s past and future filings with the SEC, including, without limitation, company’s 2024 Form 10 ks and subsequent Form 10 Qs, which identify the specific factors that may cause actual results or events to differ materially from those described in these forward looking statements. These factors may include, without limitation, statements regarding product development, product potential, the regulatory environment, sales and marketing strategies, capital resources or operating performance. With that, I’ll now turn the call over to Thomas. Thomas?

Thomas Sandgaard, Chairman, President, Chief Executive Officer, Zynex: Yes. Thanks, Brian, and good afternoon, everyone. Thank you for joining us today for the first quarter twenty twenty five earnings call. With me today are Anna Loxovt, our Chief Operating Officer Don Greig, President of our Cyanage Monitoring Division, and Dan Moorhead, our Chief Financial Officer. Anna will provide an update on the appeals process for TRICARE and the other initiatives we are pursuing in pain management.

And Don Greig will discuss patient monitoring and the pending submission to the FDA for our NICO pulse oximodon. Then we’ll discuss the first quarter’s financial results. And before Anna discusses operations, I’d like to thank our employees and shareholders for their patience and dedication. And I want to offer our shareholders some clarity around our current situation and stock price. And clearly, our stock price is very low right now and likely lower than it’s really justified.

And several things have added to our current situation. As you all know, our business model is to obtain a prescription for patient use of our devices and then build an insurance company for the use. We deal with over 3,000 insurance companies daily and are constantly navigating challenges and obstacles put in our way in securing reimbursement. Recently, a new challenge was that TRICARE abruptly placed a temporary payment suspension while they’re looking into if our claims comply with their policies and guidelines. We are used to these kind of behaviors constantly over the past several decades and we therefore did not include bills to TRICARE in our recent revenue revenue calculations.

If and when this all gets resolved, it’ll get incorporated into our financials per accounting guidelines. We had a chance to meet with TRICARE or what’s called the Defense Health Agency on April 9, and we believe we presented strong arguments that we have clearly followed all current and existing guidelines and policies. They committed to providing a response before June 9, which was sixty days after the meeting, and we now have up to forty more days to wait. But, hopefully, we will hear from them sooner. As a reminder, we actually had an audit and completed an audit with TRICARE back in 2022.

And at the time, we made all recommended adjustments to billing and reimbursements that they requested. The evidence we outlined in our presentation to TRICARE strongly supported our consistent compliance with TRICARE billing practices, and we hope as they work through our arguments that coverage and payments gets restored. But, of course, we never know the outcome here short term. Not long ago, an accounting firm, called cheapest acquired Marcom. Marcom is our auditors or was our auditors.

And, that acquisition made it possible for short collaborators or short news agencies to skew the stories so that our it sounded like our auditors dumped Cynix as a client, which was clearly not the case. The mandatory eight k filing we we made made this narrative possible, which clearly did not help the stock price either. I want to emphasize that we are restructuring our business to run without TRICARE business in a worst case scenario going forward, trimming a lot of overdue fat in the organization and restructuring several areas of the business. Once this is completed later this year, we’ll be poised to get back on our growth track. We are refocusing our sales force on new revenue opportunities, which will help us grow even without trachea patients and will eventually help us get back to current revenue levels and even more as growing our sales force with more productive sales reps would drive more growth.

We also continue to promote other products such as bracing to our prescribers. As part of our cost containment, we have continued to trim unproductive sales reps and leaving territories open for better hires in the future. You will later hear in more detail about finishing up our game changing pulse oximeter. In short, we have completed and passed all EMC and safety tests, which was the last missing item that we were waiting for and will be submitting to the FDA in what we believe will be just over a week. I’m very excited about finally getting ready to launch this product into the world’s biggest med device market, which is pulse oximetry, a product that has no bias when patients have darker skin, a product that will not show incorrect oxygen data when there’s, for instance, carbon monoxide poisoning, and fundamentally we’ll be able to do the same thing as when hospitals take a blood sample to be sure that hemoglobin species are, what hemoglobin species are in the blood.

With our technology, this can now be done non invasively, real time, and accurately show levels of oxygen, carbon monoxide, met hemoglobin, and reduced hemoglobin. A revolution that would could replace old technology pulse oximeters as we will have the same price levels and form factors that hospitals are used to. Hopefully, shareholders will pay attention to our progress on the background of these recent challenges that we now have a clear path to turn things around and a clear path to continued growth in both divisions. We’re still confident that our noninvasive approach with at home pain management devices have real growth opportunities to provide non opioid relief to patients. We remain focused on ramping our hospital monitoring division, which represents a large and growing market opportunity with a better mousetrap in the pulse oximeter market.

Our revenue is also becoming more diversified with increased call points, more products, technologies, and more end users. We’re very optimistic about the future of SINEX as we have proven to be a business that can grow quickly and profitably. We think there’s a plethora of growth paths available in the years to come. And I will now turn the call over to Anna Logsak to provide a more detailed update on the operations and our status with TRICARE. Anna?

Anna Luksak, Chief Operating Officer, Zynex: Thank you, Thomas. As Thomas mentioned, we were notified by TRICARE of a temporary suspension of payments as they complete their review. In early April, we met with the health agency and supplied them with our evidence regarding their questions to billing practices, and we believe we supplied good information to their inquiries and provided strong evidence to dispute their claims and questions. We expect to hear from them in June or earlier, but we’re happy with the information and documentation we showed to their team. As a reminder, if or when the reimbursements begin begin again, TRICARE would be responsible for paying all of the claims that have been appropriately processed during the temporary hold, which would show significantly increased revenue once received.

We remain in network with TRICARE and are expected to continue processing new and existing claims for treatment for TRICARE patients. TRICARE told us that they want current and new patients to continue receiving care through this process. In March, we decreased overall staff by approximately 15%, mostly in our corporate office. We anticipate this, along with other expense reductions, will result in annual savings of approximately $35,000,000. Beyond TRICARE, we remain excited about several new opportunities for growth with various insurers, including focusing on new areas like personal injury.

Although it’s still in the early days, revenue is growing, and we’re excited about the possibility. Our sales force continues to drive a diversified product mix. In q one two thousand twenty five, we saw our non NexWave product order percentage increased to 34%, up from an average of 30% last year. I’ll now turn the call over to Don Gregg to provide a more detailed update on the patient monitoring business. Don?

Donald Gregg, President of Zynax Monitoring Solutions, Zynex: Thank you, Anna. I want to provide an update on the progress of our Nico pulse oximeter and the overall market opportunity for this product. We have successfully completed third party testing and are finalizing documentation for our FDA submission as we expect to file this in May. I would also like to spend a few minutes discussing why we are so passionate about this technology and the massive opportunity we believe is in front of us. We believe this technology will be superior to what is currently in the market, and will improve health equity across the patient continuum of care.

There are very few clinical procedures that do not use pulse oximetry. Pulse oximeters are used to provide clinicians with a patient’s blood oxygenation level in order to assess oxygenation status and inform next steps in care. A broader goal of healthcare providers is to ensure that any disparities in care are minimized to every extent possible. Skin pigmentation and thickness have both been shown to alter the oxygen measurement displayed when using LED based pulse oximetry, resulting in biases which can have negative impacts on patient care and outcomes. Laser pulse oximetry is not biased in the same manner as LED pulse oximeters, allowing for more accurate readings across all individuals regardless of skin pigmentation.

More accurate data results and improved care and better patient outcomes. We believe our Nico pulse oximeter will provide reliable and equitable care for all. LED pulse oximeters on the market today are challenged to provide accurate and unbiased results due to inherent technological limitations. This shortcoming risks compromised patient care, especially for individuals with darker skin pigmentation or comorbidities which put them at higher risk. We are working closely with key opinion leaders to broadly educate clinicians in every care area about the science of laser based pulse oximetry, which is the key element of NECO’s fractional hemoglobin measurements and the reason supporting the anticipated positive impact of this technology on patient care.

Additionally, ongoing and upcoming clinical trials will allow us to publish widely on the benefits of our technology. After FDA submission, we expect approval to take approximately six months, and this is based on FDA, data. We have been preparing for commercialization with an early awareness education campaign that is targeting physicians across the country. Our goal is to have a pipeline of physicians interested as early adopters to both evaluate laser based pulse oximetry and utilize NECO in their practice following FDA clearance. Taken together, NECO will hit the market following clearance with a strong foundation of clinical results and commercial development.

Patient monitoring is a multibillion dollar market that we believe will enter as a superior product that can meaningfully improve care to the broadest range of patients when they need it most. Zynex is pushing to be a key industry partner and leader to all clinicians and further demonstrate how Nico’s laser pulse oximetry technology inherently solves the current market challenges, especially skin pigmentation bias while bringing new precision medicine technology forward in the field of patient monitoring. We are incredibly excited about next steps as we have a clear trajectory to FDA submission and commercialization of this game changing technology. I will now turn the call over to Dan Moorhead, Chief Financial Officer, for a more in-depth look at the quarter’s financial performance.

Dan Moorhead, Chief Financial Officer, Zynex: Thanks, Don. Please refer to our press release issued earlier today for a summary of our financial results for the first quarter ended 03/31/2025. Net revenue was $26,600,000 compared to $46,500,000 in the first quarter of twenty twenty four. Device revenue was $11,900,000 and supplies revenue was $14,700,000 The revenue decline was primarily attributable to the temporary payment suspension from TRICARE and slowing order growth related to our focus on sales rep productivity and lower sales headcount. Gross profit in the first quarter was 18,200,000 or 69% of revenue as compared to $37,200,000 or 80% of revenue in Q1 twenty twenty four.

Sales and marketing expenses decreased 28% to $16,900,000 in the first quarter of twenty twenty five. The primary contributor to the decrease in sales and marketing expenses was our headcount reduction. G and A expenses were $14,400,000 in the first quarter of twenty twenty five compared to $13,300,000 last year. Net loss was $10,400,000 and $0.33 per share in the first quarter of twenty twenty five compared to net income of $10,000 last year. Adjusted EBITDA loss for the three months ended 03/31/2025 was $11,800,000 as compared to adjusted EBITDA of $1,700,000 in the quarter ended 03/31/2024.

Despite the difficult first quarter, we maintained a strong balance sheet of $40,000,000 in working capital and approximately $24,000,000 of cash on hand. With that, I’ll now turn the call back over to Thomas.

Thomas Sandgaard, Chairman, President, Chief Executive Officer, Zynex: Thank you, Dan. And although we received some unwelcome news at the beginning of this year, we are optimistic about the growth prospects of the company and the varying opportunities that we have going forward. We hope to receive a response from TRICARE here in the next forty days or hopefully less and we’ll continue to provide high quality service to those patients here in the meantime, as well as accepting new patients that are covered by TRICARE. Beyond the TRICARE issue, we are pursuing further growth avenues to propel the business forward. Our mission is to improve the quality of life of patients suffering from debilitating pain and or illness by providing the highest and best technology and service standards.

In pain management, we do this by providing a non opioid alternative to pain management, and our monitoring division aims to measure data more accurately across patients to provide more equitable healthcare outcomes. We will continue to adjust the cost structure as needed with the long term goal of generating revenue above beyond 800,000,000 a year. Looking forward, we believe we have additional customers and revenue streams that can drive further growth. We have a solid balance sheet with a strong cash position, and our historic profitability allows a high degree of flexibility to allocate capital in multiple ways. We have shown the ability to adjust to market, customer and reimbursement changes and continue investing in our business.

As for the second quarter, we estimate our revenue to come in at $27,000,000 and the EPS or earnings per share to be a loss of $0.20 per share as we continue to rightsize the business to return to profitability as soon as possible. With that, operator, please open the call up to questions.

Conference Operator: Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, we will now begin the question and answer Should you have a question, please press the star followed by the number one on your touch tone phone. You will hear a prompt that your hand has been raised. Should you wish to decline from the polling process, please press the star followed by the number two. Your first question comes from the line of Shagun Singh from RBC.

Your line is now open. Please go ahead.

Shagun Singh, Analyst, RBC: Thank you so much for taking the question. I was hoping you can give us a little bit of more color into the conversation with TRICARE. You know, did you get a better sense of why they denied coverage? You know, what kind of evidence did you did you present? You know, how do you feel about the decision on June 9?

And then, I guess, also more importantly, have you had conversations with other payers? Are they worried about anything? Could there be a domino effect? Any color around the conversations you’re having would be helpful.

Thomas Sandgaard, Chairman, President, Chief Executive Officer, Zynex: That’s you. Did not like to interrupt.

Anna Luksak, Chief Operating Officer, Zynex: So at this time, we don’t have any more information that we can provide. As we mentioned in the during the call, we we met with the Defense Health Agency. We presented our arguments. The claims that we received from TRICARE for payment suspensions are fairly vague, so we just presented our compliance with their guidelines and policies. Policies.

There are no other conversations with any other payers right now about any type of issues. And I also wanted to emphasize that this is not denied coverage. They continue to process our claims. They this is a payment temporary payment suspension while they confirm that the evidence that we provided and the arguments that we provided and following their policy is appropriate.

Shagun Singh, Analyst, RBC: Got it. Thank you. And then I just wanted to kinda touch on q one and guidance. You know, you guys gave us an update last month, I believe, March, and, you know, you guys missed q one. So so so what got worse?

What was unanticipated versus last month? And then also with respect to your 2025 guidance, like, you know, you you still haven’t, you know, provided that, but, you know, is there is is it likely, or could you consider giving us a look into the non TRICARE portion of the business and how that is doing or what your expectation is in ’25? Thank you for taking the questions.

Thomas Sandgaard, Chairman, President, Chief Executive Officer, Zynex: So,

Dan Moorhead, Chief Financial Officer, Zynex: you know, I’d say a couple things. So, you know, when you’re talking about the the revenue miss in q one, you know, there’s a multitude of factors. You know, it’s you know, we have ins and outs with payers all the time, and our revenue recognition is pretty sensitive to those changes. And so we had a couple of those in q one, and so we ended up a little short. I would say for the rest of the year, you’re correct.

We haven’t given guidance yet. We were waiting, you know, just to get a little more clarity on TRICARE before we do that. So we would expect to give the remainder of the year, hopefully, when we announce our q two guidance or our q two results in q you know, at the beginning of q three in July. But generally, I would say, you know, again, the rest of the business is operating as normal. You know, again, like we said, know, we have some things bounce from quarter to quarter, but nothing else that was, you know, super material in that period.

Conference Operator: Thank you. Your next question comes from the line of Yi Chen from H. C. Wainwright. Your line is now open.

Please go ahead.

Yi Chen, Analyst, H.C. Wainwright: Thank you for taking my questions. My first question is, could you please confirm that the first quarter revenue and also the guidance for the second quarter contain no payments from TRICARE?

Dan Moorhead, Chief Financial Officer, Zynex: That’s correct.

Yi Chen, Analyst, H.C. Wainwright: Okay. So if the outcome is positive, do you believe TRICARE will give you a lump sum payment that was due in the first quarter and the second quarter?

Dan Moorhead, Chief Financial Officer, Zynex: I don’t know that we’re positive on how it’ll come through, but they have Mhmm. You know, told us that that we would get reimbursed for those claims that haven’t been paid.

Thomas Sandgaard, Chairman, President, Chief Executive Officer, Zynex: We we know that all those claims, even some from the fourth quarter of last year, have been adjudicated, and and we can see that in the system. But the the missing thing is obviously the decision to to to open up for for the temporary payment suspension. So, ideally, that would be one or or a number of payments on the same day if they wanna spread that out or how that would would flow in a in a positive outcome, we we don’t know that yet. But the main main thing is, certainly for me, is is that we we we believe we have proven in in very clear terms that we have compliant with all all guidelines and policies that they have they have in place.

Yi Chen, Analyst, H.C. Wainwright: Okay. And if let’s just, you know, assume if the for whatever reason, the outcome is negative, will you stop servicing the TRICARE patients? And is there a plan are you considering a plan that would be able to, make up the revenue lost, with the TRICARE patients?

Thomas Sandgaard, Chairman, President, Chief Executive Officer, Zynex: To make up the revenue that that, else was coming from from TRICARE, that’s, we’re that by refocusing our sales force so that we will grow in other areas. They have so many hours available in a day, and if we direct them to other areas that we expect that to generate the equal amount or or or maybe even better revenues depending what clinics they hit. And yeah.

Yi Chen, Analyst, H.C. Wainwright: Okay. And last question. So if Right. Nico is approved before the end of twenty twenty five, do you expect Nico to generate a meaningful sales in 2026, or it’s more likely a 2027 event?

Donald Gregg, President of Zynax Monitoring Solutions, Zynex: Yeah. So we will launch Nico immediately once it’s cleared. And 2026 is the the year for revenue for for Nico. We will start with a controlled launch and ensure that we can build and service this for our customers. But 2026 is the year for revenue for Nico.

Despite a 3% year-over-year dip in total orders, the company maintained robust performance among its sales representatives, even as the sales team shrunk by about 39%. This strategic reduction was part of an effort to enhance sales productivity.

In a recent development, the company faced a temporary halt in payments from its major insurer, Tricare. After appealing this decision, Zynex anticipates a response from Tricare by June. Nevertheless, they continue to support both existing and new patients as prescriptions are received, following Tricare’s guidelines.

As part of its cost-control measures, Zynex reduced its workforce by around 15% during the first quarter, aiming for annual savings of approximately $35 million. Additionally, the company expects to finalize its FDA submission for the NiCO laser pulse oximeter shortly, viewing this as a significant opportunity to expand its customer base and diversify its product range. Looking forward, Zynex remains positive about growth prospects in both pain management and patient monitoring sectors.

Zynex Inc., a leading provider of medical devices and supplies, has released its latest Form 10-Q report, revealing a substantial decline in revenue and profitability for the recent quarter. The report highlights the financial and operational challenges faced by the company, primarily due to a temporary payment suspension from Tricare and a reduction in device orders.

Financial Highlights

Total Net Revenue: $26.6 million, a decrease of 43% from the same period in 2024, primarily due to the temporary payment suspension from Tricare and a 3% decline in device orders.

Income (loss) from operations: $(13.1) million, compared to $0.5 million in the same period in 2024, primarily due to decreased revenue and increased cost of revenue as a percentage of sales.

Net income (loss): $(10.4) million, compared to $0.01 million in the same period in 2024, reflecting the impact of the revenue decline and increased operating expenses.

Basic earnings (loss) per share: $(0.33), compared to $0.00 in the same period in 2024, due to the net loss incurred during the period.

Diluted earnings (loss) per share: $(0.33), compared to $0.00 in the same period in 2024, as the inclusion of potential common shares would be anti-dilutive.

Business Highlights

Revenue Segments: Device revenue decreased by 15% to $11.9 million, primarily due to a temporary payment suspension from Tricare and a 3% decrease in device orders. Supplies revenue saw a significant decline of 55% to $14.7 million, attributed to the same Tricare payment suspension and a reduction in sales force to maximize efficiency.

Geographical Performance: All revenue was generated in North America, with a notable impact from the Tricare payment suspension, which historically represented approximately 20-25% of annual revenue.

Sales Units: Device orders decreased by 3% compared to the same period in 2024, influenced by a reduction in the sales force by 34% to focus on sales rep productivity.

Future Outlook: The company anticipates a resolution with Tricare by June 2025, which could potentially reinstate payments and improve revenue streams. Additionally, cost-saving measures, including a 15% reduction in staff, are expected to result in annual savings of approximately $35 million.

Net loss for the three months ended March 31, 2025, totaled ($10.4) million, or ($0.33) per basic and diluted share, as compared to net income of $10,000, or $0.00 per basic and diluted share, in the quarter ended March 31, 2024.

Report casts doubt on Planned Parenthood's abortion pill safety claim,Nancy Flanders,,,,,https://www.liveaction.org/news/safer-tylenol-report-planned-parenthood-abortion-pill/,"Yet, for years, Planned Parenthood, its representatives, and its friends in the media have claimed that the abortion pill is safer than Tylenol.
Meanwhile, Planned Parenthood claims on its website that the abortion pill is safer than Tylenol.
She was 23 years old when she took the abortion pill during what would be her third abortion.
She explained what happened next: One day at work, I started hemorrhaging.… This was probably 8 weeks [after taking the abortion pill].
Around half of U.S. states are not required to report complications from the abortion pill, making complications difficult to track.","A newly released study on complications of the abortion pill claims that “serious adverse events” from mifepristone occurred at a rate about 22 times higher than the rate reported by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA). Yet, for years, Planned Parenthood, its representatives, and its friends in the media have claimed that the abortion pill is safer than Tylenol.

The study, “The Abortion Pill Harms Women,” published by the Ethics and Public Policy Center (EPPC), reviewed data from an insurance claims database that included 865,727 mifepristone prescriptions that were written from 2017 to 2023. Mifepristone is the first drug in the two-drug abortion pill regimen. Researchers found that 10.93% of those abortions caused serious adverse events, including hemorrhaging, infection, and sepsis, in contrast to the FDA’s mifepristone label, which states that there is a “less than 0.5 percent” serious adverse events rate. That data included single-payer insurance claims as well as Medicaid, Medicare, TRICARE, and the Department of Veterans Affairs. It excluded “transactions for which the insurer is also the provider (as is the case with some HMOs and much VA care), as well as cash pay transactions (which are disproportionately common for abortion).”

Based on this data analysis, that would mean one in ten women experience at least one serious complication from taking mifepristone within 45 days — 22 times higher than the “less than 0.5 percent” serious adverse events rate reported by the FDA on the mifepristone label, according to this study. The study authors state that serious adverse events in multiple categories were accounted for in the reported rate.

Meanwhile, Planned Parenthood claims on its website that the abortion pill is safer than Tylenol. As previously reported by Live Action News:

[Tylenol] is taken millions of times annually by prescription, and its over-the-counter sales reach into the billions of dollars. Many times more people are using this drug every day than are using mifepristone; it is therefore disingenuous to make a safety claim based solely on a comparison of raw hospital visit numbers for both drugs. It’s entirely possible that more people go to the hospital after taking Tylenol – because more people take it in the first place.

A 2016 study found that .056% of Tylenol doses sold resulted in a hospital visit. However, the new abortion pill study, completed using real-world data, found 4.73% of women who used mifepristone for an abortion ended up visiting an emergency room — an 84 times higher rate.

‘Safe and relatively painless’?

Kristen Farrell shared with Live Action News that her experience with the abortion pill was “the most horrifying and humiliating experience” of her life. She was 23 years old when she took the abortion pill during what would be her third abortion. She was told it would be “safe” and “relatively painless.”

“It was neither,” she said. “… there was the quick onset of excruciating, mind numbing pain. It was so bad that I ran to the toilet, calling on my roomate, to stay there with me. I felt as if my entire abdomen was being squeezed, crushed and wrung out like a wet rag. The thought that I could possibly die during an abortion crossed my mind, and I became terrified. The pain was so bad that I began dry heaving, groaning and crying, saliva dripping from my mouth. I remember blood and pain, nothing else. The minutes seemed like hours, but eventually, I passed something (I don’t know what) and the pain faded. I can’t remember too much after that, but a few days later, I was back to work.”

But while working as a waitress, the bleeding got heavier and heavier. She changed pads and tried everything to contain it, but nothing worked. She continued:

… I assumed I was hemorrhaging and tearily accepted help from some fellow cocktail waitresses who offered to walk me to the locker rooms. As we walked back, I could feel the blood rushing down my legs, for all to see. Once I got into the locker room, I locked myself into the largest bathroom stall and continued to pass massive blood clots. There was blood on the floor, blood on the toilet, blood on my hands. I can’t explain the fear. Through my sobs, my manager asked me if she could call an ambulance. I, of course, refused. How could I look anyone in the eye? I managed to clean up, wrap myself up in toilet paper and I drove myself to the ER.

Once inside and able to speak with medical personnel, I discovered the truth: ‘Not everything had come out.’

Farrell, like 24,563 women between 2017 and 2023, was experiencing a failed abortion and needed to undergo a surgical abortion to remove the retained body parts of her deceased child.

A year later, she still had complications

An unnamed woman shared her story on AbortionChangesYou.com, saying that after taking the abortion pill, she bled heavily for eight weeks before being rushed to the hospital for an emergency D&C. After the single mother of three learned she was pregnant again, she took the abortion pill. She explained what happened next:

One day at work, I started hemorrhaging.… This was probably 8 weeks [after taking the abortion pill]. I had been notifying the clinic I felt I was bleeding too long and too heavy. They always brushed me off saying yes you can bleed longer. Well, this day I couldn’t ignore it. I was changing tampons and pads that overflowed every 20 minutes.

To finish my shift, I stuffed paper towels in. Nothing would hold it until I bled down my pants in front of a patient. I made it home covered up with a jacket. I was feeling like passing out and asked my brother to take me to the hospital. I had to admit to him what was going on.

At the ER, she learned her hemoglobin had dropped to seven. A low count for women is anything under 12. A year later, she was still struggling with complications, including severe anemia that required IV iron treatments lasting four hours each time.

As use of the abortion pill continues to rise, the number of women suffering serious complications from the drug mifepristone will also rise, but without studies like this, the world may never know. Around half of U.S. states are not required to report complications from the abortion pill, making complications difficult to track.

The EPPC is encouraging the FDA to analyze the same data provided in its study analysis, and to consider whether the abortion pill should remain on the market with safeguards put back into place, or if it should remain on the market at all.",https://www.liveaction.org/news/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/GettyImages-458559027-Tylenol.jpg,N,0.0,2025-04-29 14:56:22.413547

Ernst uncovered that the IRS’s union secured a cushy telework agreement allowing employees to come in just two days per two-week pay period.
THE DAILY CALLER | Joni Ernst Reveals More Examples Of HUD Bureaucrats Bilking Taxpayers Ernst’s efforts to fight for taxpayers have earned her sweeping praise.","WASHINGTON – In case you missed it, Senate DOGE Caucus Chair Joni Ernst (R-Iowa) has been leading the fight in Washington to end taxpayer-funded union time (TFUT), the insane practice of requiring taxpayers to foot the bill for federal employees engaging in union activity while on the clock, including lobbying Congress for higher pay, negotiating telework agreements, and securing other cushy perks.

While data was not released under the Biden administration, the most recent report from 2019 showed federal employees spent 2,606,390 hours engaged in union activities while on the clock for the American people, costing taxpayers $160 million in just one year.

To uncover the true cost of TFUT, Senator Ernst demanded in December 2024 that 24 federal agencies provide accurate and up to date data. Ernst’s efforts have already uncovered the jaw-dropping details of the true cost to taxpayers at three federal agencies.

The Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) revealed an 11% increase in costs since 2019, racking up more than $400,000 annually.

NY POST | Nuclear agency had 11% increase in taxpayer-funded union time from five years ago, records show

The National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) similarly admitted that north of $400,000 was spent every year for union activity.

NY POST | NASA spent over $400K taxpayer dollars on union time last year

The real bombshell came from the Defense Health Agency (DHA), which oversees the TRICARE health benefits for servicemembers, who said its bureaucrats spent 87,000 hours on union activity costing taxpayers $3.3 million.

NY POST | Workers at Defense Health Agency spent $3.3 million and 87,000 hours working on their own union benefits

Because the data from these three agencies is just the tip of the iceberg, Senator Ernst sent a letter to the Trump administration requesting that the Office of Personnel Management (OPM) resume tracking and publicly disclosing the total cost of TFUT across government to provide taxpayers with a true accounting. The Trump administration has agreed and will soon publish a government-wide report. Ernst also introduced the Taxpayer-Funded Union Time Transparency Act to require the annual public disclosure of the cost of TFUT to the American people.

Transparency is an important step but Ernst has also introduced the Protecting Taxpayers’ Wallet Act to require federal unions to reimburse taxpayers for all costs involving TFUT to potentially save the American people more than a billion dollars over the next decade.

Her bill will ensure that no more tax dollars are spent on bureaucrats securing cushy perks as was the case at the Internal Revenue Service (IRS). Ernst uncovered that the IRS’s union secured a cushy telework agreement allowing employees to come in just two days per two-week pay period. To rub salt in the wound, all of the negotiations were done on taxpayers’ dime.

NY POST | IRS workers only had to show up to work once a week in person, before Trump took over

Last week, Ernst sent a letter to Housing and Urban Development (HUD) Secretary Scott Turner about how his department has been ground zero for TFUT abuse by bureaucrats. She detailed examples of bureaucrats launching real estate careers, going on beach vacations, and even sitting in jail cells all while allegedly on union time.

Ernst’s efforts to fight for taxpayers have earned her sweeping praise.

NY POST | Public-sector workers spent 87,000 hours screwing you — just at one agency, just in two years

The New York Post Editorial Board wrote about Senator Ernst and called her, “A fierce advocate for the troops as well as a staunch fighter against fraud and waste as head of the Senate DOGE caucus.”

The Public Labor Unions Accountability Committee, who advocates for holding public sector unions accountable, has applauded Ernst’s work and emphasized that American taxpayers deserve to know where their money is going.

FOX NEWS | MARY KATHARINE HAM: Teachers union bosses put themselves first, teachers and students last

Fox News contributor, OutKick columnist, and Senior Advisor to the Public Labor Unions Accountability Committee Mary Katharine Ham praised Ernst’s efforts and demanded that public sector unions be removed from politics. Ham also called out the true cost of public sector unions on the Ruthless podcast and the Guy Benson Show.

WASHINGTON EXAMINER | No more union time on taxpayer dime

The Washington Examiner Editorial board applauded Ernst’s Protecting Taxpayer’s Wallet Act in a piece calling for the end of union time on the taxpayers’ dime.

Americans For Fair Treatment, an advocacy group for getting union spending out of politics, has also praised the Protecting Taxpayer’s Wallet Act and called for its swift passage to bring a little fiscal sanity to Washington.

“You represent the epitome of our Military Health System as a servant leader in providing direct medical care, which enhances mission readiness,” Johnson told Crenshaw, one of 11 hospital corpsmen assigned to NHB with behavioral health technician specialty capabilities.

Johnson met Crenshaw earlier on a tour of NHB’s Mental Health Directorate on April 24, 2025. Crenshaw explained the facility’s wide array of outpatient mental health services, including individual psychotherapy, readiness-related psychological evaluations, and Personnel Reliability Program evaluations for Sailors, Marines and Coast Guardsmen across nearly 300 tenant commands in the Pacific Northwest.

Crenshaw, with other behavioral health technicians, pioneered a high level of clinical involvement, characterized by their engagement in nearly 115 safety checks, roughly 585 access-to-care appointments, and over 430 group therapy sessions and individual patient follow-up care.

“Doing eyes and hands-on patient care is something we need to codify. Very impressive,” remarked Johnson.

Johnson also met with NHB’s leaders and held an all-hands call for senior enlisted and junior officers to candidly discuss the current state of the Defense Health Agency in military medicine.

“As a Navy military treatment facility, your main support is to ships, submarines, and shore commands. The Army has its brigades to look after. Air Force has wings. Each service component exists for lethality, and our job is to ensure we’re medically ready to go to war, if needed,” Johnson said.

Staffing concerns and fiscal constraints were top topics of discussion during Johnson’s visit, readily recognized as a common theme throughout the MHS.

“There’s a lot of business in health care delivery, but in the end, it’s really all about connecting to people,” she said.

“We’re a unique health system,” continued Johnson. “We train and prepare to go to war. There’s no civilian at the front dealing with casualties. That’s all you. Dr. [David J.] Smith [Acting Director, DHA] and I appreciate all you do. Stay in the fight. We’re supporting you. It’s fantastic, all that you do, thinking outside the box to provide care with limited staff.”

As the DHA senior enlisted leader, Johnson provides oversight and guidance to enlisted service members in support of readiness and peacetime healthcare delivery missions.

She advises on the execution of DHA’s combat support activities, and she’s

This bill removes current barriers in TRICARE and helps ensure that all servicemembers can access the fertility care they deserve to start a family,” said Strickland.
“Our nation’s servicemembers and their families make incredible sacrifices every day, and they deserve access to the full spectrum of medical care to build their families.
The majority of Americans — 85% — support access to IVF, one of the most effective medical treatments for those struggling to build their family.
Expanding TRICARE coverage to include IVF and fertility care is not just the right thing to do—it’s a critical investment in the health and well-being of military families.","Today (April 24, 2025), during National Infertility Awareness Week, Congresswoman Marilyn Strickland (WA-10), led the reintroduction of the Expanding Access to Fertility Care for Servicemembers and Dependents Act, which would expand TRICARE coverage to make assisted reproductive services, including IVF, available to all active-duty servicemembers (including the Reserve and National Guard) and dependents – regardless of service-connection requirements, sex, gender, sexual orientation, or marital status of the servicemember or their dependent.

This bill has been endorsed by RESOLVE: The National Infertility Association, American Society for Reproductive Medicine, the Center for Reproductive Rights, and the Modern Military Association of America.

“Answering the call to serve often means making a great number of sacrifices for your country. Being able to start a family should not be one of them. This bill removes current barriers in TRICARE and helps ensure that all servicemembers can access the fertility care they deserve to start a family,” said Strickland.

“Our nation’s servicemembers and their families make incredible sacrifices every day, and they deserve access to the full spectrum of medical care to build their families. The majority of Americans — 85% — support access to IVF, one of the most effective medical treatments for those struggling to build their family. Expanding TRICARE coverage to include IVF and fertility care is not just the right thing to do—it’s a critical investment in the health and well-being of military families. RESOLVE stands strongly in support of this long-overdue change, and we urge Congress to act swiftly to ensure that no one who serves our country is denied the chance to become a parent,” said Barbara Collura, President/CEO of RESOLVE: The National Infertility Association

“For decades, the American Society for Reproductive Medicine (ASRM) has been a leader in promoting policies that expand access to fertility treatments like IVF for military families, who face unique family building challenges due to the nature of their work in service to our country,” said Sean Tipton, ASRM Chief Advocacy & Policy Officer. “We thank Congresswoman Strickland, Delegate Norton, Congressman Takano, and Congresswoman Pressley for calling attention to the fact that current Department of Defense (DoD) policy – which limits TRICARE coverage for fertility treatments to only service members with a service-connected illness or injury – fails to provide our military families with adequate access to care. It’s about time we address this shortcoming so that our brave men and women in uniform do not have to juggle the out-of-pocket costs for treatment with their service, end their military careers to access health care, or forego their dreams of having a family.”

“The Expanding Access to Fertility Care for Servicemembers and Dependents Act is a critical piece of legislation. By removing legal barriers that currently exclude from insurance coverage servicemembers whose infertility is not directly service-related, and safeguarding against discrimination in coverage of this care, the Act gets us closer to ensuring that all servicemembers and their dependents can have equitable and non-discriminatory access to the fertility health care they need to build their families,” said Karla Torres, Senior Human Rights Counsel, Center for Reproductive Rights

The legislation is cosponsored by Del. Eleanor Holmes Norton (DC), Rep. Mark Takano (CA-39), and Rep. Ayanna Pressley (MA-7).",https://thesubtimes.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2021/07/TST-Featured-Image.png,N,1.0,2025-04-28 21:56:23.170812

Several clinic owners in Moore and Cumberland counties still need to be paid for services rendered to patients who primarily come from military families.

Erin Skinner, an owner of the Thrive clinic in Southern Pines, said she faces the possibility of filing for bankruptcy.

She prides herself on giving the best nutritional advice possible to every patient she meets at the Thrive clinic.

“We opened as a group in 2021 as a group of just dietitians practicing functional medicine care,” Skinner said.

Which is why the mom of three said she couldn’t believe getting reimbursed for providing care to this population since the start of the year has proven to be so difficult.

“Mid-January is when we realized that our claims aren't getting paid. So that's the first time that we got any idea that there was an issue,” Skinner said.

Spectrum News 1 previously reported the timeline started Jan. 1.

Clinic owners and parents alike expressed dismay at the insurer’s struggle to process claims in a timely fashion earlier this year.

Issues stemmed from a transition to third-party subcontractor PGBA.

A partial statement from Humana Military earlier this year cited that the subcontractor improperly processed Humana Military insurance claims for patients under Tricare East, the health care program designed for military families.

PGBA incorrectly filled provider portals with incorrect information like old addresses, which meant it couldn’t file claims electronically for a long time.

Skinner said as of March, they had received two claims reimbursements from Humana Military insurance with hundreds of other claims left unpaid.

She said they took out a $20,000 loan to stay financially afloat along with firing a team member.

“The worst thing is like literally we're over $50,000 upside down this year, and we had to take out a loan to try to make payroll,” Skinner said. “We're running out of that loan.”

The nutritionist said it's not only affecting the number of patients they see each day, but it's also bleeding into her ability to see those overall because she has picked up more administrative tasks like booking appointments. Skinner said the primary care side can’t perform as many routine health checkups and other services.

“The patients are frustrated with the care not being as good and then the team is frustrated by being stretched so thin,” Skinner said.

Humana spokesperson Nan Frient confirmed advanced checks were mailed to the most vulnerable providers without defining the criteria for vulnerability.

Skinner isn’t a provider who received a check.

In the latest statement, Frient said:

“We acknowledge that our typical timeframes for processing claims have been delayed as a result of this major system transition, however, a very small percentage of claims submitted have gone beyond our contractual payment timeframe of 30 days. Claims have started flowing through the processing systems and payments have begun. We anticipate the remaining issues slowing down our claims processing and payment systems will be fixed by early March.”

A more recent development on the Humana Military website confirmed ongoing issues with processing of claims. A note was shared online on April 17:

“We want to inform you of a recently identified issue involving the incorrect processing of certain claims. Due to a system error, some network provider claims were incorrectly processed as if they were from non-network providers, causing incorrect payments. We are in the process of adjusting the impacted claims for proper payment. We appreciate your patience and understanding as we work through this as quickly as possible. Once claims have been corrected, an updated Explanation of Benefits (EOB) and remittances will be sent.”

More claims have been paid since the start of the month, but issues remain.

“Me or any other military family, after our service and everything we've done, we're not gonna be able to get quality health care like we used to be able to get, because clinics won't accept our plan because they know it won't pay,” Skinner said.

Skinner said she has received payment for about 45 claims since the start of April but more than 500 claims remain unpaid, including those from January to March.

“The event featured a series of expert-led presentations on topics such as shoulder labrum (SLAP) tears and return-to-sport protocols for athletes, ankle rehabilitation, as well as sleep hygiene and nutrition,” said Cpt. Kathryn Marr, a Doctor of Physical Therapy and chief of Munson’s Department of Rehabilitation.

Marr said events like this play a key role in ensuring military medical teams remain ready and on the cutting edge of their healthcare specialties, reinforcing the idea that medicine is a constantly evolving practice to improve patient outcomes.

“Things change. People are always doing research. New information is always coming out, so these events give us the latest evidence-based practices in rehabilitation and performance,” said Marr.

Marr was particularly fascinated with a presentation on a return to running program for patients recovering from stress injuries. She intends to share what she learned with Defense Health Agency peers and incorporate the treatment regimen into the clinic.

Beyond the educational benefits, the event served as a valuable team building and collaboration experience, allowing military and civilian practitioners to learn together and stay aligned on best practices, according to Marr.

The study raises serious concerns about the safety of the dangerous abortion pill.

The analysis, described as the “largest known study of the abortion pill,” was conducted by Ethics and Public Policy Center President Ryan Anderson and Director of Data Analysis Jamie Bryan Hall.

The authors maintain this is the largest ever study of the abortion pill.

It examined insurance claims data from Medicaid, TRICARE, Medicare, the Department of Veterans Affairs, and private insurers, covering 865,727 mifepristone prescriptions dispensed to 692,873 women between 2017 and 2023.

According to the study, approximately 10.9% of these prescriptions—94,605 chemical abortions—resulted in “serious adverse events” such as emergency room visits, hemorrhages, sepsis, infections, or follow-up surgeries within 45 days of taking the drug. This rate starkly contrasts with the FDA’s reported complication rate, which pro-life advocates argue has been dangerously understated.

“The women in our dataset receive (or fail to receive) pre- and post-abortion healthcare of the real-world quality that prevails in the U.S. today, not the carefully controlled regimen of care that ordinarily prevails in a clinical trial,” the study says

“This study is the statistical equivalent of a category 5 hurricane hitting the prevailing narrative of the abortion industry,” Anderson said in a statement to The Federalist. “It reveals, based on real-world data, the shocking number of women who suffer serious medical consequences because of the abortion pill.”

Pro-life medical professionals have long criticized the FDA’s approval of mifepristone, first granted in 2000 under an accelerated process intended for drugs treating serious or life-threatening conditions. Critics, including the Alliance for Hippocratic Medicine, argue that pregnancy does not qualify as such a condition and that the agency overlooked significant risks to women’s health.

“The FDA should reinstate the original patient safety protocols that were required when mifepristone was first approved. Doing so will likely reduce the harms to women and permit better monitoring to determine whether this drug should remain on the market,” the authors note. “The FDA should further investigate the harm this drug causes to women and, based on objective safety criteria, reconsider its approval altogether. Women deserve better than the abortion pill.”

The study’s findings come amid ongoing legal and policy battles over mifepristone.

In 2021, the Biden administration relaxed regulations, permanently allowing the dangerous abortion drug to be dispensed via mail and permitting pharmacies like Walgreens and CVS to distribute it. The FDA also reduced oversight, eliminating requirements for prescribers to report non-fatal adverse events unless a patient dies.

Pro-life advocates argue these changes have exacerbated risks, particularly as women can now obtain mifepristone through a single telehealth visit and self-administer it without in-person medical supervision. The study warns that this lack of oversight increases the likelihood of undetected complications, such as ectopic pregnancies or Rh alloimmunization, which can lead to severe bleeding or future pregnancy complications.

Last year, the Supreme Court declined to rule on the merits of mifepristone’s approval, citing a lack of legal standing for the challenging medical professionals. However, Justice Brett Kavanaugh’s opinion left open the possibility for future challenges, a prospect pro-life groups are pursuing in light of the new data.

The study calls for the FDA to reinstate original safety protocols, such as mandatory in-person visits and adverse event reporting, to better monitor mifepristone’s risks. It also urges a reevaluation of the drug’s approval status.",https://www.lifenews.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/ru48617.jpg,N,0.0,2025-04-28 11:56:35.636466

“The increasing dominance of PBMs poses a significant threat to consumers’ convenient access to prescription medications and pharmacy services, while at the same time charging taxpayers excessively and draining limited health care resources in public health programs like Medicare Part D, Medicaid, Tricare and the Federal Employees Health Benefit Plan (FEHBP),” said NCPA CEO B. Douglas Hoey in a letter to Rachel Riley, senior adviser for HHS.

The letter comes as Congress is considering whether to include PBM reforms in differing spending bills that have passed both the House of Representatives and the Senate and must now be reconciled.

Hoey said DOGE should work with CMS to eliminate or significantly tighten up the Medicare Drug Price Negotiation Program.

“We are concerned that pharmacies will have to float the program to the tune of roughly $11,000 per independent pharmacy per week; that pharmacies will not be paid fairly by PBMs; and that manufacturer refund payments to pharmacies will be delayed,” he said. “A recent study found that pharmacies could forfeit an average of $43,000 in annual revenue due to underpayments — roughly equivalent to a pharmacy technician’s yearly salary.”

Hoey cited reports by the Federal Trade Commission and the House Oversight Committee exposing numerous examples of anticompetitive practices that lead to higher drug costs, fewer options for patients and less competition in the retail pharmacy sector. He also pointed out that President Trump on several occasions called out PBMs as bad actors and that curbing their influence would be part of his plan for lower drug costs.

“It reveals, based on real-world data, the shocking number of women who suffer serious medical consequences because of the abortion pill.” The FDA, the study notes, derived its mifepristone data from 10 clinical trials.
In 2000, the agency used those trials to justify fast-tracking abortion pill approval despite ongoing concerns about dangerous and fatal complications.
When President Joe Biden took office in 2021, the FDA radically relaxed its already debated regulation to permanently allow abortion pills via mail.
Women deserve better than the abortion pill,” the researchers conclude.","Abortion advocates, their allies in the corporate media, and even the U.S. Food and Drug Administration insist the pill responsible for more than half of the nation’s abortions is “safe and effective.” A new, wide-ranging analysis of insurance claims regarding the abortion drug regimen, however, found that the rate of life-threatening complications due to mifepristone is at least 22 times higher than what the FDA and Danco Laboratories, manufacturer of mifepristone pill Mifeprex, suggest.

In the “largest known study of the abortion pill,” Ethics and Public Policy Center President Ryan Anderson and Director of Data Analysis Jamie Bryan Hall used purchased Medicaid, TRICARE, Medicare, Department of Veterans Affairs, and private medical insurance claim data to determine that 865,727 mifepristone abortion prescriptions for 692,873 women were handed out between 2017 and 2023.

Approximately 10.9 percent of those claims, or 94,605 chemical abortions, involved potentially life-threatening “serious adverse events” such as emergency room visits, hemorrhage, sepsis, infection, and/or follow-up surgeries for the women who had downed the abortion drug within the last 45 days.

That rate, which researchers adjusted to reflect “that some women suffer from adverse events in multiple categories,” is 22 times the FDA’s <0.5 percent estimation printed on the Mifeprex label. The researchers also suggest that the 45-day timeframe they used is “conservative, as some adverse events may present later (and studies relied on by the FDA used a timeframe as long as 72 days).”

“This study is the statistical equivalent of a category 5 hurricane hitting the prevailing

narrative of the abortion industry,” Anderson said in a statement to The Federalist. “It reveals, based on real-world data, the shocking number of women who suffer serious medical consequences because of the abortion pill.”

The FDA, the study notes, derived its mifepristone data from 10 clinical trials. In 2000, the agency used those trials to justify fast-tracking abortion pill approval despite ongoing concerns about dangerous and fatal complications.

The researchers not only warned that some of those trials are outdated and were conducted outside of the U.S., but they also emphasized the trials only included a fraction — approximately 30,966 hand-selected, “prescreened,” “generally healthy women” — of the mifepristone patients reflected in the insurance data.

“The women in our dataset receive (or fail to receive) pre- and post-abortion healthcare of the real-world quality that prevails in the U.S. today, not the carefully controlled regimen of care that ordinarily prevails in a clinical trial,” the study continues.

For more than two decades, pro-life doctors repeatedly asked the FDA to repeal its approval of the chemical abortion drug due to the life-threatening harm it causes women and babies, as The Federalist previously reported. The FDA repeatedly stonewalled the petitioners despite its legal obligation to address their concerns.

By the time the Obama administration was making its exit in 2016, the agency had worked overtime to expand the abortion pill’s use by changing its dosing, reducing the required number of doctor visits to obtain the drug, allowing more people than licensed doctors to prescribe the pill, and eliminating reporting standards for non-fatal complications from the pills.

When President Joe Biden took office in 2021, the FDA radically relaxed its already debated regulation to permanently allow abortion pills via mail. To further accommodate the Biden White House’s post-Roe activism, the FDA also permitted pharmacies like Walgreens and CVS to dispense mifepristone.

The study notes that as of 2023, a woman can obtain a mifepristone-induced abortion with “as little as one telehealth visit with any approved healthcare provider (not necessarily a physician)” and “self-administer drugs obtained from a mail-order pharmacy.” Even then, the study warns that a pill prescriber is not mandated to “report any adverse events unless he or she knows that a patient has died.”

“The FDA should reinstate the original patient safety protocols that were required when mifepristone was first approved. Doing so will likely reduce the harms to women and permit better monitoring to determine whether this drug should remain on the market,” the study concludes.

Changes like reinstating multiple in-person office visits, physician-only prescription, ultrasounds to confirm the gestational stage and rule out ectopic pregnancy, and mandated reporting of complications, the study suggests, could spare suffering women severe and even fatal fallout from the pill.

“The FDA should further investigate the harm this drug causes to women and, based on objective safety criteria, reconsider its approval altogether. Women deserve better than the abortion pill,” the researchers conclude.

Last year the Supreme Court declined to weigh in on the merits of the abortion pill’s approval, declaring that the coalition of medical professionals who challenged the Biden administration’s mail-order expansion of the drug did not have legal standing. The opinion penned by Justice Brett Kavanaugh, however, left the door open for the high bench to consider a stronger challenge if one should emerge.

The study examines the largest dataset to date regarding the abortion pill’s serious adverse events and is based on a HIPAA-compliant analysis of an insurance claims database that includes private health insurance, Medicaid, Medicare, TRICARE, and the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA). Researchers state that they reviewed 865,727 prescribed mifepristone abortions that took place from 2017 to 2023, following the official FDA definition of “serious adverse event” when reviewing the data. This dataset is 28 times larger than the combined 10 clinical trials upon which the FDA relied upon for the drug’s labeled risk.

The researchers also point out that “The data excludes transactions for which the insurer is also the provider (as is the case with some HMOs and much VA care), as well as cash pay transactions (which are disproportionately common for abortion).”

“Simply stated, mifepristone, as used in real-world conditions, is not ‘safe and effective,'” the study’s authors stated.

The current FDA-approved drug label warning is based on the results of 10 clinical trials that included just 30,966 women, 0.5% of whom reported serious adverse reactions. Some of those trials date as far back as 1983.

Significantly, EPPC noted that the women in the large insurance database it used for its study were “not a prescreened group of generally healthy women recruited into various clinical trials conducted at different times around the world.”

Study authors, EPPC Director of Data Analysis Jamie Bryan Hall and EPPC President Ryan T. Anderson, are calling on the FDA to revisit its previous research on mifepristone and reconsider the current regulation of mifepristone, which was scaled back substantially under the Obama and Biden administrations.

Anderson stated that the study “reveals, based on real-world data, the shocking number of women who suffer serious medical consequences because of the abortion pill.” In the summary of the study, the authors recommend: “The FDA should immediately reinstate its earlier, stronger patient safety protocols to ensure physician responsibility for women who take mifepristone under their care, as well as mandate full reporting of its side effects,” and “The FDA should further investigate the harm mifepristone causes to women and, based on objective safety criteria, reconsider its approval altogether.”

While Planned Parenthood claims the abortion pill is “safer than many other medicines like penicillin, Tylenol, and Viagra,” a study conducted by pro-abortion group Gynuity, released in 2021, found that 6% of women who took the abortion pill required a visit to the ER or urgent care for complications. That’s 107 times greater than the rate for acetaminophen/Tylenol (.056%) based on this analysis, and 33 times greater than the rate for penicillin (0.18%) based on this analysis. When compared to the new research from EPPC showing a 10.93% “serious adverse event” rate for the abortion pill, it becomes even more evident that Planned Parenthood’s claim is false.

Mifepristone was first approved for use as the abortion pill RU-486 in the United States in 2000 under the Bill Clinton administration, with several safety regulations in place. It was approved for up to seven weeks under the original Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy (REMS), which stated that women taking the abortion pill must have three in-person visits with the prescriber, who had to be a medical doctor. Mifepristone could only be administered in a clinic, medical office, or hospital under the supervision of a physician who was able to assess the gestational age of the child and diagnose an ectopic pregnancy.

Changes made to the REMS guidelines under Obama in 2016 and Biden in 2023 weakened safety requirements in order to increase access to the abortion pill.

Today, a woman can order the abortion pill with just one telehealth visit with any approved healthcare provider and can self-administer mifepristone that she obtains through a mail-order pharmacy. Prescribers of mifepristone no longer need to report any adverse events unless a patient dies after the administration of the drug.",https://www.liveaction.org/news/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/GettyImages-1428833382-woman-pain-hospital.jpg,N,0.0,2025-04-28 03:56:26.574401

Complaints from military families increased back in January when their health benefits switched from Humana to TriWest.

It's not unusual for benefits to change year to year but more often than not, the transition is smooth.

The rocky transition is not only generating complaints from military families, even service providers report having issues with TriWest.

Britt Sims owns and operates integrated behavior solutions in San Antonio, providing service to children and teens with autism. 90 percent of his clients have coverage with TriWest. Because of problems with TriWest, he says he's had to take out loans to keep his doors open.

After our report, TriWest responded with a statement that reads in full:

At TriWest Healthcare Alliance, there is no greater honor than helping our nation’s heroes get the health care they have earned. Paying provider claims accurately and quickly is a top priority at TriWest. To date, TriWest has processed more than $6 million TRICARE claims totaling $830 million, including 167,000 Autism claims – a particular area of focus for TriWest. We are actively processing and paying claims for dates of service in 2025, when we began administering the TRICARE program in 26 western states. As challenges with referrals, authorizations or claims arise, our dedicated team is working diligently to resolve any issues impacting beneficiaries and providers. TriWest is confident in our ability to get this right because of our long, successful partnership with VA. On average, we pay VA community care provider claims within 3 to 5 days to 99 percent accuracy. We are committed to reaching this same level of efficiency and accuracy for TRICARE providers.

Meanwhile, we are working to get answers on this still developing story including:

When will providers who took out loans to keep providing services to military families be paid the money they say they're owed?

When it comes to plans to address concerns, we're working to find out just how many people are on the TriWest resolution team?

How large are their individual case loads?

When can military families expect things to be fully resolved?

We'll continue to work to get answers on this developing story and others.",https://news4sanantonio.com/resources/media2/16x9/1280/986/center/90/49daedd1-4200-46c8-a21e-6f4513e9cfdf-SVTRIWESTSOT_VO.transfer_frame_536.jpeg,N,-1.0,2025-04-27 21:56:18.548248

Scenario for Tricare for Life Eligibility A patient would be eligible for the Tricare for Life plan if they meet the following criteria: They are a Medicare-eligible retiree or a dependent of a retiree.","Determining Which Tricare Plan to Bill

One effective way to determine which Tricare plan to bill for different patients is to verify the patient's eligibility through the Defense Enrollment Eligibility Reporting System (DEERS). This system provides up-to-date information on a patient's enrollment status and the specific Tricare plan they are eligible for. Tricare is a healthcare benefit program for military personnel in all seven uniformed branches, and eligibility requires enrollment in DEERS.1

Steps to Verify Eligibility:

Collect the patient's personal information (e.g., name, date of birth, Social Security number).

Access DEERS to check the patient's enrollment status.

Identify the specific Tricare plan (e.g., Tricare Prime, Tricare Select, Tricare for Life) based on their eligibility.

Scenario for Tricare for Life Eligibility

A patient would be eligible for the Tricare for Life plan if they meet the following criteria:

They are a Medicare-eligible retiree or a dependent of a retiree.

They are enrolled in both Medicare Part A and Part B.

Example Scenario:

A retired service member turns 65 and enrolls in Medicare. Since they have both Medicare Parts A and B, they are now eligible for Tricare for Life, which acts as a secondary payer to Medicare.2 Tricare for Life is specifically designed for retirees eligible for Medicare, providing coverage for coinsurance and deductibles.3

Billing for Injured Active Duty Service Member

If an active duty service member is injured on the job, you would bill Workers' Compensation rather than Tricare.

Explanation:

Active duty service members are covered under the military's health care system, but injuries sustained while on duty are typically addressed through the military's own processes or Workers' Compensation.4 Billing Workers' Compensation ensures that the costs associated with the injury are covered appropriately, as it is designed to handle work-related injuries. This is because Workers' Compensation is specifically structured to cover medical expenses and lost wages due to work-related injuries, ensuring that the financial burden does not fall on the service member or their family.5

Medicaid

Medicaid is a joint federal and state program that provides health coverage to eligible low-income individuals and families. Here are some key points:

Eligibility: Varies by state, but generally includes low-income families, pregnant women, elderly individuals, and people with disabilities. States have the flexibility to expand coverage beyond federal requirements, which can lead to variations in eligibility and benefits across states. The Affordable Care Act has allowed states to receive federal assistance to expand Medicaid coverage to more individuals who were previously ineligible.1

Coverage: Includes a range of services such as hospital visits, doctor visits, long-term care, and preventive services. Medicaid benefits are comprehensive and include inpatient and outpatient hospital services, physician services, and more.2

Cost: Typically low or no cost for eligible individuals, with some states charging nominal fees. Medicaid is funded jointly by the federal and state governments, with states having the discretion to determine the scope and cost of services.3

Tricare

Tricare is a health care program for military personnel, retirees, and their dependents. Key features include:

Eligibility: Available to active duty service members, National Guard and Reserve members, retirees, and their families. Tricare is designed to provide global coverage, which is essential for families stationed abroad or moving frequently.3

Coverage: Offers comprehensive health care services, including medical, dental, and mental health care. Tricare provides a variety of plans, such as Tricare Prime and Tricare Select, each with different coverage and cost structures.2

Plans: Various options such as Tricare Prime, Tricare Select, and Tricare for Life, each with different coverage and cost structures. Tricare requires enrollees to be treated at military facilities unless prior approval is obtained for treatment at civilian facilities.1

Worker’s Compensation

Worker’s compensation is a form of insurance that provides financial benefits to employees who suffer job-related injuries or illnesses. Here are the main aspects:

Purpose: To cover medical expenses and provide wage replacement for injured workers. It is designed to eliminate the need for employees to sue employers for negligence related to workplace injuries.4

Eligibility: Generally applies to employees who are injured or become ill due to their job. Employers are required to fund this insurance, and employees are not required to contribute to the cost.5

Benefits: May include medical treatment, rehabilitation, and compensation for lost wages. The benefits and coverage can vary by state, as worker’s compensation is a state-run program.6

Comparison Table

Feature Medicaid Tricare Worker’s Compensation Eligibility Low-income individuals/families Military personnel and families Employees with job-related injuries Coverage Comprehensive health services Comprehensive military health care Medical expenses and wage replacement Cost Low or no cost Varies by plan Employer-funded

Conclusion

Understanding the differences between Medicaid, Tricare, and worker’s compensation is essential for navigating health care options and benefits. Each program serves distinct populations and offers various services tailored to their needs. Medicaid and Tricare are both government-funded programs, but they cater to different groups and have different structures and requirements. Worker’s compensation, on the other hand, is a state-mandated insurance program funded by employers to protect employees from job-related injuries and illnesses.
