-- The updated program emphasizes evidence-based, individualized care with one-on-one counseling sessions for military-specific trauma and behavioral health patterns, complemented by group sessions designed to improve long-term outcomes.

More details can be found at https://onatreatmentcenter.com/tricare-approved-alcohol-rehab-facility

Alcohol abuse remains a widespread concern among military populations. National data shows nearly 900,000 veterans struggle with alcohol use, with combat exposure and post-traumatic stress contributing significantly to dependency. Studies indicate that approximately 85% of soldiers seeking outpatient substance abuse services cite alcohol as their primary issue, while an estimated 80,000 veterans report dual dependence on alcohol and illicit substances.

Ona Treatment Center's clinical model responds to these challenges through master's-level counselors who are actively involved in research and policy development in the forensic sciences. The facility offers a full spectrum of care, including medical detoxification, inpatient rehab, outpatient programs, medication-assisted treatment, cognitive behavioral therapy, dual diagnosis care, and family therapy—each designed to deliver among the highest efficacy rates in the nation.

""Our goal is to close the gap between academic research and practical care,"" said a facility representative. ""Service members deserve treatment that reflects the best of both science and compassion.""

The TRICARE-approved program provides substantial coverage for eligible personnel and their families, reducing financial barriers to treatment. All communications with Ona Treatment Center—verbal or written—are handled in the strictest confidence.

Despite disruptions in the pain segment, the firm sees potential for the NiCO laser pulse oximeter due to its differentiated technology and efforts to provide more equitable care.

Investment research firm Ladenburg has upgraded its rating for Zynex (ZYXI) from Neutral to Buy, setting a new price target of $3.70. The upgrade reflects increased confidence in the company's future performance, particularly in light of recent challenges in the pain segment and the potential of the NiCO laser pulse oximeter [2].

Zynex reported a net revenue of $22 million in Q2 2025, a significant decline from $49.9 million in Q2 2024. The company attributed the decline to a temporary payment suspension from TRICARE and slower order growth. Gross profit also decreased to $15.2 million, or 68% of revenue, down from $39.9 million or 80% of revenue in the previous quarter [1].

To address these issues, Zynex has implemented cost reduction measures, including a 14% reduction in overall staff, primarily in the corporate office, aiming for annual savings of up to $40 million. The company has also shifted its focus to more favorable payer segments, aiming to improve operational sustainability and drive greater patient outcomes [1].

One of the key drivers of Ladenburg's upgrade is the potential of Zynex's NiCO laser pulse oximeter. The company submitted the FDA application for the device in May, expecting clearance within approximately 6 months. The technology addresses accuracy issues in existing pulse oximeters and aims to unlock the $1 billion invasive lab-based co-oximetry market with noninvasive laser pulse oximetry technology [1].

The appointment of Stephen Dyson as the new CEO further signals Zynex's commitment to returning to positive cash flow by the end of the year and optimizing its payer mix to drive growth. Dyson brings over 25 years of experience in the medical technology sector and is expected to lead the company through a strategic refocusing [3].

Despite these positive developments, Zynex faces several challenges. The company's financial health indicates mixed performance, with a trailing twelve-month revenue of $172.4 million but a 1-year decline of 0.5% and a total revenue growth decline of 8.6% over the same period. Profitability metrics, including an operating margin of -4.43% and a net margin of -4.3%, highlight the company's financial challenges [2].

Investors should consider Zynex's valuation metrics, market sentiment, and associated risks when evaluating its potential as an investment opportunity. While Ladenburg's upgrade reflects increased confidence in the company's future prospects, the complex picture of Zynex's financial health and business performance requires careful analysis.

You don’t wear red, white, and blue in the same outfit. You don’t even own a Cricut. You’re just here to support your person and mind your business.

And babe? We get it. We’ve all mentally subtweeted about the welcome coffee invite (that’s pre-phase one in case you’re wondering). We’ve all side-eyed the FRG Facebook group. We’ve all whispered, “Please don’t let me become that person.” (Plot twist: you might already be her because you’re on your way to phase one.) Because the truth is… if you’ve ever cried in your car after a day care drop-off, rage-cleaned your entire base house at midnight, or sent a panicked text about Tricare and then immediately apologized for it? Yeah. You’re one of us.

Phase one: “I don’t need other spouses.”

This is the era of polite distance. You’re not judging anyone. You’re just… adjacent. You’ve got your own friends. You’re busy. The spouse scene doesn’t feel like your scene. It’s too pastel. Too perky. Too themed.

And then the deployment orders drop. Suddenly, your civilian friends are like, “Can he just say no?” and you’re wondering how to explain the emotional architecture of separation to someone who thinks “rear detachment” is a car part. You don’t want to need the group chat. But you find yourself scrolling through it at 2 a.m. anyway. Looking for someone—anyone—who knows what it’s like to hold down the whole damn fort with a frozen lasagna and a stress rash. Spoiler: they’re in there. Muted, maybe. But they’re there.

Phase Two: “Fine, I’ll go do the thing, but I’m not making friends.”

As far as phases go, this one is maybe a little easier? Mixer. Potluck. Unit Day with some egregious name like “Taco ‘Bout a Party!” that makes you want to disappear into the wallpaper. But you go. Begrudgingly. Arms crossed. Exit strategy engaged. And then someone else rolls her eyes at the cupcake contest and you laugh, too hard, too suddenly. Next thing you know, you’re talking about PCS horror stories and trading blackout dates like war crimes. You didn’t plan to connect. You didn’t want to. But something softens. And that’s when you feel it: the quiet relief of being understood without translation.

Phase Three: The soft launch (a.k.a. “I can send ridiculous memes and no one will judge me”)

You’ve worked through all the other phases, but this one starts with a reaction. A heart emoji. A “same.” Then someone mentions their partner just headed out for an FTX, and now you’re casually dropping a list of survival tips like a seasoned oracle of training exercise chaos.

You don’t even realize it at first, but now? Now you’re in. Suddenly, you’re one of the people who knows where to get good wine and which gate guard won’t check your ID if you’re crying. You’ve become part of the thing you swore you’d never need. And weirdly? It doesn’t suck.

Why we resist (and why it makes sense)

Here’s the thing: most of us showed up to this life with sharp edges and big plans. We weren’t trying to be “different.” We were just trying not to disappear into the miasma of being a military spouse. It’s scary to get close to something that might swallow you whole. It’s scary to be seen in a role you didn’t choose. So we armor up. We keep our distance. We pretend not to care.

But military life doesn’t ask you to give yourself up. It asks you to let others in. You don’t have to bake themed cupcakes or chair a committee or memorize all the acronyms. (Probably should memorize a few of them.)

You just have to admit (either on some late night or after a hard day) that it’s okay to be held by the weird, warm chaos of this community. Because this life will break you open. And the group chat? That’s where we hold the pieces.

You don’t have to love the group chat

But you’re already part of it, whether or not you have accepted it. You’re allowed to be skeptical. You’re allowed to keep your sarcasm (Also, all parts of the phases, too). You’re allowed to be a whole, wild, complex person who still doesn’t fully understand what your partner does for a living. But don’t sell yourself short by pretending you don’t need anyone. You do. We all do. You don’t have to become someone else to belong. You just have to stop pretending you’re the exception.

Because if you’ve ever cried into a load of uniform laundry, prayed there will still be leave left over to go home for the holidays, or sent a vulnerable meme into a thread of half-strangers who made you feel less alone, you’re not “like other milspouses.” You’re exactly like us.

LAS CRUCES, NM, UNITED STATES, August 1, 2025 /EINPresswire.com/ -- On August 1, 2025, U.S. Representative Gabe Vasquez (NM-02) concluded a productive district work period week in the southern portion of his district. Several events of note during the work period included:

Rep. Vasquez Stands with Service Members

On Tuesday, July 29, Rep. Vasquez visited White Sands Missile Range (WSMR), one of the premier defense facilities in the nation, the birthplace of America’s missile program, and a point of pride for those that call Southern New Mexico home. He met with WSMR’s new Senior Commander, Col. Andrew R. Morgan, and the two discussed the Congressman’s ongoing work to help WSMR secure federal funds to improve outdated housing and school infrastructure — enhancing quality of life for service members and their families.

“Service members at White Sands train tirelessly, work hard, and selflessly serve their country while living in outdated housing that is decades past its prime—that’s just not right,” said Vasquez. “That’s why in mid-July, I pushed Army Secretary Driscoll and Army Installation Management Command to dispense $7 million dollars to make much-needed improvements to service member housing at White Sands Missile Range, and I was promised those funds are on their way.”

Rep. Vasquez also worked to ensure that his bipartisan TRICARE Travel Improvement Act was included in the Fiscal Year 2026 National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA), which will help military families serving in remote areas, including at WSMR, access health care by reducing the travel reimbursement threshold under TRICARE Prime from 100 miles to 50 miles for active-duty service members and their families. As a member of the House Armed Services Committee, Rep. Vasquez helped advance the bill out of Committee with strong bipartisan support and it now awaits consideration by the full House.

Rep. Vasquez and Col. Morgan also discussed the Congressman’s efforts to secure $38.5 million for a power generating microgrid at WSMR under the FY 2026 NDAA, which Col. Morgan said was necessary as WSMR “looks forward to the future.”

Rep. Vasquez Pushes for More Affordable Housing

On Tuesday, July 29, Rep. Vasquez also met with Alamogordo officials, advocates, and residents to find real solutions to lower housing costs and keep homes within reach for working families.

“One in 6 homes in New Mexico are mobile homes, making the scale of this affordability issue enormous,” said Vasquez. “I refuse to sit by and let greedy, negligent landlords from out-of-state price gouge mobile home rental prices, driving our neighbors out of the homes and communities they have known all their lives.”

In the coming weeks, Rep. Vasquez will introduce his Keep Mobile Homes Affordable Act to ensure that outside investor groups do not purchase outsized numbers of mobile homes and pads to drastically increase the rent and price out current residents.

Rep. Vasquez Celebrates Public Lands Victory

On Wednesday, July 30, Rep. Vasquez visited White Sands National Park — marking his first official public lands visit since he successfully led a bipartisan push to protect 3.3 million acres of public land across New Mexico and ten other states from being sold under the Republican tax plan.

During the visit, he had the opportunity to talk with National Park Service staff about the ongoing funding and staffing shortages national parks are facing, the impact the park has on southern New Mexico’s economy, and his commitment to continue advocating for our public lands in Congress.

“Places like White Sands National Park are a reminder of why New Mexico is called the Land of Enchantment and why it’s vital to keep public lands in public hands,” said Vasquez. “I’m proud that my bipartisan Public Lands Caucus won a major victory in preventing Senator Lee’s attempt to sell 3.3 million acres of our public land, and we will keep working to preserve these treasured lands for future generations.”

The visit concluded with a special treat: a chance to see the oldest human footprint in the United States.

Exercise Ultimate Caduceus 2025, involving about 1,000 military and civilian personnel, began July 21, 2025, and continued until today.

“The exercise created realistic crisis scenarios that prompted a large-scale military patient movement response from within the Indo-Pacific region,” said Air Force Col. Christopher Backus, command surgeon, U.S. Transportation Command. “Ultimate Caduceus will assess Transcom’s ability and capacity to conduct global patient movement at scale and in a field training environment.”

Patients were received at Joint Base Pearl Harbor-Hickam, Hawaii, and Travis Air Force Base, California, and then transported to federal coordinating centers and medical facilities in and around Honolulu, Sacramento, California, and Albuquerque, New Mexico, said Army Maj. Latoya Toler, exercise branch chief, Transcom surgeon general.

Besides Transcom, other personnel involved in the exercise are from U.S. Northern Command, U.S. Indo-Pacific Command, Air Force aeromedical evacuation crews, Army Reserve Medical Command critical care air transport teams, Department of Veterans Affairs, Defense Health Agency, Department of Health and Human Services, as well as other regional health care and emergency response teams.

“Ultimate Caduceus is a great opportunity for DHA to highlight our ability to deliver both health care to warfighters and capability to combatant commanders as a combat support agency. At the enterprise level, we remain focused on aligning military health and private sector resources against warfighter requirements and optimizing patient demand on transportation assets,” said Anthony Ross, Defense Health Agency liaison officer to Transcom.

This exercise actively tested how the emergency response teams work together as part of the National Disaster Medical System to save lives during a potential national crisis.

“Success to me is to increase interoperability across medical teams and systems so we can provide the highest level of care to those who need it most,” Backus said.

As the DOD’s sole manager for global patient movement, Transcom leads aeromedical evacuation missions using high-capacity aircraft and en route care teams to transport personnel from the field to definitive care anywhere in the world.

“This joint and combined DOD, interagency and civilian partner medical team is something to be proud of and you can be assured they’ll move mountains to bring premier care to those who need it,” Backus said.

More than 20 civilian hospitals participated, which is the most integrated into an Ultimate Caduceus exercise, said Nicole Hardy, Transcom’s Ultimate Caduceus program manager.

“There was also significant rotary wing participation from civilian emergency response teams,” Hardy said.

MIT Lincoln Laboratory participated in the exercise to streamline patient movement data using artificial intelligence and machine learning, said Mark Barnes, Transcom’s liaison to MIT Lincoln Laboratory.

“We’re working to build an interconnected bridge between systems allowing for instantaneous data aggregation and dissemination,” Barnes said.

“Ultimate Caduceus is an annual patient movement exercise,” Hardy added. “Exercises have focused on troop patient transfer from the Indo-Pacific in the past, as well as patient movement from the Middle East and Europe.”",https://www.eurasiareview.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/a-7.jpg,N,0.0,2025-08-02 17:56:08.491168

“I believe my accomplishments at the 2025 ATA World Championships demonstrate the best of two worlds: service to country and mastery of self.”","FORT DETRICK, Md. - Lethality and readiness are the driving forces behind innovation in military medicine at the Defense Health Agency Research & Development-Medical Research and Development Command. These principles not only guide the development of life-saving vaccines, pharmaceuticals, medical devices, and equipment but also serve as a standard of excellence for the individuals who serve at the command. Col. Robert Carter, DHA R&D-MRDC’s chief of staff, recently exemplified these principles by earning top honors at the 2025 American Taekwondo Association International World Championships.

Drs. Robert and Kirti Carter, along with their daughter, Rajshri, embody a family-focused commitment to ATA Martial Arts, earning their black belts together and achieving numerous state and district titles while navigating the challenges of frequent military relocations. Their journey, which began in 2017 at an ATA school in Orlando, Florida, exemplifies the ATA motto, “A family that kicks together, stays together,” highlighting how martial arts can unite families and inspire excellence across generations.

At the 2025 ATA International World Championships, held July 22-27 in Phoenix, Carter secured gold medals in both creative and Xtreme forms and silver medals in traditional sparring and Xtreme weapons. The annual event is one of the largest and most prestigious martial arts tournaments in the world, drawing more than 3,000 elite martial artists from over 25 countries.

Carter’s performance was a standout in this world-class competition. Grandmaster MK Lee, the presiding grandmaster of ATA Martial Arts, described Carter as “a warrior, someone who is willing to express true feeling in action.” Judges praised his precise, high-energy forms and strategic sparring, as well as his Xtreme forms and weapons routines, which combine acrobatic technique with martial application and performance flair.

“Winning isn’t just about crossing the finish line first — it’s about the years of grit, sacrifice, and relentless belief that got you there,” said Lt. Col. (Ret.) Noel Lynkew, 2024 World Champion.

“As a teammate, he’s sharp, steady, and always has your back, just like in the dojo. You couldn’t ask for a better partner in or out of the ring,” said Col. (Ret.) Marion Grant, 2024 World Champion.

“Col. Carter embodies the spirit of the ATA — discipline, perseverance, and excellence,” said Uriah Breunig, owner of Infinity Martial Arts of Washington, D.C., which Carter represented at the event. “He trains with precision, leads with humility, and competes with heart. His victories on the world stage reflect what’s possible when martial arts and leadership come together. He’s an inspiration to everyone in our school and far beyond,” said Master John Faett of Leesburg, Virginia.

In addition to his role as DHA R&D-MRDC’s chief of staff, Carter serves as the biochemistry and physiology consultant to the Army surgeon general. His previous assignments include White House social aide to the president, MRDC liaison officer, and medical modernization and research, development, and acquisition advisor to the executive deputy to the commanding general, Army Futures Command Headquarters in Austin, Texas.

Carter credits his achievement to his dedication to the shared ethos between martial arts and the armed forces — honor, perseverance, self-discipline, and leadership.

“The structure and values of military service complement the discipline of martial arts training,” Carter said. “I believe my accomplishments at the 2025 ATA World Championships demonstrate the best of two worlds: service to country and mastery of self.”",https://api.army.mil/e2/c/images/2025/07/31/583bde31/max1200.jpg,N,0.0,2025-08-02 02:56:11.619569

During the recent earnings call, Zynex Inc. faced a challenging landscape, with significant hurdles overshadowing positive developments. The sentiment conveyed was one of cautious optimism, as the company grapples with a notable revenue decline and ongoing issues with TRICARE payments. Despite these challenges, Zynex is making strategic efforts to refocus its business and reduce costs, although the current market conditions present substantial headwinds.

Cost Reduction Initiatives

Zynex Inc. announced a strategic move to cut overall expenses by approximately $40 million annually. This reduction is to be achieved through improved supply chain management and a more diversified prescriber and payer customer base. These cost-cutting measures are part of the company’s broader strategy to navigate the current financial challenges and position itself for future growth.

Introduction of New CEO

The appointment of Steven Dyson as the new CEO marks a significant leadership change at Zynex. With over 25 years of experience in the medical technology sector, Dyson is expected to steer the company towards a renewed focus on growth and strategic realignment. His leadership is anticipated to bring fresh perspectives and drive the company’s business strategy forward.

FDA Submission for NiCO Pulse Oximeter

Zynex has submitted its NiCO laser pulse oximeter to the FDA, which could be a potential game-changer in the pulse oximetry market. This submission aims to address accuracy issues prevalent in current technologies, marking a significant milestone for the company in its product development efforts.

Revenue Decline

The company reported a sharp decline in net revenue, falling to $22.3 million from $49.9 million in the second quarter of 2024. This decrease is primarily attributed to the temporary suspension of payments from TRICARE and reductions in the sales force, highlighting the financial challenges Zynex is currently facing.

TRICARE Payment Suspension

The ongoing suspension of payments from TRICARE continues to impact Zynex’s revenue. Despite maintaining patient services, the lack of payments has created a significant financial strain, contributing to the company’s current revenue challenges.

Net Loss for the Quarter

Zynex posted a net loss of $20 million for the quarter, with more than half of this loss attributed to a noncash adjustment to the tax allowance. This financial result underscores the company’s current economic difficulties and the need for strategic adjustments.

Sales Force and Marketing Challenges

The company experienced a 45% reduction in sales and marketing expenses due to headcount reductions. This decrease reflects the challenges Zynex faces in maintaining sales force productivity and market impact amid ongoing financial pressures.

Forward-Looking Guidance

Looking ahead, Zynex has expressed a cautious financial outlook. The company aims to continue reducing expenses by approximately $40 million annually through staff reductions and operational realignment. Despite suspending quarterly guidance, Zynex remains optimistic about the potential market impact of its NiCO pulse oximeter, which is currently under FDA review. The transition to new leadership under CEO Steven Dyson is expected to bring strategic changes and potentially improve the company’s financial trajectory.

In summary, Zynex Inc.’s recent earnings call highlighted significant challenges, including a sharp revenue decline and ongoing TRICARE payment issues. Despite these hurdles, the company is taking strategic steps to reduce costs and refocus its business under new leadership. The submission of the NiCO pulse oximeter to the FDA represents a potential growth opportunity, although the financial outlook remains cautious as the company navigates these turbulent times.",https://blog.tipranks.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/shutterstock_1917115745-750x406.jpg,N,0.0,2025-08-01 22:56:09.744973

Matthew Case, Chief of the Navy Medical Service Corps (MSC) and Acting Assistant Director for Healthcare Administration for the Defense Health Agency, visited Navy Medicine Readiness and Training Command (NMRTC) Twentynine Palms on July 30 to commemorate the corps’ 78th birthday and highlight the continued importance of military medical readiness in an increasingly challenging global environment.

Over the course of his visit, Case toured key facilities, including the hospital and Adult Medical Care Clinic to learn firsthand how the command helps keep the warfighter in the fight. He met with NMRTC Twentynine Palms commanding officer Capt. Janiese Cleckley, executive officer Capt. Candace Foura, acting command master chief Senior Chief Hospital Corpsman Matthew Ritchie, and Marine Corps Air Ground Combat Center commanding general Maj. Gen. Mark Clingan to discuss how the command bolsters medical readiness while delivering high-quality care to service members and their families.

The two-star admiral’s visit centered on celebrating the MSC’s’ legacy while addressing the challenges and responsibilities ahead for both Navy Medicine and the Defense Health Agency as a whole. During a traditional cake-cutting ceremony, Rear Adm. Case, the most senior MSC officer present, joined Lt. j.g. David Naiman, the youngest MSC officer, along with Capt. Cleckley and the command’s director for administration Cmdr. William “Bill” Lawson, to cut the ceremonial birthday cake together — marking 78 years of the Medical Service Corps.

Case also hosted an all-hands call with MSC officers at Robert E. Bush Naval Hospital, with Navy Medicine Readiness and Training Detachment (NMRTD) China Lake and NMRTD Bridgeport Sailors attending virtually.

“We have an incredible mission,” Case told the assembled officers. “We have to be prepared for the fight tonight—not tomorrow, but tonight. Because, we do have adversaries in the world that threaten us.”

Case outlined four strategic priorities that guide the MSC: warfighting requirements, force generation, force preservation and force development. He emphasized the need to balance direct patient care with long-term operational readiness.

“These areas are all connected,” he said. “We’re generating and preserving force, we’re developing ourselves and our teams, and we’re standing ready to fight. That’s what we do.”

The visit came as part of a larger effort by Navy Medicine leadership to stay connected with front-line personnel. Case’s stop at the Twentynine Palms installation underscored the vital role MSC officers play in supporting both healthcare delivery and the warfighter mission — especially in remote and resource-limited environments.

He also touched on the Navy’s laser focus in the Pacific region, noting the importance of ensuring medical support remains agile, distributed and capable across long distances.

“Pacific operations are at the center of our planning,” he said. “We must maintain the same standard of care in forward-deployed environments as we do in major medical centers.”

Case encouraged ongoing professional development and the power of learning every day, urging officers and all Sailors to take advantage of every learning opportunity to better serve the fleet and their country.

“Our adversaries can outnumber us, but they will never outsmart us. That, and the fact that we are a volunteer fighting force–not a conscripted one–is what makes us the leading military in the world.”

Case also emphasized the critical role military families play in supporting service members' missions, describing military service as ""a package deal"" that affects entire families through frequent relocations, deployments and the uncertainties of military life.

""Sometimes the stuff we get to do is kind of cool, but our spouses and loved ones are dealing with other things, trying to move forward, maybe going to school for the first time or going to a new school for the seventh time,"" Case said, encouraging service members to actively thank their families for their support.

Established in 1947, the Navy Medical Service Corps is composed of healthcare administrators, clinical specialists and support personnel who enable the delivery of care across the fleet. Officers serve in specialties ranging from medical logistics and operations management to research and clinical practice.

At NMRTC Twentynine Palms, Medical Service Corps officers support a range of services critical to both patient care and operational success. The hospital plays a key role in preparing Marines and Sailors for combat and responding to any potential injuries sustained during live-fire training at the Marine Corps Air Ground Combat Center.

""We need to take care of the next patient through the door, not only take care of them safely, but take care of them and make sure that they're doing well,"" Case said. ""That's a lot, but you all signed up for it. Thank you for signing up for it. Thank you for choosing this profession.""

The visit underscored the continued relevance of the Medical Service Corps and the critical role it and the Defense Health Agency play in supporting medical readiness around the world.",https://d1ldvf68ux039x.cloudfront.net/thumbs/photos/2508/9233523/1000w_q95.jpg,N,0.0,2025-08-01 22:56:15.085134

The reaccreditation extends through 2028 and encompasses TAMC, the Desmond T. Doss Health Clinic, and Warrior Ohana Medical Home.

The Joint Commission's rigorous evaluation process assessed the medical center's adherence to national healthcare standards across critical areas including patient safety protocols, infection prevention and control, medication management systems, and clinical staff qualifications. As the nation's premier healthcare accreditation organization, The Joint Commission's seal represents the gold standard for healthcare quality and safety.

""This achievement reflects our organization's evolution from reactive compliance to proactive system transformation,"" said Lt. Col. Ernestina dela Pena-Guba, assistant deputy commander for quality services. ""The survey validated our strengths while providing a clear roadmap for continued excellence.""

The successful outcome builds on extensive preparation, including a 2024 Defense Health Agency Accreditation Assist Visit that helped identify improvement opportunities and strengthen operational processes. Survey teams with decades of combined healthcare accreditation experience specifically commended TAMC's systematic approach to addressing previous findings and integrating evidence-based practices into daily operations.

Key factors in the successful reaccreditation included:

• Implementation of 24/7 quality and safety protocols

• Comprehensive staff training and development programs

• Enhanced coordination between clinical and administrative teams

• Systematic closure of identified gaps in care processes

• Integration of best practices across all service lines

The accreditation ensures TAMC will continue delivering world-class healthcare to active-duty service members, military families, and veterans while maintaining medical readiness for Army, Navy, Air Force, Marine Corps and Space Force personnel throughout the Pacific region.

Survey teams consistently recognized the professionalism, expertise, and responsiveness demonstrated by frontline clinical staff, department leaders, and support teams across all facilities. The Quality and Safety team provided critical operational oversight, system analysis, and leadership support throughout the preparation and survey process.

""Every team member contributed to this success through their daily commitment to safer processes and exceptional patient care,"" dela Pena-Guba said. ""This reaccreditation validates our relentless pursuit of healthcare excellence and continuous improvement.""

The Joint Commission Gold Seal of Approval demonstrates TAMC's ongoing commitment to transparency, accountability, and the highest standards of patient care and safety.

“Our commitment to quality and safety backs up our promise to every service member, family member, retiree, and veteran that walks through our doors,” said Col. William Bimson, commander, TAMC. “Our hospital staff are the embodiment of the dual professional capability of providing exceptional medical services as healthcare professionals, while generating, training, and sustaining a highly effective joint medical force as a profession of the U.S. Army. Military medicine is deterrence, and if deterrence fails, we are there to sustain and protect the force, allowing them to fight and win when the nation calls.”

Today, TAMC is the only federal tertiary care hospital in the Pacific Basin. It supports 264,000 local active duty and retired military personnel, their families, and veteran beneficiaries. In addition, the referral population includes 171,000 military personnel, family members, veteran beneficiaries, residents of nine U.S. affiliated jurisdictions (American Samoa, Guam, and the former Trust Territories), and forward-deployed forces in more than 40 countries throughout the Pacific.",https://d1ldvf68ux039x.cloudfront.net/thumbs/photos/2508/9233592/1000w_q95.jpg,N,0.0,2025-08-01 19:56:07.173273

Christopher Backus, command surgeon, U.S. Transportation Command. ""Ultimate Caduceus will assess Transcom's ability and capacity to conduct global patient movement at scale and in a field training environment.""

“National Guard and Reserve members have different TRICARE coverage options when they transition between active and inactive status,” said Brian Smith, senior health system specialist, TRICARE Health Plan, at the Defense Health Agency. “TRICARE encourages you to review your health coverage options to ensure you maintain continuous health coverage. Do this prior to coming on active duty orders for more than 30 days and deactivating.”

What are my TRICARE options when I activate?

You get the same health care benefits as active duty service members when you’re activated for more than 30 days on qualifying orders. Your service updates your TRICARE eligibility in the Defense Enrollment Eligibility Reporting System. Your service does this each time your duty status changes.

Did you receive delayed effective-date, active duty orders for more than 30 days in support of a contingency operation or under 12304b? Then you get early TRICARE eligibility up to 180 days from the date your active duty begins. Do you want more information? Visit TRICARE Pre-Activation Benefits.

Here are things to consider:

Your TRICARE health plan. You’ll be automatically enrolled in TRICARE Prime as an active duty service member. You’ll have an unassigned primary care manager. This means you can see any TRICARE-authorized provider. You’ll follow your command’s guidance on any additional enrollment requirements when you arrive to your final duty station. The following TRICARE Prime health plans may be an option:

TRICARE Prime

TRICARE Prime Remote

TRICARE Prime Overseas

TRICARE Prime Remote Overseas

Your family gets coverage, too. Eligible family members may enroll in a TRICARE health plan. This depends on where they live at the time of your activation. They must act and enroll in one of these health plans within 90 days of your activation.

Dental coverage changes. Did you have TRICARE Dental Program coverage prior to activation? You’ll be automatically enrolled in the Active Duty Dental Program. This is described in the TRICARE Active Duty Dental Program Brochure. Your enrolled family members keep their TDP coverage with lower premiums. Family members who aren’t enrolled can join anytime.

Are you wondering how to get care while activated for more than 30 days? Do you have TRICARE Prime?

You can get routine, urgent, and emergency care from a military hospital or clinic or a civilian TRICARE-authorized provider.

Referrals and pre-authorizations are required for specialty care.

Do your family members have TRICARE Select coverage?

They can get care from any TRICARE-authorized provider.

They can get care at a military hospital or clinic if space is available.

They don’t need referrals in most situations. They may need pre-authorizations for some health care services.

Do you live and work more than 50 miles from a military hospital or clinic? Your family members may enroll in TRICARE Prime Remote. You can check to see if you’re in a remote location—use the TRICARE Plan Finder. Your family members get most of their care from a TRICARE-authorized provider with TRICARE Prime Remote.

What about line of duty care?

Line of duty care is limited to ailments incurred or aggravated during a period of qualified duty 30 days or less. This includes injuries sustained while traveling to and from and staying overnight at a duty station. Your unit is responsible for initiating an LOD determination request.

LOD isn’t a government lifetime health plan. It’s a special eligibility status to treat a specific condition for up to one year. The process for getting LOD care depends on where you’re located. Check out Line of Duty Care for Service Members to learn more.

How about when I deactivate?

Once your active duty period ends, your TRICARE coverage options depend on the type of orders you were under.

Were your active duty orders more than 30 days in support of a contingency operation or under 12304b? If so, you’d be eligible for Transitional Assistance Management Program coverage for 180 days. You and your eligible family members are covered as active duty family members. Your TRICARE health plan options depend on where you live with TAMP coverage. TRICARE Prime Remote isn’t available during TAMP. You must act and submit your new enrollment request within 90 days from your last date on active duty. If you fail to do so, you’ll only be eligible for coverage at a military hospital or clinic.

After TAMP coverage ends, or if you weren’t eligible for TAMP and your active duty period ends, you may have options. You may buy TRICARE Reserve Select coverage if you qualify. Or you may be eligible for Continued Health Care Benefit Program coverage. You may also seek health care insurance through your state’s Health Insurance Marketplace.

You maintain TRICARE pharmacy benefits during TAMP or other TRICARE health plan options.

Is there dental coverage after deactivation?

Active duty dental benefits continue during TAMP.

Your TDP coverage and premiums return to regular rates when TAMP or other TRICARE coverage ends.

Your family members’ TDP coverage continues without interruption.

Do I get retirement coverage?

You may keep TRICARE coverage after retirement. This is if you complete 20 qualifying years of service.

Are you retiring from the National Guard or Reserve? Are you under age 60? You may buy TRICARE Retired Reserve if you qualify. TRICARE Retired Reserve is a premium-based health plan. For more information, visit TRICARE Retired Reserve.

Have you turned age 60 and are drawing retirement pay? You may enroll in TRICARE Prime or TRICARE Select.

Are you under age 60 and drawing retirement pay due to active duty segments? You aren’t eligible to enroll in TRICARE Prime. You may buy or continue coverage under TRICARE Retired Reserve.

Want to make sure your family keeps their health coverage during these transitions? Review all your TRICARE options. You can contact your regional contractor with any questions.

Schena illustrates how, in certain circumstances, payments to marketing intermediaries for lab referrals can lead to criminal EKRA liability.
Key Takeaways Payment to marketers, or other intermediaries, that tracks to referral volumes can violate EKRA.
To interpret the meaning of “induce a referral” in the EKRA context, the Ninth Circuit turned to AKS jurisprudence.
The Schena court analyzed many of the same cases as the Seventh Circuit in United States v. Sorenson—a criminal AKS case covered in our May 2025 client alert.","In a matter of first impression, the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals interpreted the scope of the 2018 Eliminating Kickbacks in Recovery Act (EKRA) in the context of a lab operator who allegedly paid marketers to induce referrals for “medically dubious allergy tests.” United States v. Schena, No. 23-2989, slip op. at 4 (9th Cir. July 11, 2025). As relevant here, EKRA penalizes anyone who “knowingly and willfully . . . pays or offers any remuneration (including kickback, bribe, or rebate) directly or indirectly, overtly, in cash or in kind . . . to induce a referral of an individual to a recovery home, clinical treatment facility, or laboratory.” 18 U.S.C. § 220(a)(2)(A). EKRA is a relatively new statute, and the Schena opinion is the first time a federal appellate court has rendered an interpretation.

In our May 2025 client alert, we discussed two defense-friendly Anti-Kickback Statute (AKS) and False Claims Act (FCA) opinions, which narrowed the scope of advertising and marketing conduct that runs afoul of the AKS. While both the AKS and EKRA criminally punish paying remuneration for inducing referrals for certain medical services reimbursed by federal health care programs (e.g., Medicare, Medicaid, TriCare), a key difference is that EKRA is not limited to federal health care programs; EKRA’s prohibitions extend to referring patients for specific covered services reimbursed through private health insurance or self-pay. An EKRA conviction can carry up to 10 years’ imprisonment, up to a $200,000 fine, or both, for each occurrence. 18 U.S.C. § 220(a). Schena illustrates how, in certain circumstances, payments to marketing intermediaries for lab referrals can lead to criminal EKRA liability.

Key Takeaways

Payment to marketers, or other intermediaries, that tracks to referral volumes can violate EKRA. There is no requirement that payments be made to a physician or other healthcare provider who interfaces directly with patients.

A percentage-based compensation structure for marketers is not a per se EKRA violation. However, percentage-based payments made to marketers who are directed to mislead medical decisionmakers about the nature of and need for the covered service would violate EKRA.

Borrowing from criminal law and AKS precedent, to “induce a referral” under EKRA means “wrongful causation” or “undue influence”—e.g., where, in Schena, a marketer effectively takes over the clinical decision-making role of the referring physician, payment to the marketer constitutes “induc[ing] a referral.”

The defendant in Schena operated a lab focused on blood tests for allergies and, later, for COVID antibodies. He was convicted of one count of conspiracy to violate EKRA and two counts of substantive EKRA violations, among other healthcare and securities fraud offenses, and sentenced to eight years’ imprisonment and ordered to pay more than $24 million restitution for billing more than $77 million to public and private insurers for allegedly unnecessary tests (for which insurers paid only around $2.7 million because many claims were denied or paid at lower rates). The evidence presented to the jury at trial showed that (i) defendant directed marketers to misrepresent to physicians who did not have allergy testing expertise that these blood tests were more accurate than and superior to industry-standard allergy and COVID tests, with the goal of inducing referrals, and (ii) marketers were paid a percentage of the revenue they brought in. Before trial, the district court had denied defendant’s motion to dismiss the EKRA counts, rejecting the argument that his conduct did not violate EKRA as a matter of law where the payments were made only to marketing intermediaries, not to the doctors making lab referrals. See Schena, slip op. at 5-8.

On appeal, the Ninth Circuit considered (a) “whether EKRA applies to payments made to marketing intermediaries, as opposed to the referring doctors or persons who otherwise interact directly with patients”; and (b) if so, “what it means to ‘induce a referral’ in the context of that type of payment relationship.” Id. at 10. The court concluded that, “at a minimum, when percentage-based payments are made to marketing agents who are directed to mislead those making the referrals about the nature of and need for the covered medical services, those payments would violate EKRA.” Id. at 18. The court did not, however, elaborate on other scenarios that could violate EKRA, noting that the instant case represented a “sufficient” but “not a necessary set of circumstances for establishing undue influence.” Id. at 18-19.

To interpret the meaning of “induce a referral” in the EKRA context, the Ninth Circuit turned to AKS jurisprudence. The Schena court analyzed many of the same cases as the Seventh Circuit in United States v. Sorenson—a criminal AKS case covered in our May 2025 client alert. Compare Schena, slip op. at 16-18, with United States v. Sorenson, 134 F.4th 493, 500-02 (7th Cir. 2025). In overturning the lower court’s conviction, the Sorenson court identified a narrow circumstance (not present in that case) in which a non-physician could exert such influence over the medical decisionmaker as to render the physician’s signature merely a rubber stamp. In Schena, the Ninth Circuit—without citing Sorenson—determined that it was confronted with this type of narrow circumstance in which the marketing intermediary effectively took over the role of the referring physician, such that payments to the marketer induced the referrals.

Schena and Sorenson demonstrate that EKRA liability, like AKS liability, turns on the specific facts of each case. As EKRA caselaw develops, practitioners should expect courts to continue to look to AKS precedent for guidance. In the meantime, as Schena cautions, “companies and marketing agents seeking to steer clear of EKRA may consider whether it is preferable to structure their compensation arrangements in accordance with the statute’s safe harbor.” Schena, slip op. at 18 (citing safe harbor where “payment is not determined by or does not vary by—(A) the number of individuals referred . . .; (B) the number of tests or procedures performed; or (C) the amount billed to or received from . . . the health care benefit program,” 18 U.S.C. § 220(b)(2)).",https://jdsupra-static.s3.amazonaws.com/profile-images/og.16153_4556.jpg,N,0.0,2025-08-01 17:56:10.854605

That's why I keep coming back every year to speak at the GEMS program.” Johnson has a doctorate in cell biology and immunology from the University of Cincinnati College of Medicine.","FORT DETRICK, Md. – High school and college students participating as near-peer mentors in this year’s Gains in the Education of Mathematics and Science summer program had the opportunity to hear from two senior Defense Health Agency Research & Development-Medical Research and Development Command leaders about their scientific career journeys and to ask them about the benefits of pursuing careers in STEM. In addition to offering valuable career advice to budding young scientists, the engagement also supported DHA R&D-MRDC’s mission to cultivate the future workforce that will ensure DHA R&D-MRDC remains in the forefront of military medical research and innovation.

Dr. Carrie Quinn, Deputy to DHA R&D-MRDC’s Commanding General, and Col Jacob Johnson, a Fellow in the U.S. Army Medical Research Institute of Infectious Diseases Biosafety and Biosecurity Program, spoke about their career influences, educational background, military research, and leadership assignments to the GEMS near-peer mentors, who provide academic guidance to elementary school students participating in the annual extracurricular STEM education program. Quinn and Johnson were among a dozen subject matter experts from across the command who spoke to students and mentors throughout the five-week program.

In her discussion, Quinn emphasized that students could follow many paths to a career in science, citing her own eclectic journey as an example. After working as a physical therapist and emergency medical technician, she joined the U.S. Army so that she could pursue a position as a research scientist at the U.S. Army Research Institute of Environmental Medicine, part of DHA R&D-MRDC. There, she led a team conducting research into human performance in extreme environments. As director of USARIEM’s GEMS program, she was famous for greeting the students with high-fives every morning as they arrived at the front gate of the Natick Soldier Systems Center.

“There's no normal pathway. It's the pathway you want to follow,” said Quinn. “I followed almost none of the normal trajectory because I was willing to say yes to opportunities that sounded maybe a little bit weird. Every next job I've had has been better than what I expected it to be, and the number of doors that each opportunity has opened has been spectacular. So, don’t be afraid to say ‘yes.’”

In addition to conducting research in military medicine, Quinn has long been interested in its strategic policy aspects as well. Prior to joining DHA R&D-MRDC, she served in the Office of the Undersecretary of Defense for Research and Engineering as a senior advisor for critical and emerging technologies. She also worked for the Defense Intelligence Agency, where she served on special assignment to the White House Situation Room supporting the President, Vice President, and the National Security Advisor.

Quinn stressed that rapid advances in science and technology such as artificial intelligence in decision making, organoids for biological testing, and drones in combat will require tomorrow’s scientists to have a strong grounding in ethics.

“You are going to confront so many more ethical questions in your STEM careers than what I've ever had to deal with up to this point,” said Quinn. “Know your moral compass and do not stray from that. We have a saying in the Army: ‘the hard right and the easy wrong,’ If you choose to go with the easy wrong, you'll lose every time, and you’ll lose the faith and trust of your followers. And getting that back is almost a hundred percent not going to happen.”

Johnson emphasized that a STEM education can be parlayed into career opportunities beyond conducting research in an academic laboratory. STEM skills and knowledge are valuable assets for careers in fields as varied as publishing, technology transfer, program management, policy, and even financial services. Many of these non-laboratory activities play vital roles in DHA R&D-MRDC’s day-to-day operations.

“The career space today is completely different than it was decades ago, when I was in school, and it's constantly changing,” said Johnson. “The idea that you have to wear a white coat and work at a lab bench is only true if that’s the path you want to pursue. There are so many options out there, just waiting for you.”

To explore those opportunities, Johnson encouraged the near-peer mentors to actively seek out people in those fields who would be willing to share their experience and knowledge and introduce them to colleagues who can help them get a foot in the door.

“If I didn't have the folks who assisted me since the seventh grade, I don't know that I would be here right now,” said Johnson. “They inspired me when I was having tough moments, they believed in me when I doubted myself, and they encouraged me when I frustrated. That's why I keep coming back every year to speak at the GEMS program.”

Johnson has a doctorate in cell biology and immunology from the University of Cincinnati College of Medicine. After completing the Army Medical Department Officer’s Basic Course, the Army assigned him to DHA R&D-MRDC’s Walter Reed Army Institute of Research as a principal research investigator. Prior to his fellowship, he was director of the DOD Blast Injury Research Coordinating Office and the Joint Trauma Analysis & Prevention of Injury in Combat program office, located at DHA R&D-MRDC’s headquarters at Fort Detrick. As a biosafety and biosecurity program fellow, Johnson is gaining practical experience in how to conduct operations in high-security environments of the DOD’s most complex biosafety level 3 and 4 laboratories.

Johnson says workforce development is a vital prerequisite for DHA R&D-MRDC to be able to carry out its mission to improve Warfighter survivability and lethality, enhance force protection and readiness, drive medical modernization throughout the DHA enterprise, and contribute to deterrence and posture at the theater and global levels.

“I look at programs like GEMS as the lifeblood of our scientific bench,” said Johnson. “We are planting a seed with future scientists who could go on to impact government science, whether they end up wearing the uniform or serving as a civilian or contractor, or working with one of our partners in the larger community of interest. The near-peer mentors who participate in GEMS are getting a full-spectrum learning opportunity that will prepare them for their professional education and hopefully inspire them to become lifelong learners. Who knows what game-changing medicines or devices they could create?”",https://d1ldvf68ux039x.cloudfront.net/thumbs/photos/2508/9232865/1000w_q95.jpg,N,0.0,2025-08-01 15:56:07.097585

BY: ANDREW COLTON | Editor and Publisher | BOCA RATON, FL (BocaNewsNow.com) (Copyright © 2025 MetroDesk Media, LLC) — BocaNewsNow.com has confirmed that Cemhan Biricik, a homeowner in Boca Bridges, is the subject of the FBI raid conducted early Thursday morning in the gated West Boca Raton community. Biricik was taken into custody and is now facing more than 50 charges related to COVID-19 fraud stemming from an allegedly bogus COVID testing operation that he ran.

Agents conducted the raid at 9623 Macchiato Avenue which is the $4,725,000 home in Boca Bridges that Biricik owns with his wife. The United States Department of Justice immediately filed an order with the court in Palm Beach County asserting a claim on the property which does not appear to have a mortgage.

Here is the official statement issued to BocaNewsNow.com by the FBI Thursday afternoon:

>> Two individuals were charged for their involvement in a $500 million, nationwide scheme that involved billing Medicare, Medicaid, TRICARE, and other health insurance programs for COVID-19 testing services that were never rendered, United States Attorney Jerome F. Gorgon Jr. announced today.

Cemhan “Jimmy” Biricik (age 46) of Boca Raton Florida, and Dr. Martin Perlin (age 74) of Fairfield, Connecticut were charged with conspiracy to commit health care fraud and more than 50 substantive counts of health care fraud. Biricik was the sole member and Chief Executive Officer of Fast Lab Technologies, LLC (Fast Lab). Dr. Perlin was Fast Lab’s Medical Director and provider responsible for ordering the majority of the tests. Both defendants were arrested this morning.

According to the Indictment, during the Covid-19 pandemic, New York-based Fast Lab operated a website offering “free” covid tests. When individuals went to the website to order tests, they were asked to provide their insurance information. Fast Lab then used this insurance information to fraudulently bill Medicare, Medicaid, TRICARE and numerous private insurances for both antigen (“rapid”) and PCR (“laboratory) tests, across multiple dates for each beneficiary. Specifically, Fast Lab’s claims represented that (1) the antigen tests had been observed by medical professionals, (2) saliva samples were collected by medical professionals, and (3) PCR testing was performed on those samples. In reality, the vast majority of antigen tests—if taken at all—were taken at home and not observed by medical professionals; saliva samples were never collected nor returned to Fast Lab; and PCR testing was never performed. Dr. Perlin was the ordering physician for these tests, despite not having a treating relationship with the beneficiaries. Further, Fast Lab would regularly submit insurance claims before the test kits were even delivered to the beneficiaries. In total, Biricik billed or caused to be billed more than $500 million in claims and was paid more than $50 million.

Gorgon was joined in the announcement by Special Agent in Charge Mario Pinto, U.S. Department of Health and Human Services Office of Inspector General (HHS-OIG), Chicago Regional Office; Special Agent in Charge Cheyvoryea Gibson, Federal Bureau of Investigation, Detroit Division; Special Agent in Charge Derek M. Holt of the U.S. Office of Personnel Management Office of the Inspector General; Acting Assistant Secretary of Labor for the Employee Benefits Security Administration Janet Dhillon (DOL-EBSA); Detroit Division; Acting Special Agent in Charge Christopher Silvestro, Defense Criminal Investigative Service (DCIS); Special Agent in Charge Charles Miller, Detroit Field Office, Internal Revenue Service – Criminal Investigation (IRS-CI); Special Agent in Charge Megan Howell, Great Lakes Region, U.S. Department of Labor, Office of Inspector General (DOL-OIG); Acting Inspector in Charge Sean McStravick, U.S. Postal Inspection Service (USPIS); Owen Cypher, U.S. Marshal for the Eastern District of Michigan and Michigan Attorney General Dana Nessel, Medicaid Fraud Control Unit (MFCU).

The public is reminded that an Indictment is not evidence of guilt. The defendants are presumed innocent and entitled to a fair trial at which the government has the burden of proving guilt beyond a reasonable doubt.

This case is being investigated by Special Agents from HHS-OIG, FBI, OPM-OIG, DOL-EBSA, DCIS, MFCU, IRS-CI, DOL-OIG, USPIS, and the U.S. Marshal’s Service. It is being prosecuted by Assistant U.S. Attorneys Regina R. McCullough and Ryan A. Particka. Assistant United States Attorney Ryan T. Nees of the United States Attorney’s Office for the Southern District of New York also provided assistance. <<",https://i0.wp.com/bocanewsnow.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/IMG_4367.jpeg,N,0.0,2025-08-01 15:56:14.124758

• Zynex (ZYXI) crashes to $1.25, a 43.9% drop from $2.23

• Intraday range collapses to $1.24–$2.11, with 1.84M shares traded

• 52-week low of $1.24 nearly reached, dynamic PE at -0.62 signals distress

• Sector peers mixed as Zynex’s freefall defies broader healthcare equipment trends

Zynex’s stock has experienced a historic intraday selloff, trading near its 52-week low amid a lack of clear catalysts. With technical indicators confirming a bearish breakdown and sector-wide uncertainty, traders are left scrambling to decode the move. This collapse raises urgent questions about liquidity, earnings fallout, and leadership shifts.

Earnings Miss and Leadership Shake-Up Trigger Liquidity-Driven Selloff

ZYXI’s 43.9% intraday freefall stems from a confluence of technical breakdowns and absent positive catalysts. The stock opened at $2.11, immediately testing the 200-day moving average ($5.25), a critical resistance level. With the 52-week low ($1.24) in sight and Bollinger Bands tightening (lower band at $2.13), the price accelerated toward the lower band. The Q2 earnings report revealed a 55.3% revenue drop to $22.29M and a $0.66/share loss, while leadership changes and suspended guidance created uncertainty. MACD histogram (-0.0043) and RSI (49.5) signal oversold conditions, yet the move lacks a clear news trigger. The absence of company-specific updates and the sector’s muted response (-1.24% for Medtronic) suggests a liquidity-driven selloff, likely from short-covering or forced liquidation.

Healthcare Equipment Sector Afloat as Zynex Drowns

The Health Care Equipment sector remains mixed, with Medtronic (MDT) down 1.12% and no clear correlation to ZYXI’s collapse. While sector peers like Baxter and NeoGenomics report earnings and product launches, Zynex’s freefall appears isolated. The broader sector’s focus on regulatory updates and EU tariffs contrasts with ZYXI’s internal challenges, suggesting the selloff stems from company-specific factors rather than macro trends.

Navigating ZYXI’s Technical Abyss: ETFs and Strict Stop-Loss Discipline

• 200-day MA: $5.25 (far above current price)

• RSI: 49.5 (oversold but no immediate reversal)

• Bollinger Bands: $2.13 (lower) vs. $2.64 (upper)

• MACD: 0.016 (bullish) vs. signal line 0.020 (bearish)

Technical indicators paint a dire picture for ZYXI. The stock is entrenched in a long-term bearish trend (K-line pattern) and has breached critical support levels. With no options chain to leverage, traders must rely on ETFs or sector exposure. The lack of leveraged ETF data complicates directional bets, but short-term volatility suggests a focus on strict stop-loss discipline. Key levels to watch: $1.30 (52-week low) and $1.35 (next support). Aggressive short-sellers may consider a 5% downside scenario (ST = $1.235), but liquidity risks remain high.

Backtest Zynex Stock Performance

The ZYXI ETF has experienced a -44% intraday plunge, and the backtest results show a mixed performance in the following days. The 3-day win rate is 52.47%, the 10-day win rate is 52.83%, and the 30-day win rate is 48.99%.

Ryan said that KACH would be downgraded from a community hospital where patients can receive high-quality inpatient treatment into what is effectively an urgent care under a proposed plan by President Donald Trump that would downsize 17 military treatment facilities.

“As the first West Point graduate to represent the Academy in Congress, I have a solemn duty to ensure that the entire West Point community – the cadets, active service members, retirees, and their families – have access to high-quality health care. I’ve also experienced the exceptional care at Keller firsthand, so I know how devastating this closure would be,” said Congressman Pat Ryan. “We should be working together to improve medical care for our military community – not degrading it further.”

KACH provides a range of health care services for the cadets and military personnel stationed at West Point, including inpatient and surgical care.

Without the inpatient unit, in particular the orthopedic capabilities, cadets will have to travel at least 40 minutes to the next closest facility. In a letter to Smith, Ryan (D, NY-18) wrote, in part: “Proposing such a plan is a dereliction of your duty and a slap in the face to the countless cadets, soldiers, retirees, and family members of the West Point community who sacrifice so much for our country.

“I believe my accomplishments at the 2025 ATA World Championships demonstrate the best of two worlds: service to country and mastery of self.”","FORT DETRICK, Md. – Lethality and readiness are the driving forces behind innovation in military medicine at the Defense Health Agency Research & Development-Medical Research and Development Command. These principles not only guide the development of life-saving vaccines, pharmaceuticals, medical devices, and equipment but also serve as a standard of excellence for the individuals who serve at the command. Col. Robert Carter, DHA R&D-MRDC’s chief of staff, recently exemplified these principles by earning top honors at the 2025 American Taekwondo Association International World Championships.

Drs. Robert and Kirti Carter, along with their daughter, Rajshri, embody a family-focused commitment to ATA Martial Arts, earning their black belts together and achieving numerous state and district titles while navigating the challenges of frequent military relocations. Their journey, which began in 2017 at an ATA school in Orlando, Florida, exemplifies the ATA motto, “A family that kicks together, stays together,” highlighting how martial arts can unite families and inspire excellence across generations.

At the 2025 ATA International World Championships, held July 22-27 in Phoenix, Carter secured gold medals in both creative and Xtreme forms and silver medals in traditional sparring and Xtreme weapons. The annual event is one of the largest and most prestigious martial arts tournaments in the world, drawing more than 3,000 elite martial artists from over 25 countries.

Carter’s performance was a standout in this world-class competition. Grandmaster MK Lee, the presiding grandmaster of ATA Martial Arts, described Carter as “a warrior, someone who is willing to express true feeling in action.” Judges praised his precise, high-energy forms and strategic sparring, as well as his Xtreme forms and weapons routines, which combine acrobatic technique with martial application and performance flair.

“Winning isn’t just about crossing the finish line first — it’s about the years of grit, sacrifice, and relentless belief that got you there,” said Lt. Col. (Ret.) Noel Lynkew, 2024 World Champion.

“As a teammate, he’s sharp, steady, and always has your back, just like in the dojo. You couldn’t ask for a better partner in or out of the ring,” said Col. (Ret.) Marion Grant, 2024 World Champion.

“Col. Carter embodies the spirit of the ATA — discipline, perseverance, and excellence,” said Uriah Breunig, owner of Infinity Martial Arts of Washington, D.C., which Carter represented at the event. “He trains with precision, leads with humility, and competes with heart. His victories on the world stage reflect what’s possible when martial arts and leadership come together. He’s an inspiration to everyone in our school and far beyond,” said Master John Faett of Leesburg, Virginia.

In addition to his role as DHA R&D-MRDC’s chief of staff, Carter serves as the biochemistry and physiology consultant to the Army surgeon general. His previous assignments include White House social aide to the president, MRDC liaison officer, and medical modernization and research, development, and acquisition advisor to the executive deputy to the commanding general, Army Futures Command Headquarters in Austin, Texas.

Carter credits his achievement to his dedication to the shared ethos between martial arts and the armed forces — honor, perseverance, self-discipline, and leadership.

“The structure and values of military service complement the discipline of martial arts training,” Carter said. “I believe my accomplishments at the 2025 ATA World Championships demonstrate the best of two worlds: service to country and mastery of self.”",https://d1ldvf68ux039x.cloudfront.net/thumbs/photos/2507/9230460/1000w_q95.jpg,N,0.0,2025-08-01 13:56:12.445515

Dr. Martin Perlin, 74, of Fairfield, Conn., and Cemhan “Jimmy” Biricik, 46, of Boca Raton, Fla., were charged with conspiracy to commit health care fraud and over 50 counts of health care fraud, according to the U.S. Attorney for the Eastern District of Michigan.

Perlin was a medical director for New York-based Fast Lab Technologies, LLC., and was a provider responsible for ordering the majority of tests, the attorney's office said.

Biricik served as the sole member and CEO of Fast Lab.

Fast Lab ran a website during the COVID-19 pandemic that claimed to offer free COVID tests, the attorney's office said.

The website asked people to enter their insurance information as they attempted to order the tests. The attorney's office said Fast Lab would then use that information to fraudulently bill Medicare, Medicaid, TRICARE and other private insurances for antigen — ""rapid"" — and PCR — ""laboratory"" — tests.

The billing included multiple dates for each beneficiary.

Fast Lab allegedly made false claims about the tests, including that medical professionals observed the antigen tests, that medical professionals collected the saliva samples and that PCR testing was performed on the samples.

Citing the indictment, the attorney's office said the vast majority of antigen tests were taken at home and not observed by medical professionals. Medical professionals also neither collected nor returned saliva samples to Fast Lab, and PCR testing was not performed.

Perlin ordered the tests despite not having treated any of the people who would receive them. Fast Lab would also allegedly submit insurance claims before the test kits were delivered to the beneficiaries.

Biricik's billing scheme led to over $500 million in claims and was paid over $50 million, the attorney's office said.
