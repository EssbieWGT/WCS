Deputy Commissioner for Operations & Chief Operating Officer, Food and Drug Administration

Barclay Butler’s latest achievement is applying the lessons he learned while leading the consolidation of Army, Navy and Air Force hospitals into the Defense Health Agency to designing and launching FDA’s new shared services operating model.

“Our single vision in the COO’s office is to remove administrative burdens from the reviewers, inspectors, and investigators by providing them with effective and efficient shared services covering finance, human resources, facilities, IT, contracting, grants, FOIA, and more, by which we can improve on the time and cost of reviews and inspections, bring more products to the American public, while assuring we meet the FDA mission to protect the public health and preserve the national security,” Butler said.

Why Watch

Through 2025, Butler’s team will focus on building and training the shared service providers that support FDA centers, offices and programs. Their goal is to remove administrative burdens from the drug, biologics, medical device, tobacco and food review teams; ensure a safe food supply; keep inspectors and investigators in the field; and give FDA staff more time to carry out their mission of protecting public health and national security.

As one of the largest operational divisions within the Department of Health and Human Services, FDA is fully aligned with the efficient use of taxpayer-funded resources. It has exceeded the administration’s resourcing goals while continuing to fulfill its critical mission on behalf of the American public.

“We also have to modernize,” said Dr. Marty Makary, FDA commissioner. “On day one of me being on the job, I actively began an effort to organize to use AI for our scientific reviewers to make their jobs easier. Well, two weeks ago, we just announced our first AI-assisted review with the latest generation AI technology. One reviewer said that what normally took him two to three days, the AI did in six minutes. … The goal is to reduce the paperwork burden of reviewers, which is tremendous, so that we can deliver more cures and meaningful treatments to the American people faster.”

Fun Fact: Butler is an avid sailor who spends his vacations chartering bareboats along the U.S. East Coast and in the British Virgin Islands. He’s also a member of American Legion Riders, riding his Harley-Davidson in parades with three large flags mounted on the back and helping raise money for local charities.",https://washingtonexec.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Screenshot-2025-06-27-at-8.06.01 AM.png,N,0.0,2025-06-29 13:56:24.121607

I go to the VA a couple times a year for check ups to stay active in the system. I also use VA podiatry, as there are no podiatrists in my area that accept Tricare. I have also started using some Community Care referrals, such as a sleep study.

Since you have both available to you, you have options in the event that you aren't satisfied with the care you are receiving.

Ok, always, always leave as many options open as possible for your care. I worked at VHA for 30 years. I know what we do well and I know what we don't do so well. Nownthis is obviously different at each individual hospital. If a medication is not on the VA formulary, then use Tricare. You should always use VA for DME (durable medical equipment) because there is no cost to the veteran regardless of service connection or not.

We continue that work this year and have already returned $1.3 million in constituent savings for Nebraskans.

The federal government should do the same. Now that I’m in the Senate, my team and I are here to help Nebraskans navigate the bureaucracy.

We have offices in Scottsbluff, Kearney, Lincoln, Omaha, and Washington, D.C. We also host Mobile Office Hours across the state. We have already visited all 93 counties this year and we visited them all twice last year. Our team is specially trained in assisting constituents with concerns and complaints. We can also answer questions about services, eligibility, or benefits from federal agencies like the Veterans Affairs, Medicare, or the Internal Revenue Service. I’m proud of our work to cut red tape and deliver wins for Nebraskans.

In 2024, we helped nearly 800 Nebraskans access federal services. We also helped constituents save or recover nearly $5 million from the federal government. We continue that work this year and have already returned $1.3 million in constituent savings for Nebraskans.

Richard out in the Panhandle is one example. He’s a disabled veteran. His disability requires him to get significant help for everyday tasks, like going through his mail. Late last year, the VA notified Richard that he owed nearly $20,000. This was because his dependent status had not been updated since 2015. Richard was shocked by this, as he had never been informed an update was needed. That’s because his VA notices had been inadvertently thrown away without his awareness.

Richard contacted my office in Lincoln after trying for months to submit the needed paperwork. This disabled veteran had no way of repaying this debt that he accidentally incurred. My team got involved and helped establish a claim. The VA updated his dependent status which wiped away Richard’s debt, saving him nearly $20,000.

A couple from Dodge County contacted my office asking for help. They always file their taxes on paper. In 2023, the IRS made a big mistake and said they owed over $34,000. Not only did these Nebraskans not owe money, but they were due a refund of over $25,000. The IRS then refused to pay their 2022 refund because of the mix-up.

This couple tried to fix it themselves. They sent letters asking for help and got no response. They even met with the IRS in Omaha. When they came to my office for help, our casework team got to work immediately. We found the IRS’s mistakes and showed them they were wrong.

Soon after that, the Nebraskans finally got a refund check for over $22,000. That included almost $1,500 in interest—which still wasn’t the right amount. After more hard work, we helped them get another check. In the end, the Dodge County couple received the money they were owed. It took more than a year, but we never gave up.

Other times, oversight means ensuring Nebraska companies are not overlooked on federal directories. A healthcare provider in Eastern Nebraska reached out to my office. They are an in-network provider for TRICARE. TRICARE is the health care program that serves our military members, veterans, and their families. However, TRICARE’s website failed to list this provider as an acceptable option.

That simple omission caused serious confusion. Patients didn’t know they could get care from this provider. As a result, this provider faced an estimated $150,000 in lost revenue.

My team reached out to TriWest, a contractor who manages TRICARE’s network in our region. We pushed them to fix the website and ensure this provider was listed correctly. Thanks to our efforts, the problem was resolved. The VA website was updated.

Now, military families and veterans who are TRICARE beneficiaries can see this proud Nebraska company listed as a trusted, in-network provider. That’s not just a win for this provider. It’s a win for every Nebraskan who depends on clear information and quality care.

These are just three of many examples of how my team and I work every day to help Nebraskans navigate the federal bureaucracy. We’re continuing the fight to protect taxpayer dollars and ensure federal agencies serve the people. From streamlining government to cutting taxes on Social Security, tips, and military retirement benefits, I’ll keep working to make government work better. We’re going to continue delivering excellent customer service for our constituents. Nebraskans deserve nothing less.",https://media.ruralradio.co/nrr/uploads/sites/16/2024/06/Senator-Pete-Ricketts.jpg,N,0.0,2025-06-29 13:56:44.332989

I’m proud of our work to cut red tape and deliver wins for Nebraskans.
In 2024, we helped nearly 800 Nebraskans access federal services.
We continue that work this year and have already returned $1.3 million in constituent savings for Nebraskans.
These are just three of many examples of how my team and I work every day to help Nebraskans navigate the federal bureaucracy.","When I was Governor, we focused on providing great services to Nebraskans. The federal government should do the same. Now that I’m in the Senate, my team and I are here to help Nebraskans navigate the bureaucracy.

We have offices in Scottsbluff, Kearney, Lincoln, Omaha, and Washington, D.C. We also host Mobile Office Hours across the state. We have already visited all 93 counties this year and we visited them all twice last year. Our team is specially trained in assisting constituents with concerns and complaints. We can also answer questions about services, eligibility, or benefits from federal agencies like the Veterans Affairs, Medicare, or the Internal Revenue Service. I’m proud of our work to cut red tape and deliver wins for Nebraskans.

In 2024, we helped nearly 800 Nebraskans access federal services. We also helped constituents save or recover nearly $5 million from the federal government. We continue that work this year and have already returned $1.3 million in constituent savings for Nebraskans.

Richard out in the Panhandle is one example. He’s a disabled veteran. His disability requires him to get significant help for everyday tasks, like going through his mail. Late last year, the VA notified Richard that he owed nearly $20,000. This was because his dependent status had not been updated since 2015. Richard was shocked by this, as he had never been informed an update was needed. That’s because his VA notices had been inadvertently thrown away without his awareness.

Richard contacted my office in Lincoln after trying for months to submit the needed paperwork. This disabled veteran had no way of repaying this debt that he accidentally incurred. My team got involved and helped establish a claim. The VA updated his dependent status which wiped away Richard’s debt, saving him nearly $20,000.

A couple from Dodge County contacted my office asking for help. They always file their taxes on paper. In 2023, the IRS made a big mistake and said they owed over $34,000. Not only did these Nebraskans not owe money, but they were due a refund of over $25,000. The IRS then refused to pay their 2022 refund because of the mix-up.

This couple tried to fix it themselves. They sent letters asking for help and got no response. They even met with the IRS in Omaha. When they came to my office for help, our casework team got to work immediately. We found the IRS’s mistakes and showed them they were wrong.

Soon after that, the Nebraskans finally got a refund check for over $22,000. That included almost $1,500 in interest—which still wasn’t the right amount. After more hard work, we helped them get another check. In the end, the Dodge County couple received the money they were owed. It took more than a year, but we never gave up.

Other times, oversight means ensuring Nebraska companies are not overlooked on federal directories. A healthcare provider in Eastern Nebraska reached out to my office. They are an in-network provider for TRICARE. TRICARE is the health care program that serves our military members, veterans, and their families. However, TRICARE’s website failed to list this provider as an acceptable option.

That simple omission caused serious confusion. Patients didn’t know they could get care from this provider. As a result, this provider faced an estimated $150,000 in lost revenue.

My team reached out to TriWest, a contractor who manages TRICARE’s network in our region. We pushed them to fix the website and ensure this provider was listed correctly. Thanks to our efforts, the problem was resolved. The VA website was updated.

Now, military families and veterans who are TRICARE beneficiaries can see this proud Nebraska company listed as a trusted, in-network provider. That’s not just a win for this provider. It’s a win for every Nebraskan who depends on clear information and quality care.

These are just three of many examples of how my team and I work every day to help Nebraskans navigate the federal bureaucracy. We’re continuing the fight to protect taxpayer dollars and ensure federal agencies serve the people. From streamlining government to cutting taxes on Social Security, tips, and military retirement benefits, I’ll keep working to make government work better. We’re going to continue delivering excellent customer service for our constituents. Nebraskans deserve nothing less.",https://media.ruralradio.co/nrr/uploads/sites/16/2024/06/Senator-Pete-Ricketts.jpg,N,0.0,2025-06-28 22:56:38.772131

This form is part of the reporting requirements established by the Affordable Care Act (ACA). For TRICARE beneficiaries, this document confirms their enrollment in a plan that satisfies national health coverage standards.

Understanding Your TRICARE 1095-B

The purpose of Form 1095-B is to serve as proof that you maintained Minimum Essential Coverage (MEC), a standard set by the Affordable Care Act. While the ACA originally included a federal tax penalty for not having health insurance, this penalty was reduced to $0 starting with the 2019 tax year. You no longer face a federal penalty for lacking coverage, but the Department of Defense continues to send these forms to fulfill its legal obligation to report health coverage information to the IRS and to plan enrollees.

Your TRICARE 1095-B contains specific details about your coverage. Part I identifies the “Responsible Individual,” which is the plan subscriber or sponsor. Part III names the issuer of the coverage, which for TRICARE is the Department of Defense Manpower Data Center (DMDC). Part IV lists each covered individual by name and Social Security number and includes checkboxes to indicate for which months of the year they had MEC.

This form is for retirees, annuitants, former spouses, and others covered by TRICARE Select, TRICARE Retired Reserve, TRICARE Reserve Select, and TRICARE Young Adult. Active-duty members and their families, as well as those enrolled in TRICARE Prime, receive a Form 1095-C. If a service member retires or separates during the year, they may receive both a 1095-C for their active-duty period and a 1095-B for their months as a retiree.

Tax Filing with Form 1095-B

When filing your federal income taxes, you do not need to attach Form 1095-B to your return. The IRS receives this information directly from the DMDC. You should, however, keep the form with your personal tax records as proof of coverage.

The relevance of Form 1095-B is more pronounced at the state level. While the federal penalty no longer exists, a handful of states have enacted their own individual health coverage mandates. These states require residents to have qualifying health coverage or pay a penalty on their state tax return.

Residents of the following jurisdictions may need the information from their 1095-B to complete their state tax forms and demonstrate they met the coverage requirement:

California

District of Columbia

Massachusetts

New Jersey

Rhode Island

Vermont

The information on your TRICARE 1095-B, particularly the months of coverage detailed in Part IV, is what you would use to satisfy these obligations and avoid a potential state-level penalty.

How to Access Your Form 1095-B

The most direct way to get your Form 1095-B is through the milConnect online portal. After logging in with a DS Logon, Common Access Card (CAC), or DFAS myPay account, you can navigate to the “Correspondence/Documentation” section to view, print, or save a PDF copy of your form. Forms are available by January 31 for the preceding tax year.

If you are unable to access the form online, you can request a copy by phone. You may call the Defense Manpower Data Center (DMDC) Support Center to ask for a copy to be mailed to your address on record. Having your sponsor’s Social Security number available when you call can help expedite the request.

A third option is to request the form via postal mail. You can send a written request to the DMDC Support Office. The request should include the sponsor’s full name, Social Security number, date of birth, and the tax year for which you need the form. This method is the slowest, so it is best to submit the request well in advance of any tax filing deadlines.",https://accountinginsights.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/cropped-ai6icon.png,N,0.0,2025-06-28 18:56:24.436056

You don't say but I'm assuming you are medically retired for your cap to be $3000? If not then your Group A cap $4261. If you ARE medically retired, all other fees go by Select Group A costs. So you would have a $150 individual deductible and a $300 family deductible you would need to meet before costsharing begins. Costsharing is another word for copayments.

Lets look at what Select Retired Group A says under Maternity Inpatient: Network: $250 per day or up to 25% hospital charge (whichever is less); plus 20% separately billed services

Out-of-Network: $1,306 per day§ or up to 25% hospital charge (whichever is less); plus 25% separately billed services

So you would then figure if you went to an in- network or out-of-network hospital.

Unlock your health—and peace of mind—by understanding how TFL and Medicare work together, as described in the Medicare publication How Medicare Works With Other Insurance.","JUNE 28, 2025 – Are you approaching the age of 65? Unlock your health by signing up for Medicare as soon as you’re eligible. Medicare Part A and Part B are required to remain eligible for TRICARE, with limited exceptions. Knowing how and when to sign up for Medicare will help you avoid gaps in coverage and late enrollment penalties.

“Signing up for Medicare three or four months before your 65th birthday is important to ensure a seamless transition to TRICARE For Life,” said Anne Breslin, TFL program manager, TRICARE Health Plan, at the Defense Health Agency. “Medicare and TRICARE will then work together to help minimize your out-of-pocket expenses.”

Understanding eligibility

Most people become eligible for Medicare the first day of the month they turn 65. Those with a birthday on the first of a month become eligible the first of the month before they turn 65.

Some become eligible for Medicare before age 65 after receiving Social Security Disability Insurance for 24 months or when diagnosed with certain medical conditions.

TFL is available to military retirees and their family members who qualify for TRICARE, are entitled to Medicare Part A, and have Medicare Part B, regardless of age or place of residence. You can sign up on the Social Security Administration website or by calling SSA to schedule an appointment.

Learn more by reading the TRICARE and Medicare Under Age 65 Brochure.

If you (or your spouse) are still working and have employer-sponsored health coverage when you turn 65, Medicare allows you to delay enrollment in Medicare Part B. But if you do delay enrollment, you won’t have TRICARE coverage. Answer a few questions on the Medicare webpage to find out what’s right for you.

If one family member becomes eligible for Medicare and is now covered by TFL, other family members not yet eligible for Medicare can still use TRICARE Prime or TRICARE Select.

Avoid penalties

It’s important to sign up for Medicare Part A and Part B during your Initial Enrollment Period, which is seven months long. This is when you’re first eligible to sign up for Medicare Part A and Part B. It starts three or four months before you turn 65. Learn more about late enrollment penalties and how to avoid them.

To avoid coverage gaps, keep your information current in the Defense Enrollment Eligibility System. This ensures you receive timely updates and benefits information.

Sign up for Medicare no later than two months before the month you turn 65 to avoid a break in your TRICARE coverage. There are no enrollment forms or fees required for TFL —it begins automatically the first date Medicare Part A and Part B are effective.

To learn more, check out the TRICARE and Medicare Turning Age 65 Brochure.

What parts of Medicare do you need?

To be eligible for TFL, you must have both Medicare Part A and Part B.

Part A typically covers:

Inpatient hospital care

Skilled nursing facilities

Hospice

Some home health care

Most people get Part A premium-free if they, or their spouse, worked and paid Social Security taxes for at least 10 years.

Medicare Part B covers:

Outpatient care

Certain preventive services

Durable medical equipment

Part B has a monthly premium based on your income.

You don’t need to enroll in Medicare Advantage (Part C) or prescription drug coverage (Part D) to have TFL coverage. Read the TRICARE Newsroom article “Q&A: How Does TRICARE For Life Work With Medicare?” to learn more.

For dental and vision coverage, check to see if you qualify through the Federal Employees Dental and Vision Insurance Program.

Coverage overseas

Medicare only provides coverage in the U.S. and U.S. territories. If you live or travel overseas, TRICARE becomes your primary payer. That means you’ll pay TRICARE’s annual deductible and cost for care abroad. You must still have Medicare Part B to remain eligible for TFL, even though it doesn’t pay for care.

Here’s what else to keep in mind if you have TFL and live or travel overseas:

You may visit any TRICARE-authorized provider for care.

If you’re in the Philippines, you must see a Philippine Preferred Provider Network or certified providers.

Be prepared to pay for services up front. You’ll need to file a claim later.

You have up to three years to file claims for overseas care.

Which pays first: Medicare or TRICARE?

When both Medicare and TRICARE cover a health care service, Medicare pays first and TRICARE pays second. TRICARE may also cover services that Medicare doesn’t. That’s why it’s important to confirm you’re covered by Medicare, TRICARE, or both—to help avoid costs.

You’ll also need to use Medicare providers. Check out TRICARE’s covered services to learn more.

Coordination with other health insurance

Other health insurance, or OHI, is coverage in addition to Medicare and TFL. This might be offered by an employer, based on current employment or retirement for you or your spouse.

How Medicare coordinates with OHI depends on whether the OHI is based on current employment. In either case, TRICARE pays last.

Unlock your health—and peace of mind—by understanding how TFL and Medicare work together, as described in the Medicare publication How Medicare Works With Other Insurance. You can view or print the booklet or call 800-MEDICARE (800-633-4227) to find out if a copy can be mailed to you.

FORT CAVAZOS, Texas – *Note: This article was originally published Jan. 24. It was updated Feb. 24 to reflect the payment deadline extension to March 31.*

Beneficiaries who live in the West Region, now have until March 31 to set-up payment with the new West Region contractor, TriWest Healthcare Alliance.

Beneficiaries who pay for TRICARE coverage using a bank electronic funds transfer, credit card, or debit card, must securely give recurring payment information to TriWest prior to the new deadline, and those who don’t act by these dates will be disenrolled, retroactive to Jan. 1.

According to TRICARE, The Defense Health Agency has extended the payment deadline for those enrolled in a TRICARE premium-based plan (TRICARE Young Adult, TRICARE Reserve Select, and TRICARE Retired Reserve). You now have until Tuesday, Mar. 31 to provide your payment information to TriWest.

If you have TRICARE Prime or TRICARE Select, you also have until Tuesday, Mar. 31 to pay your fees.

The latest deadline extension comes as a number of beneficiaries and health care providers have reported difficulty with the TriWest online portal, including long wait times to reach TriWest’s call center.

According to the Defense Health Agency, it’s aware that TRICARE beneficiaries transitioning in the West are experiencing significant call wait times and that TriWest is bringing on additional staff to reduce wait time and ensure TRICARE beneficiaries have the support they need to get their questions answered, transfer payment information to maintain health care coverage.

DHA also says that it knows many beneficiaries have active referrals in the West Region that have not been authorized by TriWest and that all active referrals and pre-authorizations from the previous contractors (Health Net Federal Services or Humana) that were issued before Jan. 1, 2025, will be honored by TriWest and will be valid through their expiration or June 30, 2025, whichever comes first. The TRICARE Health Plan team is working directly with TriWest to actively process all existing referrals. You can check your referral status or get assistance by visiting the TriWest online or calling 888-874-9378.

How long will the peaches and cream bar cake be at Costco?","It’s hard to resist the plethora of samples available on a trip to Costco. After all, the samples are unlimited. There’s always something new to taste and, more often than not, I end up with some of them in my cart. On a recent trip, there was a suspiciously long line in the bakery section with shoppers eager for something sweet. As I inched closer, I saw slices of a brand new cake getting snatched up as soon as they were plated. The sample was the Costco peaches and cream bar cake, and I was lucky enough to snag a bite.

What is Costco’s peaches and cream bar cake?

Kristina Vanni for Taste of Home

The peaches and cream bar cake is 37 ounces of dessert bliss, with fluffy whipped cream and tart peach filling sandwiched between layers of vanilla sponge cake. I loved the delicate white chocolate curls on top as an extra flourish. For $18.99, this large dessert is a bargain for serving a crowd. The size and shape is consistent with Costco’s other bar cakes, like the springtime carrot bar cake or everyone’s favorite tuxedo mousse cake, which is a staple in the bakery case.

How did the Costco peaches and cream bar cake taste?

After the first bite of the sample, I knew this cake was coming home with me. I certainly hope it becomes an annual flavor offering, because I would line up to buy it again. The texture was delightfully light and airy, as a perfect sponge cake should be. Since it’s made with whipped cream rather than heavier buttercream frosting, this also contributed to it being more delicate. Several Reddit users had the same thought as me: Rather than being too sweet, this cake leaned more tart because of the peaches.

The cake would be perfect to serve at a summer baby or bridal shower. I think it would also be a big hit at a graduation party. The flavor profile makes it a great choice to serve after a heavier meal like a summertime backyard barbecue.

How long will the peaches and cream bar cake be at Costco?

Costco loves to be secretive about the comings and goings of its products, so there’s no real way of knowing how long this cake will remain on store shelves. However, at the rate they were being snatched up, I’d say this cake is selling fast. If you’re interested in getting one for yourself, time is of the essence!

You have to find a list of PCMs from the Tricare website and then call each office yourself until you find one that is willing to accept you as a new patient. Once you find a PCM willing to accept you, you have to go back to Tricare and update your PCM info.

We have offices in Scottsbluff, Kearney, Lincoln, Omaha, and Washington, D.C. We also host Mobile Office Hours across the state. We have already visited all 93 counties this year and we visited them all twice last year. Our team is specially trained in assisting constituents with concerns and complaints. We can also answer questions about services, eligibility, or benefits from federal agencies like the Veterans Affairs, Medicare, or the Internal Revenue Service. I’m proud of our work to cut red tape and deliver wins for Nebraskans.

In 2024, we helped nearly 800 Nebraskans access federal services. We also helped constituents save or recover nearly $5 million from the federal government. We continue that work this year and have already returned $1.3 million in constituent savings for Nebraskans.

Richard out in the Panhandle is one example. He’s a disabled veteran. His disability requires him to get significant help for everyday tasks, like going through his mail. Late last year, the VA notified Richard that he owed nearly $20,000. This was because his dependent status had not been updated since 2015. Richard was shocked by this, as he had never been informed an update was needed. That’s because his VA notices had been inadvertently thrown away without his awareness.

Richard contacted my office in Lincoln after trying for months to submit the needed paperwork. This disabled veteran had no way of repaying this debt that he accidentally incurred. My team got involved and helped establish a claim. The VA updated his dependent status which wiped away Richard’s debt, saving him nearly $20,000.

A couple from Dodge County contacted my office asking for help. They always file their taxes on paper. In 2023, the IRS made a big mistake and said they owed over $34,000. Not only did these Nebraskans not owe money, but they were due a refund of over $25,000. The IRS then refused to pay their 2022 refund because of the mix-up.

This couple tried to fix it themselves. They sent letters asking for help and got no response. They even met with the IRS in Omaha. When they came to my office for help, our casework team got to work immediately. We found the IRS’s mistakes and showed them they were wrong.

Soon after that, the Nebraskans finally got a refund check for over $22,000. That included almost $1,500 in interest—which still wasn’t the right amount. After more hard work, we helped them get another check. In the end, the Dodge County couple received the money they were owed. It took more than a year, but we never gave up.

Other times, oversight means ensuring Nebraska companies are not overlooked on federal directories. A healthcare provider in Eastern Nebraska reached out to my office. They are an in-network provider for TRICARE. TRICARE is the health care program that serves our military members, veterans, and their families. However, TRICARE’s website failed to list this provider as an acceptable option.

That simple omission caused serious confusion. Patients didn’t know they could get care from this provider. As a result, this provider faced an estimated $150,000 in lost revenue.

My team reached out to TriWest, a contractor who manages TRICARE’s network in our region. We pushed them to fix the website and ensure this provider was listed correctly. Thanks to our efforts, the problem was resolved. The VA website was updated.

Now, military families and veterans who are TRICARE beneficiaries can see this proud Nebraska company listed as a trusted, in-network provider. That’s not just a win for this provider. It’s a win for every Nebraskan who depends on clear information and quality care.

These are just three of many examples of how my team and I work every day to help Nebraskans navigate the federal bureaucracy. We’re continuing the fight to protect taxpayer dollars and ensure federal agencies serve the people. From streamlining government to cutting taxes on Social Security, tips, and military retirement benefits, I’ll keep working to make government work better. We’re going to continue delivering excellent customer service for our constituents. Nebraskans deserve nothing less.

Poor mental health can cause teens to withdraw socially, perform worse at school, or engage in risky or destructive behavior.5 In extreme cases, mental ill-health in teens may lead to self-harm or even suicide.6 So, it’s important that teen mental health isn’t taken lightly.

TRICARE’s mental health benefits for adolescents mean that they will cover most mental health services that are deemed medically necessary. However, it is important to connect your teen with the right type of mental health care.

Sometimes, a combination of medication (such as antidepressants) and therapy is needed; combining cognitive behavioral therapy with selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) antidepressants has been shown to boost recovery rates in depressed teens, for example.7

If you feel that you are better suited to online therapy, your regional contractor will have a list of approved providers that offer telemedicine services, such as Mission Prep. Telehealth allows you to access professional mental health support in the comfort of your own home.

When you sign up to TRICARE it’s worth taking time to familiarize yourself with your plan, how much it costs, and the benefits it gives you. For example, if you are required to pay some of the costs yourself – these are called “out-of-pocket” costs.

Out-of-Pocket Costs

Always check that your plan covers any mental health treatment or therapy that your teen needs to avoid any unexpected costs or bills to pay. For example, if you visit a non-network provider you may have to pay higher costs and you may have to handle your own claims.

In some instances, you may have to pay upfront costs and make a claim for reimbursement. It is important to ensure that you can afford to do so and that you are not placing yourself in unmanageable debt as this can cause additional stress and strain on your family. If possible, make some preparations for the interim time whilst you wait to receive your money back.

Maximizing Benefits

To keep your out-of-pocket costs as low as possible, make sure you know the rules about referrals and authorizations before making an appointment. It’s good to also familiarize yourself with their exclusions to understand what types of services are NOT covered to avoid any unexpected charges.

Furthermore, we recommend seeking out advice as to whether you are entitled to any other help or government benefits to use in conjunction with TRICARE that may help you or your family.

Advocating for CU Anschutz in Washington, D.C., 6-27-25

Dear CU Anschutz community,

Over the past several weeks, we have traveled to Washington, D.C., along with leadership from across the University of Colorado system, to meet with members of Colorado's congressional delegation on key issues critical to our campus and our mission. These visits are vital opportunities to advocate for our campus, our people and the work that defines CU Anschutz.

This week, we raised urgent concerns about delayed and disrupted federal research funding, including mission-critical NIH grants. We reinforced the concern over graduate and professional student borrowing limits that would create new barriers for aspiring health professionals, particularly those from rural communities and economically disadvantaged backgrounds. And, as the state’s largest physician provider, we emphasized the importance of federal programs such as Medicaid, Medicare and Tricare in providing coverage for all Coloradans.

We also shared the success stories that position CU Anschutz as a national leader in academic medicine ‒ from groundbreaking cancer care to pioneering research in traumatic brain injury and substance use disorders to our growing presence in Colorado Springs, Fort Collins and rural regions across the state. These stories help our lawmakers understand the real-world impact of policy decisions, and they highlight the extraordinary work being led by all of you.

As we continue these conversations with both state and federal leaders, our message remains clear: CU Anschutz is an essential and trusted partner in delivering the finest healthcare today and in building a healthier future for all. We will keep advocating for the resources, policies and support that empower your work and deepen our impact across Colorado and beyond.

We understand the concerns of our faculty, students and staff during these uncertain times, and we remain committed to advocating fiercely on your behalf and for the mission we all share. It's simply too important to do anything less.

Saraceni, a member of U.S. Navy Medicine Readiness and Training Command Guantanamo Bay, transformed geographic isolation into innovation, crafting a resilient, mission-ready nursing culture at U.S.
Naval Hospital Guantanamo Bay.
Rebeca Rodriguez, the hospital’s chief nursing officer, nominated Saraceni for the award.
Bond Henry, chief nursing officer for Defense Health Network (DHN) Atlantic, coordinated award nominations across the region.","In the second year of the Defense Health Agency’s Annual Nursing Awards, Cmdr. Crystal Saraceni was honored with the 2025 award for Healthy Work Environment, a recognition reserved for those who define excellence in military nursing.

The award included civilians and nurses from the Army, Navy, and Air Force, distinguishing Saraceni from more than 29,000 nurses within the Military Health System.

Saraceni, a member of U.S. Navy Medicine Readiness and Training Command Guantanamo Bay, transformed geographic isolation into innovation, crafting a resilient, mission-ready nursing culture at U.S. Naval Hospital Guantanamo Bay. Cmdr. Rebeca Rodriguez, the hospital’s chief nursing officer, nominated Saraceni for the award.

“We often focus so hard on ensuring deckplate Sailors are recognized for their accomplishments that we forget that leadership is at the deckplate as well,” Rodriguez said. “Seeing the hard work and determination that she puts into everything she does makes me so proud. I wanted everyone to be aware of her passion and incredible work ethic.”

The Healthy Work Environment Award recognizes Saraceni for her impact creating a better workplace environment and inspiring nurses and corpsmen to continuously improve and excel.

“Leadership is about establishing trust and building a solid team,” Saraceni said. “I will forever be grateful for the opportunity to participate in this journey.”

As Clinical Nurse Specialist, Director of Clinical Support Services, and Chief Nursing Informatics Officer, Saraceni tackled challenges related to the hospital’s low-patient volume. Recognizing the risk of skill atrophy, she introduced hands-on training to maintain clinical readiness, covering procedures like anticoagulant injections and nasogastric tube care. Her efforts enhanced clinical competencies and fostered a culture of continuous learning and patient safety.

“I was shocked to get news of being selected for this award; it is humbling to receive this recognition,” Saraceni said. “To me, it’s a matter of doing my job. I come to work, do my best and hope that the lessons we learn together establish a groundwork for success in my teammates’ future careers. In my position, a huge part of my responsibility is to train and support our nursing and corps staff.”

Chief Hospital Corpsman LeMichael Wright, senior enlisted leader for Clinical Support Services, was one of several sailors who provided feedback to support Saraceni’s nomination. Wright praised her leadership and commitment to professional development.

“Commander Saraceni is a dedicated and exceptional leader who balances mission success with the well-being of her team,” Wright said. “She consistently recognizes her staff's achievements and goes above and beyond to ensure the morale and functionality of her departments, even during critical manpower shortages. Her leadership was crucial during Operation Southern Guard, where she selflessly shifted roles to support the mission, prioritizing the needs of others over her own. Her commitment to her personnel and the mission exemplifies a leadership style that is truly unparalleled.”

Under her leadership, departments earned three of the last four Department of the Quarter awards. She also supported staff morale through activities like the Captain’s Cup, promoting camaraderie and self-care.

“She’s a strong advocate for all personnel on the island,” said Capt. Tammy Servies, hospital director and commanding officer of USNMRTC Guantanamo Bay. “Our unique location and patient population require constant advocacy, and I can always count on her to fight for our patients.

“This recognition is a long time coming,” Servies continued. “She is truly an expert in many fields and her push to cross-train our nurses in this remote location demonstrates her forward-leaning strategic thinking.”

Capt. Bond Henry, chief nursing officer for Defense Health Network (DHN) Atlantic, coordinated award nominations across the region.

“We selected one nomination from each category to move forward from our Network, fine-tuned the nominations, and submitted to be considered across the entire DHA,” said Henry. “Commander Saraceni was highlighted as a leader who has thrived in a small and isolated environment, which requires top performers to fill multiple roles at once. Her leadership style and proactive approach to problem solving created a healthy work environment for all the staff in Guantanamo Bay.”

The Defense Health Agency (DHA) manages military treatment facilities across the Department of Defense, integrating healthcare services to enhance readiness, improve patient outcomes, and streamline medical operations. As part of this system, USNH Guantanamo Bay plays a vital role as the only hospital delivering healthcare to service members and their families, federal employees, U.S. and foreign national contractors, stationed at Naval Station Guantanamo Bay. The hospital also operates the Department of Defense’s only overseas military home healthcare program, providing ongoing care to elderly special category residents who sought asylum on the installation during the Cuban Revolution.",https://d1ldvf68ux039x.cloudfront.net/thumbs/photos/2506/9136559/1000w_q95.jpg,N,1.0,2025-06-27 16:56:33.830162

If a non-career veteran is eligible for VA healthcare, couldn’t that be used in place of Medicare?
FYI, I have previously explained numerous times that veterans who rely on the VA for 100% of their healthcare can, indeed, disenroll from Medicare Part B (thus saving the monthly Part B premium).
That said, I fully understand that some veterans rely exclusively on the VA for their healthcare needs, and I have explained to many who have written to me that they have that option.
So, please rest assured that we regularly advise our veterans about their healthcare options under Medicare, including the ability to decline Medicare Part B coverage if they have full VA healthcare coverage.","DEAR RUSTY: In your answer to a retired U.S. Navy veteran about why he is forced to enroll in Medicare, you focused on military TriCare’s requirement for the member to enroll in Medicare. But you said nothing about regular VA healthcare. If a non-career veteran is eligible for VA healthcare, couldn’t that be used in place of Medicare? — Veteran Advocate

DEAR VETERAN ADVOCATE: Thank you for your feedback. FYI, I have previously explained numerous times that veterans who rely on the VA for 100% of their healthcare can, indeed, disenroll from Medicare Part B (thus saving the monthly Part B premium). I don’t personally recommend it because of my personal experience, but it certainly is possible to do so.

Personally, I use the VA for some of my healthcare needs — usually an annual checkup and optometry services — at my local VA clinic, which is only a mile away from where I live. But for any extensive treatment needs (medical tests, etc.) I must travel about 40 miles to the nearest VA hospital facility.

For contrast, I have numerous private healthcare services, specialists and hospitals very near where I live, but to use them under the VA I must get VA pre-approval and use only certain VA-approved providers, which is inconvenient for me.

Personally, I prefer the freedom to go to any healthcare service provider I choose, without restriction, at any time I need to. So, I use my VA coverage when it is convenient for me but rely also on non-VA, Medicare-approved specialists who I can choose to use (or not) at will. For me, it’s a matter of convenience and the freedom to use whichever healthcare provider I want.

That said, I fully understand that some veterans rely exclusively on the VA for their healthcare needs, and I have explained to many who have written to me that they have that option. I have also published several public articles about this as well.

So, please rest assured that we regularly advise our veterans about their healthcare options under Medicare, including the ability to decline Medicare Part B coverage if they have full VA healthcare coverage. FYI, free Medicare Part A (inpatient hospitalization coverage) is mandatory to collect Social Security after age 65, but Medicare Part B coverage is always optional because there is a premium associated with Part B. A veteran can decline Medicare Part B coverage and save that monthly premium, but they would need to contact Social Security to do so.

Social Security will want to interview the veteran to ensure they are aware of the potential financial consequences of not having Medicare Part B. And they may need to file form CMS-1763 (Request for Termination). But a non-career veteran can opt out of Medicare Part B if they get all of their healthcare services through the VA.

I know Tricare doesn’t play nicely with everyone.
I’d call around to both their billing department and Tricare (tricare first).
Always call the nurse advice line before seeking urgent care.
You may have seen an out of network urgent care and are subject to point of service fees.","If it's the first time you're using the coverage and you're on Select, you have a deductible to meet along with the cost-share.

Your explanation of benefits will explain how the claim was processed and how much you owe.

Select is probably the best coverage we get from Tricare. Once you understand to track your deductible and you learn who is in network(even using out of network, it wasn’t even expensive), it actually is the best coverage. I actually prefer it even when I used universal health insurance in Germany and Australia. Tricare select (when you learn how to use it) is hard to beat.

People just get scared about the idea of paying out of pocket that they rather just go with prime for mediocre care.

Some places like to balance bill, even though they’re not supposed to, and hope that the insured doesn’t know to question it. Could be another billing issue altogether. Maybe it’s Sentara. I know Tricare doesn’t play nicely with everyone. I went to get my kid a physical at a MultiCare urgent care (I’m in a healthcare desert; urgent care is basically our primary doc), and they said that Tricare wouldn’t contract with them to pay for sports physicals (but Tricare will pay for everything else), so it was $350 up front. They were also kind enough to recommend other urgent cares that did play nice with Tricare.

So if that’s the case here, for some reason, they should have told you up front. I’d call around to both their billing department and Tricare (tricare first). They should cover a lot more than $44.67 even if you haven’t reached your deductible.

Always call the nurse advice line before seeking urgent care. They will direct you to the correct echelon of care and to ask network provider.

DENVER, CO / ACCESS Newswire / June 26, 2025 / Hospitals and health systems are facing unprecedented strain from unresolved, complex accounts receivable (AR), particularly in segments involving legal, regulatory, or high-dollar clinical factors. According to Black Book Research's 2025 survey of 902 U.S. provider revenue cycle executives, over 42% of aging AR is now tied to complex claims that require advanced capabilities far beyond standard billing office functions.

""Provider organizations can no longer afford to let complex claims stall in their aging buckets,"" said Doug Brown, Founder of Black Book Research. ""Specialized AR segments demand precise recovery models, policy fluency, and advanced denial intelligence - whether the issue is payer resistance, clinical ambiguity, or legal complexity.""

Ten High-Impact Complex AR Categories in 2025

Workers' Compensation & Third-Party Liability These claims demand extensive legal coordination, state-specific rules adherence, and long-cycle tracking due to employer and insurer documentation requirements. Top Rated Vendor: EnableComp

Veterans Affairs (VA) & TRICARE Providers continue to report operational frustration with federal healthcare programs, including delayed authorizations, inconsistent reimbursement standards, and time-intensive appeals. Top Rated Vendor: EnableComp

Motor Vehicle Accident (MVA) and Personal Injury These claims frequently intersect with ongoing litigation, unclear payer responsibility, and documentation demands that require payer and legal team coordination. Top Rated Vendor: EnableComp

Clinical Denials & Medical Necessity Appeals Claims denied for inpatient status, medical necessity, or DRG assignment have the highest financial exposure. These require clinically credentialed teams and deep payer-specific appeal tactics. Top Rated Vendor: Knowtion Health

Legacy AR and Runoff Accounts Aging AR tied to facility acquisitions, EHR transitions, or defunct cost centers often stagnate unless recovered by firms with reconciliation and platform-agnostic retrieval skills. Top Rated Vendor: XTend Healthcare

High-Balance Self-Pay and Underinsured The rise of high-deductible health plans has pushed significant payment responsibility onto patients. Recovery depends on empathetic, data-driven financial engagement tools. Top Rated Vendor: Cedar

Medicaid and Indigent Care Retroactive eligibility, manual processing, and fragmented state regulations continue to challenge providers attempting to collect from public and indigent payer programs. Top Rated Vendor: XTend Healthcare

International and Cross-Border Claims Payers outside the U.S., including embassies and foreign insurers, add complexity through documentation differences, language barriers, and verification delays. Top Rated Vendor: Nymbl Systems

Out-of-Network and No Authorization Claims These denied claims often require extensive appeal documentation and are prone to long legal or negotiation cycles before partial payments are issued. Top Rated Vendor: Intersect Healthcare

Social Determinants and Care Setting Ambiguity New denial types are emerging around SDoH factors such as housing instability and unclear categorization of care environments (e.g., emergency vs. urgent care). Top Rated Vendor: Socially Determined

Black Book's 18 Universal KPIs for Complex AR Evaluation

Black Book's qualitative KPIs for evaluating complex AR vendors include specialized claim expertise, regulatory knowledge, recovery effectiveness, client responsiveness, and transparent reporting. Key factors also involve accurate payer identification, workflow flexibility, staff credentials, and quality appeal documentation. Additionally, proactive denial management, consistent recoveries, empathetic patient engagement, timely recovery actions, client-specific adaptability, ethical standards, negotiation effectiveness, and strong client retention rates are critical components.

""These indicators provide the foundation for selecting and retaining the right vendors to manage the revenue that too often gets written off,"" Brown added.

47 years old / 52 years old - from Portland

We have been a couple for 3 years and live in Portland.

Our sex life came to a standstill a little more than a year ago and we were aware that our relationship wouldn`'t last long if it continued like this. So we looked for solutions.

My penis was 10cm″ long and I ejaculated within a 3 minutes. I consulted a sexologist, went to the gym, took off the counter pills... even tried a pump I saw somewhere.. Nothinig helped.

Finally, a friend recommended I tried these pills he have been taken for a while. I researched the web and found amaing testimonials showing with impressive before and after photos. Men said they saved their relationship using TribalForce X. I always had a hard time believing in this kind of publicity, but this time we decided to try it, I didn't have much to lose.

It arrived 2 days later in a discreet package that my girlfriend didn't notice.

I followed the simple instructions, 2 pill in the morning every day and after 2 weeks I was surprised of my colossal new size and energy...

My Girlfriend also took noticed when I fucked her.. it turns out she wasn’t tired of sex... she just wanted a huge hard rock cock to worship and get off with.

Now, she can’t get enough of it.

She wakes me up with a blowjob almost every day, and begs me to fuck her!

So my results since I started taking TribalForce X, my penis is 6.6cm″ longer and also much thicker. Now I can last 1 hour straight without coming and I can finally satisfy my girlfriend. It's been only a month and a half since I started the cure but I still have the same size and stamina...

Be careful of fake copies of TribalForce X. Those can be dangerous.

I needed a referral from my PCM to go to the optometrist and get my initial referral to ophthalmology.
I’d rather jsut pay the $32 to go see ophthalmology on my own vs going through hoops to get a $0 visit I don’t pay anywhere near 50%.
I don’t pay anywhere near 20%.
You don’t need referrals for insurance, and any referrals you do get because of office preference don’t expire.","Select kicks ass. Prime is usually cheaper, but it has more hassle that goes with it.

That 50% you're thinking of isn't with Select, that's Prime POS benefits.

If you’re not on a base, get select. I was on prime and ran into some vision-threatening issues and getting referrals and authorizations from a a civilian PCM when you need urgent speciality care is added stress you don’t need. I needed a referral from my PCM to go to the optometrist and get my initial referral to ophthalmology. I’d rather jsut pay the $32 to go see ophthalmology on my own vs going through hoops to get a $0 visit

I don’t pay anywhere near 50%. I don’t pay anywhere near 20%. I’ve been on Select for 20 years. It’s the absolute best. There’s so much freedom with it. I think the most I pay as a copay is for my medication, which is brand name and costs thousands of dollars retail, and I pay around $119. But pre-2021, I paid like $15. So thanks for that, capitalism.

Imo, it’s so worth it. You don’t need referrals for insurance, and any referrals you do get because of office preference don’t expire. You can go to any doctor. Even if they’re not in network and bill Tricare, they’ll still get paid. I honestly think it’s the best in the country.

The only downside is that you can’t use it on a military installation outside of the pharmacy and emergency room. So if you want to see, say, a cardiologist, you can’t use one on the installation. You have to use civilian. That part sucks if you’re in a pinch or in a healthcare desert like I am, but in the long run it’s still better. And in your area, I’m sure most docs will take it.

Either way, good luck!",,N,-1.0,2025-06-26 21:56:32.161965
