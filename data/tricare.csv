Here are seven ways military life for spouses has improved across the generations.
Today, military spouses can video call from their bathroom while a deployed partner is halfway around the world.
Recognition: From Invisible to Indispensable Military spouses were once the “silent ranks,” expected to endure without acknowledgment.
Expanded child care options, commissary delivery services, and inclusive programs for families enrolled in EFMP have also improved daily military life.","For decades, military spouses held families together with handwritten letters, ration books, and slivers of hope. A paycheck might show up late, communication came in thin, blue aerogram envelopes, and recognition rarely extended beyond polite nods at a change of command ceremony.

These challenges have not disappeared, but the way military families meet them has changed. Today’s spouses carry the same grit, determination, and resilience, but they do so with advantages their predecessors could only dream of. Here are seven ways military life for spouses has improved across the generations.

1. Pay and Benefits: From Paper Checks to Predictable Deposits

Older generations of spouses knew the stress of wondering if payday would bring an envelope of cash or another round of IOUs to the landlord (the “poor house” was an actual thing). Today, direct deposit lands on schedule, predictable and steady, while housing allowances and cost-of-living adjustments stretch further than ration books ever could.

While no one pretends military pay will allow you and your friends to vacay in Tahoe, spouses can at least plan a grocery run without hoping the commissary will extend credit until payday.

2. Healthcare Access: To TRICARE and Beyond

There was a time when medical care meant whatever the base clinic could provide and little more. A sick child might have to wait days for a doctor, and specialized care could be out of reach entirely. Now, TRICARE opens doors to networks of providers, expanded mental health care, and even telehealth appointments from the comfort of your living room couch.

It isn’t flawless by any means, as milspouses still experience the frustration of long hold times and billing surprises, but the safety net is stronger and options are wider than what previous generations had to contend with.

3. Communication: From Waiting Weeks to Real-Time Connection

A letter from Vietnam or Korea could take weeks to arrive, often outdated by the time it was read. Families clung to every word like lifelines. Today, military spouses can video call from their bathroom while a deployed partner is halfway around the world. Kids can show off missing teeth over FaceTime, anniversaries can be celebrated with an emoji exchange, and social media groups keep spouses connected across continents.

Distance still has a sting, but anxiously waiting agonizing weeks is no longer the default.

4. Career and Education Opportunities: From Limited Options to Portable Paths

For decades, moving every few years meant starting over again. Careers would dissolve with each relocation, and educational dreams were often shelved.

Today, programs like MyCAA help spouses cover the cost of training, and online universities make degrees more portable. Remote work and interstate licensing agreements mean that more spouses can maintain professional identities, rather than being defined solely by their partner’s service. Progress is uneven, but the doors are more open than they have ever been.

5. Community Support: From Isolation to Infrastructure

Ask anyone who has served, and they will tell you that military life can feel lonely, even in crowded base housing. Support came only if you happened to live next to the right neighbor. Today, there are organized Family Readiness Groups, school liaisons, chaplains, and countless online networks that turn strangers into mentors overnight. A spouse searching for a pediatrician, a babysitter, or just a decent bagel can now find it with a few messages.

Isolation hasn’t magically evaporated, but the pathways out of it are clearer and stronger.

6. Recognition: From Invisible to Indispensable

Military spouses were once the “silent ranks,” expected to endure without acknowledgment. This was often accomplished with aplomb. That silence is slowly being broken. Annual appreciation days, awards that highlight their contributions, and advocacy groups that push for better policies have given spouses more visibility.

They may not yet receive the credit equal to the sacrifices they make (what else is new), but the cultural tide is shifting. What was once hidden labor is now being recognized as essential to readiness and morale, not to mention the mission.

7. Quality of Life: From Bare Bones to Built for Families

Military housing once meant drafty walls, unreliable plumbing, and waiting lists for repairs that stretched further than Black Friday lines. Today’s standards are higher, with accountability measures and renovations aimed at making homes safer and healthier. Expanded child care options, commissary delivery services, and inclusive programs for families enrolled in EFMP have also improved daily military life.

It isn’t perfect; every milspouse has a story of broken appliances or soul-crushing waitlists, but the baseline of comfort has climbed significantly.

We Salute You

The essence of a spouse’s military life has never been about ease for themselves; it has always been about their families first. It has always been about courage, adaptation, and finding strength wherever possible. Today’s spouses still carry that weight of uncertainty, but they do so with steadier paychecks, better healthcare, and stronger networks at their backs.

The generations before proved what was possible with little more than grit and handwritten letters. The generations now continue that mission, equipped with modern tools but the same unshakable resolve. The mission at home has never earned medals or promotions; it may never will, but it is the quiet force that keeps the rest of the mission moving. And for the first time in history, more people are beginning to see it, and to salute the ones who make it possible.",https://www.wearethemighty.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/military-life-operation-homecoming.jpg?quality=85,N,0.0,2025-10-04 21:56:44.821605

In a request for information posted on SAM.gov Wednesday, the agency said it is specifically interested in a system that integrates artificial intelligence into the workflow and provides low- or no-code development tools for building applications or powering automations.

Moreover, the proposed platform must secure Federal Risk and Authorization Management Program, or FedRAMP, High authorization.

VA also wants to hear about transition and migration strategies, integration with federal systems, customer service management, and compliance with the government security requirements.

Interested parties may submit their responses until Oct. 14 at 4 p.m. Eastern time.",https://www.executivegov.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/va-ai-it-service-management-platform-solicitation.jpg,N,0.0,2025-10-03 17:56:37.993919

In fact, following a survey of the damage to the impacted counties — including Barton, Comanche, Edwards, Ford, Hodgeman, Johnson, Logan, Marion, Morris, Ottawa, Pawnee, Rawlins, Saline, Stevens, Sumner, and Wyandotte — it is estimated that Kansas experienced roughly $7.6 million in damages, qualifying the state for over $5.6 million in federal assistance funding, according to their letter.

Sen. Moran and his colleagues “strongly” reiterated their support for the governor’s request, saying they look forward to federal assistance made readily available that will equip both state and local governments with needed resources to address the devastation caused by the severe storms.",,N,0.0,2025-10-03 17:56:42.862379

The National Treasury Employees Union said poor communication around agencies’ shutdown contingency plans caused “upheaval” for federal employees. And after the new threat of reductions in force, the American Federation of Government Employees is now suing the Trump administration, calling the White House’s directive illegal, and raising concerns that it will “inflict further pain” on government workers. Both federal unions are demanding an immediate end to the shutdown.

Some agencies’ messages about the shutdown are coming under fire. Public Citizen, a non-profit organization, has filed complaints with the Office of Special Counsel against nine agencies. The complaints come in response to those agencies posting official announcements on their websites that blame Democrats for the shutdown. Public Citizen’s complaints to the OSC allege that the nine agencies’ messages violate the Hatch Act.

Lawmakers are pushing to make health care changes more transparent for military families. A bipartisan group of lawmakers has introduced the TRICARE Transition Transparency Act that would require the Defense Department to notify TRICARE beneficiaries one year before a coverage change takes effect. Notifications would be sent electronically and communicated on social media and TRICARE’s official website. Rep. Jen Kiggans (R-Va.), the sponsor of the bill, said this legislation ensures that TRICARE beneficiaries “get repeated, clear reminders, well in advance, so they can plan, budget, and make informed decisions.”

Furloughed staff at the Education Department say out-of-office messages for their government email accounts have been automatically updated. The new message blames the government shutdown on Senate Democrats who didn’t vote for a stopgap spending bill. An agency employee said they noticed the new message, but didn’t make the change themselves. It’s the latest example of the Trump administration blaming Democrats for the government shutdown using official government channels. The Hatch Act prevents federal employees from acting in their official capacity to make political statements.

Carryover funds are keeping some agency operations going, but not indefinitely. With no deal in sight to end the shutdown, it’s not clear how long these alternative funding sources will last, and whether agencies will eventually need to furlough more of their staff. The IRS plans to stay open at least until Oct. 7, but it’s not clear what will happen if the shutdown extends past that date. An IRS employee said officials at one campus expect taxpayer services employees to keep working indefinitely throughout the shutdown. That means about one-third of IRS employees would keep working.

Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth has ordered the military services to overhaul the inspector general complaint process. In a new memo, Hegseth directed the secretaries of the Navy, Army and Air Force to work with the Defense Department’s Office of Inspector General to overhaul the complaint intake process, shorten investigation timelines, establish procedures to manage what he calls “repeat complainants” and use AI to “classify and route complaints"" and ""enforce deadlines.” “We are overhauling an inspector general process, the IG that has been weaponized, putting complainers, ideologues and poor performers in the driver’s seat,” Hegseth said. Legal experts said the new timelines are a way “not to have any meaningful oversight by the DoD IG.”

The new fiscal year brought significant increases in several federal procurement thresholds. Under the inflation adjustment statute, the FAR Council is increasing the Simplified Acquisition Threshold to $350,000 from $250,000. The council estimates that this increase will give more than 3,500 companies an opportunity to win contracts below or at the SAT. The set-aside limit for 8(a) and HUBZone sole source non-manufacturing contracts increases by $1.5 million to $8.5 million. The FAR Council is required by law to adjust these acquisition thresholds every five years based on Consumer Price Index data.

The Small Business Innovation Research and Small Business Technology Transfer programs have expired. After more than 40 years, Congress failed to reauthorize the programs before Oct.1. The House passed a one-year authorization on Sept. 15, but the Senate never acted on the bill. Both houses of Congress have worked on bills to extend the SBIR and STTR programs, but couldn't come to an agreement before the end of the fiscal year.

BOSTON, MA, UNITED STATES, October 3, 2025 /EINPresswire.com/ -- The National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine (NASEM) has released its long-awaited. The findings endorse applied behavior analysis (ABA) as a medically necessary autism treatment. It recommends that the Department of Defense make ABA a TRICARE basic benefit.

TRICARE’s Autism Care Demonstration (ACD) is a provisional program that authorizes ABA services on a temporary, experimental basis, rather than as a permanent medical benefit.

The report includes five critical recommendations:

• Discontinue the ACD and continue ABA as a basic TRICARE benefit.

• Eliminate mandatory assessments that don’t support individualized treatment planning.

• Reduce administrative barriers that limit access to ABA services.

• Align TRICARE’s ABA coverage with current best clinical practices.

• Establish an independent advisory council to guide the transition and ensure stakeholder input.

“This is an excellent report,” said Lorri Unumb, CEO of the Council of Autism Service Providers (CASP), the leading trade association for organizations providing autism services. “It reflects NASEM’s thoughtful interrogation of research and testimony from the autism community, confirming what we’ve long known: military families affected by autism need and deserve high-quality ABA.”

NASEM heard testimony from a wide range of researchers, practitioners, and others, including:

• Somer Bishop, University of California, San Francisco.

• Kristi Cabiao, Mission Alpha Advocacy.

• Karen Driscoll, child advocate.

• Erick Dubuque, Autism Commission on Quality.

• Thomas W. Frazier, John Carroll University.

• Gina Green, consultant.

• Michelle A. Linn, Alpine Autism Center (CASP member)

• Molli Luke, Behavior Analyst Certification Board.

• Hannah Rue, LEARN Behavioral (CASP member)

• Britt Sims, Integrated Behavior Solutions (CASP member)

• Jocelyn Thompson, LEARN Behavioral (CASP member)

• Dan Unumb, Autism Legal Resource Center.

• Chanti Fritzsching Waters, ABS Kids (CASP member)

• Rebecca Womack, RAW Consulting Solutions

“The Department of Defense has everything it needs to make ABA a permanent benefit for military families, thanks to the hard work of NASEM and the autism community,” said Unumb. “Implementing NASEM’s recommendations is the right thing for families and will strengthen America’s military readiness.”

After all, just as toddlers and teenagers might need a trip to urgent care or the ER at the most inconvenient times — during a PCS or when the military parent is TDY — pets have a way of needing attention when least expected.

While TRICARE doesn’t extend to furry friends, there is a plethora of pet insurance options, many created with military families in mind.

“Military life brings a lot of uncertainty, and pets are an important part of a family’s emotional support system during challenging times,” said Chris Hagesfeld, senior director of operations at Embrace Pet Insurance. “While navigating the complexities of constant change, pet insurance offers stability and the assurance that pet care is always a priority.”

Pet insurance usually offers coverage for things like illnesses, injuries, dental issues, hospitalizations, surgeries and prescription drugs, among other services. Americans spent more than $150 billion on their pets in 2024 alone, according to the American Pet Products Association. At the same time, approximately $4.7 billion went toward pet insurance.

Military families are often among this group — Hagesfeld said that around 25% of Embrace’s policy holders are either active duty or retired military families.

“We value and honor those who serve our country, which is why we’re proud to provide a military discount to our active-duty and veteran policyholders,” he said. “It’s our way of showing gratitude and doing a small part to recognize the sacrifices made by military families and their pets.”

These policies vary in price depending on several factors, including state, animal type, breed, age and more. A “middle of the road” policy for a healthy seven-year-old labrador in Arizona with a military owner, for instance, runs about $65 a month. A young cat, meanwhile, could be as low as $20 per month. Depending on the company and specific policy, owners still might have to pay for things like microchipping, obedience training, pre-existing conditions, DNA testing, breeding fees and cosmetic procedures like tail docking.

If you’re PCSing to an assignment in the United States, your pet is still covered. But make sure to update your new address with your insurance company as soon as possible, as your residency affects not only your rate, but potentially what veterinarian you can see, depending on the company.

Though Embrace (which allows use of any veterinarian) doesn’t cover OCONUS assignments, it does offer exceptions for deployments and short-term vacations. So check with your insurance company to make sure they offer coverage at your new assignment.

Military-connected memberships (like with Navy Mutual, USAA or the Military Benefit Association) often come with pet insurance or wellness plan discounts, so be sure to ask.

Navy Mutual, for example, offers the Wagmo Pet Wellness Plans, which reimburse for essential preventative services like vaccinations, grooming, dental care and check-ups. And don’t forget about extra benefits that may be “purrfect” for your military pet, like Embrace’s Wellness Rewards program that takes care of wellness visits, vaccinations and other preventative treatments. Other policies may offer extras like behavioral therapy for anxious pets.

Most importantly, your fur baby — and your wallet — will be taken care of in case of an emergency.

“The stressors of military life aren’t limited to people,” Hagesfeld said. “They impact pets, too.”",https://militaryfamilies.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/IMG_4746.jpeg,N,0.0,2025-10-03 07:56:30.655669

Once again, U.S. Rep. Jen Kiggans disappoints me. I’m an Army retiree and Medicare recipient. A few days ago, I wrote to Kiggans asking her to act to restore pharmaceutical benefits that the Defense Health Agency now denies to military retirees over the age of 65.

On Aug. 31, the DHA began denying coverage of certain medications to a single group of Tricare enrollees based solely on their age. Younger retirees continue to enjoy coverage for the exact same prescriptions. This action is discriminatory and illegal, a violation of the law.

I received a prompt boiler-plate response promising me that she’ll keep my “thoughts in mind should any legislation come to the House Floor that aim[s] to reform or improve Tricare.”

Kiggans is content to sit back and let the DHA continue its unfair and illegal treatment of her constituents. It must be too much trouble, or too risky, for her to step up for old military retirees.

Winsome Earle-Sears

There is too much money, particularly out of state, poured into political campaigns. It serves no good purpose as most of it is, at best, deceptive in its attacks against the opposing candidates.

Gubernatorial candidates former U.S. Rep. Abigail Spanberger and Lt. Gov. Winsome Earle-Sears each represent the policies of their party. Before a vote is cast, determine the issues most important to you and our state.

I want Virginia’s next governor to continue the conservative policies of Gov. Glenn Youngkin. Therefore, my vote will be for Earle-Sears.

Red herring

Re “Vote Republican” (Your Views, Sept. 28): The writer deflects our attention using the popular MAGA scare of the rare child upset by the presence of a trans classmate in bathrooms, sports or locker rooms. A red herring if there ever was one.

Voting Republican is what’s brought us higher tariffs (aka sales taxes); attacks on TV comedians; prosecution of political enemies; troops sent into our cities on false pretenses; our health system turned into a clown show run by anti-vaccine boneheads; valuable federal employees fired on the flimsiest of pretenses; people disappeared off the streets by roving gangs of masked thugs; peaceful protestors abused or injured; millions losing health care to fund tax breaks for billionaires; White House and Pentagon reporters muzzled; clemency for nearly 1,600 Jan. 6, 2021, rioters (more than 600 of whom were guilty of assaulting or obstructing law enforcement officers); and our great country embarrassed on the international stage.

Pick more important issues, sir.

Costs of kids

I am writing concerning the economic challenges of raising children in the Virginia’s 1st Congressional District. I am a grandfather who is frustrated by the Republican Party’s lack of empathy regarding the costs associated with child-rearing.

U.S. Rep. Rob Wittman’s continued support for the “One Big Beautiful Bill Act,” which he claims makes raising a child more affordable through increased tax credits, is a disservice to his district. These credits do not benefit many of Virginias’ most at-risk families due to their annual gross income.

The cost of an essential item such as infant car seats is often out of reach for hardworking Americans. For example, Consumer Reports recommended infant car seats cost around $250, requiring 39 hours of work at the federal minimum wage of $7.25 per hour, or 23 hours at Virginia’s state minimum wage of $12.41 per hour. When contrasted with the significant wealth increase of the richest 400 people in America, who saw their personal wealth grow by $1.2 trillion since the start of the year, it becomes obvious who Wittman views as his constituency.

Wittman’s reliance on repetitive talking points calls for a public forum in the Tidewater area where Wittman can explain how the bill he supports addresses the economic challenges of raising a child.

Susan Collins (R-ME) and U.S. Reps. David Valadao (R-CA) and Brian Fitzpatrick (R-PA) would permit early childhood educators to claim the same federal tax deduction currently available to K-12 teachers.
“As the author of the original tax credit for K-12 teachers, I am delighted to join this effort to expand this benefit to pre-K educators,” Sen. Collins said on Sept. 30.
“This tax credit would help more people by reimbursing early childhood educators for the resources they invest in our children’s future.” Research shows that educators spend an average of $860 annually on supplies for their students.
Yet, under current law, early childhood educators cannot deduct those out-of-pocket expenses, according to a bill summary provided by Sen. Collins’ staff.
“For early childhood teachers, every crayon, book, and learning tool is more than a supply — it’s an investment in a child’s future,” Rep. Fitzpatrick said.","A bipartisan, bicameral bill recently cosponsored by U.S. Sen. Susan Collins (R-ME) and U.S. Reps. David Valadao (R-CA) and Brian Fitzpatrick (R-PA) would permit early childhood educators to claim the same federal tax deduction currently available to K-12 teachers.

The Supporting Early-Childhood Educators’ Deductions (SEED) Act of 2025, S. 2791/H.R. 5334, which both U.S. Sen. Michael Bennet (D-CO) and U.S. Rep. Jimmy Panetta (D-CA) sponsored on Sept. 11, would amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to allow early childhood educators to take the educator expense deduction.

“As the author of the original tax credit for K-12 teachers, I am delighted to join this effort to expand this benefit to pre-K educators,” Sen. Collins said on Sept. 30. “This tax credit would help more people by reimbursing early childhood educators for the resources they invest in our children’s future.”

Research shows that educators spend an average of $860 annually on supplies for their students. Yet, under current law, early childhood educators cannot deduct those out-of-pocket expenses, according to a bill summary provided by Sen. Collins’ staff.

If enacted, the SEED Act would expand the above-the-line $300 educator expense deduction established for K-12 teachers in 2002 to also include pre-K and early childhood educators and help offset the money teachers personally spend each year on classroom supplies, books, and learning materials, the summary says.

“No teacher should have to choose between paying out of pocket or providing basic classroom needs, and this bipartisan bill expands the deduction so early childhood educators can focus on teaching the next generation rather than worrying about costs,” said Rep. Valadao.

The bill has garnered support from the Center for American Progress, the American Federation of Teachers, Teach For America, the First Five Years Fund, and Trying Together.

“For early childhood teachers, every crayon, book, and learning tool is more than a supply — it’s an investment in a child’s future,” Rep. Fitzpatrick said. “The SEED Act affirms their dedication by extending to pre-K educators the same classroom deduction K–12 teachers already receive, correcting an unfair exclusion, strengthening the workforce, and putting more resources into our children’s hands during their most critical years.”",,N,0.0,2025-10-02 18:56:36.670243

“Prosecution for murder should not have an expiration date,” Sen. Rounds said on Sept. 30 about Kamisha’s Law, S. 2624, which he introduced in July.

The bill is named for Kamisha, a 23-month-old toddler murdered in 1992 in Roberts County, S.D., in a case that went unsolved for more than 30 years until new witness testimony in 2023 led to the prosecution of Jay Adams, Jr.

“In the case of Jay Adams Jr., new evidence was not brought forward until over three decades after Kamisha was murdered,” said Sen. Rounds. “While he was prosecuted under a plea deal, this legislation rights a wrong by eliminating the statute of limitations for second degree murder on federal lands.

“I appreciate Kamisha’s mother Christine and her husband Roger for working with us on this legislation, and I look forward to working with my Senate colleagues to honor Kamisha’s memory and get it across the finish line,” he added.

The bill also would include second-degree murder, as well as murder of federal officials, according to a bill summary provided by Sen. Rounds’ staff.

Congress has previously recognized the seriousness of such crimes, abolishing statutes of limitations for first-degree murder, as well as child sexual abuse and abduction offenses in 2003 and 2006, the summary says.

Department of Veterans Affairs facilities will remain open as usual and provide all normal services.
PenFed Credit Union offers its affected members zero-interest loans covering a paycheck.
Andrews Federal Credit Union has short-term loans, penalty-free early withdrawals from Share Certificates and counseling available to its affected members.
Military exchanges will remain open.","The U.S. government officially shut down Wednesday morning, and until a funding deal is reached in Congress, troops will be working without paychecks.

Many federal websites and social media accounts will also not be updated in the meantime.

As the shutdown has stretched into a second day, here are some common questions and answers.

Who is getting paid, and when? And is anyone getting fired?

Service members will work without pay until a funding deal is arranged. Once the shutdown has ended, backpay will be issued for the missed payments.

Nearly half of civilians working for the Department of Defense — 334,904 — will be furloughed, the Pentagon said, though some may continue working without pay or maintain their duties with pay as usual depending on their agencies.

President Donald Trump is meeting with budget director Russ Vought Thursday to discuss “temporary or permanent” cuts in spending that could see mass layoffs of federal workers who are furloughed.

White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt said this week that layoffs were “imminent.”

Will my health services be affected?

Military hospitals and clinics will remain open, but the Defense Health Agency’s website will not be updated during the shutdown. As a result, you should contact your local hospital to check if its hours of operations or normal services are altered.

Tricare services are largely unaffected. The service’s website has a table outlining which services and administrative functions are affected, but emergency services, urgent care, surgeries, outpatient care, claims and online services remain unchanged for now.

Department of Veterans Affairs facilities will remain open as usual and provide all normal services. VA benefits, burials and suicide prevention programs will continue normally. However, call centers for the GI Bill, public outreach and career counseling will cease.

The VA’s website has a full outline of which services are and are not impacted by the shutdown.

If you need financial assistance

Furloughed workers can apply for unemployment benefits, but upon receiving back pay, they will be required to pay back any unemployment assistance they received.

Alternatively, service members and their families can seek help from their financial institutions, military aid societies and the Red Cross.

The Air Force Aid Society is not currently accepting applications for assistance directly related to the shutdown as Oct. 1 paychecks were still issued, according to a notice posted on its website. But if the shutdown continues to the point that Oct. 15 paychecks are disrupted, AFAS will issue new guidance. Its normal application process continues as normal.

The Navy-Marine Corps Relief Society does not have a special program for those affected by the shutdown, but its offices will be open during normal hours to assist those affected.

Army Emergency Relief says it will provide zero-interest loans in the event the Oct. 15 paycheck is disrupted, equivalent to the amount of one net paycheck up to a maximum of $6,000.

Coast Guard Mutual Assistance is offering an interest-free loan that covers up to one month of Basic Allowance for Housing.

The Air Force, Navy-Marine Corps and Army aid societies encourage households to try seeking assistance first from their financial institutions.

Some financial institutions are offering assistance programs:

Navy Federal Credit Union will allow eligible members to enroll in its Paycheck Assistance Program.

USAA is offering no-interest loans and special insurance payment arrangements.

First Command offers qualifying customers interest-free pay advance loans and penalty-free early CD withdrawals.

PenFed Credit Union offers its affected members zero-interest loans covering a paycheck.

Andrews Federal Credit Union has short-term loans, penalty-free early withdrawals from Share Certificates and counseling available to its affected members.

Major commercial banks are not currently offering financial relief programs. But if the shutdown lasts a long time, it may be worth checking again — during the last shutdown, Wells Fargo, Bank of America, Chase and Citi offered some assistance.

Other functions: DODEA, childcare, permanent change of station moves and more

Schools operated by the Department of Defense Education Activity (DODEA) would remain open, but sports and extracurricular activities were paused starting Wednesday, according to a note that was emailed to parents from DODEA school leaders on Friday.

Child Development Centers, School Age Care programs and Youth Programs will remain “at a minimum, operational for mission essential purposes,” according to Military OneSource, but local installations should be contacted for specifics.

Permanent change of station moves will be impacted. Moves to an excepted activity will continue, according to the Pentagon, but moves from an excepted activity will only continue if it is determined to be mission-essential. Moves associated with recruitment and training will continue.

Military exchanges will remain open.

Military grocery stores should remain open because Defense Working Capital Fund activities, which include the Defense Commissary Agency, have previously been permitted to operate until their cash reserves ran out. But those funds would dry up if the shutdown extended for months.

Military OneSource is one of the few resources with a still-updating website.

How long will the shutdown last?

No one knows. The last shutdown, which took place during President Donald Trump’s first administration, was the longest and lasted 35 days. Most other shutdowns lasted just a few days, though some have stretched into multiple weeks.",https://www.stripes.com/incoming/r2jlh6-9345136.jpg/alternates/LANDSCAPE_480/9345136.jpg,N,0.0,2025-10-02 16:56:46.697913

The Pentagon released new guidance in a May 29 memo but did not announce it publicly. The Associated Press obtained the memo last week.

While the policy does not change flu requirements for active-duty service members, the Pentagon will no longer compensate members of the National Guard and reserve components of each branch who choose to get the flu shot unless they are activated for 30 consecutive days, a Pentagon official told USNI News.

Requirements for civilians will be determined based on occupational risk, the official said. All healthcare workers will still need to get the flu vaccine.

“The strength of our military is built on the readiness of America’s brave men and women in uniform,” reads the May 29 memo. “To ensure that readiness, the Department invests in force health protection to combat threats from a variety of infectious diseases, including seasonal influenza, or the ‘flu.’ This guidance provides common-sense revisions to the Department’s current flu immunization requirements to continue to support a medically ready force while exercising stewardship of taxpayer dollars.”

The flu vaccine is available at no cost to military health system beneficiaries and can be found at military treatment facilities or clinics that have them in stock, a Defense Health Agency official told USNI News.

Active-duty service members will be given priority at military health system facilities. The flu shots are also available at pharmacies in the TRICARE network or at a TRICARE-authorized provider, the official said.

For the Navy, U.S. Navy ships, operational assets and training commands will be given priority for the flu shot, according to a service memo released on Sept. 26.

Navy operational units and Navy Medicine Readiness and Training Commands must administer the flu shot to sailors by Jan. 15, according to the policy.",https://news.usni.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/8066731-scaled.jpg,N,0.0,2025-10-02 14:56:49.835006

Time 2 Minute Read

Categories: Regulatory

Defense contractors received some clarity into the shutdown plans for the Department of Defense/War (Department) when the Department released a memo outlining its contingency plans during this lapse in funding.

Initially, the Department noted that of its 741,477 civilian employees, approximately 400,000 would be exempted from the shutdown because they are funded by something other than annual appropriations or are necessary to protect life or property. Similarly, not all contracts will be curtailed, depending on the circumstances. Some notes from the memo:

Contracts awarded prior to a lapse in funding may continue to be performed so long as there are obligated funds left on the contract unless the contract requires access to government facilities, “active administration” by Department personnel, or use of government resources that would cause the Department to incur additional obligations.

New contracts, exercise of options, issuance of task orders, and contract extensions are prohibited unless they support an excepted function.

New contracts and extensions may be issued if supporting an excepted function. The Department notes that this is “where delay in contracting would create an imminent risk to the safety of human life or the protection of property, including endangering national security.”

In the memo, the Department provides some examples of activities and functions that would continue to function in the event of a shutdown. Those include:

national security including military and contingency operations, intelligence operations, repair of equipment to support excepted activities, and military support to enforce treaties;

medical/dental care including inpatient care, acute and emergency outpatient care, private care under TRICARE, and veterinary services supporting excepted activities;

acquisition and logistics support including contract administration (such as payment) for contracts funded with prior year funds, activities required to support the Feed and Forage Act (such as clothing, storage, food, etc.);

legislative and public affairs support including Armed Forces Network and legislative affairs activities supporting excepted activities;

education and training in support of excepted activities; and

financial management activities including controlling funds and obligations incurred supporting excepted activities.

The list provided by the Department is much longer and is worth reviewing, particularly for contractors with prime contracts or subcontracts with the Department.

Linkage of infants with their TRICARE sponsor and birth mother (who may also be the sponsor) provides the capability to examine parental and military characteristics of births and associated health outcomes. The current study describes BIHR data methodology and presents population characteristics for a recent, 6-year cohort of live births among military families.

Materials and methods: The study cohort comprised all infants in BIHR data born January 2016 through December 2021. Same-sex multiples were not captured because of difficulty differentiating their neonatal medical records. Infants were identified and linked with sponsors and birth mothers using data from the Military Health System Data Repository and Defense Manpower Data Center, which were also used to derive demographic, military, and medical characteristics. Birth and infant health outcomes were ascertained using diagnosis and procedure codes from medical encounter files, which encompassed all care covered by TRICARE (i.e., across military and civilian facilities). Population characteristics were reported using descriptive statistics, overall and by birth mother beneficiary type: sponsor, dependent spouse, or other. Trends in selected adverse outcomes were also described (i.e., cesarean delivery, preterm birth [<37 weeks' gestation], low birthweight [<2500 g], and birth defects).

Results: There were 632,565 live births identified from 2016 to 2021; birth mother beneficiary type was most frequently dependent spouse (78.0%, n = 493,183), followed by sponsor (17.3%, n = 109,293) and other (4.8%, n = 30,089). Overall, mean maternal age at delivery was 28.4 years; the majority of infants had sponsors who were married (89.3%, n = 564,999), non-Hispanic White (60.7%, n = 384,148), on active duty status (73.1%, n = 462,107), and of any enlisted rank (79.6%, n = 503,848). Most infants' sponsors deployed at least once before their birth (57.0%, n = 360,312), with a smaller proportion deployed during pregnancy (7.5%, n = 47,306). Births were more likely to occur at civilian versus military hospitals, and the proportion of births at civilian hospitals increased over the study period, from 61.6% in 2016 to 69.5% in 2021. Among all infants, 28.2% (n = 178,589) were delivered by cesarean, 7.3% (n = 45,940) were preterm, 5.2% (n = 32,605) were low birthweight, and 3.4% (n = 21,222) were diagnosed with a major structural birth defect in the first year of life; all of these outcomes were more likely to occur among civilian versus military hospital births.",https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/persistent/pubmed-meta-image-v2.jpg,N,0.0,2025-10-02 11:56:38.179133
