Dr. Stephen Ferrara, the acting assistant secretary of defense for health affairs, engaged with installation leaders and Defense Health Agency officials to discuss modernization initiatives and the base’s evolving role within the MHS. Leaders highlighted Travis AFB's strategic role as a readiness hub and a vital link in the Department of Defense’s integrated medical and logistics network.

While visiting David Grant USAF Medical Center, military health leaders showcased the team’s contributions to military medicine. DGMC prepares warfighters, sustains medical proficiency, and enhances medical force readiness through innovation and partnerships. Its mission includes trauma training, global aeromedical evacuation, contingency response, and integrated Veterans Affairs/DHA healthcare delivery models.

“David Grant is not just a hospital -- it’s a critical piece of the readiness and logistics infrastructure that connects the medical mission to global mobility operations,” said Col Patrick Parsons, 60th Medical Group commander and DGMC’s director. “What happens here directly supports the warfighter anywhere in the world.”

DGMC leaders emphasized the importance of joint training initiatives, which include training medics, nurses and trauma teams alongside civilian partners, recognizing this integrated approach will be essential in future conflicts, while also enhancing vital medical skills for high-quality patient care at home.

They also showcased ongoing efforts to bolster workforce resilience through clinical training, expanded readiness rotations, and robust academic affiliations. These initiatives aim to ensure the medical force remains adaptable and prepared for emerging challenges.

During a town hall at DGMC and throughout his visit, Ferrara expressed his deep appreciation for the staff's commitment, professionalism, and ongoing impact on military medicine. He also emphasized the vital role Travis AFB plays in developing a resilient and ready medical force, capable of responding globally with speed and efficiency.

“I deeply value these visits because they provide an opportunity to see firsthand the incredible work being done and the unique capabilities that drive our mission forward,” Ferrara said. “Most importantly, I want to thank our medical professionals at Travis for their unwavering dedication to caring for patients, pursuing excellence, and training the next generation of medical professionals who will carry this mission into the future.”

When someone thinks about what people use their insurance for, they often think about things like broken bones, long-term illnesses, and cardiac events. However, there are other complex conditions a person can use their Tricare insurance to get help for that they may not know about.

Substance use disorders cause physical and psychological damage to people who suffer from them. The disorders can be overcome when a person attends a licensed professional treatment program that treats people who have an addiction to alcohol or drugs. For this reason, Tricare drug and alcohol rehab coverage in California is available to those who need help finding a way to heal from their dependence on substances.

About Tricare Insurance

Tricare is an insurance company that provides comprehensive coverage for military personnel, retirees, and their families. Approximately 9 million

customers use Tricare insurance when visiting physicians, nurses, physician’s assistants, clinics, hospitals, and behavioral healthcare clinicians. Tricare offers health plans, special programs, prescriptions, and dental plans, and most of their plans meet the requirements for coverage provided under the Affordable Care Act.

What Types of Rehab Programs in California Does Tricare Cover?

Tricare is in-network with Bright Future, which means several types of rehab programs can be accessed to help people in all stages of recovery enroll in the right treatment plan for their specific needs. Upon acceptance to a program, each person will receive an assessment to determine which level of care is right for them.

Tricare drug and alcohol rehab coverage in California can be used when attending the following types of programs:

Detox:This is the beginning step in treatment for people who have substance use disorders. A detox program usually takes seven to ten days.

Residential:After attending detox, a residential program provides the multi-disciplinary treatment a person needs to continue the work begun during detoxification. Residential programs typically run from 30 to 90 days.

Partial Hospitalization Program (PHP): PHP requires the person to travel to a facility for their treatment sessions and then return home. Appointments take place for several hours per day on weekdays.

Intensive Outpatient Program (IOP):IOP requires attendance for several hours each week, which gives people time to commit to personal and professional obligations.

Does Tricare Cover Detox?

Tricare covers detoxification programs because they provide people with the structured and nurturing care they need as they navigate the first several days of their recovery.

Does Tricare Cover Residential Rehab?

Once a person completes detox, they can use their coverage to enroll in a residential rehab. They will live in a comfortable facility so they can have round-the-clock care that helps them manage their withdrawal symptoms.

Does Tricare Cover Outpatient Treatment?

Outpatient treatment includes two levels of care. They both match the individual with life-saving therapy modalities, with the only difference being how many hours per week they attend appointments.

Does Tricare Cover Therapy?

Attending therapy provides people who struggle with substance use disorders with the ability to learn how to identify and disarm their triggers to drink or use drugs.

For beneficiaries in Bandera, Bexar, Burnet, Caldwell, Coke, Comal, Concho, Gillespie, Guadalupe, Kendall, Kerr, Kimble, Llano, Mason, McCulloch, Menard, Reeves, San Saba, Tom Green, Travis, and Williamson counties, the date has been extended from July 17 to July 27.

To receive an emergency refill of prescription medications, TRICARE beneficiaries should take their prescription bottle to any TRICARE retail network pharmacy. If the bottle is unavailable or the label is damaged or missing, beneficiaries should contact Express Scripts, Inc., or their retail network pharmacy for assistance.

To find a network pharmacy, beneficiaries may call Express Scripts at 1-877-363-1303, or search the network pharmacy locator.

If possible, visit the pharmacy where the prescription was filled. Prescriptions filled by a retail chain may be filled at another store in that chain. If the clinician who prescribed the medication is available, beneficiaries can ask them to call in a new prescription to any network pharmacy. As a reminder, TRICARE beneficiaries, other than active duty service members, may receive urgent care from any TRICARE-authorized urgent care center or provider and do not need a referral. This allows beneficiaries to seek nonemergency care for illnesses or injuries if their primary care provider is unavailable because of emergencies. Any TRICARE beneficiary who reasonably believes they have an emergency should always call 911 or, go to the nearest emergency room.

Beneficiaries are advised to visit Express Scripts’ Weather Notices page for updates.

The Defense Health Agency provides health services to 9.5 million beneficiaries, including uniformed service members, military retirees, and their families. The DHA operates one of the nation’s largest health plans, the TRICARE Health Plan, and manages a global network of more than 700 military hospitals, clinics, and dental facilities.

I’m adhering to my military branch’s instructions on keeping physically fit and eating nutritiously, but I’m having trouble getting rid of some excess pounds from my last duty station, where I mostly sat at a desk. How can I lose those pounds in a healthy way?

Sincerely,

U.S. Air Force Major G. Luke Gagon

--

To achieve optimum body weight composition (your fit-to-fat ratio) you’ll need to commit to regular exercise and a nutritious diet. Should these lifestyle changes not result in reaching your fitness goals, you may consider discussing weight-loss treatment options with your healthcare provider, including medications that may be appropriate for your specific medical needs and TRICARE coverage.

That’s the message from Dr. Marc Alaric Franzos, a cardiologist at the Uniformed Services University in Bethesda, Maryland. He emphasizes regular physical activity and a heart-healthy Mediterranean-style diet for maximum physical fitness and overall health.

--

“Lifestyle modification is relatively straightforward. It's exactly what you would expect—move more, eat less, and sleep well,” Franzos said.

Ideally, service members should aim for cardiovascular health that includes “at least 150 minutes, maybe up to 300 minutes of moderate exertion, aerobic activity per week,” said Franzos. “If you're doing vigorous exercise where you're getting up into heart rate zones above 85% [of maximum], you can actually cut it down to 75 to 150 minutes per week, but ultimately that means you're still moving quite a bit, and that's a minimum.”

“Regular, vigorous exercise where you can’t carry on a conversation can be hard to maintain session-to-session, so most of your effort should be in the moderate zones.” Franzos. “It can even include walking if you walk briskly.” This weight-bearing exercise helps “maintain the muscle on the bones, but also the bones themselves,” because you want to “avoid osteoporosis, or thinning out of the bones.”

“Diet can be used for comfort, it can be used for celebration, it can be used for friendship, but it's also important to recognize that it's fuel,” for the warfighter, said Franzos.

The Trouble with Losing Weight is Keeping it Off

Losing excess weight is hard to begin with, but so is keeping it off, Franzos said.

When lifestyle modifications don't achieve desired results, MHS beneficiaries who struggle with weight loss should discuss treatment options with their healthcare providers. Treatment approaches may include medications that are appropriate for their specific medical conditions and covered under their TRICARE benefit. Coverage for weight management medications varies based on medical indication and TRICARE enrollment status.

""Healthcare providers are best positioned to evaluate individual patient needs and determine appropriate treatment options, including newer medications that may be available,"" Franzos noted. ""Traditional weight-loss medicines have typically achieved modest results, with some newer treatments showing improved effectiveness when combined with lifestyle changes.""

‘Trust in Your Military Health System’ and Don’t Go It Alone

Franzos cautioned strongly against service members or other beneficiaries ordering medications via mail or from outside the U.S., especially as alternatives to proper medical supervision or because of concerns about treatment access.

“It's just too easy to order something mail order and end up getting a product that may not even contain any GLP-1ra,” Franzos said, but instead, “it may contain other substances which could be very hazardous to your health.”

“I would tell our service members to have trust in your Military Health System, and make an appointment with your primary care doctor, to discuss options and determine if it’s a good option for you.” Military sports medicine and obesity medicine specialists are also available, he noted.

“We've taken a lot of effort to learn about it and ensure that we can give proper counseling, proper guidance, and monitor for the adverse effects that may come up from these medications,” Franzos said.

“But I guarantee you that the first thing out of your doctor’s mouth is going to be, ‘Let me talk to you about lifestyle modification,’ and they're going to reinforce that, and they're going to want you to prove to them that you've taken genuine efforts on that front for about three to six months.”

--

Thanks to Dr. Franzos for his guidance on how to lose weight safely, be physically fit, and stay heart healthy at the same time.

Major, now is the time to get your weight checked and look for other possible causes of weight gain besides inactivity and unhealthy foods.

The Nurse Advice Line (NAL) is also available 24 hours a day, seven days a week. Nurse(s) on call will discuss patient’s concerns and provide recommendations for home treatment/care if applicable, and whether the issue should be addressed via an UCC or emergency department visit.

Additionally, per TRICARE policy, active-duty patients will need a referral to be seen at any network urgent care clinic, which can be requested through the Nurse Advice Line.

Active-duty personnel who have access to acute care at their respective commands should utilize their command care providers for administrative needs such as SIQ Chits. Active duty personnel can also call the Nurse Advice Line after hours to coordinate a referral to a nearby UCC.

Or, have you just married a uniformed service member? If you’re new to TRICARE, you may have some questions about how to enroll in a plan, get care, and learn more about your coverage. So, what exactly is TRICARE?

“TRICARE is the uniformed health care program for service members, retirees, their family members, and other eligible beneficiaries,” explained Malcolm Jones, a TRICARE subject matter expert at the Defense Health Agency. “It brings together the resources of military hospitals and clinics with a network of civilian health care providers and pharmacies.”

TRICARE covers:

Active duty service members and their family members

National Guard and Reserve members and their family members

Retirees and their family members

Survivors

Certain former spouses

Medal of Honor recipients and their family members

Dependent parents and parents-in-law (In some locations, they may be eligible for TRICARE Plus, a program offered at some military hospitals and clinics.)

Foreign force members and their family members

Are you in one of these groups? Keep reading to learn more about the basics of using your TRICARE benefit.

Eligibility

Your uniformed service personnel office determines your TRICARE eligibility.

To check your eligibility, first make sure your information is fully updated in the Defense Enrollment Eligibility Reporting System. Sponsors are automatically registered in DEERS, but they must register their eligible family members by going to a local ID card office. (Note: You should call first, or set up an appointment online, to check appointment availability.)

Then, log in to milConnect to check if you’re eligible for TRICARE. Once you’ve registered on the milConnect website, you can update your contact information in DEERS and view your TRICARE enrollment information.

Health plans

Choosing a plan

You have different TRICARE health plan options depending on your sponsor’s status, your relationship to your sponsor, your age, and where you live.

To see which plans you may be eligible for, check out the Plan Finder Tool and answer a few simple questions. Then, you can use the Compare Plans Tool to figure out which plan is right for you. (Note: Families can have split enrollment, meaning some family members can enroll in one plan, while others enroll in a different one.)

Enrolling in a plan

Once you know your plan, visit TRICARE Enrollment for steps on how to enroll or purchase a plan. These steps may differ depending on the plan you choose and where you live.

Are you a new active duty family member? Once you’re registered in DEERS, you’ll be automatically enrolled in a TRICARE plan based on where you live and the plan selection of your other family members who aren’t active duty service members. You have 90 days from the automatic enrollment date to change to a different plan (TRICARE Prime, TRICARE Select, TRICARE Prime Remote, or the US Family Health Plan, if available).

Changing plans

Interested in switching your TRICARE plan? You may have the opportunity to do so during the annual TRICARE Open Season in the fall each year. Changes you make during open season will take effect Jan. 1 of the following year.

You may also be able to change your plan when you experience a TRICARE Qualifying Life Event. QLEs are certain life changes that open a 90-day window for you and your family members to make eligible enrollment changes, as described in the TRICARE Qualifying Life Events Fact Sheet.

Common QLEs include, but aren’t limited to:

Marriage, divorce, or annulment

Birth or adoption of a child (or placement of a child by a court in a member’s home)

Moving

Activation or deactivation

Retirement or separation

Losing or gaining other health insurance

If you experience a QLE, make sure to update DEERS right away.

Getting care

Regions

TRICARE is available worldwide, and your benefits are the same no matter where you live. But different regional contractors help deliver the benefit around the world. If you get civilian health care, this means you’ll reach out to different customer service contacts depending on where you live.

There are two TRICARE regions in the U.S.:

East Region

West Region

And there is one Overseas Region.

To learn which region you’re in, visit Regions.

Military hospitals and clinics

The DHA operates military hospitals and clinics. You may be able to seek care there, depending on where you are, what plan you have, and your beneficiary group.

Civilian network

You can also seek care from a civilian network of TRICARE-authorized providers. This network depends on your region.

To search for a network provider, use the Find a Doctor Tool to get you to the right provider directory.

Note: You may be able to see a non-network TRICARE-authorized provider, depending on your TRICARE plan. But you may have higher out-of-pocket costs, and you may have to file your own claims.

ID cards

For most beneficiaries, you’ll need to show your Uniformed Services ID card to your provider as proof of TRICARE coverage. If you’re an active duty service member, you’ll need to show your Common Access Card.

Coverage

TRICARE covers treatments, procedures, prescription drugs, or devices that are medically necessary and considered proven. Learn more about how a service becomes a TRICARE-covered benefit.

You can use the Covered Services Tool to see if a service is covered by TRICARE or not. You can search by keyword or browse common categories.

Pharmacy, dental, and vision coverage

TRICARE offers prescription drug coverage and several options for filling your prescriptions. You have the same prescription coverage with almost any TRICARE health plan. (Note: If you’re enrolled in USFHP, you have separate pharmacy coverage.)

To check if your prescription drugs are covered, use the TRICARE Formulary Search Tool.

Dental coverage is separate from TRICARE’s medical coverage. Depending on your beneficiary group, you may get dental care through:

Military dental clinics

Active Duty Dental Program

TRICARE Dental Program

Federal Employees Dental and Vision Insurance Program

Vision coverage, including eye exams, depends on:

Who you are

Your TRICARE plan

Your age

Costs

Each TRICARE plan has different costs for care and coverage. See TRICARE Costs to view and compare costs for covered services, enrollment fees, and plan premiums.

Who Is the Health Insurance Provider, TRICARE?

TRICARE is the health insurance program operated by the U.S. Department of Defense as part of its Military Health System. The official brand dates to the mid-1990s. However, its origins can be traced to the 1966 establishment of CHAMPUS (Civilian Health and Medical Program of the Uniformed Services), as the government expanded care to military retirees and dependents.

Launched in its current form between 1995 and 1997, TRICARE offers a comprehensive suite of health plans to diverse groups, including active-duty service members, military families, retirees, National Guard/Reserve members, young adults, and Medal of Honor recipients. Key plans include TRICARE Prime (HMO‑style), TRICARE Select (PPO style), TRICARE for Life (Medicare wrap‑around), Reserve Select/Retired plans, and Young Adult coverage. Specialty services can include pharmacy, mental health, dental, ECHO for dependents with special needs, and overseas care, demonstrating a role as the civilian-care arm of military healthcare.

What Is TRICARE Health’s Online Treatment Coverage?

TRICARE online mental health coverage in Texas is provided through its telemedicine benefit, offering real-time Video conferencing therapy and audio-only care. Your online treatment sessions for counseling, medication management, or urgent behavioral support are eligible for reimbursement when delivered by TRICARE-authorized providers in your region. Services use secure, HIPAA-compliant platforms that connect you with licensed professionals throughout Texas.

Routine outpatient therapy and more structured programs are typically covered but may require prior authorization before beginning treatment. TRICARE Select and Prime similarly support teletherapy visits and virtual counseling, ensuring continuity of care even when in-person options are limited. This growing modality broadens access, reduces wait times, and maintains quality of care, especially when you live in remote areas of the state or have travel restrictions.

Does TRICARE Insurance Cover Virtual Mental Health Therapy in Texas?

TRICARE does cover virtual mental health in Texas, including counseling, psychiatry, medication management, and crisis support over secure telehealth counseling platforms. Therapy and psychiatric appointments may be delivered through video or audio-only calls, with TRICARE-authorized providers eligible for reimbursement without a separate benefit. You may not need a referral or prior authorization for standard outpatient digital mental health services.

However, it is important to verify your coverage before beginning treatment, so you do not receive a surprise medical bill. Remote psychotherapy sessions use HIPAA-compliant platforms, ensuring confidentiality and quality care. Prior authorization is required if your provider determines virtual intensive programs are medically necessary. You can confidently use your TRICARE benefits for virtual mental health services in Texas, whether for weekly talk therapy or medication support.

Does TRICARE Health Insurance Cover Virtual Dual Diagnosis Therapy for Texas Young Adults?

TRICARE does cover virtual mental health therapy for dual diagnosis in young adults, addressing mental health and substance use disorders in an integrated and coordinated manner. TRICARE’s telehealth benefit includes online individual and group psychotherapy, family counseling, medication management, and crisis support for co‑occurring conditions when delivered by authorized providers over secure video or audio platforms.

Young adults enrolled in TRICARE Prime, Select, or the TRICARE Young Adult program can remotely access this support, provided services are medically necessary. Routine virtual visits may not require prior authorization, though more intensive outpatient care does. This means you can receive online psychiatric help for mental health conditions and substance use disorders without leaving home, ensuring seamless care tailored to your needs, and expanding your path to recovery.

Which Online Treatment Programs Are Covered by TRICARE Insurance in Texas

TRICARE’s telehealth coverage in Texas supports a range of online treatment programs to improve mental well-being through structured therapy, group support, medication management, and crisis intervention. These digital therapy sessions foster consistency, accessibility, and continuity of care to promote recovery.

Online IOP Covered by TRICARE

Online PHP Covered by TRICARE

Online Outpatient Programs Covered by TRICARE

Online IOP Covered by TRICARE

An online Intensive Outpatient Program (IOP) is a structured, clinically supervised treatment plan when you need more support than weekly therapy but don’t require inpatient care. Virtual IOPs offer multiple sessions per week, using sessions conducted through secure video platforms. This flexible approach allows you to receive comprehensive mental health care while maintaining your daily responsibilities.

TRICARE provides coverage for web-based mental health support that includes IOP services when they are medically necessary and delivered by TRICARE network providers. Depending on your plan, you may be eligible for this level of care that doesn’t require hospitalization. Prior authorization is typically required. When you call BreakThrough by BasePoint, we can confirm your eligibility with your regional contractor and help meet prior authorization requirements before beginning care.

Online PHP Covered by TRICARE

A virtual Partial Hospitalization Program (PHP) is an intensive treatment option when you need daily therapeutic support but do not require hospitalization.

Coverage details may vary based on your location and provider, so it’s important to verify benefits. You can do this quickly and easily by calling BreakThrough by BasePoint.

Online Outpatient Programs Covered by TRICARE

An online outpatient program is a flexible, virtual mental healthcare format when you need regular mental health support without requiring daily intensive sessions. Delivered through secure video or audio, cybertherapy typically includes weekly counseling and medication check-ins. This model allows you to stay connected with your provider, applying new coping strategies and maintaining your routines while focusing on recovery.

TRICARE covers online outpatient programs when delivered by TRICARE-authorized providers and are medically necessary. You may not need prior authorization or referrals for routine outpatient teletherapy, though active-duty members may have additional requirements.

How to Get TRICARE Health Insurance to Pay for Online Mental Health Treatment

To get TRICARE to cover your virtual mental health services, confirm your eligibility, understand your plan benefits, and ensure you’re working with a TRICARE-authorized provider. Depending on your plan, you may need a referral or prior authorization, especially for intensive services like IOP or PHP. At BasePoint, we take care of this process for you.

It’s helpful to understand the key insurance terms in your benefits. For example, the underwriting process assesses the company’s risk and liability associated with insuring you. An actuary uses this information to calculate the probability of loss, which determines your premium. A policy may include exclusions to limit your coverage or an umbrella policy to offer wrap-around services, such as in TRICARE for Life, which supplements Medicare. Once a claim is submitted, the information is evaluated by an insurance adjuster to determine the appropriate settlement. Call us today at 972-325-2633, and we’ll handle the paperwork and coordination so you can focus on getting better.

How Many Times Will TRICARE Insurance Pay for Virtual Mental Health Therapy in Texas?

Unlike most private insurance companies, TRICARE does not impose a strict cap on the number of digital therapy sessions you can receive in Texas, as long as the services are medically necessary and delivered by a TRICARE network provider. However, there are some important guidelines. You can receive unlimited sessions when your provider can document medical necessity.

Depending on the level of care, you may need prior authorization before receiving treatment to demonstrate medical necessity and confirm care from an in-network provider. Prior authorization is typically granted in 30- to 90-day blocks of time. This ensures flexibility for your online treatment, which maintains an appropriate level of oversight for ongoing care. We understand that taking the first step towards receiving treatment can feel overwhelming, which is why we handle most of the administrative burden for you, allowing you to focus solely on your treatment.

Data show that online mental wellness can help reduce the stigma attached to mental health, may help those with limited mobility, and is compatible with public health guidelines during highly infectious seasons.

Respondents were more likely to say that mental health telehealth offers the same quality, and younger adults were more likely to use it than older adults.

Online therapy allows you to receive mental health care in the privacy of your home and access providers on a flexible schedule. However, therapy sessions can be impacted by unstable internet connections and may not be comfortable for people who need help with in-person communication skills.

A 2023 review of 24 studies revealed virtual interventions had higher odds of remission and lower posttreatment symptom severity in people who received treatment as usual or were on a waiting list for treatment.

A 2022 study demonstrated that virtual group therapy was equally effective and safe as in-person therapy and had the same attendance level with improved accessibility and acceptability.

Santa Cruz is facing a lawsuit from the American Beverage Association and allied industry groups over its newly enacted soda tax, escalating a legal fight that could have far-reaching implications for local public health policy in California.

Approved by voters in the November 2024 election, Measure Z imposes a 2-cent-per-ounce tax on distributors of sugar-sweetened beverages. Public health advocates have championed this and other similar taxes as a way to reduce consumption of sugary drinks—a leading contributor to diabetes, obesity, heart disease and dental decay.

The lawsuit, filed May 28, 2025, argues that the tax violates the Keep Groceries Affordable Act of 2018, which prohibits California cities and counties from creating new taxes on groceries, including beverages, through January 1, 2031. Included in the act was a penalty that would have stripped a local authority of its sales and use tax revenue should it impose a new grocery–related tax or fee.

However, in 2023, the California Third District Court of Appeals invalidated the financial penalties that once enforced the moratorium, allowing Santa Cruz to move forward with the tax without fear of financial repercussions.

CMA’s long-standing advocacy on sugary beverages

The California Medical Association (CMA) has long supported evidence-based public policies aimed at reducing the health harms associated with sugar-sweetened beverages. Through legislative advocacy and public health partnerships, CMA has backed proposals to impose excise taxes, restrict marketing to children and mandate clear labeling of sugary drinks.

While CMA is not directly involved in the Santa Cruz lawsuit, the association is closely monitoring the case for its potential implications on broader public health policy. CMA policy recognizes the urgent need to reduce consumption of sugary drinks as part of a larger strategy to combat preventable chronic diseases.

“My surgeon recommended me to go to Penrose Cancer Center, which I’ve been working with very closely, now,” Hong said.
He initially received 12 rounds of chemotherapy at the center, but the cancer spread to his liver and stomach.
That took him all the way to the Army Trials, where he earned a spot on Team Army and a trip to the 2025 Warrior Games.
Aside from his U.S. Army teammates, he credits the team at Evans and at Penrose with helping him recover.","As he trains for the 2025 Department of Defense Warrior Games in July, U.S. Army Sgt. 1st Class David Hong attributes his success to “a real team”—though, he’s not talking about his fellow athletes on Team Army.

“I’ve had a team of people that went through my journey, from the platoon sergeants, the squad leaders, my nurse case manager … they’ve participated in my ‘scrimmages,’ my meetings and appointments,” he said.

The team captain: His primary care physician at the time, Paul Haufe, a physician assistant at Evans Army Community Hospital at Fort Carson, Colorado, who encouraged Hong to get a routine colonoscopy at age 50.

“He initiated all of this,” said Hong. “He was always there for me from the get-go, even behind the scenes.”

When Hong received a lifechanging diagnosis, stage 4 colon cancer, his doctor urgently formed a comprehensive care team to start treatment: Specialists, nurses, and other dedicated personnel within the Military Health System.

“They were my coaches, they pushed me,” Hong said.

A cancer diagnosis, a path to recovery

When Hong was due for his first routine colonoscopy in July 2022, his primary care physician “didn’t give me a choice,” he said.

“It was the second time my PCP recommended that I get the screening done. I actually refused to do it because I was busy,” Hong said. “He was going to talk to my command to make sure that I went through with that referral to do the colonoscopy … so I went.”

Besides, he said, he felt fine.

The screening caught a cancerous blockage in his colon, which Hong credits the preventive screening with saving his life.

“These types of cancers, people are getting younger and getting them—they are preventable,” he said. At Hong’s encouragement, twelve chaplains he worked with scheduled their colonoscopies.

He was immediately connected to the gastrointestinal specialist, surgical team, and nurses within Evans.

“It was right at the hospital, and with their capabilities—they were able to have all the resources there to do the cancer removal there the following week,” Hong said.

He had part of his colon removed, but the cancer spread to his lymph nodes. The following month, he started chemotherapy at CommonSpirit Penrose Cancer Center in Colorado Springs through the TRICARE health plan network, which gives access to a wide range of healthcare services by TRICARE-authorized providers—offering streamlined access and reduced costs to nonmilitary hospitals and clinics.

“It was a combination of treatments” through both hospitals, he said, that started his recovery journey.

“My surgeon recommended me to go to Penrose Cancer Center, which I’ve been working with very closely, now,” Hong said. He initially received 12 rounds of chemotherapy at the center, but the cancer spread to his liver and stomach.

Hong went through a total of 23 treatments of chemotherapy and had several surgeries to remove the cancer, as well as part of his liver and stomach lining. He kept up with treatment and appointments through Maria Schuch, the nurse case manager assigned to the Fort Carson Soldier Recovery Unit—a support system that he credits with a proactive approach to his care.

“Right from the beginning, she was really engaged, and she knew what she needed to provide. She was on top of all my referrals. It really was teamwork,” he said. “Get connected with a nurse case manager. They aren’t there to babysit you, and they make sure all your records are updated.”

While he recovered, he found adaptive sports therapy through the Soldier Recovery Unit, a program within the Army Recovery Care Program at Fort Carson, Colorado, and participated in archery, cycling, and field events. That took him all the way to the Army Trials, where he earned a spot on Team Army and a trip to the 2025 Warrior Games. While at the trials, he was awarded “Heart of the Team” from his fellow athletes.

Aside from his U.S. Army teammates, he credits the team at Evans and at Penrose with helping him recover. “They’re all excellent in their own way. They’ve been providing the same care, very professional and on top of things,” he said. “It’s a blessing.”

Service rooted in faith, recovery in adaptive care

Hong, a religious affairs specialist who joined the U.S. Army as a chaplain’s assistant, knows from both perspectives that seeking help is a sign of strength. Chaplains, he learned, are often the first line of defense when service members may be struggling.

“We screen soldiers that may have issues, and we try to link them up with the right resources,” he said. “We try to work very closely with behavioral health, because I think our culture in the military, any branch, if you show any type of weakness—especially mentally—people may get scared or afraid, you know, because they don’t know that resources are out there.”

As one who sought mental health support himself, he encourages anyone to talk to a chaplain for support.

“I think as religious affairs and chaplains, we bring a different perspective. We can introduce you to a resource that might work for you,” he said. “It’s always the safety of the individual that is important. We try to give them all the resources necessary, especially with mental health.”

Backed by team on the way to the games

On the sidelines are Hong’s cheerleaders: his wife, Monica, and family who has been his support throughout all of his health challenges.

“Going to cancer treatment with my wife, having her there next to me, having my sister, going through my treatment— there are days that I didn’t want to do it,” he said. “My children are everything.”

He also credits his military leadership and fellow chaplains for being there for him.

“They were there to sacrifice their time and then all the phone calls that (I made) whenever I needed to talk to somebody like the chaplains, friends, even the leadership, they were there checking up on me. I think that’s so important.”

Hong is also finding strength through his fellow wounded warriors, as they shared stories of recovery and resilience leading up to the Warrior Games.

“When I went to the Army trials, I heard everybody’s different story. And I was like, ‘wow, I want to be part of this,’” he said. “I was seeking a community. It’s so therapeutical and so good for you to be part of a mission.”

Hong is still receiving care, and he feels like he’s in good hands through continued monitoring and checkups: “It’s all hands on deck and they’re doing all of the things they should be doing.” It’s because of his healthcare team, he said, that he can still serve in the U.S. Army.

“It’s harder because I’m not able to do the job that I want to do because of my health, and it took time for me to process, but I’m still here,” he said. “Maybe (serving) can be a different, in the way of helping soldiers and their families and the veterans—a different kind of position, maybe part of a plan to give strength to others who might be going through something similar.”

While at the games in Colorado Springs, he plans to pay homage to a particular healthcare team member while competing: Schuch, his nurse case manager at the SRU.

“My manager’s mom passed away, and she’s from Ireland. So, I’m going to put the Irish flag on my bike and dedicate it for her mom.”

For Hong, his participation at Warrior Games is much bigger than winning. It’s all part of being a team.

“Obviously we want to win because we’re competitive, but we also want to win in every way, shape in life,” he said. “I didn’t get here on my own. I did put in the work, but if you can’t find that fire in yourself, you’ll find people around you that will help you get there.”

About a month ago I received a Medicare card (I'm 63, 64 in October) and literature about it.

Apparently if you are on SSDI they auto sign you up roughly 24 months after receiving the benefit.

Here's the deal. I'm 100 service connected through the VA and use the VA solely. The wife retired early and is utilizing Tricare Select as her health insurance. This would allow me to use it as well if we are traveling and there is no VA close by.

The law states that when I am eligible for Medicare I have to sign up or we lose tricare benefits.

I'm sure most people welcome Medicare because they can utilize the benefits. The issue is I don't want to start paying yet if I am not 65, especially since I have comprehensive care already.

Tricare doesn't know... After talking to 3 people.

The conversion factor is the multiplier used to determine Medicare reimbursement rates for physician services.
Hospital outpatient and ASC payments: Hospital outpatient fees and ambulatory surgery center payments would increase by 2.4% in 2026.
CMA has opined that any savings from reducing the hospital facility fee should be reinvested in the Medicare fee schedule for all physician practices.
Overall, the proposed fee schedule falls far short of addressing physician payments that have declined by 33% (adjusted for inflation) since 2001.","July 17, 2025

The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) this week released the proposed 2026 Medicare Physician Fee Schedule and Quality Payment Program rule. Most physicians would see an average 3.6% conversion factor increase, while qualifying Alternative Payment Model (APM) participants would receive an average 3.83% conversion factor bump. The fee schedule also includes two additional conversion factors for anesthesia services.

The conversion factor is the multiplier used to determine Medicare reimbursement rates for physician services. The increases are due to a one-year 2.5% increase provided by Congress in HR 1, an additional 0.75% increase for APM participants and a 0.25% increase for all other physicians based on current the Medicare Access and CHIP Reauthorization Act (MACRA) law and a 0.55% increase due to work relative value unit (RVU) changes.

But the conversion factor increase is only part of the story. CMS is also proposing structural reforms that could significantly reshape how physicians are reimbursed—including a major shift in site-of-service payments and new efficiency adjustments.

Key provisions include:

New site-of-service payment adjustments: CMS proposes increasing indirect cost payments by an average 4% for services delivered in non-facility (e.g., office-based) settings, while reducing payments by an average 7% for the same services in facility settings (i.e., outpatient hospital settings and ambulatory surgery centers). The change aims to reduce hospital consolidation and ensure payment parity across care settings. It would result in a nearly $280 billion reduction in payments to hospitals. (See the payment impact table here by specialty and site of service.)

New efficiency adjustment: CMS proposes a new -2.5% adjustment to work RVUs for all CPT codes except time-based codes (e.g., E/M visits). According to CMS, the goal is to better reflect service intensity and rebalance valuation between primary care and procedural services.

Telehealth policy updates: CMS is proposing to permanently adopt a revised definition of “direct supervision” that would allow supervising physicians to be immediately available via real-time audio/video technology. However, CMS plans to end current flexibilities that allow teaching physicians to be virtually present when billing for services involving residents after December 31, 2025—returning to pre-pandemic in-person supervision requirements. An exception would remain for rural areas. CMS did not add the telemedicine E/M office visit codes to the authorized Medicare Telehealth Services List effective for 2026.

MIPS: CMS will maintain the 75-point performance threshold to avoid a penalty for the 2026–2028 performance years/2028–2030 payment years.

ACOs: CMS is limiting Medicare Shared Savings Program accountable care organization participation in one-sided financial risk models to 5 years.

New mandatory payment model: Beginning in 2027, CMS will test a five-year model in select regions for physicians treating heart failure or low back pain, with payment adjustments of up to ±9%.

GPCI update: CMS has updated the Geographic Practice Cost Index that upon initial analysis is accurate for California.

Hospital outpatient and ASC payments: Hospital outpatient fees and ambulatory surgery center payments would increase by 2.4% in 2026.

AMA survey data: In a controversial move, CMS said it will not rely on the new AMA Physician Practice Information Survey for Medicare Economic Index weighting of practice expenses, or on AMA RVS Update Committee (RUC) survey data for RVUs. CMS cited concerns about low physician response rates, incomplete data, and evidence that physicians may overstate the time and intensity required for certain procedures—leading to overvaluation of some services. This shows CMS’ intent to transition away from the AMA RUC process.

While CMA is concerned about the negative impact of higher hospital site-of-service (facility fee) payments on independent physician practices, we will be thoroughly reviewing the impact of the proposal on the viability of all practices. CMA has opined that any savings from reducing the hospital facility fee should be reinvested in the Medicare fee schedule for all physician practices.

Overall, the proposed fee schedule falls far short of addressing physician payments that have declined by 33% (adjusted for inflation) since 2001.

“While we appreciate CMS working to stabilize primary care, Congress continues to fail to address the decades of underpayment that threaten all physician practices and patient access,” said CMA President Shannon Udovic-Constant, M.D. “Without permanent, inflation-adjusted reforms, physicians will continue to face financial instability—and patients will pay the price by not being able to find a physician taking Medicare patients.”

CMA is reviewing the proposed rule in full and will submit comments. Stay tuned for more details.

The counties affected are Atlantic, Bergen, Burlington, Camden, Cape May, Cumberland, Essex, Gloucester, Hudson, Hunterdon, Mercer, Middlesex, Monmouth, Morris, Ocean, Passaic, Salem, Somerset, Sussex, Union, and Warren.

To receive an emergency refill of prescription medications, TRICARE beneficiaries should take their prescription bottle to any TRICARE retail network pharmacy. If the bottle is unavailable or the label is damaged or missing, beneficiaries should contact Express Scripts, Inc., or their retail network pharmacy for assistance.

To find a network pharmacy, beneficiaries may call Express Scripts at 1-877-363-1303, or search the network pharmacy locator.

If possible, visit the pharmacy where the prescription was filled. Prescriptions filled by a retail chain may be filled at another store in that chain. If the clinician who prescribed the medication is available, beneficiaries can ask them to call in a new prescription to any network pharmacy.

As a reminder, TRICARE beneficiaries, other than active duty service members, may receive urgent care from any TRICARE-authorized urgent care center or provider and do not need a referral. This allows beneficiaries to seek nonemergency care for illnesses or injuries if their primary care provider is unavailable because of emergencies. Any TRICARE beneficiary who reasonably believes they have an emergency should always call 911 or, go to the nearest emergency room.

This reality was at the heart of a recent engagement between leadership from U.S. Naval Hospital (USNH) Rota and Hospital Universitario Puerta del Mar, one of southern Spain’s premier public medical centers.

Hospital Universitario Puerta del Mar, operated under the Andalusian Health Service (Servicio Andaluz de Salud), serves as a regional hub for complex care and advanced diagnostics. For U.S. military medical planners, it represents a key node in the extended care network that supports readiness for warfighters and dependents stationed throughout southwestern Spain.

“Our presence in Europe depends on more than just facilities, it depends on trusted relationships with host-nation partners. We work within their established systems, aligning closely to integrate in a seamless, responsive way that enables us to meet our mission effectively,” said Capt. Michael Mercado, Director of USNH Rota.

The dialogue between institutions focused on interoperability: how to streamline referrals, coordinate specialty care, and ensure language and procedural alignment during both routine and emergent situations. Additionally, the teams explored opportunities for simulation exercises and shared clinical education that would benefit both systems.

Mr. Jose Luis Guijarro, Managing Director of the Puerta del Mar – San Carlos University Hospital, underscored the value of sustained, bidirectional cooperation. “Our mission is to provide essential public health, but we recognize the broader regional role we play. Working closely with USNH Rota strengthens our own preparedness and deepens our ties with the international community.”

The engagement reflects a broader Defense Health Agency (DHA) objective in building sustainable partnerships with local and allied institutions to enhance collective readiness and resilience. In an environment where medical threats do not respect borders, the ability to operate fluidly within host-nation systems is a strategic advantage.

Whether coordinating emergency response, managing complex referrals, or sharing innovations in care delivery, Hospital Universitario Puerta del Mar and USNH Rota continue to model how allied cooperation in healthcare can advance both mission success and community well-being.

Strategically positioned on the Iberian Peninsula, the hospital plays a critical role in defending, restoring, and elevating the health of warfighters and their families. USNH Rota provides ready, reliable care to 8,400 service members and their families.

The myAuth system is based on a commercial product, rebranded for the Defense Department, which provides cloud-based ""identity as a service"" capabilities to the department.
The legacy DS Logon is not the only system being replaced by myAuth, though it is the largest.
Although the target for decommissioning the DS Logon is 18 months, Gill said users can log in to myAuth now and set up an account using their DS Logon credentials.
""And one of the cool features from myAuth that DS Logon did not have is the help feature.","Over the next 18 months, the Defense Department will replace the legacy DS Logon system, which authenticates users onto more than 200 DOD and Veterans Affairs websites, with a more modern and flexible system called myAuth.

The new authentication system offers a range of features that will simplify the login process for approximately 20 million individuals who use it, including military personnel, DOD civilians, military and civilian retirees, family member beneficiaries, contractors and vendors.

The myAuth system is based on a commercial product, rebranded for the Defense Department, which provides cloud-based ""identity as a service"" capabilities to the department. It is hosted on a secure DOD cloud and has been authorized by the Defense Information Systems Agency, said Zachary R. Gill, the branch chief of identity credential access management and partner services within the Defense Manpower Data Center.

Gill said one of the significant advantages of myAuth is that it provides secure access for individuals, such as retirees and beneficiaries, who may not have a common access card and cannot authenticate into a system using certificates contained within a CAC. However, the system also provides access options for individuals who have a CAC but may not be able to utilize it in certain circumstances.

For example, he presented a scenario in which a soldier or civilian employee might be traveling on orders booked through the Defense Travel System. At the airport, problems with the airline may mean the orders need to be changed, but since the traveler does not have access to a CAC-enabled computer, this poses a challenge.

""With myAuth, you would be able to provide an alternative credential, and therefore, you'd be able to access DTS from your personal cellphone and update your travel orders or make changes,"" Gill said.

He added that a CAC will no longer be the only way to access systems. Other methods, on a case-by-case basis, will provide the user with a variety of login options.

The myAuth utilizes Okta Verify, which can be installed on a personal or government-issued cellphone and will serve as a means to provide CAC-free access. The app includes biometric capabilities for both face and fingerprint recognition.

Gill said the methods of access allowed are set by the system owner, but myAuth can do it all.

""For instance, if I'm accessing DTS, the DTS application may say it needs a higher-level assurance for people to be able to access it,"" he said.

Gill described a CAC as authenticator assurance level three, the ""gold standard"" for authentication. However, lower levels of authentication could also be used if a system's administrators permit it.

Not everybody in the community who will be served by myAuth has a CAC or a smartphone, Gill said. And the things they need to access might not require the highest levels of authentication. The myAuth system will flex to meet their needs.

""In our community, we serve a lot of members that may not have access to smartphones and may not have access to technology,"" he added. The legacy DS Logon is not the only system being replaced by myAuth, though it is the largest. Gill said other systems in use throughout DOD will also be shuttered and replaced by myAuth.

""There are multiple authentication systems across the department that each department is paying for individually, which means each department is paying for sustainment costs or licensing costs,"" he said. ""myAuth will collapse those one-off systems, providing an enterprise solution.""

A key performance metric for myAuth is system availability, the assurance that the system will always be available to authenticate users into critical Defense Department systems. Gill said the target for system availability with myAuth is that it be available to serve users 99.99% of the time.

Although the target for decommissioning the DS Logon is 18 months, Gill said users can log in to myAuth now and set up an account using their DS Logon credentials. If users wait until after DS Logon is gone, he said the process to create a new account will require reverifying the user's identity if they do not have a CAC. Active-duty service members and DOD civilians with a CAC will likely have no problem transitioning to myAuth, he said, adding that their daily use of systems that currently offer both DS Logon and myAuth as authentication methods will be a reminder to sign up for an account.

However, for the significant portion of users who do not use DOD systems daily, such as retirees, family members and contractors, Gill said getting the word out is a top priority.

""We've started executing our communications plan. We've already sent out several million emails to our community to let them know,"" he said, adding that the Defense Manpower Data Center has partnered with the Defense Health Agency to let users who access related Tricare-related systems know about the switch.

Gill said the myAuth website also provides assistance.

""If you hit the myAuth page, we have a new help section,"" he said. ""And one of the cool features from myAuth that DS Logon did not have is the help feature. So, when you go to myAuth, there's a button that [is labeled] 'help.' And when you click that, it's going to break down everything about what myAuth is, how to log in, frequently asked questions and what creating a new account looks like.""

As of July 14, 2025, over 740,000 DOD-affiliated personnel have created myAuth accounts. Importantly, the success rate for self-service account creation exceeds 99%, minimizing the need for users to contact the call center.",https://media.defense.gov/2025/Jul/17/2003756074/1280/1280/0/250605-D-D0439-001.JPG,N,0.0,2025-07-17 12:56:49.923762

Covered services

You can use online visits for many types of care. These include:

• Primary care, including on-demand nonemergency care

• Preventive care

• Telemental health care

• Specialty care

• Remote monitoring for serious chronic conditions

Before you book a virtual health visit, call or visit your regional contractor’s web page. Some types of care need a referral or pre-authorization.

Do you get your care at a military hospital or clinic? Many of these virtual health services may be available there. Contact your provider for more information. If you’re an active duty service member, you need a referral and pre-authorization from your primary care manager for virtual health care.

As described in the TRICARE Mental Health and Substance Use Disorder Services Fact Sheet, virtual mental health services have the same referrals and pre-authorization requirements as your in-person mental health care.

Costs

Virtual health costs are similar to in-person costs. Your costs depend on who you are, health plan, and type of appointment. Note that you’ll need to pay your usual cost-shares and copayments for virtual visits.

What you need

To use virtual health services, you need:

• A computer or smartphone (for video care)

• A telephone (for telephone-only care)

• A secure phone or internet connection

• Referrals or pre-authorizations (if required)

Overseas

Do you live outside the U.S.? You can still use virtual health services if:

• The care is a TRICARE-covered benefit and is appropriate for virtual health.

• The country where you receive care allows virtual health.

• The provider is licensed and TRICARE-authorized and has a license to practice in the country where you receive care.

• The provider knows your location and how to contact help in a medical or mental health emergency.

• The provider follows all local health care and virtual health rules.

TRICARE will cover your virtual health care if you meet these requirements.

TRICARE For Life and Medicare

Do you have TRICARE For Life? Medicare usually pays first for virtual visits. This includes phone calls with your doctor. Remember to check what Medicare and TRICARE cover before scheduling an appointment. TRICARE pays first if Medicare doesn’t cover a service.

Autism Care Demonstration

TRICARE covers services for parents of children with autism. This includes applied behavior analysis guidance. These services are under the Autism Care Demonstration.

TRICARE’s virtual health options make it easier for you to access health care services. It’s a great way to get care when you can’t visit a doctor’s office in person.

With more than 15 years of service at BJACH and nearly three decades in the nursing profession, Boone’s career has spanned nearly every corner of the hospital — from inpatient care and family medicine to forensic nursing and referral management.

Boone began her time at BJACH in the Progressive Care Unit, a high-acuity inpatient ward that managed telemetry patients and post-operative recoveries. She later supported the transition of the Family Medicine Clinic to a Patient-Centered Medical Home model, served as a virtual health care coordinator, and worked in the Soldier Centered Medical Home.

Today, she serves as a nurse consultant in managed care, helping patients navigate complex referrals, TRICARE authorizations and specialty care through the civilian network. “You never know what burden someone is carrying when they call,” Boone said. “Sometimes it’s a medical issue, sometimes it’s something more personal. When they reach me, they can rest assured they’re talking to someone who will advocate for them.”

In addition to her primary duties, Boone is one of three certified Sexual Assault Medical Forensic Examiners at BJACH. Over the past several years, she has devoted more than 1,600 hours of on-call time, providing professional, compassionate care to individuals impacted by sexual assault and mentoring new forensic nurses across the installation. “It’s one of the most meaningful roles I’ve ever had,” she said. “From the moment they walk into the ER, we’re with them — making sure they’re supported, respected and never alone.”

Her commitment extends beyond any one department. Boone frequently steps in to assist during staff shortages across BJACH — in the emergency room, labor and delivery, family medicine and more. “Cyndi goes above and beyond to ensure patient care remains a top priority,” said Sabrina Cobb, Boone’s supervisor. “She mentors others, supports mission readiness, and leads by example — all without ever asking for recognition.”

Boone said her approach to nursing has always been rooted in service. “I’ve got a servant’s heart,” she said. “That’s just who I am. You treat people the way you’d want your family to be treated.”

Whether supporting a patient through a challenging diagnosis or helping a new nurse learn the ropes, Boone said she feels honored to serve the Fort Polk community. “As long as I’m able, I’ll keep doing what I can to help,” she said. “I’m grateful to be here — and grateful to be part of a team that cares this deeply.”",https://dha.mil/-/media/Project/Images/News-Images/9182518.jpg,N,1.0,2025-07-17 12:56:59.886496

FORT RUCKER, Ala. — The Fort Rucker community welcomed Taylorville native Col. Thomas A. Summers as U.S. Army Aeromedical Research Laboratory commander, and bid farewell to outgoing commander, Col. Matthew H. Hoefer, during a Change of Command ceremony at the U.S. Army Aviation Museum June 25, 2025.

The Commander is the son of Tom and Helen Summers. They attended the ceremony with about 20 more family members.

Summers and his wife, Anne-Marie, are the parents of three daughters, Riley, Shanna and Vanessa.

Maj. Gen. Paula C. Lodi, U.S. Army Medical Research & Development Command and Defense Health Agency Director for Research and Development commander, welcomed attendees and thanked family members for their support.

“What USAARL does is truly important, groundbreaking and impressive,” Lodi said. “The audience in attendance is a testament to that.”

Lodi recognized senior leaders not only from across the Aviation Center of Excellence and Fort Rucker, but also Army Futures Command, other MRDC laboratories, and the surrounding community.

She said Summers brings a wealth of medical expertise to USAARL and described him as a transformational leader.

“He is known for his rare combination of strengths in strategic planning and operations,” Lodi said. “In addition to being a highly accomplished, highly intelligent, and extremely capable leader, Tom has an innate ability to make all things fun, which is why he is a welcome addition to every assignment.”

Summers arrives at USAARL from his most recent duty position as the Assistant Chief of Staff, Support Operation, Medical Readiness Command East and Chief Medical Officer, Defense Health Network East.

Among his previous assignments, he served as a Staff Pathologist, Hematopathologist, Pathology Residency Program Faculty, Director of Immunohistochemistry Section, and Director of the Murtha Cancer Center Biobank at Walter Reed National Military Medical Center; Brigade Surgeon, 210th Field Artillery Brigade, Camp Casey, ROK; Medical School Faculty, Uniformed Services University; Chief, Department of Pathology, Fort Belvoir Community Hospital; Command Surgeon and Senior Medical Officer, United States Army Cadet Command; and Chief Surgeon, Army Recovery Care Program, MEDCOM G-3/5/7.

Summers is a board certified Anatomic and Clinical Pathologist with subspecialty board certification in Hematopathology. He is a Fellow of College of American Pathologists.

He attended St. Mary School and Taylorville Junior High School and is a graduate of Waubonsie Valley High School, Aurora, Ill. He holds a Master of Business Administration from Southern Illinois University, a Master of Strategic Studies from the U.S. Army War College and is completing a Master of Health Professions Education from the University of Illinois Chicago.

Summers is a member of the College of American Pathologists International Accreditation Committee.

Summers has been awarded multiple awards and decorations throughout his career plus the Expert Field Medical Badge, the Flight Surgeon Badge, and the Parachutist’s Badge.

He welcomed and thanked attendees, family, soldiers, and those who participated in the Change of Command ceremony and made it possible.

“Every day,” Summers said as he addressed the USAARL staff, “your research saves lives, improves readiness, and ensures our service-members have the best possible protection as they carry out their missions.

As we look to the future, I am committed to building upon the strong foundation laid by those who came before me,” he said. “We will continue to foster a culture of scientific rigor, innovation, and teamwork. We will remain agile and responsive to the evolving needs of Army aviation and the broader medical community. Above all, we will never lose sight of our mission,” Summers concluded.

Lodi praised Hoefer’s service to the Army and aeromedical research as he prepares to transition to his next assignment as the Medical Corps, Deputy Corps Chief, at Defense Health Headquarters, Falls Church, Va.

“As commander, Matt not only led the team to advance USAARL’s mission,” Lodi said, “but also guided the organization through a period of significant transformation and change that accompanied MRDC’s alignment with the Defense Health Agency.”

Lodi said Hoefer “is recognized for his calmness under pressure and his forward-thinking management style, as well as his ability to unite diverse teams. Your ability to drive progress will be an asset in your upcoming assignments” Lodi said.

“This lab’s future is bright because of your focus on delivering whatever the DOD needs to make our warriors safer, more lethal and more capable on the battlefield,” Hoefer said in a farewell message to USAARL. “Keep innovating, keep looking for new ways to support our teammates, and keep up this great USAARL culture.”

Hoefer asked the USAARL staff to stand for a moment during the ceremony. “Continue to fight for the opportunities that make Army aviation more lethal, accelerate us into autonomy and save American warriors,” Hoefer challenged the USAARL staff.

“Your work has been essential for aviators over the past 60 years and I’m excited to see what you deliver for Army aviation in the future,” Hoefer said.

Politics have largely stayed out of Julie Linton’s South Carolina pediatrician’s office over the years — that is, until recently. The Greenville physician has seen an uptick in the number of parents feeling reluctant or refusing to vaccinate their children.

Anti-vaccine messaging stemming from Washington D.C. isn’t helping, she says.

“We have people at the highest levels of government sharing information that causes hesitancy, and that’s deeply troubling,” Linton said. “I worry very much about messaging aligning with science, and that’s not happening.”

Linton was one of dozens of pediatricians who came to Capitol Hill on Tuesday to encourage lawmakers on both sides of the aisle to ensure continued access to routine shots for kids, a month after the Trump administration cleaned house at the leading federal vaccine advisory committee.

They came to warn lawmakers that Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr.’s move to replace the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s vaccine advisory panel with some members skeptical of vaccines could hinder access to free shots for low-income children and children in military families. It could even lead to some private insurers no longer covering the shots, they said.

The CDC’s Vaccines for Children program and military health care program TRICARE both rely on that panel to determine which vaccines are available at no cost for children, and many private insurers do the same.

Although the vaccine drama has played out at agencies like CDC, Congress could step in.

A House bill from Democratic Reps. Frank Pallone Jr. of New Jersey and Kim Schrier of Washington aims to shield the vaccine panel from political interference by specifying its structure, membership selection process and meeting frequency and ensuring that HHS cannot override the committee’s decisions without sufficient explanation.

But such a move would require Republican buy-in, and there are no Republican cosponsors on the legislation.

Democratic Sen. Lisa Blunt Rochester of Delaware has said she plans to introduce a bill that would prevent the HHS secretary from terminating members of Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices without cause and would require the secretary to reinstate the fired members.

In the weeks since the committee shakeup, Senate Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee Chair Bill Cassidy, R-La., has questioned the lack of scientific experience among the new committee members but hasn’t suggested legislation is needed. The pediatricians on Capitol Hill Tuesday said they hoped Republican members might use their influence with the administration to sway Kennedy.

A post-pandemic divide

Partisanship surrounding vaccinations, especially those for children, increased during the pandemic with skepticism surrounding the COVID-19 shots. Pediatricians say the dispute has spread to more routine immunizations, especially the measles, mumps and rubella shot.

Toni Richards-Rowley, the vice president of the Pennsylvania chapter of the American Academy of Pediatrics, who participated in the Capitol Hill outreach, practices in Bucks County, a Republican-leaning area that she says is experiencing increased vaccine hesitancy.

“This is an issue born out of tremendous success with vaccines,” Richards-Rowley said, noting that many parents making vaccine decisions for their children have the benefit of past vaccine success against viruses that give rise to measles or whooping cough. But as more families decline vaccinations, diseases rebound.

Richards-Rowley said she and her colleagues now have to retrain themselves on how to treat ailments that were once considered extinct.

Raynard Washington, health director for Mecklenburg County in North Carolina, said in an interview that he’s seen a gradual increase in vaccine exemption requests for kids in public schools, especially religious exemptions, which don’t require extensive verification.

“We’re not seeing similar upticks in medical exemption,” he said. “So that’s sort of how we know it’s likely driven by vaccine hesitancy or resistance in the community.”

School nurses in the area are fielding more questions from families getting information from sources like TikTok, he said. The county has reacted with a program that trains “vaccine champions” to answer technical questions and respond to misinformation and disinformation in settings such as child care centers or faith communities.

Washington noted there was an effort in the North Carolina legislature to create a new category of vaccine exemptions for personal objections, which ultimately didn’t come to fruition. Republican lawmakers in the state also introduced a bill in February that would repeal the state’s vaccine requirements for college students.

Stoking the fire

As doctors sought to assure lawmakers of the benefits of immunization, some Republicans this week were focused on the opposite.

Sen. Ron Johnson, R-Wis., who chairs the Senate Committee on Homeland Security and Government Affairs Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations, held a hearing Tuesday titled “Voices of the Vaccine Injured,” featuring people who lost loved ones or had medical issues after being vaccinated.

“We all fear death and disease,” Johnson said in his opening remarks. “The appeal of a simple shot that can prevent both is obvious and powerful. Unfortunately this strong appeal has overridden critical thinking and prevented rigorous cost-benefit analysis from being done.”

Sen. Richard Blumenthal, D-Conn., called the hearing disrespectful and a disservice to public health.

“There have been persistent falsehoods about vaccines continuing to harm our communities. And this misinformation is not only driving down vaccination rates, it’s compromising research into the very harms that we need to prevent,” Blumenthal said.

Still, the senators on both sides of the aisle appeared to find common ground on reforming the vaccine injury compensation program, which allows people to submit claims about injuries from vaccines to see if they may be eligible for compensation.

Public health experts like Richard Besser, the president of the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation and a former CDC official, see such hearings as further undermining trust in vaccination.

He said HELP chair Cassidy needs to call a hearing and hold Kennedy accountable for the sweeping changes he’s made to vaccine policy.

“I think that Congress is letting the American people down,” Besser said.",https://rollcall.com/app/uploads/2025/07/pallone_BC_044_050625-1.jpg,N,0.0,2025-07-17 09:56:23.877246

However, about a month and a half ago when I was at the pharmacy and my prescription was outrageously priced and the nice lady asked me for my Social Security number. I was like oh it should be my husband Social Security number. Did it finally click. I went home and logged into my old Humana account and there I found all my 2025 TRICARE claims rejected. (mind you this was my active Duty TRICARE account.)

I called TRICARE right away and talked to them and they pulled all 22 claims and saw that they were in fact billed to my dependence beneficiary ID (the one ending in -01). And that it was a system error. It took about a month for them to take action on the work order. And they said another 30-60 days for them to actually process. This update is of today, July 16, 2025.

There still has been no resolution. I’ve had to pay all of these bills, and thankfully, I can’t afford to pay all these bills and once everything is rectified, all the providers will be required to pay me back the money that is over my deductibles. So that should be fun.

If you guys are having issues and can’t figure it out, and your claims are not showing up in Humana I would definitely check to see if they’re floating around on your old active duty accounts.

Good luck everyone and fare winds!",,N,-1.0,2025-07-17 06:56:23.283414

“To maintain U.S. military superiority, we cannot afford to politicize our policies for recruiting, developing, and retaining the best and brightest.”","From the Office of U.S. Rep. Gabe Vasquez:

WASHINGTON, D.C. — On July 15, 2025, U.S. Rep. Gabe Vasquez (NM-02) – a member of the House Armed Services Committee (HASC) – voted in favor of the bipartisan Fiscal Year 2026 National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA).

“It is vital that we ensure America’s armed forces have the training, equipment, and resources they need to carry out their missions,” Vasquez said. “This bipartisan bill includes my legislation to improve health care for our rural veterans, give our troops a pay raise, recognize New Mexico’s Downwinders, and add many additional provisions that support service members and their families across our state.”

The Fiscal Year 2026 NDAA includes $882.6 billion in defense spending, national security investments, and support for our military. This includes funding for research and development, a 3.8% pay increase for our troops, and investments to support service members and their families. The bill passed out of Committee by a vote of 55-2 and will now head to the House floor for consideration.

Included in the NDAA are Vasquez’s TRICARE Travel Improvement Act and Downwinder Commemoration Act, which ensure New Mexicans’ needs are met and interests are reflected through the nation’s defense investments.

The TRICARE Travel Improvement Act helps military families serving in remote areas access health care by reducing the travel reimbursement threshold under TRICARE Prime from 100 miles to 50 miles for active-duty service members and their families. Currently, families stationed at White Sands Missile Range and Holloman Air Force Base who travel nearly 100 miles to El Paso for medical care are denied reimbursement due to being just under the threshold. This bill is a step toward fairness and affordability for New Mexico’s military families.

The Downwinder Commemoration Act recognizes the harm endured by New Mexico’s Downwinders following the 1945 Trinity Test — the first nuclear detonation in U.S. history. It directs the Departments of Defense and Interior to place commemorative monuments in publicly accessible areas at White Sands Missile Range and Holloman Air Force Base. Despite their exposure to radioactive fallout, Downwinder families were excluded from the Radiation Exposure Compensation Act (RECA) until Rep. Vasquez’s successful push to reauthorize and expand RECA to include New Mexico’s Downwinders. This bill helps deliver long-overdue recognition by permanently commemorating their suffering while preserving their legacy for future generations.

In addition to these two measures, Rep. Vasquez secured the following priorities in NDAA:

Infrastructure & Safety:

White Sands Missile Range (WSMR) Power Grid: $38.5 million for power generation and a microgrid at WSMR under the Energy Resiliency and Conservation Investment Program (ERCIP)

Kirtland Air Force Base Space HQ: $83 million for Space Rapid Capabilities Office Headquarters construction at Kirtland Air Force Base

Holloman Air Force Base Test Track: Report language highlighting the importance of Holloman’s High Speed Test Track and requiring a report on the timeline for constructing a new parallel track

Cannon Air Force Base Dorms: $90 million for dorms at Cannon Air Force Base

PFAS Cleanup: Language protecting mandated annual reports on DOD PFAS contamination and cleanup efforts, to ensure states like New Mexico have continued visibility into PFAS contamination

PFAS Technology: Report language requiring DOD to partner with universities like NMSU to develop cutting edge technology to detect and cleanup PFAS contaminants

Unexploded Ordinance:

Native American Lands Environmental Mitigation Program: Report language holding DOD accountable for cleaning up unexploded ordinance (UXO) on Tribal lands like the Pueblo of Isleta

Rural Issues:

Rural Housing: Report language requiring DOD to partner with local housing authorities in rural areas to address shortages of housing around remote and isolated installations like WSMR and Holloman Air Force Base

Specialty Healthcare at Rural Bases: Report language highlighting the challenges service members and families face at rural installations when accessing specialty healthcare and requiring a report on ways the Department can improve specialty provider accessibility

Holloman Air Force Base Childcare: Report language encouraging DOD to expand the in-home childcare pilot program to four rural installations, including Holloman Air Force Base

National Labs/DOE:

Los Alamos: $1.55 billion for plutonium operations, including ensuring the capacity to produce 30 plutonium pits annually

Other Bill Highlights:

Pay Raise: 3.8% pay raise for all service members

Housing: $1.5 billion for new construction of dorms, barracks, housing, and child development centers

Ukraine: $300 million for Ukraine Security Assistance Initiative

Environment: $460 million for environmental cleanup and $684 for the Energy Resilience and Conservation Investment Program

“As this critical legislation continues to make its way through the House, I will keep working to improve it,” Vasquez added. “To maintain U.S. military superiority, we cannot afford to politicize our policies for recruiting, developing, and retaining the best and brightest.”",https://ladailypost.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/favicon_30.ico,N,0.0,2025-07-16 21:56:46.258502

With more than 15 years of service at BJACH and nearly three decades in the nursing profession, Boone’s career has spanned nearly every corner of the hospital — from inpatient care and family medicine to forensic nursing and referral management.

Boone began her time at BJACH in the Progressive Care Unit, a high-acuity inpatient ward that managed telemetry patients and post-operative recoveries. She later supported the transition of the Family Medicine Clinic to a Patient-Centered Medical Home model, served as a virtual health care coordinator, and worked in the Soldier Centered Medical Home.

Today, she serves as a nurse consultant in managed care, helping patients navigate complex referrals, TRICARE authorizations and specialty care through the civilian network.

“You never know what burden someone is carrying when they call,” Boone said. “Sometimes it’s a medical issue, sometimes it’s something more personal. When they reach me, they can rest assured they’re talking to someone who will advocate for them.”

In addition to her primary duties, Boone is one of three certified Sexual Assault Medical Forensic Examiners at BJACH. Over the past several years, she has devoted more than 1,600 hours of on-call time, providing professional, compassionate care to individuals impacted by sexual assault and mentoring new forensic nurses across the installation.

“It’s one of the most meaningful roles I’ve ever had,” she said. “From the moment they walk into the ER, we’re with them — making sure they’re supported, respected and never alone.”

Her commitment extends beyond any one department. Boone frequently steps in to assist during staff shortages across BJACH — in the emergency room, labor and delivery, family medicine and more.

“Cyndi goes above and beyond to ensure patient care remains a top priority,” said Sabrina Cobb, Boone’s supervisor. “She mentors others, supports mission readiness, and leads by example — all without ever asking for recognition.”

Boone said her approach to nursing has always been rooted in service.

“I’ve got a servant’s heart,” she said. “That’s just who I am. You treat people the way you’d want your family to be treated.”

Whether supporting a patient through a challenging diagnosis or helping a new nurse learn the ropes, Boone said she feels honored to serve the Fort Polk community.

“As long as I’m able, I’ll keep doing what I can to help,” she said. “I’m grateful to be here — and grateful to be part of a team that cares this deeply.”",https://api.army.mil/e2/c/images/2025/07/16/d8aa057c/max1200.jpg,N,1.0,2025-07-16 21:56:54.390482

Village mayors represent residents of each housing community on post and meet with installation and community leaders via roundtable monthly, to exchange information.

Lt. Col. (Dr.) Reginald Trevino, Munson acting director, and Dr. Elizabeth Hersey, chief of Primary Care briefed key health care updates relevant to incoming and current military families.

Dr. Trevino recognized installation leaders at the meeting for a great youth sports camp put on earlier in the week and reminded families that as the school year approaches, Munson is offering school, sports, and Child & Youth Services (CYS) physicals. To schedule call Munson's appointment line weekdays from 7 a.m. - 4 p.m. at 913-684-6250. Parents are encouraged to bring all required paperwork, as forms can vary by institution and activity.

Hersey emphasized the importance of ensuring that Defense Enrollment Eligibility Reporting System (DEERS) information is updated after PCS to reflect residence at new duty locations because that is the information used to establish eligibility for care whether in a military treatment facility or on the network.

“Making sure service members update DEERS helps us enroll family members and streamlines access to care,” Hersey said. Once DEERS is updated call 1-888-TRIWEST (874-9378) and follow the prompts to establish a primary care manager at Munson.

Dr. Hersey highlighted that while Munson offers a full spectrum of primary care, it does not have an emergency room.

“We have pharmacy, lab, physical therapy, radiology, and other services—but for emergencies, always call 911 or go to a nearby hospital,” she reminded attendees.

Hersey also announced the expansion of Munson's virtual health capability through Scheduled Virtual Visits.

“With Scheduled Virtual Visits, you can access sessions quickly and easily through any internet-connected smartphone, laptop or computer. It’s HIPAA-compliant, convenient, and ideal for those who’d rather not load up the kids to come in for a quick consult,” she said. “Now, many appointments that normally require an in-person visit can be done virtually.”

Trevino concluded by welcoming questions and reminding families that Munson is committed to supporting the health and readiness of the Fort Leavenworth community.",https://d1ldvf68ux039x.cloudfront.net/thumbs/photos/2507/9183717/1000w_q95.jpg,N,0.0,2025-07-16 18:56:23.485892

“We finished at one o’clock this morning,” said committee member Rep. Jen Kiggans (R-VA02) of Virginia Beach in a Wednesday morning interview with WAVY. The Pentagon spending plan now goes to the full House.

The House and Senate’s versions of the defense budget are aligned on a pay raise for military personnel with a pay hike of 3.8%.

“Although I feel like I can never give them enough for the work and the service they provide to our country, a 3.8% pay raise is important,” Kiggans said.

Shipbuilding in the House’s version of the defense budget comes in at $13 billion, higher than the Senate’s $8.5 billion. Whatever the final figure, Kiggans says it will fill a gap that’s on congress’ radar.

“The lack of ships that we have in the Navy, we know that our old ships continue to get older, and we need to make sure that we provide that funding from congress so that we can not only sustain the fleet, but grow the fleet,” she said.

Kiggans wants the Navy to catch up with other branches of the military and get the Pentagon to commit F-35 fighters to Naval Air Station Oceana. It’s a campaign she mounted more than a year ago.

“I have been a staunch advocate and very vocal advocate for bringing F-35s, the next generation strike fighters, Naval Air Station Oceana,” Kiggans said.

Kiggans is a Navy veteran helicopter pilot but also a nurse practitioner. She’s proud that the House defense budget improves the TRICARE system for medical providers.

“We’ve seen a lot of our community care partners really struggling with adequate and timely compensation from TRICARE, so we address that in this year’s NDAA,” Kiggans said.

Thousands of active-duty servicewomen seek abortion care each year, according to a 2023 RAND report.

Mikie Sherrill (NJ-11) introduced an amendment to the FY2026 National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA) that would repeal the longstanding federal ban on abortion care in the military health system. The amendment strikes Section 1093 of Title X, which prohibits the Department of Defense from providing abortion services in most cases.

Following the Supreme Court’s decision to overturn Roe v. Wade, approximately 40% of women in uniform are now stationed in states that ban or severely restrict abortion access. Even the narrow “exceptions” permitted under current law have proven unworkable in practice, putting the lives and health of servicewomen at risk.

Thousands of active-duty servicewomen seek abortion care each year, according to a 2023 RAND report. Yet under current law, military doctors and facilities are prohibited from providing that care, even when it’s medically necessary for their health — forcing women to turn to informal support systems or delay treatment.

The amendment seeks to restore full reproductive health care access for all military personnel and their families, regardless of where they are stationed.

Click here(link is external) to watch Sherrill’s full remarks.

Full remarks, as delivered:

“Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk.

Today, across the country, women's reproductive freedoms are under attack. After the Supreme Court’s MAGA majority overturned Roe, nineteen states(link is external) now outright ban or severely restrict abortion access.

My daughters now have less freedoms than I did while growing up. It is unthinkable to me that so many of our servicewomen are already serving with less rights than I had while in the Navy and being stationed in states like Texas or Florida without basic access to reproductive care.

The fact that our military treatment facilities are only allowed to provide abortions in extremely limited circumstances is unacceptable and puts the health and wellbeing of our service members and their families at risk.

The decision to get an abortion is deeply personal and should be made by a woman and her doctor, not by politicians.

Our service members expect that they will receive the best possible health care. But our military healthcare providers can’t even give them an abortion when their health is at risk.

And we know that “exceptions” to abortion bans don’t work. We see horrific stories on the news about women who were denied care that they were SUPPOSED TO receive under an exception, often ending with the mother nearly losing her life.

We have more than 100,000 active-duty service members stationed in Texas. We’ve heard stories of a young woman, who died after experiencing a tragic miscarriage at 17-weeks. After being faced with this devastating loss, her doctors delayed medically necessary and lifesaving care because of the state’s abortion ban. She died as a result of an infection she developed because that care was delayed, leaving behind a young daughter.

In Georgia, another young woman experienced a rare complication with medication abortion where her body did not expel all of the fetal tissue. When she sought out medical care, she waited 20 hours before doctors were able to operate because of the state’s abortion ban. While she waited, her infection spread and her organs began to fail. Amber’s care came too late and she died as a result of the infection leaving behind a six year old son.

We ask our servicewomen to put their lives on the line for this country. They shouldn’t have to risk their lives giving birth.

But the fact remains that a woman should never need a so-called exception to get an abortion and it shouldn’t need to be an emergency before she can get care. It should be available, a decision a woman gets to make over her own body and her own life.

My amendment would repeal the draconian ban on abortions within the military health system, allowing our servicewomen and military families to have the freedom of access and the freedom to choose.

Thank you and I yield back.”

The House NDAA authorizes $882.6 billion in national defense funding, including a 3.8% pay raise for servicemembers, $3.1 billion in advanced procurement for Virginia-class submarines, and over $18 billion authorized for military construction (MILCON), including $1.5B for barracks, housing, and childcare.
“This year’s NDAA delivers for our men and women in uniform and for the Hampton Roads region that supports them,” said Congresswoman Kiggans.
The bill also advances her initiatives to increase TRICARE transparency for children’s hospitals, study the long-term effects of high-performance flying on pilots, and reduce risks from foreign-made technology in defense systems.
“As a Navy veteran, military spouse, and proud representative of one of the most military-heavy districts in the country, I will always fight to ensure our servicemembers have what they need to succeed—at home and abroad,” Kiggans added.","WASHINGTON, D.C. — Congresswoman Jen Kiggans (VA-02) announced that the House Armed Services Committee completed its mark-up of the Fiscal Year 2026 National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA) last night, which includes several key provisions she championed to support servicemembers, modernize our fleet, and strengthen Hampton Roads’ role in national defense.

This program is administered by Express Scripts — the second largest pharmacy benefit manager (PBM) in the United States — covering 90-100 million Americans, including 9.5 million TRICARE beneficiaries.
This new law negatively impacts Express Scripts and CVS Caremark, a major PBM with 23 retail pharmacies throughout the state that CVS has now vowed to shutter.
Express Scripts — and thus military beneficiaries — appear to be casualties in a political battle in Arkansas that now appears to be spilling east over the Mississippi.
Arkansas’ Act 624, which will hamper TRICARE beneficiaries’ pharmacy access when it goes into effect in January, sets a dangerous precedent that will hurt military retirees and their families.","Like millions of others in the military community, I receive my prescription medications through the TRICARE Pharmacy Program. This program is administered by Express Scripts — the second largest pharmacy benefit manager (PBM) in the United States — covering 90-100 million Americans, including 9.5 million TRICARE beneficiaries.

Shortly after I retired from the Navy in 2009, like most Americans, I remember hearing that if I liked my doctor, I could keep my doctor. I assumed I could keep my pharmacy too. It turns out, however, that in Arkansas, in Tennessee where I retired, and possibly other states like Louisiana, that might not be the case.

Arkansas Act 624, which targets “pharmacy middlemen,” was signed into law by Gov. Sarah Huckabee Sanders in April 2025, prohibiting PBMs or their affiliates from owning or operating pharmacies there. This new law negatively impacts Express Scripts and CVS Caremark, a major PBM with 23 retail pharmacies throughout the state that CVS has now vowed to shutter.

In the lawsuit seeking to overturn the new law, Express Scripts argues that “millions of Americans nationwide and hundreds of thousands of Arkansans rely on PBM-affiliated pharmacies for their prescription medications.” It notes they “served for more than 20 years as the principal mail-order pharmacy provider for the U.S. Department of Defense’s TRICARE program, which provides healthcare services to military members, retirees, and families.”

Unfortunately, there’s now a move in Tennessee to follow the Arkansas bad example and significantly restrict PBMs. State Sen. Bobby Harshbarger, R-Kingsport, is introducing state legislation that would exert more government control to purportedly save costs.

While consumers naturally would like to see lower prescription drug prices, it’s dubious that their prices would actually decrease since PBMs argue they do that already by negotiating rebates and scoring discounts from drug manufacturers at scale.

Moreover, as Tennessee is arguably even more remote than Arkansas, particularly considering the Blue Ridge Mountains, restricting pharmacy by mail will have a terrible impact on military retirees who often live in less expensive, rural areas to survive on pensions.

Express Scripts — and thus military beneficiaries — appear to be casualties in a political battle in Arkansas that now appears to be spilling east over the Mississippi. In their own lawsuit, CVS Health claims, “Act 624 is designed to target CVS Health, not to protect patients. Arkansas lawmakers crafted the law to exclude CVS Health’s pharmacy operations while protecting in-state pharmacy businesses, which often charge higher prices.”

Apparently the original version of the Arkansas bill would have also hurt Bentonville-based Walmart, which was seen as “a dealbreaker” by many lawmakers. Thus they carved out an exemption for Walmart while a top competitor, CVS, ends up leaving the state. Genoa, a subsidiary of UnitedHealth, has said it too is likely to close its 11 pharmacies in Arkansas.

While that’s a great deal for Walmart, it’s not so good for everyone else.

Whether or not PBM reforms are necessary appears to be an exceedingly complex issue across the country that one hopes isn’t being made for the wrong reasons.

Curiously, California Gov. Gavin Newsom recently rejected PBM reforms, vetoing SB 966 over cost and disruption fears, showing even progressive states are hesitant to overhaul PBMs.

Beyond elected officials, critics of PBMs are fairly active on the podcast circuit and news broadcasts. They cite cherry-picked anecdotes of cost differences in some individual cases to rile up audiences about a little-understood topic that impacts basically everyone who needs prescription drugs. Yet these folks typically use half-a-story, and leave out the positive aspects of PBMs — like a robust pharmacy-by-mail service, and more choices on where and how to buy medicines.

Arkansas’ Act 624, which will hamper TRICARE beneficiaries’ pharmacy access when it goes into effect in January, sets a dangerous precedent that will hurt military retirees and their families.

Tennessee shouldn’t follow suit, nor should other states. After military retirees served for at least 20 years on active duty, plus with wars in Iraq and Afghanistan and tens of thousands still suffering from wounds, the last thing we need is to have access to life-saving prescription drugs severely curtailed by state laws. We must do better.",https://www.stripes.com/incoming/m5z3a0-170125dha-pharmacyphoto01.jpg/alternates/LANDSCAPE_480/170125DHA-PHARMACYphoto01.jpg,N,-1.0,2025-07-16 16:56:36.310436

With more than 15 years of service at BJACH and nearly three decades in the nursing profession, Boone’s career has spanned nearly every corner of the hospital — from inpatient care and family medicine to forensic nursing and referral management.

Boone began her time at BJACH in the Progressive Care Unit, a high-acuity inpatient ward that managed telemetry patients and post-operative recoveries. She later supported the transition of the Family Medicine Clinic to a Patient-Centered Medical Home model, served as a virtual health care coordinator, and worked in the Soldier Centered Medical Home.

Today, she serves as a nurse consultant in managed care, helping patients navigate complex referrals, TRICARE authorizations and specialty care through the civilian network.

“You never know what burden someone is carrying when they call,” Boone said. “Sometimes it’s a medical issue, sometimes it’s something more personal. When they reach me, they can rest assured they’re talking to someone who will advocate for them.”

In addition to her primary duties, Boone is one of three certified Sexual Assault Medical Forensic Examiners at BJACH. Over the past several years, she has devoted more than 1,600 hours of on-call time, providing professional, compassionate care to individuals impacted by sexual assault and mentoring new forensic nurses across the installation.

“It’s one of the most meaningful roles I’ve ever had,” she said. “From the moment they walk into the ER, we’re with them — making sure they’re supported, respected and never alone.”

Her commitment extends beyond any one department. Boone frequently steps in to assist during staff shortages across BJACH — in the emergency room, labor and delivery, family medicine and more.

“Cyndi goes above and beyond to ensure patient care remains a top priority,” said Sabrina Cobb, Boone’s supervisor. “She mentors others, supports mission readiness, and leads by example — all without ever asking for recognition.”

Boone said her approach to nursing has always been rooted in service.

“I’ve got a servant’s heart,” she said. “That’s just who I am. You treat people the way you’d want your family to be treated.”

Whether supporting a patient through a challenging diagnosis or helping a new nurse learn the ropes, Boone said she feels honored to serve the Fort Polk community.

“As long as I’m able, I’ll keep doing what I can to help,” she said. “I’m grateful to be here — and grateful to be part of a team that cares this deeply.”",https://d1ldvf68ux039x.cloudfront.net/thumbs/photos/2507/9182518/1000w_q95.jpg,N,1.0,2025-07-16 15:56:28.226508

To find a network pharmacy, beneficiaries may call Express Scripts at 1-877-363-1303, or search the network pharmacy locator (https://militaryrx.express-scripts.com/find-pharmacy).

If possible, visit the pharmacy where the prescription was filled. Prescriptions filled by a retail chain may be filled at another store in that chain. If the clinician who prescribed the medication is available, beneficiaries can ask them to call in a new prescription to any network pharmacy.

As a reminder, TRICARE beneficiaries, other than active duty service members, may receive urgent care from any TRICARE-authorized urgent care center or provider and do not need a referral. This allows beneficiaries to seek nonemergency care for illnesses or injuries if their primary care provider is unavailable because of emergencies. Any TRICARE beneficiary who reasonably believes they have an emergency should always call 911 or, go to the nearest emergency room.

Beneficiaries are advised to visit Express Scripts’ Weather Notices page for updates (https://militaryrx.express-scripts.com/notices/weather).

Jack Brown, 97th Healthcare Operations Squadron TRICARE operations and patient administration non-commissioned officer in charge, from Altus Air Force Base, Oklahoma, who rises to daily challenges while maintaining high standards below.

Can you share a recent experience where you were challenged to perform at your absolute best? What did you learn about yourself through that experience?

I don’t think there is just one experience I have had recently that I was challenged to perform to my absolute best, I try to approach every situation, big or small, with the same mindset and that’s to give whatever my 100% is that day, sometimes I only have 70% but you can count on it that I am going to give you 100% of that 70%.

The Air Force emphasizes both precision and lethality. How do you apply those concepts within your specific role to ensure mission success for Altus AFB?

As a 4A (Health Services Management), precision is the job. In our field, we might be managing patient records, ensuring readiness data is accurate, or even assisting with patient benefits; there is zero room for error, people’s health and mission readiness depend on it. With our team maintaining accurate documentation and streamlined processes, we can make sure that Airmen are medically ready to train and deploy at a moment’s notice. This readiness is where our lethality comes from, ensuring our force is fit, cleared, and capable of carrying out our mission to train exceptional mobility Airmen.

How have you seen the principle of meritocracy reflected in your work environment at Altus, and how does it motivate you to perform at your best?

I have seen the principle of meritocracy implemented throughout the Wing since I arrived four years ago. By this principle being highlighted, it allows Airmen to stand out based on their performance, and being a part of the medical group, that’s no problem!

What specific steps do you take in your role to ensure you and your team are always prepared to execute the mission, even on short notice?

I have recently stepped into a more visible leadership position and my Flight Commander, 2nd Lt. Darby, has an amazing saying, “If you stay ready, you never have to get ready."" I have really tried to embody this saying, and it has begun to allow our team to flourish and become proactive not reactive.

How does your work at Altus directly or indirectly contribute to maintaining the Air Force's lethality on the global stage?

Being in the Health Services Management career field, my work directly and indirectly supports the Air Force’s global lethality by making sure our Airmen are medically ready to deploy and execute at a moment’s notice. 4A’s manage medical records, medical registration, and even readiness data. By ensuring all this information is up to date and accurate, we are helping commanders make informed decisions about their force deployment capabilities. Altus AFB is a vital training hub for aircrew members on the KC-135, C-17, and KC-46. As a 4A, I help ensure the smooth operations of the 97th Medical Group, which in turn supports the health and availability of instructors, students, and support staff. Without reliable medical care, the flow of qualified aircrew into the operational Air Force would slow, reducing global mobility and refueling capabilities. My work might not involve pulling the trigger or flying on a mission, but it is foundational to ensuring that those who do are ready, healthy, and mission-capable, making a huge strategic impact on the Air Force’s ability to project power and defend national interests around the world.",https://media.defense.gov/2025/Jun/25/2003743408/2000/2000/0/250612-F-KP877-1016.JPG,N,1.0,2025-07-16 13:56:28.385401

Notably, our results showed that, in comparison to White beneficiaries, Black and Asian/Pacific Islander beneficiaries were less likely to receive mAbs.","BACKGROUND

Between 2020 and 2022, there were nearly 100,000,000 infections and approximately 1,000,000 deaths attributed to SARS-CoV-2 in the USA.1,2 The development of therapies to prevent severe illness from COVID-19 in high-risk populations became crucial during the early pandemic. Researchers quickly identified monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) as agents that could potentially reduce severe morbidity and mortality from COVID-19.3 Monoclonal antibodies are laboratory-produced antibodies that target a specific protein on a virus to prevent it from entering or duplicating in human cells.4 This mechanism mimics the immune response and assists the body in fighting infections. Therefore, mAbs can be effective in both the prevention and treatment of COVID-19 infection.4

Between November 2020 and February 2021, three mAbs, bamlanivimab, REGEN-CoV (casirivimab-imdevimab), and bamlanivimab-etesevimab, were given emergency use authorization by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the treatment of mild to moderate illness from COVID-19 in adults and pediatric patients who were at high risk for progression to severe COVID-19, hospitalization, or death.5 Despite efforts from the government and healthcare systems to promote equitable distribution of mAbs to disadvantaged populations, data indicates lower mAb uptake among these groups.6 Multiple reviews of healthcare system data within the USA found that White patients were more likely than Blacks and other racial minority groups to receive mAb treatment.6,7 Moreover, high-risk patients without health insurance and patients living in high social vulnerability zip codes were less likely to receive mAbs.6,8,9 Although males were more likely to be hospitalized and admitted to the ICU for COVID-19 infections, national studies found higher uptake of mAbs in females.7,10

Anzeige

To our knowledge, no study has investigated whether the disparities in mAb usage identified across the USA also extend to the Military Health System (MHS). The MHS delivers care to approximately 9.6 million beneficiaries, including both active and non-active-duty service members, dependents, and retirees.11 Unlike the civilian healthcare system, the MHS offers universal insurance coverage to all beneficiaries through TRICARE, typically at no cost to the patient.12 Given that universal insurance has often been linked to increased access to care and reduced health disparities, the MHS may be a valuable model for examining whether there was equitable distribution of mAbs during the COVID-19 pandemic.13 In this context, we examined whether there were disparities in mAb usage within the MHS population by race, sex, and socioeconomic status. We hypothesized that the uptake of mAbs across each demographic category would be similar due to the MHS’s provision of universal coverage to all beneficiaries.

METHODS

Study Design, Population, and Data Source

This retrospective study identified TRICARE Prime and Plus beneficiaries ages 12–64 from November 9, 2020, to January 24, 2022, using claims data from the Military Health System Data Repository (MDR). Beneficiaries were eligible if they received a COVID-19 diagnosis and were seen within outpatient care during the study period. We excluded beneficiaries ages 65 and older due to the loss in transparency of care when Medicare becomes the primary insurance payer. Additionally, due to intermittent access to the MHS, National Guard and Reserves, along with their dependents, were excluded.

Clinical data from the MDR along with International Classification of Disease, 10th Edition (ICD-10) codes were used to identify COVID-19 diagnoses. This study looked at three monoclonal antibody (mAb) treatments: bamlanivimab, casirivimab-imdevimab (REGEN-COV), and bamlanivimab-etesevimab. Treatments were identified using Current Procedural Terminology/Healthcare Common Procedure Coding System (CPT/HCPCS) codes. Based on each mAb manufacturer’s guidelines, ICD-10 codes along with pharmaceutical data from the MDR were utilized to determine if beneficiaries were at high risk of developing severe COVID-19 and/or being hospitalized. All CPT/HCPCS and ICD-10 codes can be found in Table S1.14‐17 We employed the beneficiary’s Defense Enrollment Eligibility Reporting System (DEERS) record to obtain demographic information such as categorical age, biological sex, beneficiary status (active duty, dependent, and retiree), self-reported race (White, Black, Asian/Pacific Islander, American Indian/Alaska Native), sponsor rank (junior enlisted, senior enlisted, junior officer, senior officer, warrant officer), associated branch of service (Army, Air Force, Navy, and Marine Corps), and healthcare setting (direct care and private care) for analysis. Sponsor rank was determined to be a suitable proxy for socioeconomic status as shown in prior studies of TRICARE beneficiaries, with enlisted rank being a correlate of lower socioeconomic status.18,19 Ranks of dependents and retirees are based upon their sponsor’s rank and rank prior to retirement, respectively. Beneficiaries associated with the US Space Force were grouped with those in the US Air Force due to their small sample size. As a result of high rates of missing data, ethnicity (Hispanic or non-Hispanic) was not retained for analysis.

Statistical Analysis

Analyses comprised descriptive statistics on patient demographics and frequency of COVID-19 mAb treatment for all eligible beneficiaries and by sex, race, sponsor rank, and risk status. Unadjusted and adjusted odds ratios (OR) for patient likelihood of receiving mAb treatment were obtained using simple and multivariable logistic regression models for all beneficiaries as well as only those classified as “high risk.” Multivariable models included sex, race, sponsor rank, and risk status as independent predictors for receipt of mAb treatment with beneficiary status and categorical age as potential confounders. To address the high rates of missing race data, we applied the reweighted estimating equations (RWEE) imputation technique to the logistic regression models.20 Observed and weighted frequencies for race are provided in Table S2.

Anzeige

Statistical significance of odds ratio (OR) and 95% confidence interval (CI) were determined, a priori, as exclusive of 1.00 and α = 0.05. This study was reviewed and found exempt by the Institutional Review Board at the Uniformed Services University of the Health Sciences. All statistical analyses were conducted using SAS 9.4 (SAS Institute Inc). We adhered to the Strengthening the Reporting of Observational Studies in Epidemiology (STROBE) guidelines.

RESULTS

We identified 221,036 beneficiaries with a COVID-19 diagnosis receiving outpatient care during the study period, of which 9907 (4.5%) received mAb treatment (Fig. 1). Beneficiaries who received treatment were predominately female (57%), of White race (53%), ages 45–64 (64%), dependents (56%), in an enlisted rank (77%), and not at high risk of developing severe COVID-19 and/or hospitalization (86%) (Table 1).

DISCUSSION

Through this investigation, we sought to assess whether disparities in usage of mAb treatment for COVID-19 existed within the Military Health System between the period of November 2020 and January 2022. After analyzing medical claims data for three prominent mAbs, it was found that 4.5% of TRICARE beneficiaries who were diagnosed with COVID-19 during the study period received mAb treatment. Beneficiaries who were at high risk for severe illness from COVID-19 were more likely to receive mAbs than those who were not at high risk. Despite universal healthcare coverage, disparities in the likelihood of receiving mAbs were observed by race, sex, and sponsor rank, as well as between private and direct care sectors of the MHS.

Notably, our results showed that, in comparison to White beneficiaries, Black and Asian/Pacific Islander beneficiaries were less likely to receive mAbs. This finding is consistent with research conducted within the civilian population that has shown lower uptake of mAbs among certain minority groups. For example, a review of data from the National Patient-Centered Clinical Research Network reported that Black and Asian patients were significantly less likely to receive mAbs than White patients, with a 22% and 48% gap in usage, respectively.7 Additionally, a review of electronic health records from four health systems in the USA found that Black patients were less likely to be treated with mAbs than White patients.6

It has been proposed that a complex interplay of social, cultural, and clinical factors may be associated with rates of acceptance for mAbs among different racial/ethnic groups.21 For example, Bierle et al. found that Black and Asian patients, and those who identified as having a primary language that was not English, were more likely to refuse mAb therapy.21 Factors such as health system mistrust, medical misinformation, and differences in cultural beliefs surrounding medicine that have also been associated with COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy may factor into decisions to accept mAb therapy.22

Despite adjustment for potential covariates, our study revealed that female beneficiaries had a higher likelihood of receiving mAbs in comparison to male beneficiaries. Although this finding aligns with existing studies based on national healthcare system data, which demonstrate slightly higher percentages of mAb uptake by female patients,7,8,10 we hypothesize that our finding is driven by the different arenas in which beneficiaries sought care. Current MHS guidelines prioritize direct care for active-duty service members23, which in 2021 were ~ 83% male.24 Additional factors which may drive this difference have been observed in the greater US population, and include the greater likelihood of females to seek medical attention than males.25,26 For example, a cross-sectional study of adults with confirmed COVID-19 diagnoses in the USA found that females had higher odds of seeking treatment from their physician in comparison to males.27 Alternatively, there could have been implicit biases or systemic issues that led to differences in treatment allocation by sex.28 Nonetheless, our findings are concerning considering the evidence that males with COVID-19 are at higher risk for severe illness, hospitalization, and death, in comparison to females.27,29 These findings are also concerning from a military perspective, as the Armed Forces are majority male and must be fit for duty in order to carry out their mission. Further research is needed to determine the reasons influencing these decisions, particularly for active-duty service members.

One significant finding was the provision of mAbs to patients who were not at high risk from COVID-19 infection. In direct care, 755 of 1029 patients (73.4%) and in purchased care, 7,764 of 8878 patients (87.5%) who received mAbs did not meet the clinical criteria. There are several possible explanations. One is incomplete coding which fails to capture the full scope of patient risk factors; however, it seems unlikely that over 70% of patients in both care sectors were miscoded. A second is social determinants of health which are not normally recorded in a healthcare setting, such as the need to care for family members, or low food security which is independently correlated with COVID-19 infection.30 It is notable that military populations may also experience food insecurity, particularly in the enlisted ranks.31 In our study, enlisted personnel and their beneficiaries comprised approximately 71% of those diagnosed with COVID and 77% of those receiving mAbs, with a slightly higher percentage of those at high risk than not. However, social determinants could not be conclusively identified from our dataset. A third is older age, as those aged 55 + accounted for only 7.7% of those diagnosed with COVID, but 37.1% of those receiving mAbs. This is also the only group where the number of patients receiving mAbs were at high risk vs. not at high risk, and therefore mAb provision in this group may reflect an abundance of caution on the part of providers. Neither our dataset nor the existing literature provides a ready explanation for the use of mAbs outside of high-risk groups, and therefore more research is needed to answer this question.

Strengths and Limitations

This study has several strengths. It constitutes a population-level examination of prescribing practices across over 200,000 patients from multiple socioeconomic and demographic backgrounds. Because this population is nationally representative and predominantly working age, the study is not limited to those of lower income or advanced age, such as studies in the Medicaid and Medicare populations, respectively. As MHS beneficiaries have universal insurance and generally at least one fully employed family member, the results of this study can be used to assess the disparities which persist despite insurance and job status. This study also has several limitations. As a secondary data analysis, it is subject to potential error, including missing data or inaccurate coding, and does not capture clinical nuances that may appear in provider notes, including clinical findings and patient vital signs. Our analysis did not account for any changes in the eligibility criteria for high risk during the study period. This study also does not capture care provided outside the MHS. As race was imputed for non-active-duty beneficiaries, this study may not have captured a full picture of disparities. Finally, this study did not stratify by multiple factors, such as age with rank or gender with race, which limits the granularity of the findings. Further research is needed to answer this question.

CONCLUSION

Despite the provision of universal insurance to MHS beneficiaries, this study showed differences in mAb treatment by race, rank, sex, and care arena. Findings by race and sex are in line with studies in the greater US population, suggesting that factors beyond insurance are affecting the provision of mAbs. While those at high risk of severe COVID-19 and associated complications were more likely to receive mAbs, the greatest number of beneficiaries receiving mAbs were not at high risk. The reasons for this were not determinable from our dataset nor from existing literature, and therefore further research is needed to answer this question.

The agreement resolves allegations that Gilead engaged in an illegal kickback scheme to promote its HIV medications.

Gilead is accused of violating federal anti-kickback laws between January 2011 and November 2017 by providing gifts, travel, and other incentives to health care providers to encourage the prescription of its HIV drugs — including Stribild, Genvoya, Complera, Odefsey, Descovy, and Biktarvy. These actions led to the submission of millions of dollars in false claims to government health care programs.

Of Pennsylvania’s share, $642,189 will go directly to the state’s Medicaid program.

The settlement was coordinated with the U.S. Department of Justice and approved by the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York. Of the total amount, $49 million will support Medicaid programs nationwide, with the rest distributed to Medicare, Tricare, and the AIDS Drug Assistance Program (ADAP).

Gilead reportedly paid high-volume prescribers tens to hundreds of thousands of dollars to act as speakers at promotional events, often covering luxury travel and meals. Internal compliance systems at the company failed to stop the improper conduct.

Attorney General Sunday joined 48 other Attorneys General, along with representatives from the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, and the U.S. Virgin Islands, in securing the settlement.

New York Attorney General Letitia James announced the settlement Tuesday, leading a coalition of 49 attorneys general that accused the pharmaceutical company of using gifts, luxury meals, and paid travel to influence health care providers from 2011 to 2017. New York will receive $6.6 million as part of the $202 million nationwide agreement.

“When pharmaceutical companies put profits before patients, New Yorkers suffer,” James said. “Gilead undermined our health care system with illegal kickback payments, and now they are being held accountable.”

According to the settlement, Gilead paid health care providers tens to hundreds of thousands of dollars to speak at promotional events for its HIV medications, including Stribild, Genvoya, Complera, Odefsey, Descovy, and Biktarvy. The company funded travel to popular destinations like Hawaii, Miami, and New Orleans, and hosted events at high-end restaurants. In New York, venues included Del Posto, Asiate, Palma, and the James Beard House, which hosted 157 of Gilead’s speaker programs.

Federal anti-kickback laws prohibit pharmaceutical companies from offering inducements to influence medical decisions. The investigation found Gilead failed to enforce internal safeguards meant to prevent its sales staff from offering such perks.

The violations included a New York City nurse practitioner who attended 75 dinner programs, including 40 on the same topic repeated multiple times within six months. That nurse often brought a sibling who was not a prescriber. In another case, a group of 10 Manhattan doctors attended or spoke at 384 dinner events—many of which were held within days of one another and often repeated the same content.

The $202 million settlement includes $49 million for state Medicaid programs and additional funds for Medicare, Tricare, and the AIDS Drug Assistance Program. The deal was approved by the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York in coordination with the U.S. Department of Justice.

Attorney General James credited the U.S. Attorney’s Office for the Southern District of New York for its support and thanked staff in her office’s Medicaid Fraud Control Unit for their role in the investigation.

Tropical Storm Barry’s remnants triggered catastrophic flash flooding in Central Texas over the Fourth of July weekend, particularly in Kerr County.
A tropical storm is a type of tropical cyclone with maximum sustained winds ranging from 39 to 73 mph.
While not as intense as hurricanes, tropical storms can lead to widespread flooding, downed trees, infrastructure damage, and disruption of military operations, said Deussing.
Even dissipating tropical storms, like Tropical Storm Barry in early July 2025, brought flash floods and deadly river surges over 100 miles inland.","JULY 16, 2025 – Hurricane season is fast approaching, bringing potential threats to military families stationed in coastal regions, particularly along the Atlantic and Gulf Coasts, but it can also impact families further from the coast as well. When a hurricane or tropical storm is headed your way, preparation can mean the difference between safety and danger.

While hurricanes often receive the most attention, tropical storms, which have sustained winds between 39 and 73 mph, can also bring serious hazards such as heavy rainfall, inland flooding, and power outages. These storms are more frequent than hurricanes and can impact areas well inland, catching families off guard if they focus only on coastal hurricane warnings.

Tropical Storm Barry’s remnants triggered catastrophic flash flooding in Central Texas over the Fourth of July weekend, particularly in Kerr County. Torrential rains, up to 20 inches in some areas, sent the Guadalupe River surging as much as 29 feet in less than an hour, devastating summer camps like Camp Mystic and causing over 130 deaths and more than 100 people missing.

“This tragic event, far inland and unrelated to a hurricane, underscores how quickly remnants of tropical storms can become life-threatening,” said Dr. Eric Deussing, public health emergency officer for the Defense Health Agency. “Military families, especially those stationed inland, should stay alert for tropical systems even when a full hurricane isn’t forecasted.”

Military installations in the path of tropical storms and hurricanes are at risk to many of the same public health threats as our civilian neighbors, said Deussing.

“Clearly, natural disasters and their effects cross borders and federal fence-lines at will, he said. “These storms can also pose a wide range of public health threats that persist well beyond the initial impact.”

How these storms are classified

The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration defines a hurricane (https://oceanservice.noaa.gov/facts/hurricane.html) as a tropical cyclone with maximum sustained winds of 74 mph (64 knots) or higher. When a storm’s maximum sustained winds reach 74 mph, it is called a hurricane. The Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Wind Scale (https://www.nhc.noaa.gov/aboutsshws.php) is a 1 to 5 rating, or category, based on a hurricane’s maximum sustained winds. The higher the category, the greater the hurricane’s potential for property damage. For example, Hurricane Katrina (https://www.weather.gov/mob/katrina), which hit Louisiana and Mississippi in 2005, was a Category 5 storm causing an estimated $108 billion in damage and 1,833 fatalities.

A tropical storm is a type of tropical cyclone with maximum sustained winds ranging from 39 to 73 mph. While not as intense as hurricanes, tropical storms can lead to widespread flooding, downed trees, infrastructure damage, and disruption of military operations, said Deussing. In fact, many tropical storms quickly intensify and become hurricanes with little notice, making early preparation essential.

According to Ready.gov (https://www.ready.gov/hurricanes), the regional hurricane threats fall into three geographic areas:

Atlantic Basin: This region includes the Atlantic Ocean, the Caribbean Sea, and the Gulf of America. Hurricanes that form here primarily affect the coasts of the United States, including the Gulf Coast and East Coast, as well as territories such as Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands. The Atlantic hurricane season runs from June 1 to Nov. 30.

Eastern Pacific Basin: This area extends westward from Mexico and Central America to 140°W longitude. Hurricanes and tropical storms in this basin can affect Mexico and Central America, and occasionally the southwestern U.S. and Hawaii. The Eastern Pacific hurricane season runs from May 15 to Nov. 30.

Central Pacific Basin: This region covers the Pacific Ocean westward from 140°W longitude up to the International Date Line. Tropical cyclones in this basin, which are called hurricanes like those in the Atlantic and Eastern Pacific, can affect Hawaii and other islands in the central Pacific. The Central Pacific hurricane season is June 1 to Nov. 30.

Understanding your risk

Don’t underestimate any storms just because they fall below hurricane strength, said Deussing. Tropical storms have caused billions of dollars in damage and dozens of fatalities. Their unpredictable paths and potential to strengthen rapidly make them a serious risk as well.

Staying informed is one of the best ways to both plan and prepare for these weather emergencies. There are a number of excellent information sources to help you prepare. Military OneSource (https://www.militaryonesource.mil/resources/millife-guides/home-disaster-planning/) notes hurricane news and information may be provided through the Emergency Alert System. This system, along with news and government agency social media sites, can provide information about what to do, where to go and how to contact local disaster relief services.

In addition, your installation may choose to activate an Emergency Family Assistance Center. An EFAC provides a central hub for the dissemination of accurate and timely information and also connects victims to support and resources. To learn more about EFAC, contact your Military and Family Support Center (https://installations.militaryonesource.mil/search?program-service=26/view-by=ALL).

Preparing before the storm

Proactive preparation is key to ensuring your family’s safety and minimizing potential damage. Defense.gov (https://www.defense.gov/Spotlights/Hurricane-Preparedness/) and weather.gov offer these top tips for hurricane and tropical storm preparedness:

Hurricanes are not just a coastal problem. Find out how rain, wind, and water could happen where you live so you can start preparing.

Treat tropical storms with the same urgency as hurricanes. High winds, flash flooding, and power outages can occur even in weaker storms. Don’t wait for a Category 1 or higher designation to take action. Even dissipating tropical storms, like Tropical Storm Barry in early July 2025, brought flash floods and deadly river surges over 100 miles inland. Don’t dismiss a “remnant system”—it can cause major flooding without hurricane-force winds.

Have enough supplies for your household, including medication, disinfectant supplies, cloth-face coverings and pet supplies in your go bag or car trunk.

If you or anyone in your household has a disability, identify whether you may need additional help during an emergency.

You may have to evacuate quickly due to a hurricane, so know your local evacuation zone.

Download the FEMA app (https://www.fema.gov/about/news-multimedia/mobile-products) and receive real-time alerts from the National Weather Service for up to five locations nationwide.

Review your insurance policies and make sure personal documents, like identification, are up to date.

Discuss your hurricane emergency plan with members of your household.

Prepare your business or workplace with a continuity plan to continue operating when disaster strikes.

“Before the storm, individuals can prepare for public health threats by stocking up on clean water (1 gallon/person/day for three–seven days), creating a health and hygiene kit (hand sanitizer, insect repellant, soap, bleach, gloves, masks, and toilet supplies), and getting vaccinated for potential exposures to tetanus, flu, or hepatitis A/B,” said Deussing.

Following a hurricane

Public health threats following a hurricane broadly include vector-borne diseases (https://ph.health.mil/topics/entomology/vbd/Pages/default.aspx), water-borne diseases (https://www.cdc.gov/healthy-water-data/waterborne-disease-in-us/index.html), and mold (https://ph.health.mil/topics/workplacehealth/ih/Pages/Indoor-Air-Quality-Mold.aspx) exposure, said Deussing. Additionally, there can be environmental and hazardous waste exposures which can result in further health risks.

Tropical storms, especially those that stall, also carry similar public health risks, said Deussing.

“The Central Texas floods following Tropical Storm Barry’s remnants illustrate a second wave of public health risks,” said Deussing. “Floodwaters can persist for days, raising contamination, waterborne disease risk, and prompting mold growth and vector breeding, and all without a Category 1 warning.”

Defense.gov offers this advice for the immediate aftermath of a hurricane:

If you evacuated, return home only when officials say it is safe.

Once home, drive only if necessary, and avoid flooded roads and washed-out bridges. If you must go out, watch for fallen objects in the road, downed electrical wires, and weakened walls, bridges, roads, and sidewalks that might collapse.

Walk carefully around the outside of your home to check for loose power lines, gas leaks, and structural damage. Stay out of any building if you smell gas, if floodwaters remain around the building, if the building or home was damaged by fire, or if the authorities have not declared it safe.

Carbon monoxide poisoning is one of the leading causes of death after storms in areas dealing with power outages. Never use a portable generator inside your home or garage.

Turn on your flashlight before entering a vacated building; the battery could produce a spark that could ignite leaking gas, if present.

Hurricane season can be a stressful time, but by taking the necessary precautions and preparing in advance, service members and their families can reduce their risk significantly and stay safe. Stay informed, stay prepared, and stay safe!

The request “constitutes yet another abusive maneuver” by Equatorial Guinea, France’s agent, Diégo Colas, told the court.
In 2020, the international court ruled that the building was a private residence, not a diplomatic outpost, rejecting a claim from Equatorial Guinea that the seizure violated international law.
Equatorial Guinea returned to The Hague in 2022, arguing the French government was obliged to return the assets based on a U.N. anti-corruption convention.
Despite its oil and gas riches, Equatorial Guinea has a dramatic gap between its privileged ruling class and much of the impoverished population.","THE HAGUE, Netherlands (AP) — Lawyers for Equatorial Guinea accused France of “neo-colonial” behavior on Tuesday, urging United Nations judges to block the sale of a mansion on one of Paris’ poshest avenues in the latest instalment in a long-running legal tug-of-war over the multimillion-dollar property.

The African country filed a case at the International Court of Justice in 2022, alleging France is violating international law by refusing to return assets seized during a corruption investigation into Teodoro Nguema Obiang Mangue, the son of Equatorial Guinea’s long-serving president.

France’s approach “may be described as paternalistic and even neo-colonial. We cannot accept such disdain for our sovereignty from France,” Carmelo Nvono-Ncá, Equatorial Guinea’s agent, told The Hague-based court.

Equatorial Guinea has asked the court for a series of urgent orders, known as provisional measures, to return the swanky mansion on one of Paris’s most prestigious streets, Avenue Foch, and to prevent France from selling the building.

Lawyers for France strongly rejected the need for provisional measures, telling judges no sale was imminent and the dispute should be resolved via negotiation. The request “constitutes yet another abusive maneuver” by Equatorial Guinea, France’s agent, Diégo Colas, told the court.

In 2020, the international court ruled that the building was a private residence, not a diplomatic outpost, rejecting a claim from Equatorial Guinea that the seizure violated international law.

Obiang was convicted in 2017, and given a three-year suspended sentence for embezzling millions of dollars in public money. French authorities seized money, luxury vehicles and the building, which boasts a hammam, a cinema and a night club.

The 57-year-old has faced scrutiny for corruption in other countries as well. In 2021, he was sanctioned by the United Kingdom for misappropriating public funds, including spending $275,000 on the bejeweled glove that Michael Jackson wore on his “Bad” tour. Switzerland and Brazil have also opened investigations into his finances.

Equatorial Guinea returned to The Hague in 2022, arguing the French government was obliged to return the assets based on a U.N. anti-corruption convention.

Despite its oil and gas riches, Equatorial Guinea has a dramatic gap between its privileged ruling class and much of the impoverished population. The former Spanish colony is run by Africa’s longest-serving president, Obiang’s father Teodoro Obiang Nguema Mbasogo.
