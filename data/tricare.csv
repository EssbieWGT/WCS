If you have a contraindication like an interaction with another medicine- then the doctor can discuss is in the form and it shouldn’t be an issue.
I took ONE dose- had the most horrible reactions (racing heart, dizziness, irritability, etc etc) from ONE dose I told them not taking it again.
Not that you should have to endure a possible horrible reaction to get approved… but it’s how mine was approved.
So, a fairly unique circumstance, but ultimately they approved me for it without having to take the oral meds.","It’s all up to how the PA is filled out by your doctor. Express Scripts is super nice and helpful and I talked them extensively during my PA process because my doctors office kept filling out the forms wrong 😡😡. Bring the form into your doctor and discuss in person if you can, have them fill it out in front you and ask for a copy too. If you have a contraindication like an interaction with another medicine- then the doctor can discuss is in the form and it shouldn’t be an issue.

Side note- I used to be on antidepressants and anti anxiety’s a long time ago, but stopped taking them after I had kids (no good reason not to restart other than I was being stubborn). I’ve struggled for years off my meds, and Zep has made me feel new again. True happiness I haven’t felt in a long time. I’m not as irritable. Not as sad. More good days ❤️ Good luck with your journey!

Also- just in case…. I technically had contraindications to Qsymia/phentermine and was super adamant about not trying it. I went to an obesity specialist, who was not very kind and literally wanted to hear nothing about my contraindications concerns, and adamantly prescribed me Phentermine. I took ONE dose- had the most horrible reactions (racing heart, dizziness, irritability, etc etc) from ONE dose I told them not taking it again. I went back to my other doctor and told them my reactions. That counted as me trying and failing it for the sake of the form and my Zep PA was approved no problem after that. Not that you should have to endure a possible horrible reaction to get approved… but it’s how mine was approved.

I have TriCare as well and was able to get a PA without trying phentermine or the others. I had just worked with med management to get my adhd and anxiety under control for about a year and am on a stimulant, so i expressed my desires to my PCM that I didn’t want to get off of it because I was finally starting to feel good (you can’t take phentermine while on other stimulants). I also have a history of seizures, so I can’t take the other 2. So, a fairly unique circumstance, but ultimately they approved me for it without having to take the oral meds.

I have Tricare for life so I’m a bit older than you are and it was not a hard process at all. I know that the regulation state that you have to try three medication’s prior to going on Zepbound, but since my doctor had known me for the last 20 years and knew what I had been going through, he just zipped right through it and said I tried them all failed them and needed to go on Zepbound.Not sure if your doctor will do this for you or not but if you have to go through the steps, then do it. As far as your mother saying that it is a risky medicine, as a nurse I can tell you that all medications can be risky. But GLP ones have been out for over 20 years and the science is there to back it up. Now some people are going to get side effects, some get it real bad, and others don’t have a problem whatsoever. I was one of the lucky ones that had side effects from day one and I am now starting my 16th month and I still have nausea most days. But I look at it this way. The medication is working therefore I have side effects. I would worry if I didn’t have side effects but that’s just me. You can tell your mom what good this drug does, though for people. I no longer have to take blood pressure medicine, cholesterol medicine, thyroid medicine, and I’m off of two of my atrial fib medication’s. I no longer am prediabetic, I no longer have sleep apnea either. I’m no longer at risk for 14 types of cancer that obese people get. I can run up and down the stairs after my granddaughters. I can walk across the room now without being short of breath. after 15 months on this miracle drug, I have lost 91 pounds. I am still considered overweight by another 15 pounds but that’s OK with me. Do I really wanna get back to what I was when I was 22 years old? I like who I am now in this body. I went from a size 22/24 to now a size 12. i’m not in maintenance yet as I would like to continue trying to lose some more weight. We are going on a cruise in a month and we’ll see what happens on that cruise. I am happy to say that my food noise is still being controlled and I have to remind myself sometimes to eat. But hunger is a good thing. now I find myself saying hey I’m hungry. I’m gonna try to eat this. And I may only eat half of it and again that’s OK. I’m sorry you don’t have a support of your mom that can be tough. I have a loving husband and two sons and three grandchildren that are cheering me on daily. Now my granddaughter did ask me if everything‘s going to change about me because she’s seen the change over the last 15 months. I told her that my heart will never change for her just the fat around it. I wish you the best of luck on this journey. Should you decide to take it. It is life-changing in so many aspects. Keep coming back here to this forum to be inspired by us. Who knows next year you may be the one giving advice to people. Blessings to you sweetheart.

As NBC reports, Tricare - a lifelong benefit promised to many who serve, but one that has been plagued by widespread disruptions to service members, their families and the physicians who accept the insurance following a change in contracts.

Women across the country are speaking out about delays and denials of basic maternity because of improperly working Tricare.

NBC News collected numerous stories.

In Kansas City, at least two medical providers were telling Audrey Simmons they couldn’t see her because of ongoing negotiations with her insurance, leaving her with limited options during her high-risk pregnancy.

Then she found out that many others were in the same situation.

Marine Corps Sgt. Savannah Harper, 27, had trouble getting prenatal care in January after she transferred from a California base to one in Hawaii. She repeatedly called Tricare for help, enduring wait times of up to 90 minutes with no resolution - all leading to a full month overdue for her 20-week ultrasound.

Another issue is Tricare demanding repayment of previously paid claims. In Nevada, a Navy veteran and his wife said Tricare had rescinded over $100,000 in medical claims it had approved and paid years ago, NBC reports.

The result of Tricare so far: Missed diagnoses, confusion, stress, and unnecessary financial burdens. Our service members and veterans deserve better.

We call on the Defense Health Agency to fix Tricare coverage immediately. Ensure military families get timely, standard care without bureaucratic red tape.

Stop letting down the very people who served this country.

Top 10 Nutrition Habits to be a Readiness CHAMP: 1.
Know Your Why The most important step in changing your nutrition habits is to clearly understand why you want that behavior to change.
CHAMP’s Strategic Habits for Better Nutrition worksheet helps guide you to optimal nutrition goals—and it includes how to stay motivated and committed in changing your habits.
• Identify the nutrition habits you want to focus on.","The Consortium for Health and Military Performance at the University of Uniformed Services, otherwise known as CHAMP, provides human performance resources for warfighters to maintain an optimal healthy lifestyle.

CHAMP features ways to achieve optimal readiness through a combination of psychological, social, nutritional, spiritual, and physical fitness tools—including a focus on one area that plays a critical connection between food and readiness: nutrition, which can have many benefits on mission readiness for service members and their families.

""We now know that body strength, weight, and overall functioning are the result of biological, psychological, and environmental factors,” said Dr. Marian Tanofsky-Kraff, director of Developmental Research Laboratory on Eating & Weight Behaviors for USU. “Good nutrition and physical activity can supplement physical and emotional health.""

Nutrition is vital to mission readiness. Food provides the human body with the continuous supply of energy it needs to function efficiently. This demand increases significantly when engaging in physical activities, whether for recreational, competitive, or duty purposes.

As one of the most important drivers of optimal physical and psychological wellbeing, “proper nutrition gives your brain the nutrients it needs to manage stress, regulate mood and emotions, maintain alertness and optimize physical and cognitive performance—all essential components of mission readiness,” according to military health experts. “Eating healthy keeps you sharp mentally and fueled physically. This is especially important when facing increased stress or high operational tempo.”

The CHAMP site maintains dozens of resources on nutrition basics and specialty topics to enhance warfighter performance during workouts, training, missions, and recovery.

Top 10 Nutrition Habits to be a Readiness CHAMP:

1. Know Your Why

The most important step in changing your nutrition habits is to clearly understand why you want that behavior to change.

CHAMP’s Strategic Habits for Better Nutrition worksheet helps guide you to optimal nutrition goals—and it includes how to stay motivated and committed in changing your habits. The form contains questions to assess your current nutritional intake, organized in three steps:

• Identify the “why” behind the behavior you want to change.

• Identify the nutrition habits you want to focus on. As your habits evolve and improve, revisit the worksheet to choose new habits to work on.

• Create your strategy. The worksheet contains ways to develop habits to promote nutritional fitness.

2. Value Whole Foods

Focus on whole foods, and fewer processed foods. Choose more plants, the more colors the better for foods with naturally occurring nutrients.

For more on plant-forward eating, and to view sample menus and food swaps see CHAMP’s Go for Green Power Your Menu with Plants toolkit.

3. Time Meals

Follow a regular eating pattern and plan your nutrition strategy ahead of time. Avoid skipping meals or going too long without eating. Fuel before, during, and after exercise.

4. Understand Macronutrients

Energy primarily comes from three macronutrients, and each plays a distinct role in sustaining performance and aiding recovery. Aim to get a balance of these nutrients each day.

The three main macronutrients are:

• Carbohydrates: The body's main energy source, carbohydrates break down into sugars to provide immediate energy. Complex carbohydrates—as opposed to simple carbs in candy, soda, fruit juice, or sports drinks—are preferred as they are digested slowly and release steady supply of energy. They are found in whole-grains, beans, starchy vegetables, and fresh fruit. If you’re eating bread, cereal, tortillas, or pasta, whole-grain options are much healthier.

• Fats: Essential for a balanced diet, fats supply fat-soluble vitamins (A, D, E, and K), which are important for performance and recovery. Examples of fats include avocado, butter, and olive oil.

• Proteins: Found in every cell, protein is crucial for muscle repair and recovery. Sources of protein include chicken, lean beef, low-fat milk, and Greek yogurt.

5. Appreciate Omega-3

Omega-3 fatty acids support the health of your heart and blood vessels, nerves, eyes, brain, and immune system and may improve physical and mental performance. For example, omega-3s are being studied for the positive effects they might have in recovery from exercise and injury, as well as their role in protecting the brain and nervous system after a concussion or traumatic brain injury.

Find out which foods are highest in Omega-3 Content and how much you need from CHAMP.

6. Create Power Plates

CHAMP recommends a power plate guide to meet the nutritional requirements of the unique occupational and training demands of service members.

Power Plate Guide recommendations include:

• Make one-fourth of your plate lean protein.

• Make one-fourth to one-half of your plate natural and whole-grain carbohydrates.

• Aim for one-fourth to one-half of your plate to be non-starchy vegetables.

• Aim for one thumb-size portion of unsaturated fat.

• Stay hydrated.

• Eat mindfully.

7. Calculate Hydration

Water is the most abundant component of the human body—around 50–70% of its weight—so your body requires fluids regularly to ensure its normal function.

Given the unique nutritional requirements of Warfighters, the general fluid guidelines in the military are:

• Men: 96–144 oz daily (12–18 cups)

• Women: 64–96 oz daily (8–12 cups)

For more about daily fluid guidelines and how to tell if you’re at risk of dehydration see CHAMP’s Basic Hydration Strategies article.

8. Know What to Limit

The relationship between nutrition and mental health has grown in recent years. Studies show that certain foods may be used to prevent and treat conditions like depression.

Foods that cause inflammation and disrupt your “gut microbiota” may impact your mental well-being.

To get smart on what foods to limit or avoid and what foods to eat more of, see CHAMP’s Food and Mood: Does diet affect depression? article.

9. Choose More Plants

The benefits of vegetarian diets are linked to a lower risk of many chronic diseases, including heart disease, diabetes, and cancer.

To learn about the benefits of vegetarian diets and how to make sure you still get the right amount of key nutrients your body needs while on active duty, read CHAMP’s What you need to know about vegetarian diets article.

10. Track Food Intake

Knowing what you consume and how much you eat each day is a simple way to take charge of your eating habits. Consider starting a food journal or using food-diary apps to monitor your daily diet and improve your nutrition.

Several free apps are available like USDA’s MyPlate App.

While most of these cases are in Texas and New Mexico, cases have been rising across the country.

Anyone who isn’t protected against measles can get the illness—and children are especially at risk of getting seriously sick. You may be wondering how to keep your family safe.

“Measles is more than just a rash; it can lead to severe illness, and it’s extremely contagious—you can catch it just from being in the same room as an infected person,” explained Dr. Eric Deussing, Public Health Emergency Officer for the Defense Health Agency. “So, it’s important to take steps to keep you and your loved ones protected and learn how to recognize potential symptoms. Two doses of the measles, mumps, and rubella, or MMR, vaccine provide the best protection against measles.”

Here’s what you need to know.

What is measles?

Measles is a highly contagious illness that can cause serious complications. It spreads through the air when an infected person coughs or sneezes—sometimes, this happens up to four days before they’re even showing symptoms.

People of any age can get serious cases of measles. But the following groups are at increased risk for complications:

Children younger than age 5

Adults older than age 20

Pregnant women

People with weakened immune systems

Recognizing measles signs and symptoms

Measles symptoms usually appear between seven and 14 days after infection.

Initial symptoms typically include:

High fever (sometimes above 104 degrees)

Cough

Runny nose

Red, watery eyes

Two to three days after the start of symptoms, you may see tiny white spots (Koplik spots) in your mouth.

In three to five days, you may develop the measles rash—flat red spots that usually start on the face, and then spread down the body towards the feet.

Common complications of measles are ear infections and diarrhea. More severe complications can include pneumonia, swelling of the brain, and other conditions that can lead to hospitalization.

Are you or a family member showing signs of measles? Call the Military Health System Nurse Advice Line at 800-TRICARE (874-2273). Describe your symptoms to a registered nurse, who can advise you on what to do next.

Preventing measles

Your best defense against measles is getting vaccinated. Most people who got their vaccination have protection against measles for life, as described by the CDC.

The measles, mumps, and rubella, or MMR, vaccine protects against measles as well as mumps and rubella. This vaccine is available to those older than 12 months old.

The measles, mumps, rubella, and varicella, or MMRV, vaccine protects against these illnesses as well as chickenpox. This vaccine is only available to children 12 months old through 12 years old.

Both the MMR and MMRV vaccines are administered in two doses. Children under age 12 should get the first dose between 12 and 15 months old, and the second between 4 and 6 years old. (Children may also get the MMRV second dose three months after the first dose.)

Older children, teenagers, and adults should get one or two doses of the MMR vaccine if they don’t have evidence of immunity. (Note: You’re considered immune if you were born before 1957, since it’s likely you were infected naturally.) Doses should be given at least 28 days apart.

TRICARE covers age-appropriate doses of these vaccines, as recommended by the CDC. You don’t need a referral or other approval to get these vaccines. As described in the TRICARE Pharmacy Program Handbook, you can get these vaccines at no cost, as long as you:

Go to a military hospital or clinic.

Go to a TRICARE retail network pharmacy. Make sure the person who gives you the vaccine is a pharmacist. If another type of provider gives you a vaccine at a retail pharmacy, you may have out-of-pocket costs.

See a TRICARE-authorized civilian provider. However, if you get other services at the same time, you may have to pay copayments or cost-shares. These costs vary based on your health plan.

If you live overseas, you can get vaccinated at your local military hospital or clinic or by a TRICARE-authorized civilian provider.

Do you have more questions about the measles or getting an MMR or MMRV vaccine for yourself or your child? Talk to your healthcare provider or contact the MHS Nurse Advice Line.",https://dha.mil/-/media/Project/Images/News-Images/measles.png,N,0.0,2025-04-18 21:56:27.507781

Gibson said, “It’s an honor to serve our beneficiaries, and we strive to provide them with world-class health care service.”","Defense Health Agency military medical laboratory professionals play a crucial role in supporting warfighter readiness, said U.S. Navy Lt. Cmdr. Clara Pangco, laboratory department head at Naval Hospital Twentynine Palms in Twentynine Palms, California.

She is one of hundreds of military lab professionals who offer critical services and vital information to service members and families. “Lab teams are part of patients’ health care teams and assist providers in making clinical decisions,” said Pangco.

“We provide relevant information to help treat and diagnose,” she said. “From a warfighting readiness standpoint—we ensure service members are ready to deploy and can meet the demands of combat operations.”

It’s fulfilling and rewarding work, noted Pangco. “I love everything about laboratory science and its management, as we get to play scientists, investigators, and problem solvers every day,” she said, noting that their work is often behind the scenes.

“The laboratory result a patient or provider sees is but a small percentage of the work we do,” Pangco continued. “Day in and day out, we make sure the result is always accurate and reliable by ensuring we adhere to strict quality assurance requirements such as equipment maintenance, calibration, and quality control.”

Like the Twentynine Palms team, warfighter readiness is a priority for the lab team at Yokota Air Base in Tokyo, according to U.S. Air Force Lt. Col. Cordy Herring, Yokota Air Base lab officer. “All service members have Individual Medical Readiness requirements, which include specific immunizations, physical examinations, and medical evaluations,” he said. “The lab collects, tests, and ships samples for IMR testing to ensure people are medically ready for deployment. “We also run several programs contributing to readiness,” said Herring, “including a frozen blood program, an expeditionary blood program, a laboratory biological defense team, and a walking blood bank team.”

In addition, the Yokota Air Base lab team supports clinical operations. “The team examines tissues and bodily fluids and provides information to clinical teams to help determine overall health and treatment plans for our patients,” explained Herring. “We also provide blood products for hemorrhaging patients to save lives.”

The team collects forensic samples for alcohol-related incidents, aircraft mishaps, and also sends samples to assist with Department of Defense investigation processes. “We are always striving for continuous improvement,” Herring added.

These improvement efforts were showcased during a recent visit from the Air Force Blood Program and the Food and Drug Administration. “The visit resulted in the lab being named as one of the best within Japan’s DOD military hospitals and clinics,” said Herring. “The FDA was very impressed. We received a flawless inspection, acknowledging our safe blood practices and our commitment to care.”

Preventing Disease and the Spread of Infection

Lab professionals also help conserve service member strength by working to prevent disease and infection, said William Gibson, supervisory microbiologist at Madigan Army Medical Center at Joint Base Lewis-McChord, Washington. “Our lab tests over 100,000 specimens per year from beneficiaries on the West Coast, including Alaska, to the Midwest,” said Gibson. “The microbiology laboratory’s scope includes bacteriology, immunology, molecular microbiology, mycology, and blood parasitology. “We are currently working on several projects including cervical cancer screening through HPV testing,” he continued.

“We started HPV primary screening on April 7, 2025—this is a national guideline supported practice that is both workflow optimization and fiscally efficient,” said Gibson. “This summer, we intend to offer HPV self-collection testing, which has the potential to increase access to care.”

Communicable disease reporting is another ongoing project. “Infections are a fact of life. Everyone will be personally impacted by one throughout their lifespan,” he said. “Our active duty force travels the global and are exposed to a myriad of pathogens in which we must be able to provide education for prevention, prophylactics, diagnostics, and treatment for the world’s diseases. “We are looking to make sure that the reporting systems used to trace certain infections contain all the applicable test results across the DHA enterprise,” said Gibson. “This helps ensure the DHA, especially Epidemiology and Infection Control staff, have accurate data to react to things like outbreaks and facilitate an operational picture regarding medical intelligence.”

Delivering for Beneficiaries

Herring said the lab is needed. “Whether taking care of our patients, consoling a child when they are crying about getting blood collected, providing information to commanders to make decisions on careers, detecting possible biowarfare agents, or ensuring we can take care of our populace with blood programs—the lab is involved in operations,” he said.

This is all made possible through teamwork. “The team works hard together,” said Herring. “They excel in all duties and leave programs better than they found it. We take care of each other, support each other through the stressful times, and celebrate our wins. We’re proud of how much we have grown, how much we have accomplished.”

Pangco had praise for the staff at Twentynine Palms. “I am blessed with a great team,” Pangco said. ""Our recent successful FDA and College of American Pathologists reinspection was a testament of their hard work and dedication. The inspectors expressed noteworthy commendations. It was an all-around team success."" Ultimately, caring for beneficiaries is at the heart of the work of every lab professional.

As a reminder, TRICARE beneficiaries, other than active duty service members, may receive urgent care from any TRICARE-authorized urgent care center or provider and do not need a referral. This allows beneficiaries to seek nonemergency care for illnesses or injuries if their primary care provider is unavailable because of emergencies.

New York, New York--(Newsfile Corp. - April 18, 2025) - Faruqi & Faruqi, LLP, a leading national securities law firm, is investigating potential claims against Zynex, Inc. (""Zynex"" or the ""Company"") (NASDAQ: ZYXI) and reminds investors of the May 19, 2025 deadline to seek the role of lead plaintiff in a federal securities class action that has been filed against the Company.

Faruqi & Faruqi is a leading national securities law firm with offices in New York, Pennsylvania, California and Georgia. The firm has recovered hundreds of millions of dollars for investors since its founding in 1995. See www.faruqilaw.com.

As detailed below, the complaint alleges that the Company and its executives violated federal securities laws by making false and/or misleading statements and/or failing to disclose: (1) that Zynex shipped products, including electrodes, in excess of need; (2) that, as a result of this practice, the Company inflated its revenue; (3) that the Company's practice of filing false claims drew scrutiny from insurers, including Tricare; (4) that, as a result, it was reasonably likely that Zynex would face adverse consequences, including removal from insurer networks and penalties from the federal government; and (5) that, as a result of the foregoing, Defendants' positive statements about the Company's business, operations, and prospects were materially misleading and/or lacked a reasonable basis.

On June 4, 2024, medical journal STAT published a report on Zynex entitled ""How a device maker inundated pain patients with unwanted batteries and surprise bills."" The report claimed Zynex engaged in an ""oversupplying scheme"" by sending inordinate amounts of monthly supplies like electrode pads and batteries in order to ""bill insurers for thousands of dollars more than it otherwise could."" The report further revealed that, as a result of this practice, insurers were ""kicking the company out of network.""

On this news, Zynex's stock price fell $0.50 per share, or 5%, to close at $9.35 per share on June 4, 2024, on unusually heavy trading volume.

On March 11, 2025, after the market closed, Zynex reported its fourth quarter and full year 2024 financial results, revealing a significant revenue ""shortfall"" in the quarter ""due to slower than normal payments from certain payers."" Zynex further revealed ""Tricare has temporarily suspended payments as they review prior claims."" Tricare is the health insurance program for the U.S. military.

On this news, Zynex's stock price fell $3.59 per share, or 51.3%, to close at $3.41 per share on March 12, 2025, on unusually heavy trading volume.

The court-appointed lead plaintiff is the investor with the largest financial interest in the relief sought by the class who is adequate and typical of class members who directs and oversees the litigation on behalf of the putative class. Any member of the putative class may move the Court to serve as lead plaintiff through counsel of their choice, or may choose to do nothing and remain an absent class member.

The Defense Health Agency (DHA) plays a crucial role in maintaining the readiness of the military by ensuring the health and well-being of service members. As a key component of the Department of Defense, the DHA is responsible for managing a comprehensive healthcare system that supports military operations both at home and abroad. This section will delve into the core functions of the DHA, highlighting its responsibilities in managing medical facilities, coordinating healthcare delivery, and supporting military operations globally. Understanding these roles is essential for optimizing DHA operations and enhancing military readiness.

Key Responsibilities of the DHA

The Defense Health Agency is tasked with a wide array of responsibilities essential to maintaining a healthy and combat-ready military force. These responsibilities include:

Medical Logistics: The DHA oversees the procurement and distribution of medical supplies and equipment, ensuring that all military medical facilities are well-equipped to handle the needs of service members. This includes everything from basic medical supplies to advanced surgical equipment.

Healthcare Policy Implementation: The agency is responsible for implementing healthcare policies that govern the delivery of medical services across military branches. This ensures uniformity and quality in healthcare delivery, regardless of location.

Medical Facility Management: Managing a network of medical facilities, the DHA ensures that service members have access to quality healthcare services. This includes hospitals, clinics, and specialized care centers located worldwide.

Support for Global Military Operations: The DHA provides medical support for military operations globally, ensuring that troops have access to necessary medical care during deployment. This involves coordinating with local healthcare providers and setting up field hospitals as needed.

In fulfilling these responsibilities, the DHA plays a pivotal role in maintaining the operational readiness of the armed forces. It ensures that all service members receive the necessary medical care to perform their duties effectively. For more on how the DHA enhances military readiness, visit our page on enhancing federal standards for military medical readiness.

The DHA’s partnerships with civilian healthcare providers and international agencies further enhance its ability to deliver quality care and respond to medical emergencies. These collaborations enable the agency to leverage external resources and expertise, ensuring that military personnel receive timely and effective medical treatment.

Moreover, the DHA is instrumental in bioterrorism preparedness and infectious disease response, areas critical to maintaining the health security of military forces. By coordinating with federal agencies and implementing robust health surveillance systems, the DHA can detect and respond to potential threats swiftly.

As the military continues to face evolving challenges, the DHA’s role in optimizing healthcare operations becomes increasingly significant. The agency’s efforts to integrate advanced medical technologies, streamline operations, and enhance interagency collaboration are vital to ensuring that the armed forces remain prepared for any eventuality. To learn more about the DHA’s role in modernizing military healthcare systems, visit our comprehensive overview.

In conclusion, the Defense Health Agency is a cornerstone of military readiness, providing essential medical services that ensure the health and efficiency of the armed forces. Its comprehensive approach to healthcare management, policy implementation, and global operational support underscores its critical role in maintaining the military’s combat readiness and overall effectiveness.

Strategies for Enhancing Military Medical Readiness

Optimizing the operations of the Defense Health Agency (DHA) involves implementing strategic measures to improve military medical readiness. The complexities of modern military operations demand innovative approaches to ensure that service members receive timely and effective medical care. This section delves into the various strategies employed by the DHA to enhance military medical readiness, focusing on advancements in medical technology, comprehensive training programs for medical personnel, and initiatives for rapid medical deployment.

Innovations in Military Healthcare

In recent years, the Defense Health Agency has been at the forefront of integrating cutting-edge technologies to bolster military healthcare capabilities. These innovations are pivotal in ensuring that military personnel are not only prepared for combat but also receive the best possible care in the event of injuries or illnesses.

Telemedicine: The advent of telemedicine has revolutionized the way healthcare is delivered to military personnel, especially those stationed in remote or hostile environments. Telemedicine allows healthcare providers to conduct virtual consultations, diagnose conditions, and even provide treatment advice without the need for physical presence. This approach not only saves time but also ensures that military personnel have access to medical expertise whenever and wherever needed. For more on how telemedicine is enhancing military healthcare, visit our page on enhancing military telehealth capabilities.

Mobile Medical Units: These units are essentially hospitals on wheels, equipped with state-of-the-art medical equipment and staffed by skilled medical professionals. Mobile medical units can be rapidly deployed to conflict zones or disaster-stricken areas, providing immediate medical care to those in need. The flexibility and mobility of these units make them invaluable assets in military operations.

Artificial Intelligence: AI is increasingly being used in medical diagnostics and treatment planning. By analyzing vast amounts of data, AI systems can identify patterns and predict outcomes with remarkable accuracy. This capability is particularly useful in the military context, where timely and accurate diagnosis can be the difference between life and death. AI-driven analytics are also instrumental in optimizing resource allocation and streamlining healthcare delivery processes. Discover more about AI’s role in military medical readiness at the role of AI in military medical readiness.

Comprehensive Training Programs

The effectiveness of any healthcare system is heavily reliant on the competence and preparedness of its personnel. The DHA recognizes this and has implemented comprehensive training programs aimed at equipping military medical staff with the skills and knowledge necessary to handle a wide range of medical scenarios.

Combat Medic Training: Combat medics are often the first responders in battlefield situations, and their ability to provide immediate care is crucial. The DHA has developed rigorous training programs that simulate real-world combat scenarios, allowing medics to hone their skills in a controlled environment. For more insights into combat medic training, explore our page on advancing military combat medic training.

Emergency Medical Response: In addition to combat-specific training, the DHA also focuses on broader emergency medical response training. This includes preparing medical personnel to respond to natural disasters, pandemics, and other large-scale emergencies. Such training ensures that military medical teams are versatile and can adapt to various situations.

Continuous Education and Certification: The medical field is constantly evolving, with new treatments and technologies emerging regularly. The DHA encourages continuous education and certification for its medical staff, ensuring they remain up-to-date with the latest advancements in healthcare.

Initiatives for Rapid Medical Deployment

In military operations, the ability to rapidly deploy medical resources can significantly impact the outcome of missions. The DHA has implemented several initiatives to ensure that medical teams and equipment can be swiftly mobilized when needed.

Pre-positioning of Medical Supplies: By strategically pre-positioning medical supplies in key locations around the world, the DHA can ensure that these resources are readily available in times of crisis. This reduces the time taken to deliver critical supplies to where they are most needed.

Interagency Collaboration: The DHA collaborates with other federal agencies and international partners to enhance its rapid deployment capabilities. By leveraging the strengths and resources of these partners, the DHA can respond more effectively to global health emergencies. Learn more about interagency collaboration in military medical response at improving federal coordination in military medical response.

Simulation Exercises: Regular simulation exercises are conducted to test and refine the DHA’s rapid deployment protocols. These exercises help identify potential bottlenecks and areas for improvement, ensuring that the DHA is always ready to respond at a moment’s notice.

Through these strategies, the Defense Health Agency is not only enhancing military medical readiness but also setting new standards for healthcare delivery in challenging and dynamic environments. By embracing innovation, investing in training, and fostering collaboration, the DHA is ensuring that military personnel receive the highest standard of care, no matter where they are deployed.

Challenges in Optimizing DHA Operations

The Defense Health Agency (DHA) is instrumental in maintaining military readiness, yet it faces numerous challenges in optimizing its operations. These challenges include budget constraints, logistical hurdles, and the need for effective interagency collaboration. Addressing these obstacles is crucial for enhancing the efficiency and effectiveness of DHA operations, ensuring that service members receive the care they need.

Addressing Logistical and Budgetary Constraints

Logistical and budgetary constraints significantly impact the DHA’s ability to provide comprehensive healthcare to military personnel. These constraints can lead to delays in medical supply delivery, limited access to cutting-edge medical technologies, and reduced training opportunities for medical staff.

Supply Chain Disruptions: The complexity of military logistics can cause disruptions that hinder timely access to essential medical supplies. Streamlining the supply chain and enhancing coordination with private sectors could mitigate these issues.

Budget Limitations: Budget constraints restrict the DHA’s ability to invest in advanced medical technologies and infrastructure. Exploring federal investments in medical readiness infrastructure could alleviate some of these financial pressures.

Resource Allocation: Efficient resource allocation is essential for maximizing the use of available funds. Implementing strategic planning and prioritizing critical areas of need can optimize the use of limited resources.

Overcoming these constraints requires innovative strategies and partnerships. For instance, leveraging partnerships with private healthcare providers can enhance resource availability and improve service delivery. Additionally, the DHA could benefit from optimizing resource allocation strategies to ensure that funds are directed towards areas of greatest need, such as expanding training programs for emergency situations.

Addressing these challenges is not just about maintaining the status quo; it’s about enhancing the DHA’s capabilities to respond swiftly and effectively to the dynamic needs of military operations. By focusing on overcoming logistical and budgetary hurdles, the DHA can better support the health and readiness of service members, ensuring they are equipped to face any challenge.

Moreover, strengthening logistics for combat readiness and improving coordination with other federal agencies can further enhance the DHA’s operational efficiency. By fostering collaboration and innovation, the DHA can develop robust solutions that ensure sustained military readiness and optimal healthcare outcomes.

As the DHA continues to navigate these challenges, it remains committed to its mission of providing comprehensive healthcare services to military personnel. By implementing strategic solutions and fostering partnerships, the DHA can overcome these obstacles and enhance its operations, ensuring that service members receive the care they deserve.

Future Directions for the Defense Health Agency

As the Defense Health Agency (DHA) continues to evolve, it must anticipate and adapt to the dynamic needs of military operations. This forward-thinking approach involves developing new healthcare delivery models, emphasizing preventive care, and expanding mental health services for military personnel. By focusing on these future directions, the DHA aims to enhance its operations and ensure sustained military readiness. Let’s delve into these promising avenues that are set to redefine military healthcare.

Expanding Preventive and Mental Health Services

Preventive care and mental health services are crucial components of a comprehensive healthcare strategy. The DHA is committed to expanding these services, recognizing their role in enhancing the overall well-being and resilience of service members. By prioritizing preventive measures, such as regular health screenings and wellness programs, the DHA can identify and address potential health issues before they escalate. This proactive approach not only improves individual health outcomes but also contributes to a more robust and ready military force.

In addition, the importance of mental health cannot be overstated. The stresses of military life can take a significant toll on mental well-being, making it imperative for the DHA to offer accessible and effective mental health services. Initiatives aimed at reducing stigma and providing comprehensive support for mental health challenges are essential for fostering a supportive environment for service members. By expanding mental health services, the DHA ensures that military personnel have the resources they need to maintain mental resilience and readiness.

Looking ahead, the DHA’s commitment to expanding military access to healthcare under federal policy will play a pivotal role in ensuring that service members receive the support they need. By embracing these future directions, the DHA is poised to enhance its operations and maintain military readiness in an ever-changing landscape.

These include Beneficiary Counseling and Assistance Coordinators. You can find them at any military hospital or clinic.

Before you reach out to a BCAC, it’s important to first contact your regional contractor for help with TRICARE issues. Most TRICARE questions and concerns—such as those about enrollment, claims, referrals, or provider networks—can be handled directly through them. If you've already reached out to your contractor and still need help, a BCAC is your next step. They can take a deeper look at your issue and help guide you toward a resolution.

To get help, start by contacting the appropriate resource:

Questions about TRICARE eligibility or updates to a military service record: Contact your Service Personnel Component or the DMDC/DEERS Support Office (800-538-9552).

Questions about enrollment, claims, provider networks, or referrals: Contact your regional contractor first.

So, when should you get in touch with a BCAC? Read below to learn more.

What does a Beneficiary Counseling and Assistance Coordinator do?

BCACs can explain your TRICARE plan and how your benefit works. They work closely with regional contractors and claims processors to help resolve your concerns.

BCACs can address TRICARE-related questions, including:

Enrollment

Referrals and pre-authorizations

Claims processing delays

Covered services

The Military Health System Nurse Advice Line

Getting healthcare services outside the military hospital or clinic

“You may have questions or concerns about TRICARE enrollment, coverage, or costs that haven’t been resolved through traditional channels. BCACs are people you can contact, and even meet with in person,” said Calvin Keller, health systems analyst, Benefit Education, at the Defense Health Agency. “They’re committed to answering your questions and addressing your concerns.”

For example, you may have a question about your TRICARE eligibility or enrollment as shown in the Defense Enrollment Eligibility Reporting System. Maybe your record shows “No healthcare coverage plan” and you believe this is an error. After reaching out to the DMDC/DEERS Support Office, a BCAC can:

Explain the different messages you see in your DEERS record

Provide information on eligibility requirements

Guide you on how to follow up with your sponsor’s Service Personnel Component

BCACs don’t determine or fix TRICARE eligibility—but they can be a valuable resource in navigating the process.

Why reach out to a BCAC?

If you feel lost after trying to resolve issues with your regional contractor or service, there are still other TRICARE experts who can help. Consider reaching out to a BCAC. BCACs will work with you to understand your concerns and explore possible solutions.

Who can get help from a BCAC?

Do you still have questions after contacting your regional contractor? Any TRICARE beneficiary can visit or call a BCAC, even if you don’t regularly get care at a military hospital or clinic, or live far from one.

How do I find a BCAC?

You can meet with a BCAC in person by walking into their office. You don’t need an appointment. If you can’t get there in person, you can give them a call.

Each military hospital or clinic has contact information for their BCAC. Find their information online on the Find a Military Hospital or Clinic page. Or check out the Customer Service Community Directory. You can also ask the hospital staff for their office location if you’d like to meet in person.

What’s the difference between a BCAC and a patient advocate?

While both are there to support you, BCACs and patient advocates have different roles. BCACs help with TRICARE benefits. Patient advocates help with concerns or questions about healthcare services you received at a military hospital or clinic.

They can:

Explain the Patient Bill of Rights and Responsibilities and give you a copy

Explain military hospital or clinic policies, procedures, and operations

Mediate concerns between you and your medical team

At right is John Vinson, CEO of the Arkansas Pharmacists Association, who also supported the policy. (Tess Vrbin/Arkansas Advocate)

Arkansas became the first state in the nation to prevent healthcare conglomerates from operating drugstores here when Gov. Sarah Huckabee Sanders signed House Bill 1150 on Wednesday.

State law already regulates what pharmacy benefit managers (PBMs) pay to reimburse independent pharmacies, but pharmacists have complained that the companies violate the law. The state has also fined four PBMs a total of $1.47 million for paying Arkansas pharmacies below the legally required amount for prescription drugs.

PBMs negotiate prescription benefits among drug manufacturers, distributors, pharmacies and health insurance providers, and the biggest ones also own pharmacies and insurers. The Federal Trade Commission released an interim report in July 2024 saying these conglomerates are eliminating competition and increasing drug prices at the expense of patients.

HB 1150 headed to Sanders’ desk April 9 after clearing the Senate with a bipartisan 26 votes, six days after it passed the House with 89 votes. The bill generated hours of discussion and public comment in the House and Senate committees on Insurance and Commerce this month.

“These massive corporations are attacking our state because we will be the first in the country to hold them accountable for their anticompetitive actions,” Sanders said in a statement Wednesday.

CVS Health issued a statement last week urging Sanders to veto HB 1150, calling it “misguided policy.” The organization, which includes the CVS Caremark PBM, issued another statement Wednesday afternoon.

“CVS Health welcomes a good faith discussion with policy makers in Arkansas and across the country on ways to make medicine more affordable and accessible,” the statement said. “Unfortunately, HB1150 is bad policy that accomplishes just the opposite: it will take away access to pharmacy care in local communities, hike prescription drug spending across the state by millions of dollars each year, and cost hundreds of Arkansans their jobs.”

Arkansas has 23 CVS pharmacies that CVS and other opponents of HB 1150 said will be forced to close under the new law. Arkansas Pharmacists Association CEO John Vinson said this is not true and pharmacies can still operate if they detach from PBMs.

Sanders, Vinson and other supporters of HB 1150 have said a lack of sufficient regulation of PBMs has allowed them to monopolize the pharmaceutical industry by setting their competitors’ prices.

OptumRX, Express Scripts and CVS Caremark – the three largest PBMs – are each owned by much larger corporations that each also own a top-10 health insurer. Together they control about 80% of the U.S. prescription market, according to last year’s Federal Trade Commission report.

The legal landscape

Act 1 and Act 3 of 2018 prohibit PBMs from reimbursing their affiliated pharmacies in Arkansas at a higher rate than their competitors, locally owned independent pharmacies. PBMs routinely break these laws, said Vinson and HB 1150’s Republican sponsors, Sen. Kim Hammer of Benton and Rep. Jeremiah Moore of Clarendon.

PBMs have allegedly also violated Act 900 of 2015, which required PBMs to pay pharmacies at least as much as the national average of what drugstores pay wholesalers for drugs. Pharmacies sent the Arkansas Insurance Department (AID) thousands of complaints in 2024, claiming PBMs either illegally paid them below this national average or paid them at or just above this amount, independent pharmacists and AID’s general counsel told lawmakers last year.

This led the Arkansas Legislative Council to require PBMs to include dispensing fees in their reimbursements for prescription drugs. The panel approved the rule a day after its Administrative Rules subcommittee rejected it.

Hammer told the Senate Insurance committee April 8 that the Legislature should not be “rewarding” violators of state law “by letting them stay in business.”

“Congress is pursuing this issue. Why? Because states like Arkansas are not sitting on the sidelines and being quiet about it,” Hammer said. “[If you say], ‘Let’s sit back and wait for Congress,’ like sitting back and waiting for the Lord to come, it ain’t going to happen soon enough.”

After more than a century serving Hammer’s constituents in Benton, Smith-Caldwell Drug Store closed in August 2023 due to financial insolvency and transferred its clients to Walgreens, a national chain that isn’t part of a PBM.

Brad Lawson, a Little Rock-based healthcare supervisor for Walgreens, told lawmakers in December that unfair PBM reimbursements have forced the company to close several locations and plan further closures nationwide.

Walgreens declined to comment Thursday on HB 1150.

Opposition

In an April 4 interview with the Advocate, CVS leaders said the Caremark PBM not only complies with Arkansas law but also reimburses independent pharmacies at a higher rate than its own chain pharmacies. They also said employers whose health insurance plans include CVS will face higher costs.

“Patients are choosing us, they have a choice, and I think we’re not allowing patients to have a choice in this bill,” Chief Pharmacy Officer Lucille Accetta said.

When asked about HB 1150’s potential financial impact on CVS, Accetta and Vice President of External Relations David Whitrap said the losses of pharmacists’ jobs and patients’ access to medication are higher priorities than money.

CVS closed 244 stores between 2018 and 2020 and 900 more stores between 2021 and 2024.

CVS District Leader of Pharmacy Operations Ashley Ellis spoke against the bill at both Insurance and Commerce committee meetings, saying she and her colleagues would lose their jobs if HB 1150 becomes law.

Ellis lives in Greenbrier, represented by Sen. Missy Irvin, R-Mountain View. Irvin was in the minority of Senate committee members to vote against HB 1150, and she said she would not vote for a constituent to lose her job.

Hammer said the potential loss of CVS employees’ jobs is “a lie.”

“If they want to argue these local [corporate] pharmacies shouldn’t be going out of business because they get paid adequately, fine,” he said. “Put your money where your mouth is. Prove it. Start paying yourselves like you’re paying these others.”

Several lawmakers said this month that they supported HB 1150 partly because they received emails urging them to vote against it that appeared to be from constituents but turned out to be from lobbyists opposing the legislation. Rep. Richard McGrew, R-Hot Springs, told the House Insurance Committee that CVS clients in his district had not consented to their names being used for this purpose.

Sen. Mark Johnson, R-Ferndale, told the equivalent Senate committee that he received similar misleading emails.

“This is not grassroots opposition to this bill,” Johnson said. “This is astroturf.”

Besides CVS Health, opponents of HB 1150 included the Arkansas Chamber of Commerce, the Navitus Health Solutions PBM, and the Omnicare and Accredo pharmacies.

Omnicare is owned by CVS Health, and Accredo is a subsidiary of Express Scripts.

Mail order concerns

Several PBMs are affiliated with interstate mail-order pharmacy operations, and House Bill 1150 includes mail-order pharmacy permits among those that PBMs would be prohibited from holding.

Opponents of HB 1150 said it would reduce patients’ access to specialty drugs, some of which might only be accessible via mail-order services – including for military members and veterans who receive pharmaceuticals via the Tricare insurance program’s partnership with Express Scripts.

HB 1150 allows the State Board of Pharmacy to issue limited permits to PBMs if they provide “drugs that are otherwise unavailable in the market to a patient or a pharmacy that would otherwise be prohibited” under the law. Hammer told the Senate this will allow Tricare beneficiaries to continue receiving medications while PBMs transition out of Arkansas.

Despite being a veteran on Tricare, Arkansas Attorney General Tim Griffin’s pharmacy services have been moved from one provider to another by PBM interference, he said in January at a news conference announcing HB 1150. He also said he would defend the legislation in court if it were challenged.

On Monday, Griffin was the lead signatory of a bipartisan letter to Congress from attorneys general in 39 states and territories, advocating for the policy in HB 1150 to be enacted federally.

Griffin sued Express Scripts and OptumRX last year, alleging that they used data from drug manufacturers and distributors to maximize their financial gain instead of using it to mitigate the opioid addiction epidemic.

‘Winners and losers’

Irvin was one of nine senators, mostly Republicans, to vote against HB 1150 last week. She disputed the claim that PBMs have a monopoly in the pharmaceutical industry, saying this is only an opinion without a court’s declaration.

Senate Minority Whip Fred Love, D-Mabelvale, was the chamber’s only Democrat to vote against the bill. Love’s district does not have any local independent pharmacies, and his constituents will lose access to medications if corporate pharmacies like CVS close, he said.

“They’ve been talking to me saying, ‘Guess what? This will hurt us,'” Love said. “So we’re going to manufacture a pharmacy desert in southwest Little Rock? That’s not good for my people.”

Irvin also took issue with a statement April 8 from Greg Reybold, vice president of Healthcare Policy at the American Pharmacy Cooperative, that HB 1150 will “take the ball away” from PBMs in Arkansas’ pharmacy industry.

“We’re using the government to say, ‘We’re getting rid of your competition,'” Irvin said. “ It says that we’re denying a permit to be approved for you, but not for you. You’re picking winners and losers.”

GOP Sen. Justin Boyd, a Fort Smith pharmacist and the vice chairman of the Senate Insurance committee, argued that PBMs’ ability to set their competitors’ prices is actually “picking winners and losers.”

Another 2025 Arkansas law that supporters said will increase patients’ access to medication is Act 52, which removed the state’s ban on nonprofit hospitals holding pharmacy permits. The bill, co-sponsored by Irvin, initially failed in the Senate Public Health, Welfare and Labor Committee but later passed after being amended.

The Arkansas Pharmacists Association opposed Act 52 before it was amended. Vinson told the Senate Insurance committee that Act 52 will create new pharmacy jobs that could make up for any job loss brought about by HB 1150. Both laws will go into effect in August.

And disruptions in the military's health care program have left some pregnant women with gaps in care.

Here’s what to know today.

A growing resistance to Trump, from Van Hollen to Harvard

Sen. Chris Van Hollen confirmed last night that he has met with Kilmar Abrego Garcia, the man that the Trump administration said it mistakenly deported to El Salvador. The meeting comes after Van Hollen, a Democratic senator from Maryland, where Abrego Garcia lived before being deported, traveled to the country this week to push for his release.

Van Hollen shared the news of the meeting in a social media post and said he would provide a full update when he returns to the U.S. He also met this week with human rights groups, local embassy staff members and top Salvadoran officials, including the country’s vice president.

A federal appeals court on Thursday rejected an effort by the Trump administration to put on hold the requirement that it facilitate Abrego Garcia’s release. In the unanimous ruling, the court said the administration was trying to carry out deportations to foreign prisons “without the semblance of due process.”

Van Hollen’s visit to El Salvador and federal courts’ pushback to the Trump administration’s actions on deportations are part of a growing second-term resistance to Trump. Earlier this week, Harvard University refused to yield to a list of Trump demands. In response, the president said he will freeze billions of dollars in federal funding, and his administration threatened to stop foreign students from enrolling the Ivy League school.

Meanwhile in Montana, a crowd swelled for a rally at which Sen. Bernie Sanders and Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez vowed to “fight oligarchy” in the Trump administration. And across the country, Democratic leaders are getting a “massive earful” from their base over those upset with a lack of resistance to the administration’s actions, one person said.

While the actions are still far from a full-fledged revolt, Democrats are trying to harness anti-Trump energy as the party looks ahead to next year’s midterm elections. They’re seeing small-dollar donations ticking up, and state and Congressional elections are beginning to take shape. But angst within the party and disagreements about which issues to focus on could present some complications.

Florida State University shooting leaves 2 dead

The Florida State University community is reeling after a shooting at the Tallahassee campus left two people dead and at least six injured. The suspect in custody was identified as 20-year-old Phoenix Ikner, the son of a sheriff's deputy who is believed to be an FSU student, Leon County Sheriff Walt McNeil said yesterday afternoon. One former classmate says Ikner harbored white supremacist views.

The gunman got out of an orange Hummer and opened fire near the student union just before noon. McKenzie Heeter, a junior at FSU, was outside the building when she said she saw a person “shoot in my direction” with a rifle. Heeter added, “I think he was shooting and he missed. So he goes back into his car and grabs a pistol, then he turns and shoots the lady in front of him. That’s when I just started running.”

The two people who died in the shooting were not FSU students, authorities said. The six injured victims were in fair condition, Tallahassee Memorial Hospital said last night. Here’s what else we know about the shooting.

Police said the suspected shooter has been hospitalized with serious but non-life-threatening injuries. A gun that was a former service weapon belonging to his mother was found on the scene. Here’s what else we know about the suspect.

U.S. 'will move on' from Ukraine peace efforts if no progress within days, Rubio warns

The U.S. may be ready to “move on” from its efforts to broker a peace deal between Russia and Ukraine if there is no clear progress in the coming days, Secretary of State Marco Rubio said Friday.

“We’re not going to continue with this endeavor for weeks and months on end,” Rubio told reporters in Paris after a grueling day of talks among U.S., Ukrainian and European officials in Paris.

“We need to figure out here now, within a matter of days, whether this is doable in the short term, because if it’s not, then I think we’re just going to move on,” he said, adding that President Donald Trump “feels very strongly about that.”

His comments came after Yulia Svyrydenko, Ukraine’s first deputy prime minister and economy minister said that Kyiv and Washington signed a memorandum that is expected to bring both sides closer to clinching a minerals deal that will allow the U.S. access to Ukraine’s rare earth mineral wealth.

Military insurance snafus disrupt care for pregnant women

Air National Guard member Cortney Frazon was trying to check in for a 20-week ultrasound when she discovered her doctor no longer accepted her insurance. Faced with a crushing out-of-pocket cost, she left. Around the same time, at least two medical providers told Audrey Simmons they couldn’t see her because of ongoing negotiations with her insurance, leaving her with limited options during her high-risk pregnancy.

Both women were supposed to be covered by Tricare, the military’s health insurance program, which has been plagued by widespread disruptions after a change in contracts earlier this year. The disruptions have included canceled appointments, a shrinking network of doctors and snafus that have prevented service members and their families from accessing health care. New and expectant mothers have been caught in the chaos during a critical time.

Four women who recently faced issues with Tricare spoke to reporter Melissa Chan, describing feelings of stress, frustration and fear that have overshadowed their pregnancies. “I feel like the military acts like they’re very family-focused, but I feel pretty abandoned,” one said.

I’ve been watching the draft since I was a kid — and when a family vacation took me away from the later rounds, I walked through the airport listening to coverage on the radio. And every year the biggest scuttlebutt is always about the quarterbacks, who play arguably the most important position in any major sport.

Last year’s run on quarterbacks — six in the first 12 picks — was historic, and teams got some serious bang for their buck. But this year’s crop hasn’t generated as much buzz. Here’s where things stand going into next week’s first round and what analysts have to say. — Ben Kamisar, national political reporter

About 16,000 health care providers on the East Coast went unpaid from December 2024 until at least March due to a data error, Humana said.","In the throes of postpartum depression, the incision site from her Cesarean section still tender, a U.S. Navy veteran in Indiana learned she had been dropped by her health insurance.

Some 500 miles away, in Lee’s Summit, Missouri, Air National Guard member Cortney Frazon was trying to check in for a 20-week ultrasound when she discovered her doctor no longer accepted her insurance. Faced with a crushing out-of-pocket cost, she left.

In Kansas City around the same time, at least two medical providers were telling Audrey Simmons they couldn’t see her because of ongoing negotiations with her insurance, leaving her with limited options during her high-risk pregnancy.

The women were all supposed to be covered by the military’s health insurance program called Tricare — a lifelong benefit promised to many who serve, but one that has been plagued by widespread disruptions to service members, their families and the physicians who accept the insurance following a change in contracts that unleashed a cascade of unanticipated consequences.

Top leadership with both the Navy and Air Force have warned that the Tricare upheaval could create enormous problems for service members and their families, from canceled appointments and a shrinking network of doctors to snafus that prevent those who are insured from accessing necessary health care.

“That’s going to have detrimental effects to our family, to our family readiness and possibly to our military readiness,” Master Chief Petty Officer of the Navy James Honea testified last week during a congressional hearing on quality-of-life issues for members of the military.

This chaos is particularly urgent and damaging for new and expectant mothers, when health experts say medical and mental health care is crucial. Four women who recently faced issues with Tricare that disrupted their medical care told NBC News that the stress overshadowed their excitement about their pregnancies. It has caused them to question a health system meant to take care of members of the military and their loved ones.

“It’s just so stressful,” said Simmons, who is four months pregnant. “I feel like the military acts like they’re very family-focused, but I feel pretty abandoned.”

The Defense Health Agency, which runs Tricare, said it could not comment on individual cases, citing federal privacy laws, and would not confirm whether the problems detailed by the women were caused by the larger Tricare disruptions.

“The uniformed service members and their families deserve the best health care available and anytime there is a shortfall of any kind we take it seriously and strive to correct it and reduce the chances of it happening in the future,” the agency said in a statement.

With little to no out-of-pocket costs depending on the plan, Tricare is billed as a major perk to those who join the armed forces, especially in the U.S., where the inability to pay for health care and medicine recently hit a new high, a recent survey found. Health care costs are only growing. In 2024, the national average annual health insurance premium for an individual was nearly $9,000, according to KFF, a nonprofit research organization formerly known as the Kaiser Family Foundation.

Military members who serve at least 20 years, or those who retire for medical reasons, can keep their coverage for life, and so can their spouses. Their children can also stay enrolled until age 21, or 23 if they attend college, said Eileen Huck, acting director of government relations for the National Military Family Association, which advocates for service members and their families.

Tricare serves about 9.5 million people, including active-duty service members, National Guard and Reserve members, military retirees and their families. About a third are active-duty service members or their loved ones, according to the latest data.

In a March news release, Tricare extolled its maternity care benefits and its newly expanded childbirth and breastfeeding support services. In addition to routine doctor visits, ultrasounds and deliveries, Tricare also pays for unlimited doula care during birth, prenatal and postpartum physical therapy, breast pumps and even a third dental cleaning in a 12-month period.

“It is a very valuable benefit,” Huck said. “It is definitely an incentive to join the military and stay in the military, knowing that you and your family will have this health care coverage.”

Simmons, 30, her three young children and her husband, a Missouri Air National Guard member, have been covered for the last three years. She found out in mid-January that she was pregnant, and when she called to make a doctor’s appointment, she was told her OB-GYN couldn’t see her because of ongoing insurance negotiations.

Her concerns grew when her endocrinologist said the same thing, and the hospital where she was initially referred also wasn’t an option. She tried to find a provider she could see. Within 50 miles of her home, only one facility came up — a hospital where she used to work and where she said she and her family had negative experiences.

It was a big change from her previous pregnancy, when she had no trouble finding and booking appointments with in-network providers.

“I’m having to fight with insurance constantly and feeling literally like I have nowhere to go when there’s a problem,” Simmons said. “I almost feel like we don’t have insurance.”

She vented on BabyCenter, a pregnancy-support app with an online forum, and learned she was not alone. About 20 miles away in Lee’s Summit, Frazon wrote on the app that she was also frustrated by the health care system and heartbroken to lose her trusted doctor, too.

Frazon, 35, a heavy equipment operator with the Air National Guard, didn’t know that her OB-GYN had left the network until she arrived for her 20-week ultrasound in February, she told NBC News.

“That’s like the first one they do when you get to see the baby,” she said. “I was super excited about it.”

After two miscarriages, Frazon hoped the ultrasound, a scan of her baby’s anatomy that shows growth and development, would ease her nerves. But when she checked in for her appointment, she said the receptionist told her she’d have to pay out of pocket for the visit because the office no longer accepted Tricare. (The health care provider told NBC News it’s working to finalize an agreement with a new Tricare contractor.)

“I had to have them tell me multiple times because I wasn’t processing it,” Frazon said.

She chose not to pay out of pocket — or come back. She said it hurt to lose a physician she had built a five-year relationship with, who understood her health history and prior complications, but she could not afford the full costs.

Frazon said she called Tricare for a list of other providers within 30 miles.

“They gave me two,” she said. Frazon booked with one and had the scan done.

The Defense Health Agency outsources Tricare operations, relying on two companies to manage health care benefits in its two U.S. regions. Much of the wider trouble began Jan. 1, when a company called TriWest Healthcare Alliance took over West Coast management and took on six additional states that were once part of the East Coast region managed by a different contractor, Humana Military.

Tricare is honoring referrals made under the previous contractor through the end of June, the Defense Health Agency said in a statement. And providers, including hospitals that were considered in-network under the last contractor, are being treated as in-network until then.

The transition was a “huge undertaking,” but the Defense Health Agency said it took “painstaking steps” to limit potential interruptions.

The new contract was meant to “improve health care delivery, quality, and access” for U.S. beneficiaries, the agency said.

That’s not what has happened. About 16,000 health care providers on the East Coast went unpaid from December 2024 until at least March due to a data error, Humana said. That forced many to drop Tricare patients altogether, reduce their hours or even consider closing their clinics. On the West Coast, federal officials said beneficiaries have been struggling with long wait times at call centers and delays with processing new referrals for outpatient specialty care.

Humana said it fixed the data issue in March. TriWest referred questions to the Defense Health Agency.

Civilian providers are increasingly critical to Tricare’s network, after funding shortages reduced availability at military facilities. The longer the disruptions go on, the more concern grows that civilian providers may drop off, Honea, the senior Navy leader, said during his House testimony last week. The Defense Health Agency confirmed to NBC News that providers have left the West Coast region but would not say how many.

In the meantime, there’s been finger-pointing, with providers telling some of the pregnant women that Tricare issues were to blame and the Defense Health Agency saying some providers were failing to honor the referral waivers.

Another issue is Tricare demanding repayment of previously paid claims. In Nevada, a Navy veteran and his wife said Tricare had rescinded over $100,000 in medical claims it had approved and paid years ago. While officials still have not said what prompted the reversals, the couple said Tricare resolved the issue after NBC News published an article about their plight in March, ensuring they did not owe anything.

The disruptions meant that Marine Corps Sgt. Savannah Harper, 27, had trouble getting prenatal care in January after she transferred from a California base to one in Hawaii.

When she went to a new medical center for prenatal care, she said she was told she didn’t have a referral on file and couldn’t be seen.

Harper said she repeatedly called Tricare for help, enduring wait times of up to 90 minutes with no resolution.

By early February, she was a full month overdue for her 20-week ultrasound. “I could feel her moving, so I knew she was OK generally, but I didn’t know what limbs she had,” she said. “It was very, very nerve-wracking.”

Desperate, she said she tried to see an Army OB-GYN at a military hospital. After 30 minutes of waiting, she said they told her to call her insurance. Harper said she stormed up to the hospital’s labor and delivery unit and burst into tears. “My emotions were everywhere,” she said.

She said providers there gave her an ultrasound and a referral to get further care off-base. She said she called a list of civilian physicians and took the first one who had an opening.

“It’s been very scary,” said Harper, who is due in mid-May.

Early and consistent health care during pregnancy is critical and can help prevent complications for both the mother and the fetus, according to Dr. Noha Ahmed, a resident OB-GYN at MedStar Washington Hospital Center in Washington, D.C.

Each step matters, as does the timing. Blood tests done around 10 to 13 weeks of pregnancy can detect chromosomal abnormalities, while a 20-week anatomy scan, a major milestone, identifies whether the fetus and its organs are growing adequately, Ahmed said.

Around 25 weeks, a screening can determine risks for gestational diabetes. In the last trimester, Ahmed said, weekly visits are recommended.

“Pregnancy is not a benign condition. It takes a really big toll on the mother,” Ahmed said.

The Navy veteran from Indiana who found out that Tricare had dropped her after she gave birth had no problem enrolling last year in the maternity program run by Humana. In an email reviewed by NBC News, a case manager welcomed her to the program in September, when she was six months pregnant. She delivered the baby on Christmas Eve.

The health care was a bright spot in an otherwise troubling end to her service. She had retired from the military in 2017 because of post-traumatic stress disorder, developed after she said she was raped by another sailor. Her certificate of release from active duty, which NBC News reviewed, shows she was honorably separated under disability retirement — so she was eligible for Tricare.

“The one consolation I had walking away was at least I have my health care so I can start over,” the woman said. NBC News is withholding her name because she said she was a victim of sexual assault. “I feel robbed.”

In January, when she went to a local military office with her marriage certificate, separation papers and her baby’s birth certificate to add her newborn daughter as a dependent, she said she was told she was no longer eligible for insurance, over what she believes was a recordkeeping mistake.

She insisted she should get health care coverage; she had a letter from the Department of Veterans Affairs, which NBC News reviewed, confirming she had a permanent disability connected with her military service.

Soon after, she said she got a call canceling her six-week postpartum appointment because the doctor’s office had been notified that she was uninsured.

She also had to cancel her mental health appointments to treat her postpartum depression and anxiety and begin to ration the medication she had left. She got what she thought was norovirus — vomiting, chills and fatigue — but didn’t see a doctor.

And she struggled with breastfeeding, as many new mothers do. Under Tricare she would have had access to breastfeeding counseling and a dozen other postpartum services.

“I feel like I have failed her,” she said of her baby girl. “This anxiety is worse than it had to be. It’s constant.”

Amid all this, Tricare sent a series of letters, which NBC News reviewed, requesting more than $15,700 in refunds from her medical providers for 66 claims from February 2024 until after she gave birth.

The letters said the providers were responsible for repaying Tricare, and “should there be a need for the beneficiary to make a payment, you will be contacted directly by your provider.” She’s waiting to hear if she’ll need to pay.

In its statement to NBC News, the Defense Health Agency suggested the veteran reach out to customer service.

But she’s long past that. She cobbled together temporary insurance for her baby under a separate Veterans Affairs program, and her husband’s regular enrollment period opened recently, allowing them all to get coverage under his civilian job. The benefits kicked in on April 1.

The first thing she did was book appointments: one for her baby’s four-month check-up, one to see about the painful lumps at her incision site, and another to address her deteriorating mental health.","https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_nbcnews-fp-1200-630,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2025-04/250417-pregnant-women-military-insurance-tricare-cover-se-219a-08b126.jpg",N,-1.0,2025-04-18 05:56:27.335039
