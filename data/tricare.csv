The Tennessee National Guard Association played a key role in advocating for the legislation and working with lawmakers to get it passed.

Known as the “Tennessee National Guard Servicemember’s Medical Readiness Act,” the new law helps Guardsmen offset the cost of healthcare premiums under TRICARE Reserve Select and the TRICARE Dental Program.

Previously, traditional Guardsmen, those serving part-time under state or federal orders for training, were responsible for paying the full cost of their TRICARE coverage unless insured through a civilian employer. While deployed on federal active duty, they receive full medical coverage, but during regular training periods, they were responsible for purchasing their own insurance. For many, this meant covering TRICARE premiums themselves to maintain continuous coverage.

“This legislation improves access to healthcare for our Soldiers and Airmen,” said Maj. Gen. Warner Ross, Tennessee’s Adjutant General. “It will increase our overall medical readiness and ensures that our Guardsmen will have access to healthcare throughout their service, regardless of duty status.”

This program is expected to benefit nearly 2,000 servicemembers when it takes effect on July 1st. To qualify, Tennessee Guardsmen must be enrolled in TRICARE Reserve Select or the TRICARE Dental Program and must not receive comparable coverage from a civilian employer.

The Tennessee National Guard Association played a key role in advocating for the legislation and working with lawmakers to get it passed.

“Our Soldiers and Airmen make real sacrifices to serve their state and nation, and this program ensures they remain ready to answer the call when their fellow citizens need them the most,” said Lt. Col. Meredith Richardson, President of the National Guard Association of Tennessee.

This initiative reflects Tennessee’s ongoing efforts to support its National Guard members, ensuring they have access to healthcare resources while serving the state and nation.

Stars and Stripes serves the U.S. military community by providing editorially independent news and information around the world.

Inconsistencies between states could have cost U.S. taxpayers and Tricare beneficiaries millions of dollars in excessive payments for some medical procedures and devices, a watchdog report has found.

The cost of certain medical procedures and devices varied greatly from state to state, according to a Pentagon inspector general audit published May 1. That probe found Tricare — the military's Defense Health Agency-run medical insurance provider that covers some 9.5 million troops, veterans and their family members — paid out thousands of dollars more for similar procedures and medical devices in some states versus others. The report found inconsistent DHA policies governing the amount of money that Tricare pays for medical care.

[READ THE REPORT]

In one instance, the IG found Tricare was paying some $11,500 for custom sleep apnea mouthguards in Illinois that were costing it about $3,000 in neighboring Iowa. The payment discrepancy came about because Tricare, which is split into two regions in the U.S. with Illinois in its east section and Iowa in its west, uses contractors to establish a basic pay rate, known as a prevailing rate, for standard procedures and devices based on the amounts that providers in those states had charged Tricare in the past. The state's prevailing rate is then set at the 80th percentile of all those charges.

The IG found there were no efforts to ensure payment rates were more consistent from one state to another. The auditors recommended Defense Health Agency officials reevaluate their methodology and ensure payment rates are not based on fraudulent or unreasonable rates charged in the past.

""Because the DHA did not determine that the state prevailing rates were reasonable, the [Defense Department] is at risk of wasteful spending and increasing DOD beneficiaries' risk of unreasonable cost-shares for health care services and items that are paid with state prevailing rates,"" the report states.

The probe also found Tricare might have been overpaying for some more rare procedures that do not have a set reimbursement rate. In fiscal 2023, Tricare paid some $183.3 million for 184 of those ""miscellaneous procedure costs."" The IG found in some cases Tricare might have paid greatly inflated rental rates for medical equipment in that miscellaneous category.

[UPDATED MONTHLY: MOAA's TRICARE Toolkit]

In one Tricare East case, the organization paid about $5,000 per month to rent a compression device for a beneficiary when another supplier advertised renting the same device for $675 per month. Still another supplier advertised it sold a different model of a similar device for $409.50, according to the report.

The IG said despite the discrepancies, recent changes to Tricare policies have led to lowered costs for the organization since 2021.",https://insurancenewsnet.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/inn-social-default.jpg,N,-1.0,2025-06-04 22:56:48.275695

Published 5:21 pm Wednesday, June 4, 2025

Getting your Trinity Audio player ready...

By AMAC Certified Social Security Advisor Russell Gloor, Association of Mature American Citizens

Dear Rusty: I’m a retired Navy veteran who is going to be turning 65 years old this year. My question is concerning mandatory Medicare sign-up requirements. Why do I have to sign up for Medicare coverage at 65 when I can’t start collecting full Social Security benefits until I turn 67? My Social Security benefits will not pay for my mandatory Medicare because I can’t start collecting full Social Security benefits until I’m 67!

I currently pay for TriCare and utilize my local Veterans Administration medical facilities and referrals for my healthcare. With me turning 65 and having to wait until I’m 67 for my full Social Security benefits, it just seems unfair that I’ll have to pay out of pocket Medicare monthly expenses for two years! Is there any way to avoid this unfair penalty? Signed: Retired Navy Vet

Get the latest headlines sent to you

Dear Retired Navy Vet: First, I want to thank you for your military service to our country. Please know that here at the AMAC Foundation we care a lot about our veterans, and you may find the “For Veterans” section of our Foundation website interesting (amacfoundation.org).

Regarding your question, you should be aware that enrolling in Medicare is not mandatory, but there are consequences if you do not enroll when you become eligible (normally at age 65). For one thing, if you are a retired veteran on military TriCare, you will lose your TriCare benefits if you don’t enroll in Medicare when you are eligible (TriCare requires that you enroll in Medicare when eligible). And, since you are not yet collecting Social Security, you will be required to separately pay the Medicare Part B premium directly to Medicare (they will bill you when you enroll in Medicare). Another potential consequence is that if you do not enroll in Medicare Part B when you are first eligible, you may incur a lifetime late enrollment penalty for enrolling in Part B later.

Something else to keep in mind is that there are two “parts” to Medicare – Part A (which is coverage for inpatient hospitalization services), and Part B, which is coverage for outpatient healthcare services (doctors, medical tests, etc.). Medicare Part A is free to you, but there is a premium for Medicare Part B ($185/month for 2025). Note that you will need to pay a Part B premium as long as you are enrolled in Medicare Part B (it doesn’t go away after you are collecting Social Security, but it is taken from your Social Security payment). And there is no way for you to avoid the Part B premium after enrolling, and enrolling in Part B is necessary for you to continue your military TriCare-for-life benefits. Note that Medicare Part A and Part B do not include prescription drug coverage, but your TriCare coverage usually does.

It’s important to note that Medicare and Social Security are two independent senior programs with different eligibility rules. As you may know, you can collect early (reduced) Social Security at age 65 (and have your Medicare Part B premium deducted from your Social Security payment). But you would be collecting Social Security early and, in addition to a reduced benefit, you would also be subject to Social Security’s annual earnings test if you are still working. The Social Security earnings test limits how much you can earn before some of your SS benefits are taken away (if you exceed the earning limit prior to your full retirement age).

So, is it unfair that you must pay for Medicare Part B before you are collecting Social Security? Well, I think not, because the two programs are completely independent benefits (the Social Security Administration merely administers Medicare payments as a convenience). Remember your Medicare Part A is free, but you must pay a premium for Part B, and you must take both to retain your military TriCare-for-Life benefits. You can visit this site to see how to pay your Medicare premiums until it is later deducted from your Social Security payment: medicare.gov/basics/costs/pay-premiums/online-bill-pay.

Once again, thank you for your service to our country.

Here's our complete guide to everything you need to know about ABA therapy.","Applied Behavior Analysis (ABA) is a therapy rooted in the science of learning and behavior. Using principles of ABA, children and adults can learn to improve their communication skills, social skills, and daily living skills while also addressing problematic or challenging behaviors. The primary goal of ABA therapy is to teach helpful skills that promote independence and reduce harmful behaviors. Here's our complete guide to everything you need to know about ABA therapy.

It's a big decision to make for your family! Applied behavior analysis (ABA) seeks to improve communication skills, introduce productive habits, and reduce harmful behaviors. Watch out for ABA providers who look to ""cure"" autism.

High quality ABA therapy does exist where the goal is not to “fix” children, make them appear “less autistic”, or change who they are. The goal is to help people learn all that they can so they can live to their potential while embracing their unique, individual personality traits. Here's our complete guide to start and end ABA therapy.

ABA looks different from other therapy settings. Typically, ABA therapy occurs multiple times a week and can take place in the home, community, or in a clinic setting. Depending on your child's needs, you might need to commit up to 40 hours a week.

ABA therapy can last for a few months to a few years. During that time, children and their families are committed to training and learning together. Therapy ideally ends when children meet their goals. Check out our complete guide for how to start and end ABA therapy.

ABA is usually covered by insurance if you have an autism diagnosis. Autism is typically the only diagnosis insurance will authorize for ABA services since its benefits have been researched extensively.

Always check with your specific insurance plan to confirm that ABA is covered for your child’s diagnoses and that the provider you are seeking care at is in-network.

The letter also requests financial information related to pediatric gender-affirming care paid for “in whole or in part” by the federal government.

The Trump Administration’s focus on the treatment of gender dysphoria for children began shortly after the President’s inauguration. Executive Order 14187, “Protecting Children From Chemical and Surgical Mutilation,” was released on January 28, 2025 and defined “children” to include individuals under 19 years of age. The EO directed agencies to end grant funding for institutions that provide gender-affirming care for individuals under 19 and take steps to end coverage for gender-affirming care rendered to individuals under 19 under TRICARE and the Federal Employee Health Benefits program, among other directives. The funding provision of the EO has since been enjoined nationwide by the U.S. District Court for the District of Maryland, which is on appeal before the Fourth Circuit. See PFLAG, Inc. v. Trump, No. CV 25-337-BAH, 2025 WL 685124 (D. Md. Mar. 4, 2025).

The May 28, 2025 letter comes weeks after the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) issued a 409-page report sharply criticizing the gender-affirming care practices that have been widely adopted and accepted by medical societies and health care systems throughout much of the world. Citing the report, the May 28 letter to hospitals states CMS’s concerns with medical interventions related to gender-affirming care in children and requests that hospitals provide CMS within 30 days with their policies and procedures related to:

Informed consent protocols for children with gender dysphoria;

Changes to clinical practice guidelines and protocols the hospital plans to enact considering the report published by HHS; and

Any adverse events related to gender-affirming care procedures, particularly for those who may wish to “detransition” at a later date.

The letter also requests financial data related to pediatric gender-affirming care (which the letter refers to as “sex trait modification,” consistent with the proposed rules issued by the Trump Administration in March that would prohibit coverage of gender-affirming care by Affordable Care Act plans) procedures performed at the institution and paid, in whole or in part, by the federal government, including:

All billing codes used for “pediatric sex trat modifications (and that correspond with pediatric sex trait modification procedures not determined to be medically necessary)”;

Facility- and provider-level revenue or utilization data generated directly or indirectly from these procedures since 2020;

Facility- and provider-level operating and profit margins for each procedure type, including for directly or indirectly owned or affiliated providers; and

Projected revenue forecasts for these service lines.

On the same day the CMS letter was sent requesting information from hospitals, HHS Secretary Robert F. Kennedy, Jr. sent a letter to health care providers, risk managers, and state medical boards urging them to read the HHS report and stating that the agency “expects” them to promptly update treatment protocols and training to conform with the report. Despite the stated expectation, to date, HHS has not issued any new rules or requirements to mandate updates to providers’ policies and procedures.

Health care providers and health systems that have been contacted by HHS should consult with counsel to assess their options and obligations, including legal requirements related to gender-affirming care that may vary by state.",https://www.crowell.com/a/web/eqtMm2SjrhZUkGeJfhm2Wp/arfRwn/20250604-cms-issues-letters-linkedin.jpg,N,-1.0,2025-06-04 17:56:22.725219

We are seeing a family therapist who does not take insurance, she issues us a superbill and we pay in full. I am retired and am enrolled in Select. My first volley at a claim was denied due to ""the provider not being authorized in the Tricare program"" and ""the provider may bill you for the lesser of their charges or 115% of the Tricare maximum allowable charges"".

My impression from the Tricare website and from numerous conversations with Tricare agents is that claims for non-participating providers can be approved as long as the treatment codes line up with what Tricare covers (this therapist was sure to include that on the bill) even if the provider is not certified with Tricare. As far as the maximum allowable charge for the procedure, from the minimal amount of info I was able to find on the website, it seems that Tricare's max is far below what this provider charged. So, my question there is whether my deductible would kick in at some point if I just paid the excess above the MAC.

The primary goal of ABA therapy is to teach helpful skills that promote independence and reduce harmful behaviors. Here's our complete guide to everything you need to know about ABA therapy.

It's a big decision to make for your family! Applied behavior analysis (ABA) seeks to improve communication skills, introduce productive habits, and reduce harmful behaviors. Watch out for ABA providers who look to ""cure"" autism.

High quality ABA therapy does exist where the goal is not to “fix” children, make them appear “less autistic”, or change who they are. The goal is to help people learn all that they can so they can live to their potential while embracing their unique, individual personality traits. Here's our complete guide to start and end ABA therapy.

ABA looks different from other therapy settings. Typically, ABA therapy occurs multiple times a week and can take place in the home, community, or in a clinic setting. Depending on your child's needs, you might need to commit up to 40 hours a week.

ABA therapy can last for a few months to a few years. During that time, children and their families are committed to training and learning together. Therapy ideally ends when children meet their goals. Check out our complete guide for how to start and end ABA therapy.

ABA is usually covered by insurance if you have an autism diagnosis. Autism is typically the only diagnosis insurance will authorize for ABA services since its benefits have been researched extensively.

Always check with your specific insurance plan to confirm that ABA is covered for your child’s diagnoses and that the provider you are seeking care at is in-network.

Depending on your plan, you’ll learn: Steps you need to take if you’re moving within the same TRICARE region or to a different TRICARE region, or if you’re moving to or from the U.S.
Go to Moving and click on the TRICARE plan you had in your old location to learn what to do.
Are you no longer eligible for the TRICARE health plan you had before you moved?
If you have a different TRICARE plan, you can use the Find a Doctor Tool to search for a new provider.","JUNE 4, 2025 – Are you preparing to move to a new location? Now is the best time to make sure your TRICARE benefits are ready to move with you.

“You can use TRICARE wherever you live, but there are actions you can take to help avoid interruptions to your health care and TRICARE benefits,” said Dr. Danita Hunter, chief, TRICARE Health Plan Policy & Programs Branch, at the Defense Health Agency. “Before you move, learn about what these actions are and how your health plan options may change.”

Here’s a TRICARE checklist to help you prepare for your move and what you may need to do after you get to your new location.

Before you move

FIRST: Check out TRICARE’s Moving page.

TRICARE’s Moving page has general information about what do before and after you move. The page also has summaries of what you need to do based on which health plan you’re enrolled in before you move. Depending on your plan, you’ll learn:

Steps you need to take if you’re moving within the same TRICARE region or to a different TRICARE region, or if you’re moving to or from the U.S.

If you’re able to transfer your TRICARE Prime enrollment before you move

No matter which health plan you have, keep these things in mind:

Don’t disenroll from any plan before you move. You’re covered by your current plan on your way to your new location.

Update your address and other contact information in the Defense Enrollment Eligibility Reporting System after you move.

SECOND: Learn how your health plan options might change.

The TRICARE health plans you qualify for may change when you move. For example, your eligibility for TRICARE Prime can change based on who you are and where you move to.

You can use the Plan Finder to see which plans you may qualify for in your new location. Not sure which plan is right for you? You can use the Compare Plans Tool to compare the features of different plans side by side.

Moving is sometimes a TRICARE Qualifying Life Event. Relocation must be to a new country, city, region, or ZIP+4 code to be a QLE. You have 90 days from the date of your address change in DEERS to change your health plan.

THIRD: Get health services and request copies of your health records.

Before you move, catch up on getting your routine care and specialty care, if needed. Be sure to discuss any ongoing health issues and prescriptions with your current primary care manager, primary care provider, or specialist.

Do you have any active referrals? These referrals will still be valid in your new location. (Note: This doesn’t apply if you have an active referral you received with the current referral approval waiver in the West Region.)

Before you move, call the regional contractor for your current location to request your referrals be transferred to the regional contractor for your new location. Your referrals won’t be transferred unless you or your provider requests this. Once you set up your enrollment with your new regional contractor, you can ask the contractor to help you find a provider. The contractor may also be able to help make your first appointment with a new specialist.

If you see any civilian medical or dental providers, be sure to ask for copies of your records to take with you. Talk to your TRICARE contractor for more information on requesting and transferring records.

Are you a service member under permanent change of station orders? Ensure you out-process at your military hospital or clinic. You can also request to transfer your family members’ health records to the military hospital or clinic at your new duty station.

FOURTH: Fill prescriptions.

Make sure you have enough of your medication to last during and immediately after your move. Learn more about filling prescriptions.

After you move

FIRST: Update your contact information.

After you move, update your address and contact information in DEERS as soon as possible. Up-to-date DEERS records are vital to accessing your TRICARE benefits. Incorrect addresses can cause issues with eligibility, claims, billing, authorization letters for referrals, and filling prescriptions. Learn how to update your DEERS record.

For many TRICARE plans, you should also update your contact information with the regional contractor for your new location. (If you pay enrollment fees or premiums, it is also a good time to check with your regional contractor to see if you need to make any updates to your payment method.) Go to Moving and click on the TRICARE plan you had in your old location to learn what to do. You don’t need to do this if you have TRICARE For Life, as described in the TRICARE For Life Handbook.

Are you enrolled in the TRICARE Dental Program? You should call the TDP contractor, United Concordia, to update your contact information.

SECOND: Change your health plan within 90 days.

Are you no longer eligible for the TRICARE health plan you had before you moved? If so, you must enroll in a new health plan within 90 days of updating your address in DEERS. If you don’t, you’ll only be eligible for care and pharmacy services at a military hospital or clinic, if space is available. After 90 days, you can only enroll in a plan after another TRICARE QLE or during TRICARE Open Season.

THIRD: Choose a new primary care manager or find a provider.

If you have a TRICARE Prime plan, you may need to choose a new primary care manager.

If you have a different TRICARE plan, you can use the Find a Doctor Tool to search for a new provider. If you’re looking for providers in the U.S., be sure to enter the ZIP code for your new location to make sure you get to the right provider directory.

FOURTH: Update your TRICARE Pharmacy Home Delivery mailing address.

Do you get prescriptions through TRICARE Pharmacy Home Delivery? Be sure to update your mailing address with the TRICARE Pharmacy Program contractor, Express Scripts. Keep in mind that there are different rules for using home delivery outside the U.S. and U.S. territories.

Providers can bill VA and TRICARE at Medicare rates, and Medicare pays a lot more when care is provided in a hospital setting.

The law of the land encourages taxpayer-funded health insurance programs like Medicare, VA, and TRICARE to reduce competition and drive up prices.
I feel like a pawn in a backwards health care system, one that incentivizes using health care for the military and their families as a money maker.","Medical billing is shrouded in mystery, and the final dollar amounts often come as a surprise at the least opportune time.

A few years ago, while my Marine husband was deployed overseas, I broke my thumb and needed to visit the emergency room for treatment. I went to a large, nearby hospital off-base where I received medical attention and was sent home.

I’m sure the billing department had cartoon-like dollar signs for eyes when they saw my insurance information. I was covered by TRICARE, the military’s insurance provider.

Government-provided health insurance providers — think TRICARE, VA health coverage, or Medicare — operate differently, but not when it comes to reimbursement rates. Providers can bill VA and TRICARE at Medicare rates, and Medicare pays a lot more when care is provided in a hospital setting.

Treating me meant the hospital could bill my insurance provider at a much higher rate than the care actually costs. Had it been delivered elsewhere, by an independent provider, it would have been cheaper. Hospitals bill at the higher rate because the law allows them to. The bill was bigger, not because of the quality of the care, but because of where I went to get it.

This disparity incentivizes hospitals to become monopolies, because when independent physician practices and outpatient facilities merge with a larger hospital system, the system can charge more, despite there being no improvement in convenience or quality.

Medicare pays out 106%-217% more to these facilities and large systems than it does to the smaller, privately owned facilities. Hospitals use Medicare rates for billing care for service members and their families who have Tricare, as well as veterans who are covered under the VA for their health insurance.

Under both systems, hospitals are essentially allowed to rip the government off when veterans and their families utilize the community care (care outside of a military or VA facility) they’re entitled to.

So large hospital systems buy up their competition, reclassify the newly acquired facilities as hospital-based settings, and then raise their prices with impunity, because there is no competition or incentive to drive costs down. The share of practices owned by hospitals more than doubled between 2013 and 2018, and by 2020, more than half of all physicians worked either directly for a hospital or in a hospital-owned practice.

These facilities give you the exact same services, but at a much higher cost.

This is why people think the medical industry is dishonest. But it’s just working within the loopholes and special circumstances the government has created.

The law of the land encourages taxpayer-funded health insurance programs like Medicare, VA, and TRICARE to reduce competition and drive up prices. That equals fewer options with high out-of-pocket costs for patients.

Luckily, there is a commonsense solution that can fix this issue - site neutrality.

The principle behind site-neutrality is simple: “same service, same price,” regardless of where you get the care. This would unleash competition and drive down costs for seniors, veterans, and service members, and save taxpayers money, too. Those are wins for everyone.

Naturally, the powerful hospital lobby is opposed to such a concept. But site neutrality is widely popular and bipartisan as it increases access and lowers costs — two things Americans are hungry for in their health care.

Senator John Kennedy of Louisiana recently introduced the Same Care, Lower Cost Act (S-1629) to end this unfair billing practice. If enacted, the bill would save taxpayers $157 billionover its first 10 years.

And over in the House, Representative Rich McCormick of Georgia, a veteran and former emergency room physician, is seeking to break the logjam with a pair of new bills would specifically address the situation I found myself in: the Servicemember Site-Neutrality Act(HR-873) and the Veterans Site-Neutrality Act (HR-874), which would institute site-neutral payments in TRICARE and the VA, respectively.

If enacted, medical care for veterans and service members will be billed at a lower rate for the same care they’re getting today, with the same quality, and with more options to choose from. They would also save the VA and the DoD health care programs taxpayer dollars, making it easier to fully fund desperately needed options like the VA Community Care Program created by the historic VA MISSION Act.

As a military spouse, it especially bothers me that my care and that of military families and veterans cost more for no good reason. I feel like a pawn in a backwards health care system, one that incentivizes using health care for the military and their families as a money maker.

That’s why I’m so glad to see site-neutral legislation targeted at care for the military community. We’re not looking for handouts, “perks,” or anything dishonest or unfair.

Veterans and service members earned their care. They should have access to it at the highest quality and convenience — at competitive, affordable prices. Site-neutrality is the answer.",https://assets.realclear.com/images/64/646336_6_.jpg,N,-1.0,2025-06-04 12:56:45.448289

Some other common things speech therapists can help with:

Nonverbal skills, such as signs or gestures

Forming speech in a clearer way

Communicating thoughts and feelings clearly

Understanding and responding to questions

Discerning facial expressions and their corresponding emotions

Noticing and understanding body language

Feeding and swallowing

Stuttering

Speech therapy is almost always recommended for autistic children since many people with autism have difficulty with social communication. Even if a child is very verbal and says a lot of words, they might need to work on communication skills like:

responding to questions

starting or ending conversation

changing conversation topics

using gestures like pointing

understanding other people's body language

Speech therapy is a big focus in early intervention for autistic children and is usually the starting place for recently diagnosed kids. There is a critical period in the brain for language development and so, it's really important to teach language and communication skills as early as possible, especially if there are any delays in that area. Your child will learn effective ways to communicate which will help them grow into more independent and confident individuals.

It might be obvious when a child struggles with speaking —they are very quiet, say only a few words, or don't speak at all.

But the MHS is unlike any health care system in the United States – we go to war.
From keeping service members healthy here at home to mitigating disease overseas, we keep guns in the fight.
Medically ready forces keep guns in the fight and ready medical forces honor the pact that America makes to its sons and daughters to provide world-class medical care anytime, anywhere, under any conditions.
The MHS is one of the best healthcare systems in America and the very best military medical system in the world.","FALLS CHURCH, Virginia – One of George Washington’s many wise aphorisms, “To be prepared for war is one of the most effective means of preserving peace,” is timeless. Teddy Roosevelt updated the maxim for audiences of his time, advising the country to, “Speak softly and carry a big stick.” Today we press for Peace through Strength.

The Military Health System (MHS) is a key element in executing this strategy. With a global network of 700+ hospitals and clinics and more than 130,000 military and civilian healthcare professionals standing the watch, the MHS ensures America possesses a medically ready force that is fit to fight at a moment’s notice. The MHS sees optimizing the human factor as our strategic edge in combat. But the MHS is unlike any health care system in the United States – we go to war.

From keeping service members healthy here at home to mitigating disease overseas, we keep guns in the fight. By bringing operating rooms and ICUs to the front lines, aboard ships, and in the sky, we empower warfighters to take heroic risks, confident that the world’s best doctors, nurses, and medics have their back at each step and upon every acre on earth. There is nothing the MHS won’t do: no research too ambitious, no device too expensive, no distance too far to preserve or restore the health of our warfighters.

As Acting Assistant Secretary of Defense for Health Affairs, I’m proud to be charged with guaranteeing our medical forces provide world-class medical care and deploy rapidly to support any and all American military missions. The responsibility doesn’t end there. The MHS also ensures those who protect hearth and home -family members - also receive world-class medical care. This empowers deployed Service members to remain mission-focused without having to worry about the health of their spouse or child.

We also fulfill the solemn compact to provide health care to those retirees who devoted their life’s work and innumerable sacrifices in the service of this Nation. As a retired Navy physician and a military spouse, I understand the sacrifices Service members and their families make, both what it’s like to deploy and what it’s like to be left behind. This mission is both intensely personal and intensely rewarding.

That’s why the current underperformance of the new TRICARE contract is especially frustrating to me. The TRICARE health plan is a key pillar of the military’s healthcare delivery system. Millions of family members and retirees rely on TRICARE’s network of providers and hospitals for both medical care and mental health services, like autism care that families count on each and every day. The Defense Health Agency

and I are working tirelessly to hold the contractors accountable, to grant waivers to ensure access to specialty care, and to help families navigate this transition. We’re making progress, but not quickly enough. I will continue to work on behalf of military families until this system is fixed, and to ensure this doesn’t happen again.

The garrison mission of the MHS is carried out in military medical treatment facilities across the globe. The mission is best distilled to its essence: readiness. Medical readiness is combat readiness, and while we’re grateful to have the current moment of relative peace, we must remain vigilant. When the enemy strikes, we need our Service members physically fit, mentally aware, and healthy to defend our nation.

Throughout history, interwar periods have had a pernicious effect on medical readiness, so much so that these periods bear the eponym: The Walker Dip. In 2018, Surgeon General of the British Armed Forces Vice Admiral Alasdair Walker described a recurring and troubling pattern dating back to the 19th century. From the Napoleonic War (1803-1815) to Iraq and Afghanistan, hard-earned lessons and experience gained in combat, such as the importance of specialized trauma care and transfusion medicine, are forgotten and must be relearned. Sadly, these skills “dips” diminish survival rates, resulting in greater injury and loss of life. Forewarned is forearmed. It’s my personal mission to ensure that the skills and expertise leading to the historically high battlefield survival rates that we achieved in Iraq and Afghanistan are never forgotten.

In a world of profound geopolitical risk and competing economic priorities, how can military medicine avoid the Walker Dip? How can it successfully compete for resources with modernization and replenishment of our weapons stock? Simply put, we can’t afford not to.

Fortunately, military medicine isn’t in competition with warfighting priorities such as weapons systems. Rather, it potentiates the ultimate weapons system: the American Soldier, Sailor, Airman, Marine, and Guardian. Medically ready forces keep guns in the fight and ready medical forces honor the pact that America makes to its sons and daughters to provide world-class medical care anytime, anywhere, under any conditions.

The strategy to maintain peak readiness, to cheat the Walker Dip, is three pronged: Support, Sustain, and Strengthen.

We Support our warfighters in battle. This is our raison d’etre.

We Sustain our skills by doing high volume, high complexity medical care.

We Strengthen our chain by fortifying our force generation platforms.

These goals are mutually reinforcing, fostering a virtuous cycle of success. These priorities require resources, leadership, and commitment. I have infinite confidence in the commitment, skill, and dedication of our people. The MHS is one of the best healthcare systems in America and the very best military medical system in the world. We are blessed with outstanding and supportive leaders in the Department who I will continue to work with to ensure the MHS has what it needs. I will continue to tell our story to our elected representatives on Capitol Hill and advocate for our warfighters to ensure they have the medical support they deserve.

Military medicine is a no-fail mission. I’m confident that our success will continue to reinforce the strength that sustains the peace. But should the peace be broken… our preparation will ensure we break the Walker Dip streak.",https://api.army.mil/e2/c/images/2025/06/03/01fa6cc5/max1200.jpg,N,1.0,2025-06-03 19:56:18.013499

Medical logistics personnel can now access critical supplies immediately rather than coordinating off-base transportation, which often caused delays during mission-critical situations.
""I've been on aeromedical evacuation missions where time is vital,"" said U.S. Air Force Capt.
Joint Base Charleston remains dedicated to building its readiness for missions around the world and strengthening its role as a premier power projection platform.","JOINT BASE CHARLESTON, S.C. – A new Consolidated Storage and Distribution Center warehouse is now fully operational at Joint Base Charleston, May 30, 2025.

This facility marks a significant improvement to the base’s medical logistics infrastructure.

The Defense Health Agency partnered with the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers and Naval Facilities Engineering Systems Command to construct the $21.8 million dollar facility, demonstrating the joint-service priority placed on medical logistics modernization.

The new 95,000-square-foot warehouse brings all medical supply functions on-base for the first time. Originally supplies were kept at a difficult to access off-base location with limited space, increasing the chances of security threats and posing logistics challenges.

""This warehouse allows us to respond in hours instead of days,"" said U.S. Air Force Master Sgt. Jacleen Blevins, Charleston CSDC section chief. ""We can respond to everything from a Covid mission to deploying medical teams with supplies immediately accessible on-base.""

Medical logistics personnel can now access critical supplies immediately rather than coordinating off-base transportation, which often caused delays during mission-critical situations.

“Having a state of the art facility on base with our operational assets co-located is a game changer,” said U.S. Air Force Tech Sgt. Timothy Villa, Charleston CSDC medical logistics noncommissioned officer in charge. “We’ve never been better positioned to carry out the Air Force mission anytime, anywhere.”

Joint Base Charleston's C-17 Globemaster III aircraft have the capability to serve as flying hospitals, making this new facility critical to their mission. These large aircraft can transport medical equipment worldwide, but only when supplies are immediately available for deployment.

""I've been on aeromedical evacuation missions where time is vital,"" said U.S. Air Force Capt. Michael Gonzalez, 15th Airlift Squadron C-17 Globemaster III pilot. ""One time we sat on the ground for hours for medication to come in from off-base; all the while, a severely injured soldier was in Iraq, struggling for his life. These are not just glitches in time and logistics, they are life-threatening situations. When the C-17 is fully mission capable as a flying hospital and ready to go, it needs to get airborne in the shortest time possible. Anything longer than that is life threatening.""

Joint Base Charleston remains dedicated to building its readiness for missions around the world and strengthening its role as a premier power projection platform. This new warehouse is designed to play a large role in making that happen today and into the future.",https://d1ldvf68ux039x.cloudfront.net/thumbs/photos/2506/9081414/1000w_q95.jpg,N,0.0,2025-06-03 17:56:27.056249

Depending on your plan, you’ll learn: Steps you need to take if you’re moving within the same TRICARE region or to a different TRICARE region, or if you’re moving to or from the U.S.
Go to Moving and click on the TRICARE plan you had in your old location to learn what to do.
Are you no longer eligible for the TRICARE health plan you had before you moved?
If you have a different TRICARE plan, you can use the Find a Doctor Tool to search for a new provider.","Are you preparing to move to a new location? Now is the best time to make sure your TRICARE benefits are ready to move with you.

“You can use TRICARE wherever you live, but there are actions you can take to help avoid interruptions to your health care and TRICARE benefits,” said Dr. Danita Hunter, chief, TRICARE Health Plan Policy & Programs Branch, at the Defense Health Agency. “Before you move, learn about what these actions are and how your health plan options may change.”

Here’s a TRICARE checklist to help you prepare for your move and what you may need to do after you get to your new location.

Before you move

1. Check out TRICARE’s Moving page.

TRICARE’s Moving page has general information about what do before and after you move. The page also has summaries of what you need to do based on which health plan you’re enrolled in before you move. Depending on your plan, you’ll learn:

Steps you need to take if you’re moving within the same TRICARE region or to a different TRICARE region, or if you’re moving to or from the U.S.

If you’re able to transfer your TRICARE Prime enrollment before you move

No matter which health plan you have, keep these things in mind:

Don’t disenroll from any plan before you move. You’re covered by your current plan on your way to your new location.

Update your address and other contact information in the Defense Enrollment Eligibility Reporting System after you move.

2. Learn how your health plan options might change.

The TRICARE health plans you qualify for may change when you move. For example, your eligibility for TRICARE Prime can change based on who you are and where you move to.

You can use the Plan Finder to see which plans you may qualify for in your new location. Not sure which plan is right for you? You can use the Compare Plans Tool to compare the features of different plans side by side.

Moving is sometimes a TRICARE Qualifying Life Event. Relocation must be to a new country, city, region, or ZIP+4 code to be a QLE. You have 90 days from the date of your address change in DEERS to change your health plan.

3. Get health services and request copies of your health records.

Before you move, catch up on getting your routine care and specialty care, if needed. Be sure to discuss any ongoing health issues and prescriptions with your current primary care manager, primary care provider, or specialist.

Do you have any active referrals? These referrals will still be valid in your new location. (Note: This doesn’t apply if you have an active referral you received with the current referral approval waiver in the West Region.)

Before you move, call the regional contractor for your current location to request your referrals be transferred to the regional contractor for your new location. Your referrals won’t be transferred unless you or your provider requests this. Once you set up your enrollment with your new regional contractor, you can ask the contractor to help you find a provider. The contractor may also be able to help make your first appointment with a new specialist.

If you see any civilian medical or dental providers, be sure to ask for copies of your records to take with you. Talk to your TRICARE contractor for more information on requesting and transferring records.

Are you a service member under permanent change of station orders? Ensure you out-process at your military hospital or clinic. You can also request to transfer your family members’ health records to the military hospital or clinic at your new duty station.

4. Fill prescriptions.

Make sure you have enough of your medication to last during and immediately after your move. Learn more about filling prescriptions.

After you move

1. Update your contact information.

After you move, update your address and contact information in DEERS as soon as possible. Up-to-date DEERS records are vital to accessing your TRICARE benefits. Incorrect addresses can cause issues with eligibility, claims, billing, authorization letters for referrals, and filling prescriptions. Learn how to update your DEERS record.

For many TRICARE plans, you should also update your contact information with the regional contractor for your new location. (If you pay enrollment fees or premiums, it is also a good time to check with your regional contractor to see if you need to make any updates to your payment method.) Go to Moving and click on the TRICARE plan you had in your old location to learn what to do. You don’t need to do this if you have TRICARE For Life, as described in the TRICARE For Life Handbook.

Are you enrolled in the TRICARE Dental Program? You should call the TDP contractor, United Concordia, to update your contact information.

2. Change your health plan within 90 days.

Are you no longer eligible for the TRICARE health plan you had before you moved? If so, you must enroll in a new health plan within 90 days of updating your address in DEERS. If you don’t, you’ll only be eligible for care and pharmacy services at a military hospital or clinic, if space is available. After 90 days, you can only enroll in a plan after another TRICARE QLE or during TRICARE Open Season.

3. Choose a new primary care manager or find a provider.

If you have a TRICARE Prime plan, you may need to choose a new primary care manager.

If you have a different TRICARE plan, you can use the Find a Doctor Tool to search for a new provider. If you’re looking for providers in the U.S., be sure to enter the ZIP code for your new location to make sure you get to the right provider directory.

4. Update your TRICARE Pharmacy Home Delivery mailing address.

Do you get prescriptions through TRICARE Pharmacy Home Delivery? Be sure to update your mailing address with the TRICARE Pharmacy Program contractor, Express Scripts. Keep in mind that there are different rules for using home delivery outside the U.S. and U.S. territories.",https://media.defense.gov/2025/Jun/03/2003731665/1920/1080/0/250603-O-D0202-1001.PNG,N,0.0,2025-06-03 17:56:44.906116

To address this, he said the Department of Defense’s ongoing collaboration with Department of Veterans Affairs, Department of Health and Human Services, and other federal partners remains vital to improving continuity of care for service members.
“We are all focused on a mission that cuts across every sector represented: Delivering smarter, integrated, and data-driven health care for service members, veterans, and their families,” he said.
“This is more than a technical conversation—it’s an operational imperative,” he continued.
“This is the backbone of a connected system that allows service members’ medical history to follow them from basic training to the battlefield and ultimately into the VA EHR system,” Ferrara said.","Interoperability is one of the biggest challenges facing service members and veterans in their lifelong health care experience, Dr. Stephen Ferrara, Acting Assistant Secretary of Defense for Health Affairs, said recently to a group of military and veteran healthcare leaders.

To address this, he said the Department of Defense’s ongoing collaboration with Department of Veterans Affairs, Department of Health and Human Services, and other federal partners remains vital to improving continuity of care for service members. “We are all focused on a mission that cuts across every sector represented: Delivering smarter, integrated, and data-driven health care for service members, veterans, and their families,” he said.

“This is more than a technical conversation—it’s an operational imperative,” he continued. “The nature of warfare is changing. So is the nature of care. From polytrauma and blast injuries to long-term behavioral health challenges and environmental exposure risks, the people we serve need a healthcare system that is resilient, proactive, and agile enough to adapt in real time.”

Addressing the complexities of the MHS, Ferrara stressed, “Our purpose remains constant: To deliver world-class, operationally relevant, and future-ready health care—not just in hospitals and clinics, but on ships, in operational medical units across combat zones, and increasingly in the digital space.”

He talked about the urgency of having “a single, secure electronic health record across all military treatment facilities—one that spans operational, deployed, and garrison environments.”

In 2024, DOD completed a seven-year, multi-billion dollar project to deploy MHS GENESIS at all military hospitals and clinics as the DOD’s single electronic health record. “This is the backbone of a connected system that allows service members’ medical history to follow them from basic training to the battlefield and ultimately into the VA EHR system,” Ferrara said.

MHS GENESIS will ultimately provide a seamless healthcare experience for service members moving from the MHS to the VA by providing “access to their complete clinical history, from battlefield treatment notes to neuroimaging records, and mental health encounters.”

“That is not just a matter of convenience; it is the difference between proactive, effective care and fragmented follow-up. It is also how we ensure that we are supporting the warfighter beyond the battlefield, providing continuity of care that spans service and system boundaries,” said Ferrara.

Ferrara noted three areas of focus to modernize the EHR experience:

Artificial intelligence-powered decision support tools to identify early signs of posttraumatic stress disorder, traumatic brain injuries, and suicide risk

Remote monitoring systems for chronic disease and post-operative care

Expanded virtual health capabilities that allow surgical consultations from deployed hospital units and behavioral health visits from remote duty stations

He said with these capabilities, it would allow the MHS to “deliver care in what is being called the ‘fourth space’ of health care—beyond hospitals, clinics, and home. In this new digital space, information moves faster than geography, connecting care teams and patients across domains, countries, and conflict zones.”

Ferrara said that digital integration is crucial “so we can help our warfighters even when they are in the farthest corners of the globe. Integration helps us maintain clinical currency, train the next generation of military medical professionals, and support real-time care in dynamic environments.”

Taking advantage of the “vast and growing health data available” is vital, he said, by “not just documenting what has happened, but to anticipate what is next. We are now moving from health data collection to data-informed readiness.”

Ferrara discussed the integration of wearable technology to assess “warfighter performance and injury risk,” as an example of how the MHS is leveraging this health data for “real-time tracking of sleep patterns, heart rate variability, and exertion, combined with clinical records, to help flag early indicators of musculoskeletal injury or psychological stress.”

He described how the MHS is leveraging machine-language models to identify potential patterns that may exist and tie into common events experienced by service members, which was previously impossible, such as the individual longitudinal exposure record. “ILER is a critical tool allowing clinicians to access personalized exposure histories at the time of care, while simultaneously supporting population-level research on long-term outcomes like cancer or neurodegenerative disease,” said Ferrara. “The point here is not simply about having data—it’s about building systems that translate data quickly into insight and action, delivering better outcomes at the point of care and across the care continuum.”

He added, “This is how we support the warfighter not just during deployment, but across a lifetime, and how we strengthen our healthcare chain with evidence-based policy, clinical guidance, and surveillance systems that endure.”

Collaborating for the Future

He advocated for the need to create partnerships with government, academia, and domestic and foreign partners to ensure future readiness and healthcare innovation. “None of this work can succeed in silos. Our public-private partnerships are essential—not just for developing new tools, but for testing, scaling, and governing them responsibly,” said Ferrara. “We are deeply engaged with the VA, Health and Human Services, and other federal partners to create interoperable platforms and to help ensure continuity of care across the life of a service member.”

He also noted collaborations with NATO, allied medical forces, and humanitarian organizations “support interoperability during coalition operations and disaster response.”

“Domestically, we rely on civilian trauma partnerships, like the military-civilian partnership for trauma readiness, to certify that our providers remain trained in high-acuity, high-volume trauma care. These partnerships directly improve our operational response to mass casualty incidents and combat situations.”

He emphasized the need for the MHS to be “laser focused on thinking about fighting the next war, not the last war.”

“The mission of the MHS is clear,” he continued, “Deliver a truly integrated, digitally enabled, globally partnered system of readiness and care.”

“It is a future in which data is no longer a barrier, but a bridge. That is the promise of our work. And that is the path we are walking together to support the warfighter, sustain our skills, and strengthen the healthcare chain that unites military, veteran, and civilian care.”",https://dha.mil/-/media/Project/Images/News-Images/8001488.jpg,N,0.0,2025-06-03 14:56:48.051502

“We are all focused on a mission that cuts across every sector represented: Delivering smarter, integrated, and data-driven health care for service members, veterans, and their families,” he said.
“This is the backbone of a connected system that allows service members’ medical history to follow them from basic training to the battlefield and ultimately into the VA EHR system,” Ferrara said.
It is also how we ensure that we are supporting the warfighter beyond the battlefield, providing continuity of care that spans service and system boundaries,” said Ferrara.
And that is the path we are walking together to support the warfighter, sustain our skills, and strengthen the healthcare chain that unites military, veteran, and civilian care.”","Interoperability is one of the biggest challenges facing service members and veterans in their lifelong health care experience, Dr. Stephen Ferrara, Acting Assistant Secretary of Defense for Health Affairs, said recently to a group of military and veteran healthcare leaders.

To address this, he said the Department of Defense’s ongoing collaboration with Department of Veterans Affairs, Department of Health and Human Services, and other federal partners remains vital to improving continuity of care for service members.

“We are all focused on a mission that cuts across every sector represented: Delivering smarter, integrated, and data-driven health care for service members, veterans, and their families,” he said.

“This is more than a technical conversation—it’s an operational imperative,” he continued. “The nature of warfare is changing. So is the nature of care. From polytrauma and blast injuries to long-term behavioral health challenges and environmental exposure risks, the people we serve need a healthcare system that is resilient, proactive, and agile enough to adapt in real time.”

Addressing the complexities of the MHS, Ferrara stressed, “Our purpose remains constant: To deliver world-class, operationally relevant, and future-ready health care—not just in hospitals and clinics, but on ships, in operational medical units across combat zones, and increasingly in the digital space.”

He talked about the urgency of having “a single, secure electronic health record across all military treatment facilities—one that spans operational, deployed, and garrison environments.”

In 2024, DOD completed a seven-year, multi-billion dollar project to deploy MHS GENESIS at all military hospitals and clinics as the DOD’s single electronic health record. “This is the backbone of a connected system that allows service members’ medical history to follow them from basic training to the battlefield and ultimately into the VA EHR system,” Ferrara said.

MHS GENESIS will ultimately provide a seamless healthcare experience for service members moving from the MHS to the VA by providing “access to their complete clinical history, from battlefield treatment notes to neuroimaging records, and mental health encounters.”

“That is not just a matter of convenience; it is the difference between proactive, effective care and fragmented follow-up. It is also how we ensure that we are supporting the warfighter beyond the battlefield, providing continuity of care that spans service and system boundaries,” said Ferrara.

Ferrara noted three areas of focus to modernize the EHR experience:

Artificial intelligence-powered decision support tools to identify early signs of posttraumatic stress disorder, traumatic brain injuries, and suicide risk

Remote monitoring systems for chronic disease and post-operative care

Expanded virtual health capabilities that allow surgical consultations from deployed hospital units and behavioral health visits from remote duty stations

He said with these capabilities, it would allow the MHS to “deliver care in what is being called the ‘fourth space’ of health care—beyond hospitals, clinics, and home. In this new digital space, information moves faster than geography, connecting care teams and patients across domains, countries, and conflict zones.”

Ferrara said that digital integration is crucial “so we can help our warfighters even when they are in the farthest corners of the globe. Integration helps us maintain clinical currency, train the next generation of military medical professionals, and support real-time care in dynamic environments.”

Taking advantage of the “vast and growing health data available” is vital, he said, by “not just documenting what has happened, but to anticipate what is next. We are now moving from health data collection to data-informed readiness.”

A team led by University of Virginia School of Medicine researcher James Stone, MD, PhD, has received $3.2 million from the federal Department of Defense to enhance a critical tool for protecting the brain health of military personnel.

The project aims to upgrade the Generalized Blast Exposure Value (GBEV) tool that assigns a numerical score to a service member’s history of blast exposures that can be used to assess the potential for adverse health outcomes.

“This will represent a major step forward in how the military monitors, protects and cares for its service members,” said Stone, a UVA Health radiologist. “This kind of translational research has the potential to directly inform policy, improve training safety and guide individualized medical decisions for those who serve.”

Understanding Blast Exposures

The project builds on close to two decades of research by Stone and his collaborators that seeks to better understand how repeated exposure to blasts – common in military training and combat – affects the brain over time.

Regular, low-level blast exposures from weapons or breaching, where explosives are used to enter buildings or other structures, can cause cumulative brain injuries and subtle but meaningful changes in brain function. To measure the impact of these blast exposures, Stone has been working with Capt. Stephen Ahlers (retired), PhD, at Naval Medical Research Command to utilize the Blast Exposure Threshold Survey (BETS) and GBEV to link neurological changes to career blast exposures in service members and veterans.

“I’ve had the privilege of working with Dr. Ahlers for more than 18 years, and our collaboration has led to many key contributions in the field of repeated low-level blast exposure. His deep expertise in military brain health research and unwavering commitment to service member health have been instrumental in developing tools like the GBEV,” Stone said. “This continued partnership forms an important foundation for advancing our shared goal of protecting brain health in military populations.”

About the Project

Their latest project will bring together data from more than 16,000 service member assessments across 10 previous research studies, spanning diverse military groups, to refine and strengthen the GBEV tool. The aim is to give the Department of Defense a more precise, data-driven way to identify at-risk individuals, guide protective measures and drive the care that members of the military receive.

“We are also incorporating key members of the Department of Defense public health community – including representatives from the services and the Defense Health Agency – into this effort,” Ahlers said. “By integrating these components, we aim to enhance support for the warfighter, operational units, Department of Defense public health entities and both Department of Defense and Department of Veterans Affairs health providers working to monitor and mitigate the effects of blast exposure on warfighter and veteran health and performance.”

If you notice a teammate struggling, here's how you can help:

Start a private conversation: Let them know you’re concerned and available to listen without judgment. Show empathy and create a safe space for them to share. Sometimes, simply listening and validating their feelings can make a significant difference.

Encourage professional help: Suggest they consider speaking with a Military and Family Life Counselor or a mental health professional. Reassure them that seeking help is a sign of strength.

This year, hurricane season (in the Atlantic and Central Pacific) is expected to last from June 1 to November 30. The Eastern Pacific hurricane season began May 15 and ends November 30. MyCG has assembled some tips and resources to help you and your families prepare for any hurricanes that may come your way. Become familiar with www.ready.gov and the Center for Disease Control’s hurricane guide. Both sites offer preparedness tips as well as how to weather a storm, and what to do upon returning home if you are evacuated.

Prepare

Make sure you know your risk of being impacted by a hurricane. Hurricanes don’t just impact coasts; they can also impact inland areas. If you are in the hurricane track, know how your area may be impacted by high winds, tornados, and/or inland flooding.

Plan

Make sure you have a plan that your family understands. Save relevant emergency phone numbers on your phone and write them down in an accessible place. Map out routes to the closest shelter and sign up for emergency alerts. If you own pets, consider whether you need to locate shelters or friends or family outside of the area who may be able to help in case of an emergency. Don’t forget to charge your phone and any backup batteries/charging pads you have.

Review these key resources before the storm hits:

Prep your car and your go bag

Make sure you have all the essential supplies you and your family will need, including food, water, medicine, personal items, extra batteries, flashlights, and other power sources, a fire extinguisher, and key documents like driver’s licenses or passports.

If you have a car, fill up the tank and make sure your car is in your garage or covered. Leave an emergency kit in your car in case you must leave quickly. If you don’t have a car, think about alternate ways to evacuate, or contact local authorities for more information.

Talk to your family and stay in the loop

Though explaining hurricanes and natural disasters can be scary for children, it is important to make sure you’re all on the same page about your emergency plan. Check news and updates about the storm on TV, the radio, or on your phone at regular intervals to make sure you’re in the know.

You should also consult Ready.gov’s checklist to ensure that you and your family are prepared.

Get ready to stay or evacuate

Always follow instructions from local, state, and national authorities about whether to evacuate.

Col. (P) Osceola M. Evans, was promoted to the rank of Colonel on Friday, April 4, 2025. He has been a Medical Service Corps (MSC) officer since 2003 and is a 73A Licensed Clinical Social Worker. The promotion ceremony, held in Letterman Auditorium at Madigan Army Medical Center, was attended by friends, family, colleagues, and leaders from around the organization and beyond. Brig. Gen. Clinton K. Murray, Commanding General, United States Army Medical Center of Excellence (MEDCoE) and Chief of the U.S Army Medical Corps, presided over the ceremony. The event was filled with honor, tradition, and symbolism.

The promotion ceremony for Col. Evans, named the “U.S. Army’s Social Worker of the Year” in 2022, is a bit poetic. Back in 2011, a then Capt. Evans, after graduating from a first-of-its-kind Master's in Social Work program developed by the Army Medical Department Center and School at Fort Sam Houston, Texas, was a social work intern in the Social Work Internship Program (SWIP) at Madigan Army Medical Center. Ironically, Col. Evans, as Director of BHSL and Director of Psychological Health at Joint Base Lewis-McChord, has had the opportunity to support that same effort in his role as Director of Madigan’s BHSL, which SWIP falls under.

“It’s a full-circle moment for me and my family,” Evans said. “After all these years being back here at JBLM, has been special and I feel honored not only to be entrusted as Director of BHSL, but to continue efforts to improve services and reach more warfighters, their families, and those who need our help. We have an amazing team, and I am honored to provide care alongside such a dedicated team,” said Evans.

Indeed, Madigan’s BHSL has been committed to providing resources for any identified need. Working diligently to erode the stigma surrounding mental health and talking to someone about it. “Madigan's BHSL offers comprehensive mental health services to all service members and their families. These services can be engaged through your primary care manager or, for service members, through your unit’s Embedded Behavioral Health clinic,” Evans added.

During his tenure, Madigan BHSL launched “Targeted Care” in 2024, a new Defense Health Agency initiative that provides a new approach at behavioral health clinics to help improve access to mental health resources. The targeted care model uses a team-based approach to deliver technician-level care to the patient and connects service members with non-clinical and clinical resources, depending on their mental health experience.

“Targeted care helps us give the right mental health support for each individual's specific needs, whether it’s an individual appointment, group therapy or non-clinical support,” Evans said.

“It’s important to note,” he said, “that there are instances where our ability to cope with stressors erodes, despite our efforts. When I was a Behavioral Health Chief, I lost someone close to me to suicide, and I took my own advice to connect with a counselor; it was the wisest thing I could do at the time to help with the grief, In times like those,” he said, “it’s essential to reach out for help, and if you see someone who needs help, please don’t hesitate to connect them as well.”",https://api.army.mil/e2/c/images/2025/06/02/3c30db7b/max1200.jpg,N,0.0,2025-06-02 15:56:32.867012

One of the most common and urgent questions is: Can military insurance cover trauma and PTSD treatment centers?

The short answer is yes. In this blog On Pattison will help you understand what’s covered, how to access it, and what options are available. This can make all the difference in getting the right support.

Understanding Military Insurance Options for Mental Health

Military insurance falls under a few different umbrellas, primarily TRICARE for active-duty personnel and their families, and VA Health Care for veterans. Both programs are designed to support mental health needs, including trauma and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), although the benefits and access points can vary depending on status, location, and provider type. However, there are resources for military and veterans seeking help.

TRICARE is the Department of Defense’s health care program and includes multiple plan types, such as TRICARE Prime, TRICARE Select, and TRICARE Reserve Select. These plans typically offer coverage for therapy, inpatient treatment, outpatient programs, and even residential treatment in some cases.

Veterans who have separated from the military may instead use the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Health Care system, which also includes access to specialized PTSD programs.

Both TRICARE and the VA recognize trauma and PTSD as serious, treatable conditions. Because of this, they provide mental health care coverage that includes a wide range of evidence-based therapies and treatment options—from cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) and EMDR to intensive inpatient care at trauma-focused centers.

What Types of Treatment Centers Are Covered?

When it comes to trauma and PTSD treatment, military insurance may cover different levels of care depending on medical necessity and clinical assessment. This includes:

Outpatient Therapy: Most TRICARE plans and VA Health Care include coverage for outpatient sessions with licensed mental health professionals. This can include individual therapy, group therapy, and medication management. For many, outpatient care is a first step in addressing trauma-related symptoms.

Intensive Outpatient Programs (IOP) and Partial Hospitalization Programs (PHP): If outpatient therapy isn’t enough, military insurance may also cover more structured programming like IOPs or PHPs. These programs offer a higher frequency of care without requiring overnight stays and can be especially helpful for managing severe symptoms while maintaining daily responsibilities.

Residential Treatment Centers: In cases where a higher level of care is required, TRICARE and the VA can approve residential treatment for PTSD and trauma. These programs offer 24/7 therapeutic support in a structured setting and are often recommended for individuals who are at risk of self-harm, struggling with co-occurring disorders, or have not responded to outpatient treatment.

Inpatient Psychiatric Care: For crisis situations, both TRICARE and the VA provide coverage for inpatient hospitalization. This level of care is appropriate for acute episodes of PTSD, severe anxiety, suicidal ideation, or substance use that has become life-threatening.

Specialized PTSD Programs: The VA in particular offers a variety of nationally recognized trauma and PTSD programs. These may include inpatient trauma recovery programs (TRPs), women’s trauma recovery programs, and military sexual trauma (MST) specific care.

Many of these centers are designed to treat veterans with complex trauma histories and are staffed by professionals trained specifically in combat-related and service-related PTSD.

How to Use TRICARE for PTSD and Trauma Treatment

If you or a loved one has TRICARE coverage, using TRICARE insurance coverage for trauma treatment involves a few necessary steps. First, it’s important to determine whether the provider or facility you’re considering is TRICARE-authorized. Not all treatment centers accept TRICARE, but many high-quality trauma treatment centers do.

For active-duty service members, a referral from a primary care manager (PCM) is typically required before starting any specialty mental health care, especially residential treatment or intensive outpatient services.

Dependents and retirees using TRICARE Select may have more flexibility and might not need a referral for outpatient therapy, but prior authorization is still often needed for higher levels of care.

TRICARE also requires that services be deemed medically necessary. This means a licensed provider must assess and document the need for care, such as a diagnosis of PTSD or a history of trauma impacting daily functioning. Once authorized, coverage generally includes therapy sessions, psychiatric consultations, medication, and other approved services.

How the VA Covers Trauma and PTSD Treatment

For veterans, the VA offers some of the most comprehensive PTSD-specific treatment resources available. Coverage is provided through the VA Health Care System, and eligibility is based on factors like service history, discharge status, and whether the condition is service-connected.

The VA's services can include outpatient care at local VA clinics, inpatient care at VA hospitals or affiliated trauma recovery centers, and telehealth for veterans living in rural or underserved areas. Veterans can also access Vet Centers, which offer free readjustment counseling without the need for service-connected disability status.

One of the benefits of using VA Health Care for PTSD treatment is access to providers who specialize in military trauma. Many VA programs are tailored specifically for combat veterans, survivors of military sexual trauma, and those dealing with complex post-traumatic stress that may not be well understood in civilian settings.

Can You Use Both TRICARE and VA Benefits?

In some situations, veterans may qualify for both TRICARE and VA benefits. For example, a retiree who also qualifies for VA care might have the option to choose between systems depending on their needs, wait times, or preferred providers. Coordination of benefits is possible, but it often requires careful management to ensure there’s no duplication of services or billing conflicts.

In general, mental health care is not covered by both programs for the same service on the same day. That means someone could use TRICARE for residential treatment and VA services for outpatient follow-up, but not both simultaneously for the same level of care.

It’s always best to check with both TRICARE and the VA to understand how benefits may be coordinated for long-term treatment planning.

What to Look for in a Trauma or PTSD Treatment Center That Accepts Military Insurance

If you’re searching for a treatment center that accepts military insurance, consider looking for a few key features. First, confirm whether the facility is in-network with TRICARE or approved to accept VA referrals. Ask whether the staff includes professionals experienced in treating veterans and military families, and whether the program uses evidence-based therapies like EMDR, prolonged exposure therapy, or trauma-informed care.

Also consider the environment and program structure. Some individuals benefit from gender-specific care, peer support groups with other veterans, or facilities that offer both mental health and substance use treatment for co-occurring issues.

Make sure the center performs an individualized assessment to determine the right level of care based on symptoms, history, and goals.

Finally, ask about aftercare planning. Whether you’re transitioning from inpatient to outpatient or moving from residential to VA follow-up, a good program should provide a clear plan for continued healing, support groups, and medication management.

Accessing Care When You’re in Crisis

If you or someone you care about is in a mental health crisis and needs immediate support, both TRICARE and the VA offer emergency psychiatric care. TRICARE members can go to the nearest emergency room for mental health emergencies without prior authorization.

The VA has crisis lines, same-day mental health appointments at many locations, and crisis stabilization programs across the country.

No one should have to suffer in silence or wait months for support. Military insurance is designed to help cover the cost of care for trauma and PTSD, so you can focus on healing instead of navigating the system alone.

Move Forward with Confidence And Care

PTSD and trauma don’t define your future. With the right care, recovery is possible. Whether you’re active duty, a veteran, or a family member, understanding how military insurance works for trauma treatment is the first step toward lasting healing.

TRICARE and the VA provide more options than many people realize, including access to some of the best trauma-informed treatment centers in the country.

If you’re unsure where to start, reach out to a treatment center that specializes in trauma care and accepts military insurance. Their admissions team can help guide you through verification, authorizations, and referrals—so you can focus on what really matters: taking the next step toward recovery.

Whether you’ve served for years or are just transitioning to civilian life, you deserve compassionate, expert care. And military insurance can help make that care possible.",,N,0.0,2025-06-02 15:56:38.150466

The good news is that both VA and TRICARE insurance plans do cover a wide range of addiction treatment services.

However, navigating these systems and understanding what’s available, what’s covered, and how to access it can be overwhelming without guidance.

Whether you're seeking care for yourself or a loved one, we at Breaking AC are here to help you understand the scope of your benefits and open the door to effective and compassionate care.

Understanding the Basics: VA and TRICARE Coverage

The Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) and TRICARE serve different populations within the military community, but both provide access to addiction treatment services. The VA primarily covers veterans, while TRICARE is a health care program available to active-duty service members, retirees, and their families. Both plans recognize substance use disorder (SUD) as a medical condition deserving of professional care, and each offers structured pathways to receive help.

TRICARE plans vary depending on your beneficiary category and whether you’re on active duty, retired, or a dependent. Options like TRICARE Prime, TRICARE Select, and TRICARE for Life each have unique structures, referral requirements, and covered services. Meanwhile, VA health care provides addiction treatment services through its Veterans Health Administration network, often at VA Medical Centers or affiliated outpatient clinics.

Addiction Treatment Services Covered by VA Insurance

The VA offers a comprehensive approach to treating substance use disorders. Services typically include medical detox, outpatient and inpatient rehab, medication-assisted treatment (MAT), dual diagnosis treatment for co-occurring mental health disorders, and aftercare planning.

Detox is often the first step, helping veterans safely manage withdrawal symptoms under medical supervision. Once stabilized, patients may transition into inpatient or outpatient treatment depending on the severity of the addiction and other medical needs. MAT, including medications like Suboxone or Vivitrol, may be offered alongside therapy to reduce cravings and support long-term recovery.

Veterans with co-occurring conditions such as PTSD or depression receive integrated care. Dual diagnosis treatment is vital, as substance abuse and mental health disorders often feed into one another. The VA prioritizes this kind of holistic care, recognizing the complex challenges many veterans face upon returning to civilian life.

Addiction Treatment Services Covered by TRICARE

TRICARE provides a robust framework for addiction treatment as well, covering everything from emergency detox to long-term rehabilitation. Covered services often include inpatient detoxification, residential treatment programs, partial hospitalization programs (PHP), intensive outpatient programs (IOP), outpatient therapy, and MAT.

The type of care covered can depend on whether the provider is in-network and whether prior authorization or referrals are required. For example, TRICARE Prime typically requires a referral from your Primary Care Manager (PCM), while TRICARE Select may offer more flexibility when choosing providers.

TRICARE also supports behavioral health services for families, including therapy sessions that can help build stronger support systems during recovery. This is especially valuable for service members and dependents dealing with the broader impact of substance use in the household. There is also help for service members with drunk driving charges.

Key Differences Between VA and TRICARE

While both systems provide access to addiction treatment, they operate differently. The VA offers care directly through its own network, while TRICARE relies on civilian providers who are either in-network or TRICARE-authorized. This distinction can impact wait times, access to specialized services, and overall treatment experience.

Another key difference is eligibility. VA health care is only available to veterans who meet specific criteria, including discharge status and service-connected conditions. TRICARE eligibility, on the other hand, extends to a broader range of individuals including active-duty members, retirees, and dependents.

Both programs have their strengths. The VA may offer a more veteran-centered approach with staff experienced in treating service-related trauma, while TRICARE can provide faster access to care in areas without nearby VA facilities by leveraging civilian treatment centers.

Accessing Addiction Treatment Through the VA

If you're a veteran, the first step is to ensure you're enrolled in the VA health care system. Once enrolled, you can request a screening for substance use and mental health concerns through your primary care team or directly through a VA mental health clinic.

VA addiction treatment is typically provided at VA Medical Centers, community-based outpatient clinics, or specialized residential rehab facilities. Many of these centers also offer telehealth options, making it easier to stay connected to your care team even if you're in a rural or remote location.

For urgent needs, veterans can contact the Veterans Crisis Line or present to their nearest VA Emergency Department for immediate evaluation and possible admission into detox or rehab. From there, treatment teams can help coordinate longer-term recovery plans.

Accessing Addiction Treatment with TRICARE

For TRICARE beneficiaries, accessing treatment starts by understanding your plan's structure and requirements. Active-duty members must go through their Primary Care Manager for a referral, while retirees and dependents under TRICARE Select have more flexibility.

You can search for TRICARE-authorized providers for facilities that accept TRICARE and Humana military plans through the TRICARE website or by calling the regional contractor for your area. When evaluating treatment centers, be sure to ask if they accept TRICARE and whether prior authorization is needed for certain levels of care like residential treatment or detox.

Because TRICARE covers both mental health and substance use disorder treatment, it’s possible to find programs that offer dual diagnosis care and family support services. These integrated approaches often yield better outcomes and reduce the risk of relapse.

Private Rehab Centers That Accept VA or TRICARE

Some private treatment centers are authorized to accept VA or TRICARE patients. These centers may offer specialized amenities or shorter wait times than government-operated facilities. For VA patients, this often requires what's known as Community Care—a program that allows veterans to receive treatment outside the VA system under certain conditions such as long wait times or lack of local VA services.

For TRICARE beneficiaries, using private treatment centers is often more straightforward, provided the facility is in-network or TRICARE-authorized. Many high-quality rehab centers across the country are familiar with TRICARE requirements and can assist with the verification and authorization process.

When choosing a private facility, always verify their experience in treating military populations, especially if PTSD, combat trauma, or military sexual trauma are part of the clinical picture.

Challenges Veterans and Service Members May Face

While coverage is available, navigating the system can be difficult. Veterans may face delays due to high demand at VA facilities, and TRICARE users may struggle with finding in-network options near their home. Paperwork, referral requirements, and lack of clear guidance can also create obstacles.

In rural areas, both VA and TRICARE beneficiaries may find that options are limited. Community-based outpatient clinics can help, but may not offer intensive services like residential treatment. In these cases, telehealth or community care authorizations may bridge the gap.

Stigma is another challenge. Many service members and veterans are hesitant to seek help due to concerns about career repercussions, cultural expectations, or personal pride. Encouraging open conversations and normalizing mental health and addiction support is essential.

The Role of Family in the Recovery Process

Both VA and TRICARE systems recognize the importance of family in the recovery journey. TRICARE, in particular, covers services like family therapy and educational programs for dependents. The VA also offers family-inclusive care and can help loved ones understand the recovery process.

Involving spouses, parents, or children in therapy sessions or recovery planning can strengthen relationships and provide the emotional support needed to sustain sobriety. Family education also reduces the risk of relapse by addressing enabling behaviors and improving communication.

Long-Term Recovery and Aftercare Options

Addiction treatment doesn’t end when rehab is complete. Both VA and TRICARE offer access to long-term recovery support, including outpatient therapy, peer support groups, and medication management. Aftercare planning is a crucial part of any successful recovery strategy.

For veterans, VA medical centers and clinics often provide structured aftercare and relapse prevention programs. Peer specialists—individuals in recovery who are trained to support others—play a vital role in ongoing care.

TRICARE plans may allow for continued therapy, medication-assisted treatment, and support groups. Beneficiaries are encouraged to build a long-term care plan that includes frequent check-ins with providers and participation in ongoing counseling.

Recovery Is Within Reach

The short answer to the question “Is using VA and TRICARE insurance for addiction treatment possible?” is a clear yes. Both systems offer real pathways to recovery, whether you are a veteran, an active-duty service member, or a family member. While the process may require patience and some navigation, the coverage is in place, and help is available.

Recovery is a courageous journey, and using your benefits to get support is a step in the right direction. Whether through VA services, TRICARE-authorized providers, or a combination of both, military members and their families have access to care that honors their service and supports their healing. With the right treatment and support network, long-term recovery is not just possible—it’s entirely within reach.",,N,1.0,2025-06-02 15:56:42.360167

“We are all focused on a mission that cuts across every sector represented: Delivering smarter, integrated, and data-driven health care for service members, veterans, and their families,” he said.
“This is the backbone of a connected system that allows service members’ medical history to follow them from basic training to the battlefield and ultimately into the VA EHR system,” Ferrara said.
It is also how we ensure that we are supporting the warfighter beyond the battlefield, providing continuity of care that spans service and system boundaries,” said Ferrara.
And that is the path we are walking together to support the warfighter, sustain our skills, and strengthen the healthcare chain that unites military, veteran, and civilian care.”","Interoperability is one of the biggest challenges facing service members and veterans in their lifelong health care experience, Dr. Stephen Ferrara, Acting Assistant Secretary of Defense for Health Affairs, said recently to a group of military and veteran healthcare leaders.

To address this, he said the Department of Defense’s ongoing collaboration with Department of Veterans Affairs, Department of Health and Human Services, and other federal partners remains vital to improving continuity of care for service members.

“We are all focused on a mission that cuts across every sector represented: Delivering smarter, integrated, and data-driven health care for service members, veterans, and their families,” he said.

“This is more than a technical conversation—it’s an operational imperative,” he continued. “The nature of warfare is changing. So is the nature of care. From polytrauma and blast injuries to long-term behavioral health challenges and environmental exposure risks, the people we serve need a healthcare system that is resilient, proactive, and agile enough to adapt in real time.”

Addressing the complexities of the MHS, Ferrara stressed, “Our purpose remains constant: To deliver world-class, operationally relevant, and future-ready health care—not just in hospitals and clinics, but on ships, in operational medical units across combat zones, and increasingly in the digital space.”

He talked about the urgency of having “a single, secure electronic health record across all military treatment facilities—one that spans operational, deployed, and garrison environments.”

In 2024, DOD completed a seven-year, multi-billion dollar project to deploy MHS GENESIS at all military hospitals and clinics as the DOD’s single electronic health record. “This is the backbone of a connected system that allows service members’ medical history to follow them from basic training to the battlefield and ultimately into the VA EHR system,” Ferrara said.

MHS GENESIS will ultimately provide a seamless healthcare experience for service members moving from the MHS to the VA by providing “access to their complete clinical history, from battlefield treatment notes to neuroimaging records, and mental health encounters.”

“That is not just a matter of convenience; it is the difference between proactive, effective care and fragmented follow-up. It is also how we ensure that we are supporting the warfighter beyond the battlefield, providing continuity of care that spans service and system boundaries,” said Ferrara.

Ferrara noted three areas of focus to modernize the EHR experience:

• Artificial intelligence-powered decision support tools to identify early signs of posttraumatic stress disorder, traumatic brain injuries, and suicide risk

• Remote monitoring systems for chronic disease and post-operative care

• Expanded virtual health capabilities that allow surgical consultations from deployed hospital units and behavioral health visits from remote duty stations

He said with these capabilities, it would allow the MHS to “deliver care in what is being called the ‘fourth space’ of health care—beyond hospitals, clinics, and home. In this new digital space, information moves faster than geography, connecting care teams and patients across domains, countries, and conflict zones.”

Ferrara said that digital integration is crucial “so we can help our warfighters even when they are in the farthest corners of the globe. Integration helps us maintain clinical currency, train the next generation of military medical professionals, and support real-time care in dynamic environments.”

Taking advantage of the “vast and growing health data available” is vital, he said, by “not just documenting what has happened, but to anticipate what is next. We are now moving from health data collection to data-informed readiness.”

Ferrara discussed the integration of wearable technology to assess “warfighter performance and injury risk,” as an example of how the MHS is leveraging this health data for “real-time tracking of sleep patterns, heart rate variability, and exertion, combined with clinical records, to help flag early indicators of musculoskeletal injury or psychological stress.”

He described how the MHS is leveraging machine-language models to identify potential patterns that may exist and tie into common events experienced by service members, which was previously impossible, such as the individual longitudinal exposure record.

“ILER is a critical tool allowing clinicians to access personalized exposure histories at the time of care, while simultaneously supporting population-level research on long-term outcomes like cancer or neurodegenerative disease,” said Ferrara.

“The point here is not simply about having data—it’s about building systems that translate data quickly into insight and action, delivering better outcomes at the point of care and across the care continuum.”

He added, “This is how we support the warfighter not just during deployment, but across a lifetime, and how we strengthen our healthcare chain with evidence-based policy, clinical guidance, and surveillance systems that endure.”

Collaborating for the Future

He advocated for the need to create partnerships with government, academia, and domestic and foreign partners to ensure future readiness and healthcare innovation.

“None of this work can succeed in silos. Our public-private partnerships are essential—not just for developing new tools, but for testing, scaling, and governing them responsibly,” said Ferrara. “We are deeply engaged with the VA, Health and Human Services, and other federal partners to create interoperable platforms and to help ensure continuity of care across the life of a service member.”

He also noted collaborations with NATO, allied medical forces, and humanitarian organizations “support interoperability during coalition operations and disaster response.”

“Domestically, we rely on civilian trauma partnerships, like the military-civilian partnership for trauma readiness, to certify that our providers remain trained in high-acuity, high-volume trauma care. These partnerships directly improve our operational response to mass casualty incidents and combat situations.”

He emphasized the need for the MHS to be “laser focused on thinking about fighting the next war, not the last war.”

“The mission of the MHS is clear,” he continued, “Deliver a truly integrated, digitally enabled, globally partnered system of readiness and care.”

“It is a future in which data is no longer a barrier, but a bridge. That is the promise of our work. And that is the path we are walking together to support the warfighter, sustain our skills, and strengthen the healthcare chain that unites military, veteran, and civilian care.”",https://d1ldvf68ux039x.cloudfront.net/thumbs/photos/2309/8001488/1000w_q95.jpg,N,0.0,2025-06-02 13:56:20.287943

“This opportunity stems from the initiative and vision of Lt. Cmdr.","Naval Medical Center Camp Lejeune promotes a culture of excellence through building great people, leaders, and teams who exemplify clinical excellence, academic distinction, and outstanding leadership across all levels of professional practice.

Major recognition of that excellence came during the 2025 Military Health System Conference in Cleveland, Ohio when Navy Medicine announced that nurses from NMCCL were awarded the MHS Nursing Leadership Excellence Award in all three military categories. Awardees included Navy Cmdr. Reginald Middlebrooks as Senior Officer, Lt. Cmdr. Alainna Crotty as Midgrade Officer, and Lt. j.g. Jesse Brooks as Junior Officer.

According to award criteria, the MHS Nursing Leadership Excellence awards honors military nurses who have “demonstrated exemplary leadership skills and exceptional compassion and commitment to patients, colleagues, and the profession of nursing, resulting in noteworthy clinical or administrative accomplishments and contributing to the improved image and practice of nursing within the Military Health System.”

“Receiving the award is awesome, but it’s less of a reflection of what I did, and more a reflection on the leadership putting me in that position,” said Brooks. “In a culture like this one, I think setting the standard is important, and Cmdr. Middlebrooks and Lt. Cmdr. Crotty are different from other leaders; they engaged me, made suggestions… but in the end, let me make the decisions and run with it. I think that’s something to emulate, and it made an impression on me.”

Crotty mirrored his sentiments citing leadership engagement style as the reason for her success. “Our culture here starts from our senior leaders who allow us to take the opportunities to drive enterprise level change,” said Lt. Cmdr. Alainna Crotty. “I am not given directives; they let me lead and gain experience that I need to move forward. They push us to jump on enterprise level initiatives that really put our names out [into the community].”

In addition to the awards, Middlebrooks, along with Cmdr. Sarah Louk, were selected as fellows in the University of Pennsylvania/Johnson &amp; Johnson Nurse Innovation Fellowship – a first in NMCCL history. “This opportunity stems from the initiative and vision of Lt. Cmdr. Alainna Crotty who led much of the groundwork behind our successful application,” said Middlebrooks. “This fellowship is designed to advance health care and drive transformative change within the organization.”

The fellowship is a combination of in-person and virtual sessions running through May 2026 and will allow the fellows to solve some of health care’s biggest challenges while maintaining an environment that fosters innovation within NMCCL. “Camp Lejeune nurses are not only excelling within the walls of NMCCL but are also shaping policy, leading [Defense Health Agency]-level committees, and earning competitive research funding – securing over $200,000 in grants to advance evidence-based practice,” said Middlebrooks. “Each day, our nurses demonstrate a deep commitment to improving the care for our warfighters and beneficiaries. I believe the recent wave of recognition simply reflects a long-standing culture of excellence that our nurses have worked hard to build.”

Major Change in US Social Security: Millions of Americans Waiting These provisions affected more than 3.2 million Americans, including teachers, police officers, firefighters, and other public employees whose jobs weren't covered by Social Security.
Additionally, the Social Security Administration (SSA) has announced that affected beneficiaries will receive retroactive payments corresponding to the year 2024.
With these adjustments, Social Security in the United States takes an important step toward greater equity and justice for all its beneficiaries.","Social Security in the United States has undergone a historic change that benefits millions of citizens. With the approval of the Social Security Fairness Act (HR82) on January 5, 2025, two federal policies have been eliminated.

These policies, which for decades reduced the benefits of many retirees and disability beneficiaries, are the Windfall Elimination Provision (WEP) and the Government Pension Offset (GPO).

Major Change in US Social Security: Millions of Americans Waiting

These provisions affected more than 3.2 million Americans, including teachers, police officers, firefighters, and other public employees whose jobs weren't covered by Social Security. With the repeal of WEP and GPO, these citizens can now receive their full monthly benefits.

Additionally, the Social Security Administration (SSA) has announced that affected beneficiaries will receive retroactive payments corresponding to the year 2024. On average, these one-time payments amount to $6,710, totaling $7.5 billion distributed to more than one million people.

Benefits for These Americans Increase: Take Note of the SSA

The increases in monthly benefits are also significant. According to estimates from the Congressional Budget Office, those affected by WEP will receive an average increase of $360 per month, while those impacted by GPO will see increases ranging from $700 to $1,190 per month.

To implement these changes, the SSA has used automated systems that speed up the delivery of payments. Although some complex cases require manual processing, most beneficiaries have already started receiving their retroactive payments. They will see the increases reflected in their monthly benefits starting in April.

The SSA Wants to Avoid Errors and Make the Reimbursement Process Easier

In addition to these changes, the SSA has adjusted its overpayment recovery policy. Previously, beneficiaries who received excess payments had to return the full amount, which caused financial difficulties. Now, the SSA has implemented measures to avoid these errors and make the reimbursement process easier, including detailed notifications and appeal options.

American citizens have welcomed these changes enthusiastically. Many believe that the repeal of WEP and GPO corrects a historic injustice and provides greater financial security to those who have dedicated their lives to public service. With these adjustments, Social Security in the United States takes an important step toward greater equity and justice for all its beneficiaries.",https://elcierredigital.com/filesedc/uploads/image/post/montaje-de-fotos-dolares-sorpresa-fondo-eeuu_1200_800.webp,N,0.0,2025-06-02 15:56:48.807654

Wendy Council, a work-life specialist at JBSA’s M&FRC, spoke on the panel and reflected on how much support from fellow spouses meant to her early on in her marriage to a servicemember.

“We got married—I was 19—so it was my first time away from home,” Council said. “I was clinging to something that was what I saw as wiser. I was looking to the other spouses who had been through it. They knew more about it. I didn’t have a mom, mother-in-law, no one else around.”

For Brianna Kerber, who attended Heart Link for the first time, the event demonstrated how engaged the M&FRC staff are in supporting spouses.

“It was nice to know that the Readiness Center staff are getting involved with other programs. It’s good to make connections and do all the networking.”

The session also addressed financial readiness. Richard Gomez, M&FRC community readiness consultant—personal finance, explained how small administrative oversights on the LES can cost families significant amounts over time.

“We find service members still marked as single on their LES even though they’re married with kids,” Gomez said. “That’s money lost every month. Fixing that one line can mean hundreds of dollars back in your pocket.”

Although the funds can often be recovered later—such as during tax season—Gomez stressed the importance of making timely corrections to ensure families receive their full entitled monthly pay.

Heart Link is just one of many programs offered through the JBSA M&FRC, which supports active-duty service members, National Guard personnel, Reserve forces, retirees, surviving spouses, and DOD civilians. As part of the centers, operated by the 502nd Air Base Wing and the 802nd Force Support Squadron, provide one-on-one consultations, workshops, and briefings covering everything from employment and relocation to deployment support, volunteer opportunities, and transition assistance.

The goal of the program is to strengthen military families by connecting them with the resources, people, and knowledge they need to thrive.

Thanks to Obamacare, eligible individuals who otherwise can’t get affordable coverage through their employers can purchase coverage from the marketplace and qualify for the PTC to reduce their monthly premiums. People who can get affordable health coverage through their employers don't qualify for the PTC, nor do individuals who are eligible for Medicare, Tricare, Medicaid or other federal health insurance programs.

Temporary PTC easings are ending

Prior to 2021, the PTC was available only to people with modified adjusted gross incomes (AGI) ranging from 100% to 400% of the federal poverty guidelines, who bought insurance through the marketplace, such as on healthcare.gov, and who met certain other rules. Modified AGI for this purpose is your AGI plus tax-free interest, nontaxable Social Security benefits and tax-exempt foreign earned income.

During the height of the COVID-19 pandemic, federal lawmakers enhanced the PTC for 2021 and 2022, letting more people qualify for the subsidy. Congress also increased the credit amount for many qualifying individuals. Lawmakers later renewed these enhancements, but made them temporary through 2025.

For 2025, individuals with modified AGI over 400% of the federal federal poverty level will qualify for the PTC to the extent that the cost of the benchmark silver plan on the marketplace exceeds 8.5% of their income.

However, beginning in 2026, the rules revert to those that were in place for pre-2021 years, so that only individuals with modified AGI between 100% and 400% of the poverty level will get PTCs. That means that fewer people will qualify for the PTC. Also, the credit amounts for most everyone else who would still qualify for PTCs will be much lower than before, meaning individuals would be paying higher premiums for health insurance.

This will begin to impact people seeking marketplace coverage for 2026 on healthcare.gov later this fall, unless Congress acts to extend the PTC easings. And the impact will continue to be felt for each year thereafter. Letting the PTC enhancements lapse could eventually lead to 3.7 million people losing heath insurance each years because they can't afford the monthly premiums. And this is a conservative figure.

Extending the PTC easings isn't a goal of President Trump or of most congressional Republicans. Even while GOP lawmakers in Washington, D.C., are hard at work on a tax deal to extend expiring provisions in the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act and to provide additional tax relief, there is silence on the PTC. The House-passed ""One Big Beautiful"" bill doesn't extend the easings. And though we expect that Senate Republicans will make some changes to the House package, adding PTC relief isn't in the forecast. It's possible that Congress could address PTC relief later on this year in a different tax bill, but that appears to be a longshot.

How does the premium tax credit work?

The PTC is estimated when you go on the marketplace to buy health insurance. The estimated credit for 2026 will be based on your expected 2026 income. To figure this out, you would begin with your 2024 modified AGI and add or substract any expected income changes that you anticipate having for 2026. The lower your modified AGI, the bigger the credit.

Most people who qualify for the PTC will generally elect to have it paid in advance directly to the health insurance company to lower their monthly health insurance premiums. If you opt for this, you must file a federal tax return, even though your income may be below the filing threshold or you expect a refund. You would use IRS Form 8962 to compute the PTC amount, list any advance payments made to the insurer (which you would find on the Form 1095-A that you receive from the health insurance marketplace), and reconcile the two figures. If your PTC exceeds the advance payments, then you can claim the excess PTC on your Form 1040. If the PTC is less than the advances, most people would need to repay part or all of the excess.

Beware of an IRS audit red flag

Erroneous reporting of the PTC on your Form 1040 is an easy red flag for the IRS. Its computers flag filed tax returns showing modified AGIs that exceed the limit to take the PTC. Also, the IRS receives Form 1095-A from the health insurance marketplace that shows which taxpayers have selected to have their PTC paid in advance to reduce monthly premiums, and the amounts of those advance payments. So before you file your Form 1040, double-check that you qualify for the PTC and that you accurately report it.

Also, if you are currently enrolled in marketplace coverage, let the marketplace know of any changes that could affect your 2025 PTC amount. For example, if your lost your job and report lower income, the marketplace will increase the subsidy amount for future months, thus putting more money into your pocket. The exchange will also decrease the subsidy if you report higher income, for example, maybe you sold investment property or you found a new job. Notifying the marketplace now can mitigate surprises when you file your Form 1040 next year.",https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/f9yGJJZ8SdbaYqa4zAYsr8.jpg,N,0.0,2025-06-02 09:56:24.742690

SSA Speaks Clearly: What Is the Compassionate Allowances Program

The Compassionate Allowances program allows for the rapid identification of diseases and medical conditions that clearly meet the disability criteria established by SSA. These conditions include certain types of cancer, adult brain disorders, and rare diseases that affect children.

Due to the severity of these conditions, applications can be approved based solely on medical confirmation of the diagnosis. All of this, without the need for additional documentation.

Identification of Diseases and Advanced Technology

SSA uses advanced technology, such as electronic medical records and computerized assessments, to identify possible cases that qualify for the CAL program. This technology allows for a faster and more accurate evaluation of applications, significantly reducing the waiting time for applicants.

The Compassionate Allowances program is crucial for SSA, since it allows them to speed up the disability determination process for people with the most severe conditions. To date, more than one million people with severe disabilities have been approved through this expedited process. Currently, the program includes a total of 287 conditions.

Recent Updates

Recently, SSA has added nine new conditions to the CAL program and has reviewed two existing conditions. Among the new conditions are Bainbridge-Ropers syndrome, Costello syndrome, and medullary renal carcinoma.

These updates reflect SSA's ongoing commitment to improve and expand the program. The Compassionate Allowances program is an essential tool for SSA to provide rapid assistance to people with serious illnesses.

Thanks to the use of advanced technology and the efficient identification of medical conditions, SSA can offer a faster and more effective response to those who need it most.
