According to Podmanik, her husband Ed had repeatedly informed SSA that he had returned to work, but the agency kept sending him benefits.

The agency is demanding the return of $69,087.50 for overpayments related to benefits her late husband, Ed, received before passing away in 2012 due to leukemia. According to Podmanik, her husband Ed had repeatedly informed SSA that he had returned to work, but the agency kept sending him benefits.

Pensioner is forced to return nearly $70,000 to US SSA: she's outraged

Years later, upon retiring and beginning to claim the benefits corresponding to her husband, Ruth was informed that she had to return the full amount. Amid fears of losing her home, she emphasizes that the error was SSA's and not hers or her husband's.

This case has caused outrage and has exposed SSA's practices regarding the recovery of overpayments. The agency has been criticized for the measures they take against beneficiaries who received improper payments, many of whom are not at fault and can't afford to return the money. Recently, SSA announced actions to address the problem of overpayments and the associated injustices.

This may not be enough for people like Ruth Podmanik

Among the measures adopted, the SSA has reduced the automatic overpayment recovery rate to 10% of the monthly benefit, instead of the 100% that was previously applied. In addition, the agency has made it easier to request recovery waivers for those who are not at fault or can't return the money.

However, these measures may not be enough for people like Ruth Podmanik, who are facing significant debts due to administrative errors. SSA has stated that they are working to ensure that their overpayment recovery policies are fair and equitable, and that they do not unduly harm beneficiaries.

The Ohio pensioner still trusts SSA will acknowledge their error

Ruth's case has drawn media attention and sparked a debate about SSA's responsibility in managing benefits. Many are questioning how it is possible that administrative errors can have such serious consequences for people who depend on these benefits to survive.

Meanwhile, Ruth Podmanik is waiting for a favorable resolution to her situation. She trusts SSA will acknowledge their error and allow her to keep her home and financial stability.",https://elcierredigital.com/filesedc/uploads/image/post/montaje-donald-trump-sujetando-dolares-en-oficina-seguridad-social_1200_800.webp,N,0.0,2025-05-30 16:56:30.996444

Middlebrooks and Lt. Cmdr.
“Our culture here starts from our senior leaders who allow us to take the opportunities to drive enterprise level change,” said Lt. Cmdr.
“This opportunity stems from the initiative and vision of Lt. Cmdr.","Naval Medical Center Camp Lejeune promotes a culture of excellence through building great people, leaders, and teams who exemplify clinical excellence, academic distinction, and outstanding leadership across all levels of professional practice.

Major recognition of that excellence came during the 2025 Military Health System Conference in Cleveland, Ohio when Navy Medicine announced that nurses from NMCCL were awarded the MHS Nursing Leadership Excellence Award in all three military categories. Awardees included Navy Cmdr. Reginald Middlebrooks as Senior Officer, Lt. Cmdr. Alainna Crotty as Midgrade Officer, and Lt. j.g. Jesse Brooks as Junior Officer.

According to award criteria, the MHS Nursing Leadership Excellence awards honors military nurses who have “demonstrated exemplary leadership skills and exceptional compassion and commitment to patients, colleagues, and the profession of nursing, resulting in noteworthy clinical or administrative accomplishments and contributing to the improved image and practice of nursing within the Military Health System.”

“Receiving the award is awesome, but it’s less of a reflection of what I did, and more a reflection on the leadership putting me in that position,” said Brooks. “In a culture like this one, I think setting the standard is important, and Cmdr. Middlebrooks and Lt. Cmdr. Crotty are different from other leaders; they engaged me, made suggestions… but in the end, let me make the decisions and run with it. I think that’s something to emulate, and it made an impression on me.”

Crotty mirrored his sentiments citing leadership engagement style as the reason for her success.

“Our culture here starts from our senior leaders who allow us to take the opportunities to drive enterprise level change,” said Lt. Cmdr. Alainna Crotty. “I am not given directives; they let me lead and gain experience that I need to move forward. They push us to jump on enterprise level initiatives that really put our names out [into the community].”

In addition to the awards, Middlebrooks, along with Cmdr. Sarah Louk, were selected as fellows in the University of Pennsylvania/Johnson & Johnson Nurse Innovation Fellowship – a first in NMCCL history.

“This opportunity stems from the initiative and vision of Lt. Cmdr. Alainna Crotty who led much of the groundwork behind our successful application,” said Middlebrooks. “This fellowship is designed to advance health care and drive transformative change within the organization.”

The fellowship is a combination of in-person and virtual sessions running through May 2026 and will allow the fellows to solve some of health care’s biggest challenges while maintaining an environment that fosters innovation within NMCCL.

“Camp Lejeune nurses are not only excelling within the walls of NMCCL but are also shaping policy, leading [Defense Health Agency]-level committees, and earning competitive research funding – securing over $200,000 in grants to advance evidence-based practice,” said Middlebrooks. “Each day, our nurses demonstrate a deep commitment to improving the care for our warfighters and beneficiaries. I believe the recent wave of recognition simply reflects a long-standing culture of excellence that our nurses have worked hard to build.”

NMCCL has provided more than 80 years of dedicated, passionate care for warfighters and beneficiaries at Marine Corps Base Camp Lejeune.",https://d1ldvf68ux039x.cloudfront.net/thumbs/photos/2505/9072528/1000w_q95.jpg,N,0.0,2025-05-30 16:56:37.994038

My Social Security benefits will not pay for my mandatory Medicare because I can’t start collecting full Social Security benefits until I’m 67!
And, since you are not yet collecting Social Security, you will be required to separately pay the Medicare Part B premium directly to Medicare (they will bill you when you enroll in Medicare).
So, is it unfair that you must pay for Medicare Part B before you are collecting Social Security?
You can visit this site to see how to pay your Medicare premiums until it is later deducted from your Social Security payment: www.medicare.gov/basics/costs/pay-premiums/online-bill-pay.","DEAR RUSTY: I’m a retired Navy veteran who is going to be turning 65 years old this year. My question is concerning mandatory Medicare sign-up requirements. Why do I have to sign up for Medicare coverage at 65 when I can’t start collecting full Social Security benefits until I turn 67? My Social Security benefits will not pay for my mandatory Medicare because I can’t start collecting full Social Security benefits until I’m 67!

I currently pay for Tricare and utilize my local Veterans Administration medical facilities and referrals for my healthcare. With me turning 65 and having to wait until I’m 67 for my full Social Security benefits, it just seems unfair that I’ll have to pay out-of-pocket Medicare monthly expenses for two years! Is there any way to avoid this unfair penalty? — Retired Navy Vet

DEAR RETIRED NAVY VET: First, I want to thank you for your military service to our country. Please know that here at the AMAC Foundation we care a lot about our veterans, and you may find the “For Veterans” section of our Foundation website interesting (amacfoundation.org).

Regarding your question, you should be aware that enrolling in Medicare is not mandatory, but there are consequences if you do not enroll when you become eligible (normally at age 65). For one thing, if you are a retired veteran on military TriCare, you will lose your TriCare benefits if you don’t enroll in Medicare when you are eligible (TriCare requires that you enroll in Medicare when eligible). And, since you are not yet collecting Social Security, you will be required to separately pay the Medicare Part B premium directly to Medicare (they will bill you when you enroll in Medicare).

Another potential consequence is that if you do not enroll in Medicare Part B when you are first eligible, you may incur a lifetime late enrollment penalty for enrolling in Part B later.

Something else to keep in mind is that there are two “parts” to Medicare — Part A (which is coverage for inpatient hospitalization services), and Part B, which is coverage for outpatient healthcare services (doctors, medical tests, etc.). Medicare Part A is free to you, but there is a premium for Medicare Part B ($185/month for 2025). Note that you will need to pay a Part B premium as long as you are enrolled in Medicare Part B (it doesn’t go away after you are collecting Social Security, but it is taken from your Social Security payment).

And there is no way for you to avoid the Part B premium after enrolling, and enrolling in Part B is necessary for you to continue your military TriCare-for-life benefits. Note that Medicare Part A and Part B do not include prescription drug coverage, but your TriCare coverage usually does.

It’s important to note that Medicare and Social Security are two independent senior programs with different eligibility rules. As you may know, you can collect early (reduced) Social Security at age 65 (and have your Medicare Part B premium deducted from your SS payment). But you would be collecting Social Security early and, in addition to a reduced benefit, you would also be subject to Social Security’s annual earnings test if you are still working. The SS earnings test limits how much you can earn before some of your SS benefits are taken away (if you exceed the earning limit prior to your full retirement age).

So, is it unfair that you must pay for Medicare Part B before you are collecting Social Security? Well, I think not, because the two programs are completely independent benefits (the Social Security Administration merely administers Medicare payments as a convenience). Remember, your Medicare Part A is free, but you must pay a premium for Part B, and you must take both to retain your military TriCare-for-Life benefits. You can visit this site to see how to pay your Medicare premiums until it is later deducted from your Social Security payment: www.medicare.gov/basics/costs/pay-premiums/online-bill-pay.

My Military Health—the Defense Health Agency’s new care model—is changing how service members get mental health care by making the experience more convenient and user-friendly.

“My Military Health has rolled out to all Defense Health Agency military hospitals and clinics worldwide with significant potential to enhance patient convenience and expand access to care,” said Dr. Julie Freeman, DHA’s chief strategic innovation officer. “Virtual mental health care is just one of the options offered to patients.”

Studies show the great potential for virtual mental health care to improve access, reduce costs, and enhance patient engagement. Virtual mental health visits see greater adherence to follow through on care plans. Patients often feel like there is less stigma and greater confidentiality if they aren’t seen going to a mental health clinic.

Meet U.S. Air Force Maj. Betsy Trahan

Trahan, a clinical psychologist, works at the 96th Medical Group at Eglin Air Force Base, Florida. Eglin is one of five My Military Health venture sites that are testing new technologies and streamlining processes to enhance the overall patient experience. Trahan helps bring this system to life by working with experts from all military branches to make the program better.

Benefit 1: Getting Care Faster

My Military Health makes it easier for service members to get the help they need when they need it.

""We've seen big improvements in access to care at Eglin,"" Trahan said. “The program gives us more flexibility in how we deliver care and more creative ways to help patients.”

Trahan reported, “New patient appointments have increased by 61% since we started. Before, patients waited about 30 days for mental health care. Now, we can see them in just one week.”

For service members who need mental health care, this shorter wait can make a significant difference.

Benefit 2: Continuity of Care

Military life often means moving or deploying, which too often prevents patients from continuing treatment. My Military Health offers an option to keep care available no matter where service members are stationed.

“Patients can now see their provider when they want to,” said Trahan. She stressed how important it is for patients to “work with a provider who really knows them” and have “flexible options for getting care.”

This steady, consistent support from a team of available providers helps patients build trust in the system. Wherever they are, patients know they can find a provider who knows their history. This care also supports military readiness—the ability of service members to fulfill their mission anywhere in the world.

Mental health is a core component of readiness. My Military Health makes it possible for service members to stay healthy wherever they serve.

Benefit 3: Using Cutting Edge Technology to Support Patients Better

My Military Health uses digital tools like Scheduled Virtual Visits to make health care easy for patients and providers. Scheduled Virtual Visits enables providers to see their patients quickly which can help patients avoid wait times during a mental health episode.

When doctors find patients who can use digital tools for their current needs, they can act right away. As another Eglin team member put it, “If you have the patient on the phone, we can connect them right now through a virtual visit as one way to improve accessibility.”

By adding digital tools to therapy, patients get more complete care in a way that fits their individual needs and schedules.

Benefit 4: Working as a Team to Improve Patient Care

My Military Health helps different types of providers work better together, which Trahan said is a key to success.

“Working as a team has been vital to the program's success,” she explained. “We work with primary care and specialty clinics to learn from each other and coordinate each patient’s level of care. By doing so, we are improving patient care.”

Benefit 5: Improvements in Access and Satisfaction

Eglin is seeing big improvements thanks to My Military Health. Not only has it improved wait times, but patients are coming back to Eglin because they find it easier to connect with providers there.

Trahan acknowledged many other benefits coming to DHA. “Our staff and providers are more satisfied,” which helps address the burnout problem common in military health. She continued, “My Military Health helps providers feel part of positive change.”

Benefit 6: Potential to Change the Game Across the Enterprise

The success at Eglin shows how My Military Health can help DHA better support military readiness through improved mental health care. My Military Health allows providers and service members a flexible way to meet and securely talk about mental health care. It gives patients an opportunity to have conversations in real time to get support whenever and wherever they need it.

“We know mental health is a major concern, and there's limited care available on and off base,"" Trahan said. “We need smart ways to reach patients where they are.”

My Military Health offers exactly this kind of smart solution, balancing better access with provider well-being. Trahan said this as an ongoing effort, “This is a continuing project. We keep finding new ways to help our staff and patients thrive.”",https://dha.mil/-/media/Project/Images/News-Images/9068085.jpg,N,1.0,2025-05-30 15:56:21.919182

While the young prince takes on new challenges, the royal family seeks to keep unity and overcome adversity.","The new generations of European royal houses are beginning to take center stage. In Norway, the youngest son of Prince Haakon and Princess Mette-Marit, Sverre Magnus, has just carried out his first solo engagement with great success. This participation was not only highlighted in his country, but it also sparked interest in international media, amid a challenging time for the royal family.

A Desired and Very Well Received Debut

On May 27, Sverre Magnus welcomed Norwegian athletes and all the staff who participated in the Special Olympics World Games in Turin at an official reception. The young prince's presence was described as confident and natural. ""He was smiling and talkative, and said he was happy to be here,"" Norwegian media reported.

Caroline Vagle, a royalty expert, especially valued the way he interacted with the athletes: ""He's really good at talking with them, he asks questions, tells jokes, and creates a relaxed atmosphere. He was literally born for this."" From France, the press was impressed by his bearing and height, noting that ""he's at least two heads taller than the others.""

The Norwegian Royal Family and Their Current Challenges

While Sverre Magnus is gaining prominence, the royal family is facing delicate situations. His older sister, Ingrid Alexandra, has started her studies in social sciences with a specialization in international relations and political economy, far from home, at the University of Sydney. Another chapter of the Norwegian Royal House is the scandal involving Marius Borg Høiby, Mette-Marit's eldest son from a previous relationship.

Marius Borg was detained in August 2024 and faced serious charges that led to a week of preventive detention. The young man admitted to addiction problems and underwent treatment at a specialized clinic in London. Family members have acknowledged that they're going through a difficult time; Princess Mette-Marit herself commented that ""it's been very, very hard for us.""

Mette-Marit's Health Also Raises Concerns

In addition to the family crisis, Mette-Marit is suffering a worsening of her chronic lung disease and this problem has forced her to cancel several public appearances. In March, the palace confirmed that the princess is experiencing ""daily symptoms and ailments"" that affect her official duties. ""She needs more rest and her daily routine is changing more quickly than before,"" they noted.

This difficult context contrasts with the growing confidence and maturity Sverre Magnus is showing in his first public steps.

But Ryder’s responsibilities stretch far beyond health care administration.
In her role as commander of Medical Readiness Command Bravo, she prepares Air Force medical teams for deployment to conflict zones around the world.
It was also at BC that Ryder met an Air Force recruiter who offered her an intensive six-month obstetrics internship as part of her enlistment.
For instance, today her charge includes providing medical care at some of the most highly classified workplaces in the country: United States Space Force installations, where military and civilian personnel monitor satellites and cybersecurity, among other duties.","On the evening of September 11, 2001, as much of the nation sat stunned and weeping before television screens, Major General Jeannine Ryder—then a young Air Force captain—received a call that would test her mettle in a time of crisis. Her commander summoned her to Dover Air Force Base, home to the US military’s largest mortuary, where she was to lead a team of medics in the duty of identifying victims of the attack on the Pentagon. With Americans still reeling from the deadliest terrorist attack on domestic soil, Ryder marshaled her team, guided them in grief through their urgent responsibility, and fulfilled the crucial mission of the moment. The weight of the experience set a course for the rest of her life. “I knew from then on,” Ryder said, “that my job was to save every casualty we could.”

It’s this combination of commitment, compassion, and resolve that has defined Ryder’s thirty-four-year military career, in which, among many other positions, she has previously served as chief nurse of the Air Force Nurse Corps. Today, Ryder occupies two of the most critical health care leadership roles in the United States military. As director of Defense Health Network Continental, she oversees a $1.1 billion budget and twenty-six military hospitals and clinics across the country that care for more than half a million patients, including active duty service members and veterans. But Ryder’s responsibilities stretch far beyond health care administration. In her role as commander of Medical Readiness Command Bravo, she prepares Air Force medical teams for deployment to conflict zones around the world. As global tensions rise and conflicts grow more complex, Ryder’s job is to ensure that military medical personnel—including doctors, medics, and lab technicians—are ready to respond however needed, whether that means performing air evacuations, responding to emergencies in flying intensive care units, or delivering lifesaving care on the ground under the most extreme conditions. “It’s about organizing, training, and equipping, to make sure that we have the right force for the next fight,” Ryder said, speaking from the Defense Health Agency headquarters just outside of Washington, DC. “When our medical personnel step off the plane, they need to be ready.”

Ryder said she was instilled with a strong sense of responsibility and caring for others while growing up in Pittsfield, Massachusetts. Her father, a high school principal, would show up early to greet teachers and students, while her grandfather, a first-generation Italian American and state legislator, cared for Ryder’s grandmother, a former nurse, after a debilitating stroke.

At Boston College, where she studied nursing, Ryder found a community that shared her values of hard work and integrity. “The instructors didn’t coddle us. We had hard clinical assignments,” she recalled of her training at local hospitals. It was also at BC that Ryder met an Air Force recruiter who offered her an intensive six-month obstetrics internship as part of her enlistment. “I wanted to gain clinical experience and grow as an independent person,” said Ryder, who took her enlistment oath in the living room of her six-person BC Mod, number 37A, on the morning of the Commencement Ball. “There was a crew of us there to support her,” recalled Patty Leyden Paul, Ryder’s then-roommate and a close friend today. Paul said Ryder, besides being a fun and supportive friend, was already showing leadership qualities. She was the one who woke up before everybody else to exercise, head to work, or study, Paul said. “There was a maturity to her. She was your wing woman.”

At the end of her Air Force internship—and after marrying her husband, Terry, with whom she now has three children—Ryder was deployed to Germany, where she quickly distinguished herself in a high-volume maternity ward. It wound up being the first stop in a long and successful career. Ryder has received two dozen assignments, including deployments to command medical operations in Southwest Asia and Afghanistan during Operation Enduring Freedom, which followed the 9/11 attacks. She was part of the first medical evacuation piloted by American-trained Afghans, and earned a Bronze Medal, awarded for achievement in combat zones.Her success was no surprise, said Lieutenant Colonel Kathy Conrad, who oversaw Ryder’s Air Force recruitment. “I knew even then—this woman was going places,” Conrad said. “She can be tough, and she’s not afraid to confront people who aren’t doing the right thing. But she’s also understanding and an excellent communicator.”

Ryder’s responsibilities have evolved along with the world and the military. For instance, today her charge includes providing medical care at some of the most highly classified workplaces in the country: United States Space Force installations, where military and civilian personnel monitor satellites and cybersecurity, among other duties. Ryder, a marathoner, said her greatest professional challenge is staying two steps ahead. What will global conflicts look like in the future, and what tools and training will medics need to respond? To prepare, she’s championing new training technologies, such as virtual reality simulations, and the development of enhanced equipment and supplies to support the agility of the Air Force’s mobile medical teams.The responsibility is great, but Ryder said it’s nothing compared with serving her country and saving the lives of those who protect it. “We have,” she said, “the best job in the world.”",http://bc.edu,N,0.0,2025-05-30 06:56:19.741999

What You Need to Know: CMS is now accepting 2025 MIPS hardship and exception applications, with expanded eligibility that allows physicians to request exemptions from the Cost performance category and administrative claims-based measures. Practices facing disruptions—such as cyberattacks or EHR issues—can apply through Dec. 31, 2025, to avoid penalties.

The Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) recently opened the 2025 Merit-based Incentive Payment System (MIPS) Extreme and Uncontrollable Circumstances (EUC) Exception and Promoting Interoperability (PI) Hardship Exception applications. Notably, CMS has expanded eligibility criteria to allow exemptions from the Cost performance category and administrative claims-based measures, providing significant relief for practices facing operational disruptions for an extended period, for example due to a cyberattack.

Individual clinicians, groups and virtual groups can submit a MIPS EUC exception application for one or more MIPS performance category (quality, cost, improvement activities, and Promoting Interoperability) due to extreme and uncontrollable circumstances for the 2025 MIPS performance period now through Dec. 31, 2025, at 8:00 p.m. Eastern time.

Alternate Payment Model (APM) entities can submit applications as well, but they must apply for all performance categories.

Key updates for 2025:

Expanded EUC exceptions: Physicians, groups and virtual groups can apply for reweighting of one or more MIPS performance categories—Quality, Cost, Improvement Activities, and Promoting Interoperability—if they experience circumstances that:

Prevent data collection necessary for MIPS reporting.

Hinder data submission for an extended period (e.g., inability to collect quality data for three months).

Disrupt normal operations, affecting performance on Cost measures and other administrative claims-based measures.

PI hardship exceptions: Eligible clinicians may request reweighting of the Promoting Interoperability category due to:

Decertified electronic health record (EHR) technology.

Insufficient internet connectivity.

Extreme and uncontrollable circumstances such as natural disasters, practice closures, severe financial distress, or vendor issues.

Lack of control over the availability of certified EHR technology.

These updates offer critical flexibility to address unforeseen challenges that may impact MIPS reporting. Practices are encouraged to assess their eligibility and submit applications as needed to avoid potential payment penalties.

If your application is approved, you will not be required to report data for the performance category or categories included in your approved application. However, please note that a qualifying data submission will override approved reweighting on a category-by-category basis. Any qualifying data you, or someone on your behalf, submits will be scored, and those performance categories will contribute to your final score.

LITTLE ROCK, Ark. – A lawsuit was filed in Little Rock federal court on Thursday to overturn an Arkansas law preventing pharmacy benefit managers from operating pharmacies in the state.

The suit filed by the pharmacy benefit management firm Express Scripts by Evernorth claims that Act 624 of 2025 violates the Constitution and federal law. It requests that the court prevent Act 624 from going into effect.

St. Louis-based Express Scripts is the pharmacy benefit management arm of The Cigna Group, a multinational health care and insurance company. Pharmacy benefits managers act as intermediaries between pharmaceutical companies and insurance companies to set rates, including the compensation amounts paid to pharmacies.

Act 624 prohibits pharmacy benefit managers (PBMs) from owning pharmacies in Arkansas.

The lawsuit claims that Act 624 violates the Constitution’s Commerce Clause and the Privileges & Immunities Clause. It also states the law violates the Constitution’s Attainder Clause, which prevents laws from being passed that punish individuals or groups without a trial.

The lawsuit continues to claim that it interferes with federal law since the act would prevent Express Scripts from honoring its TRICARE contract with the Department of Defense. TRICARE is the health plan, including pharmacy support, for active duty National Guard, reserve, and retired military members and their families.

The suit has multiple plaintiffs under the Express Scripts umbrella and is filed against the state pharmacy board and its members.

Evernorth Health Services Vice President of Pharmacy Practice and pharmacist Susan Peppers said the suit was filed to ensure continued access to care.

“Our family of pharmacies—including Express Scripts Pharmacy, Accredo Specialty Pharmacy and Freedom Fertility Pharmacy—are proud to serve Arkansans, and this law will disrupt their access to the care we provide,” Peppers said. “If this law takes effect in January, hundreds of thousands of Arkansans will be left scrambling to navigate the forced closure of pharmacies and finding new ways to get their medicines and critical clinical support.”

Peppers continued that Evernorth was doing “everything we can” to protect Arkansas patients.

Attorney General Tim Griffin, whose office will defend against the case, stated that PBMs hinder access and quality.

“Pharmacy benefit managers wield outsized power to reap massive profits at the expense of consumers,” Griffin said. “The rise of PBMs as middlemen in the prescription drug market has resulted in patients facing fewer choices, lower quality care, and higher prices.”

Griffin added that PBMs “leverage their affiliated pharmacies to manipulate prices, corrupt the market, and destroy competition. Through Act 624, Arkansas is standing up to PBMs on behalf of consumers, and I will vigorously defend our law.”",https://www.myarklamiss.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/15/2025/05/pharmacy.jpg?w=1280,N,0.0,2025-05-29 21:56:29.622210

Mental health is a vital part of your overall well-being. Whether you’re having difficulty managing day-to-day stress or navigating more complex challenges, TRICARE offers mental health support when—and where—you need it.

“Getting care early is just like preventive medicine, such as labs or regular checkups,” said Jeannine Pickrell, director for Population Health and Disease Management, TRICARE Health Plan, at the Defense Health Agency. “You can prevent smaller issues from becoming big ones by checking in with yourself through a TRICARE mental health provider. TRICARE offers a variety of ways to find and get the care you need.”

More than ever, people recognize the importance of mental well-being. Unlock your health by understanding how to access care based on your TRICARE plan.

Ways to access care

TRICARE has options for different mental health needs. Services are available whether you’re seeking support for the short or long term. Depending on your health plan, you may need a referral or pre-authorization.

You can start by:

• Talking to your primary care manager

• Reaching out directly to a TRICARE-authorized provider

• Exploring virtual health options to speak with a provider from home

Not sure what applies to you? Check with your TRICARE contractor.

Covered mental health services

As described in the Mental Health and Substance Use Disorder Services Fact Sheet, TRICARE covers services can include:

• Outpatient counseling like individual, group, or family therapy

• Intensive outpatient programs that meet throughout the week

• Partial hospitalization programs that meet throughout the week

• Inpatient care at a hospital or other facility

Are virtual health services a better fit for you? TRICARE covers many virtual options for getting mental health care from your own home. Options include telemental health services through virtual-only providers, as well as local providers who may offer a combination of in-person and virtual health services.

How you access them is specific to your region:

• East Region: The East Region contractor, Humana Military, offers services through Doctor on Demand, Teladoc, Telamynd, and Talkspace, as well as other smaller provider groups.

• West Region: The West Region contractor, TriWest Healthcare Alliance, offers services through Doctor on Demand, Teladoc, Telemynd, Skytherapist, Fusion Care Group, NVelUp, Open Mind Health, Talkspace, and Veterans Room, as well as other smaller provider groups.

• Overseas: If you’re overseas, the country where you live must allow virtual health services. Your provider must be licensed to practice where you live. Contact your TRICARE Overseas Regional Call Center for more information, including eligibility of providers. Visit the Overseas virtual health page to learn more about the overseas requirements.

However, there may be limitations on these services in certain areas to include Medication-assisted treatment, substance use disorder, and applied behavior analysis services may not be included.

To request telemental health services:

• Use the Find a Doctor tool to search your regional contractor’s network provider directory.

• Contact your regional contractor. You can learn more about the options available to you based on who you are and where you live.

Types of mental health care

TRICARE provides mental health coverage for all eligible beneficiaries. How you access them depends on your health plan, category, and whether care is immediate or ongoing.

Emergency mental health care

If you or someone you know is at immediate risk of self-harm, or harm to others, this is a medical emergency. Emergency mental health care doesn’t require a referral. You should:

• Call 911 or go to the nearest emergency room.

• Your TRICARE regional contractor should be contacted within 24 hours or next day, if admitted.

You can also call the Veterans Crisis Line:

• Call 988, option 1.

•Text 838255.

• Chat online.

Again, if you or a loved one is in danger or needs urgent support, go to the nearest emergency room or call 911.

Nonemergency mental health care

You don’t need to be in crisis to seek help. TRICARE covers a range of mental health services. How you access them depends on your beneficiary group.

Here’s how it works:

Active duty service members

• Care must begin at a military hospital or clinic, or a TRICARE-authorized provider for those enrolled in TRICARE Prime Remote.

• ADSMs may also request an evaluation from their supervisor without providing a reason. These are confidential and protected. This is part of the Brandon Act implementation, which aims to reduce the stigma of seeking mental health care.

• Referrals and pre-authorizations are required outside military hospitals or clinics.

All other TRICARE beneficiaries

Do you have TRICARE Prime?

• You don’t need a referral if you see a TRICARE network provider.

• Beyond basic outpatient care, a referral may be required.

• Start with your PCM if you’re unsure what you need.

Do you have TRICARE Select?

• You can visit any TRICARE-authorized provider for mental health services.

• Referrals aren’t required, but you’ll pay lower out-of-pocket costs by choosing a network provider.

• You don’t need a pre-authorization for routine care, but some specialty services may require one.

Do you have TRICARE For Life?

• You should see a Medicare provider. Follow Medicare's rules for mental health care until those benefits are exhausted.

• Medicare is your primary payer. TRICARE is secondary.

• If Medicare benefits are exhausted, you’ll need a referral and pre-authorization from TRICARE before you get care.

Are you a National Guard and Reserve member or family member?

• Your eligibility and TRICARE coverage depend on the National Guard or Reserve member’s duty status. You should contact your unit’s personnel office with eligibility questions. You can review your eligibility in milConnect. When getting care, seeing a TRICARE network provider can reduce your costs. If you’re on active duty orders for:

• More than 30 days: You’re eligible. You receive the same benefits as ADSMs.

• 30 days or less: You may be eligible to enroll in TRICARE Reserve Select.

Do you have a TRICARE health plan overseas?

• Availability varies by location and some services may be limited. Contact the TRICARE Overseas contractor for help finding what is right for you.

Other resources include:

• The Psychological Health Resource Center (866-966-1020) for community resources

• The Military Health System Nurse Advice Line (800-874-2273, option 1) for mental health questions

• Military OneSource (800-342-9647) for non-medical counseling services

• Unit or military chaplains for non-medical support

• U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs or VetCenter for eligible veterans

Taking the first step

When it comes to mental health challenges—or maintaining good mental health—you’re not alone. It’s okay to reach out to find the services right for you, and TRICARE has your back every step of the way.

My Military Health—the Defense Health Agency’s new care model—is changing how service members get mental health care by making the experience more convenient and user-friendly.

“My Military Health has rolled out to all Defense Health Agency military hospitals and clinics worldwide with significant potential to enhance patient convenience and expand access to care,” said Dr. Julie Freeman, DHA’s chief strategic innovation officer. “Virtual mental health care is just one of the options offered to patients.”

Studies show the great potential for virtual mental health care to improve access, reduce costs, and enhance patient engagement. Virtual mental health visits see greater adherence to follow through on care plans. Patients often feel like there is less stigma and greater confidentiality if they aren’t seen going to a mental health clinic.

Meet U.S. Air Force Maj. Betsy Trahan

Trahan, a clinical psychologist, works at the 96th Medical Group at Eglin Air Force Base, Florida. Eglin is one of five My Military Health venture sites that are testing new technologies and streamlining processes to enhance the overall patient experience. Trahan helps bring this system to life by working with experts from all military branches to make the program better.

Benefit 1: Getting Care Faster

My Military Health makes it easier for service members to get the help they need when they need it.

""We've seen big improvements in access to care at Eglin,"" Trahan said. “The program gives us more flexibility in how we deliver care and more creative ways to help patients.”

Trahan reported, “New patient appointments have increased by 61% since we started. Before, patients waited about 30 days for mental health care. Now, we can see them in just one week.”

For service members who need mental health care, this shorter wait can make a significant difference.

Benefit 2: Continuity of Care

Military life often means moving or deploying, which too often prevents patients from continuing treatment. My Military Health offers an option to keep care available no matter where service members are stationed.

“Patients can now see their provider when they want to,” said Trahan. She stressed how important it is for patients to “work with a provider who really knows them” and have “flexible options for getting care.”

This steady, consistent support from a team of available providers helps patients build trust in the system. Wherever they are, patients know they can find a provider who knows their history. This care also supports military readiness—the ability of service members to fulfill their mission anywhere in the world.

Mental health is a core component of readiness. My Military Health makes it possible for service members to stay healthy wherever they serve.

Benefit 3: Using Cutting Edge Technology to Support Patients Better

My Military Health uses digital tools like Scheduled Virtual Visits to make health care easy for patients and providers. Scheduled Virtual Visits enables providers to see their patients quickly which can help patients avoid wait times during a mental health episode.

When doctors find patients who can use digital tools for their current needs, they can act right away. As another Eglin team member put it, “If you have the patient on the phone, we can connect them right now through a virtual visit as one way to improve accessibility.”

By adding digital tools to therapy, patients get more complete care in a way that fits their individual needs and schedules.

Benefit 4: Working as a Team to Improve Patient Care

My Military Health helps different types of providers work better together, which Trahan said is a key to success.

“Working as a team has been vital to the program's success,” she explained. “We work with primary care and specialty clinics to learn from each other and coordinate each patient’s level of care. By doing so, we are improving patient care.”

Benefit 5: Improvements in Access and Satisfaction

Eglin is seeing big improvements thanks to My Military Health. Not only has it improved wait times, but patients are coming back to Eglin because they find it easier to connect with providers there.

Trahan acknowledged many other benefits coming to DHA. “Our staff and providers are more satisfied,” which helps address the burnout problem common in military health. She continued, “My Military Health helps providers feel part of positive change.”

Benefit 6: Potential to Change the Game Across the Enterprise

The success at Eglin shows how My Military Health can help DHA better support military readiness through improved mental health care. My Military Health allows providers and service members a flexible way to meet and securely talk about mental health care. It gives patients an opportunity to have conversations in real time to get support whenever and wherever they need it.

“We know mental health is a major concern, and there's limited care available on and off base,"" Trahan said. “We need smart ways to reach patients where they are.”

My Military Health offers exactly this kind of smart solution, balancing better access with provider well-being. Trahan said this as an ongoing effort, “This is a continuing project. We keep finding new ways to help our staff and patients thrive.”",https://d1ldvf68ux039x.cloudfront.net/thumbs/photos/2505/9068085/1000w_q95.jpg,N,1.0,2025-05-29 15:56:30.055217

Related: A Decade After Scandal, VA Health Care May Be at Another Crossroads Story Continues","The Department of Veterans Affairs and Pentagon will work more closely to ensure that veterans have an easier time accessing health care and benefits as they leave the U.S. military, the departments' secretaries announced Wednesday.

VA Secretary Doug Collins and Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth signed a memorandum last week pledging that their departments will collaborate on care for veterans and enroll troops in VA care before they leave the service. They also plan to improve support for service members diagnosed with mental health conditions as they transition to civilian life.

The two men released a video Wednesday saying the cooperation is a priority to ensure that service members and veterans get the benefits they have earned.

""We believe that Americans who raise their right hand and serve deserve a Department of Defense and VA that work in tandem looking out for their best needs,"" Collins said.

""It's a shame that for far too many years that pipeline, there's been a disconnect,"" Hegseth said.

Roughly 200,000 service members leave the armed forces each year. And while they are required to take transition assistance classes beginning at least a year before they plan to leave the military, many don't, receiving waivers from their commanding officers, according to the Government Accountability Office.

The two-day programs provide information on career development, VA benefits, education and other support services. But veterans advocates say that allowing service members to opt out of the courses or rush through the curriculum is a disservice to veterans.

During a hearing in March, veterans service organizations said that, without attending the Transition Assistance Program in a timely manner, veterans may not apply for benefits or prepare adequately for their transition.

""Systemic delays must be remedied to ensure service members thrive rather than struggle in life post military service. Veterans who experience a turbulent transition will surely influence how friends, family and siblings view service in the military,"" Andrew Petrie, senior policy associate at the American Legion, said in a statement to the House Veterans Affairs subcommittee on economic opportunity.

The departments have increased transition support in the past several years, creating a transition program for service members with mental health issues to provide referrals and coaching, and making phone calls to new veterans.

But those programs required active participation by the service members -- enrolling in VA health services or requesting assistance from providers with knowledge of the programs.

In their memo signed May 23, Hegseth and Collins pledged that the two departments would ""optimize shared use of health care resources, facilities and workforce.""

The departments already operate a joint medical facility, the James Lovell Federal Health Care Center in North Chicago Illinois, and have agreements at roughly a dozen Defense Department clinics to allow VA medical professionals to see veterans in those facilities. But the new memo pledges to increase joint planning and shared expertise and infrastructure even more, although it does not include specific steps the departments plan to take.

According to the agreement, the VA and DoD also are working on a plan that would allow service members to enroll in VA health care before their end of service date.

And they pledged to improve continuity of care for service members with mental health conditions -- for example, communication between providers and pre-scheduled appointments.

""Providing continuity of care is more than just policy; it will help save lives,"" they wrote.

""This is only the beginning. From the unified electronic health record and a Joint Separation Health Assessment to strengthen suicide prevention initiatives, our departments will continue breaking down barriers to better serve those who serve,"" they wrote.

They include Express Scripts and CVS Caremark, which is owned by the same parent company that runs CVS retail pharmacies around the country.
Independent pharmacies have lobbied the Arkansas Legislature for years for protections against what they say are uncompetitive practices by PBMs.
Now Express Scripts, which does a robust mail-order pharmacy business in Arkansas, is leading the legal charge against what is now Act 624.
Express Scripts is owned by The Cigna Group, a Connecticut-based insurance and health care company ranked 15 on the Fortune 500 list.","One of the largest health care companies in the country announced Thursday it’s suing Arkansas over a new law, signed by Gov. Sarah Sanders in April, that would bar it from operating pharmacies in the state.

The plaintiff, Express Scripts, is a pharmacy benefit manager, or PBM, a corporate middleman that handles prescription drug claims and negotiates prices on behalf of insurers. PBMs help determine how much pharmacies get paid for filling prescriptions — but the nation’s three biggest PBMs are owned by health care conglomerates that also run their own in-house pharmacies. They include Express Scripts and CVS Caremark, which is owned by the same parent company that runs CVS retail pharmacies around the country.

Independent pharmacies have lobbied the Arkansas Legislature for years for protections against what they say are uncompetitive practices by PBMs. This spring, lawmakers passed a bill that prohibits a company that operates a PBM from also holding a pharmacy license in the state. The ban, which takes effect in January, includes online pharmacies that handle mail-order prescriptions.

CVS fought hard against the bill, mounting an aggressive PR campaign and saying the company’s 23 retail locations in Arkansas could be forced to close if it were signed into law. (CVS has said more recently it’s searching for a way to keep those stores open but warned they’re still at risk of closure.)

Now Express Scripts, which does a robust mail-order pharmacy business in Arkansas, is leading the legal charge against what is now Act 624.

In a complaint filed in federal court in Little Rock on Thursday, Express Scripts argues the new state law “imperils the health” of more than 50,000 Arkansans who depend on various pharmacies operated by the company. Among them are members of the military and their families who are covered by TRICARE, which provides health insurance for servicemembers.

Express Scripts “has served for more than 20 years as the principal mail-order pharmacy provider for the U.S. Department of Defense’s TRICARE program, which provides healthcare services to military members, retirees, and families,” the complaint says. “Last year, Express Scripts Pharmacy dispensed more than 386,000 prescriptions to over 20,000 TRICARE beneficiaries in Arkansas.”

Express Scripts also operates a separate mail-order pharmacy, Accredo Health Group, that it says provides specialty medications to over 5,700 patients in Arkansas with complex and chronic medical conditions “including cancer, bleeding disorders, multiple sclerosis, and numerous rare diseases.” Many of those prescriptions have gone to TRICARE beneficiaries, the complaint says.

A third pharmacy group affiliated with the company, Freedom Fertility Pharmacy, is “the nation’s leading fertility pharmacy” and serves hundreds of Arkansans trying to “grow their families,” the complaint says.

Express Scripts says the new Arkansas law is “unconstitutional several times over.” It violates the U.S. Constitution’s commerce clause and prohibitions on states unfairly “burdening out-of-state citizens” and punishing “specifically designated persons or groups,” the company argues. And it impermissibly attempts to preempt federal statutes and regulations governing TRICARE, the complaint says.

Arkansas Attorney General Tim Griffin said the state was “standing up to PBMs on behalf of consumers” in passing Act 624 and vowed to defend the law in court.

“Pharmacy benefit managers wield outsized power to reap massive profits at the expense of consumers,” he said in an emailed statement. “The rise of PBMs as middlemen in the prescription drug market has resulted in patients facing fewer choices, lower quality care, and higher prices. PBMs leverage their affiliated pharmacies to manipulate prices, corrupt the market, and destroy competition.”

All of the “big three” PBMs are affiliated with corporations that dominate the U.S. health insurance landscape. Express Scripts is owned by The Cigna Group, a Connecticut-based insurance and health care company ranked 15 on the Fortune 500 list. CVS Caremark is owned by CVS Health, which also owns insurer Aetna along with some 9,000 retail pharmacy locations nationwide; it’s the sixth-largest company in the country.

The third big PBM, Optum Rx, is owned by UnitedHealth Group, the fourth-largest company in the U.S., behind only Walmart, Amazon and Apple.

The complaint says the law — and comments made by state legislators who argued for the bill this spring — make it “abundantly clear that the statute’s purpose and effect is to protect local pharmacies domiciled in Arkansas from out-of-state competition, and to do so by punishing specific out-of-state competitors.”

If the Legislature can ban large out-of-state companies to protect local independent pharmacies, the plaintiffs argue, it could do so in other sectors as well.

“Imagine, for example, a bill that bans out-of-state movie streaming services such as Netflix from serving customers in Arkansas because movie streaming services compete with local, independent movie theaters,” the complaint says. “Myriad examples of similar protectionist legislation involving a range of businesses, from grocery and hardware stores to gas stations, are easy to envision.”

The Leapfrog Group, an independent nonprofit watchdog organization, evaluates hospitals nationwide on safety and prevention measures, including those concerning errors, injuries, and infections, assigning grades from A to F twice a year to participating facilities.

Participation in Leapfrog is voluntary, with hospitals choosing to report their safety and quality data to the organization. In the latest assessment for Spring 2025, 32 percent of U.S. hospitals received an “A,” while 73 percent of military hospitals achieved the top grade – a significant increase from 43 percent in Spring 2024, according to Dr. David Smith, the acting director of the Defense Health Agency.

“We show excellent performance measured against our peers and against ourselves over time,” Smith stated in a message to DHA staff. He added DHA’s partnership with The Leapfrog Group is “one of many avenues in which we transparently share our performance and compare ourselves to other hospitals and health systems across the country.”

Leapfrog’s evaluation covers over 30 areas, including infection rates, surgical safety, error prevention, and staff performance. Walter Reed’s consistent top grades underscore its dedication to transparency and continuous improvement in patient safety. This was the third consecutive Grade A performance for Walter, one of 16 DHA facilities to earn the “A” grade for Spring 2025.

Patients with the rare, X-linked progressive neurodevelopmental disorder are already being treated with the gene therapy within part A of the ongoing Phase I/II REVEAL trials. In part B of the study, which will serve as the pivotal trial, investigators will assess whether 15 patients gain or regain at least one developmental milestone associated with Rett syndrome at 6 years of age or older. The pivotal study will be a single-arm, open-label trial with each patient serving as their own control.

Dallas-based Taysha obtained written feedback from the FDA on key elements of the planned trial as part of discussions under the regenerative medicine advanced therapy (RMAT) pathway.

""We believe aligning with the FDA on key elements of our proposed pivotal trial design validates these important findings that underpin our pivotal trial design and strengthen our conviction in the transformative potential of TSHA-102,"" Taysha CEO Sean Nolan said in a statement. ""Importantly, this progress sets us on an efficient and expeditious path to potentially deliver TSHA-102 to patients and families suffering from this devastating disease with high unmet need.""

The FDA advised Taysha to submit the pivotal part B trial protocol and associated statistical analysis plan as an amendment to its investigational new drug (IND) application, which would eliminate the need for a formal end-of-phase meeting, Taysha said. The company expects to submit this amendment this quarter and initiate the pivotal trial in the third quarter of 2025.

Taysha developed the pivotal trial design after analyzing natural history data from a longitudinal study from the International Rett Syndrome Foundation, in which investigators found patients at least 6 years of age tended to reach a developmental plateau with a low likelihood of gaining new or regaining developmental milestones.

In part A of the REVEAL trials, 10 patients with Rett syndrome between 6 years and 21 years of age have received TSHA-102, which is designed to deliver a truncated version of the gene that's abnormal in Rett syndrome patients, MECP2. The transgene, which the company refers to as miniMECP2, functions like the full-length MECP2 gene, according to Taysha.

All patients gained at least one developmental milestone related to fine motor, gross motor, or communication skills after receiving the gene therapy, with patients who received a higher dose responding 25 percent faster than those who received a low dose. Investigators did not observe serious adverse events or dose-limiting toxicities related to TSHA-102, and treatment-emergent adverse events were mild to moderate in severity.

Separately on Wednesday, Taysha announced the pricing of an underwritten public offering from which it expects to earn gross proceeds of approximately $200 million. The public offering, which is expected to close on or about Friday, covers 46,868,687 shares of Taysha's common stock at a price to the public of $2.75 per share and, for certain investors, pre-funded warrants to purchase 25,858,586 shares at an offering price of $2.749 per pre-funded warrant. Taysha also granted underwriters a 30-day option to purchase up to an additional 10,909,090 shares at the public offering price.",https://crain-platform-precisiononcologynews-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/app-icons/favicon.ico,N,0.0,2025-05-29 13:56:21.854969

One of the best-known is Medicare, a health care program primarily aimed at people over 65 years old. However, there is another less well-known but equally important program: TRICARE.

What is TRICARE and who can benefit? Social Security clarifies

TRICARE is a health care program managed by the Defense Health Agency (DHA). It is designed to provide medical coverage to active and retired members of the U.S. armed forces, as well as their families. This includes members of the National Guard and Reservists.

TRICARE beneficiaries have access to a wide range of medical services, including hospital care, medical consultations, dental and vision services, and prescription medications. In addition, for those who are also eligible for Medicare Part A and B, TRICARE acts as a supplement, covering deductibles and copayments that Medicare doesn't cover.

How to access easily? You must meet this in the U.S.

Eligibility for TRICARE depends on the sponsor's military status. Active duty service members and their families are automatically enrolled. Retirees and their dependents must make sure to keep their information updated in the Defense Enrollment Eligibility Reporting System (DEERS) to continue receiving benefits.

TRICARE offers numerous advantages. Among them, comprehensive coverage of medical services, low out-of-pocket costs, and access to a wide network of health care providers stand out. In addition, for beneficiaries who are also enrolled in Medicare, TRICARE provides additional coverage that helps reduce total medical expenses.

SSA's commitment to beneficiaries and recent changes in the law

The Social Security Administration (SSA) has shown its commitment to beneficiaries through the implementation of the Social Security Fairness Act. This law eliminates provisions that reduced benefits for certain workers, such as teachers and firefighters, who also received pensions not covered by Social Security.

As a result, more than 3M people have seen increases in their monthly benefits, some exceeding $1,000. Recently, changes have been implemented in identity verification to access SSA services.

All with the goal of improving security and efficiency in the administration of benefits. These changes reflect SSA's ongoing commitment to adapt to beneficiaries' needs and ensure the integrity of their programs.",https://elcierredigital.com/filesedc/uploads/image/post/montaje-donald-trump-seguridad-social-y-dolares_1200_800.webp,N,0.0,2025-05-29 13:56:26.028215

I know claims are being denied across the board for a lot of people, but is anyone else experiencing randomized claims being denied?

I have 19 claims throughout the year that are denied and yet some to the same exact provider were paid. They are billing the same way because I called them and asked. Tricare keeps saying that I'm out of their system for those bills. I have done a three-way call with DEERS and Tricare to ensure that I am in fact in their systems under the same numbers that both of them have.

At this point I have over $30,000 in bills from 7 different billing agencies and of course no one bills in proper time so early ones from the year are past a 90-day claim appeal. I have no clue what to do anymore. I've already been escalated to level three claims with Tricare and they are obviously not doing anything despite a case being opened for me. They don't know why I keep being randomly denied except to say that I wasn't in their system at the time. The providers have resubmitted the bills and they are still not being paid despite Tricare agreeing I should have been in the system. Bonus: I'm Triwest region so I have to wait for them to open before being transferred to Eastern time for claims.

Serious question: Am I allowed to sue Tricare at this point? $30,000 is more than my entire savings and even if I could get a loan to pay it all and avoid going to collections, I'd have less than zero left. It seems at this point they simply do not wish to pay them.",,N,-1.0,2025-05-29 00:56:59.696483

(WRIC) — An audit report reveals that the health insurance program for military service members and their families, TRICARE, put beneficiaries at risk due to a lack of internal controls.

According to an audit conducted by the Department of Justice, TRICARE put beneficiaries at risk of paying much higher costs, according to reports by the Inspector General after it reviewed financial records across both TRICARE’s East and West regions, which include all 50 U.S. states.

The reviewed financial records were from November 2022 to February 2025 and found that nationwide, their policy did not require a regulated rate among states for the service equipment device “Intermittent Limb Compression Devices.”

According to the report, the Defense Health Agency (DHA) allowed a rental rate for certain items, such as intermittent limb compression sleeves, to exceed the purchase rate (non-renal) for new compression devices in seven states, including Virginia.

The DHA allowed the state prevailing rates for rental intermittent limb compression sleeves devices to range from $150 in Mississippi to $12,000 in Connecticut. These rental rates exceed purchase amounts by 533% and $6,005 nationwide.

Limb compression sleeves

For limb compression sleeves, Virginia is charging a monthly rental rate of $4,680 and a purchase rate of $3,450 which is a 35.7% difference than the average.

The DHA also allowed for state prevailing rates for “miscellaneous prosthetic implants” with prosthetic items including arm and leg prosthetics and cochlear devices.

These prosthetic items ranged state to state, anywhere from $412 in New York to $3,300 in Georgia — which is 101% higher than the national average rate of $1,645 and 701% higher than the lowest rate of $412.

Rental sleep apnea mouthguard

As for the rental sleep apnea mouthguard rentals costs, the lowest was $207 in South Dakota, and the highest was $5,000 in South Carolina. Virginia is the second highest at $595.

The TRICARE East Region contractor placed a rental value of $5,000 on the sleep apnea mouthguards in South Carolina. However, the contractor of the mouthguard only placed a purchase value of $2,500 in South Carolina–this is half the amount TRICARE is charging for rentals alone.

Implantable anchors and screws

Implantable anchors and screws — bone-to-bone or soft tissue-to-bone implants — are an additional benefit that is offered to beneficiaries under TRICARE. According to the audit, the DHA allowed for state prevailing rates for these items as well. These prices ranged from $795 in Maine to $6,096 in New Jersey.

New Jersey’s rate is 217% higher than the national rate of $1,925, and 667% higher than the lowest rate of $795 in Maine.

In Virginia, the state prevailing rates for prosthetic implants remain at the average of $1,075.

In 2020, Virginia ranked third out of 50 states for having the highest military personnel in the nation.

With TRICARE’s state-regulated pricing issue, this could make it increasingly more difficult for active duty members and veterans to access their benefits.

The DHA’s state prevailing rates far exceed rates similarly developed by organizations such as FAIR Health, according to the audit. Fair Health is a non-profit organization based in New York.

The non-profit also analyzes the health care costs of 48 billion private health care claim records and 45 billion Medicare claim records for 10,000 services in all areas of the U.S., dating as far back as 2002.",https://www.wric.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/74/2024/12/6762555e2186f6.28943367.jpeg?w=1280,N,-1.0,2025-05-28 18:56:40.736835

My question is concerning mandatory Medicare sign-up requirements. Why do I have to sign up for Medicare coverage at 65 when I can’t start collecting full Social Security benefits until I turn 67? My Social Security benefits will not pay for my mandatory Medicare because I can’t start collecting full Social Security benefits until I’m 67!

I currently pay for Tricare and utilize my local Veterans Administration medical facilities and referrals for my healthcare. With me turning 65 and having to wait until I’m 67 for my full Social Security benefits, it just seems unfair that I’ll have to pay out of pocket Medicare monthly expenses for two years! Is there any way to avoid this unfair penalty?

Signed: Retired Navy Vet

Dear Retired Navy Vet: First, I want to thank you for your military service to our country. Please know that here at the AMAC Foundation we care a lot about our veterans, and you may find the “For Veterans” section of our Foundation website interesting (www.amacfoundation.org).

Regarding your question, you should be aware that enrolling in Medicare is not mandatory, but there are consequences if you do not enroll when you become eligible (normally at age 65). For one thing, if you are a retired veteran on military TriCare, you will lose your TriCare benefits if you don’t enroll in Medicare when you are eligible (TriCare requires that you enroll in Medicare when eligible). And, since you are not yet collecting Social Security, you will be required to separately pay the Medicare Part B premium directly to Medicare (they will bill you when you enroll in Medicare). Another potential consequence is that if you do not enroll in Medicare Part B when you are first eligible, you may incur a lifetime late enrollment penalty for enrolling in Part B later.

Something else to keep in mind is that there are two “parts” to Medicare – Part A (which is coverage for inpatient hospitalization services), and Part B, which is coverage for outpatient healthcare services (doctors, medical tests, etc.). Medicare Part A is free to you, but there is a premium for Medicare Part B ($185/month for 2025). Note that you will need to pay a Part B premium as long as you are enrolled in Medicare Part B (it doesn’t go away after you are collecting Social Security, but it is taken from your Social Security payment). And there is no way for you to avoid the Part B premium after enrolling, and enrolling in Part B is necessary for you to continue your military TriCare-for-life benefits. Note that Medicare Part A and Part B do not include prescription drug coverage, but your TriCare coverage usually does.

It’s important to note that Medicare and Social Security are two independent senior programs with different eligibility rules. As you may know, you can collect early (reduced) Social Security at age 65 (and have your Medicare Part B premium deducted from your SS payment). But you would be collecting Social Security early and, in addition to a reduced benefit, you would also be subject to Social Security’s annual earnings test if you are still working. The SS earnings test limits how much you can earn before some of your SS benefits are taken away (if you exceed the earning limit prior to your full retirement age).

So, is it unfair that you must pay for Medicare Part B before you are collecting Social Security? Well, I think not, because the two programs are completely independent benefits (the Social Security Administration merely administers Medicare payments as a convenience).

Walter Reed Office of Command Communications

Walter Reed once again earned an “A” grade from The Leapfrog Group for Spring 2025, reflecting the medical center’s continued commitment to patient safety and high-quality care for service members, their families, and other Military Health System beneficiaries.

The Leapfrog Group, an independent nonprofit watchdog organization, evaluates hospitals nationwide on safety and prevention measures, including those concerning errors, injuries, and infections, assigning grades from A to F twice a year to participating facilities.

Participation in Leapfrog is voluntary, with hospitals choosing to report their safety and quality data to the organization. In the latest assessment for Spring 2025, 32 percent of U.S. hospitals received an “A,” while 73 percent of military hospitals achieved the top grade - a significant increase from 43 percent in Spring 2024, according to Dr. David Smith, the acting director of the Defense Health Agency (DHA).

“We show excellent performance measured against our peers and against ourselves over time,” Smith stated in a message to DHA staff. He added DHA’s partnership with The Leapfrog Group is “one of many avenues in which we transparently share our performance and compare ourselves to other hospitals and health systems across the country.”

Leapfrog’s evaluation covers over 30 areas, including infection rates, surgical safety, error prevention, and staff performance. Walter Reed’s consistent top grades underscore its dedication to transparency and continuous improvement in patient safety. This was the third consecutive Grade A performance for Walter, one of 16 DHA facilities to earn the “A” grade for Spring 2025 (https://dha.mil/News/2025/05/01/16/50/Sixteen-Military-Hospitals-Receive-Leapfrogs-Highest-Safety-Grade).

Introduction

U.S. military service members, retirees, and their dependents deserve the highest quality of health care for their service and support to the nation. Whether they are seeking care for pregnancy, service-related injuries, or Individual Medical Readiness (IMR)ii requirements, there should never be a delay in care like those experienced in recent years. The Defense Health Agency (DHA) has a responsibility to serve and protect the health of all beneficiaries, and the use of Electronic Health Records (EHR) should be seamless so that patients can visit any military medical facility to receive the treatment they need. When EHR failure occurs due to server issues, cyber-attacks, or other communication infrastructure breakdowns, patient safety is the primary concern for medical providers who are unable to access and update their patient’s medical history and unable to fill vital tests and prescriptions. Each healthcare data breach costs approximately $10 million which is double the cost of some other industries, making healthcare infrastructure a priority target to hackers.iii Protections and redundancy are needed to prevent single-point vulnerabilities to EHRs so the millions of beneficiaries can access the healthcare they are entitled to by their military service.

Military Health System

The Military Health System (MHS) Genesis is the newest iteration of DHA’s EHR system. The primary function and purpose of MHS is to support the servicemember and beneficiaries through the medical readiness missions of each branch of service to ensure a “fit to fight” force and to prepare for them for deployment.iv But it’s more than just warfighter readiness, it is also in-patient hospital stays, surgery, general family medicine, humanitarian assistance, and medical research to name a few. Only 14% of the 9.5 million beneficiaries are active-duty service members; the remaining 86% fall into categories of dependents of active-duty members, retirees and their dependents, and reserve component members and their dependents.v

The DHA’s budget is passed by the annual Defense Appropriations Bill and accounts for various costs to include personnel costs, construction, and Veterans Affairs (VA) related hospital funding through the Unified Medical Budget.vi The FY2025 request for funding through Congress was $61.3 billion, which is only ~7% of the Department of Defense’s (DOD) total budget.vii A portion of the budget goes to private healthcare company costs, such as co-pay costs when outsourced patients visit a non-Military Treatment Facility (MTF).viii However, one of DHA’s goals is to attract military beneficiaries to their local MTF for care instead of outsourcing to private health companies which is being done by increasing recruitment and retention of medical providers and capacity of patients able to be seen at a local MTF on a daily basis.ix As of 2023, there were a total of 736 MTFs, 135 of which were located outside the continental U.S.x

MHS Genesis EHR provides real-time patient medical history for providers to quickly review and update records during and after patient visits. These records are also available to the patient at home through the patient portal system which allows a review of doctor’s notes, see upcoming and previous appointments, schedule appointments and review prescriptions and vaccination history.xi Although EHRs improve access to care, quality of care, and is more cost-effective and efficient than paper copies or legacy systems of medical records, there are ethical and security considerations that must be realized and overcome to secure patient privacy and ensure patient safety.xii Loss or degradation in communication interfaces, such as the server lag providing the data to the consumer (patients and medical providers), can disrupt treatment facility productivity and cause financial loss, but more importantly it can impact quality of care and risk endangering patients due to the inability to access critical medical records.xiii

Outages and Effects

Over the past three years there have been several substantial outages to the MHS network that provides access to EHRs of TRICARE beneficiaries; TRICARE is the government-managed health insurance program for military beneficiaries and is managed by DHA. In 2022, a three-hour outage at 66 DOD sites, 109 Coast Guard sites and 3 VA sites prevented healthcare providers from accessing over 95,000 EHRs.xiv During the outage, the providers were unable to view MHS Genesis records and only able to access the outdated legacy EHR data, which at the time was the redundant mechanism in case of failure of MHS Genesis, preventing prescription fills, record updates, and referrals.xv The outage in 2022 was caused by a “bug” in the EHR software; the software is maintained by Oracle’s Federal EHR database and was developed by Cerner and Leidos Partnership for Defense Healthxvi and fortunately no patients were harmed by this outage.xvii

In 2023, two back-to-back outages of the same Oracle database occurred over an eight day period at five MTFs in which providers were unable to access EHRs due to a failed background process that normally would compensate through other, back-up databases but were not able to do so for unknown reasons; the entire database cluster had to be restarted, and recovery took a total of almost four hours.xviii

At the beginning of 2024, two MTFs located in Japan and one in Alaska experienced MHS Genesis EHR outages just three months after rolling out the program.xix The first outage was reportedly due to human error where all DHA systems that allowed patients to schedule appointments and laboratory tests online as well as communicate with their patient care team were deliberately disabled.xx According to a DHA representative, because the scheduling personnel at the MTFs were overwhelmed with the amount of beneficiaries who mistakenly scheduled appointments for a different MTF or with an incorrect provider, the patient portal function for self-scheduling in MHS Genesis was not available for 4.5 hours, causing more chaos for providers and patients than intended.xxi The alternative to this type of error or systems outages is for patients to call the MTF appointment phone line which many people prefer and trust as more reliable.xxii The second outage, which occurred within the same week, was due to a cyber-attack that not only affected beneficiaries in the Indo-Pacific region, but worldwide.xxiii The cyber-attack was on Change Healthcare, the nation’s largest commercial prescription processing company and used by all DOD MTFs as well as other pharmacies, and the attack left all U.S. military pharmacies unable to fill prescriptions that were not recently put into the system awaiting pick-up.xxiv The cyber-attack attributed to a Blackcat ransomware lasted over a week but costed Change Healthcare over $22 million and prevented new prescriptions from being filled for a short period of time.xxv This cyber-attack also slowed prescription filling at MTFs dramatically, creating distress and anger among beneficiaries.xxvi Not being able to fill prescriptions in a timely manner can be the difference between life and death for some patients if they are unable to obtain the medication due to the delay or forgo it due to inconvenience. DHA is not the only institution experiencing these issues, many hospitals across the U.S. have been fending off cyber-attacks for many years. In 2023 for example, a small county hospital for 120,000 rural residents had over 17,000 ransomware cyber-attacks, which dramatically slowed and stopped operations for a period of time.xxvii

In 2025 after another outage of Oracle’s database, VA hospitals decided it was time to create contingency procedures to defend against more extreme patient care disasters such as those experienced in 2020 to 2021 where over 150 patients were harmed due to errors in the new (at the time) EHR software.xxviii Providers that ordered tests or other procedures for patients ended up in an unknown queue that hospital staff did not know existed thus failed to check.xxix The orders were never filled and patients never received follow-up care or phone calls to ensure their healthcare needs were handled adequately and readily; though the specifics on these harm events were not made public, patient harm events can range from failure or delay in treatment, to adverse and preventable events that require additional medical interventions, whether prolonged or temporary.xxx xxxi Although the more recent outage only occurred at a few VA hospitals in the U.S. West and Midwest, the outage lasted for approximately four hours during peak clinic hours and caused a delay for those receiving care.xxxii

Following several cyber issues over the years, many lawmakers have challenged Cerner, Oracle, and the DOD to terminate MHS Genesis, stating complete failures in the system that have caused patient harm and lack of confidence and morale in troops, retirees, disabled veterans, and providers, while potentially wasting tens of billions of dollars in development and implementation.xxxiii When EHR software does not function properly, whether it is due to unscheduled software updates, bugs in the software, or cyber-attacks, the lives of patients are at risk and medical readiness of troops is hindered which does not correspond with the “fit to fight” servicemember readiness narrative the DOD is seeking to sustain. When an active-duty member is required to stay home because their child’s critical prescriptions are not filled, the active-duty member is distracted at best and is unable to perform essential work at worst. When EHRs are dysfunctional, providers are challenged in obtaining appropriate medical records to tract the status of chronic conditions, mitigate negative medication interactions, and refer patients to specialty care to name just a few impacts, all of which results in longer wait times for patients, continuation of persistent health issues, misdiagnosis, and concerning medication interactions. If MHS Genesis and the other companies the MTFs rely on for providing efficient healthcare continue to have vulnerabilities, the servicemembers will not have the health needed to serve the country and fight at a moment’s notice.

Redundancy and Protection

In an environment where one critical infrastructure, such as the Healthcare and Public Health Sector, relies heavily on another sector to function, the results can be devastating when damage or outages occur. Redundancy and protection against cyber-attacks and outages due to software issues need to be in place to prevent a total military healthcare breakdown, patient safety and harm events and chaos amongst servicemembers and beneficiaries. When integrating EHRs into a healthcare facility, hospital administrators have many concerns such as digital proficiency and technology acceptance within their patient care teams, thus cyber-attacks and outages only hinder the productivity and acceptance of onboarding the new systems and the users.xxxiv

Cyber-attacks can lead to data breaches of sensitive and private information and tax fraud or identity theft and can be devastating to the safety of patients who rely on imbedded technology such as insulin pumps or pacemakers; if a hacker were to access a widely and publicly searchable imbedded technology site, it could kill the patient in a matter of seconds.xxxv Trustworthy systems need to be established for healthcare facilities, ones that control and monitor physical and mechanical capabilities and provide the ability to access, manipulate, transmit, store and share resources or data where the data is protected against loss due to unauthorized access or outages.xxxvi

DHA needs to implement security measures and ensure their cyber security vendors are using appropriate tools and technologies that flag vulnerabilities and monitor every asset. The Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) developed a healthcare system cybersecurity readiness and response plan that should be utilized by DHA facilities to prevent and prepare for when cyber-attacks and outages occur.xxxvii DHA cybersecurity teams can sign up for real-time federal alerts and guidance for preventing an imminent threat but should also understand the vulnerabilities of each site and have response and recovery plans regularly updated and readily available. Specifically, life safety or life-reliant equipment should be segregated into isolated networks and redundancy on all networks. Offline endpoints, or “Golden Images”, should be implemented where data remains clean and available if the provider’s workstations are affected during an outage.xxxviii A system should be created that allows providers to continue to access critical medical information regardless of a MHS Genesis outage. The cybersecurity system should automatically back up patient data every few minutes into a separate system to prevent loss of data and prevent patient safety disasters. DHA leaders can ensure monitoring protocols are established with their cybersecurity vendor and should be exercising scenarios to better understand and plan for cyber emergencies.1 Each hospital and clinic should have their own Continuity of Operations Plan (COOP) to ensure that patient care is minimally disrupted during downtime and communicate with patients and staff early and often to prevent adverse patient safety events.

Conclusion

TRICARE servicemembers and beneficiaries deserve undisrupted access to medical care and DHA needs to do more to protect those who serve or have served our nation, no matter what the capacity. Cybersecurity within DHA facilities needs to be strengthened with a strong COOP and also strong monitoring systems that will allow for medical providers and patients to better understand and plan for downtime in EHRs and prevent patient harm events if outages do occur. More reliable back-up systems need to be established for effective redundancy instead of relying on outdated information from legacy systems. Cybersecurity teams may not be able to tackle all complex software bugs or defend against cyber-attacks from happening on DHA systems, but they can plan and respond to such cyber-attacks in the future with adequate protections in place.

Developed in partnership with the Defense Health Agency (DHA), the CDFM-H demonstrates advanced knowledge and strategic leadership in managing financial operations in defense healthcare environments. It goes beyond the core CDFM by validating critical competencies specific to healthcare financial management.

This specialty certification is designed for leaders and professionals who work in or support the Military Health System (MHS), including those at DHA, military treatment facilities (MTFs), as well as those supporting healthcare operations at federal agencies such as the Veterans Health Administration (VHA), the Department of Homeland Security (DHS), and others with significant healthcare missions.

The CDFM-H demonstrates critical knowledge across budgeting, strategic planning, oversight, and operational finance specific to the complex landscape of defense healthcare.

“As the defense healthcare enterprise grows in complexity and cost, so too must our capabilities in managing its resources,” said Rich Brady, CEO of SDFM. “The CDFM-H was developed in direct response to this need—to ensure our professionals have the skills and validation necessary to lead with confidence and accountability.”

A Credential Built for the Mission

The CDFM-H addresses a growing demand for agile, well-trained professionals who can navigate the financial challenges unique to the military and veteran healthcare system. It builds on the core competencies of the CDFM certification and affirms a candidate’s ability to lead across four key domains:

· Strategic Planning

· Management Controls

· Operational Tasks

· CFO Leadership

SDFM developed the exam with input from subject matter experts across the Department of Defense and healthcare sectors. The CDFM-H serves as a powerful tool for organizations looking to build a more qualified, mission-ready workforce and for individuals seeking to elevate their careers through specialized credentialing.

Who Should Apply

The CDFM-H is ideal for:

· Financial managers and analysts in DHA, MTFs, VHA, and supporting agencies

· CDFM or Certified Defense Financial Manager – Acquisition (CDFM-A™) holders seeking to demonstrate deeper healthcare finance expertise

· Professionals supporting healthcare operations in the DoD, VA, DHS, or Indian Health Service

· Budget and program analysts supporting the Military Health System

Certification Process

To qualify for the CDFM-H, candidates must already hold the CDFM or CDFM-A certification. The CDFM-H exam includes 90 multiple-choice questions across the four core domains. The pilot version of the exam is cost free and will only be offered to current CDFM and CDFM-A holders beginning May 28, 2025. Once the pilot concludes and the passing standard is established, the CDFM-H will be available year-round through SDFM.

“This certification is a significant inflection point in healthcare finance profession. It’s a strategic investment in the future of our healthcare financial leaders, CDFM-H strengthens the profession, the system, and ultimately, the mission of national security,” said Colonel John W. Lee, Deputy to the Assistant Director of Resources and Personnel, DHA

TRICARE offers robust coverage for military retirees, but relying on it alone may leave you vulnerable to unexpected healthcare costs, especially as you age into Medicare eligibility.

Understanding how TRICARE works with Medicare and knowing when to consider supplemental or alternative options is essential to protecting your health and finances.

TRICARE Isn’t a One-Size-Fits-All Solution After Retirement

If you’re a military retiree or soon-to-be retiree, you already know that TRICARE is one of the most comprehensive healthcare benefits available in the public sector. However, it’s not always the final answer to all your post-service healthcare needs. Especially as you approach age 65, your coverage options shift, and the financial landscape changes.

While TRICARE provides excellent foundational coverage, gaps emerge depending on your age, location, and whether you become Medicare-eligible. Without a proactive plan, you may face higher out-of-pocket costs than you expect.

Understanding TRICARE Eligibility and Coverage Tiers

TRICARE eligibility and costs vary depending on your status:

Retired Service Members Under Age 65: Most retirees qualify for TRICARE Prime or TRICARE Select.

Medicare-Eligible Retirees (Age 65+): You become eligible for TRICARE For Life (TFL) if you enroll in Medicare Part A and B.

In 2025, the Department of Defense continues to administer TRICARE through regional contractors. Your choice between TRICARE Prime and Select (before age 65) determines your network flexibility and out-of-pocket responsibilities. Once you turn 65, you are required to enroll in Medicare Part B to retain TRICARE coverage under TFL.

TRICARE For Life becomes your secondary payer after Medicare, meaning Medicare pays first and TFL covers the rest—but not always everything.

Medicare and TRICARE: What Happens at Age 65?

Once you reach age 65, you must be enrolled in both Medicare Part A and Part B to maintain TRICARE coverage. At that point, you transition into TRICARE For Life automatically.

In this setup:

Medicare becomes your primary payer.

TRICARE For Life becomes your secondary payer.

This coordination is generally effective, but it has limitations. TFL doesn’t cover routine dental or vision care, long-term care, or hearing aids. Additionally, if you delay Part B enrollment, you risk losing TRICARE coverage altogether.

What TRICARE For Life Covers—And What It Doesn’t

TRICARE For Life generally covers:

Medicare-covered services

Prescription drugs via the TRICARE Pharmacy Program

Inpatient and outpatient care

Skilled nursing facility care (short-term, following hospitalization)

Durable medical equipment

But it doesn’t cover:

Long-term custodial care

Dental and vision care (except under specific military dental plans)

Hearing aids

Acupuncture and chiropractic services not covered by Medicare

If you anticipate needing any of the above services regularly, TRICARE alone may not be enough.

Managing Out-of-Pocket Costs After Retirement

One of the greatest advantages of TRICARE is its low out-of-pocket burden. However, even with TRICARE For Life, you can still encounter these costs:

Medicare Part B premiums, which are mandatory to maintain TFL eligibility. In 2025, the standard Part B premium is $185 per month.

Prescription drug costs, which, while lower than many plans, still exist.

Care received overseas, which may require upfront payment before reimbursement.

Additionally, if you or your spouse is not yet Medicare-eligible while the other is, you may need to navigate a combination of TRICARE Select, TRICARE Prime, and employer or marketplace coverage until both reach age 65.

Retired Reservists and the TRICARE Reserve Select Transition

If you retired from the reserves, you’re in a slightly different situation. Prior to age 60, you may be eligible for TRICARE Retired Reserve (TRR), which comes with higher premiums than TRICARE Prime or Select.

At age 60, you gain access to the standard TRICARE retiree options, including Prime and Select. At 65, Medicare enrollment triggers TRICARE For Life eligibility.

It’s important not to confuse TRR with TRICARE Prime or Select—the coverage levels and out-of-pocket costs differ significantly.

Dental and Vision Are Not Included

Retired service members often mistakenly believe TRICARE includes comprehensive dental and vision benefits. In reality:

TRICARE covers only limited dental or vision services (and usually only when medically necessary).

FEDVIP (Federal Employees Dental and Vision Insurance Program) is available separately to retirees.

You can enroll in FEDVIP during the annual Open Season or after a qualifying life event. This extra coverage may be essential as you age and encounter new dental or vision needs.

When a Supplemental Policy May Make Sense

While TRICARE For Life is excellent secondary coverage, some retirees find value in an additional Medicare Supplement policy or dental/vision plans. However, you cannot use a Medicare Supplement (Medigap) policy with TRICARE For Life—they’re not compatible.

Instead, you may want to:

Explore separate long-term care insurance

Enroll in FEDVIP for dental and vision

Review other insurance options if you plan to live abroad

Choosing supplemental insurance depends heavily on your health status, financial situation, and personal preferences.

Living Overseas? TRICARE Has Limits

TRICARE For Life provides international coverage, but there are caveats:

Medicare doesn’t cover overseas care.

TRICARE becomes the primary payer in foreign countries.

You may have to pay out-of-pocket and file for reimbursement.

This structure makes planning essential if you expect to live or travel extensively outside the United States. You may want to explore international health insurance if this applies to you.

TRICARE Young Adult: A Temporary Solution for Dependents

If you have adult children between 21 and 26, they lose dependent eligibility under TRICARE at age 21 (or 23 if enrolled in college). TRICARE Young Adult (TYA) can provide temporary coverage, but it comes with separate enrollment and higher premiums.

TYA ends at age 26, after which your child must find their own insurance, either through an employer or the healthcare marketplace.

What Happens if You Delay Medicare Part B?

You must enroll in Medicare Part B when you become eligible to keep TRICARE For Life. If you delay enrollment:

You lose TRICARE coverage until you enroll in Part B.

You may face a lifetime Part B late enrollment penalty.

There are only limited exceptions, such as having employer-sponsored coverage at age 65. Even then, you need to enroll promptly once that coverage ends to avoid losing TRICARE.

Planning Ahead: Your Action Checklist

To make the most of your TRICARE and retirement healthcare:

Review your TRICARE eligibility annually as your age and family situation evolve.

Enroll in Medicare Parts A and B when you turn 65.

Consider FEDVIP enrollment for dental and vision.

Assess long-term care needs early, as this is not covered by TRICARE or Medicare.

Talk to a licensed professional about coordinating benefits if your spouse has other coverage.

TRICARE Is Strong, But Pairing It Wisely Is Smarter

As a retired service member, you earned your TRICARE benefits through years of dedicated service. But the evolving nature of healthcare in retirement means that relying solely on TRICARE—especially after age 65—could leave you with unexpected costs or limited access to services like dental, vision, or long-term care.

Take the time now to evaluate how TRICARE For Life interacts with Medicare, and whether you should pair it with other programs such as FEDVIP or long-term care insurance. Your retirement health plan should be as strong as your military career—strategic, resilient, and ready for the future.

The two bills below, signed into law by Gov. Wes Moore on Tuesday, represent significant steps in improving health care accessibility and affordability for Maryland residents.

Lowering Prescription Drug Costs for All Marylanders Now Act

This bill increases the authority of Maryland’s Prescription Drug Affordability Board. Created by the General Assembly in 2019, the board was the nation’s first independent body with authority to review affordability of drug prices and recommend ways to address high costs, including setting upper limits on what Marylanders would pay for them.

The Maryland Prescription Drug Affordability Board has authority to set the upper payment limits for high-cost prescription drugs used by individuals on state and local government health plans. The new law now allows the board to set an upper payment limit on all high-cost prescription medications purchased by individuals on private insurance plans. It specifically excludes any purchases where federal law preempts state law, Medicare Part D, for example, Tricare or the federal employee health benefit program.

Federally Qualified Health Centers Grant Program - Acquisition of Land

This bill modifies the Federally Qualified Health Centers (FQHC) Grant Program administered by the Maryland Board of Public Works. The program currently makes grants to counties, municipal corporations and nonprofit organizations for various purposes related to health centers, such as converting public buildings, acquiring existing buildings, renovating facilities, purchasing equipment and planning new centers.

The legislation allows the grant program to be used to acquire land where an FQHC will be constructed or used. These health centers are community-based and receive federal funding to provide primary care services to underserved areas. The program’s expansion would take effect Oct. 1.

By increasing funding and operational support, supporters of the bill hope it will reduce health disparities and improve health outcomes for underserved Maryland communities. The legislation does not increase the amount of state money available to fund the program.

The two bills represent a significant commitment by Maryland lawmakers to making health care more affordable and accessible to its residents. The Miles & Stockbridge health care team will continue to monitor developments as the laws are implemented and are available to answer health care providers’ questions about the legislation.
