The monthlong open enrollment period is scheduled for Nov. 10-Dec. 9. During open enrollment, or open season, beneficiaries may make changes to their Tricare coverage for the upcoming year. Tricare users who want to keep the same coverage don’t need to do anything during open enrollment.

However, the Defense Health Agency announced that some Tricare services are suspended or may be delayed during the shutdown, including the potential for delayed or cancelled outpatient appointments at military hospitals.

The agency, which administers Tricare, published a tracker to communicate service delays or interruptions.

As of Oct. 22, for inpatient services including surgeries, the agency reported: “No changes for now. Contact your provider to confirm any procedures you have scheduled.”

But the shutdown had affected Tricare’s ability to pay claims; the Tricare Prime Travel Benefit, which reimburses Prime members for certain travel costs to reach a provider; administrative actions such as appeals and other determinations; and potentially outpatient appointments and pharmacy hours at military hospitals.

Claims: “Tricare may not be able to process or pay medical claims for services received on or after Oct. 1, 2025, until funding is restored,” according to the tracker.

Tricare Prime Travel Benefit: “Not available. If you must travel for care, save your receipts, and you may file for reimbursement for reasonable travel expenses for a qualified trip.”

Administrative actions: “Government administrative actions” such as “appeals, line of duty determinations, and grievances, may be delayed or paused due to staffing levels.”

Military hospital outpatient visits, including for labs and for primary and specialty appointments: “There may be changes in hours or services. Your hospital or clinic will contact you if they must cancel an appointment. Contact your military hospital or clinic to confirm sick call or walk-in clinic hours.”

How to Change Tricare Coverage During Open Enrollment

Tricare beneficiaries may enroll in a Tricare plan or change their plan during open enrollment in one of the following ways:

Online at MilConnect, milconnect.dmdc.osd.mil/milconnect/.

By calling their Tricare regional contractor.

By mailing or faxing an enrollment form provided during open enrollment.

After spending years in the military, you may have given little thought to layoffs and job loss. But after you leave the service and start a civilian job, you are much more susceptible to these changes.

If you served in the military — even if it was years earlier — some of your military and veterans’ benefits can help financially after you lose a civilian job.

TRICARE

If you kept TRICARE benefits after retiring from the military but also had coverage from your civilian employer, then TRICARE was secondary to the employer’s coverage by helping with deductibles, copayments, and more.

But if you lose your job, TRICARE can become the primary coverage. It can be a less-expensive alternative to keeping your former employer’s coverage through COBRA, a federal law that requires employers with 20 or more employees to let former employees keep their group health insurance for up to 18 months after they lose their jobs. Even though COBRA is the same coverage you had when working, the premiums jump significantly when you leave your job.

[UPDATED MONTHLY: MOAA's TRICARE Toolkit]

“If I had lost a job and I had TRICARE Prime or TRICARE For Life as my backstop, I wouldn’t do COBRA. I’d go ahead and use the TRICARE,” said Lt. Col. Kathryn “Kitty” Meyers, USAF (Ret), a MOAA Life member, president of the Alamo (Texas) Chapter of MOAA, and a MOAA transition liaison officer.

You can also use VA health care rather than pay for COBRA, if eligible. But first, find out how the coverage, providers, and facilities compare. If you are undergoing treatment with a specialist, you may want to temporarily pay extra to continue your employer’s coverage through COBRA. Definitely find out how family members who were included on your employer’s policy would be covered.

GI Bill

The GI Bill can be a valuable way to pay for education, and it can be especially helpful to get new credentials or training while looking for a new job.

“Veterans may have the option of using their GI Bill benefit for vocational training or education, which can be particularly useful for shifting to a new career path,” said Pete Kasperowicz, a spokesman at the VA. “The VA benefit can help veterans to earn a degree [or] certificate, or pursue on-the-job training or apprenticeships. They can also get reimbursed for the cost of tests to become a licensed or certified professional in a variety of career fields.”

[FROM VA.GOV: GI Bill Eligibility]

Transition Programs

Many of the programs and resources that helped when you first left the military and started a civilian job may also prove useful during a job search years later.

Meyers also recommends networking with veterans’ groups, alumni associations, and trade groups.",https://www.moaa.org/contentassets/44998980e09547319e71f4b19cbb0648/layoff-stock-art-runstudio-getty-h.jpg,N,1.0,2025-10-22 14:59:32.763529

He added that South Africa is an important partner because it has four main dimensions: land, sea, air, and military health.

Nila is ready to put her patients and the families of Virginia’s 2nd first in Congress.","Today, Dr. Nila Devanath, a hospital physician, announced her campaign for Congress in Virginia’s 2nd Congressional District. The daughter of immigrants who built their lives in Hampton Roads, Nila is running to fight for the families, veterans, and working people she cares for every day by fixing the broken health care system and lowering costs for hardworking families.

Nila’s story is rooted in service. Her mother worked for the Navy as a Tricare primary care doctor, and she grew up surrounded by healthcare workers who taught her the value of community and service. Before becoming a doctor, she practiced law defending survivors of domestic violence at a legal aid clinic, deepening her commitment to standing up for those too often left behind. Now as an acute care doctor, she serves her Hampton Roads community, including veteran and active-duty families.

To help Dr. Nila Devanath show the constituents of Virginia’s 2nd Congressional District the same care she provides to her patients, chip in HERE.

Nila is ready to put her patients and the families of Virginia’s 2nd first in Congress. She’ll fight to lower costs — from skyrocketing health care premiums to housing, groceries, and utility bills — and to push back on the reckless attacks on Medicaid, cut drug prices, ensure veterans get the care they earned, and safeguard coverage for the 300,000 Virginians now at risk of losing it.

“In our hospitals, I see every day what happens when Washington fails to act. Families wait months for care. Veterans are forced to split their pills in half. Patients with diabetes lose their lives avoiding treatment for something as simple as a small cut because they’re afraid of the medical bills that will follow,” said Nila. “Rep. Jen Kiggans and I both swore to care for our patients, but in Washington she’s turned her back on that promise. As a doctor, I can’t stand by while families suffer. I’m running for Congress to fix this broken system for my patients, for our veterans, and for every family who deserves better.”

Virginia’s 2nd Congressional District is one of the most competitive in the country and could decide control of the U.S. House. Rep. Jen Kiggans broke her promise to protect Medicaid, voted to take health care away from 300,000 Virginians and put our hospitals at risk of closing, and just this week admitted she has no plan for Virginians who will lose coverage when ACA subsidies expire. Nila is running to bring integrity and compassion back to Washington — to fight for her patients, protect health care, and live up to her oath to care for this community every single day.",https://cdn.prod.dailykos.com/images/1491227/story_image/TwitterlaunchpostNila.png?1761092807,N,0.0,2025-10-21 23:19:55.499525

The counties affected are Maricopa and Gila.

To receive an emergency refill of prescription medications, TRICARE beneficiaries should take their prescription bottle to any TRICARE retail network pharmacy. If the bottle is unavailable or the label is damaged or missing, beneficiaries should contact Express Scripts, Inc., or their retail network pharmacy for assistance.

To find a network pharmacy, beneficiaries may call Express Scripts at 1-877-363-1303, or search the network pharmacy locator.

If possible, visit the pharmacy where the prescription was filled. Prescriptions filled by a retail chain may be filled at another store in that chain. If the clinician who prescribed the medication is available, beneficiaries can ask them to call in a new prescription to any network pharmacy.

As a reminder, TRICARE beneficiaries, other than active duty service members, may receive urgent care from any TRICARE-authorized urgent care center or provider and do not need a referral. This allows beneficiaries to seek nonemergency care for illnesses or injuries if their primary care provider is unavailable because of emergencies. Any TRICARE beneficiary who reasonably believes they have an emergency should always call 911 or, go to the nearest emergency room.

Beneficiaries are advised to visit Express Scripts’ Weather Notices page for updates.

###

The Defense Health Agency provides health services to 9.5 million beneficiaries, including uniformed service members, military retirees, and their families. The DHA operates one of the nation’s largest health plans, the TRICARE Health Plan, and manages a global network of more than 700 military hospitals, clinics, and dental facilities.

Nila Devanath, a Hampton Roads hospital physician, said she is running to address the high cost of living and to fix the ""broken"" health care system.

""In our hospitals, I see every day what happens when Washington fails to act. Families wait months for care. Veterans are forced to split their pills in half. Patients with diabetes lose their lives avoiding treatment for something as simple as a small cut because they’re afraid of the medical bills that will follow,” Devanath said in her announcement. “Rep. Jen Kiggans and I both swore to care for our patients, but in Washington she’s turned her back on that promise. As a doctor, I can’t stand by while families suffer. I’m running for Congress to fix this broken system for my patients, for our veterans, and for every family who deserves better.”

Devanath grew up in the Hampton Roads region as the daughter of immigrants from Bangladesh. She said her mother worked for the Navy as a TRICARE primary care doctor.

She received her MD from the University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine, but in the middle of it, she took a leave of absence to earn a JD degree from Harvard. After finishing her MD, she completed her residency at Yale New Haven Hospital.

She also said, before she herself became a doctor, that she practiced law and defended survivors of domestic violence while working at a legal aid clinic. She is currently an acute care doctor with Sentara.

Currently, five other Democrats are challenging the Republican incumbent, Jen Kiggans: Patrick Mosolf, a first-time candidate and resident of Virginia Beach; James Osyf, a commander in the Navy reserve; Nicolaus Sleister, a community advocate; John Stringfellow, a teacher; and Michael Williamson, a retired Marine colonel.",https://media.13newsnow.com/assets/WVEC/images/bff5aa85-62db-4029-bcbf-65d2c26f0d6f/20251021T152950/bff5aa85-62db-4029-bcbf-65d2c26f0d6f_1140x641.jpg,N,0.0,2025-10-21 14:02:04.952053

Coverage for certain GLP-1 drugs under TRICARE For Life ended Aug. 31 thanks to a Defense Health Agency (DHA) decision that threatens both the health of those taking these medications and the overall health of the TRICARE For Life (TFL) benefit.

Before the change, TFL beneficiaries who completed a rigorous prior-authorization process to validate obesity-related comorbid medical conditions could secure coverage for GLP-1 drugs approved for weight loss by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA). TRICARE did not cover these drugs for weight loss alone, but rather to improve medical conditions associated with obesity.

TRICARE Prime and Select users retain coverage for these medications under these conditions, while all beneficiaries are still covered for GLP-1 medications to treat Type 2 diabetes.

As MOAA works with DHA officials, lawmakers and their staffs, beneficiaries, and fellow advocacy groups to address this issue, we’ve requested feedback from those who’ve lost drug coverage because of the change. Hundreds have answered the call so far, but the more stories we can share, the stronger our voice becomes.

One MOAA member made his case in a commentary at Military Times, where he shared his personal story while detailing the questionable path DHA officials took to reach their decision.

“In 2001, Congress ended decades of second-class treatment for older retirees with the creation of the Senior Pharmacy Program, guaranteeing Medicare-eligible retirees the same pharmacy coverage as younger beneficiaries,” wrote Col. Derence V. Fivehouse, USAF (Ret). “For more than 20 years, that promise held. When I turned 65, nothing changed: same formulary, same co-pays, same access. Until now…This is not an abstract dispute. It is a matter of health and dignity for older veterans.”

He was far from the only TFL beneficiary to raise concerns about the future of TFL and the betrayal of losing an earned benefit:

“I just don’t understand why a person that served 21 years and deployed in wartime is suddenly being treated like a second-class citizen and any differently from those on TRICARE Prime,” wrote one.

“My biggest concern is that more drugs will be added to the list that TFL won't cover. Although I am a military veteran, I identify as a spouse primarily. I am thankful for all that Tricare has done for my family throughout the years, but we were promised health care coverage for life. If they can start cutting meds from our plan, what is to stop them from cutting the program down the road,” wrote another.

“Am I no longer entitled to equal benefits because I served for over 20 years and now, I’m just too costly to pay for? I am trying to prevent diabetes and maintain a healthy lifestyle. Please fix this egregious error and restore my right to receive equal benefits,” wrote a third.

Taking advantage of these appeals processes is essential, not only for contesting terminations, but especially in response to audit findings.
Pharmacies are strongly encouraged to appeal all audit findings, regardless of the financial impact, as even minor findings can lead to more significant PBM actions if left unchallenged.
PBMs will use multiple adverse audit findings to justify terminating pharmacies from their network, so it is crucial for pharmacies to appeal PBM audit findings and attempt to reduce the amounts at issue to the fullest extent possible.","Recently, Frier Levitt assisted an Illinois-based pharmacy in challenging multiple Pharmacy Benefit Manager’s (“PBM”) audit findings as a service to the TRICARE Pharmacy Program and successfully reversed 100% of the discrepant amounts. In the audit findings, the PBM sought claim data verification for several prescriptions, stating the “Network Provider Refused to or Failed to Provide Requested Information.” Under Frier Levitt’s guidance, the Pharmacy gathered supporting documentation and submitted a robust appeal response challenging the alleged discrepancies, particularly as the PBM withheld the funds despite the Pharmacy’s timely submission of a Grievance Request and Request for Reconsideration. Leveraging Frier Levitt’s experience in addressing PBM audit tactics, the Pharmacy submitted patient records, signed prescriptions, pharmacy work orders, compounding records, progress notes, and delivery tickets demonstrating that the Pharmacy did in fact maintain and provide sufficient claim data verification. Ultimately, the PBM reversed 100% of the audit findings.

The excessive audit findings seen in this case are examples of abusive PBM tactics that have become far too routine in pharmacies’ dealings with PBMs. Being aware of such practices and how they can be remedied is crucial to avoiding negative outcomes for your pharmacy.

While PBMs are increasingly taking disciplinary actions against pharmacies, pharmacies have several effective tools at their disposal to push back against PBM overreach. One of the most important steps pharmacies can take is to implement and maintain comprehensive policies and procedures that ensure compliance with the requirements set forth in PBM Provider Manuals. By doing so, pharmacies can reduce the risk of unfavorable audit outcomes or severe sanctions and, if action is taken by a PBM, they are better positioned to respond effectively.

Moreover, PBM Provider Manuals generally include contractual appeal and dispute resolution processes. These procedures give pharmacies the right to challenge any actions or allegations made by PBMs. Taking advantage of these appeals processes is essential, not only for contesting terminations, but especially in response to audit findings. Pharmacies are strongly encouraged to appeal all audit findings, regardless of the financial impact, as even minor findings can lead to more significant PBM actions if left unchallenged. Timely appeals can result in the reversal of unfounded findings, the release of improperly withheld payments, and a reduced risk of future network termination.

Finally, there is growing momentum among state and federal lawmakers to rein in PBM misconduct. Many states have enacted Fair Audit laws that establish procedural safeguards, including clear limits on what documentation PBMs may demand, when funds can be withheld or recouped, and how audits must be conducted. As regulatory scrutiny of PBM practices increases, additional legislative protections for pharmacies are likely on the horizon.

This matter further demonstrates the importance of combating all PBM audit findings, as PBMs assert unnecessary discrepancies to use pharmacy audits as a source of revenue rather than ensuring compliance with applicable laws and contractual obligations. PBMs will use multiple adverse audit findings to justify terminating pharmacies from their network, so it is crucial for pharmacies to appeal PBM audit findings and attempt to reduce the amounts at issue to the fullest extent possible. Thus, seemingly “insignificant” amounts should be appealed to avoid additional future adverse actions by PBMs.

Until lawmakers pass a funding bill, families and individuals who depend on federal programs face growing financial stress and uncertainty about when relief will come.","As Congress fails to pass spending bills for 2026, thousands of military families and student veterans are caught in limbo as essential services halt or slow across the nation.

By M.J. Cameron

On Oct. 1, the U.S. government shut down for the first time since Dec. 22, 2018. Congress failed to enact the 12 bills for fiscal year 2026 that make up the spending budget before the midnight deadline on Sept. 30.

Each year, Congress is required to pass bills to approve funding for government agencies and organizations. If the bills aren’t passed on time, lawmakers can pass a short-term fix called a continuing resolution to provide temporary spending bills that allow federal operations to continue until final appropriations are enacted according to the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget.

When there is no funding bill or continuing resolution, the government shuts down due to a lack of approved funding.

Serving Arizona’s fourth congressional district, Rep. Greg Stanton said that many agencies must stop or reduce the essential services they provide, and furlough employees until the end of the shutdown. Other essential employees in agencies must keep working without pay until funding is passed.

Under federal law, however, employees who are furloughed or required to work during a shutdown must be paid after it ends for the time the government was closed.

What does this mean for military families?

Active-duty personnel are considered essential; therefore, they must continue their duties without pay. Military families aren’t just worried about paychecks, but the resources and programs they rely on for support according to the National Military Family Association,

The Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants and Children (WIC) may run out of remaining funding quickly, leaving families without food assistance. People receiving health care through Tricare on the base may be affected as there are no protections for routine medical care. Those receiving civilian healthcare with Tricare shouldn’t be affected.

College students may be affected as well. Active-duty, veterans and dependents receiving higher education typically use education benefits such as Chapter 35 for survivors and dependents, post-9/11 GI Bill and the Montgomery GI Bill.

The U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) has stated that benefits will continue to be processed and delivered. Students new to using their benefits, switching schools or changing programs may face delays in payments. Hotlines for education assistance are closed until further notice, leaving students unsure.

As the shutdown continues, millions of military families and students wait for Congress to reach an agreement. Until lawmakers pass a funding bill, families and individuals who depend on federal programs face growing financial stress and uncertainty about when relief will come.

While the end of the shutdown is unknown, families could start accessing what bills to prioritize.",https://thetacomaledger.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/cropped-ledgerLogo-32x32.jpg,N,0.0,2025-10-20 11:19:54.547719
