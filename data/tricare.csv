Military families face unique stressors. Frequent moves, deployments, and separation from family can impact health and well-being. For anyone who may feel they need someone to talk to, the Military Health System is here to help.

“It’s crucial for the military family to seek mental, emotional, and spiritual grounding to fully become a part of the U.S. military at its most ready,” said Susan Orsega, deputy assistant secretary of defense for health services policy and oversight.

“Whether it’s in-person or remote access, in groups, or one-on-one, therapy can help address these pressures and get the service member or families feeling better able to cope before they deepen into crisis,” she said. “Therapy helps sustain readiness and gives service members the necessary mental health support they need during any transitions or challenges they may face.”

Help is more readily available now than ever, Orsega said.

“This is particularly important when service members experience some challenges such as the loss of a sense of purpose, posttraumatic stress disorder, and other mental health symptoms,” she said.

Recognize risks

Service members at risk of harming themselves may feel isolated, agitated, or anxious, according to Military OneSource, the Department of Defense’s 24/7 gateway to family support programs and services for military members and families.

According to Military OneSource, times and events in military life when you can feel especially stressed include:

Times nearing deployment or difficulty readjusting following deployment

Loss of a family member, friend, or fellow service member

Career setbacks, lack of advancement, or disciplinary actions

Difficulty in relationships or family life

Transitioning from military to civilian life

Financial difficulty

Major life changes

Being young and unmarried without a supportive relationship

Combat-related psychological injuries

Heavy drinking or problematic substance use

Medical health problems

Negative attitude toward getting help

Military OneSource provides confidential counseling and support to service members and family members at no cost, available via phone or in person on and off installations. This is just one of many resources the DOD offers to all service members, families and military retirees.

Available MHS mental health resources

The MHS Mental Health Hub provides a comprehensive listing of mental health services available through the MHS. This includes ways to seek care, tips from experts, and in-depth information on available resources. You can connect directly to mental health support services near you with one click.

Targeted Care: Many military mental health clinics are now using a process called Targeted Care. This connects you to the specific type of care you need after an initial evaluation — and can be an individual appointment, in-person group therapy or virtual group therapy, or virtual therapy. You can also receive referrals to nonmedical support such as a chaplain, financial advisor, or a military family life counselor.

TRICARE covers mental health services through its worldwide network of civilian providers. To set up a mental health appointment through TRICARE, visit the mental health doctors and appointments page.

Virtual care: The Defense Health Agency is also working to make mental health services available to service members at remote installations. One example is BRAVE, the DHA’s Behavioral Health Resources and Virtual Experience. This program offers tele-mental health services at 84 locations around the world by connecting a service member with a counselor through virtual sessions.

inTransition is a confidential program that offers specialized coaching and assistance for active duty service members, National Guard and Reserve members, veterans, and retirees. It focuses on those receiving mental health or traumatic brain injury care who are experiencing disruption in their lives, like a PCS (permanent change of station) move, separation, or retirement.

The Real Warriors Campaign is a DOD public health initiative. It strives to decrease stigma, increase psychological health literacy, and encourage early mental health help-seeking behaviors in the military community.

CHAMP, the Uniformed Services University’s Consortium for Health and Military Performance, offers dozens of fact sheets, articles, and infographics to help you strengthen your mental health and grow from adversity or crisis.

Mobile apps are there whenever needed, providing tools for coping, monitoring your health, and managing stress.

The Brandon Act empowers service members to get the help they need confidentially by seeking a referral for a mental health evaluation through their commander or supervisor. This reduces the stigma associated with mental health.

The Warrior Care Recovery Coordination Program, executed by the branches of service, provide holistic care to wounded, ill, or injured Service members and their families and caregivers. Recovery Care Coordinators serve as a guide through recovery, rehabilitation, and transition or reintegration by facilitating a comprehensive recovery plan. This plan covers needs associated with daily living, career, family, finances, health, legal, military, and spirituality.

The MHS is here to help

“The U.S. military wants to support you in your mental health journey. We’re there for you if you need to talk to someone, hit low points, or don’t know where to turn,” Orsega said.

“Together, we’re building a supportive military that knows strength includes the specific support you need, at the moment you need it most. Every service member, veteran, and family member should know: The MHS is here to help, because no one fights alone.”

Virginia Beach, VA—Last week, Rep. Jen Kiggans (VA-02) hosted a roundtable with medical providers, including hospitals and medical clinics, and Humana, to discuss TRICARE reimbursement delays.

Rep. Kiggans said, “We heard from many local providers, including major hospital systems, allied health providers, and smaller providers like those in the mental health field who have been dealing with reimbursement delays and even credentialing challenges. It’s clear there are many policy issues Humana needs to work through. The purpose of this roundtable was to get answers and solutions for our military families who rely on TRICARE—and I believe we have made major progress towards that.”

During the event, many providers discussed the delays in receiving reimbursement for TRICARE, some claiming they experienced delays upwards of six months.

“The last thing our military families and servicemembers need when facing health issues is to be concerned about whether their bills will get paid. In fact, many faced delayed reimbursements and administrative breakdowns that created real hardships.” Rep. Kiggans continued. “That’s why I was so concerned when my team and I heard from countless providers, military families, and retirees about serious TRICARE disruptions. In all, my team has spent over 50 hours attempting to get answers about this problem and this roundtable is just the next step in an effort to correct the issues people are still facing.”

In February, Rep. Kiggans sent a letter to Lt. Gen. Telita Crosland, the Director of the Defense Health Agency (DHA), inquiring about ongoing TRICARE East reimbursement failures and their effects on our military families and community medical providers.

“I’ve heard directly from military families and medical providers in Hampton Roads and across the country who are suffering the consequences of these payment failures,” said Rep. Kiggans. “Small practices, many of which provide critical specialty care, cannot wait months to be reimbursed for services they’ve already provided. Every day these payments are delayed, we risk losing the very providers our servicemembers and their families rely on.”

“We’re grateful to Congresswoman Kiggans for convening this important discussion on TRICARE reimbursement. At Adler Therapy Group, our top priority is ensuring our patients receive the care they deserve, and we remain committed to that mission. We hope Humana addresses the issues causing these delays, so providers can focus on patient care, not administrative hurdles,” said Adler Therapy Group Chief Executive Officer Phil Helman.

“We are grateful to Congresswoman Kiggans for her leadership in convening medical providers, stakeholders, and Humana Military to address persistent challenges within the TRICARE system,” said Rick Dwyer, Executive Director of the Hampton Roads Military and Federal Facilities Alliance. “These systemic issues have resulted in substantial financial burdens for some providers—amounting to millions of dollars in unpaid claims—and have forced others to discontinue acceptance of TRICARE patients or close their practices entirely. The consequences are severe—unacceptably long wait times and diminished access to care for thousands of service members, their families, and veterans across Hampton Roads. This is not just a health care crisis; it’s a matter of military readiness and retention. We deeply appreciate the Congresswoman’s commitment to resolving these critical concerns.”

In conclusion, Rep. Kiggans stated, “As a veteran myself and a nurse practitioner, this issue is personal for me. I believe that we owe it to military families and providers to make sure future transitions are seamless, so that care and payments are never put at risk again. Ultimately, this roundtable was about learning from what went wrong and building safeguards so it doesn’t happen again.”

Background: In January 2025, DHA signed a contract with Humana as its representative for handling the billings and reimbursements for providers who take TRICARE.

– Initial pharmacokinetic (PK) and comparative bioavailability study to initiate in fourth quarter 2025 with pivotal PK trial planned for second half 2026 –

– XWPharma to receive $20 million upfront; potential for development, regulatory and sales milestone payments in addition to royalties on future net sales –

DUBLIN and REDWOOD CITY, Calif., Sept. 03, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Avadel Pharmaceuticals plc (Nasdaq: AVDL), a biopharmaceutical company focused on transforming medicines to transform lives, and XWPharma Ltd. (“XWPharma”) together announced today that Avadel has entered into an exclusive global license agreement with XWPharma to develop and commercialize valiloxybate, a GABA B receptor agonist, for all indications, including the treatment of sleep disorders, such as narcolepsy and idiopathic hypersomnia (“IH”). Valiloxybate has been purposefully designed to deliver the therapeutic benefits of oxybate therapy through a once-at-bedtime, salt-free and artificial sweetener-free formulation.

""The addition of valiloxybate, the only once-at-bedtime, salt-free and artificial sweetener-free, extended-release oxybate, into our portfolio further reflects Avadel’s position as a leader in sleep medicine,” said Greg Divis, Chief Executive Officer of Avadel Pharmaceuticals. “The broad adoption of LUMRYZ demonstrates the transformative benefits that a once-at-bedtime oxybate therapy can bring to patients and their families. As an innovator in the treatment of sleep disorders, we are excited to add valiloxybate to our pipeline.”

“We are pleased to enter into this licensing agreement with Avadel, a recognized leader in the clinical and commercial advancement of once-at-bedtime oxybate therapy and the ideal partner to progress valiloxybate to market,” said James Huang, Executive Chairman of XWPharma. “We are excited for the opportunity to offer access to this innovative therapy to a broad population of those living with sleep disorders.”

“I am thrilled that Avadel is continuing to advance its mission to improve the lives of those living with hypersomnolence disorders by building on the team’s expertise in innovation and novel drug delivery system development,” said Anne Marie Morse, D.O., Director of Pediatric Neurology at Geisinger Medical Center at Janet Weis Children’s Hospital. “The plans to develop valiloxybate for the treatment of narcolepsy and IH with a once at nighttime medication delivery system grows our ability to reach and personalize care for more individuals living with these conditions.”

“Oxybates are transformational medications for people living with narcolepsy and IH, as they provide proven durable efficacy and address the 24 hour a day nature of these disorders. While sodium sensitivity can affect a small proportion of these patients, all patients deserve the benefit of personalized care and the option of a no sodium once at bedtime dosing solution. I believe the additional option of once at bedtime no sodium valiloxybate will further expand utilization and, most importantly, benefit more patients,” continued Dr. Morse.

About the Licensing Agreement

Under the terms of the agreement, XWPharma grants Avadel an exclusive global license to develop, manufacture and commercialize valiloxybate worldwide, excluding mainland China, Hong Kong, and Macau. XWPharma will receive an upfront payment of $20 million from Avadel and is eligible to receive milestone payments associated with certain development milestones of up to $30 million. Avadel has also agreed to pay XWPharma up to an aggregate of $155 million in performance-based tiered sales milestones for first achievement of annual net sales up to $750 million. For first achievement of annual net sales exceeding $750 million and up to $3.5 billion, Avadel will pay XWPharma certain performance-based sales milestone payments equal to 10% of each of those sales milestones. In addition, Avadel has agreed to pay tiered royalties ranging from high-single digit to mid-teens, as a percentage of net sales of the licensed products, and also an additional $10 million milestone payment after the first commercial sale in the U.S. for each indication beyond narcolepsy and IH following FDA approval for same.

Avadel expects to advance its valiloxybate formulation into an initial PK study in the fourth quarter of 2025, followed by a pivotal PK trial in the second half of 2026. The program is expected to benefit from Avadel’s existing infrastructure and commercial capabilities, potentially allowing for efficient clinical and regulatory advancement via a bioequivalence pathway as well as a streamlined commercial launch, if approved.

About Valiloxybate

Valiloxybate is a GABA B receptor agonist, designed to deliver the therapeutic benefits of oxybate therapy through a once-at-bedtime, salt-free and artificial sweetener-free formulation. The molecule’s properties enable extended-release delivery, offering a potentially differentiated profile from traditional oxybate therapies. Importantly, preliminary clinical data suggest the potential for bioequivalence to be established between valiloxybate and Avadel’s LUMRYZ, the first and only once-at-bedtime treatment for cataplexy or excessive daytime sleepiness (EDS) in patients seven years of age and older with narcolepsy. Accordingly, successful completion of the PK clinical program and FDA alignment with our regulatory approach could potentially result in a streamlined and capital-efficient development pathway for valiloxybate.

About LUMRYZ™ (sodium oxybate) for extended-release oral suspension

LUMRYZ is an extended-release sodium oxybate medication approved by the FDA on May 1, 2023, as the first and only once-at-bedtime treatment for cataplexy or excessive daytime sleepiness (EDS) in adults with narcolepsy. On October 16, 2024, LUMRYZ was additionally approved as a once-at-bedtime treatment for cataplexy or EDS in pediatric patients seven years of age and older with narcolepsy.

The FDA approval of LUMRYZ was supported by results from REST-ON™, a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, pivotal Phase 3 trial in adults with narcolepsy. LUMRYZ demonstrated statistically significant and clinically meaningful improvements in the three co-primary endpoints: EDS (MWT), clinicians’ overall assessment of patients’ functioning (CGI-I), and cataplexy attacks, for all three evaluated doses when compared to placebo.

With its approvals in May 2023 and October 2024, the FDA also granted seven years of Orphan Drug Exclusivity to LUMRYZ for the treatment of cataplexy or EDS in adults with narcolepsy and in pediatric patients seven years of age and older with narcolepsy respectively due to a finding of clinical superiority of LUMRYZ relative to currently available oxybate treatments. In particular, the FDA found that LUMRYZ makes a major contribution to patient care over currently available, twice-nightly oxybate products by providing a once-nightly dosing regimen that avoids nocturnal arousal to take a second dose.

LUMRYZ is only currently approved for the treatment of cataplexy or EDS in patients seven years of age and older with narcolepsy, and Avadel does not sell LUMRYZ for any indication beyond narcolepsy.

INDICATIONS

LUMRYZ (sodium oxybate) for extended-release oral suspension is a prescription medicine used to treat the following symptoms in patients seven years of age and older with narcolepsy:

sudden onset of weak or paralyzed muscles (cataplexy)

excessive daytime sleepiness (EDS)

IMPORTANT SAFETY INFORMATION

WARNING: Taking LUMRYZ™ (sodium oxybate) with other central nervous system (CNS) depressants, such as medicines used to make you fall asleep, including opioid analgesics, benzodiazepines, sedating antidepressants, antipsychotics, sedating anti-epileptic medicines, general anesthetics, muscle relaxants, alcohol or street drugs, may cause serious medical problems, including trouble breathing (respiratory depression), low blood pressure (hypotension), changes in alertness (drowsiness), fainting (syncope) and death.

The active ingredient of LUMRYZ (sodium oxybate) is a form of gamma hydroxybutyrate (GHB), a controlled substance. Abuse or misuse of illegal GHB alone or with other CNS depressants (drugs that cause changes in alertness or consciousness) have caused serious side effects. These effects include seizures, trouble breathing (respiratory depression), changes in alertness (drowsiness), coma and death. Call your doctor right away if you have any of these serious side effects.

Because of these risks, LUMRYZ is available only by prescription and filled through certified pharmacies in the LUMRYZ REMS. You must be enrolled in the LUMRYZ REMS to receive LUMRYZ. Further information is available at www.LUMRYZREMS.com or by calling 1-877-453-1029.

Do not take LUMRYZ if you take or your child takes other sleep medicines or sedatives (medicines that cause sleepiness), drink alcohol or have a rare problem called succinic semialdehyde dehydrogenase deficiency.

Keep LUMRYZ in a safe place to prevent abuse and misuse. Selling or giving away LUMRYZ may harm others and is against the law. Tell your doctor if you or your child have ever abused or been dependent on alcohol, prescription medicines or street drugs.

Anyone who takes LUMRYZ should not do anything that requires them to be fully awake or is dangerous, including driving a car, using heavy machinery or flying an airplane, for at least six (6) hours after taking LUMRYZ. Those activities should not be done until you know how LUMRYZ affects you.

Falling asleep quickly, including while standing or while getting up from the bed, has led to falls with injuries that have required some people to be hospitalized.

LUMRYZ can cause serious side effects, including the following:

Breathing problems, including slower breathing, trouble breathing and/or short periods of not breathing while sleeping (e.g., sleep apnea). People who already have breathing or lung problems have a higher chance of having breathing problems when they take LUMRYZ.

Mental health problems , including confusion, seeing or hearing things that are not real (hallucinations), unusual or disturbing thoughts (abnormal thinking), feeling anxious or upset, depression, thoughts of killing yourself or trying to kill yourself, increased tiredness, feelings of guilt or worthlessness and difficulty concentrating. Tell your doctor if you or your child have or had depression or have tried to harm yourself. Call your doctor right away if you or your child have symptoms of mental health problems or a change in weight or appetite.

Sleepwalking. Sleepwalking can cause injuries. Call your doctor if you or your child start sleepwalking.

Tell your doctor if you or your child are on a salt-restricted diet or have high blood pressure, heart failure or kidney problems. LUMRYZ contains a lot of sodium (salt) and may not be right for you.

The most common side effects of LUMRYZ in adults include nausea, dizziness, bedwetting, headache and vomiting. Your side effects may increase when you take higher doses of LUMRYZ. The most common side effects in children include nausea, bedwetting, vomiting, headache, decreased weight, decreased appetite, dizziness, and sleepwalking.

LUMRYZ can cause physical dependence and craving for the medicine when it is not taken as directed. These are not all the possible side effects of LUMRYZ.

For more information, ask your doctor or pharmacist. Call your doctor for medical advice about side effects.

You are encouraged to report negative side effects of prescription drugs to the FDA. Visit http://www.fda.gov/medwatch , or call 1-800-FDA-1088.

SALT LAKE CITY, Sept. 03, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Myriad Genetics, Inc. , (NASDAQ: MYGN), a leader in molecular diagnostic testing and precision medicine, today announced the publication of a new meta-analysis of six prospective controlled studies 1 that included 3,532 adults with major depressive disorder (MDD). The meta-analysis showed that when GeneSight ® Psychotropic test results were available to treating clinicians, there were significant improvements in response and remission rates for patients with MDD, compared to treatment as usual (TAU).

Specifically, compared to TAU, patients in the GeneSight arm were:

41% more likely to achieve remission.

30% more likely to achieve response.

“This meta-analysis summarizes the clinical evidence of the GeneSight test, demonstrating superiority over treatment as usual—which often involves repeated medication trials,” said Sagar V. Parikh, M.D., FRCPC, study author, professor of psychiatry at the University of Michigan, associate director of the University of Michigan Depression Center. “This study found that the GeneSight test can be a powerful tool to augment a clinician’s knowledge, experience and passion for their patients’ recovery.”

The large-scale data analysis—merging data over many independent studies—provides evidence of the clinical utility of the GeneSight Psychotropic test for patients with MDD who have experienced at least one treatment failure.

“Depression is not just a mental health issue—it’s a public health priority. If we want to improve overall outcomes and enhance quality of life, we must treat depression with the same urgency and resources as any other chronic condition,” said Dale Muzzey, PhD, chief scientific officer, Myriad Genetics. “This meta-analysis adds to our confidence in the clinical validity and utility of the GeneSight test.”

Myriad Genetics plans to submit this data to payers as part of ongoing efforts to increase patient access to the GeneSight test and help patients achieve remission from depression.

About the Meta-Analysis

The study analyzed six prospective, controlled trials to assess the impact of the GeneSight Psychotropic test on clinical outcomes in a total of 3,532 unique adults with MDD who had at least one prior treatment failure. The trials included in the meta-analysis incorporated the widely used depression questionnaires, the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HAM-D17) and the Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9), to assess severity of depression symptoms. Response was defined as a 50% or greater improvement in depression scores from baseline to endpoint. Remission was defined as a score of seven or less on the HAM-D17 or a score of five or less on the PHQ-9.

About the GeneSight ® Test

The GeneSight Psychotropic test from Myriad Genetics is the category-leading pharmacogenomic test for 64 medications commonly prescribed for depression, anxiety, ADHD, and other psychiatric conditions. The GeneSight test can help inform clinicians about how a patient’s genes may impact how they metabolize and/or respond to certain psychiatric medications. It is designed to provide information that may help reduce the trial-and-error process that often takes place when patients are prescribed certain mental health medications.

PHOENIX, Sept. 03, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- WillScot Holdings Corporation (“WillScot” or the “Company”) (Nasdaq: WSC), a leader in innovative temporary space solutions, today announced that the Company’s Board of Directors (the “Board”) has unanimously elected Tim Boswell to succeed Brad Soultz as Chief Executive Officer, effective January 1, 2026, and Mr. Boswell will also join the Board at that time. The Company also announced that effective immediately, Worthing Jackman, current non-Executive Chairman of the Board, will now serve as Executive Chairman of the Board, both to continue to lead the Board and to assist the CEO and senior management team in achieving the Company’s strategic plan. In addition, Jeff Sagansky, a member of the Board since 2017, was appointed Lead Independent Director, also effective immediately.

During his 13-year career at WillScot, Mr. Boswell has been instrumental in the Company’s growth and development, holding multiple leadership roles across finance and operations. As President and Chief Operating Officer, and previously President and Chief Financial Officer, he has driven efforts to build and scale the Company’s operations. Mr. Boswell has extensive capital markets experience, as well as has led the development and execution of various strategic initiatives, including M&A, pricing and marketing, in addition to developing and executing the addition of Value-Added Products and Services (“VAPS”).

Mr. Jackman commented, “I have been deeply involved in the CEO succession planning process, which was underway when I joined the Board, and I strongly believe this is the right path forward. Tim has played an important role in leading the business, and his skills and commitment are clear. Having gone through the transition from CFO to CEO in a previous role myself, I know the demands of the transition and am confident he is well-prepared. The rest of the Board and I look forward to supporting Tim as he guides the Company into its next chapter.”

Continued Mr. Jackman, “During my time on the Board, I have worked alongside my fellow directors to carefully understand and evaluate our long-term plan and I feel confident that WillScot is executing the right strategy. Under Tim’s leadership, we expect to continue that focus on growth and execution, with increased urgency and accountability, to drive value creation for our shareholders.”

“The Board recognizes the many contributions Brad has made as WillScot has scaled its portfolio and transformed the financial profile of the business, growing revenues over 5x and free cash flow to more than $500 million during his tenure as CEO. We would not be the Company we are today without his tireless dedication,” Mr. Jackman concluded.

“I feel a deep sense of gratitude to my colleagues and the entire team for what we’ve achieved together. The transformation of the business would not have been possible without the talent, commitment and collaboration of this world class team,” added Mr. Soultz. “I have had the pleasure of collaborating with Tim over the last 12 years and am delighted to have him succeed me as the business remains focused on continuing to deliver on its strategic milestones.”

Mr. Boswell added, “It is a privilege to be named CEO of WillScot, and I am thankful to the Board for their trust and to Brad for his years of dedication and guidance. Together with our talented team, I am confident we will continue to strengthen our market position and create value for our shareholders. Over the past year, serving as COO has given me the privilege of getting even closer to the business and serving employees across the organization. I am honored and humbled to take on this position and excited to work with the whole team to drive our continued success.”

Jeff Sagansky, Lead Independent Director of the Board, said, “Worthing has a long term track record of driving superior shareholder returns. The Board and I expect his active leadership as Executive Chair in support and partnership with Tim to reignite growth and improved performance.”

Beginning Sept. 15, 2025, The DiRaimondo and Butts Army Airfield pharmacies will be closed due to staffing and funding constraints. Soldiers who currently pick up their medication at either of those two locations will be diverted to either the Soldier Readiness Center or Soldier Family Care Center pharmacies for new prescriptions, with continued convenient prescription activation through Q-Anywhere.

In addition, prescription refills will no longer be available for pick-up at the Soldier Readiness Center. Prescription refills will continue to be available at the SFCC or at ScriptCenter kiosks at EACH and the Fort Carson Exchange.

“These changes are being implemented to maximize pharmacy service delivery, minimize disruption, and ensure safe medication delivery to our beneficiaries,” said Maj.

The Soldier Readiness Center changes, however, are permanent.

Previously, TRICARE beneficiaries could pick up prescription refills at the SRC pharmacy, but they’ll now have to use one of the other options mentioned above.

“We are working closely with our providers and pharmacy staff to ensure patients are aware of the changes, but that information is also available on our public website and on flyers at each pharmacy location,” Darbouze said. “We apologize for the inconvenience, but we are doing all we can with the resources that are available to us.

For centuries, gambling has been a popular form of entertainment and leisure activity, but for some, it can be a source of risk and harm—and service members are no exception.

Historically, military members tend to gamble more often than their civilian counterparts. Research indicates certain factors associated with military service increase the risk for gambling problems among those actively serving and for those who served. A 2021 study found that problem gambling scores for past and current service members were more than double those of the civilians studied. The 2020 DOD Health Related Behaviors Survey indicated 51.3% of active duty service members reported engaging in some form of gambling in the previous year.

While gambling is generally considered recreational, it can adversely impact military personnel, their families, and unit readiness.

“Unhealthy gambling behaviors are an increasing problem across the Armed Forces today due to the ease of online/app sports betting,” said U.S. Army Lt. Col. Isaac Lopez, a clinical psychologist with Defense Health Agency-Public Health in Aberdeen, Maryland. “This behavior is increasingly troublesome as research has shown it can lead to more significant problems to include increased risk of substance abuse and behavioral health symptoms.”

Problem gambling impacts

Several factors contribute to higher rates of military gambling; examples include its being seen as either a way to develop cohesion or escape from stress and boredom, and 24-hour online and phone app access. Service members also tend to be risk-takers and are often more willing to engage in high-risk activities.

Studies have also connected alcohol use to rates of gambling, linking increased drinking with more significant amounts of gambling. More gambling typically leads to a higher risk for harm, such as financial difficulties, relationship problems, and mental health concerns.

Gambling can have a negative impact on physical health, especially for those engaging in high-risk gambling. For instance, risky gambling can lead to sleep deprivation, poor nutrition and substance abuse. Financial concerns resulting from gambling can bring about stress-related problems such as hypertension and increased tobacco, nicotine, and substance use.

Daily behavioral health can be influenced by high-risk gambling, increasing the chances of anxiety, depression, and suicidal thinking. A risk-taking gambling style can also aggravate existing mental health problems, such as substance use and posttraumatic stress. Excessive gambling may also result in relationship issues, including separation, divorce, and domestic violence, and may increase the risk for criminal behavior, such as theft and fraud.

According to the National Council on Problem Gambling, problem gambling is defined as ""gambling behavior that causes disruptions in any major area of life: psychological, physical, social, or vocational."" The NCPG estimates that approximately 2 million Americans meet the criteria for problem gambling, with another 4–6 million experiencing problems related to their gambling behaviors.

Safe gambling techniques

A way to reduce the harm that can result from gambling is to practice safe gambling techniques. The first step is to view gambling as a leisure activity, not a way to make money. While winning is always possible, losing is just as likely. In fact, with the odds set in favor of the gaming industry, losing money over time is more likely, making it essential to gamble only with an affordable amount of money to lose.

Setting limits on both time and money spent on gambling is a technique that helps reduce gambling harm. Deciding in advance how much time and money to spend on gambling and sticking to that amount keeps more of your money in your pocket. Once the time or money limit has been reached, it is time to stop. Also, gambling is best experienced as a social activity with trusted friends; avoid gambling alone.

Another technique for reducing gambling harm is not chasing losses. Gambling to win back money lost can quickly become out of control and often leads to more losses. It’s important to accept that gambling involves losing, and the odds are not set in your favor. Using gambling tools that provide feedback on amounts spent can help prevent chasing losses and preserve any winnings earned.

Tips for sensible gambling

For many, gambling can be a fun and exciting activity, but it is important to realize you may win some of the time but will lose most of the time. The following tips can help you gamble sensibly:

Set a budget. Determine how much of your money you are willing to gamble; when you have reached that amount, stop gambling.

Don't chase losses. If you lose money while gambling, don't try to win it back by continuing to gamble. Doing so can lead to even bigger losses.

Take breaks. Gambling can be addictive, so it's essential to take regular breaks to help you stay in control and reduce the risk of problem gambling.

Don't gamble when you're stressed or upset. Gambling can be a way to take a break from daily life, but it is not a way to deal with stress or negative emotions. If you are feeling stressed or upset, don’t gamble; instead, find healthy and safe ways to relax and cope with your feelings.

Don't gamble if you have a history of addiction. If you have a history of addiction, gambling is not a healthy activity for you. Talk to your healthcare provider about ways to manage your addiction and avoid gambling altogether.

Know the odds. Before gambling, understand how the odds work and the risks of winning and losing. This knowledge will help you decide how much of your money you’re willing to risk and when to stop gambling.

Don't let gambling interfere with your life. If you decide to participate in gambling, do not let it interfere with your work, relationships, or other vital aspects of your life. If it does, it’s time to seek help.

Following these tips will help you experience gambling while lowering the risk of harmful outcomes.

Resources

When gambling becomes hard to manage or is out of control, it can become self-destructive, like a substance use disorder. Indicators of addictive behavior include spending more time or money gambling than intended, feeling anxious or irritable when not gambling, hiding or lying about personal gambling habits, having financial difficulties because of gambling, and avoiding responsibilities at work or in relationships to spend time gambling instead.

If any of these signs is present, it is time to seek help. It’s not uncommon for gamblers to feel isolated or ashamed; some may even have thoughts of suicide. There are resources available to find support for gambling concerns:

Military families face unique stressors. Frequent moves, deployments, and separation from family can impact health and well-being. For anyone who may feel they need someone to talk to, the Military Health System is here to help.

“It’s crucial for the military family to seek mental, emotional, and spiritual grounding to fully become a part of the U.S. military at its most ready,” said Susan Orsega, deputy assistant secretary of defense for health services policy and oversight.

“Whether it’s in-person or remote access, in groups, or one-on-one, therapy can help address these pressures and get the service member or families feeling better able to cope before they deepen into crisis,” she said. “Therapy helps sustain readiness and gives service members the necessary mental health support they need during any transitions or challenges they may face.”

Help is more readily available now than ever, Orsega said.

“This is particularly important when service members experience some challenges such as the loss of a sense of purpose, posttraumatic stress disorder, and other mental health symptoms,” she said.

Recognize risks

Service members at risk of harming themselves may feel isolated, agitated, or anxious, according to Military OneSource, the Department of Defense’s 24/7 gateway to family support programs and services for military members and families.

According to Military OneSource, times and events in military life when you can feel especially stressed include:

• Times nearing deployment or difficulty readjusting following deployment

• Loss of a family member, friend, or fellow service member

• Career setbacks, lack of advancement, or disciplinary actions

• Difficulty in relationships or family life

• Transitioning from military to civilian life

• Financial difficulty

• Major life changes

• Being young and unmarried without a supportive relationship

• Combat-related psychological injuries

• Heavy drinking or problematic substance use

• Medical health problems

• Negative attitude toward getting help

Military OneSource provides confidential counseling and support to service members and family members at no cost, available via phone or in person on and off installations. This is just one of many resources the DOD offers to all service members, families and military retirees.

Available MHS mental health resources

The MHS Mental Health Hub provides a comprehensive listing of mental health services available through the MHS. This includes ways to seek care, tips from experts, and in-depth information on available resources. You can connect directly to mental health support services near you with one click.

• Targeted Care: Many military mental health clinics are now using a process called Targeted Care. This connects you to the specific type of care you need after an initial evaluation — and can be an individual appointment, in-person group therapy or virtual group therapy, or virtual therapy. You can also receive referrals to nonmedical support such as a chaplain, financial advisor, or a military family life counselor.

• TRICARE covers mental health services through its worldwide network of civilian providers. To set up a mental health appointment through TRICARE, visit the mental health doctors and appointments page.

• Virtual care: The Defense Health Agency is also working to make mental health services available to service members at remote installations. One example is BRAVE, the DHA’s Behavioral Health Resources and Virtual Experience. This program offers tele-mental health services at 84 locations around the world by connecting a service member with a counselor through virtual sessions.

• inTransition is a confidential program that offers specialized coaching and assistance for active duty service members, National Guard and Reserve members, veterans, and retirees. It focuses on those receiving mental health or traumatic brain injury care who are experiencing disruption in their lives, like a PCS (permanent change of station) move, separation, or retirement.

• The Real Warriors Campaign is a DOD public health initiative. It strives to decrease stigma, increase psychological health literacy, and encourage early mental health help-seeking behaviors in the military community.

• CHAMP, the Uniformed Services University’s Consortium for Health and Military Performance, offers dozens of fact sheets, articles, and infographics to help you strengthen your mental health and grow from adversity or crisis.

• Mobile apps are there whenever needed, providing tools for coping, monitoring your health, and managing stress.

• The Brandon Act empowers service members to get the help they need confidentially by seeking a referral for a mental health evaluation through their commander or supervisor. This reduces the stigma associated with mental health.

• The Warrior Care Recovery Coordination Program, executed by the branches of service, provide holistic care to wounded, ill, or injured Service members and their families and caregivers. Recovery Care Coordinators serve as a guide through recovery, rehabilitation, and transition or reintegration by facilitating a comprehensive recovery plan. This plan covers needs associated with daily living, career, family, finances, health, legal, military, and spirituality.

While winning is always possible, losing is just as likely. In fact, with the odds set in favor of the gaming industry, losing money over time is more likely, making it essential to gamble only with an affordable amount of money to lose.

Setting limits on both time and money spent on gambling is a technique that helps reduce gambling harm. Deciding in advance how much time and money to spend on gambling and sticking to that amount keeps more of your money in your pocket. Once the time or money limit has been reached, it is time to stop. Also, gambling is best experienced as a social activity with trusted friends; avoid gambling alone.

Another technique for reducing gambling harm is not chasing losses. Gambling to win back money lost can quickly become out of control and often leads to more losses. It’s important to accept that gambling involves losing, and the odds are not set in your favor. Using gambling tools that provide feedback on amounts spent can help prevent chasing losses and preserve any winnings earned.

Tips for sensible gambling

For many, gambling can be a fun and exciting activity, but it is important to realize you may win some of the time but will lose most of the time. The following tips can help you gamble sensibly:

• Set a budget. Determine how much of your money you are willing to gamble; when you have reached that amount, stop gambling.

• Don't chase losses. If you lose money while gambling, don't try to win it back by continuing to gamble. Doing so can lead to even bigger losses.

• Take breaks. Gambling can be addictive, so it's essential to take regular breaks to help you stay in control and reduce the risk of problem gambling.

• Don't gamble when you're stressed or upset. Gambling can be a way to take a break from daily life, but it is not a way to deal with stress or negative emotions. If you are feeling stressed or upset, don’t gamble; instead, find healthy and safe ways to relax and cope with your feelings.

• Don't gamble if you have a history of addiction. If you have a history of addiction, gambling is not a healthy activity for you. Talk to your healthcare provider about ways to manage your addiction and avoid gambling altogether.

• Know the odds. Before gambling, understand how the odds work and the risks of winning and losing. This knowledge will help you decide how much of your money you’re willing to risk and when to stop gambling.

• Don't let gambling interfere with your life. If you decide to participate in gambling, do not let it interfere with your work, relationships, or other vital aspects of your life. If it does, it’s time to seek help.

Following these tips will help you experience gambling while lowering the risk of harmful outcomes.

Resources

When gambling becomes hard to manage or is out of control, it can become self-destructive, like a substance use disorder. Indicators of addictive behavior include spending more time or money gambling than intended, feeling anxious or irritable when not gambling, hiding or lying about personal gambling habits, having financial difficulties because of gambling, and avoiding responsibilities at work or in relationships to spend time gambling instead.

If any of these signs is present, it is time to seek help. It’s not uncommon for gamblers to feel isolated or ashamed; some may even have thoughts of suicide. There are resources available to find support for gambling concerns:

At our residential aged care facilities, the Brisbane Royal Exhibition Show, affectionately known as the Ekka, is more than just a seasonal event. It’s a cherished tradition that brings joy, colour, and a sense of community to our residents, many of whom have fond memories of attending the show with their children and grandchildren over the decades.

Bertie Beetle Show bags at Mt Gravatt Aged Care Residence Ekka Celebration

This year, our facilities came alive with the sights, sounds, and flavours of the Ekka. From homemade strawberry sundaes and fairy floss to arts and crafts displays and mock showbags, every detail was lovingly recreated to evoke the magic of the exhibition. Staff dressed in country-themed attire, and residents enjoyed live music, petting zoos, and even a mini sideshow alley, complete with games and prizes.

But beyond the festivities, the Ekka celebration was a heartfelt tribute to the past. Many residents shared stories of taking their grandchildren to the show, watching the fireworks together, or enjoying the thrill of the rides and the agricultural displays. These moments, filled with laughter and love, were brought back to life through photo boards, memory walls, and storytelling sessions.

One resident, Betty, recalled how she used to bake treats for her grandchildren before heading to the show: “We’d pack a little picnic and sit on the grass near the main arena. The kids loved the horses and the showjumping. It was our special day every year.”

Strawberry Ice Cream at the Sunnybank Hills Aged Care Residence Ekka Celebration

These shared memories not only sparked joy but also strengthened bonds between generations. Families were invited to join the celebrations, and many grandchildren visited to hear stories firsthand, creating new memories while honouring old ones.

At the heart of our Ekka tribute is a deep respect for the lives our residents have lived and the traditions they hold dear. Celebrating the Ekka is our way of saying: your stories matter, your joy matters, and your legacy continues to inspire.

Yesterday (Labor Day) it was unbearable and getting worse so I contacted the VA who referred me to an urgent care clinic. I went in and they told me possibly bronchitis or pneumonia, prescribed me some steroids and an inhaler and sent me on my way.

This morning it was even worse so I called the tricare nurse advice line. They tried getting me in to my PCM, but were unable so they recommended I go to the ER.

It may include funny memes, entertainment and news stories, and pictures and updates from friends and family. With so much to scroll through, it can be difficult to spot a concerning post made by a fellow warrior, friend, or family member when they may be thinking about suicide.

Learn how to recognize the warning signs of suicide on social media and what you can do to help. Recognizing the signs and taking the right steps can save lives.

What to look for

Signs of emotional crisis or thoughts of suicide are not always obvious on social media. A fellow warrior, friend, or loved one may share that they are going through a challenging time and may mention feeling hopeless or ending their lives. They might frame these statements as a joke or even include a meme or a lighthearted emoji. Regardless of how casual they seem, these posts can be signs of more serious psychological health concerns.

If someone you know makes comments about suicide or expresses emotional pain online, always take them seriously. Whether it's a single post or multiple, do not ignore them. In addition to posts that directly reference dying, signs of emotional crisis in social media posts may include those that mention:

Self-medicating in response to emotional or physical pain

Feeling alone or isolated

Feeling guilt, shame, anger, or rage (seeking revenge)

Feeling like a burden to coworkers or loved ones

Feeling trapped or in unbearable pain

Expressing hopelessness or having no reason to live

Saying goodbye or expressing a desire to escape

Describing methods of suicide

Some of the above signs may be expressed through images as well. If you spot a post that contains one or more of the above signs, it could indicate that the person is in crisis. Do not wait for someone else to respond. Reaching out and taking the right action may save their life.

What to do

A common misconception is that by asking someone about suicide, you are putting the idea into their head. However, reaching out is one of the most helpful things you can do. If you notice someone engaging with social media in a concerning way, immediately reach out to them through private message or chat, or by calling or meeting with them in person. Starting the conversation can be as simple as saying, ""It seems like you're going through a hard time right now. Can we talk?""

Follow these three simple steps when reaching out:

Ask:

Are they considering suicide?

Listen:

Check in with them and see how they are feeling. Listen to their concerns and remind them that they are not alone.

Get Help:

Speak with a trained crisis responder through the Veterans/Military Crisis Line: dial 988 and press 1 or text 838255.

They can provide guidance to you and/or the person in crisis and help connect you with services.

If they are in immediate danger of suicide, call 911.

Are you calling the Military/Veterans Crisis Line from overseas? The country code to reach the United States will be required for each of these numbers, depending on your location.

Europe, call: 844-702-5495 or DSN 988

Pacific, call: 844-702-5493 or DSN 988

Southwest Asia, call: 855-422-7719 or DSN 988

Contact the Safety Team:

Along with reaching out directly and providing crisis resources, you should also alert the social media platform's safety team. While each platform's protocol is different, generally they will assess the post and reach out to the user with resources to connect them with help. To learn more about the safety teams and protocols visit Facebook, X, Instagram, and Snapchat.

For many Americans, turning 65 is a milestone not just in life but in healthcare. While some people can delay Medicare without penalty, others are required to enroll immediately to avoid costly mistakes. Knowing which group you fall into can mean the difference between smooth coverage and a lifetime of penalties.

The Five Groups Required to Enroll at 65

No Employer or Group Coverage

If you’re not working and don’t have insurance through your own job or your spouse’s employer plan, Medicare enrollment at 65 is mandatory. Failing to sign up leaves you uninsured and subject to penalties.

Employees of Small Companies (19 or Fewer Employees)

For workers at small businesses, Medicare becomes the primary payer at age 65, and the employer’s plan shifts to secondary coverage. If you don’t enroll in Medicare, you could be responsible for most of your medical bills.

ACA, Marketplace, or Obamacare Plans

Affordable Care Act (ACA) plans stop making financial sense once you turn 65. Premium credits and tax subsidies vanish, and you’re required to transition to Medicare. Staying on ACA could cost you far more than switching.

Retired Military with Tricare or Tricare for Life

Tricare requires enrollment in Medicare Part B at age 65. Without it, you risk losing Tricare coverage and may face permanent late enrollment penalties. Active-duty military are the only exception until their service ends.

COBRA Participants

If you’re on COBRA when you turn 65, you still need to enroll in Medicare. COBRA drops to secondary coverage, paying only 20% of claims—leaving you responsible for the other 80% if you don’t sign up for Medicare.

Enrollment Timeline and Process

Your Initial Enrollment Period (IEP) begins three months before your 65th birthday, includes your birth month, and extends three months after. Enrolling early ensures coverage starts the first day of your birth month. Waiting until or after your birthday can delay coverage by up to three months.

Already on Social Security? You’ll be enrolled automatically, with your Medicare card arriving about 100 days before your birthday.

Not on Social Security? You must enroll yourself either at ssa.gov, by submitting paper forms, or with help from a Medicare educator.

Penalties for Missing the Deadline

The stakes are high if you miss your Medicare Part B enrollment:

10% penalty added to your premium for every 12 months of delay.

Penalties last for life.

For Tricare members, skipping enrollment risks losing Tricare altogether.

COBRA participants without Medicare at 65 could face massive out-of-pocket costs, as COBRA won’t cover what Medicare should.

How Medicare Coordinates with Other Coverage

When you turn 65:

Small employer plans, Tricare, and COBRA all move to secondary status, meaning Medicare pays first.

Tricare + Medicare together provide excellent, comprehensive coverage, including drug benefits.

COBRA can still cover younger spouses or dependents, but the primary enrollee must transition to Medicare.

Getting Help with Enrollment

Navigating Medicare’s rules can feel overwhelming, but you don’t have to do it alone. Experts like Erica Smiley at MedicareSchool.com help seniors:

Understand whether they need to enroll at 65

Compare plan options (Medigap, Advantage, Part D)

Avoid penalties and gaps in coverage

If you’re approaching 65, review your coverage early, check your Initial Enrollment Period dates, and get help if you’re unsure. A misstep could cost you for life.

According to a recent report from KNSI Radio, 40-year-old Adelle Starin – who operated a store that sold baby products and toys – made false claims for reimbursement to the healthcare program TRICARE to the tune of $9 million.

Authorities say that TRICARE initially paid out the claims, but when it started rejecting them, she created a fictitious shell company – Sunshine Medical LLC – in which she falsely claimed she represented two lenders who needed financing to purchase supplies from her firm.

However, according to a previous press release from the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ), her firm “had no business operations or revenue.” Therefore, to pull off the scheme, she had to create fake invoices for Sunshine Medical LLC and send them to the lenders she claimed the firm represented.

All in all, she fraudulently raked in $9 million from her fabrications to TRICARE.

She pleaded guilty to wire fraud in December 2024 and was sentenced to three years of probation and ordered to pay $2.35 million in restitution in addition to her time behind bars.
